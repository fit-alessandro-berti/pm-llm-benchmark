### Identified Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors

1. **Case 1002: Out-of-Sequence Process Flow**
   - **Anomaly:** The event flow deviates from the normal process by performing "Confirm Shipment" and "Ship Goods" **before** "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock".
   - **Indicator:** 
     - `event_id` 9: "Confirm Shipment" occurs immediately after "Register Order".
     - `additional_info` includes `attempted_early=Y`, suggesting an intentional early attempt to confirm shipment.

2. **Case 1003: Multiple Out-of-Sequence Steps**
   - **Anomaly:** The sequence includes "Ship Goods" and "Issue Invoice" **before** "Confirm Shipment".
   - **Indicators:**
     - `event_id` 17: "Ship Goods" precedes "Confirm Shipment".
     - `event_id` 19: "Confirm Shipment" is marked with `late_confirmation=Y`, indicating delayed confirmation.

3. **Case 1004: Immediate Payment Before Standard Process Steps**
   - **Anomaly:** "Receive Payment" occurs **immediately** after "Register Order", bypassing essential steps like "Perform Credit Check", "Validate Stock", and others.
   - **Indicators:**
     - `event_id` 22: "Receive Payment" occurs just 5 minutes after "Register Order".
     - `additional_info` includes `shipment_scheduled=N`, indicating that shipment was not scheduled as expected.

### Hypotheses for Identified Anomalies

1. **System Errors or Misconfigurations:**
   - Automated workflows may have bugs causing steps to execute out of order.
   - Misconfigured process automation tools might not enforce the correct sequence of activities.

2. **Policy Violations or Bypassing Procedures:**
   - Employees might be intentionally skipping required steps to expedite order processing.
   - Lack of proper oversight or checks allowing deviations from the standard process.

3. **Training Issues:**
   - Staff may be inadequately trained, leading to misunderstandings of the correct process flow.
   - New employees might inadvertently skip steps due to lack of experience.

4. **Exceptional Circumstances:**
   - High-priority orders might have altered workflows to meet urgent delivery requirements.
   - Special cases or custom orders may legitimately bypass certain standard steps.

### Proposed SQL Queries for Further Investigation

1. **Identify All Cases with Out-of-Sequence Activities:**
   ```sql
   WITH ordered_events AS (
       SELECT 
           case_id, 
           activity, 
           timestamp, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS event_order
       FROM order_event_log
   )
   SELECT 
       oe1.case_id,
       oe1.activity AS activity1,
       oe1.event_order AS order1,
       oe2.activity AS activity2,
       oe2.event_order AS order2
   FROM ordered_events oe1
   JOIN ordered_events oe2
       ON oe1.case_id = oe2.case_id
       AND oe1.event_order = oe2.event_order - 1
   WHERE 
       (oe1.activity = 'Register Order' AND oe2.activity != 'Perform Credit Check') OR
       (oe1.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND oe2.activity != 'Validate Stock') OR
       (oe1.activity = 'Validate Stock' AND oe2.activity != 'Confirm Shipment') OR
       (oe1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND oe2.activity != 'Ship Goods') OR
       (oe1.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND oe2.activity != 'Issue Invoice') OR
       (oe1.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND oe2.activity != 'Receive Payment');
   ```

2. **Check for Early Shipment Confirmations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       case_id, 
       event_id, 
       activity, 
       timestamp, 
       additional_info
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
     AND additional_info LIKE '%attempted_early=Y%';
   ```

3. **Analyze Payment Received Before Required Steps:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       oel.case_id, 
       oel.event_id, 
       oel.activity, 
       oel.timestamp,
       o.order_type,
       o.order_value
   FROM order_event_log oel
   JOIN orders o ON oel.case_id = o.case_id
   WHERE oel.activity = 'Receive Payment'
     AND EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 
         FROM order_event_log oel_inner
         WHERE oel_inner.case_id = oel.case_id
           AND oel_inner.activity IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock')
           AND oel_inner.timestamp > oel.timestamp
     );
   ```

4. **Identify Cases with Late Shipment Confirmations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       case_id, 
       event_id, 
       activity, 
       timestamp, 
       additional_info
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
     AND additional_info LIKE '%late_confirmation=Y%';
   ```

5. **Examine Orders with Missing Shipment Scheduling:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       oel.case_id, 
       oel.event_id, 
       oel.activity, 
       oel.timestamp, 
       oel.additional_info,
       o.order_type,
       o.order_value
   FROM order_event_log oel
   JOIN orders o ON oel.case_id = o.case_id
   WHERE oel.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
     AND oel.additional_info LIKE '%shipment_scheduled=N%';
   ```

6. **Aggregate and Compare Process Flow Durations:**
   ```sql
   WITH process_flow AS (
       SELECT 
           case_id,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN timestamp END) AS register_order_time,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS receive_payment_time
       FROM order_event_log
       GROUP BY case_id
   )
   SELECT 
       pf.case_id,
       o.order_type,
       o.order_value,
       pf.register_order_time,
       pf.receive_payment_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (pf.receive_payment_time - pf.register_order_time)) / 3600 AS processing_hours
   FROM process_flow pf
   JOIN orders o ON pf.case_id = o.case_id
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (pf.receive_payment_time - pf.register_order_time)) / 3600 < 24; -- Assuming normal processing takes longer
   ```

7. **Investigate Resource Roles Involved in Anomalies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       oel.case_id, 
       oel.event_id, 
       oel.activity, 
       oel.resource,
       r.role,
       r.department
   FROM order_event_log oel
   JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
   WHERE oel.case_id IN (
       -- List of case_ids identified with anomalies, e.g., 1002, 1003, 1004
       1002, 1003, 1004
   )
   ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.event_id;
   ```

8. **Detect High-Value Orders with Deviations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       oel.case_id, 
       oel.event_id, 
       oel.activity, 
       oel.timestamp,
       o.order_value
   FROM order_event_log oel
   JOIN orders o ON oel.case_id = o.case_id
   WHERE o.order_value > 2000.00 -- Threshold for high-value orders
     AND oel.case_id IN (
         SELECT case_id
         FROM order_event_log
         GROUP BY case_id
         HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN activity NOT IN (
             'Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 
             'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment'
         ) THEN 1 END) > 0
     );
   ```

### Next Steps

By executing the above SQL queries, you can:

- **Validate the Identified Anomalies:** Confirm whether the deviations observed in the event logs are consistent across multiple cases.
  
- **Understand the Root Causes:** Analyze if specific resources or departments are frequently involved in anomalies, indicating potential training or policy issues.
  
- **Assess the Impact on Order Processing:** Determine if anomalies correlate with delays, increased costs, or customer dissatisfaction.
  
- **Implement Corrective Measures:** Based on findings, enhance system configurations, reinforce policy compliance, or provide additional training to staff as necessary.
