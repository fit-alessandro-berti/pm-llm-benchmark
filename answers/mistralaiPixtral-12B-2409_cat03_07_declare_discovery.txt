Certainly! Below is a Python dictionary representing a DECLARE model for the given process variants. This model includes constraints based on the activities and their occurrences as described.

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Add penalty': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send for Credit Collection': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Appeal to Judge': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'absence': {
        # Add activities that should not occur if needed
    },
    'exactly_one': {
        # Add activities that should occur exactly once if needed
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        # Add more pairs if needed
    },
    'coexistence': {
        # Add pairs of activities that must co-occur if needed
    },
    'response': {
        # Add pairs of activities where the second should occur after the first if needed
    },
    'precedence': {
        # Add pairs of activities where the first should occur before the second if needed
    },
    'succession': {
        # Add pairs of activities where both response and precedence constraints are satisfied if needed
    },
    'altresponse': {
        # Add pairs of activities where the second should occur after the first without repetitions if needed
    },
    'altprecedence': {
        # Add pairs of activities where the first should occur before the second without repetitions if needed
    },
    'altsuccession': {
        # Add pairs of activities where both response and precedence constraints are satisfied without repetitions if needed
    },
    'chainresponse': {
        # Add pairs of activities where the directly-follows relation should be imposed if needed
    },
    'chainprecedence': {
        # Add pairs of activities where the directly-precedes relation should be imposed if needed
    },
    'chainsuccession': {
        # Add pairs of activities where both directly-follows and directly-precedes relations should be imposed if needed
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        # Add pairs of activities where the second should not occur if the first occurs if needed
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        # Add pairs of activities where the second should not follow the first if needed
    },
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        # Add pairs of activities where the second should not follow the first directly if needed
    }
}

print(declare_model)
```

This model includes the `existence` constraint for all activities, assuming they should occur at least once. The `init` constraint is set to start with "Create Fine". You can add more constraints as needed based on the specific requirements of your process model.
