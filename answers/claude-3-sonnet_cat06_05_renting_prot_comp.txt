Based on the process variants and their frequencies and performance times, there appear to be several key differences in the treatment of the protected group compared to the unprotected group:

1. Higher rejection rates: The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants ending with "Reject Prospective Tenant" (1,323 out of 2,792 or 47.4%) compared to the unprotected group (3,987 out of 6,551 or 60.8%). This suggests that the protected group faces higher rejection rates in the tenant screening process.

2. More extensive screening: The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants involving "Extensive Screening" (868 out of 2,792 or 31.1%) compared to the unprotected group (1,217 out of 6,551 or 18.6%). This indicates that the protected group is subjected to more extensive screening procedures, which could be seen as unfair treatment.

3. Longer tenancy periods: The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants involving multiple instances of "Pay Rent" (105 out of 2,792 or 3.8%) compared to the unprotected group (388 out of 6,551 or 5.9%). This suggests that the protected group, once approved, tends to have longer tenancy periods before canceling the apartment.

4. Higher eviction rates: The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants involving eviction (6 out of 2,792 or 0.2%) compared to the unprotected group (0 out of 6,551 or 0%). This indicates that the protected group faces higher eviction rates, which could be seen as unfair treatment.

5. Longer process times: For several comparable process variants (e.g., involving multiple "Pay Rent" activities), the protected group generally has higher performance times (i.e., longer process execution times) compared to the unprotected group. This could suggest delays or inefficiencies in the process for the protected group.

It's important to note that these observations are based solely on the provided data and may not capture the full context or underlying reasons for the differences. Further investigation and analysis would be necessary to understand the root causes and determine if any of these differences constitute unfair or discriminatory treatment.
