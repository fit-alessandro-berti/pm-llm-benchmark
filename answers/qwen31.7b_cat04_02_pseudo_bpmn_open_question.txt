Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to optimize the given BPMN process to reduce turnaround times and increase flexibility, especially for non-standard requests. They mentioned leveraging automation, dynamic resource allocation, and predictive analytics. 

First, I need to understand the original BPMN structure. The process starts with a start event, then has two paths based on request type (standard or custom). For standard, it goes through validation, parallel checks, and then calculates delivery date. For custom, it's feasibility analysis, then depends on whether it's feasible, leading to different paths. Then there's approval checks and generating invoices.

The main goals are to optimize time, increase flexibility, use automation, dynamic resource allocation, and predictive analytics. 

So, how to redesign each part?

Starting with the start event. Maybe add a dynamic routing based on predictive analytics to determine if a request is standard or custom. That could help in early routing decisions.

For the standard path, after completing tasks, there's a gateway to check if approval is needed. Maybe integrate automated approval checks with AI to predict if the request needs approval. But the original has a gateway that checks if approval is needed. So maybe add a predictive analytics module that forecasts approval likelihood based on historical data.

In the custom path, the feasibility check is done with an XOR gateway. Maybe add a predictive analytics module that predicts if the customization is feasible based on past data, which could reduce the need for manual checks. Also, if it's feasible, maybe automate the quotation preparation and send it, reducing manual steps.

For resource allocation, dynamic allocation might involve using AI to predict which tasks need more resources. For example, if a request is likely to be custom, allocate more resources to the feasibility analysis and quotation preparation. Maybe add a resource allocation gateway that uses predictive analytics to allocate resources based on the likelihood of the request type.

Automation could be applied to tasks like credit checks, inventory checks, and approval processes. For example, automate credit checks using AI models, reduce manual steps in approval processes. Also, use AI to predict delivery dates and generate invoices automatically.

Predictive analytics would involve using historical data to predict which requests are likely to be standard or custom. This could help in routing requests early, reducing processing time. Also, predict which requests might need customization and allocate resources accordingly.

Potential changes:

1. Add predictive analytics modules to determine request type (standard/custom) and feasibility.
2. Integrate automated checks for credit and inventory, maybe using AI models.
3. Use dynamic resource allocation gates based on predictive analytics.
4. Automate approval processes and invoice generation.
5. Add loops for custom requests with predictive analytics to determine if they need re-evaluation.

Impact on performance: faster processing times, reduced manual intervention, better resource use. Customer satisfaction might increase with faster turnaround and accurate quotes. Operational complexity could be managed by automating tasks and using predictive analytics to minimize errors.

Need to make sure each part of the BPMN is addressed, like gates, tasks, and how they interact. Also, explain how these changes affect the overall process.
