The data provided represents a process flow diagram, which outlines the various stages and transitions involved in a particular process. In this case, the process seems to involve the submission, approval, and handling of a request for payment. The process involves multiple actors, such as the employee, supervisor, administration, pre-approver, and budget owner, each with their own roles and responsibilities.

Here's a brief description of the process:

1. An employee submits a request for payment (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. The submitted request can be approved or rejected at various stages by different actors, such as the supervisor, administration, pre-approver, and budget owner.
3. If the request is approved, it moves forward to the next stage (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
4. If the request is rejected at any stage, it can be sent back to the employee for revision or resubmission (Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration REJECTED by MISSING).
5. Once the request is approved, it can be handled for payment (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled).

The frequency and performance values provided for each transition indicate the number of times the transition occurs and the average time it takes to complete the transition, respectively. These values can be used to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the process and identify potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
