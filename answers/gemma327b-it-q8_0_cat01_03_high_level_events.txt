# Proposed High-Level Activities and Justification

high_level_activities = [
    {
        "ActivityName": "Material Preparation",
        "LowLevelEvents": [
            "Retrieve raw metal sheet",
            "Scan barcode",
            "Place metal sheet on table",
            "Align metal sheet",
            "Preheat metal sheet"
        ],
        "Justification": "These events all relate to preparing the raw material for the next stage of the manufacturing process. They involve receiving the material, verifying its identity, positioning it correctly, and preparing it for welding by preheating it to the appropriate temperature. They are temporally sequential and logically connected."
    },
    {
        "ActivityName": "Welding",
        "LowLevelEvents": [
            "Pick up welding tool",
            "Weld corner A",
            "Weld corner B"
        ],
        "Justification": "These events represent the core welding process. Picking up the tool is a prerequisite for the welding actions. Welding corner A and B are sequential steps within the welding process itself. They are all performed by the same resource type (Operator B) and are directly related to joining the metal components."
    },
    {
        "ActivityName": "Quality Inspection",
        "LowLevelEvents": [
            "Measure weld integrity"
        ],
        "Justification": "This event is a direct quality check performed immediately after the welding process. It assesses the quality of the weld and provides a measurement (IntegritityScore) to determine if it meets the required standards. It's a distinct step focused on ensuring quality."
    },
    {
        "ActivityName": "Coating and Drying",
        "LowLevelEvents": [
            "Apply protective coating",
            "Dry coating"
        ],
        "Justification": "These events represent the application of a protective coating to the welded component and the subsequent drying process. They are sequential and performed by dedicated units (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2). They are essential for protecting the component from corrosion or other environmental factors."
    },
    {
        "ActivityName": "Final Inspection",
        "LowLevelEvents": [
            "Visual check"
        ],
        "Justification": "This is the final quality check performed on the completed component. It involves a visual inspection to ensure that the component meets all required standards. It's a distinct step performed by Operator C and represents the final verification before the component is considered complete."

# Output the structured representation
for activity in high_level_activities:
    print(f"Activity Name: {activity['ActivityName']}")
    print(f"Low-Level Events: {', '.join(activity['LowLevelEvents'])}")
    print(f"Justification: {activity['Justification']}")
    print("-" * 20)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`high_level_activities` List:**  This list contains dictionaries, each representing a high-level activity.

2. **`ActivityName`:**  A descriptive name for the high-level activity.

3. **`LowLevelEvents`:** A list of the low-level events that are grouped into this activity.

4. **`Justification`:**  A clear explanation of why these low-level events were grouped together, based on their logical relationship, temporal sequence, and resource usage.

5. **Output:** The code iterates through the `high_level_activities` list and prints the information for each activity in a structured format.

**Key Considerations and Improvements:**

* **Scalability:** This approach can be scaled to handle a larger event log by adding more activities and refining the grouping criteria.
* **Automation:**  The grouping process could be automated using machine learning techniques like clustering or sequence mining.  For example, you could use the timestamps and resource information to identify patterns and automatically group events.
* **Domain Expertise:**  The grouping criteria should be informed by domain expertise.  Understanding the manufacturing process is crucial for creating meaningful high-level activities.
* **Event Attributes:**  The `AdditionalInfo` attribute could be used to further refine the grouping criteria. For example, you could group events based on the `PartID` or `ToolID`.
* **Overlapping Activities:** In more complex processes, activities might overlap.  The grouping criteria should be able to handle such cases.
* **Process Variations:**  The grouping criteria should be robust enough to handle variations in the manufacturing process.  For example, some products might require additional steps or different sequences of events.
