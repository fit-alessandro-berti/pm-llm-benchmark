Okay, let me tackle this loan application process analysis. The user has provided a detailed scenario with strict rules (normative constraints) and recommended practices (desiderata), plus an event log to evaluate.

First, I need to carefully distinguish between the two types of requirements. The normative rules are absolute - any violation makes the case non-compliant. The desiderata are softer guidelines where deviations are acceptable but not ideal.

Looking at Case 1: It follows the perfect sequence. Application → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Approved Decision → Inform → Finalize Docs → Close. No normative issues. For desiderata, the timing seems reasonable (all within same day), but there's no mention of Follow-up Call. Since that's optional, it's just a minor desideratum miss.

Case 2 immediately raises red flags. The log shows Risk Assessment happening before Credit Check - that's a direct violation of the "Credit Check before Risk Assessment" rule. Then after rejection, they still did Finalize Documentation, which is explicitly forbidden. And they closed the case after that improper documentation. This case is a double normative violation.

Case 3 is interesting. The Credit Check happened 2 days after application (violating the 24h desideratum), and Inform Applicant was 2 days after decision (violating 48h recommendation). But crucially, the sequence itself is correct: all mandatory steps in order, with documentation only for approved loan. No normative violations here - just timing issues and missing Follow-up Call (which is purely optional).

Hmm... I should note that Case 3's documentation timing (after approval) is correct per normative rules, even though the inform step was delayed. The desiderata only cares about informing within 48h of decision, not documentation timing.

For justifications: In Case 2, maybe someone mistakenly thought Risk Assessment could start early, but that's not excusable per strict rules. The documentation after rejection seems like a serious error - perhaps system glitch or human mistake. Case 3's delays might be due to high workload, which explains why it's only a desideratum issue.

The user seems to want clear separation between "must-follow" and "nice-to-have" violations. I'll make sure to categorize each case's issues precisely, and emphasize that Case 2 is fundamentally broken while Case 3 is just inefficient.

Based on the provided normative constraints (Part 1) and desiderata (Part 2), here's a detailed analysis of each case:

---

### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules (Strict Violations)**  
**Case 2** violates normative rules **severely** with **two critical issues**:  
- **Violation 1: Risk Assessment before Credit Check**  
  - *Log sequence*: `Application Received` → **`Risk Assessment`** → `Credit Check`  
  - *Normative constraint violated*: **"Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment"** (explicitly required in Key Constraints).  
  - *Why it matters*: Risk Assessment *depends* on credit data; skipping this step invalidates the entire risk logic.  

- **Violation 2: Finalizing Documentation after Rejection**  
  - *Log sequence*: `Loan Decision (Rejected)` → `Finalize Documentation` → `Close Case`  
  - *Normative constraint violated*: **"If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case"** (explicitly forbidden in "What is Not Allowed").  
  - *Why it matters*: Documentation finalization is *only* permitted for **approved** loans. Performing it after rejection is wasteful and contradicts policy.  

**Conclusion for Case 2**: **Non-compliant** with normative rules. The process sequence is fundamentally broken (wrong order + prohibited action).  

**Case 1 & Case 3**: **No normative violations**.  
- Case 1 follows the exact required sequence (including documentation only for approval).  
- Case 3 follows the correct sequence (Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Decision → Inform → Documentation for approval → Close).  

---

### **2. Cases Failing Desiderata (Suboptimal but Not Severe)**  
**Case 3** fails **two desiderata**:  
- **Desideratum 1: Credit Check delay**  
  - *Log*: `Application Received` (2024-01-12 09:00) → `Credit Check` (2024-01-14 10:00)  
  - *Issue*: Credit Check took **>48 hours** (vs. recommended ≤24 hours).  
  - *Severity*: **Minor** (timing guideline only; no normative rule broken).  

- **Desideratum 2: Delayed applicant notification**  
  - *Log*: `Loan Decision (Approved)` (2024-01-14 12:00) → `Inform Applicant` (2024-01-16 15:00)  
  - *Issue*: Notification took **>48 hours** (vs. recommended ≤48 hours).  
  - *Severity*: **Minor** (timing guideline only; no normative rule broken).  

- **Additional desideratum miss**: No `Follow-up Call` before closing (explicitly noted in log).  
  - *Severity*: **Trivial** (optional "encouraged" step; skipping has no consequences).  

**Case 1**: **Meets all desiderata** (all steps completed promptly on the same day; Follow-up Call absence is irrelevant per Part 2).  
**Case 2**: Desiderata **not assessed** (normative violations take priority; timing/Follow-up Call are moot when core rules are broken).  

---

### **3. Interpretations & Justifications**  
#### **Case 2 (Normative Violations)**  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**:  
  - *Possible cause*: Staff error (e.g., misrouting the case) or system glitch.  
  - *Why unjustifiable*: Normative rules **explicitly forbid** this sequence. No flexibility exists (e.g., "must occur before" = absolute).  
- **Documentation after rejection**:  
  - *Possible cause*: Automation error (e.g., system auto-triggered documentation) or human oversight.  
  - *Why unjustifiable*: Normative rules **explicitly prohibit** this ("do not finalize documentation after rejection"). This is a critical policy breach.  
- **Verdict**: **Unacceptable deviation**; requires root-cause analysis and retraining.  

#### **Case 3 (Desiderata Failures Only)**  
- **Credit Check delay (48+ hours)**:  
  - *Justification*: High application volume or staff shortage.  
  - *Why acceptable*: Desiderata are **timing recommendations**, not rules. The sequence itself was correct (Credit Check *did* happen before Risk Assessment).  
- **Delayed notification (48+ hours)**:  
  - *Justification*: Manual review bottleneck or reliance on slow communication channels (e.g., postal mail).  
  - *Why acceptable*: No normative rule mandates timing; only "prompt" notification is *encouraged*.  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**:  
  - *Justification*: Staff prioritized efficiency over optional engagement.  
  - *Why acceptable*: Explicitly "encouraged—but not strictly required" (Part 2).  
- **Verdict**: **Suboptimal but compliant**; process improvement opportunity (e.g., automate reminders), but **no corrective action required**.  

#### **Case 1 (Fully Compliant)**  
- Ideal adherence to both normative rules and desiderata.  
- *Note*: Absence of `Follow-up Call` is **irrelevant** (desiderata violation only if performed poorly; skipping is permissible).

### **Summary Table**  
| Case | Normative Violation? | Desiderata Failure? | Severity | Action Required |  
|------|----------------------|---------------------|----------|----------------|  
| 1    | ❌ No                 | ❌ No               | None     | None           |  
| 2    | ✅ **Yes** (2 violations) | N/A               | **Critical** | **Immediate correction** (reprocess case, investigate root cause) |  
| 3    | ❌ No                 | ✅ **Yes** (2 timing + Follow-up Call) | **Low** | Process optimization (e.g., reduce delays), but **no reprocessing** |  

**Key Takeaway**:  
- Normative violations (Case 2) **invalidate the process** and require urgent remediation.  
- Desiderata failures (Case 3) reflect **inefficiency**, not non-compliance, and should be addressed through continuous improvement—not punitive measures.  
- Strict adherence to sequence/logic (Part 1) is **non-negotiable**; timing/optional steps (Part 2) are **flexible best practices**.
