This scenario describes a complex supply chain where delays between sequential steps can vary significantly based on logistical and quality control factors.

Here is a representative Python dictionary for the **Temporal Profile**, estimating reasonable average times (in seconds, assuming a standard business day/week framework) and associated standard deviations for pairs of activities that eventually follow each other within the process execution.

We must consider *all* possible pairs that could appear sequentially across *at least one* process execution, even if they are not immediately consecutive in a single perfect trace.

**Activity List:**
SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # --- Procurement Phase ---
    ('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 1800),      # Supplier Selection -> Order Placement (Relatively quick, depends on final negotiation)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (604800, 172800),  # SS -> RC (Long lead time expectation, 7 days avg + std dev)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (518400, 129600),  # Order Placement -> Receive Components (Supplier lead time: ~6 days avg)
    
    # --- Receiving and Inspection Phase ---
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),    # Receive Components -> Quality Inspection (Inspection queue/time: ~1 day avg)
    ('RC', 'CA'): (172800, 43200),   # RC -> CA (If inspection is fast or batched)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 14400),    # Quality Inspection -> Component Assembly (Post-approval queue: ~12 hours avg)
    
    # --- Assembly and Testing Phase ---
    ('CA', 'PT'): (10800, 5400),     # Component Assembly -> Product Testing (Relatively quick turnaround for testing setup)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (360000, 72000),   # CA -> PK (If multiple sub-units require testing before final packaging)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 7200),     # Product Testing -> Packaging (Final sign-off process time)
    
    # --- Packaging and Storage Phase ---
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800),      # Packaging -> Warehouse Storage Entry (Immediate storage placement)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (172800, 518400),  # PK -> DT (Packaging -> Distribution: Major variance due to shipment scheduling)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),   # Warehouse Storage -> Distribution (Time spent waiting for optimal truck/shipment slot: ~3 days avg)

    # --- Distribution and Post-Sale ---
    ('DT', 'AS'): (1209600, 604800), # Distribution -> After-Sales Support (Time until customer activation/first contact: ~2 weeks avg)
    
    # --- Cross-Phase Pairs (Illustrating potential separation) ---
    ('SS', 'PT'): (691200, 259200),  # Supplier Selection -> Product Testing (Long sequence covering procurement and manufacturing)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (432000, 108000),  # Quality Inspection -> Packaging (Time spanning assembly and testing)
    ('OP', 'WS'): (777600, 259200),  # Order Placement -> Warehouse Storage (Total time until product is ready to ship)
