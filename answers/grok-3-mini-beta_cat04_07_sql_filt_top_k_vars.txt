First, the prompt involves an event log in a DuckDB table called `event_log` with columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. I need to work with sequences of activities per case, ordered by timestamp.

A process variant is the ordered sequence of activities for a single case. So, for each `case_id`, I have to get the activities in the order they happened based on `timestamp`.

Then, I need to:

1. Get the sequence for each case.

2. Group cases by their sequences to find unique variants.

3. Count how many cases have each variant.

4. Identify the top K variants by frequency.

5. Finally, return all events from the cases that are part of these top K variants.

The query should output the events from only those cases in the top K variants.

How do I handle sequences in SQL? Sequences are ordered lists, but SQL isn't great with arrays natively, especially in aggregations. DuckDB supports arrays and string aggregation, so I can probably concatenate the activities into a string to represent the sequence.

For example, for a case, if the activities in order are A, B, C, I can make a string like 'A,B,C' as the variant identifier.

Steps in the query:

1. First, for each case_id, get the ordered list of activities.

I can do this by selecting from event_log, grouping by case_id, and using an array_agg or string_agg on the activity, ordered by timestamp.

Something like:

SELECT 

    case_id,

    STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant

FROM event_log

GROUP BY case_id;

That gives me a table with case_id and its variant string.

2. Now, with that, I need to group by the variant and count the number of case_ids per variant.

So, I can wrap that in another query:

SELECT 

    variant,

    COUNT(case_id) AS frequency

FROM (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

) sub

GROUP BY variant

ORDER BY frequency DESC

LIMIT K;  // Wait, no, I need the top K, but then use them to filter.

I need to get the top K variants first, then use those to filter the original events.

In SQL, to get the top K and then join back, I might need a subquery or CTE.

The prompt doesn't specify what K is; I assume it's a parameter, like a variable.

In the query, I need to use it, so probably something like :K or just assume it's given.

For now, I'll think of it as a parameter.

So, first, get the variants with their frequencies, ordered by frequency descending, and take the top K.

Then, for those top K variants, get the case_ids that have those variants.

Finally, select from the original event_log where case_id is in those case_ids.

Yes.

Let me outline the query structure.

Use a CTE for clarity.

WITH ordered_sequences AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT 

        variant,

        COUNT(case_id) AS frequency,

        ARRAY_AGG(case_id) AS case_ids  -- Maybe collect the case_ids here for later use

    FROM ordered_sequences

    GROUP BY variant

),

top_k_variants AS (

    SELECT 

        variant,

        frequency,

        case_ids

    FROM variant_counts

    ORDER BY frequency DESC

    LIMIT :K  -- Assuming :K is the parameter

)

Now, from top_k_variants, I have the variants and their case_ids.

Then, to get the events, I need to select from event_log where case_id is in the case_ids of top_k_variants.

Since case_ids is an array, I can use UNNEST or something, but in the WHERE clause, I might need to use IN with unnested array.

In DuckDB, I can do something like:

SELECT * FROM event_log

WHERE case_id IN (SELECT UNNEST(case_ids) FROM top_k_variants)

That should work.

top_k_variants has multiple rows, each with its own case_ids array, so SELECT UNNEST(case_ids) FROM top_k_variants will give all case_ids from the top K variants.

Yes!

So, the final query would be:

WITH ...

SELECT * FROM event_log

WHERE case_id IN (

    SELECT UNNEST(case_ids) FROM top_k_variants

)

In my CTE, I have top_k_variants with case_ids as an array per variant.

Yes.

If I don't want to aggregate case_ids in variant_counts, I could join back.

But this way is efficient.

In variant_counts, I'm already grouping by variant and can aggregate case_ids.

Yes.

One potential issue: if two variants have the same case_id, but that shouldn't happen since each case_id has one variant.

Each case_id has only one variant, so in variant_counts, ARRAY_AGG(case_id) will just collect the case_ids for that variant.

Perfect.

Finally, output all events from those case_ids.

The prompt says: "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So, yes, select * from event_log where case_id in the selected ones.

I should probably order it or something, but the prompt doesn't specify, so just return them as is.

One more thing: in the sequence, are there duplicates or variations? For example, if a case has multiple instances of the same activity, STRING_AGG will include them, like 'A,B,A' if that happens.

I think that's fine, as it's the exact sequence.

Also, assuming timestamps are unique per case or at least, the order is correctly determined.

If two events have the same timestamp, the order might be arbitrary, but we'll assume it's fine.

Alright, so putting it all together.

The prompt says "determine the top K variants by their frequency" and then "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

I think that's what I have.

One last: in the final output, should I include all columns? Yes, "Return all events", so SELECT * from event_log for those cases.

Probably, it might be good to order by case_id and timestamp, but not specified.

I think this is good.

Below is the complete DuckDB SQL query that addresses the requirements outlined in the prompt. This query:

1. Extracts the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id` by sorting events by `timestamp`.
2. Groups cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants.
3. Counts the number of cases per variant and identifies the top K variants by frequency.
4. Filters the original event log to return only the events from cases that belong to these top K variants.

### Key Assumptions:
- `K` is a parameter that represents the number of top variants to consider (e.g., you can pass it as `:K` in your DuckDB query).
- Activities are concatenated into a string (e.g., 'A,B,C') to represent the sequence. This is a common approach in SQL for handling ordered sequences, as it allows easy grouping and comparison.
- If two events in the same case have the same timestamp, their order in the sequence is determined by the database's sorting behavior (e.g., based on the order they appear in the table).
- The query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for clarity and modularity.

### DuckDB SQL Query:

```sql
-- Step 1: Extract the ordered sequence of activities for each case_id
WITH ordered_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant  -- Concatenate activities in timestamp order
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),

-- Step 2: Group by variant and count the frequency of each variant
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(case_id) AS frequency,  -- Count the number of cases for each variant
        ARRAY_AGG(case_id) AS case_ids  -- Collect case_ids for each variant (for later filtering)
    FROM ordered_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),

-- Step 3: Identify the top K variants by frequency
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        frequency,
        case_ids
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY frequency DESC  -- Sort by frequency in descending order
    LIMIT :K  -- Limit to the top K variants (replace :K with the actual value, e.g., 5)
)

-- Step 4: Return all events from the original event log for cases in the top K variants
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    event_log
WHERE 
    case_id IN (  -- Filter to only cases in the top K variants
        SELECT UNNEST(case_ids)  -- Unnest the array of case_ids from top K variants
        FROM top_k_variants
    )
ORDER BY 
    case_id, timestamp;  -- Optional: Order the output for readability (by case and timestamp)
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **ordered_sequences CTE**:
   - Groups the events by `case_id`.
   - Uses `STRING_AGG` to aggregate activities into a single string, ordered by `timestamp`. This string represents the process variant (e.g., 'A,B,C').

2. **variant_counts CTE**:
   - Groups the results from `ordered_sequences` by the `variant` string.
   - Counts the frequency of each variant (i.e., how many cases share that sequence).
   - Uses `ARRAY_AGG` to collect all `case_id`s for each variant. This will be used later to filter the original events.

3. **top_k_variants CTE**:
   - Selects from `variant_counts` and orders by `frequency` in descending order.
   - Limits the results to the top K variants using `LIMIT :K`. Here, `:K` is a placeholder for a parameter (e.g., in DuckDB, you can prepare the query with a parameter).

4. **Main Query**:
   - Selects all columns (`*`) from the original `event_log` table.
   - Filters rows to include only those where the `case_id` is in the list of case_ids from the top K variants. This is done using a subquery with `UNNEST` to expand the array of case_ids.
   - The final `ORDER BY` clause ensures the output is sorted by `case_id` and `timestamp` for better readability, though this is not explicitly required by the prompt.

### How to Execute:
- Replace `:K` with an actual integer value (e.g., 5) when running the query.
- Example: If you want the top 3 variants, use `LIMIT 3`.
- Ensure your DuckDB environment is set up with the `event_log` table.

This query is efficient and leverages DuckDB's support for arrays and string aggregation. It correctly handles the requirements while excluding events from cases not in the top K variants. If you have any additional constraints (e.g., handling ties in frequency), let me know for further refinements!
