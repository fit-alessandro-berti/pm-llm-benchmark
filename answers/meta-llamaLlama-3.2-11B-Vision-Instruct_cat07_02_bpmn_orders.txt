The provided visualization is a flowchart that outlines the process of ordering materials and managing inventory within a company. It consists of four main sections: Sales, Production, Document, and Warehouse.

**Sales Section:**

*   **Order Details:** The sales section begins with order details, which include the customer's order number, the product being ordered, and the quantity required.
*   **Check Customer's Order:** The next step is to check if the customer's order is already in the database. If it is, the order is added to the database and the customer is notified.
*   **Add Customer to Database:** If the customer is not already in the database, they are added to the database and their order is processed.
*   **Send Order Details:** The order details are sent to the production department for processing.

**Production Section:**

*   **Plan Production:** The production section begins with planning production, which involves determining the quantity of each product that needs to be produced.
*   **Manufacture Product:** Once the production plan is finalized, the product is manufactured according to the specifications provided.
*   **Product Complete:** After manufacturing is complete, the product is marked as complete and ready for shipping.

**Document Section:**

*   **Order Materials:** The document section begins with ordering materials, which involves sending a request to the warehouse for the necessary materials.
*   **Return Material:** If any materials are returned, they are checked and returned to the warehouse if they are faulty.

**Warehouse Section:**

*   **Send Product:** The warehouse section begins with sending the product to the customer. The product is packaged and shipped according to the customer's specifications.
*   **Product Sent:** Once the product has been shipped, it is marked as sent and the order is considered complete.

In summary, the flowchart provides a clear overview of the material compensation subprocess, from receiving customer orders to shipping the final product. It highlights the importance of accurate order management, efficient production planning, and timely material procurement to ensure successful product delivery.
