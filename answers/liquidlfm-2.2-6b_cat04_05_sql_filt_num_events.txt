```sql
WITH 
event_counts AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6  -- Filter groups to those with 6 or fewer events first
),
valid_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_counts
    WHERE event_count <= 6
),
filtered_events AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_cases)
)
-- This returns all events from cases that have six or fewer events

-- OR, a consolidated version using CTEs to combine filtering in one step:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN event_counts ec ON e.case_id = ec.case_id
WHERE ec.case_id IN (
    SELECT ec_case_id
    FROM (VALUES (case_id) AS ec_case_id FOR i IN 1..N(max(event_counts).*)) -- This is a placeholder; coefficients or actual SQL handling of variable worst-case need to be accounted for
    WHERE ec_case_id.event_count <= 6
)
AND ec_case_id.event_count <= 6
-- But a more idiomatic approach after existing 'HAVING' filter in our CTE:

-- Revisiting the more robust method:
WITH event_counts AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
reduced_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_counts
    WHERE event_count <= 6  -- Only reduce to cases with  6 entries
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM reduced_cases)

-- Alternatively, iterating again after building the partitioned chain:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN event_counts ec ON e.case_id = ec.case_id
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id AS case_id_sub,
           COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY event_count
    HAVING event_count <= 6
) reduced ON ec.case_id = reduced.case_id_sub
LIMIT 6  -- Not necessary here, since we need to preserve original event flow but can't join properly, so:

-- Final, correct and concise solution using CTEs to eliminate over-count cases:

WITH event_totals AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
valid_case_ids AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_totals
    WHERE event_count <= 6
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_case_ids)

But that iterates over last, so to maintain correctness:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT c1.case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT case_id
        FROM event_counts
        WHERE event_count <= 6
    ) ec
)
ORDER BY ec.event_count

-- However, the most correct way is to filter in stages:

-- Build filter CTE first, then select from filtered cases with their full event log:

-- Final Answer, optimal and clear:

WITH valid_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_cases);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify over-sized cases first:**  
   Use a CTE `event_totals` to count events per `case_id`, then filter these counts to keep only cases with 6 or fewer events (`valid_cases`).

2. **Select surviving cases and their events:**  
   Return all rows from `event_log` where `case_id` is in `valid_cases`, thus excluding cases with >6 events.

This query **avoids unnecessary joins or subqueries** and directly filters based on case sizes, ensuring correctness. The zero-count correlation is implicitly handled by the `HAVING` and deduplication via `GROUP BY`.  

(Note: Some platform constraints may limit grouping variables using recursive/unlimited COUNT; this assumes DuckDB supports direct post-HAVING filtering via `e.***` with `GROUP BY`.)
