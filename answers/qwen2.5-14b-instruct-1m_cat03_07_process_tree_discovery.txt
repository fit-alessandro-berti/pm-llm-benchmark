To capture the observed behavior of the event log and balance fitness, precision, and simplicity, the process tree should reflect the main sequence of activities, the optional nature of the loop for requesting missing information and re-validation, and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival steps.

Here's the process tree structure:

```plaintext
+ (  -> ( 'Receive Application (RA)',  -> ( 'Validate Form (VF)',  -> ( 'Assess Eligibility (AE)',  * (  -> ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)' ),  -> ( 'Approval Decision (AD)',  -> ( 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 'Archive Case (AC)' ) ) ) ) ) )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main Sequence (`->`)**:
   - **Receive Application (RA)**
     - This is the starting activity for each case.
   - **Validate Form (VF)**
     - After receiving the application, the form is validated.
   - **Assess Eligibility (AE)**
     - The eligibility is assessed next.

2. **Optional Loop (`*`)**:
   - **Request Missing Info (RMI)**
     - If missing information is required, this activity is performed.
   - **Validate Form (VF)**
     - The form is re-validated after missing information is provided.
   - This loop can occur multiple times until no more missing information is required.

3. **Approval and Archival (`->`)**:
   - **Approval Decision (AD)**
     - The approval decision is made after the loop is exited.
   - **Send Confirmation (SC)**
     - A confirmation is sent once approved.
   - **Archive Case (AC)**
     - The case is finally archived.

4. **True Concurrency (`+`)**:
   - The main sequence and the optional loop can occur in true concurrency. The loop is optional and may not occur in all executions, but when it does, it can happen multiple times in parallel with the main sequence.

This process tree effectively captures the variability and optional nature of the loop while maintaining the main flow of the process, ensuring both fitness and precision.
