Here's a DuckDB SQL query that solves this benchmark:

```sql
SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inner query**: 
   - Groups all events by `case_id`
   - Uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to filter for cases with 6 or fewer events
   - Returns only the `case_id` values that meet this criterion

2. **Outer query**:
   - Uses `WHERE case_id IN (...)` to filter the original event log
   - Returns all events (including all original columns) for only those cases identified in the inner query
   - Orders results by `case_id` and `timestamp` for logical process flow

**Alternative approach using window functions:**

```sql
SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
FROM (
    SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) as case_event_count
    FROM event_log
)
WHERE case_event_count <= 6
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

Both queries will produce the same result, but the first approach with a subquery is often more readable and may perform better in DuckDB for this specific use case.
