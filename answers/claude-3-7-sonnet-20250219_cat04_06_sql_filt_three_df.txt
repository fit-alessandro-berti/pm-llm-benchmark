# DuckDB SQL Query for Event Log Filtering

I'll solve this step by step, creating a query that identifies and excludes cases with the specific sequence pattern and timing condition.

```sql
WITH 
-- Step 1: Find events with the three activities we're looking for
relevant_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp
    FROM 
        event_log
    WHERE 
        activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
),

-- Step 2: Find the sequence of activities within each case
sequence_detection AS (
    SELECT
        r1.case_id,
        r1.timestamp AS approve_timestamp,
        r2.timestamp AS create_timestamp,
        r3.timestamp AS confirm_timestamp
    FROM
        relevant_activities r1
    JOIN
        relevant_activities r2
        ON r1.case_id = r2.case_id
        AND r1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND r2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND r2.timestamp > r1.timestamp
        -- Ensure no other relevant activity between Approve and Create
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM relevant_activities rx
            WHERE rx.case_id = r1.case_id
              AND rx.timestamp > r1.timestamp
              AND rx.timestamp < r2.timestamp
        )
    JOIN
        relevant_activities r3
        ON r2.case_id = r3.case_id
        AND r3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND r3.timestamp > r2.timestamp
        -- Ensure no other relevant activity between Create and Confirm
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM relevant_activities ry
            WHERE ry.case_id = r2.case_id
              AND ry.timestamp > r2.timestamp
              AND ry.timestamp < r3.timestamp
        )
),

-- Step 3: Identify cases with the sequence and where time between Create and Confirm is > 5 days
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM
        sequence_detection
    WHERE
        DATEDIFF('day', create_timestamp, confirm_timestamp) > 5
)

-- Step 4: Return all events except those from the identified cases
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

## Explanation:

1. **relevant_activities CTE**: First, I filter the event log to only include the three activities we're interested in, which makes subsequent processing more efficient.

2. **sequence_detection CTE**: This identifies cases with the three activities in the exact sequence specified, with no other relevant activities in between. The `NOT EXISTS` subqueries ensure that there are no other events from our relevant activities between each pair in the sequence.

3. **cases_to_exclude CTE**: From the cases with the correct sequence, I further filter to only those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days using `DATEDIFF`.

4. **Final query**: Returns all events from the original event log except those belonging to cases identified in the previous step.

This query correctly identifies and excludes cases with the specific three-activity sequence where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days, returning all events from the remaining cases.
