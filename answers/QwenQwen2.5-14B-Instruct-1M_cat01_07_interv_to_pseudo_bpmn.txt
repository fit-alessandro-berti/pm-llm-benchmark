7. **Resolve Discrepancies**  **Send to Manager for Approval**
8. **Send to Manager for Approval**  **Manager Approval**
9. **Manager Approval**  **Schedule Payment**

#### **Gateways/Decision Points:**
1. **Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO):**  
   - Decision: If PO is missing, send back to supplier; if valid, log the invoice.
2. **Resolve Discrepancies:**  
   - Decision: If discrepancies can be resolved, proceed to send to Manager for Approval. If not, escalate to Supervisor.
3. **Manager Approval:**  
   - Decision: Approve or reject the invoice.

#### **Roles/Participants:**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):**  
  - Checks PO validity, logs invoices, forwards to Purchasing, matches invoices, resolves discrepancies, schedules payment.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan):**  
  - Confirms receipt of goods/services, checks invoice details against PO.
- **Department Manager (Carlos):**  
  - Approves the invoice.
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita):**  
  - Escalates and resolves complex or exceptional cases.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):**  
  - Assists in resolving discrepancies with suppliers.

#### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
- **Inputs:** Invoice, Purchase Order (PO)
- **Outputs:** Confirmed and approved invoice, Payment schedule
- **Artifacts:** Email notifications, Corrected invoices, Retrospective PO

#### **Exceptions/Variations:**
- **Missing PO:** Invoice is sent back to supplier for details; escalation to Supplier Relationship Manager if needed.
- **Discrepancies in Invoice:** Escalation to Supervisor for resolution; possible rejection by Manager if discrepancies can't be resolved.
- **Non-Matching Invoices:** Invoices that do not match any PO are handled by Supervisor to create retrospective POs or reject invoices.
- **Supplier Issues:** Supplier Relationship Manager involved to assist with supplier communication and resolution.

### Notes on Uncertainty and Ambiguity:
- **Escalation Path:** In some cases, discrepancies are resolved by Mary, while in others, Rita intervenes. The model assumes that Rita will be involved if the discrepancies cannot be resolved easily.
- **Manager Notification:** The manager is notified automatically after receipt confirmation and PO matching.
- **Payment Scheduling:** After approval, the invoice is scheduled for payment by the Accounts Payable Clerk.

This structured textual representation provides a clear and logical flow of the invoice approval process, capturing all key activities, participants, decision points, and exceptions noted in the interviews.
