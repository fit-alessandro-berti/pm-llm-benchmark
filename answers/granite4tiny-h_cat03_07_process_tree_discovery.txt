Based on the event log provided, the following process tree captures the observed behavior:

```plaintext
+ ( 'RA', 
     + ( 
         -> ( 'VF', 'AE', 
              * ( 'RMI', 'VF', 'AE' ),  // Optional loop for missing information and re-validation
              'AD', 
              'SC', 
              'AC'
        )
     )
)
```

This process tree includes:
- The main sequence of activities: Receive Application ('RA'), Validate Form ('VF'), Assess Eligibility ('AE'), Request Missing Info ('RMI') with a loop for repeated missing information and re-validation, Approval Decision ('AD'), Send Confirmation ('SC'), and Archive Case ('AC').
- Optional repetition of the loop involving 'Request Missing Info', 'Validate Form', and 'Assess Eligibility' to reflect potential back-and-forth activities before proceeding.
