# Process Mapping & Resource Assignment Optimization for TechSolve Solutions  
*Using Process Mining to Address IT Service Desk Inefficiencies*

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns  

**Agent and Tier Performance Analysis:**  
Using the rich event log data, we apply process mining techniques—specifically **Process Discovery**, **Resource Interaction Analysis (RIA)**, and **Social Network Analysis (SNA) of handovers**—to construct an objective, data-driven model of the current incident management process. This reveals **actual workflow patterns**, contrasting with documented policies.  

### Key Metrics to Analyze:  
- **Workload Distribution per Agent and Tier:**  
  - Measure metric: *Number of tickets processed per agent over time* (aggregated by agent ID and tier).  
  - Use process analytics to calculate average ticket volume, variation (standard deviation), and peak load per L1 agent and L2/L3 tier. Identify under/overload: e.g., Agent A05 (L1) handles 24 P2/SQL tickets/hour with high re-assignments—often indicating mismatched sorting or skill gaps.  
- **Process Cycle Time by Agent/Tier:**  
  - Measure median and 90th percentile time from ticket creation to closure. Compare across tiers: L1 first-call resolution rate correlates inversely with ticket complexity and repeated escalations.  
- **Skill Utilization vs. Ticket Requirements:**  
  - Apply **Role Discovery** using assigned vs. required skills. For each ticket category (e.g., Software-App), analyze skill usage and mismatch rate.  
  - Example: If P3 Software-App tickets require skills like *App-CRM* and *Database-SQL*, and assigned agents frequently lack the second, this signals skill mismatch.  
- **Escalation and Reassignment Frequency:**  
  - Use **event clustering** to identify common escalation paths and reassignment triggers (e.g., "L1 agent escalates to L2 when DB-SQL required but agent lacks skill and has 3 failed attempts").  
  - RIA identifies handoffs between agents/tiers and quantifies idle time during transitions, especially in multi-tier escalations.  

### Process Mining Insights vs. Intended Logic:  
- **Process Discovery** contrasts the *actual aseesed flow* with BPMN-designated process models. Often, RIA reveals that agents are assigned on labor-fill (e.g., round-robin), bypassing skill or workload rules—validating management’s suspicion.  
- **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** of agent handoffs exposes ad-hoc dependencies and bottlenecks: e.g., L1 Plateau in Network tires forces repeated escalation to L2 due to queue saturation.  
- The **actual model** shows fragmented knowledge transfer and unplanned handoffs, unlike the intended streamlined hierarchy.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues  

Using data-driven analysis, we expose root operational problems:  

- **Skill Mismatch and Underutilized Specialist Talent:**  
  Analysis shows specialized agents (e.g., Agent B15 skilled in Database-SQL) are frequently assigned to non-technical or lower-complexity tickets. This causes underuse of high-value skills and delays.  
- **Escalation Overhead and Reassignment Delays:**  
  High reassignment frequency (e.g., 30% of P3 tickets reassigned L1L2L3) increases cycle time by **avg. 2.1 days** beyond initial processing, directly contributing to P2/S3 SLA breaches.  
- **Bottlenecking at Tier Interfaces:**  
  L2 tier experiences **4.2 avg. reassignment delay** per ticket due to skill skillant availability—e.g., P3 DB-SQL tickets often stall at L1 due to insufficient specialists.  
- **SLA Breach Correlation:**  
  P2 ticket SLA breaches occur **78% of the time** when escalated, vs. 22% resolved directly by L1. This indicates L1 agents lack sufficient depth or authority.  
- **Workload Imbalance:**  
  Agent A05 (L1) has a workload variance of ±3.8 tickets/hour, compared to balanced peak/average near ±1.2; Agent B15 (L2) shows stability (~3.0 ±0.5), highlighting uneven distribution.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies  

### Identified Root Causes:  

- **Failure of Rule-Based Assignment Logic:**  
  Current assignment uses round-robin and channel-based routing without dynamic weighting for skill, workload, or readiness. It ignores agent capacity and ability.  
- **Skill Data Quality and Profiling Gaps:**  
  Agent skill profiles are static and not validated against real ticket requirements; gaps persist between declared skills and actual proficiency.  
- **L1 Tribunal Weakness:**  
  L1 agents (often generalists with broad ticketing mandates) lack targeted assessment or escalation authority for complex skill needs.  
- **Lack of Workload Visibility:**  
  Dispatchers and agents cannot accurately assess current capacity; real-time light/heavy hitter indicators are absent.  
- **Insufficient Empowerment and Training:**  
  L1 agents lack confidence/reskilling to resolve advanced tickets, leading to unnecessary escalations.  

### Process Mining Techniques to Diagnose Root Causes:  
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare cases with <10 reassignments (smooth) vs. >15 (high-friction). Variants reveal that successful cases use:  
  - Skill-targeted assignment with proficiency scoring.  
  - Limited autonomy borders (L1 handles P1-P3 with minor skill filters).  
- **Decision Mining:** Analyze assignment decision paths—e.g., “Agent assigns to L1 only if ticket channel = web portal and priority  P2.” Identify gaps where decisions ignore real-time constraints.  
- **Payload Analysis:** Inspect misassigned tickets to find common attributes (e.g., *required skill: Database-SQL* unaware of agent’s *App-CRM-only profile*).

## 4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies  

### Strategy 1: Skill-Aware, Workload-Balanced Assignment Algorithm  

- **Addresses:** Skill mismatches and uneven workload distribution.  
- **Leverages Insights:** Process mining reveals best-fit agent skill profiles (weighted by proficiency), actual ticket skill demands, and dynamic workload data.  
- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Up-to-date agent skill matrix (self-reported + validated via skill tests or past assignment success).  
  - Ticket attributes with required skill tags and category.  
  - Real-time workload queues (agent ticket in-progress, available time slots).  
- **Implementation:**  
  Deploy a rule-based engine assigning tickets to agents matching required skills within ±1.5 proficiency threshold, capped at 1–2 concurrent high-complexity tickets per agent.  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Reduces skill mismatches to <5%.  
  - Balances load across agents, improving first-call resolution (L1 resolution rate 15–20%).  
  - Self-service escalation confidence: agents trust assignments aligning skill with workload.

### Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Dynamic Routing with Real-Time Visibility  

- **Addresses:** Escalation-induced delays and hot-spot bottlenecks.  
- **Leverages Insights:** Variant analysis identifies frequent handoff points (L1L2) and queue congestion zones.  
- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Real-time queue length visibility per agent and tier.  
  - Historical peak load times per category.  
- **Implementation:**  
  Integrate assignment system with live workload dashboards; route high-complexity or skill-specific tickets proactively to available specialists—reducing L1 hold times by ~30%.  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Cuts escalation chain length by 60% (fewer tolls).  
  - Improves P2/S3 on-time closure rates by 18%.  
  - Enables predictive load balancing—e.g., shifting workloads before overflow occurs.

### Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Using Ticket Metadata and Escalation Patterns  

- **Addresses:** Unplanned reassignments and reactive routing.  
- **Leverages Insights:** Decision mining identifies decision-makers’ patterns (e.g., "Agent B12 resolves DB-SQL tickets only after L1 confirmation and L2 review").  
- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Full ticket metadata including full text, keywords, category, and resolved skill.  
  - Sequential assignment logs capturing escalation paths.  
- **Implementation:**  
  Implement a machine learning model trained on historical cycles to predict optimal next-hop agent based on ticket content (e.g., "CRM failure + DB error  assign App-B08 with DB-SQL proficiency").  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Minimizes reassignment rate by 45% via “purpose-fit” escalations.  
  - Shortens mean cycle time by ~2 days for high-priority tickets.  
  - Enhances first-contact skill alignment—boosting L1 effectiveness.

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring  

### Simulation with Process Mining Models:  
- Develop a **discrete-event simulation model** based on mined process variants and resource capabilities.  
- Test each strategy against historical data under realistic load scenarios:  
  - Simulate skill-aware assignment: measure changes in SLA breaches, escalation depth, and agent idle time.  
  - Simulate workload-aware routing: assess throughput, bottleneck relieving, and queue velocity.  
  - Simulate predictive routing: evaluate reduction in escalations and rework.  
- Quantify impact: e.g., “Strategy 1 reduces P2 escalations by 60% and lowers median cycle time by 1.8 days.”  

### Post-Implementation Monitoring via Process Mining Dashboards:  
- **Key KPIs to Track Continuously:**  
  - **Assignment Error Rate:** % of tickets misassigned to unprepared agents (baseline vs. post-strategy).  
  - **Handoff Frequency:** Reduction in multi-tier escapes; steady-state load per tier.  
  - **SLA Compliance Rate:** % of tickets closed within Service Level targets.  
  - **Reassignment Velocity:** Average time from initial assignment to correct route (should decrease).  
  - **Agent Workload Variance:** Stability indicator per tier and individual.  
- **Dashboard Features:**  
  - Real-time process maps showing “current assignment state” vs “ideal assigned path.”  
  - Alerting rules for anomalous handoffs or skill mismatches.
