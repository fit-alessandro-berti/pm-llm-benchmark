## **Analysis of Insurance Claims Processing Event Log**

### **1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Durations**

To identify cases with significantly longer durations, we first calculate the **total duration** of each case — i.e., the time from the first event (`Submit Claim`) to the last event (`Close Claim`).

#### **Step 1: Calculate Case Durations**

We will compute the duration for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time           | End Time             | Duration (hours) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30     | **1.5**          |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00     | **29.92** (~30 hrs) |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30     | **50.33** (~50 hrs) |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45     | **1.58** (~1.6 hrs) |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30     | **69.08** (~69 hrs) |

#### **Step 2: Determine Threshold for “Significantly Longer”**

- The **median duration** is approximately **~2 hours**.
- Cases that exceed **24 hours** can be considered **significantly longer**.

#### **Cases with Performance Issues:**
- **Case 2002** – 29.92 hours
- **Case 2003** – 50.33 hours
- **Case 2005** – 69.08 hours

These three cases are **clear outliers** in terms of duration.

### **2. Analyze Attributes: Resource, Region, Complexity**

Let’s examine the **attributes** for the problematic cases and see if there are **patterns**.

#### **Attribute Summary of Problematic Cases**

| Case ID | Region | Complexity | Key Resources Involved                         | Notes                                                                 |
|---------|--------|------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2002    | B      | Medium     | Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Ann, Finance_Carl       | One “Request Additional Documents” after Evaluate Claim               |
| 2003    | A      | High       | Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Bill, Finance_Alan      | **Two** “Request Additional Documents” events                         |
| 2005    | B      | High       | Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Bill, Finance_Carl      | **Three** “Request Additional Documents” events; longest duration     |

#### **Observations by Attribute**

##### **A. Complexity**
- **High complexity cases (2003, 2005)** are the **most prolonged**.
- These cases involve **multiple requests for additional documents**, which **directly correlates with increased duration**.
- **Medium complexity (2002)** also causes delay, but **less severe** than high complexity.

**Insight:**  
> **Complexity is a strong predictor of longer processing times.** Higher complexity leads to more back-and-forth with customers, requiring additional documentation.

##### **B. Region**
- **Region B** hosts **all three problematic cases** (2002, 2005) and also includes **Case 2004**, which is fast.
- However, **Region B** appears to handle **more complex cases** (2002: Medium, 2005: High), while **Region A** handles a mix (2001: Low, 2003: High).

**Insight:**  
> While **Region B** has slower cases, the **root cause isn’t the region itself**, but rather the **type of cases assigned to it**. It may be that **Region B is assigned more complex cases**, or that **its resources are less experienced** with complex claims.

##### **C. Resource**
Let’s look at the **Adjusters**, since they are involved in evaluation and requesting documents — a key bottleneck.

- **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B)**:
  - Involved in **2002 (Medium)**, **2004 (Low)**, and **2005 (High)**.
  - Handles **High complexity case (2005)** with **3 document requests** — contributed heavily to delay.
  - Also handles **Medium complexity (2002)** with **1 document request**.

- **Adjuster_Mike (Region A)**:
  - Involved in **2001 (Low)** — fast.
  - Involved in **2003 (High)** — **2 document requests**, contributed to long duration.

**Insight:**  
> **Adjuster_Lisa** appears to be handling **more complex cases** and **issuing more document requests**, contributing to delays.  
> **Adjuster_Mike** also contributes to delays in high-complexity cases, but **fewer document requests**.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis and Mitigation Suggestions**

#### **Root Causes Identified**

1. **High Complexity Claims**  
   - These cases **require multiple rounds of document requests**, significantly extending processing time.
   - Complexity leads to **unclear or incomplete initial submissions**, forcing the insurer to ask for clarifications.

2. **Inefficient Handling of Document Requests**  
   - Some resources (e.g., **Adjuster_Lisa**) issue **multiple requests** in succession, possibly due to:
     - Inadequate initial assessment.
     - Lack of clarity in communication with the claimant.
     - Poorly defined escalation criteria.

3. **Potential Resource Allocation Bias**  
   - **Region B** seems to be assigned **more complex claims**, possibly due to workload distribution or historical assignment patterns.
   - This may reflect **imbalanced workload** or **lack of specialized support** in Region B for complex claims.

---

### **Mitigation Strategies**

#### **A. Improve Front-End Claim Submission**
- **Guidance for Claimants:**  
  Provide clearer submission guidelines and checklists, especially for **high-complexity claims** (e.g., liability, fraud suspicion, large payouts).
  
- **Digital Submission Portal with Validation:**  
  Implement a system that **flags incomplete or ambiguous fields** during submission, reducing the need for later requests.

#### **B. Optimize Document Request Process**
- **Training for Adjusters:**  
  Train adjusters to **identify missing documents upfront** and **request them all at once** when possible.

- **Standardized Request Templates:**  
  Use templates that **list all required documents** for each claim type, reducing back-and-forth.

- **Escalation Protocols:**  
  Define clear thresholds for when a claim should be **escalated to a senior adjuster or specialist**, especially for high-complexity cases.

#### **C. Resource Allocation and Specialization**
- **Specialized Adjusters for Complex Claims:**  
  Assign **experienced adjusters** to high-complexity cases to **reduce evaluation time and document request cycles**.

- **Balanced Workload Across Regions:**  
  Review assignment logic to **avoid overburdening Region B** with complex claims unless it has the right expertise.

- **Performance Monitoring by Resource:**  
  Track **adjuster-level KPIs** (e.g., average time per activity, number of document requests) to **identify and address bottlenecks**.

#### **D. Process Automation**
- **Automated Document Matching:**  
  Use AI to **match submitted documents** against required fields, reducing manual review.

- **Workflow Routing Rules:**  
  Implement rules that **automatically route** claims with certain keywords or values to the appropriate specialist.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **primary root cause** of long claim durations is **claim complexity**, which leads to **multiple document requests** and delays across the process. While **Region B** appears to have the most problematic cases, this is likely due to **assignment patterns** rather than the region itself. **Adjusters**, especially **Adjuster_Lisa**, play a key role in prolonging cases through repeated document requests.

To improve performance:
- **Reduce complexity-related delays** by improving upfront claim submission.
- **Streamline document request processes**.
- **Allocate resources more strategically**, favoring experienced personnel for complex claims.

By addressing these root causes, the insurance claims process can become **faster, more predictable, and more customer-friendly**.
