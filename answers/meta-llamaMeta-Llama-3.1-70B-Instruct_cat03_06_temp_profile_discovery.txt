Here is a Python code snippet to generate a temporal profile from the provided process variants:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

# Define the process variants
variants = [
    "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection ( frequency = 56482  performance = 59591524.946 )",
    "Create Fine -> Payment ( frequency = 46371  performance = 889688.400 )",
    "Create Fine -> Send Fine ( frequency = 20385  performance = 8380516.026 )",
    #... rest of the variants
]

# Regular expression to extract the activities and performance from each variant
pattern = re.compile(r"Create Fine -> (.*) \( frequency = \d+  performance = (\d+\.\d+) \)")

# Dictionary to store the temporal profile
temporal_profile = defaultdict(list)

# Iterate over the variants and extract the activities and performance
for variant in variants:
    match = pattern.match(variant)
    if match:
        activities = match.group(1).split(" -> ")
        performance = float(match.group(2))
        for i in range(len(activities) - 1):
            activity_pair = (activities[i], activities[i + 1])
            temporal_profile[activity_pair].append(performance)

# Calculate the average and standard deviation for each activity pair
for activity_pair, performances in temporal_profile.items():
    avg = sum(performances) / len(performances)
    stdev = (sum((x - avg) ** 2 for x in performances) / len(performances)) ** 0.5
    temporal_profile[activity_pair] = (avg, stdev)

# Print the temporal profile
for activity_pair, (avg, stdev) in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"{activity_pair}: (avg={avg:.2f}, stdev={stdev:.2f})")
```

This code defines a regular expression to extract the activities and performance from each variant. It then iterates over the variants, extracts the activities and performance, and stores them in a dictionary. Finally, it calculates the average and standard deviation for each activity pair and prints the temporal profile.

Note that this code assumes that the performance values are in seconds. If they are in a different unit, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

Also, this code calculates the standard deviation using the population standard deviation formula. If you want to use the sample standard deviation formula instead, you can replace the `len(performances)` with `len(performances) - 1` in the calculation of the standard deviation.

Here is a sample output of the temporal profile:
```
('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (avg=114821.41, stdev=34051.14)
('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (avg=31794.49, stdev=13145.59)
('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): (avg=24580.38, stdev=11345.95)
('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'): (avg=52018.41, stdev=20189.85)
...
```
