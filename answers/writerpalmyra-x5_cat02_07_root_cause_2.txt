Let’s break this down step by step to identify performance issues, analyze root causes, and suggest actionable improvements.

### **1. Identify Cases with Long Durations**

We calculate the **total lead time** for each case (from *Submit Claim* to *Close Claim*):

| Case ID | Submit Claim (Start)     | Close Claim (End)        | Duration             |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 2001   | 2024-04-01 09:00          | 2024-04-01 10:30         | ~1.5 hours           |
| 2002   | 2024-04-01 09:05          | 2024-04-02 11:00         | ~35.9 hours          |
| 2003   | 2024-04-01 09:10          | 2024-04-03 09:30         | ~48.3 hours          |
| 2004   | 2024-04-01 09:20          | 2024-04-01 10:45         | ~1.4 hours           |
| 2005   | 2024-04-01 09:25          | 2024-04-04 14:30         | ~79.1 hours          |

**Observation:**
- **Fast cases (under 2 hours):** 2001, 2004  
- **Moderate delay:** 2002 (~1.5 days)  
- **Significant delays:**  
  - **2003:** ~2 days  
  - **2005:** ~3.3 days  **longest duration by far**

 **High-duration cases:** **2003** and especially **2005**

### **2. Root Cause Analysis Using Attributes**

#### **A. Complexity Level**
- **Low complexity (2001, 2004):** Both resolved quickly (<2 hrs), no document requests.
- **Medium (2002):** One *Request Additional Documents*, delay of ~36 hrs — mainly due to customer response time (gap from 4/1 14:00  4/2 10:00).
- **High (2003, 2005):**
  - Both required **multiple document requests**:
    - 2003: 2 requests (same day & next day)
    - 2005: **3 requests** over multiple days
  - Longest gaps occur **after document requests**, suggesting **slow customer response or poor communication follow-up**.

 **Pattern:** High complexity  more document iterations  longer cycles.

#### **B. Resource (Adjuster)**
Look at who handled evaluation and document requests:

| Case | Adjuster         | # of Doc Requests | Time from Last Request to Approval |
|------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 2002 | Adjuster_Lisa    | 1                 | ~20 hrs                             |
| 2003 | Adjuster_Mike    | 2                 | ~31 hrs                             |
| 2005 | Adjuster_Lisa    | 3                 | ~43 hrs                             |

- **Adjuster_Lisa** handles 2002 (1 request), 2004 (low), and **2005 (3 requests, longest wait)**.
- Even though the same resource (Lisa) handled a medium and a high-complexity case, **only 2005 had multiple follow-ups**.
- But note: **2005 had 3 requests**, possibly indicating **poor initial scoping** — maybe Lisa isn’t tailoring requests efficiently for complex claims?

 **Suspicion:** Could Adjuster_Lisa benefit from better checklists or templates for high-complexity claims to reduce iterative back-and-forth?

#### **C. Region**
- **Region A:** Cases 2001 (low), 2003 (high)
  - 2003 took ~48 hrs — long, but shorter than Region B's 2005
  - Adjuster_Mike issued two doc requests; Manager_Bill approved later
- **Region B:** 2002 (medium), 2004 (low), **2005 (high)**
  - 2005 is the **worst performer**
  - Same manager: Manager_Bill (also approved 2003)
  - Finance_Carl handled payment in both high-complex cases

 No evidence that **Region A vs B** is the primary factor, but **Region B has the single worst case**.

However, **Region B shows higher frequency of delays in medium/high claims**, possibly due to:
- Less standardized handling?
- Lower staffing?
- External factors (e.g., customers in Region B respond slower?)

But only two high-complexity cases — hard to generalize.

#### **D. Process Bottlenecks: Where Time Is Lost?**

Let’s check the **longest time gaps between events**:

- **Case 2002:**
  - 2024-04-01 14:00  2024-04-02 10:00 = **20 hrs** after document request
  - Likely: waiting for customer to respond

- **Case 2003:**
  - 4/1 17:00  4/2 16:00 = **23 hrs gap** after second request
  - Then 4/2 16:00  4/3 09:00 = **17 hrs** before payment
    - Payment delay may be due to batch processing or approval timing

- **Case 2005:**
  - 4/1 11:30  4/2 17:00 = **29.5 hrs**
  - 4/2 17:00  4/3 15:00 = **22 hrs**
  - 4/3 15:00  4/4 10:00 = **19 hrs**
  - Cumulative waiting: **~70+ hours** in total idle time, mostly post-document requests

 **Primary delay driver:** **Repeated customer follow-up cycles** and **slow turnarounds**, especially in high-complexity claims.

### **3. Conclusions & Recommendations**

####  **Summary of Findings**
| Factor        | Impact on Performance |
|--------------|------------------------|
| **High Complexity** | Strongly correlated with multiple document requests and longer durations |
| **Adjuster**        | Adjuster_Lisa handled 2005 — same adjuster as faster 2002  issue may be **claim complexity mis-handling**, not individual performance |
| **Repeated Requests** | 2003 & 2005 had multiple doc requests  inefficient initial assessment |
| **Region**          | Region B has slower high-complex case, but insufficient data to pin blame on region itself |
| **Bottleneck Phase** | **Post-document request wait times** dominate cycle time |

###  **Recommended Actions to Mitigate Delays**

1. **Improve Initial Evaluation for High-Complexity Claims**
   - Create **standardized checklist** per complexity level
   - Train adjusters to **anticipate documentation needs upfront**
   - Goal: Reduce iterative rounds by 50%

2. **Implement Automated Follow-Up System**
   - Auto-send **reminder emails/SMS** 24/48 hrs after document request
   - Escalate to supervisor if no response in 72 hrs

3. **Standardize Handling Across Regions**
   - Share best practices between Region A and B teams
   - Monitor Regional KPIs (e.g., avg. days per complexity tier)

4. **Empower Adjusters with Templates**
   - For "High" claims, require a **preliminary document map** before sending first request

5. **Review Manager Approval Timing**
   - In 2005, approval happened only after final docs — but why not sooner?
   - Consider **parallel tracking**: allow pre-approval pending doc receipt

6. **Add SLAs and Monitor Compliance**
   - E.g., “First document request within 4 business hours of evaluation”
   - Track adjuster performance across complexity tiers

###  Final Insight

> The root cause **isn’t one person or region**, but rather a **process gap in managing complexity** — specifically, **reactive and iterative documentation handling**.

 **Fix the process, not the people.** With minor improvements in upfront scoping and customer engagement, even high-complexity claims can be processed in under 2 business days.
