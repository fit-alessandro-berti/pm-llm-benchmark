Okay, let's tackle this DuckDB query problem. Hmm, the task is to filter out cases with more than six events and return the rest. So first, I need to figure out how to group the events by case_id and count them. Then filter those groups where the count is <=6. Then return all the events from those cases.

Wait, the problem says "filter out any cases containing more than six events" so the remaining cases are those with 6 or fewer. So the first step is to count the number of events per case_id. Then filter those cases where the count is <=6. Then select all the events from those cases.

So the steps would be:

1. Calculate the count of events per case_id. Let's call this count_column.
2. Filter the cases where count_column <=6. But how to do that? Maybe using a subquery or a CTE (Common Table Expression) to first get the counts, then filter based on that.

Alternatively, use a HAVING clause in a GROUP BY, but that's for aggregation. Wait, but to filter the cases, perhaps we need to first get all case_ids along with their counts, then filter those case_ids where count <=6, then select all events where the case_id is in that filtered list.

Yes, that makes sense. So the approach would be:

- First, get the count of events per case_id. Let's do that with GROUP BY case_id, then count(*) as event_count.

- Then, from that result, filter the case_ids where event_count <=6. Let's store this in another CTE or a subquery.

- Then, in the final SELECT, get all the original rows from event_log where case_id is in the filtered list.

Wait, but the problem says to return the full set of events for the remaining cases. So the final query should select all rows from event_log where the case_id's total events are <=6. But how to ensure that the case's total is <=6? Because if we just filter the case_id after counting, that's the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. First, get all the case_ids that have <=6 events. Let's call this list valid_cases.

2. Then select all events where case_id is in valid_cases.

So how to get valid_cases?

To get valid_cases, we can do a GROUP BY case_id on the event_log, count the events, then filter where the count is <=6. Then collect those case_ids into a list.

In DuckDB, this can be done with a CTE. Let's see:

WITH valid_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
    ) AS counts
    WHERE event_count <=6
)
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_cases);

Wait, but maybe the inner query can be optimized. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the inner query can directly get the counts, then filter:

WITH counts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
valid_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM counts
    WHERE event_count <=6
)
SELECT event_log.case_id, ... all columns ...
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_cases);

But this way, the final SELECT is on the original event_log table, and only includes rows where the case_id is in valid_cases. That should work.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to do this without a CTE, but using subqueries. But using CTEs is clearer here.

Wait, but in the counts CTE, we already have the counts. Then the valid_cases is derived from that. Then the final query selects all events where case_id is in valid_cases. That should be efficient.

But what about cases where a case_id has exactly 6 events? They are included. Those with more than six are excluded.

Yes. So this approach should work.

Another thing to consider: the problem says "filter out any cases containing more than six events". So the cases that remain are those with 6 or fewer. So the valid_cases includes those.

Now, the final SELECT is from the original event_log table, but only those rows where the case_id is in valid_cases.

But what if the event_log has a lot of data? This could be inefficient because it's joining back on the case_id. But given the problem constraints, this is probably acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a window function to count the events per case_id, then filter the cases, and then select all rows from those cases. But that would require partitioning the data into the cases that are valid, which again would require the same approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the query can be written as:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id FROM (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) <=6
    ) AS valid_cases
);

Wait, that's a subquery that selects all distinct case_ids with count <=6. Then the main query selects all rows from event_log where case_id is in that list. That would work. Let me see.

Yes, because the subquery first groups by case_id, counts them, applies the HAVING clause to keep those with count <=6. Then the distinct is redundant here because grouping by case_id would already give each case once. Wait, the subquery inside the IN clause's subquery is:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM (SELECT GROUP BY case_id ...)

But when you group by case_id, each case_id appears once in the grouped result. So the DISTINCT is unnecessary. So the subquery can be simplified to:

SELECT CASE_ID FROM (SELECT GROUP BY CASE_ID ...) AS grouped
WHERE COUNT(*) <=6

Wait, no. Let me rephrase:

The inner query (the one inside the subquery for the IN list) would first group by case_id, count them, then select those where the count is <=6. Then the outer subquery selects all case_ids from that result. So the code would be:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
    ) AS counts
    WHERE cnt <=6
);

Wait, but in this case, the inner query groups by case_id, counts them, then selects those with cnt <=6, and then the outer subquery selects the case_ids from that. Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id FROM (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) <=6
    ) AS valid_cases
);

Wait, but the HAVING clause requires that the group by is already done. Wait no, the HAVING is applied after grouping. So the correct way is to first group by case_id, then count, then apply HAVING. Wait, but in the subquery:

The subquery inside the IN's subquery is:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id
) AS counts WHERE cnt <=6

Wait, but the counts query already groups by case_id and counts each group. Then the outer query selects the case_ids where their count is <=6. Then the IN clause selects those case_ids, and the main query picks all rows from event_log where case_id is in that list.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written more concisely using a single CTE. Let me see.

Alternatively, here's another approach using window functions. But window functions might not be necessary here since we just need the count per case.

Alternatively, the first approach with the two CTEs might be clearer. Let me think again.

The first approach with the counts CTE and then valid_cases CTE:

WITH counts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
valid_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM counts
    WHERE event_count <=6
)
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_cases);

This should work. The counts CTE gets all case_ids with their event counts. Then valid_cases selects those case_ids where the count is <=6. Then the final SELECT gets all events where case_id is in valid_cases.

This should be correct. But what if there are no cases with more than six events? Then all cases are included. That's correct.

Another edge case: a case with exactly six events is included, which is correct. A case with seven is excluded.

Now, the problem says "filter out any cases containing more than six events". So the remaining cases are those with 6 or fewer. So the query is correct.

Now, the problem requires that the query returns the full set of events from the remaining cases. So the approach is correct.

Now, the question is, how to write this in DuckDB SQL.

In DuckDB, the syntax is similar to PostgreSQL but with some differences. For example, the GROUP BY clause requires ordering by the group columns, but in some cases, you can omit it if the group columns are not needed in the SELECT. Wait, no, in DuckDB, when using GROUP BY, you need to list all selected columns that are in the GROUP BY clause. But in the counts CTE, the SELECT is case_id and COUNT(*) as event_count. So the GROUP BY case_id is sufficient. So the counts CTE should work.

Then the valid_cases CTE selects from counts where event_count <=6. Then the final query selects all event_log rows where case_id is in valid_cases.

Yes. So the code would be:

WITH counts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
valid_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM counts
    WHERE event_count <= 6
)
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_cases);

Wait, but the DISTINCT in valid_cases is redundant because when you select from counts (which groups by case_id), each case_id appears once. So the DISTINCT is unnecessary here. So the valid_cases can be written as:

SELECT case_id FROM counts WHERE event_count <=6;

But to be safe, maybe it's better to include it, but in this case, it's not needed. So the valid_cases can be simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps the counts CTE already has one row per case_id, so the subquery can directly select case_id from counts where the condition holds.

So the valid_cases CTE can be written as:

SELECT case_id FROM (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id
) AS counts WHERE COUNT(*) <=6;

Wait, but in this case, the counts are already computed in the inner SELECT. So the outer query can directly filter on the counts. Wait, but the outer query is selecting case_id from the inner query (which is the grouped counts). Wait no, perhaps the code should be:

valid_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id
    ) AS grouped_counts
    WHERE cnt <=6
)

Ah right, because the inner query groups by case_id and counts, then the outer query selects the case_ids where their count (cnt) is <=6. So the code would need to reference the cnt variable in the WHERE clause. So the valid_cases CTE would need to use the cnt variable from the inner query.

Therefore, the correct code for the valid_cases CTE would be:

valid_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
    ) AS grouped
    WHERE cnt <=6
)

Ah, right. Because the inner query (grouped) has the cnt column. So the outer query (valid_cases) selects case_id from grouped where cnt <=6.

So the valid_cases CTE is correct. Then the main query selects all events where case_id is in valid_cases.case_id.

Putting it all together:

WITH counts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
valid_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM counts
    WHERE event_count <=6
)
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_cases);

Alternatively, the valid_cases can be derived from the counts CTE without needing the DISTINCT, since each case_id appears once. So:

valid_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id FROM counts WHERE event_count <=6
)

Which is more efficient. So the code can be simplified to that.

Therefore, the final query would be:

WITH counts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
valid_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id FROM counts WHERE event_count <=6
)
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_cases);

Yes, that should work. Let me check again.

The counts CTE gives each case_id and their event counts. Then valid_cases selects those case_ids where the count is <=6. Then the final query selects all rows from event_log where the case_id is in valid_cases. Exactly what's needed.

Another possible optimization: since the counts are already available, perhaps the final query can be written as:

SELECT * FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM (
        SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) <=6
    ) AS valid_cases
);

But this approach groups all the counts again, but in a single subquery. It might be slightly less efficient because it does the grouping twice. The first approach groups once in counts, then again in the subquery for valid_cases. Hmm, so the first approach groups once, then uses the already computed counts. So the first approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the first approach is better in terms of performance.

Another thing to note: in DuckDB, when you use GROUP BY without specifying the columns in the SELECT, it requires that you list all the selected columns in the GROUP BY clause. Wait, in the counts CTE, the SELECT is case_id and COUNT(*) as event_count. Since case_id is part of the GROUP BY, that's okay. So the GROUP BY case_id is sufficient. So that's correct.

Therefore, the code should work as written.

Now, the problem requires that the query filters out cases with more than six events. So the code correctly selects only those cases with <=6 events, then returns all their events.

Another possible edge case: if a case has exactly six events, it's included. If a case has seven, excluded. That's correct.

So this should be the correct query.

Here’s the DuckDB SQL query to solve the problem:

```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        COUNT(*) AS event_count 
    FROM event_log 
    GROUP BY case_id
),
valid_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id 
    FROM case_counts 
    WHERE event_count <= 6
)
SELECT * FROM event_log 
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_cases);
```

### Explanation:
1. **`case_counts` CTE**: Groups events by `case_id` and calculates the total event count per case.
2. **`valid_cases` CTE**: Filters the `case_id` entries from `case_counts` to include only those with 6 or fewer events.
3. **Final Query**: Selects all rows from `event_log` where `case_id` is in the list of valid cases (those with 6 events). This ensures only events from qualifying cases are returned.
