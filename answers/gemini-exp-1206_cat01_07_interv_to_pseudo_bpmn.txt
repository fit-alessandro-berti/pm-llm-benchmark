Okay, based on the interview transcripts, here is a textual description of the invoice approval process, designed to be readily convertible into a BPMN diagram:

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process

**Participants:**

*   Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk (e.g., Mary)
*   Purchasing Officer (e.g., Dan)
*   Department Manager (e.g., Carlos)
*   Accounts Payable Supervisor (e.g., Rita)
*   Supplier Relationship Manager (e.g., Karen)
*   Accounting System
*   Email System

**Process Flow:**

1. **Start Event:** Invoice Received (typically via email)

2. **Task:** Check for PO Number (AP Clerk)
    *   Input: Invoice
    *   Output: Invoice with/without PO noted

3. **Gateway (Exclusive):** PO Number Present?
    *   **Yes:** Proceed to Task 4.
    *   **No:** Proceed to Task 3a.

    3a. **Task:** Request PO Details from Supplier (AP Clerk)
        *   Input: Invoice without PO
        *   Output: Communication to Supplier, potentially a rejected invoice

    3b. **Gateway (Exclusive):** PO Details Received from Supplier?
       *   **Yes:** Proceed to Task 4.
       *   **No:**  End Process. (The invoice remains unprocessed, needing further handling, potentially by AP Supervisor).
       *   **Alternative if Supplier Relationship Manager Involved:** If the AP Clerk cannot get the PO, they may loop in the Supplier Relationship Manager to get the PO or a revised invoice (Task 3c). Then back to Task 4.

    3c. **Task (if needed):** Contact Supplier for PO Details (Supplier Relationship Manager)
       * Input: Invoice, notice from AP
       * Output: PO details or revised invoice from Supplier
       * Then: Back to Task 4.

    *   Output: Email to Purchasing Officer

6. **Task:** Confirm Invoice Details Against PO (Purchasing Officer)
    *   Input: Invoice, PO (from system)
    *   Output: Confirmation email or Discrepancy noted

7. **Gateway (Exclusive):** Invoice Matches PO?
    *   **Yes:** Proceed to Task 8.
    *   **No:** Proceed to Task 7a.

    7a. **Task:** Clarify Discrepancy (Purchasing Officer/AP Clerk/Supplier Relationship Manager)
        *   Input: Invoice, PO, Discrepancy details
        *   Output: Communication with Supplier or Internal Resolution
        *   Participants: This task may involve back-and-forth between the Purchasing Officer, the AP Clerk, and, if needed, the Supplier Relationship Manager to correct pricing, quantities, or obtain a revised invoice.

    7b. **Gateway (Exclusive):** Discrepancy Resolved?
       * **Yes:** Proceed to Task 8
       * **No:** Proceed to Task 7c

    7c. **Task:** Escalate to AP Supervisor (AP Clerk)
        *   Input: Unresolved discrepancy
        *   Output: Escalation notification

    7d. **Task:** Resolve Exception (AP Supervisor)
        *   Input: Escalated issue
        *   Output: Resolved discrepancy or decision to reject the invoice.
        *   Participants: The AP Supervisor may contact suppliers, coordinate between departments, or create retrospective POs if necessary.

    7e. **Gateway (Exclusive):** Exception Resolved?
        *   **Yes:** Proceed to Task 8
        *   **No:** End Process (invoice likely rejected or requires further manual intervention)

8. **Task:** Send Invoice to Manager for Approval (AP Clerk)
    *   Input: Confirmed Invoice
    *   Output: Email to Department Manager, system notification

9. **Task:** Review and Approve Invoice (Department Manager)
    *   Input: Invoice, PO, Confirmation details (from system)
    *   Output: Approval or Rejection in the system

10. **Gateway (Exclusive):** Invoice Approved?
    *   **Yes:** Proceed to Task 11.
    *   **No:** Proceed to Task 10a.

    10a. **Task:** Investigate Rejection (Department Manager/AP Clerk)
        *   Input: Rejected invoice, reason for rejection
        *   Output: Resolution or further action. The manager might reject it or request the AP clerk to investigate.
        * Note: Details about how rejected invoices are processed are not entirely clear from the interviews, but it may involve escalation or direct communication to resolve the issue.

    10b. **Gateway (Exclusive):** Rejection Resolved?
        *   **Yes:** Proceed to Task 9 (Re-approval)
        *   **No:** End Process (Invoice likely rejected)

11. **Task:** Schedule Invoice for Payment (AP Clerk)
    *   Input: Approved Invoice
    *   Output: Invoice scheduled in the payment system

12. **End Event:** Invoice Processed for Payment

**Notes and Uncertainties:**

*   The exact handling of rejected invoices (after the Department Manager rejects them) is not fully specified in the interviews. There might be a more defined process for handling these cases.
*   There is an assumption the Supplier Relationship Manager may be contacted directly by the AP Clerk if a PO is missing from an invoice (Task 3c). This would be an alternative if the Supplier does not respond to the AP Clerk's request.
*   The interviews don't fully describe the payment execution process itself; it's simply indicated that approved invoices are scheduled for payment.
*   The frequency of retrospective PO creation by the AP Supervisor is unclear, but it is presented as an exception handling mechanism.

This textual description provides a structured, BPMN-like representation of the invoice approval process based on the interview data. It highlights the core tasks, decision points, roles, and exceptions, while also acknowledging areas where the interviews leave some ambiguity. This can now be used to create a visual BPMN diagram.
