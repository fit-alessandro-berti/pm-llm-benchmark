In the context of fairness, sensitive attributes are those which, if used in decision-making processes, could lead to biased or unfair outcomes based on characteristics that are not relevant to the fairness of the process. These attributes are often associated with personal demographic information (protected classes) that should not unjustly influence decisions. Typical sensitive attributes include race, gender, age, religion, nationality/citizenship status, etc.

Let's go through the attributes in the given event log to identify which ones are sensitive:

1. **case:citizen**:
   - This attribute captures the citizenship status of the individual. Different treatment based on citizenship could be a source of bias. Decisions or performance metrics might be skewed based on whether someone is a citizen or not. Thus, this attribute is **sensitive** for fairness.
   
2. **case:gender**:
   - Gender information can give rise to unfair practices based on gender discrimination. Especially when gender is irrelevant to the candidate’s ability to perform in the job, this attribute is considered **sensitive** for fairness.
   
3. **case:german speaking**:
   - Whether someone speaks German or not could potentially affect their consideration unfairly, especially if language skills are not a relevant requirement for the role. If fairness is to be maintained, this could be a **sensitive** attribute. However, if language skills are strictly required for the role, this would be less sensitive in that specific context.

4. **case:religious**:
   - Religion is almost always considered a **sensitive** attribute for fairness, as people should not be treated differently based on their religious beliefs in any recruitment process.

5. **activity**:
   - This represents the stages or activities the candidate goes through in the job application process (e.g., "Hand In Job Application", "Telephonic Screening"). These actions are not tied to personal demographic characteristics and are thus not inherently sensitive concerning fairness. These activities might be influenced by decision bias, but the attribute itself is not sensitive.
   
6. **concept:name**:
   - Similar to the "activity" attribute, this reflects the event or activity name and does not inherently involve demographic or personal attributes. Therefore, it is not a **sensitive** attribute.

7. **resource**:
   - This refers to the resources involved in the process (e.g., "HR-dummy", "Senior Partner", etc.). While this attribute could affect process efficiency or actions, it doesn't directly relate to the demographic or protected characteristics of the applicants. Hence, it is **not sensitive** in the context of fairness regarding the individual applicants.

8. **start_timestamp / time / time:timestamp**:
   - These attributes capture time-based information. They primarily concern timing and scheduling rather than the individual's personal characteristics. Time data is important for performance evaluation, but in terms of fairness towards the applicants, it's not a **sensitive** attribute.

### Summary of Sensitive Attributes:
- **case:citizen** (citizenship status).
- **case:gender**.
- **case:german speaking** (depending on whether language is a legitimate job requirement).
- **case:religious** (religion).

These sensitive attributes could potentially lead to unfair treatment in decisions such as rejecting applications, progressing candidates to interviews, or making job offers.

In practice, organizations applying fairness auditing or designing fair decision-making processes should ensure that these attributes do not influence critical decisions inappropriately or lead to discriminatory practices.
