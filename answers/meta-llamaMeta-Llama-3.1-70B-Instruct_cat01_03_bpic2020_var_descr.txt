I'll try to break down the process variants and identify the underlying process.

**Overview**
The process appears to be a declaration or expense reimbursement process, where an employee submits a declaration, which then goes through various approval stages before payment is handled.

**Main Process Flow**

1. An employee submits a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).
2. The declaration is approved by an administrator (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`).
3. The declaration is then approved by a supervisor or a budget owner (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` or `Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`).
4. After final approval, a payment request is generated (`Request Payment`).
5. The payment is handled (`Payment Handled`).

**Variations and Exceptions**

There are several variations and exceptions in the process, including:

* **Rejection**: A declaration can be rejected by an administrator, supervisor, or budget owner at various stages (`Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`, or `Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`).
* **Resubmission**: If a declaration is rejected, the employee can resubmit it (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` after rejection).
* **Additional Approvals**: In some cases, additional approvals are required, such as approval by a pre-approver (`Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`) or a second approval by an administrator (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION` after rejection).
* **Missing Information**: In some cases, a declaration is rejected due to missing information (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`).

**Other Observations**

* There are some process variants with very low frequencies (e.g., `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` with a frequency of 5). These may indicate rare or exceptional cases.
* The performance metrics (e.g., `performance = 810187.903`) are likely indicative of processing time or cost, but without further context, it's difficult to interpret these values.

Please note that this analysis is based on a single data set and may not capture the entire process complexity. There might be additional process steps
