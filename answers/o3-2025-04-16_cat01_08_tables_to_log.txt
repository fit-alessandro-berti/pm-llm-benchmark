### Notes & Assumptions  
1. Case notion – every `order_id` equals one process instance (case).  
2. One event per significant business step:  
   • order creation,  
   • each item picking action,  
   • every delivery dispatch & arrival,  
   • every invoice issuance,  
   • every individual payment.  
3. Resources are enriched via the Resources table; when the actor is not captured (payments), a generic “Payment System” resource is used.  
4. Additional attributes are grouped in the “Details” column; feel free to split them into dedicated columns if the mining tool prefers flat attributes.  
5. Events are already in chronological order inside each case; the table can be re-sorted globally by timestamp if required by your tool.  
6. Orders 1004 has no delivery / invoice / payment yet; the log faithfully stops after the last recorded action.
