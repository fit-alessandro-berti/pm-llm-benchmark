To determine if the given attributes are sensitive to fairness, we need to consider whether they could be used as a proxy for protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender) that might lead to different treatment under certain systems.

Let's analyze each attribute:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute represents whether an individual is a citizen. If someone was excluded based on citizenship status in the loan process, it would raise concerns about bias related to ethnicity or national origin (protected characteristics).

2. **case:gender**: Gender could be a sensitive attribute for fairness issues because it can relate to protected classes such as gender identity and expression. Policies that differentiate treatment based on gender without justification might be unfair.

3. **case:german speaking**: This represents whether the individual speaks German. While it isn't directly linked to any legal protected characteristics, it could indirectly influence outcomes in a way that is perceived as discriminatory or preferential towards certain linguistic backgrounds.

4. **resource**: The resource type (e.g., Loan Officer 1, Online System) does not inherently represent sensitive information and usually represents the specific tool used for the interaction rather than personal attributes.

5. **start_timestamp** and **time** are timestamps representing when interactions occurred; these do not carry any sensitivity or bias considerations related to protected characteristics.

6. **resource**: Similarly to "case:german speaking," resource type itself does not represent sensitive information but can influence perception of the fairness due to potential biases associated with different resources (e.g., Loan Officer 1 vs. Online System).

Based on this analysis, we can conclude:

- The attributes that could potentially be sensitive for fairness are **"case:citizen"** and **"case:gender."**

- "case:german speaking" may also pose a risk of bias, although more indirectly.

It's important to consider these attributes in the context of the fairness framework being applied. Fairness can sometimes manifest as unintended biases embedded within data fields or resource allocation, even if they do not directly represent protected characteristics themselves.
