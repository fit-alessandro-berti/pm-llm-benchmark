Of course. Here is the merged event log, along with a detailed explanation of the methodology used to integrate the two logs.

### Merging Methodology and Reasoning

The process of merging Log A and Log B was guided by the requirements to match corresponding events, handle discrepancies, and enrich the final log with all available data. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Timestamp as Primary Key for Sorting**: The timestamps from **Log A** were chosen as the primary `timestamp` for the merged log. This decision establishes a consistent, primary timeline as requested. Timestamps from Log B are preserved in a separate `timestamp_system_b` attribute to retain all original data.

2.  **Matching Criteria**: Events were considered a match if they met the following criteria:
    *   **Same `order_id`**: Both events must belong to `Order#1234`.
    *   **Timestamp Proximity**: The timestamps must be within a **2-second tolerance**. For example, `10:00:00Z` and `09:59:58Z` are considered a match because their difference is exactly 2 seconds.
    *   **Conceptual Equivalence**: The event names must refer to the same business step, even if the naming convention differs (e.g., "Order Received" vs. "OrderReceived").

3.  **Attribute Integration**: For matched events, all attributes from both logs were combined into a single record.
    *   **Unified Event Name**: The more descriptive name from Log A (e.g., "Order Received") was used as the primary `event_name`. The name from Log B is preserved in `event_name_system_b`.
    *   **Data Enrichment**: Attributes unique to Log B (`user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes`) were added to the merged record, creating a richer view of the event.

4.  **Conflict and Mismatch Resolution**:
    *   **"Payment Processed" vs. "PaymentCheck"**: These two events were **not merged**. Although they sound related, their timestamps (`10:02:00Z` vs. `10:02:05Z`) are 5 seconds apart, which is outside the defined 2-second tolerance. The notes in Log B ("Payment gateway delay") also suggest that "PaymentCheck" might be a distinct, preceding step to the final "Payment Processed" confirmation. They are therefore included as two separate, sequential events.
    *   **"Quality Check" Event**: This event only exists in Log B. It has no corresponding event in Log A within the time tolerance. It has been included as-is in the final log, with its source clearly identifiable by the populated System B attributes.
    *   **"Item Delivered" Event**: This event only exists in Log A. It has no match in Log B and is included as-is in the final chronological log.

### Final Merged Event Log

The following table presents the integrated log, sorted chronologically. Each row represents a unique event, either merged from both logs or originating from a single source.
