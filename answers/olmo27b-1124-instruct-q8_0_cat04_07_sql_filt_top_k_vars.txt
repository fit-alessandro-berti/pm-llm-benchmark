### Explanation:

1. **Ordered Events Subquery (`OrderedEvents`):**
   - This subquery assigns a row number to each event within its `case_id`, ordered by the `timestamp`.

2. **Activity Sequences Subquery (`ActivitySequences`):**
   - Aggregates activities per `case_id` into a single string, preserving the order defined by `timestamp`.

3. **Top K Variants Subquery (`TopKVariants`):**
   - Counts how many times each process sequence appears across all cases and selects the top `K` sequences.

4. **Main Query:**
   - Filters down to events from `event_log` that belong only to cases which match one of the top `K` variants, as determined in the `TopKVariants` subquery.

**Assumptions:**

- The value of `K` is assumed to be provided when executing the query. If `K` is not specified, you would need to adjust the `LIMIT K` clause accordingly or modify the logic to handle an unspecified number.
- Ensure that all identifiers (`case_id`, `activity`) and data types align with your actual database schema.
- The SQL above assumes a PostgreSQL-like syntax. Adjustments might be necessary depending on the specific SQL dialect being used.

This query structure captures the essence of querying for process variants, counting case occurrences per variant, and filtering down to a specified set of top variants along with their corresponding events, as requested in the prompt.
