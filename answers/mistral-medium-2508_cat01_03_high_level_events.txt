### **Proposed High-Level Process Steps for Manufacturing Workflow**

Based on the provided event log, the low-level events can be grouped into **five coherent high-level process steps** that represent distinct stages of the manufacturing process. Below is the structured breakdown, including the rationale for grouping and proposed names.

---

### **1. Material Preparation**
**Low-Level Events Included:**
- `Retrieve raw metal sheet`
- `Scan barcode`
- `Place metal sheet on table`
- `Align metal sheet`
- `Preheat metal sheet`

**Rationale:**
- These events all pertain to **preparing the raw material** before assembly.
- They are **temporally close** (occurring within the first ~20 seconds of each case).
- They involve **initial handling by operators and machines** (Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1).
- Logically, they form a **preparatory phase** where the material is readied for welding.

---

### **2. Welding & Assembly**
**Low-Level Events Included:**
- `Pick up welding tool`
- `Weld corner A`
- `Weld corner B`

**Rationale:**
- These events are **directly related to assembly** (joining parts via welding).
- They are performed by the **same operator (Operator B)** using the same tool (`ToolID: W-12`).
- They represent a **core manufacturing step** where structural integrity is established.

---

### **3. Quality Inspection (Post-Welding)**
**Low-Level Events Included:**
- `Measure weld integrity`

**Rationale:**
- This is a **standalone quality check** to ensure the welding was successful.
- It is performed by a **dedicated quality sensor (Quality Sensor #1)**.
- It logically follows welding and precedes further processing.

---

### **4. Surface Treatment**
**Low-Level Events Included:**
- `Apply protective coating`
- `Dry coating`

**Rationale:**
- These events involve **applying and curing a protective layer** (e.g., polyurethane).
- They are performed by **specialized units (Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2)**.
- They represent a **finishing step** to enhance durability.

---

### **5. Final Inspection & Approval**
**Low-Level Events Included:**
- `Visual check`

**Rationale:**
- This is the **final quality assurance step** before the product is considered complete.
- It is performed by a **human operator (Operator C)** for a holistic check.
- It ensures the product meets all standards before moving to the next stage (e.g., packaging/shipping).

### **Key Observations & Generalization Rules**
1. **Temporal Proximity:** Events occurring in quick succession (e.g., within ~20-30 seconds) often belong to the same high-level step.
2. **Resource Consistency:** Events performed by the same operator/machine (e.g., Operator B for welding) are likely part of the same phase.
3. **Logical Flow:** The sequence follows a natural progression:
   **Preparation  Assembly  Quality Check  Finishing  Final Inspection**.
4. **Domain Knowledge:** Manufacturing processes typically separate:
   - **Preparatory work** (material handling),
   - **Core assembly** (welding, fastening),
   - **Quality checks** (inspections, measurements),
   - **Finishing** (coating, drying),
   - **Final validation** (visual/audit checks).

### **Example Application to Given Log**
For **CaseID A1**, the high-level steps would be:
1. **Material Preparation** (08:00:05 – 08:00:20)
2. **Welding & Assembly** (08:01:00 – 08:01:10)
3. **Quality Inspection** (08:01:20)
4. **Surface Treatment** (08:01:30 – 08:01:45)
5. **Final Inspection** (08:02:00)

This grouping holds consistently for **CaseID B2** as well.

### **Potential Extensions**
- If additional events (e.g., `Packaging`, `Shipping`) were present, they could form new high-level steps like **"Post-Processing"** or **"Logistics."**
- Machine learning techniques (e.g., clustering) could automate this grouping for larger logs by detecting patterns in timestamps, resources, and event types.

This approach ensures the **manufacturing process is abstracted into meaningful, actionable stages** while preserving the underlying logic of the workflow.
