The diagram depicts the process flow for shipping goods to customers and handling insurance claims.

The process starts with shipping goods. If the goods are delayed, the customer is notified through the "clarify shipment method" process. A special handling process is triggered if insurance is required. Otherwise, the package label is always written and the package goods are prepped for shipment.

If insurance is necessary, the process checks if it's required. If so, the customer information is captured and 3 offers are made for different logistic companies. The logistic company is selected and an insurance parcel is placed on the shipment.

Finally, the goods are packaged and the shipment paperwork is filled out. The package is then moved to the pickup area and prepared for shipment.

Overall, it outlines the key decision points and steps involved in shipping goods and handling insurance when required, with the ultimate goal of getting the package shipped out to the customer.
