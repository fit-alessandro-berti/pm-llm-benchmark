### Proposed High-Level Activities for Manufacturing Process

#### Case Processing Overview:

Each case (identified by `CaseID`) represents the production of a single item, passing through several distinct phases: Material Preparation, Assembly, Quality Inspection, and Final Check. The events within each phase are logically grouped based on their temporal proximity, logical sequence, and shared resource involvement.

#### 1. **Material Preparation**

   **Grouped Events:**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet (Activity: "Retrieve raw metal sheet")
   - Scan barcode (Activity: "Scan barcode")
   - Place metal sheet on table (Activity: "Place metal sheet on table")
   - Align metal sheet (Activity: "Align metal sheet")
   - Preheat metal sheet (Activity: "Preheat metal sheet")

   **Rationale:** These events involve the initial handling and setup of a new raw material (metal sheet) for production. They are performed sequentially, starting with retrieval and ending with preheating, ensuring the material is ready for subsequent assembly operations.

#### 2. **Assembly**

   **Grouped Events:**
   - Pick up welding tool (Activity: "Pick up welding tool")
   - Weld corner A (Activity: "Weld corner A")
   - Weld corner B (Activity: "Weld corner B")
   - Measure weld integrity (Activity: "Measure weld integrity")

   **Rationale:** These activities pertain to the primary construction or assembly of the product. They involve setting up and executing welding operations to join different parts, followed by inspection to ensure quality standards are met.

#### 3. **Finishing**

   **Grouped Events:**
   - Apply protective coating (Activity: "Apply protective coating")
   - Dry coating (Activity: "Dry coating")

   **Rationale:** These steps relate to applying a finish or protection layer to the assembled product, likely for durability and/or aesthetic purposes. They involve operations like applying a coating and subsequent drying to ensure proper adhesion and curing.

#### 4. **Quality Inspection & Final Check**

   **Grouped Events:**
   - Visual check (Activity: "Visual check")

   **Rationale:** This final activity ensures the product meets all visual quality standards before being considered complete, representing a crucial quality control checkpoint in the manufacturing process.
