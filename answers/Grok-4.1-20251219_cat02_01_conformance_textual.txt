### Analysis of Cases

#### Case 1
Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order

This follows the normative happy path exactly as described for sufficient inventory: Receive → Check → Authorize → Package → Ship → Close.  
**No violation.**

#### Case 2
Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Package items → Authorize payment → Ship order → Close order

Key violations:
- "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment".  
  The description explicitly states that "Package items" should only occur **after** authorization ("Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment"). It also emphasizes that "packaging items before authorization" is a violation.
- "Authorize payment" should only occur after inventory is confirmed sufficient (which it implicitly is here, since fulfillment continues), but more critically, it is misplaced in the sequence relative to packaging.

**Violates the normative process.**

#### Case 3
Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Cancel order → Ship order → Close order

Key violations:
- "Authorize payment" occurs immediately after "Check inventory", followed by "Cancel order".  
  This implies payment was authorized even though the order was ultimately canceled (presumably due to insufficient inventory). The description states that payment authorization "only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known" and is part of the fulfillment path. Authorizing payment in a case that leads to cancellation is illogical and contradicts the intended branching.
- "Ship order" occurs **after** "Cancel order".  
  The description explicitly prohibits continuing with fulfillment activities after cancellation ("it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)" and "Ship order ... never after a cancellation").

**Violates the normative process.**

#### Case 4
Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Cancel order → Close order

This exactly matches the described cancellation path for insufficient inventory: Receive → Check → Cancel → Close. No fulfillment activities occur after cancellation, and Close is final.  
**No violation.**

#### Case 5
Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Ship order → Close order

Key issue: "Package items" is completely missing.

The normative description for the fulfillment path requires "Package items" between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order" ("Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'" and "'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping"). Skipping packaging means items are shipped without being prepared, which violates the stated principle that items must be prepared before shipping.

**Violates the normative process.**

### Summary of Deviating Cases

The following cases deviate from the normative process:

- **Case 2**: Packages items before authorizing payment (explicitly prohibited order).
- **Case 3**: Authorizes payment before canceling (illogical in cancellation branch) and ships order after cancellation (explicitly prohibited).
- **Case 5**: Skips "Package items" entirely; ships without prior packaging (violates the requirement that packaging must precede shipping in the fulfillment path).

Cases 1 and 4 conform to the described normative flows (fulfillment and cancellation, respectively).
