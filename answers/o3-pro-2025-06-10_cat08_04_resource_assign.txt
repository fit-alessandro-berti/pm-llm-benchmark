1. ANALYZING RESOURCE BEHAVIOR AND ASSIGNMENT PATTERNS
-------------------------------------------------------
a. KPIs / Measures to compute from the event log
• Work-in-process per agent & per tier (open tickets in parallel).  
• Ticket Intakes per agent/tier (cases started per day / shift).  
• Mean / median activity processing time (start-to-complete) by activity & agent.  
• Queue / waiting time before each “Work Lx Start”.  
• First-Call-Resolution rate (tickets closed at L1 without “Escalate”).  
• Mean number of reassignments / escalations per ticket.  
• SLA hit/miss per priority, correlated with first-assigned agent & tier.  
• Required-Skill vs. Assigned-Skill matrix:  % of tickets handled by agents whose skill set contained the Required Skill; % handled by over-qualified specialists.  
• Utilisation = ( processing time) / (shift capacity) per agent, skill, tier.

b. Process-mining techniques to discover the real assignment logic
• Resource Interaction / Social Network Analysis  
  – “Handover-of-work” graph: node = agent/tier, edge = frequency + avg delay between “Work End” of one agent and “Work Start” of the next. Highlights who really escalates to whom and where loop-backs happen.  
• Role Discovery / Clustering  
  – Cluster resources by activity profiles; compare discovered roles to the formal L1/L2/L3 tiers to detect mismatch (e.g. some L1 agents behaving like L2).  
• Performance overlay on the discovered process model  
  – Colour edges by mean waiting time per tier to visualise bottlenecks.  
• Organisational mining on “skills” attribute  
  – Build bipartite graph Skill  Agent to visualise coverage and identify rare skills.

c. Skill-utilisation diagnostics
For every Required Skill S:  
  Utilisation(S) =  processing time on tickets that truly needed S  
                    ÷  paid capacity of agents possessing S.  
Compute “Over-qualification Index” per agent = % of work on tickets where Required Skill  agent skills but ticket could have been handled by lower tier.  
Frequent high index for L2/L3 shows specialists being used for L1 tasks.

-------------------------------------------------------
2. IDENTIFYING RESOURCE-RELATED BOTTLENECKS AND ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------
Examples of findings you can obtain from the above analyses:

1. Skill shortage bottleneck  
   • Only 4 agents have ‘Networking-Firewall’; their mean queue waiting = 3 h vs. global average 45 min.  
   • 71 % of P2 firewall tickets breaching SLA waited >2 h for first L2 touch.

2. Reassignment delay  
   • Tickets with 2 reassignments have +6.8 h mean resolution time.  
   • Each reassignment adds median 40 min idle time (time between “Reassign” and next “Work Start”).

3. Wrong first assignment  
   • 28 % of tickets first assigned to an agent lacking the Required Skill.  
   • These cases explain 54 % of all P3 SLA breaches.

4. Uneven workload  
   • Gini coefficient of agent utilisation = 0.37 (high).  
   • Top 10 % of agents process 42 % of all activities while 25 % work <60 % of capacity.

5. Specialist misuse  
   • L2/L3 spend 18 % of their time on tickets whose Required Skill = “Basic-Troubleshoot”, leading to opportunity cost of approx. 420 specialist hours / month.

-------------------------------------------------------
3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF ASSIGNMENT INEFFICIENCIES
-------------------------------------------------------
a. Inadequate assignment rule  
   Round-robin disregards skills and live queue length  mis-routing & overload.

b. Incomplete skill catalogue  
   13 % of agents’ true competencies (found by Role Discovery and text mining ticket notes) are missing from the HR skill table.

c. Poor ticket categorisation at intake  
   Variant analysis:  
   • Variant A (correct category, no reassignment) median resolution 2 h 40 m.  
   • Variant B (category corrected later) median 8 h 05 m.  
   Decision mining on the “Assign L1” step shows that if Channel = Phone + keywords {“password”, “access”} probability of wrong category rises to 0.46.

d. Lack of workload visibility  
   Dispatcher decisions ignore real-time backlog—shown by cases where idle agents exist while tickets queue for busy ones.

e. L1 capability gap  
   First-Call-Resolution differs widely: best L1 cluster 42 %, worst 8 %. Correlates with training hours <10 h / quarter.

-------------------------------------------------------
4. DATA-DRIVEN RESOURCE ASSIGNMENT STRATEGIES
-------------------------------------------------------
Strategy 1 – Skill- & Proficiency-based Routing Engine  
• Issue addressed: Wrong first assignment, specialist misuse.  
• Logic: For each new ticket, match Required Skill & Priority to agent skill matrix; weight by proficiency (1–5) and current utilisation; pick highest score.  
• Data needed: Cleaned agent skill/proficiency table, live utilisation feed, historical SLA impact per skill.  
• Expected benefits: –35 % reassignments, +12 pp FCR, +18 pp SLA compliance for P2/P3.

Strategy 2 – Workload-Aware Dynamic Dispatching  
• Issue addressed: Uneven workload, queue delays.  
• Logic: Every 5 minutes compute backlog per agent; adjust assignment so that predicted finish time < SLA threshold. Use short-term forecasting (ARIMA/queueing) for incoming volume.  
• Data: Real-time event stream of assignment & work start/end, agent shift calendar.  
• Benefits: Balance utilisation Gini to <0.2, cut average waiting time before first touch by 40 %.

Strategy 3 – Predictive Skill & Complexity Estimation at Intake  
• Issue addressed: Poor ticket categorisation & unnecessary escalations.  
• Logic: ML classifier (e.g., BERT + gradient boosting) trained on historical ticket descriptions to predict: (a) Category, (b) Required Skill, (c) Probability L1 can resolve. UI suggests result to L1/dispatcher.  
• Data: Ticket descriptions, final resolved skill, resolution tier, outcome.  
• Benefits: 25 % fewer wrong categories, 10 pp increase in L1 FCR, freeing 300 L2 hours/month.

Optional complementary actions derived from analysis
• Targeted L1 upskilling for top 5 low-FCR categories.  
• Introduce “flex agents” certified in two key scarce skills, scheduled according to predicted daily peaks.

5. SIMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, & MONITORING
-------------------------------------------------------
Simulation before rollout
1. Import discovered BPMN model with performance annotations into a discrete-event simulator (e.g., AnyLogic, Celonis EMS simulator).  
2. Parameterise resources: shift calendars, skill matrix, service-time distributions, arrival patterns.  
3. Create scenarios:  
   S0 Current state (baseline),  
   S1 Skill-based routing,  
   S2 + workload balancing,  
   S3 + predictive categorisation.  
4. Run 1-year Monte-Carlo replications; compare KPIs: SLA-breach %, mean resolution, utilisation variance, specialist idle/overwork.  
5. Choose configuration that yields highest benefit / lowest implementation cost.

Implementation roadmap (high level)
• Clean & enrich skill data  configure routing rules.  
• Integrate live event feed from ITSM tool into assignment engine.  
• Pilot on one major category (e.g., Network tickets) for 4 weeks.  
• Collect feedback, adjust thresholds, then roll out globally.

Ongoing monitoring with process-mining dashboards
Dashboards refreshed hourly from live event logs:  
1. SLA Panel  
   – SLA hit/miss by priority & category, trend vs. baseline.  
2. Reassignment Funnel  
   – Distribution of #reassignments; drill-down by skill & dispatcher.  
3. Utilisation & Workload Heatmap  
   – Real-time queue lengths, utilisation per agent/tier.  
4. Skill Utilisation/Over-qualification Index.  
5. FCR & Escalation Trend for L1.  
6. Alerting rules: e.g. if waiting time for any Required Skill >X min or utilisation of scarce skill >90 % for >1 h.

Weekly / monthly review
• Compare simulation predictions with live KPIs; recalibrate routing weights.  
• Perform “conformance checking” to ensure process variants induced by new logic still respect governance (e.g., no direct L1L3 skips unless emergency).  
• Feed newly logged data back into ML model to keep prediction accuracy high.

Result: a closed, data-driven loop—discover  analyse  simulate  implement  monitor—that continuously optimises TechSolve’s resource assignment, reduces SLA breaches, and utilises specialist talent where it delivers the most value.
