To identify the root causes of performance issues in the process based on the provided directly-follows graph, we can follow these steps:

1. **Frequency and Duration Analysis**: Analyze events with the highest frequency and the longest durations, as these could indicate bottlenecks or areas of high demand.

2. **Sequential Event Analysis**: Sequentially analyze the events between object types to identify potential delays or failures that might cause the longest durations.

3. **Frequency per Object Analysis**: For each object type, examine events related to that object type to understand how often they occur and if their frequency contributes significantly to the overall process performance.

### Key Insights from the Analysis:

1. **Duration Analysis**:
   - **"pay order"** events have durations that are significantly long in multiple object types (e.g., employees, orders), with both frequency and duration being high. This could indicate that payment processes or handling by employees are a bottleneck affecting other operations.
   - **"send package"** tends to have high frequencies but shorter, varied durations when closing an order (packages), suggesting issues might be more around the dispatch process rather than those around the creation of packages themselves (high frequency, longer durations).

2. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - **"place order"** (high frequency in multiple object types) might be an area where excess demand is forcing the system to handle higher transaction overhead, even though durations are relatively low except for when an order gets **"confirmed order"** (two longer durations). This suggests that confirmation might be a delay point for high-order volumes.
   - **"pick item"** instances show high frequency but varied durations, indicating potential stock issues or operational bottlenecks especially when items are **"out of stock"** (indicated by "item out of stock" -> "reorder item" sequence).

3. **Sequential Event Analysis**:
   - **"pay order"** -> **"confirm order"** -> **"place order"** sequence demonstrates that while pay-order issues might impact confirm-orders and subsequently placing new orders.
   - **"create package"** -> **"send package"** linking combines high-frequency package creation and dispatch, with the longer duration suggesting initiative focus areas for efficiency improvement.

### Recommendations for Addressing Performance Issues:

1. **Payment Process Optimization**: Investigate the **"pay order"** steps for inefficiencies or long waiting times, possibly by exploring automated payment solutions or optimized manual payment processes.

2. **Stock Management**: Address **"item out of
