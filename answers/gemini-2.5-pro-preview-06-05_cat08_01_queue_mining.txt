**Subject:** Data-Driven Approach to Optimizing Patient Flow and Reducing Waiting Times

### **Executive Summary**

This document outlines a systematic approach to address the reported patient waiting times and improve overall visit efficiency. By leveraging the clinic's existing event log data through process mining and queue mining techniques, we can move from anecdotal complaints to data-driven insights. The following plan details how we will identify critical queues, diagnose their root causes, propose targeted optimization strategies, and establish a framework for continuous monitoring and improvement. Our goal is to significantly enhance the patient experience and throughput while carefully managing operational costs and maintaining the highest standards of care.

### **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

The first step is to transform raw event log data into a clear, quantifiable picture of the waiting times within the patient journey.

**A. Calculating Waiting Times (Queue Times)**

In the context of this event log, **waiting time** is defined as the idle period between the completion of one activity and the start of the next consecutive activity for the same patient (case).

Using the provided data structure, the calculation is straightforward:
`Waiting Time for Activity 'B' = (Timestamp_START of Activity 'B') - (Timestamp_COMPLETE of Activity 'A')`

For example, for patient `V1001`, the waiting time for the "Nurse Assessment" is:
`09:15:20 (Start of Nurse Assessment) - 09:08:45 (Complete of Registration) = 6 minutes and 35 seconds.`

We will apply this calculation systematically for every transition between activities across all patient visits in the six-month dataset. This will create a comprehensive map of every queue in the process.

**B. Key Queue Metrics**

To understand the nature and severity of each queue, we will calculate the following metrics:

*   **Average (Mean) Waiting Time:** The overall average time patients spend in a specific queue. Useful for a high-level view but can be skewed by extreme outliers.
*   **Median Waiting Time:** The 50th percentile; half of the patients wait less than this time. This is often more representative of the "typical" patient experience than the mean.
*   **90th/95th Percentile Waiting Time:** The time that 90% or 95% of patients wait less than. This metric is crucial for understanding the worst-case experiences and for setting service level objectives (e.g., "Ensure 90% of patients wait less than 20 minutes for a doctor").
*   **Maximum Waiting Time:** Identifies the most extreme delays, which often lead to the most severe patient complaints.
*   **Queue Frequency (Count):** The total number of times patients entered a particular queue. A queue with a moderate wait time but extremely high frequency can have a greater cumulative impact than a very long but rare queue.
*   **Cases with Excessive Waits:** A count of patients who breached a predefined threshold (e.g., waiting more than 30 minutes), which helps quantify the scale of the problem.

**C. Identifying the Most Critical Queues**

Not all queues are created equal. We will prioritize our focus using a multi-factor approach:

1.  **Impact Score:** We will calculate an `Impact Score = (Average Waiting Time) x (Queue Frequency)`. This score prioritizes queues that are both long and common, representing the largest total "lost time" in the system.
2.  **Downstream Effect:** Queues early in the process (e.g., "Wait for Nurse Assessment") are often more critical because they create a cascading delay for all subsequent activities.
3.  **Patient Urgency:** We will filter the analysis for patients marked as "Urgent." Any significant waiting time for this cohort represents a potential clinical risk and must be prioritized, regardless of its overall average.
4.  **Patient Type:** We will compare waits for "New" vs. "Follow-up" patients. If new patients face exceptionally long waits at registration, it could be a key driver of dissatisfaction for this important group.

The queues with the highest impact scores, those affecting urgent patients, and those occurring early in the process will be marked as **critical** and targeted for immediate root cause analysis.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis**

Once we know *where* the longest queues are, we must understand *why* they exist. Process mining provides powerful tools to diagnose the underlying causes.

*   **Resource Bottlenecks:**
    *   **Analysis:** We will analyze resource utilization by calculating the total "busy" time (`COMPLETE` - `START`) for each resource (staff, room, equipment). Resources with utilization rates approaching 100% are bottlenecks. Furthermore, we can create a timeline visualization showing when multiple patients are simultaneously waiting for the same busy resource (resource contention).
    *   **Hypothesis:** The long wait before "Doctor Consultation (Cardio)" may be due to Dr. Smith being consistently overbooked, or the one ECG room being occupied continuously between 10 AM and 1 PM.

*   **Activity Dependencies and Handovers:**
    *   **Analysis:** Using **variant analysis**, we will compare the different paths patients take. Some paths may be inherently inefficient. For example, we might discover a variant where patients are sent for blood tests *after* seeing the doctor, requiring them to wait again for a final review, while a more efficient variant has them do the test beforehand.
    *   **Hypothesis:** The process flow for patients requiring both a consultation and a diagnostic test is not standardized, leading to unnecessary waiting loops.

*   **Variability in Activity Durations:**
    *   **Analysis:** We will analyze the distribution of activity durations (service times). High variability in a specific activity (e.g., "Nurse Assessment") can disrupt the flow for everyone downstream. If some assessments take 5 minutes and others take 30, it becomes impossible to schedule subsequent steps effectively.
    *   **Hypothesis:** The lack of a standardized triage protocol during Nurse Assessment leads to high service time variability, making the doctor's schedule unpredictable and causing patient backlogs.

*   **Appointment Scheduling and Arrival Patterns:**
    *   **Analysis:** We will create a **heatmap** of patient arrivals by day of the week and time of day. This will instantly reveal if scheduling policies are creating demand peaks that overwhelm the clinic's capacity (e.g., a huge influx of patients every Monday at 9 AM).
    *   **Hypothesis:** The policy of booking multiple patients for the same 9:00 AM slot creates an immediate registration and triage bottleneck that persists for hours.

### **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

Based on the root cause analysis, we can propose targeted, evidence-based interventions.

**Strategy 1: Implement Staggered Scheduling and Dynamic Staffing**

*   **Target Queue(s):** Wait for Registration, Wait for Nurse Assessment.
*   **Root Cause Addressed:** Patient arrival patterns creating demand peaks.
*   **Proposal:**
    1.  Replace the "block" scheduling system with a staggered one, offering appointment slots every 10 or 15 minutes to smooth the arrival curve.
    2.  Use the arrival heatmap data to re-allocate staff. If the peak is from 9 AM to 11 AM, schedule an additional registration clerk and triage nurse exclusively for that window, potentially by shifting their lunch breaks or start times.
*   **Data Support:** The patient arrival heatmap will clearly justify the need. We can simulate the effect of a smoother arrival curve on the queue, showing a projected reduction in wait times.
*   **Potential Impact:** We project this could reduce the average wait time for Nurse Assessment during peak hours from a current high of 28 minutes to under 15 minutes.

**Strategy 2: Create Differentiated "Fast-Track" and "Complex-Care" Patient Flows**

*   **Target Queue(s):** Wait for Doctor Consultation, Wait for Check-out.
*   **Root Cause Addressed:** Mixing of simple, quick visits with long, complex visits, causing congestion for everyone.
*   **Proposal:**
    1.  Identify patient visit types that are consistently short and predictable (e.g., prescription refills, routine blood pressure checks, simple follow-ups) using activity duration analysis from the event log.
    2.  Create a dedicated "Fast Track" flow for these patients, staffed by a Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant. This track would have a simplified process (e.g., quick assessment, e-prescription, simplified check-out).
*   **Data Support:** Analysis shows that 30% of visits are for a single, low-acuity purpose and last less than 20 minutes in total service time, yet these patients experience an average of 45 minutes of waiting.
*   **Potential Impact:** This could reduce the overall visit duration for this 30% cohort by 50% or more. Critically, it would also decongest the primary queue, reducing wait times for the complex-care patients who require more of the specialists' time.

**Strategy 3: Parallelize Diagnostic Testing with Doctor Wait Times**

*   **Target Queue(s):** Wait for Diagnostic Test (e.g., ECG, X-Ray), Wait for Doctor Consultation.
*   **Root Cause Addressed:** Inefficient, sequential process flow (Activity Dependencies).
*   **Proposal:**
    1.  For specific specialties and patient types (e.g., cardiology follow-ups), empower nurses to initiate standard, protocol-driven diagnostic tests (like an ECG) *immediately after* the initial assessment.
    2.  The patient can have the test done *while they are already in the queue waiting for the doctor*. The test results can be uploaded to the EMR and be ready for the physician when the consultation begins.
*   **Data Support:** Variant analysis shows that the path `Nurse -> Wait -> Doctor -> Wait -> ECG -> Wait -> Final Consult` has an average duration 40 minutes longer than a theoretical parallel path.
*   **Potential Impact:** This could virtually eliminate the "Wait for Diagnostic Test" queue for a significant number of patients and reduce the overall visit duration by 15-20 minutes for that cohort.

### **4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints**

Implementing these changes requires careful consideration of their potential consequences.

*   **Shifting Bottlenecks:** Fixing the registration queue (Strategy 1) might overload the diagnostic labs. We must analyze the entire process to anticipate where the new bottleneck will appear and plan accordingly.
*   **Cost vs. Benefit:** Dynamic staffing (Strategy 1) may increase payroll costs. We must weigh this against the financial benefits of higher patient throughput and satisfaction. The "Fast Track" model (Strategy 2) may be a lower-cost way to achieve similar results.
*   **Staff Workload and Change Management:** Redesigned flows (Strategies 2 & 3) require staff training, clear protocols, and buy-in. A poorly implemented "Fast Track" could lead to staff burnout or mis-triaged patients. We must involve clinical staff in the design process.
*   **Quality of Care:** The primary directive is to maintain or improve care quality. Parallelizing tests (Strategy 3) must be governed by strict clinical protocols to avoid unnecessary procedures. The goal is to reduce *unproductive* waiting, not to rush clinical activities.

**Balancing Act:** We will use simulation based on the process mining model to test these strategies virtually before a live pilot. This allows us to find a balance—for example, determining the optimal number of "Fast Track" slots that reduces overall waits without compromising care for complex cases.

### **5. Measuring Success and Continuous Improvement**

Improvement is not a one-time project but a continuous cycle.

**A. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Monitoring:**

We will track a balanced set of KPIs on an ongoing basis:

*   **Patient Flow KPIs:**
    *   **Overall Visit Duration:** (Time from first Registration event to last Check-out event). Track Mean, Median, and 90th percentile.
    *   **Waiting Time per Critical Queue:** Track Mean, Median, and 90th percentile for the specific queues we targeted.
*   **Efficiency KPIs:**
    *   **Resource Utilization:** Track key staff and equipment utilization to ensure they are busy but not overloaded.
    *   **Patients per Hour/Day:** Monitor overall clinic throughput.
*   **Quality & Satisfaction KPIs:**
    *   **Patient Satisfaction Scores:** (Specifically questions related to waiting time).
    *   **"Left Without Being Seen" Rate:** A critical indicator of extreme dissatisfaction.
*   **Cost KPIs:**
    *   **Cost per Visit:** (Factoring in staffing and resource costs).

**B. Ongoing Monitoring:**

We will establish an automated **Process Monitoring Dashboard**. This dashboard will be fed by the same event log data source and will update daily or weekly, providing near real-time visibility into the KPIs. We will set performance targets and automated alerts to notify management if a KPI (e.g., "Wait for Doctor") exceeds its threshold, enabling swift corrective action. This transforms process mining from a one-time analytical project into a permanent operational management tool.
