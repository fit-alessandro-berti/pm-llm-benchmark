Certainly! Here's a consolidated, well-structured BPMN-like textual process model of the invoice approval workflow inferred from the interviews. I explicitly list roles, activities, sequence flow, gateways, artifacts, exceptions, and indicate ambiguity where stakeholder accounts diverge.

---

### Participants / Pools & Lanes:
- **Supplier (External)**
- **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk (Mary)**
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**
  
---

### Process Start:
**Start Event:** Invoice received from Supplier (usually via email)  handled by AP Clerk.

---

### Activities, Sequence Flow, Gateways, Artifacts:

1. **AP Clerk: Receive Invoice**

   - **Artifact:** Supplier invoice (may/may not include Purchase Order (PO) number).
   - If invoice **does not have a PO number**:
   
     - **AP Clerk:** Sends invoice back / requests missing PO from supplier.
     - **Supplier Relationship Manager** may assist by requesting PO from Supplier.
     - **Gateway (Exclusive):**
       - When PO is supplied, re-enter process at Step 2.
       - If PO remains missing or invoice unrelated to any PO (e.g., informal service invoices):
         - **Escalate** to AP Supervisor (Rita)  **Exception path A** below.
   
   - If invoice **has PO number**:
     - Proceed to **Step 2**.
   
---

2. **AP Clerk: Log invoice into accounting system**

   - **Artifact:** Invoice record created in system; linked with PO where applicable.
   
---

3. **AP Clerk: Send invoice to Purchasing Officer**

   - **Trigger:** Successful logging with PO information.

---

4. **Purchasing Officer: Verify goods/services receipt and invoice details**

   - **Artifacts:** Invoice, PO, Goods Receipt records.
   - **Action:**
     - Compares quantities, prices, delivery charges.
     - Confirms goods/services received.
   - **Gateway (Exclusive):**
     - **If invoice details match PO and goods received:**
       - **Send confirmation email** to AP Clerk.
       - Proceed to **Step 5**.
     - **If discrepancies exist (incorrect pricing, quantities, missing info):**
       - Contact Supplier or ask AP Clerk to hold invoice.
       - May involve **Supplier Relationship Manager** for clarifications.
       - **Decision point:**
         - **If discrepancy resolved:**
           - Send confirmation — proceed to **Step 5**.
         - **If unresolved/cannot match PO:**
           - Purchasing informs AP Clerk to escalate.
           - **Escalate to AP Supervisor (Exception path B)**.
       - **If missing PO:** request AP Clerk to obtain before proceeding.
   
---

5. **AP Clerk: Match Invoice line items against PO**

   - **Artifact:** Invoice and PO records in system.
   - Confirms consistency based on confirmation from Purchasing.
   
   - **Gateway (Exclusive):**
     - **If match confirmed:**
       - Proceed to **Step 6**.
     - **If mismatch when matching:**
       - Clarify with Purchasing.
       - If no easy resolution, escalate to AP Supervisor (Exception path B).
   
---

6. **AP System: Automatically notify Department Manager**

   - **Trigger:** Successful confirmation and matching.
   - **Artifact:** Notification email with invoice, PO, and confirmation info.
   
---

7. **Department Manager: Review and Approve Invoice**

   - Reviews detail for budget alignment and correctness.
   
   - **Gateway (Exclusive):**
     - **If approved:**
       - **Send approval via system** — proceed to **Step 8**.
     - **If rejected or questions arise:**
       - Requests AP Clerk to **hold invoice and investigate**.
       - Invoice status moves to suspended until issues cleared.
       - **If concern persists after investigation:**
         - Potentially escalate to AP Supervisor (Exception path C).
   
---

8. **AP Clerk: Schedule Invoice for Payment**

   - **Artifact:** Approved invoice ready for payment run.
   - **Process End Event:** Invoice included in payment cycle.
   
---

### Exception / Variation Paths:

- **Exception Path A:** **No PO available for invoice (informal or missing PO)**  
  - AP Clerk escalates to AP Supervisor (Rita).
  - Supervisor works with Department Heads to:
    - Create a retrospective PO, or
    - Decide to **reject** the invoice.
  - After PO issue resolution, invoice re-enters standard flow at **Step 2 or 4**.

- **Exception Path B:** **Discrepancies or data issues unresolved**  
  - Escalation to AP Supervisor.
  - Supervisor coordinates with:
    - Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen),  
    - Supplier,  
    - Purchasing, and  
    - Departments.  
  - Objective is to resolve discrepancies (pricing, quantities, missing delivery, etc.).
  - Once corrected info is obtained or decision reached, invoice returns to **Step 4** for confirmation.

- **Exception Path C:** **Manager rejects invoice**  
  - Manager requests hold for additional investigation by AP Clerk.
  - May involve AP Supervisor if complex.
  - After investigation and corrections, manager re-reviews (return to **Step 7**).

---

### Summary Notes / Ambiguities:

- The workflow is strongly **PO-driven**; invoices without POs are treated as exceptions needing supervisor and department intervention.
- **AP Supervisor does not do approvals**, but mediates exception handling.
- Both **Purchasing** and **Manager approval** precede payment scheduling.
- The **Purchasing step** includes not only confirming receipt of goods/services but involves detailed verification against the PO.
- The **Manager is the final approver** before payment scheduling.
- Sometimes **Purchasing contacts suppliers directly**, but other times requests AP to hold; escalation triggers vary.
- It is somewhat unclear whether invoice matching by AP occurs before or after Purchasing confirmation — interviews suggest a two-layer check with matching after Purchasing confirmation but this may overlap.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** is a support role assisting in issue resolution, not a formal process owner.

### High-Level Process Sequence Recap:

**Start:** Supplier sends invoice   
(PO check)   
 if missing: request PO / escalate  
 if present: log invoice   
send to Purchasing   
Purchasing confirms goods received & PO/invoice match   
AP matches invoice lines to PO   
if match, request Department Manager approval   
Manager approves   
AP schedules payment   
**End.**
