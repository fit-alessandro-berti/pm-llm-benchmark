### Identified Anomalies and Hypotheses

Based on the analysis of the event logs, several anomalies and undesirable behaviors were identified:

1. **Out-of-Order Activities**  
   - **Case 1002**: `Confirm Shipment` and `Ship Goods` occur before `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock`.  
     *Hypothesis*: System error allowing shipment bypass or policy violation by logistics staff due to pressure to meet deadlines.  
   - **Case 1003**: `Ship Goods` occurs before `Confirm Shipment`, and `Confirm Shipment` happens after `Ship Goods`.  
     *Hypothesis*: Manual override by logistics staff or system glitch where shipment confirmation was backdated.  
   - **Case 1004**: `Receive Payment` occurs before `Issue Invoice`.  
     *Hypothesis*: Fraudulent activity (e.g., fake payment recording) or system error in payment processing.

2. **Missing Critical Activities**  
   - **Case 1003**: Missing `Validate Stock` and `Confirm Shipment` until after `Ship Goods`.  
     *Hypothesis*: Warehouse staff skipped stock validation due to time constraints or system failure to log steps.  
   - **Case 1004**: Missing `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock`.  
     *Hypothesis*: Credit/stock checks waived for "trusted" customers or system failure to trigger mandatory steps.

3. **Unusual Timing**  
   - **Case 1004**: `Receive Payment` occurs immediately after `Register Order` (5 minutes).  
     *Hypothesis*: Pre-authorized payments or manual data entry error.  
   - **Case 1002**: `Confirm Shipment` occurs immediately after `Register Order` (5 minutes).  
     *Hypothesis*: Automated shipment for priority orders or premature system triggers.

4. **Role Violations**  
   - **All Cases**: `Logistics Manager` performs `Confirm Shipment` (expected: `Logistics Manager`), but `Warehouse Staff` performs `Ship Goods` (expected: `Logistics Manager`).  
     *Hypothesis*: Role confusion or insufficient access controls in the system.

### Proposed SQL Queries for Investigation

#### 1. Identify Cases with Out-of-Order Activities
```sql
-- Find cases where activities violate the normal sequence
WITH activity_sequence AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id, 
    activity, 
    timestamp,
    LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT 
  case_id, 
  prev_activity, 
  activity, 
  timestamp
FROM activity_sequence
WHERE 
  (prev_activity = 'Register Order' AND activity NOT IN ('Perform Credit Check'))
  OR (prev_activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND activity NOT IN ('Validate Stock'))
  OR (prev_activity = 'Validate Stock' AND activity NOT IN ('Confirm Shipment'))
  OR (prev_activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND activity NOT IN ('Ship Goods'))
  OR (prev_activity = 'Ship Goods' AND activity NOT IN ('Issue Invoice'))
  OR (prev_activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND activity != 'Receive Payment')
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

#### 2. Detect Missing Activities
```sql
-- Identify cases missing critical activities
SELECT 
  o.case_id,
  o.order_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT l.activity) AS completed_activities,
  ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT l.activity) AS activities_done,
  ARRAY(SELECT unnest(ARRAY['Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 
                          'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment'])
        EXCEPT SELECT unnest(ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT l.activity))) AS missing_activities
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_event_log l ON o.case_id = l.case_id
GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_type
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT l.activity) < 7
ORDER BY o.case_id;
```

#### 3. Flag Unusual Timing Between Steps
```sql
-- Identify cases with abnormally short/long durations between steps
WITH step_durations AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp))) / 60 AS duration_minutes
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT 
  case_id,
  prev_timestamp,
  timestamp,
  activity,
  duration_minutes
FROM step_durations
WHERE 
  duration_minutes < 5   -- Suspiciously short (e.g., <5 minutes)
  OR duration_minutes > 1440  -- Suspiciously long (e.g., >24 hours)
ORDER BY duration_minutes;
```

#### 4. Validate Role Compliance
```sql
-- Check if activities were performed by authorized roles
SELECT 
  l.case_id,
  l.activity,
  l.resource,
  r.role AS actual_role,
  r.department,
  CASE 
    WHEN l.activity = 'Register Order' AND r.role != 'Sales Executive' THEN 'VIOLATION'
    WHEN l.activity IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment') AND r.department != 'Finance' THEN 'VIOLATION'
    WHEN l.activity IN ('Validate Stock', 'Ship Goods') AND r.role != 'Warehouse Staff' THEN 'VIOLATION'
    WHEN l.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND r.role != 'Logistics Manager' THEN 'VIOLATION'
    ELSE 'COMPLIANT'
  END AS compliance_status
FROM order_event_log l
JOIN resources r ON l.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE compliance_status = 'VIOLATION'
ORDER BY l.case_id, l.timestamp;
```
