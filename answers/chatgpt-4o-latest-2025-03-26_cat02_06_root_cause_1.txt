### **1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**

To identify which cases have longer resolution times, we calculate the duration from the **“Receive Ticket”** to **“Close Ticket”** for each case.

| Case ID | Start Time           | End Time             | Total Duration         |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00     | 2024-03-01 10:15     | **2 hours 15 min**     |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05     | 2024-03-02 09:15     | **1 day 1 hour 10 min**|
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10     | 2024-03-01 09:30     | **1 hour 20 min**      |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20     | 2024-03-02 08:30     | **1 day 10 min**       |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25     | 2024-03-03 09:30     | **2 days 1 hour 5 min**|

 **Long-duration cases are:**  
- **Case 102 (25+ hours)**  
- **Case 104 (24+ hours)**  
- **Case 105 (49+ hours)**

### **2. Root Cause Analysis for Delays**

#### **Key Observed Delay Factors:**

#####  **i. Escalations to Level-2 Agents**
- **Cases Involved**: 102, 105
- **Behavior**: All cases involving escalations experienced significant waiting times between escalation and final resolution.
    - **Case 102**
        - Escalated: 2024-03-01 11:30  Investigated next at 14:00 (2.5 hours wait)
        - Resolved: 2024-03-02 09:00  ~19 hours after investigation
    - **Case 105**
        - Escalated: 2024-03-01 10:00  Level-2 Investigation: 2024-03-02 14:00 (**28 hours wait**)
        - Resolved: 2024-03-03 09:00  ~19 hours after investigation

 **Observation**: Escalation adds ~20-40 hours to resolution time due to delay in re-investigation and processing.

---

#####  **ii. Delayed Investigations**
- **Case 104**
    - Received: 08:20  
    - Investigated: 13:00 (**~4.5 hours delay**)  
    - Resolved: Next morning at 08:00 (19 hours after investigation)
    
 **Observation**: Even without escalation, long delays between assignment and investigation cause a major increase in resolution time.

---

#####  **iii. Long Gaps between Activities**
- **Case 105**  
    - Escalation: 10:00 on 2024-03-01  Level-2 Investigation: 14:00 on 2024-03-02 (**28-hour delay**)  
    - Lengthy wait before action implies resource unavailability or process inefficiency.

---

### **3. Explanation of Factors Contributing to Longer Cycle Times**

**A. Escalations Significantly Increase Duration:**
- Delays between escalation and subsequent investigation are high—possibly due to Level-2 agent availability or prioritization protocols.
- Additional coordination or complexity may also play a role in slower resolution post-escalation.

**B. Bottlenecks Before “Investigate Issue” Stage:**
- Delays between assignment and investigation (e.g., Case 104, 4.5 hours) suggest capacity overload or task queuing is leading to idleness.

**C. Work Patterns Across Days:**
- Cases with activity spread across days (especially 102, 104, 105) show resolution happening the **next day**—indicating overnight inactivity in processing or shift-bound service windows.

---

### **4. Insights and Recommendations**

####  Insight 1: **Escalation Handling is a Major Bottleneck**
Delays post-escalation can be several hours to a full day.

> **Recommendation:**  
> - Introduce SLA targets or monitoring for post-escalation handling.
> - Increase Level-2 staffing or improve prioritization for escalated cases.
> - Consider partial handoff where Level-1 investigates while escalation is pending.

---

####  Insight 2: **Reduce Time Before First Investigation**
Early investigation leads to faster resolution (see Cases 101 and 103).

> **Recommendation:**  
> - Set strict KPIs for time from “Assignment” to “Investigation Start”.
> - Use workload-balancing or ticket-prioritization mechanisms.

---

####  Insight 3: **Avoid Overnight Delays through Extended Coverage**
Delays happen often when work is paused overnight or over shift breaks.

> **Recommendation:**  
> - Consider extending shift coverage or handover protocols between support teams.
> - Implement 24/7 coverage for escalation queues if issues are critical.

---

####  Insight 4: **Introduce Process Monitoring Dashboards**
Visibility into ticket age, stage, and ownership could allow proactive management.

> **Recommendation:**  
> - Track all ticket durations with real-time alerts for inactivity or SLA breaches.
> - Create dashboards segmenting cases by stage and delay reasons.

---

###  Summary

- **Delayed resolutions are mostly caused by escalations and inactivity between stages.**
- **Cases 102, 104, and 105** are outliers with delays between 24–49 hours.
- **Speeding up escalations and reducing intervening delays** (especially before re-investigations or overnight gaps) could sharply reduce cycle time.
- Implementing **additional staffing, SLA policies, and dashboards** would be valuable in improving ticket turnaround efficiency.
