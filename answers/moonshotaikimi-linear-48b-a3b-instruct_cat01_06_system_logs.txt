## Logic Explanation

### Case Identification:
I identified three distinct work-sessions that comprise Case_1:

1. **Document Drafting Session** (09:00-09:08): Focus on Document1.docx - This started with switching to Doc1, typing an intro, and ended with saving the quarterly report. This represents a continuous drafting session for a document.

2. **Email Response Session** (09:02-09:03): Focus on Gmail - The user composed and sent a response to an email about an Annual Meeting. This was a brief 40-second session.

3. **Budget Report Update** (09:04-09:06): Multitasking session across Excel and Word - The user accessed Excel to update budget figures, then referenced those figures in Document1.docx.

### Activity Standardization:
- **FOCUS events** were resolved based on the subsequent actions and application's primary purpose:
  - Word documents  "Edit [Document Type]"
  - Excel  "Update Budget Spreadsheet" or "Update Budget Structure"
  - Chrome (Email)  "Compose Email Response / Send Email"

- **SAVE/CLOSE operations** were attached to the last activity performed before saving/closing to maintain event sequence.

- **Crucial missing information** (like File Paths, Employee ID, Document Links) that would help identify cases were not present in the log, which constrained my case grouping decisions.

### Notable Observations:
- The user appears to have multiple documents open simultaneously (Document1.docx, Quarterly_Report.docx)
- The workflow shows typical business document creation patterns: drafting  referencing external data (budget)  saving
- The session boundaries reflect natural work segments rather than technical isolation points
- The conclusion of Case_1 with two consecutive saves (09:06:30 and 09:08:00) suggests the user intentionally persisted their work before ending the session
