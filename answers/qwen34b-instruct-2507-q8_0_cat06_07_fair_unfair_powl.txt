Certainly! Below are **two fully specified POWL models** based on your detailed description of the GlobalTeq Solutions hiring process. Each model reflects the structure described, but differs in how the **cultural fit and community affiliation check** is handled — one introduces a **potential source of bias**, the other **eliminates it entirely**.

We will use the correct POWL syntax and structure as per the provided instructions, using:
- `Transition(label="...")` for activities
- `OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[...])` for XOR choices
- `OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[...])` for loops
- `StrictPartialOrder(nodes=..., order=...)` to define the overall workflow with partial ordering
- Proper edges to represent execution dependencies

##  **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

This model includes an **XOR branch** at the cultural fit stage: one path goes through a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other leads to a **CommunityAffiliationCheck**, which gives a subtle advantage to applicants affiliated with the “Global Business Leaders Club” or local residents.

###  Key Features:
- After skill assessment, an XOR choice appears: either standard cultural fit or community-affiliation check.
- The community-affiliation check provides an implicit score boost — creating **unfairness**.
- The managerial review may then be influenced by this implicit advantage.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = SilentTransition()  # silent for loop continuation
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_standard = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness: if resume missing info, request more
loop_data = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check, request_info]
)

# XOR choice after skill assessment: either standard cultural fit or community check
xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[
        cultural_fit_standard,
        community_affiliation_check
    ]
)

# Build the root structure: all activities in a partial order
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        receive_app,
        loop_data,
        skill_assessment,
        xor_cultural,
        managerial_review,
        final_decision
    ],
    order={
        # Receive app  data loop
        receive_app: loop_data,
        # Loop  skill assessment
        loop_data: skill_assessment,
        # Skill assessment  cultural fit choice
        skill_assessment: xor_cultural,
        # Cultural fit choice  managerial review
        xor_cultural: managerial_review,
        # Managerial review  final decision
        managerial_review: final_decision
    }
)

# This model introduces a biased path (community_affiliation_check) that can lead to unfair advantage.
```

###  Why it introduces unfairness:
- The **XOR branch** allows applicants with community affiliations to bypass a neutral cultural fit evaluation and enter a **subjective, favorable path**.
- The `community_affiliation_check` activity has **no objective criteria**, and its inclusion implicitly biases the evaluation.
- The managerial reviewer may **consciously or unconsciously favor** applicants flagged in this branch due to perceived alignment with local interests or community values.
- This creates a **non-transparent, merit-irrelevant advantage** — violating fairness in hiring.

##  **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**

This model ensures **all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation**. There is **no XOR branch** involving community affiliations. The process remains fair and transparent.

###  Key Features:
- All applicants go through a **standard cultural fit check** after skill assessment.
- No special community-based evaluation path exists.
- The workflow is fully symmetric and merit-based.
- Loop for data completeness is preserved for completeness, but no bias is introduced.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = SilentTransition()  # loop continuation
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_standard = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness
loop_data = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check, request_info]
)

# All applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation (no XOR)
# This ensures fairness — no special treatment based on community affiliation

# Build the root structure
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        receive_app,
        loop_data,
        skill_assessment,
        cultural_fit_standard,
        managerial_review,
        final_decision
    ],
    order={
        receive_app: loop_data,
        loop_data: skill_assessment,
        skill_assessment: cultural_fit_standard,
        cultural_fit_standard: managerial_review,
        managerial_review: final_decision
    }
)

# This model removes the bias by eliminating the community-affiliation branch.
```

###  Why it is fair:
- Every applicant receives the **same evaluation path** after the skill test.
- The cultural fit assessment is **objective and uniform**.
- No applicant is advantaged based on local affiliations, memberships, or geographic ties.
- The process remains **transparent, consistent, and bias-resistant**.

##  Summary Table

| Feature | Unfair Model | Fair Model |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Cultural Fit Path | XOR: Standard OR Community Affiliation Check | Only Standard Cultural Fit |
| Community Affiliation Check |  Present (biased) |  Absent |
| Managerial Review Influence | May be biased by affiliation cues | Neutral, based only on merit |
| Fairness | Potential bias due to hidden advantage | Fully transparent and equitable |
| Loop for Data Completeness | Present | Present |
| Skill Assessment | Present | Present |
| Final Decision Path | Dependent on affiliation | Independent of affiliation |

##  Conclusion

These two POWL models accurately reflect the described hiring process, with one **highlighting a subtle bias** (via XOR branching to a community-affiliation check), and the other **removing that bias entirely**. 

By modeling the **presence or absence of the XOR branch**, we can formally represent and analyze how **unfairness can creep into automated hiring systems** — even when the process appears structured and transparent.

This approach enables stakeholders to:
- Detect bias in workflow design
- Evaluate fairness in recruitment pipelines
- Design equitable, audit-ready hiring processes

Let me know if you'd like a visual diagram (e.g., Mermaid.js or PlantUML) of either model, or to extend this with metrics for bias detection!
