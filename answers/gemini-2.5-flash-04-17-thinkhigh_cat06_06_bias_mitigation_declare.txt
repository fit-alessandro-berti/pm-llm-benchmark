# Rationale for added constraints:
# - existence: Added "CheckApplicantRace", "ManualReview", and "BiasMitigationCheck" to the list of potential activities in the process.
# - coexistence:
#     - "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}} - This constraint ensures that whenever the applicant's race is checked, a manual review activity must also occur within the same process instance. This helps prevent automated decisions solely based on sensitive attributes and requires a human check.
#     - "FinalDecision": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}} - This ensures that any final decision is accompanied by a manual review, further increasing scrutiny and potentially mitigating bias in the outcome.
# - response:
#     - "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}} - This mandates that if an applicant's race is checked, a "BiasMitigationCheck" activity must eventually occur in the trace after that event. This introduces a step specifically designed to identify and address potential biases before a decision is made.
# - succession:
#     - "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}} - This constraint ensures that if a "BiasMitigationCheck" occurs (which is triggered by a race check according to the 'response' constraint), the "FinalDecision" must follow the "BiasMitigationCheck". This prevents a decision from being made immediately after the race check without the bias mitigation step.
# - nonsuccession:
#     - "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}} - This constraint explicitly prevents the "FinalDecision" activity from directly following the "CheckApplicantRace" activity. This enforces that there must be at least one activity in between, preventing an immediate decision based on the sensitive attribute. Combined with the 'response' and 'succession' constraints, this forces the "BiasMitigationCheck" to occur before the "FinalDecision" if race was checked.

# How these constraints reduce bias:
# These constraints introduce mandatory steps and checks when sensitive attributes are involved. By requiring a "ManualReview" and a "BiasMitigationCheck" to coexist with or follow the "CheckApplicantRace" activity and the "FinalDecision", the model forces a more thorough and potentially fairer process. The non-succession constraint directly prevents immediate decisions after checking race, ensuring that other factors and a bias review are considered. This makes it harder for the process to make rapid, potentially biased decisions based on sensitive attributes.
