1. How does the company balance innovation speed in R&D with the risks of supply disruptions when sourcing cutting-edge components from multiple countries?  

2. In what ways could geopolitical tensions or export-control regulations in any supplier nation impact the continuity of component supply, and how can the firm build resilience against such shocks?  

3. How might fluctuating exchange rates across the various currencies involved affect total landed cost, and what hedging or pricing strategies could mitigate this volatility?  

4. What data-sharing agreements or digital platforms could be introduced to give all suppliers real-time visibility into demand forecasts without compromising sensitive intellectual property?  

5. Where are the biggest opportunities to shorten overall lead time—from design freeze to retail shelf—without sacrificing quality or compliance?  

6. How can advanced analytics or machine-learning models be refined to better predict regional demand surges for newly launched models, especially in emerging markets?  

7. What criteria should guide the decision between air freight and ocean shipping for different SKUs, and how does that trade-off influence carbon footprint and customer satisfaction?  

8. How effectively do current quality-control procedures detect latent defects originating from component fabrication, and what preventive measures could be added upstream?  

9. In regions with strict labor or environmental regulations, how does the company verify that its tier-2 and tier-3 suppliers are fully compliant, and what auditing mechanisms work best?  

10. What contingency plans exist for a sudden shutdown of the Malaysian assembly plant, and how quickly could secondary manufacturing sites be activated?  

11. How can just-in-time replenishment be balanced with the risk of stockouts in high-demand markets when global transportation networks are strained (e.g., due to pandemics or port congestion)?  

12. Which KPI—lead-time reduction, cost savings, or carbon-emission cuts—should take precedence when they conflict, and how can the organization align cross-functional incentives around that choice?  

13. How might circular-economy practices (such as component reuse or device refurbishment) be integrated into the existing supply chain without disrupting new product launches?  

14. What role could blockchain or other distributed-ledger technologies play in enhancing traceability of critical components and ethical sourcing claims?  

15. How do warranty-return data and repair statistics feed back into both design improvements and supplier performance evaluations?  

16. To what extent should the company localize inventory for e-commerce fulfillment versus leveraging centralized regional hubs, given varying last-mile logistics capabilities?  

17. How can collaboration with logistics partners be structured to share real-time customs-clearance data, thereby reducing delays and administrative costs?  

18. What are the potential impacts of introducing modular smartphone designs on assembly-line efficiency, supplier contracts, and consumer upgrade cycles?  

19. How might the firm quantify and justify investments in Scope 3 emissions reductions across such a distributed supply chain?  

20. What governance structure is needed to ensure continuous improvement initiatives are prioritized and resourced across all global sites, rather than being siloed within individual departments?
