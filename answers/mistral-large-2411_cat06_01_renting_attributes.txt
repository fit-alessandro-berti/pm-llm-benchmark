In the context of fairness, sensitive attributes are those that could potentially lead to unfair treatment or bias if used in decision-making processes. These attributes often relate to demographic characteristics that are protected by law or ethical considerations. Based on the provided attributes, the following are typically considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether an individual is a citizen or not. Discrimination based on citizenship status can be a sensitive issue, as it may lead to unfair treatment of non-citizens.

2. **case:gender**: Gender is a sensitive attribute because discrimination based on gender is illegal and unethical. Ensuring fairness often involves checking that decisions are not biased against any gender.

3. **case:german speaking**: Language proficiency, particularly in the context of a specific language like German, can be a sensitive attribute. Discrimination based on language skills can lead to unfair treatment of non-native speakers.

4. **case:married**: Marital status is another sensitive attribute. Discrimination based on whether someone is married or not can be unfair and is often protected by anti-discrimination laws.

These attributes are sensitive because they relate to characteristics that are often protected by law and are commonly associated with potential biases in decision-making processes. Ensuring fairness involves checking that these attributes do not unfairly influence outcomes or processes.
