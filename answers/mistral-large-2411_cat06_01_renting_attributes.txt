In the context of fairness in process mining, sensitive attributes are those that could potentially introduce bias or unfairness if they influence the process outcomes. These attributes typically relate to demographic characteristics or other factors that should not affect the decision-making process. Based on the provided attributes, the following are likely to be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether an individual is a citizen (True or False). Citizenship status can be a sensitive attribute because it may lead to unfair treatment if it influences decisions such as rental approvals or evictions.

2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual (True or False). Gender is a sensitive attribute because it should not influence decisions related to housing or any other process outcomes.

3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the individual is German-speaking (True or False). Language proficiency can be a sensitive attribute if it leads to biased treatment, especially in processes involving communication and documentation.

4. **case:married**: This attribute indicates the marital status of the individual (True or False). Marital status can be a sensitive attribute if it affects decisions related to housing, such as rental approvals or contract terms.

These attributes are sensitive because they pertain to personal characteristics that should not be used to discriminate against individuals in the process. Ensuring fairness involves monitoring and mitigating any potential biases related to these attributes in the decision-making process.
