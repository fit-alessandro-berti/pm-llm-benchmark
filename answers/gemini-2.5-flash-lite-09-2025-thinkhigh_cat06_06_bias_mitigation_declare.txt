This solution incorporates new constraints designed to enforce procedural fairness by linking sensitive attribute checks to mandatory mitigation steps and preventing direct, potentially biased transitions to final decisions.

For the purpose of mitigation, we assume the existence of the following activities related to bias handling: `CheckApplicantRace`, `BiasMitigationCheck`, `ManualReview`, and a decision outcome `Reject`.

### Updated DECLARE Model

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # --- New activities for fairness enforcement ---
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},

    },

### Rationale for Added Constraints

The additions are focused on creating mandatory procedural steps when sensitive information is processed, thereby reducing the opportunity for arbitrary or biased decisions:

1.  **`existence` Additions (Activities):**
    *   **Activities Added:** `CheckApplicantRace`, `BiasMitigationCheck`, `ManualReview`, `Reject`.
    *   **Rationale:** These activities are introduced to model the specific inputs (sensitive checks), required fairness steps (mitigation), and decision outcomes relevant to the bias mitigation strategy.

2.  **`coexistence`: `ManualReview` <-> `Reject`**
    *   **Constraint:** The `ManualReview` activity must coexist in the trace whenever a `Reject` activity occurs.
    *   **Rationale:** This ensures that any rejection, potentially influenced by sensitive data revealed earlier, is automatically audited or reviewed by a required human intervention (`ManualReview`), preventing automated or unchecked negative outcomes.

3.  **`response`: `CheckApplicantRace` $\rightarrow$ `BiasMitigationCheck`**
    *   **Constraint:** If `CheckApplicantRace` occurs, then eventually `BiasMitigationCheck` must occur later in the trace.
    *   **Rationale:** This enforces a dependency: processing sensitive applicant data *must* trigger a specific procedural step dedicated to fairness checks before the case can fully conclude.

4.  **`nonsuccession`: `CheckApplicantRace` $\ne \succ$ `Reject`**
    *   **Constraint:** The activity `CheckApplicantRace` cannot immediately precede the activity `Reject`.
    *   **Rationale:** This prevents an immediate, direct flow from identifying a sensitive attribute to making a negative decision. It forces at least one intermediate activity (ideally the required `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`) to occur between the check and the final decision, breaking the potentially biased direct causal chain.
