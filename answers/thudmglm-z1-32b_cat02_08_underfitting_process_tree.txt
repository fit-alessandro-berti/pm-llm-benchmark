**1. Problematic Trace:**  
`Receive_Order  Check_Inventory  Cancel_Order  Close_Order  Close_Order`

**2. Explanation:**  
The process tree model allows this trace because:  
1. The XOR node is not constrained by the result of `Check_Inventory`. The model permits choosing the cancel path (`Cancel_Order  Close_Order`) *even if inventory is sufficient*.  
2. After the cancel subtree, the root's `Close_Order` is redundantly executed, creating a duplicate `Close_Order`.  

**Domain Violation:**  
- According to the business rules, `Cancel_Order` should *only* be executed if the inventory is insufficient. If `Check_Inventory` confirms sufficiency (as implied by including this activity), the process *must* proceed with `Authorize_Payment  Package_Items  Ship_Order  Close_Order`, not cancellation.  
- The model fails to enforce the dependency between `Check_Inventory` and the XOR branch selection, allowing logically invalid branching.  

**Additional Example (Order Violation):**  
A trace like `Receive_Order  Check_Inventory  Ship_Order  Authorize_Payment  Package_Items  Close_Order` is also invalid but permitted by the model. Here, `Ship_Order` occurs *before* `Authorize_Payment` and `Package_Items`, violating workflow logic. The parallel operator (`PARALLEL`) in the successful subtree incorrectly allows out-of-order execution of these steps.
