## Analysis of Order Processing Event Log Anomalies

After examining the provided event log data, I've identified several significant anomalies and undesirable behaviors that deviate from the expected process flow. Let me analyze each case and propose SQL queries to investigate these issues further.

### Identified Anomalies

#### Case 1001: Normal Flow (Baseline)
This case follows the expected sequence perfectly, serving as our baseline for comparison.

#### Case 1002: Multiple Process Violations
- **Premature Shipment**: Activities occur out of sequence (Confirm Shipment  Ship Goods  Credit Check)
- **Risk**: Goods shipped before credit verification and stock validation

#### Case 1003: Missing Critical Step
- **No Stock Validation**: Process skips the "Validate Stock" activity entirely
- **Out-of-order Confirmation**: Shipment confirmation occurs after goods are shipped

#### Case 1004: Severe Process Breakdown
- **Payment Before Invoice**: Payment received immediately after order registration
- **Missing Activities**: No Credit Check or Stock Validation performed
- **Unusual Timing**: All activities compressed into 50 minutes

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **System Integration Issues**: Asynchronous systems may be logging events out of order
2. **Manual Override Practices**: Staff bypassing standard procedures for priority customers
3. **Training Deficiencies**: New employees unfamiliar with proper procedures
4. **Technical Failures**: System components failing to trigger required checks
5. **Fraud Risk**: Intentional bypassing of controls for certain transactions

### SQL Queries for Investigation

#### 1. Identify All Cases with Out-of-Order Activities
```sql
WITH expected_order AS (
    SELECT 
        activity,
        CASE activity
            WHEN 'Register Order' THEN 1
            WHEN 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
            WHEN 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
            WHEN 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
            WHEN 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
            WHEN 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
            WHEN 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
        END as expected_sequence
    FROM (VALUES 
        ('Register Order'),
        ('Perform Credit Check'),
        ('Validate Stock'),
        ('Confirm Shipment'),
        ('Ship Goods'),
        ('Issue Invoice'),
        ('Receive Payment')
    ) AS v(activity)
),
actual_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        e.case_id,
        e.activity,
        e.timestamp,
        eo.expected_sequence,
        LAG(eo.expected_sequence) OVER (PARTITION BY e.case_id ORDER BY e.timestamp) as prev_expected_seq
    FROM order_event_log e
    LEFT JOIN expected_order eo ON e.activity = eo.activity
)
SELECT 
    case_id,
    COUNT(*) as out_of_order_count,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) as actual_flow
FROM actual_sequences
WHERE expected_sequence < prev_expected_seq
GROUP BY case_id
ORDER BY out_of_order_count DESC;
```

#### 2. Find Cases Missing Critical Activities
```sql
WITH required_activities AS (
    SELECT * FROM (VALUES 
        ('Perform Credit Check'),
        ('Validate Stock')
    ) AS v(activity)
),
case_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(DISTINCT activity, ', ' ORDER BY activity) as activities_performed
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT 
    ca.case_id,
    o.order_value,
    o.customer_id,
    o.order_type,
    ra.activity as missing_activity
FROM case_activities ca
CROSS JOIN required_activities ra
LEFT JOIN order_event_log e ON ca.case_id = e.case_id AND e.activity = ra.activity
JOIN orders o ON ca.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE e.event_id IS NULL
ORDER BY o.order_value DESC;
```

#### 3. Analyze Timing Anomalies - Cases Processed Too Quickly
```sql
WITH case_duration AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        MIN(timestamp) as start_time,
        MAX(timestamp) as end_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp)))/60 as duration_minutes,
        COUNT(DISTINCT activity) as activity_count
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT 
    cd.case_id,
    cd.duration_minutes,
    cd.activity_count,
    o.order_value,
    o.order_type,
    cd.duration_minutes / NULLIF(cd.activity_count, 0) as avg_minutes_per_activity
FROM case_duration cd
JOIN orders o ON cd.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE cd.duration_minutes < 60  -- Cases completed in under an hour
   OR cd.duration_minutes / NULLIF(cd.activity_count, 0) < 10  -- Less than 10 min per activity
ORDER BY cd.duration_minutes ASC;
```

#### 4. Identify Payment Before Invoice Anomalies
```sql
WITH payment_invoice_timing AS (
    SELECT 
        p.case_id,
        p.timestamp as payment_time,
        i.timestamp as invoice_time,
        p.resource as payment_resource,
        i.resource as invoice_resource,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - i.timestamp))/60 as payment_before_invoice_minutes
    FROM order_event_log p
    JOIN order_event_log i ON p.case_id = i.case_id
    WHERE p.activity = 'Receive Payment'
      AND i.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
)
SELECT 
    pit.*,
    o.order_value,
    o.customer_id,
    o.order_type
FROM payment_invoice_timing pit
JOIN orders o ON pit.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE pit.payment_time < pit.invoice_time
ORDER BY pit.payment_before_invoice_minutes DESC;
```

#### 5. Resource Behavior Analysis - Identify Unusual Patterns
```sql
WITH resource_violations AS (
    SELECT 
        e.resource,
        r.role,
        r.department,
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.case_id) as cases_handled,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN e.activity = 'Ship Goods' 
             AND NOT EXISTS (
                SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log e2 
                WHERE e2.case_id = e.case_id 
                  AND e2.activity IN ('Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment')
                  AND e2.timestamp < e.timestamp
             ) THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
        END) as premature_shipments,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN e.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
             AND EXISTS (
                SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log e3 
                WHERE e3.case_id = e.case_id 
                  AND e3.activity = 'Ship Goods'
                  AND e3.timestamp < e.timestamp
             ) THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
        END) as late_confirmations
    FROM order_event_log e
    JOIN resources r ON e.resource = r.resource_id
    GROUP BY e.resource, r.role, r.department
)
SELECT *
FROM resource_violations
WHERE premature_shipments > 0 OR late_confirmations > 0
ORDER BY premature_shipments DESC, late_confirmations DESC;
```

#### 6. High-Risk Transaction Pattern Detection
```sql
WITH risk_indicators AS (
    SELECT 
        e.case_id,
        o.order_value,
        o.customer_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_credit_check,
        MAX(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_stock_validation,
        MIN(CASE 
            WHEN e.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND e.additional_info LIKE '%amount=%' 
            THEN CAST(SUBSTRING(e.additional_info FROM 'amount=([0-9.]+)') AS DECIMAL)
            ELSE NULL 
        END) as payment_amount,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(e.timestamp) - MIN(e.timestamp)))/3600 as process_duration_hours
    FROM order_event_log e
    JOIN orders o ON e.case_id = o.case_id
    GROUP BY e.case_id, o.order_value, o.customer_id
)
SELECT 
    case_id,
    order_value,
    customer_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN has_credit_check = 0 AND order_value > 1500 THEN 'HIGH'
        WHEN has_stock_validation = 0 THEN 'MEDIUM'
        WHEN process_duration_hours < 1 AND order_value > 2000 THEN 'MEDIUM'
        ELSE 'LOW'
    END as risk_level,
    CASE 
        WHEN has_credit_check = 0 THEN 'Missing Credit Check, '
        ELSE ''
    END ||
    CASE 
        WHEN has_stock_validation = 0 THEN 'Missing Stock Validation, '
        ELSE ''
    END ||
    CASE 
        WHEN process_duration_hours < 1 THEN 'Rushed Processing'
        ELSE ''
    END as risk_factors
FROM risk_indicators
WHERE has_credit_check = 0 
   OR has_stock_validation = 0 
   OR (process_duration_hours < 1 AND order_value > 2000)
ORDER BY order_value DESC;
```

#### 7. Department Handoff Analysis
```sql
WITH activity_handoffs AS (
    SELECT 
        e1.case_id,
        e1.activity as from_activity,
        e2.activity as to_activity,
        r1.department as from_department,
        r2.department as to_department,
        e1.timestamp as from_time,
        e2.timestamp as to_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp))/60 as handoff_minutes
    FROM order_event_log e1
    JOIN order_event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id 
        AND e2.timestamp = (
            SELECT MIN(timestamp) 
            FROM order_event_log e3 
            WHERE e3.case_id = e1.case_id 
              AND e3.timestamp > e1.timestamp
        )
    JOIN resources r1 ON e1.resource = r1.resource_id
    JOIN resources r2 ON e2.resource = r2.resource_id
)
SELECT 
    from_department || ' -> ' || to_department as department_flow,
    from_activity || ' -> ' || to_activity as activity_flow,
    COUNT(*) as occurrence_count,
    AVG(handoff_minutes) as avg_handoff_time,
    MIN(handoff_minutes) as min_handoff_time,
    MAX(handoff_minutes) as max_handoff_time
FROM activity_handoffs
GROUP BY department_flow, activity_flow
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;
```

### Key Findings Summary

These queries will help identify:
1. **Compliance violations** where critical checks are skipped
2. **Timing anomalies** suggesting automated or fraudulent behavior  
3. **Resource-specific patterns** indicating training needs or intentional bypasses
4. **High-risk transactions** requiring immediate attention
5. **Process bottlenecks** and inefficient handoffs between departments

The analysis reveals systemic issues requiring immediate intervention, particularly around credit checks and stock validation being bypassed for certain high-value orders.
