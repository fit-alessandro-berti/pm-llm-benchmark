### **Explanation of Added Constraints to Reduce Bias**

1. **`ManualReview` Existence**:  
   - *Rationale*: Ensures that any trace involving decisions on sensitive demographics includes a mandatory manual review, increasing transparency and accountability.

2. **`absence` of Direct Approval/Rejection for Sensitive Groups**:  
   - *Rationale*: Prohibits decision paths like `DirectApprove_Minority`, which could indicate automated or unreviewed decisions based on sensitive attributes.

3. **`responded_existence` and `response` for `BiasMitigationCheck`**:  
   - *Rationale*: If the process checks `ApplicantRace` or `ApplicantGender`, it must eventually (and preferably promptly) trigger a `BiasMitigationCheck`, ensuring fairness procedures are followed.

4. **`coexistence` between Fair Decisions and `ManualReview`**:  
   - *Rationale*: Links decisions involving minority or female applicants with a `ManualReview`, ensuring human oversight in potentially biased contexts.

5. **`nonsuccession` and `nonchainsuccession`**:  
   - *Rationale*: Prevents a decision (especially rejection) from immediately following a sensitive attribute check, eliminating the possibility of direct, unchecked bias influencing outcomes.

6. **`chainsuccession` Forbidden Links**:  
   - *Rationale*: Even stricter than `nonsuccession`, this ensures no immediate chain (i.e., direct succession) from `CheckApplicantRace` to `FinalDecision`, enforcing intermediate steps.

7. **`noncoexistence` of Direct Decisions and Manual Review**:  
   - *Rationale*: Ensures that if a decision is made without proper process (e.g., `DirectReject_Minority`), it cannot co-occur with a `ManualReview`, making such violations detectable.

### **Overall Impact**
These constraints collectively enforce **procedural fairness** in the loan approval process by:
- Requiring **human oversight** (`ManualReview`) for sensitive cases,
- Preventing **direct influence** of sensitive attributes on decisions,
- Mandating **bias mitigation steps** after accessing protected data,
- Making **biased pathways structurally invalid** in the process model.

This declarative enforcement ensures that any execution trace violating fairness norms is automatically considered non-conforming, supporting auditability and compliance with anti-discrimination policies.
