### Integrated Event Log (Case ID = `order_id`)
Each row is one event. Timestamps are in UTC (`Z`). Resource names/roles are looked up from the Resources table where available.

### Assumptions / Notes
- **Case concept**: `order_id` is the Case ID for all events; invoice/payment records are linked back to the order via `Invoice.order_id` and `Payments.invoice_id`.
- **Granularity**:
  - Each **order line** produces its own **“Item Picked”** event (using `item_picking_date`).
  - Each **delivery** produces two events: **“Order Dispatched”** and **“Order Arrived”**.
  - Each **invoice** produces one **“Invoice Issued”** event.
  - Each **payment** produces one **“Payment Received”** event.
- **Resources for payments**: no resource/actor is provided in the Payments table, so Resource fields are left blank for payment events (only method/reference are recorded as attributes).
- **Missing data**: Order **1004** has no delivery, invoice, or payment records; only observed events are included (no artificial “completed” events inferred).
