Below, I present two POWL models for the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, reflecting the described workflow. The first model includes a potential source of unfairness through an XOR branch for community affiliation checks, while the second model removes this branch to ensure fairness. I will use appropriate activity labels from the description and define the models using the POWL structure with sequences, loops, and choices as needed.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model includes an XOR branch after the skill assessment, where applicants can either go through a standard cultural fit evaluation or a community affiliation check that may provide a subtle advantage.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities as transitions with appropriate labels
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define a loop for data completeness check
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define an XOR choice for cultural fit evaluation (potential unfairness)
xor_cultural_fit = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the overall partial order with sequential execution
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_data_completeness, SkillAssessment, xor_cultural_fit, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the order (sequence of execution)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_completeness)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(loop_data_completeness, SkillAssessment)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_cultural_fit)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(xor_cultural_fit, ManagerialReview)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation of Model with Unfairness:**
- The process starts with `ReceiveApplication`, followed by a loop (`loop_data_completeness`) to ensure data completeness through `DataCompletenessCheck` and `RequestMoreInfo` if needed.
- After the loop, `SkillAssessment` evaluates the applicant's skills.
- Post-skill assessment, an XOR branch (`xor_cultural_fit`) allows for either a standard `CulturalFitCheck` or a `CommunityAffiliationCheck`. The latter may introduce bias by giving a subtle advantage to applicants with specific affiliations.
- Finally, `ManagerialReview` and `FinalDecision` complete the process in sequence.
- The XOR branch represents the potential unfairness, as it creates different evaluation paths based on community affiliation.

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness
This model removes the XOR branch for community affiliation, ensuring all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process, thus eliminating the potential for bias at that stage.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities as transitions with appropriate labels
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define a loop for data completeness check
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the overall partial order with sequential execution (no XOR for cultural fit)
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_data_completeness, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the order (sequence of execution)
root_fair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_completeness)
root_fair.order.add_edge(loop_data_completeness, SkillAssessment)
root_fair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root_fair.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_fair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation of Model Without Unfairness:**
- The process starts similarly with `ReceiveApplication`, followed by a loop (`loop_data_completeness`) for `DataCompletenessCheck` and `RequestMoreInfo` if needed.
- After the loop, `SkillAssessment` evaluates skills.
- Unlike the first model, there is no XOR branch. All applicants proceed directly to a single `CulturalFitCheck`, ensuring a uniform evaluation process without separate paths for community affiliations.
- The process concludes with `ManagerialReview` and `FinalDecision` in sequence.
- By removing the XOR branch and the `CommunityAffiliationCheck`, this model eliminates the potential source of bias, ensuring fairness in the cultural fit evaluation.

### Key Differences Between the Models
- **XOR Branch for Cultural Fit:** The first model (with unfairness) includes an XOR branch (`xor_cultural_fit`) that splits the process into `CulturalFitCheck` and `CommunityAffiliationCheck`, introducing a potential bias. The second model (without unfairness) removes this branch, using only `CulturalFitCheck` for all applicants.
- **Fairness Implication:** The removal of the `CommunityAffiliationCheck` in the second model ensures that no applicant receives a subtle advantage based on affiliations or local ties, aligning with a more equitable hiring process.

Both models maintain the loop for data completeness and the sequential nature of the hiring stages, but they differ critically in how they handle the cultural fit evaluation to address fairness concerns.
