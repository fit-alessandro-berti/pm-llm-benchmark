## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

### **1.1 Reconstructing Actual Job Flow Using Process Mining**
Process mining techniques (e.g., **Discrete Event Simulation (DES), Process Discovery, and Conformance Checking**) can reconstruct the actual flow of jobs from the MES event logs. Key steps include:

- **Process Discovery (e.g., Alpha Miner, Heuristics Miner):**
  - Extract the **actual routing paths** of jobs (e.g., Cutting  Milling  Lathing) and identify **alternative paths** (e.g., some jobs skip Grinding).
  - Detect **cycle times, waiting times, and bottlenecks** by analyzing timestamps between events.

- **Conformance Checking (e.g., using Process Trees or Petri Nets):**
  - Compare **planned vs. actual execution** to identify deviations (e.g., jobs taking longer than planned, unplanned delays).
  - Highlight **non-compliance** with due dates and prioritization rules.

- **Performance Mining (e.g., Time-Performance Analysis):**
  - Calculate **job flow times, lead times, and makespan** distributions.
  - Identify **queueing delays** at each work center by analyzing the time between "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" events.

### **1.2 Key Process Mining Techniques & Metrics**

| **Metric**                     | **Process Mining Technique**                          | **How to Extract from Logs**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Job Flow Time**              | Time-Performance Analysis                            | Difference between "Job Released" and "Task End" for each job.                                |
| **Lead Time Distribution**     | Statistical Analysis (Histogram, CDF)                | Aggregate flow times across all jobs, stratified by priority/due date.                       |
| **Task Waiting Times**          | Queue Analysis (e.g., Little’s Law)                  | Time between "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" at each machine.                                |
| **Resource Utilization**       | Utilization Analysis (Productive vs. Idle Time)      | Compare "Task Start" to "Task End" vs. "Breakdown" events.                                  |

### **1.3 Example Analysis Workflow**
- **Step 1:** Extract **job-level metrics** (flow time, tardiness) and **machine-level metrics** (utilization, queue times).
- **Step 2:** Use **variant analysis** to compare on-time vs. late jobs (e.g., do late jobs have longer setups at bottleneck machines?).
- **Step 3:** Apply **bottleneck analysis** (e.g., **Little’s Law: WIP = Throughput × Flow Time**) to identify machines with excessive queueing.
- **Step 4:** Model **setup time dependencies** using **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)** or **hidden Markov models** to predict optimal job sequencing.

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

### **2.1 Key Pathologies Identified via Process Mining**

| **Pathology**                          | **Process Mining Evidence**                                                                 | **Impact on KPIs**                          |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Bottleneck Machines (e.g., MILL-02)** | High queue times, low utilization spikes, frequent breakdowns.                            | Increased lead times, higher WIP.           |
| **Poor Prioritization**                | High-priority jobs delayed due to low-priority jobs occupying critical machines.         | Missed due dates, customer penalties.       |
| **Suboptimal Sequencing**              | Jobs with similar setups processed in inefficient orders (e.g., high setup time between dissimilar jobs). | Longer total setup times, reduced throughput. |
| **Starvation of Downstream Resources** | Upstream machines (e.g., Cutting) overloaded, causing downstream machines (e.g., Grinding) to starve. | Idle time at downstream machines, wasted capacity. |
| **Bullwhip Effect in WIP**             | Large fluctuations in WIP due to reactive scheduling (e.g., last-minute rush orders).     | Unpredictable lead times, high inventory costs. |

### **2.2 Diagnostic Techniques**
- **Bottleneck Identification:**
  - Use **throughput analysis** (e.g., **Theory of Constraints (TOC) approach**) to find machines where **WIP accumulates**.
  - **Process mining visualization** (e.g., **Process Trees**) to show where jobs get stuck.
- **Prioritization Analysis:**
  - Compare **on-time vs. late jobs** using **classification trees** (e.g., jobs with high setup times at bottlenecks are more likely to be late).
- **Sequencing Efficiency:**
  - **Cluster analysis** on job types to identify similar jobs that could be batched to reduce setups.
- **Disruption Impact:**
  - **Causal analysis** (e.g., **Granger causality**) to see if breakdowns at MILL-02 correlate with downstream delays.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

### **3.1 Key Root Causes**

| **Root Cause**                          | **Process Mining Insight**                                                                 | **Verification Method**                          |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Static Dispatching Rules**            | Jobs follow rigid FCFS or EDD rules without considering **dynamic machine loads** or **setup dependencies**. | Compare actual vs. simulated schedules using dynamic rules. |
| **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**        | No adaptive response to **machine breakdowns** or **priority changes** (e.g., JOB-7005). | Analyze how "Breakdown" events propagate delays. |
| **Inaccurate Setup Time Estimates**     | Setup times vary **significantly** based on previous job (e.g., JOB-6998  JOB-7001 takes 23.5 min vs. planned 20 min). | Use **historical setup time matrices** to model dependencies. |
| **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers** | No **cross-machine optimization** (e.g., balancing Cutting and Milling queues). | **Correlation analysis** between queue lengths at adjacent machines. |
| **No Predictive Maintenance Integration** | Breakdowns occur **without warning**, causing unplanned downtime. | **Failure prediction models** (e.g., survival analysis on breakdown logs). |

### **3.2 Differentiating Scheduling vs. Capacity Issues**
- **Scheduling Problems:**
  - **Evidence:** Jobs with similar processing times but **different tardiness** due to poor sequencing.
  - **Solution:** Use **reinforcement learning (RL)** to optimize job ordering dynamically.
- **Capacity Problems:**
  - **Evidence:** Machines **constantly overloaded** even with optimal sequencing.
  - **Solution:** **Expand capacity** (e.g., add a second MILL-02) or **subcontract** non-critical jobs.

## **4. Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

### **4.1 Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules**
**Core Logic:**
- Replace static rules (FCFS, EDD) with **weighted, multi-criteria dispatching** that considers:
  - **Remaining processing time (RPT)**
  - **Due date urgency (DDU)**
  - **Downstream machine load (DML)**
  - **Estimated sequence-dependent setup time (ESST)**

**Process Mining Insights Used:**
- **Historical setup time matrices** (e.g., if JOB-6998  JOB-7001 takes 23.5 min, avoid sequencing them consecutively).
- **Machine utilization patterns** (e.g., MILL-02 is overloaded at 3 PM, prioritize jobs that can finish before then).

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduces tardiness by 30%** (by avoiding high-setup-time sequences at bottlenecks).
- **Lowers WIP by 20%** (by balancing machine loads dynamically).

**Implementation:**
- Use **real-time MES data** to update weights (e.g., if MILL-02 is idle, prioritize jobs waiting there).
- **A/B test** against current rules using **discrete-event simulation (DES)**.

---

### **4.2 Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Machine Learning**
**Core Logic:**
- **Predictive lead times** using:
  - **Historical task duration distributions** (e.g., CNC Milling takes 60 ± 10 min, but varies by operator).
  - **Predictive maintenance models** (e.g., if MILL-02 has a 70% chance of breaking down in 2 hours, adjust schedules).
  - **Job similarity clustering** (e.g., jobs with similar routings can be batched to reduce setups).

**Process Mining Insights Used:**
- **Time-series forecasting** (e.g., **Prophet, LSTM**) to predict machine availability.
- **Job clustering** (e.g., **k-means**) to group similar jobs for batching.

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduces lead time variability by 40%** (better customer estimates).
- **Improves on-time delivery by 25%** (proactive rescheduling before breakdowns).

**Implementation:**
- **Train models** on MES logs (e.g., **XGBoost for setup time prediction**).
- **Integrate with MES** for real-time adjustments.

---

### **4.3 Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization via Intelligent Batching**
**Core Logic:**
- **Minimize sequence-dependent setups** by:
  - **Grouping similar jobs** (e.g., all "high-precision milling" jobs together).
  - **Using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)** model to optimize job sequences at bottleneck machines.

**Process Mining Insights Used:**
- **Setup time dependency graphs** (e.g., if Job A  Job B takes 15 min, but Job A  Job C takes 5 min, prefer Job C).
- **Historical routing patterns** to identify frequent job clusters.

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduces total setup time by 25%** (fewer transitions between dissimilar jobs).
- **Increases throughput at bottleneck machines by 15%**.

**Implementation:**
- **Run MILP solver** on historical data to find optimal sequences.
- **Deploy as a real-time optimizer** in the MES.
