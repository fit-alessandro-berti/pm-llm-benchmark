Yes, there are several anomalies identified based on the given dataset:

1. Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER immediately follows Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE occurrence numbers 4 and 5 times (0,1,2,3 positions). This could potentially be an error if SAVING the declaration should follow APPROVING it directly.

2. Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION appears unexpectedly after Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER occurrence number once when it should logically appear earlier in line.

3. There are several instances where Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE immediately follows Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER (`for`_occurrences 1, `, `for`_occurrences 6`) which suggests that the process might allow for a declaration to be rejected after approval (`REJECTION`) instead of the typical approval (`APPROVAL`) process flow (`ACCEPTANCE`) if this was meant.

4. Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER occurrence appears repeatedly (`for` occurrences positions not shown) after its own, suggesting there's a process error since it should logically appear before any other declaration APPROVAL or REJECTION (in the order given).

5. Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER (`for` occurrence position number unknown but seems to be somewhere in the middle of the model), followed by another BUDGETOWNER approval (`for` occurrence `2,3`) raises question about whether every declaration needs approval from them twice under normal circumstances.

6. The process flow assumes that 'for' occurrence immediately follows after some declarations, which isn't feasible given their logical order (`REJECTION`, `SUBMISSION`, `APPROVAL`, `REJECTION`, then `PAYMENT HANDLED`). 

7. Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER appears before the declaration's final approval by SUPERVISOR (`for` occurrences positions unclear).

8. The declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR and declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION follow the declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE occurrence once each indicating they should have followed immediately after an attempted save or save to a different user, which might not logically fit this scenario.

These anomalies are indicative of logical order errors in the process model's definition based on provided data inputs.
