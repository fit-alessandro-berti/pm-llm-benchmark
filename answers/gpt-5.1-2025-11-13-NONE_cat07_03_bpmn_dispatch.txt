The visualization is a BPMN-style process diagram that models how a company prepares and dispatches goods. It is organized in horizontal swimlanes representing roles/departments:

- **Dispatch of goods / Computer Hardware Shop Secretary**
- **Warehouse**
- **Logistics**

### Process flow (high level)

1. **Start – “Ship goods”**  
   The process begins in the Dispatch/Secretary lane.

2. **Clarify shipment method**  
   Using order details, the secretary determines how the goods should be shipped.

3. **Decision: “Special handling?”**  
   - **No:** The flow goes directly toward checking insurance.  
   - **Yes:** The secretary must:
     - **Get 3 offers from logistic companies**  
     - **Select logistic company and place order**  
     The result feeds into the later transport decision gateway.

4. **Check if insurance is required**  
   Customer information is consulted.  
   - If insurance is necessary, the process branches to **“Insure parcel”** in the Logistics lane, then rejoins the main flow.  
   - Either way, the parcel continues to **“Write package label”** (this task always happens).

5. **Gateway for transport decision**  
   After labeling, a gateway merges the normal-flow branch and the special-handling branch (where a logistics company was selected).

6. **Warehouse activities**  
   In parallel with the above office work, the Warehouse lane:
   - **Packages goods**  
     - If packaging takes more than **48 hours**, there is a timer event leading to **“Notify customer about delay.”**  
   - When packaging is finished, the flow joins with the logistics/secretary flow at a gateway.

7. **Final preparation**  
   After all prerequisites are satisfied:
   - **Fill out shipment paperwork**  
   - **Move package to pickup area**

8. **End – “Shipment prepared”**  
   The process ends when the package is ready in the pickup area.

Overall, the diagram shows coordination between office staff, logistics, and warehouse to ensure goods are packed, insured if needed, a carrier is chosen (especially for special handling), documents are completed, delays are communicated, and the shipment is prepared for pickup.
