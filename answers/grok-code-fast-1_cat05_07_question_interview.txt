Below is a list of targeted, open-ended questions I would ask the interviewee to clarify and deepen my understanding of their property onboarding process. I've organized them thematically for clarity, focusing on uncovering missing details, decision criteria, roles and responsibilities, timing and sequencing, and exception handling.

### Initial Contact and Documentation Review
1. Can you walk me through the most common reasons why a landlord's initial documentation might be incomplete or outdated, and how that impacts the overall timeline?
2. What specific criteria does the property coordinator use to decide whether to request updates from the landlord versus proceeding with what they have?

### Property Details Recording and Database Integration
3. Beyond the details you mentioned (like square footage and amenities), what other property attributes are typically recorded in the database, and how do these influence later decisions in the process?
4. How does the team ensure consistency and accuracy when entering property details across multiple regional offices?

### Property Manager Assignment and Introductory Meeting
5. Could you elaborate on the weighting of factors in assigning a property manager— for example, how much does workload versus geographic specialization typically outweigh experience with specific property types?
6. What are the key expectations that are usually aligned during the introductory call or meeting, and how do these discussions vary based on the landlord's unique requirements?

### Inspection, Repairs, and Marketing Preparation
7. In cases where the inspector identifies issues, what criteria determine whether the property manager handles repairs directly or escalates them to contractors?
8. How does the digital marketing team incorporate market trends into their pricing models, and what role does the property manager play in reviewing those updates?

### Tenant Screening, Selection, and Lease Finalization
9. Can you describe the typical sequence of steps in tenant screening, including how priority is given to applicants (e.g., for longer leases) and any trade-offs involved in negotiations?
10. What responsibilities does the property manager have versus the leasing agent during the tenant selection phase, and how do they collaborate if there are multiple interested tenants?

### Quality Checks, Audits, and Overall Process
11. How does the compliance officer's review of the lease integrate with the financial analyst's verification, and what happens if there's a discrepancy between them?
12. What are some examples of exceptions you've encountered in the process, such as properties needing special insurance, and how are these handled to keep the onboarding on track?
13. Overall, what are the most common bottlenecks in the timing and sequencing of these steps, and how does communication among stakeholders (like regional offices and support teams) help mitigate them?
