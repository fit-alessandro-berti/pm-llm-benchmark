The diagram is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) representation of a company's order fulfillment process, divided into four main pools: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. The Sales pool starts with checking the order for completeness every Monday morning, followed by verifying if the customer is in the database, and adding them if not. Order details are then sent to the Production pool, where production planning and manufacturing occur if materials are not faulty. Concurrently, the Procurement pool handles material ordering and checks, with a subprocess for material compensation if needed. Once the product is manufactured, it is sent to the Warehouse pool for dispatch. The diagram uses various BPMN elements such as tasks, gateways, events, and flows to illustrate the sequence and interaction between these processes, emphasizing the structured flow from order receipt to product delivery.
