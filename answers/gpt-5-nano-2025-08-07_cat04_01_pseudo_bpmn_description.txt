Here is a detailed, process-centered explanation of the pseudo-BPMN you posted, including the purpose of each step, the meaning of the gateways, how paths converge or loop, and how the standard vs. custom paths differ, plus under what conditions approvals or rework occur.

1) High-level overview
- The process handles two kinds of customer requests: standard and custom.
- It starts by receiving the request, then routes down different paths depending on the type.
- For standard requests, it runs parallel checks (credit and inventory), computes a delivery date, and then proceeds to an approval step if needed.
- For custom requests, it performs feasibility analysis, may either produce a custom quotation or reject the request, and then proceeds toward approval if required.
- After either path reaches the point of potential approval, if approval is required and granted, a final invoice is generated; if approval is not granted, the process reworks (re-evaluates) and loops back to the appropriate earlier step.
- Finally, a confirmation is sent to the customer and the process ends (or ends earlier if the request is rejected).

2) Step-by-step mapping and purpose

- Start Event
  - Marks the initiation of the process.

- Task A: "Receive Customer Request"
  - Collects the incoming request data (customer details, request type, specs, price/terms, etc.). This is the entry point for all downstream decisions.

- Gateway: "Check Request Type" (XOR)
  - A exclusive-choice decision point. Only one outgoing path will be taken based on the request type.
  - If the request type is Standard, take the Standard path.
  - If the request type is Custom, take the Custom path.
  - The XOR nature ensures you don’t proceed down both paths simultaneously.

- Path 1: Standard (through the Standard branch)
  - Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"
    - Validate the request against standard criteria (e.g., fits predefined product/service offerings, compliant data, pricing rules, etc.).
  - Gateway: "Run Parallel Checks" (AND)
    - Splits the path into parallel activities that can run concurrently to save time.
  - Task C1: "Credit Check"
    - Assess the customer’s creditworthiness or credit limit for the standard offer.
  - Task C2: "Inventory Check"
    - Verify availability or lead times for the requested standard item/service.
  - All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)
    - This join ensures both C1 and C2 are finished before moving on. It coordinates parallel tasks so that subsequent steps have the necessary combined data.
  - Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"
    - Uses results from the validation and checks to compute a feasible delivery date or ETA for the standard request.

- Path 2: Custom (through the Custom branch)
  - Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"
    - Evaluate whether the requested custom solution is technically and commercially feasible within constraints (e.g., technical risk, resources, timelines, margins).
  - Gateway: "Is Customization Feasible?" (XOR)
    - Exclusive decision: if feasible, proceed to E1; if not feasible, proceed to E2 (rejection).
  - If Yes (Feasible):
    - Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"
      - Create a tailored quote/offer for the customer, outlining specs, pricing, timelines, and terms.
  - If No (Not Feasible):
    - Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"
      - Notify the customer that the custom request cannot be fulfilled and terminate the path (End Event).

- After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed
  - Gateway: "Is Approval Needed?" (XOR)
    - Determines whether internal approval is required before proceeding to final invoicing.
    - If Yes: proceed to Task F; if No: proceed directly to Task G.
  - If Yes (Approval Required):
    - Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"
      - Submit the required information to the appropriate authority for approval.
    - Gateway: "Is Approval Granted?" (XOR)
      - Decide if the approval outcome is favorable or not.
    - If Yes (Approval Granted):
      - Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"
        - Issue the final invoice after the approval condition is satisfied.
    - If No (Approval Denied):
      - Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"
        - Reassess the situation based on the reasons for denial and determine next actions.
      - Loop back to:
        - For Custom Path: back to Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation) — i.e., rework the custom offer.
        - For Standard Path: back to Task D (Calculate Delivery Date) — i.e., adjust the delivery plan and re-evaluate.
      - This looping means the process can re-run the earlier steps to address the issues that caused the denial, before attempting approval again.
  - If No (Approval Not Needed):
    - Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"
      - Generate the final invoice without going through the approval step.

- Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"
  - Notify the customer of the outcome (e.g., invoice issued, or rejection/approval outcome) and provide necessary details.

- End Event
  - The process ends after sending the confirmation to the customer (successful completion).

- Special note on the E2 path
  - E2: "Send Rejection Notice" leads to its own End Event (distinct termination path) because the custom request is not feasible, so no further processing occurs.

3) Gateways: meaning and behavior
- XOR (Exclusive Gateway)
  - Only one of the outgoing paths is taken based on the evaluated condition.
  - Used to choose between Standard vs Custom, feasibility yes/no, approval needed vs not needed, and approval granted vs denied.
- AND (Parallel Gateway)
  - Splits the flow into parallel tasks that can execute concurrently.
  - The subsequent “Join” ensures that all parallel tasks complete before continuing.
- Join / Merge
  - After parallel tasks C1 and C2, the join ensures both results are available for D.
  - The final merge at "Is Approval Needed?" ensures that regardless of standard or custom path, the process flows through a common decision point before moving on.

4) How the paths converge and how looping works
- Convergence
  - After either B1/C1/C2 path (Standard) or B2/E1 path (Custom, upon feasibility), the flow reaches the common decision point: "Is Approval Needed?".
  - This convergence point standardizes what happens next, whether the request requires internal approval or can proceed to invoice generation.
- Looping (rework)
  - If approval is required and is denied, the process loops back to rework:
    - For Custom: back to E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation) to update the quotation in light of the denial reasons.
    - For Standard: back to D (Calculate Delivery Date) to adjust the delivery plan in light of the denial reasons.
  - This loop reflects a real-world rework path where an initial offer or delivery plan must be revised before retrying approval.
  - The loop continues until approval is granted or the conditions for rejection are met (i.e., for Custom, E2 might still be chosen if feasibility changes or other constraints dictate rejection; for Standard, the loop would continue until a viable plan is achieved or perhaps a different path is taken).

5) How tasks differ for standard vs. custom
- Standard path
  - Focuses on predefined, repeatable offerings.
  - Validation is about adherence to standard criteria.
  - Parallel checks (credit and inventory) are conducted to quickly assess risk and feasibility in parallel.
  - Delivery date is computed from standard assumptions.
  - Approval may be required, but the path emphasizes operational feasibility and standard terms.
- Custom path
  - Focuses on unique requirements that are not part of standard offerings.
  - Feasibility analysis is critical to determine whether custom work is viable.
  - If feasible, a custom quotation is prepared to reflect the bespoke terms, pricing, and timeline.
  - If not feasible, a rejection notice is sent and the process ends early (E2).
  - If approval is needed, it follows a stricter governance path (approval and potential rework on quotation), since bespoke work typically carries higher risk or price variance.

6) When approvals or rework are triggered
- Approval needed?
  - Triggered by organizational policy or risk/financial thresholds that require managerial sign-off before invoicing.
  - If No, the process moves directly to generating the final invoice (G).
  - If Yes, the process obtains manager approval (F) and then checks if approval is granted (G if granted; H for re-evaluation if denied).
- Rework (after denial)
  - Triggered when approval is denied (Is Approval Granted? = No).
  - Rework paths:
    - Custom: Loop back to E1 (prepare a revised Custom Quotation) and attempt approval again.
    - Standard: Loop back to D (recalculate or adjust the delivery date) and attempt approval again.
  - The loop ensures iterations can be performed to address the reasons for denial before re-requesting approval.

7) Practical implications and minor notes
- End-to-end flow: The final step is Task I (Send Confirmation to Customer) leading to the End Event, except when the E2 path (rejection) is taken which ends earlier.
- Data dependencies: The outcomes of C1 (Credit Check) and C2 (Inventory Check) feed into D (Delivery Date). For custom, feasibility results feed into whether E1 (Quotation) occurs.
- Decision points are explicitly modeled as XORs, ensuring mutual exclusivity of choices at those points.
- The diagram supports iterative negotiation: negative approvals lead to rework, which can extend the timeline but increase the likelihood of meeting approval criteria on the next attempt.

8) A concise example scenario
- Standard request: A customer requests a standard product.
  - A: Receive request  Standard type  B1 validates  C1 and C2 run in parallel  after both finish, D calculates delivery date  Is Approval Needed? (maybe Yes in this case)  F  G (if approved)  I (send confirmation)  End.
  - If approval denied, H re-evaluates conditions  loop back to D and retry approval after adjusting the plan.
- Custom request: A customer requests a bespoke solution.
  - A: Receive request  Custom type  B2 feasibility  If feasible  E1 prepares quotation  Is Approval Needed?  F  If approved  G  I  End.
  - If feasibility is No  E2 sends rejection notice  End.
  - If approval denied  H re-evaluates conditions  loop back to E1 (rework quotation) or potentially back to D if the path requires changing the delivery plan (depending on what the denial concerned).

If you’d like, I can map this to a clean BPMN diagram (with proper symbols) or provide a checklist of data elements and decision rules that would need to be defined to operationalize this process in a BPMN engine.
