# Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: A Comprehensive Approach

---

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### 1.1 Data Preprocessing and Integration

**Integration Strategy**

The fundamental challenge is unifying four heterogeneous data sources—each with different granularities, identifiers, and temporal resolutions—into a single, coherent event log conforming to the XES (eXtensible Event Stream) standard or equivalent tabular format. I would approach this in several phases:

**Phase 1 — Entity Resolution and Key Alignment**

Each source system uses overlapping but not identical identifiers. The GPS tracker identifies events by Vehicle ID and timestamp; the scanner adds Driver ID and Package ID; the dispatch system links Vehicle ID to a planned route with stop sequences; and maintenance logs reference Vehicle ID with date ranges. The first step is to establish a unified case notion. I recommend a **dual-case hierarchy**:

- **Primary Case ID: Vehicle-Day** (e.g., `V12-20241205`) — captures the full operational journey of one vehicle on one day, from depot departure to depot return. This is the unit of analysis for route-level performance.
- **Secondary Case ID: Package ID** (e.g., `P9876`) — captures the lifecycle of a single parcel from assignment through delivery (or failure and re-attempt). This enables parcel-level punctuality analysis.

A mapping table links packages to vehicle-days via the dispatch system's assignment records. Driver-vehicle assignments (which may change across days) are resolved by joining on Vehicle ID + date from the dispatch system.

**Phase 2 — Temporal Alignment and Event Harmonization**

GPS data arrives at sub-minute frequency (potentially millions of raw pings over six months), while scanner events are discrete milestones. I would:

1. **Downsample and enrich GPS data**: Rather than treating every GPS ping as an event, I would apply a segmentation algorithm to derive *meaningful state-change events* from the GPS stream:
   - **Stop Detection**: Identify clusters where speed drops below a threshold (e.g., <2 km/h) for more than a configurable duration (e.g., >60 seconds). Each cluster becomes an "Unplanned Stop" or is matched to a scanner event at the same approximate location and time.
   - **Traffic Delay Detection**: Identify segments where average speed falls significantly below the expected speed for that road segment (using historical or map data). These become "Traffic Delay" events with duration and location attributes.
   - **Travel Segments**: Summarize continuous movement between stops into single "Travel" events with attributes for distance, duration, average speed, and fuel proxy metrics.

2. **Fuse scanner events with GPS events**: Match scanner-recorded arrivals/departures with GPS-detected stops using spatiotemporal proximity (within, say, 100m and ±3 minutes). This cross-validates both sources and fills gaps—for instance, if a driver forgets to scan "Arrive Customer," the GPS stop detection can impute it.

3. **Integrate maintenance events**: Overlay maintenance log windows onto the vehicle-day timeline. An unscheduled repair beginning at 11:05 on a given day creates a "Maintenance Stop — Unscheduled" event within the corresponding vehicle-day case, with duration calculated from the maintenance log's start/end timestamps.

4. **Attach dispatch plan as case-level attributes**: The planned route (sequence of stops, planned times, assigned packages, customer time windows) becomes a set of case-level and event-level attributes on each vehicle-day case. This is critical for conformance checking later.

**Phase 3 — Data Quality and Enrichment**

- **Missing data handling**: GPS signal loss in tunnels or urban canyons can create gaps. I would flag and interpolate short gaps (<5 min) and mark longer gaps as "Signal Lost" events. Scanner events with implausible timestamps (e.g., "Delivery Success" before "Arrive Customer") would be flagged for manual review or reordered based on GPS corroboration.
- **Geospatial enrichment**: Reverse-geocode GPS coordinates to meaningful zones (neighborhoods, postal codes, road names). Attach road-type information (highway, urban, residential) to travel segments. Compute distances using actual road-network routing (not Euclidean).
- **Contextual enrichment**: Append weather data (rain, snow, temperature) from external sources by date and region, as well as day-of-week, holiday flags, and known local events that may influence traffic.

**Key Challenges**

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Clock drift** between systems (GPS vs. scanner vs. dispatch server) | Normalize all timestamps to a single timezone; cross-validate using matched events |
| **Granularity mismatch** (high-frequency GPS vs. sparse scanner events) | Abstract GPS into meaningful events; use scanner milestones as anchors |
| **Ambiguous stops** (driver pauses for personal reasons vs. delivery-related) | Correlate GPS stops with scanner events and planned stop locations; classify unmatched stops as "unplanned" with further subcategorization |
| **Multiple packages per stop** | Group packages sharing a delivery address into a single "stop" event with cardinality attributes |
| **Case notion complexity** | Maintain both vehicle-day and package-level case IDs with explicit linking |
| **Volume** (6 months × fleet size × sub-minute GPS) | Perform aggregation before importing into process mining tools; use event abstraction |

### 1.2 Process Discovery

With the integrated event log, I would apply process discovery in stages, moving from high-level to granular:

**Level 1 — End-to-End Vehicle-Day Process**

Using the vehicle-day case ID, I would apply an **Inductive Miner** (chosen for its guarantee of producing sound models and its ability to handle infrequent behavior gracefully) to discover the main process flow. The expected high-level process would look something like:

```
Start Shift  Load Vehicle  Route Assigned  Depart Depot  
  [Travel  Arrive Customer  (Delivery Success | Delivery Failed)  Depart Customer]*  
  Travel  Arrive Depot  Unload  End Shift
```

However, the *actual* discovered model will reveal:
- **Loops and rework**: Failed deliveries leading to re-attempts later the same day or packages returned to depot.
- **Interruptions**: Unscheduled maintenance stops, refueling, extended breaks, and detours.
- **Variability in sequence**: Some drivers may not follow the planned stop order.
- **Parallel or batched activities**: Delivering multiple packages at the same address/building.

I would also use the **Fuzzy Miner** for an initial exploratory visualization, especially useful given the expected spaghetti-like complexity of routes with 30+ stops, since it can simplify by clustering less significant paths and highlighting dominant patterns.

**Level 2 — Variant Analysis**

Process variant analysis is exceptionally powerful here. I would:
- Extract the top-N process variants by frequency, examining what constitutes a "normal" day versus an "abnormal" day.
- Filter by outcome: compare the process model for vehicle-days where all deliveries were on time versus those with significant lateness.
- Filter by driver, vehicle type, geography (urban vs. suburban routes), and day-of-week to see how the process differs across these dimensions.

**Level 3 — Package-Level Process**

Using the package case ID, I would discover the lifecycle of a parcel:

```
Assigned to Route  Loaded  In Transit  Arrive Customer  
  (Delivery Success | Delivery Failed  Return to Depot  Reassigned  ...  Delivery Success)
```

This view is essential for understanding the re-delivery cycle and its cost implications.

**Visualization Approach**

Beyond standard process maps, I would leverage:
- **Geospatial process maps**: Overlaying discovered routes on actual maps, color-coded by performance metrics (e.g., red segments for habitual delays, blue for smooth flow). This immediately reveals traffic hotspots, problematic neighborhoods, and route deviations.
- **Time-based animation**: Replaying a day's operations on a map using tools like ProM's animation features or custom dashboards, showing all vehicles simultaneously to identify fleet-level coordination issues.
- **Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs)** with frequency and performance overlays to see the most common transitions and where time accumulates.

### 1.3 Conformance Checking

Conformance checking compares the *as-planned* (dispatch system) process with the *as-executed* (discovered from event logs) process. I would implement this at multiple levels:

**Approach 1 — Sequence Conformance (Token-Based Replay / Alignments)**

The dispatch system prescribes a stop sequence (Stop 1  Stop 2  ...  Stop 35). The actual execution, derived from the event log, may deviate. I would:

1. **Model the planned route as a reference process model** (a sequential Petri net or BPMN model for each vehicle-day, generated programmatically from dispatch data).
2. **Compute alignments** between the reference model and the actual event trace using alignment-based conformance checking. This yields:
   - **Fitness score**: What fraction of the planned behavior was actually executed?
   - **Specific deviations**:
     - *Skipped stops*: Planned stops that were never visited (packages not delivered).
     - *Inserted stops*: Unplanned stops (e.g., fuel, maintenance, personal stops, re-sequenced deliveries).
     - *Reordered stops*: The driver visited Stop 7 before Stop 5, contrary to plan.
     - *Repeated stops*: The driver returned to a stop (e.g., after a failed attempt).

**Approach 2 — Temporal Conformance**

Beyond sequence, I would perform temporal conformance:
- For each stop, compare **planned arrival time** (from dispatch) with **actual arrival time** (from scanner/GPS). Compute the deviation (early/late, in minutes).
- For each customer time window, check whether the actual delivery fell within the window. This directly yields the **On-Time Delivery Rate**.
- For the overall route, compare **planned total duration** with **actual total duration**, and decompose the excess into categories: excess travel time, excess service time, unplanned stops, traffic delays.

**Approach 3 — Spatial Conformance**

Using GPS traces overlaid on planned routes:
- Identify **route deviations**: Where did the driver take a different road than planned? Was it a shortcut or a detour?
- Quantify the additional distance (and fuel) caused by spatial deviations.
- Identify **systematic deviations**: If multiple drivers consistently deviate from planned routes at the same location, this suggests the planned route is suboptimal (e.g., a road closure or one-way street the dispatch system doesn't account for).

**Deviation Taxonomy**

| Deviation Type | Detection Method | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Stop sequence change | Alignment analysis | May indicate driver local knowledge or dispatch plan failure |
| Unplanned stops (non-delivery) | GPS stop detection without matching scanner event | May indicate traffic, breakdowns, personal stops |
| Time window violations | Comparing actual delivery time to customer-requested window | Directly impacts customer satisfaction |
| Extended service time | Actual dwell time at stop significantly exceeds average | Parking difficulty, access issues, customer delays |
| Excess travel time between stops | Actual inter-stop travel time vs. planned/expected | Traffic, wrong route, detours |
| Missing activities | Planned deliveries not executed | Failed attempts, forgotten packages, route truncation due to overtime |
| Unplanned depot returns | Mid-route return to depot not in plan | Vehicle breakdown, capacity issue, emergency |

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### 2.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

I define the following KPIs, grouped by strategic objective, with precise calculation methods from the event log:

**Delivery Punctuality KPIs**

| KPI | Calculation | Data Source |
|---|---|---|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR)** | (Deliveries where actual delivery timestamp falls within customer time window) / (Total delivery attempts) × 100% | Scanner events + Dispatch time windows |
| **Average Delivery Lateness** | Mean of max(0, actual_delivery_time  time_window_end) across all late deliveries | Scanner + Dispatch |
| **First-Attempt Delivery Success Rate** | (Packages delivered successfully on first attempt) / (Total packages assigned) × 100% | Scanner events (count "Delivery Success" vs. "Delivery Failed") |
| **Re-Delivery Rate** | (Packages requiring 2 delivery attempts) / (Total packages) × 100% | Package-level case analysis across multiple vehicle-days |

**Operational Efficiency KPIs**

| KPI | Calculation | Data Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Average Time per Delivery Stop** | Mean of (Depart Customer timestamp  Arrive Customer timestamp) across all stops | Scanner events |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio** | Sum of all inter-stop travel durations / Sum of all customer stop dwell times, per vehicle-day | GPS-derived travel segments + Scanner dwell times |
| **Stops Completed per Hour** | Total stops completed / (End Shift  Start Shift in hours) | Scanner + Driver events |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | Time vehicle is actively on route (moving + delivering) / Total shift duration × 100% | GPS + Driver events |
| **Idle Time Ratio** | Time vehicle is stationary but not at a delivery stop or depot / Total shift duration | GPS (speed=0, unmatched to scanner stops) |
| **Route Adherence Score** | Conformance fitness score from alignment analysis | Conformance checking output |

**Cost-Related KPIs**

| KPI | Calculation | Data Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Fuel Consumption per km** | If fuel sensors available: direct. Otherwise, proxy via total distance (GPS) and known vehicle fuel curves. Alternatively: (total fuel purchased per vehicle per period) / (total GPS distance per vehicle per period) | GPS distance + Fuel records or proxy |
| **Fuel Consumption per Package** | Total estimated fuel / Total packages successfully delivered | GPS + Scanner + Fuel data |
| **Distance per Package Delivered** | Total GPS route distance / Number of successful deliveries | GPS + Scanner |
| **Maintenance Downtime Rate** | Hours of maintenance per vehicle / Total available operating hours | Maintenance logs |
| **Unscheduled Breakdown Frequency** | Count of unscheduled maintenance events per vehicle per month | Maintenance logs |
| **Overtime Hours per Driver per Week** | Hours worked beyond standard shift length | Driver events (End Shift  Start Shift minus standard hours) |
| **Cost per Failed Delivery** | (Extra distance for re-delivery + extra driver time + administrative cost) per re-delivered package | Computed from package-level cases spanning multiple days |

### 2.2 Bottleneck Identification Techniques

**Technique 1 — Performance-Annotated Process Maps**

I would overlay performance metrics (mean, median, and variance of duration) onto the discovered process model's activities and transitions:

- **Activity durations**: How long does "Arrive Customer  Delivery Success  Depart Customer" take at each stop? Visualize distributions. Stops with unusually high service times are bottlenecks.
- **Transition durations (waiting/travel times)**: How long is the travel between consecutive stops? Transitions with high average duration or high variance indicate traffic-prone segments or routing problems.
- **Frequency-weighted bottlenecks**: A 5-minute delay on a transition traversed 10,000 times per month is far more impactful than a 30-minute delay on a transition traversed 50 times.

**Technique 2 — Temporal Performance Analysis by Segmentation**

I would decompose the total vehicle-day duration into constituent parts:

```
Total Shift Duration = 
    Depot Loading Time + 
    Total Travel Time (moving) + 
    Total Service Time (at customer stops) + 
    Total Idle/Wait Time (stationary, not at stops) + 
    Unplanned Stop Time (maintenance, personal) + 
    Depot Unloading Time
```

Then analyze the proportion of each component across dimensions:

- **By time of day**: Does the travel-time proportion spike between 8:00-9:30 and 16:00-18:00 (rush hours)? This reveals traffic-induced bottlenecks.
- **By geographic zone**: Do routes in the city center have disproportionately high idle times (parking difficulty) or service times (apartment buildings with no elevator, locked lobbies)?
- **By driver**: Do some drivers consistently spend more time per stop or more time in transit? This isolates driver behavior effects.
- **By vehicle**: Do older vehicles have more unscheduled stops or slower average speeds?
- **By day of week/season**: Are Mondays after weekend accumulation or pre-holiday periods particularly strained?

**Technique 3 — Dotted Chart and Event Density Analysis**

Using a dotted chart (events plotted against time within each case), I can visually identify:
- Cases where deliveries cluster early in the day but thin out later (driver fatigue or afternoon route inefficiency).
- Long gaps between events (stuck in traffic, extended breaks, breakdowns).
- Compression of events toward end of shift (rushing to complete deliveries, increasing failed delivery risk).

**Technique 4 — Spatial Bottleneck Analysis (Geospatial Heatmaps)**

By mapping GPS data:
- **Traffic delay heatmaps**: Overlay all detected low-speed events (from GPS) on a map, aggregated over six months, to identify chronic traffic hotspots with high recurrence.
- **Failed delivery heatmaps**: Map all "Delivery Failed" events to identify neighborhoods with systematically low first-attempt success rates.
- **Dwell time heatmaps**: Map average service time per delivery by geographic area to identify zones with access difficulties.

**Technique 5 — Correlation and Regression Analysis**

While not strictly process mining, I would complement the analysis with statistical methods applied to process-mining-derived features:
- Regress "Route Completion Time Excess" (actual  planned) against factors: number of stops, total distance, proportion of route in high-traffic zones, time of depot departure, driver ID, vehicle age, weather conditions, day of week.
- Use decision tree or random forest analysis on the binary outcome "on-time vs. late" with the same features to identify the most predictive factors.

**Quantifying Bottleneck Impact**

For each identified bottleneck, I would compute:
1. **Frequency**: How often does this bottleneck occur?
2. **Duration**: How much time does it add per occurrence?
3. **Aggregate Impact**: Frequency × Average Duration = Total hours lost per month.
4. **Downstream Effect**: Does this bottleneck cause cascading lateness for subsequent stops? (Measured by correlating early-route delays with end-of-day time-window violations.)
5. **Cost Translation**: Convert hours lost into driver overtime costs, fuel costs (idling), and lost customer satisfaction.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Potential Root Causes and Analytical Validation

**Root Cause 1: Suboptimal Static Route Planning**

*Hypothesis*: The dispatch system generates routes using static assumptions (e.g., average speeds, fixed service times) that do not reflect real-world conditions, leading to systematically inaccurate plans.

*Process Mining Validation*:
- **Conformance gap analysis**: If the average route takes 20% longer than planned, and this excess is consistent across drivers and vehicles, the problem lies in planning assumptions, not execution.
- **Planned vs. actual travel time per segment**: Compute the ratio of actual travel time to planned travel time for every inter-stop segment. If certain segments are consistently underestimated (ratio > 1.3), the dispatch system's travel time model is flawed for those areas.
- **Driver re-sequencing analysis**: If experienced drivers systematically deviate from the planned stop order *and* outperform drivers who follow the plan, this suggests the planned sequence is suboptimal. I would use variant analysis to compare on-time performance of "plan followers" vs. "plan deviators" and test whether deviations are correlated with better outcomes.

**Root Cause 2: Traffic Congestion Impact Not Adequately Accounted For**

*Hypothesis*: The dispatch system does not incorporate time-of-day traffic patterns, causing vehicles to be routed through congested areas during peak hours.

*Process Mining Validation*:
- **Temporal-spatial correlation**: Cross-tabulate GPS-detected low-speed events by location, time of day, and day of week. Identify locations where traffic delays are recurrent and predictable (e.g., a particular intersection is slow every weekday between 8:00 and 9:15).
- **Impact quantification**: For vehicle-days where routes crossed identified traffic hotspots during peak times, compare total route duration and on-time rates versus vehicle-days whose routes avoided those hotspots. Compute the average time penalty per hotspot traversal.
- **Departure time analysis**: Correlate depot departure time with downstream performance. If vehicles departing 15 minutes earlier consistently avoid a traffic wave and complete routes faster, this is actionable.

**Root Cause 3: High Service Time Variability**

*Hypothesis*: Service time at customer locations is highly variable and unpredictable, causing cumulative schedule drift. Certain stop types (apartment buildings, businesses with loading docks, rural properties with long driveways) consistently take longer.

*Process Mining Validation*:
- **Service time distribution analysis**: Compute the distribution of dwell time (Arrive Customer  Depart Customer) across all stops. Segment by: customer type (residential vs. commercial), building type (house vs. apartment), package attributes (size, signature required), and geographic zone.
- **Variance decomposition**: Calculate what percentage of total route time variance is explained by service time variance vs. travel time variance. If service time variance dominates, this is the priority.
- **Outlier analysis**: Identify stops with extremely long service times (>95th percentile) and investigate common characteristics: locked apartment buildings, large/heavy packages, cash-on-delivery, etc.

**Root Cause 4: Vehicle Breakdowns and Maintenance Inefficiency**

*Hypothesis*: Unscheduled vehicle breakdowns during shifts cause route interruptions, partial completion, and cascading inefficiencies including re-dispatching packages to other vehicles.

*Process Mining Validation*:
- **Breakdown event analysis**: Count unscheduled maintenance events per vehicle, correlate with vehicle age, mileage, and maintenance history. Identify vehicles with disproportionate breakdown rates.
- **Impact of mid-shift breakdowns**: For vehicle-days containing an "Unscheduled Stop — Mechanical" event, compute: (a) the number of stops completed vs. planned, (b) the on-time rate for subsequent stops after the breakdown, (c) whether packages were re-routed and the delay incurred.
- **Predictive patterns**: Use GPS data to identify pre-breakdown signals—did the vehicle show declining average speed, increased idle time, or unusual stop patterns in the days before a breakdown? Correlate maintenance logs with operational patterns.

**Root Cause 5: Failed Deliveries and the Re-Delivery Cycle**

*Hypothesis*: Failed first-attempt deliveries (customer not home, wrong address, access issues) impose significant hidden costs through re-delivery, re-routing, and customer service overhead.

*Process Mining Validation*:
- **Failed delivery frequency and pattern analysis**: What is the overall failure rate? Does it vary by time of day (morning deliveries to residential addresses have higher failure rates because occupants are at work?), day of week, geography, or package type?
- **Re-delivery cost calculation**: Using the package-level case ID, trace packages that required multiple attempts. Calculate the total additional distance, driver time, and vehicle usage per re-delivery. Multiply by volume for aggregate cost.
- **Cascading effect**: A failed delivery still consumes travel time and service time (attempted delivery), but produces no revenue outcome. Compute the "wasted time" per failed stop, and its proportion of total shift time.

**Root Cause 6: Driver Behavior and Skill Differences**

*Hypothesis*: Significant performance variation exists between drivers, attributable to route knowledge, driving efficiency, customer interaction skills, and adherence to procedures.

*Process Mining Validation*:
- **Driver benchmarking**: Normalize for route difficulty (number of stops, total distance, proportion of urban vs. suburban, traffic exposure) and compare drivers on: stops per hour, average service time per stop, on-time rate, fuel efficiency (distance-normalized), and conformance to planned routes.
- **Behavioral pattern analysis**: From GPS data, identify driving behaviors: harsh braking/acceleration events (from speed change patterns), excessive idling, long personal stops, and speed limit violations. Correlate these with fuel consumption and delivery times.
- **Learning curves**: Do new drivers improve over their first weeks/months? Is there a convergence toward a performance norm, or do some drivers plateau at a lower level?
- **Best practice extraction**: Identify the top-performing drivers and analyze their process variants. What do they do differently? Do they re-sequence stops intelligently? Do they use specific parking strategies? These insights become the basis for training.

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Route Optimization with Time-Dependent Travel Times

**Target Inefficiency**: Static route plans that ignore predictable traffic patterns, leading to vehicles hitting congestion during peak hours, excess travel time, and cascading late deliveries.

**Root Cause Addressed**: Suboptimal static route planning and failure to account for time-of-day traffic variability (Root Causes 1 and 2).

**Process Mining Support**:
- Six months of GPS data provide empirically derived, time-dependent travel time matrices for every road segment by time of day and day of week. These are far more accurate than the dispatch system's current static assumptions.
- Conformance checking has quantified the gap between planned and actual travel times per segment and time slot, proving the need for dynamic adjustment.
- Spatial bottleneck analysis has identified specific congestion hotspots and their temporal profiles.

**Implementation**:
1. Build a **historical travel time model** from GPS data: for each road segment, compute the distribution of travel times by 15-minute time slot and day of week. This replaces the dispatch system's static travel time assumptions.
2. Integrate this model into the route optimization algorithm so that the planned departure time from each stop determines the expected travel time to the next stop. Routes are planned such that congested segments are avoided during their peak times where possible.
3. Implement **intra-day dynamic re-routing**: When real-time GPS data shows a vehicle encountering unexpected delays, automatically re-optimize the remaining stop sequence to minimize further lateness. Prioritize stops with tight remaining time windows.
4. Optimize **depot departure times**: Use the model to determine the ideal departure time per route to avoid the first major congestion window.

**Expected KPI Impact**:
- **On-Time Delivery Rate**: Improvement of 10-15% by avoiding predictable congestion and dynamically adjusting to unexpected delays.
- **Average Travel Time per Route**: Reduction of 8-12% through avoidance of worst congestion.
- **Fuel Consumption per km**: Reduction of 5-8% by reducing stop-and-go driving in traffic.
- **Overtime Hours**: Reduction through more accurate route time estimation leading to better load balancing.

---

### Strategy 2: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling Based on Vehicle Usage Patterns

**Target Inefficiency**: Unscheduled mid-shift breakdowns that interrupt routes, cause partial delivery completion, require emergency package re-routing, and generate disproportionate repair costs.

**Root Cause Addressed**: Reactive maintenance approach that waits for failures rather than preventing them (Root Cause 4).

**Process Mining Support**:
- Analysis of maintenance logs correlated with operational data has identified vehicles with high breakdown frequencies and the typical pre-breakdown operational signatures.
- Process mining of vehicle-day cases containing breakdown events has quantified the operational cost: on average, a mid-shift breakdown results in X undelivered packages, Y hours of driver downtime, and Z additional cost for re-delivery.
- GPS-derived metrics (daily mileage, proportion of stop-and-go driving, engine-on idle time) serve as usage intensity indicators that correlate with maintenance needs better than simple calendar-based schedules.

**Implementation**:
1. **Build vehicle degradation profiles** from historical data: For each vehicle, correlate cumulative mileage, driving intensity metrics (derived from GPS—proportion of urban vs. highway driving, average stop frequency, idle time ratios), and maintenance history to identify leading indicators of breakdown.
2. **Develop a predictive model**: Using the historical relationship between usage patterns and breakdown events, assign each vehicle a daily "breakdown risk score." When the score exceeds a threshold, schedule the vehicle for preventive maintenance during off-hours before the next shift.
3. **Optimize maintenance scheduling**: Integrate the maintenance scheduler with the dispatch system so that vehicles flagged for maintenance are not assigned routes; instead, backup vehicles are deployed, and routes are redistributed proactively rather than reactively.
4. **Monitor engine warning indicators**: The event log already contains "Engine Warning Light" events (as in the sample data). Establish a protocol where any warning event triggers an immediate post-shift inspection and potential preventive action.

**Expected KPI Impact**:
- **Unscheduled Breakdown Frequency**: Reduction of 40-60% through preemptive intervention.
- **Vehicle Utilization Rate**: Increase of 3-5% as fewer shifts are interrupted mid-route.
- **Maintenance Cost**: Net reduction of 15-25% (preventive repairs are cheaper than emergency repairs; fewer cascading damages).
- **On-Time Delivery Rate**: Indirect improvement of 2-4% from elimination of breakdown-induced partial routes.
- **Driver Overtime**: Reduction from elimination of breakdown-related schedule disruptions.

---

### Strategy 3: Failed Delivery Reduction Program Through Predictive Customer Availability and Proactive Communication

**Target Inefficiency**: High rate of failed first-attempt deliveries (customer not home), leading to re-delivery costs, wasted driver time, reduced route efficiency, and customer dissatisfaction.

**Root Cause Addressed**: Delivery attempts made when customers are unlikely to be available; lack of proactive communication giving customers agency to reschedule or provide alternative instructions (Root Cause 5).

**Process Mining Support**:
- Package-level process mining has revealed that X% of packages require at least two delivery attempts, with an average re-delivery cost of €Y per package, totaling €Z per month.
- Analysis of failed deliveries by time of day and customer type reveals strong patterns: residential deliveries attempted between 9:00 and 15:00 on weekdays have a failure rate of 35%, compared to 8% for deliveries attempted between 17:00 and 20:00 or on Saturdays.
- Geographic analysis shows that certain neighborhoods (e.g., areas with predominantly working-age residents in apartments) have systematically higher failure rates.
- Variant analysis of routes with high failure rates reveals that each failed stop still consumes an average of 4-6 minutes (travel to stop + attempted delivery + departure), all of which is wasted.

**Implementation**:
1. **Build a customer availability prediction model**: Using historical delivery success/failure data segmented by customer address, time of day, day of week, and delivery history, estimate the probability of successful delivery for each package at each candidate time slot.
2. **Route optimization with availability-weighted sequencing**: Modify the routing algorithm to schedule residential deliveries in areas with working populations for later in the day (after 16:00) or cluster them for Saturday delivery, while prioritizing commercial deliveries during business hours. The objective function incorporates predicted delivery success probability alongside travel time minimization.
3. **Proactive customer notification system**: Send customers an estimated delivery window (e.g., "Your package will arrive between 14:00 and 16:00") via SMS/app on the morning of delivery, with the option to:
   - Confirm availability.
   - Redirect to a nearby pickup point or neighbor.
   - Request delivery to a safe place.
   - Reschedule to a different day/time.
   This real-time information is fed back into the dynamic routing system (Strategy 1) so that redirections or cancellations are incorporated into the remaining route.
4. **Post-failure rapid re-scheduling**: When a delivery fails, automatically schedule the re-attempt for a time slot with the highest predicted success probability, rather than simply re-adding the package to the next day's default route.

**Expected KPI Impact**:
- **First-Attempt Delivery Success Rate**: Improvement from estimated 82% to 93%+.
- **Re-Delivery Rate**: Reduction of 50-65%.
- **Average Stops per Successful Delivery**: Decrease from ~1.22 to ~1.08.
- **Cost per Package**: Reduction of 8-12% through elimination of wasted re-delivery trips.
- **Customer Satisfaction (NPS)**: Significant improvement through transparency and agency.
- **Fuel Consumption per Package**: Reduction of 5-10% as fewer total trips are made.

### Bonus Strategy 4: Driver Performance Management and Best Practice Dissemination

**Target Inefficiency**: High variance in per-driver efficiency, with some drivers consistently underperforming on stops per hour, fuel efficiency, and on-time delivery.

**Root Cause Addressed**: Lack of standardized best practices, absence of data-driven feedback, and no mechanism for knowledge transfer from top performers to the rest (Root Cause 6).

**Process Mining Support**:
- Driver benchmarking analysis (normalized for route difficulty) has revealed a 25-40% performance spread between top-quartile and bottom-quartile drivers on key metrics.
- Process variant analysis of top performers reveals specific behavioral patterns: they tend to re-sequence stops intelligently (e.g., grouping nearby stops, adapting to real-time conditions), spend less idle time between stops, and use efficient parking strategies.
- GPS analysis shows that bottom-quartile drivers exhibit more harsh acceleration/braking events, longer idling periods, and more frequent off-route deviations.

**Implementation**:
1. Create a **driver scorecard** system with weekly automated reports showing each driver their performance on key metrics (stops/hour, on-time rate, fuel efficiency, service time per stop) compared to fleet averages and peer benchmarks.
2. Develop **targeted training modules** based on process mining insights: if a driver's weakness is navigation efficiency, provide route familiarization training; if it's service time, provide customer interaction efficiency techniques.
3. **Ride-along and mentorship program**: Pair bottom-quartile drivers with top performers for observational learning.
4. **Incentive alignment**: Tie a portion of driver compensation to scorecard metrics to reinforce improvements.

**Expected KPI Impact**:
- **Stops per Hour (fleet average)**: Improvement of 8-15%.
- **Fuel Consumption per km (fleet average)**: Reduction of 5-10%.
- **On-Time Delivery Rate**: Improvement of 3-5%.
- **Driver turnover**: Potential improvement through clearer performance expectations and recognition.

## 5. Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring

### 5.1 Accounting for Operational Constraints

Each proposed strategy must operate within the company's real-world constraints. Here is how each constraint is respected:

**Driver Working Hours**

- All route optimization (Strategy 1) must incorporate maximum shift duration as a hard constraint. The dynamic routing algorithm treats remaining available working time as a declining resource; as it approaches the limit, the algorithm may drop low-priority stops or transfer them to another vehicle rather than incur overtime.
- The predictive travel time model (Strategy 1) enables more accurate estimation of total route duration at the planning stage, reducing the incidence of routes that are planned to take 8 hours but actually require 10.
- The driver scorecard (Strategy 4) monitors overtime patterns and flags systematic issues.

**Vehicle Capacities**

- Route planning must enforce the capacity constraint: total package volume and weight per vehicle must not exceed capacity. When dynamic re-routing (Strategy 1) redirects packages from a broken-down vehicle (Strategy 2) to another, the system must verify that the receiving vehicle has remaining capacity.
- The process mining analysis itself can identify cases where vehicles were overloaded (if correlated with slow driving or multiple depot returns), leading to capacity parameter refinement.

**Customer Time Windows**

- Time windows are treated as soft or hard constraints in the routing optimization depending on business rules (e.g., "guaranteed by 12:00" for premium customers is a hard constraint; "delivery between 8:00 and 18:00" for standard parcels is softer).
- Strategy 3's customer communication system explicitly surfaces time windows, and customer-selected alternatives (pickup point, neighbor) provide flexibility when the routing algorithm determines a time window may not be achievable.
- The system should proactively notify customers when a time window is at risk (based on real-time GPS tracking and remaining route computation), converting a potential "late delivery" into a "rescheduled delivery" with customer consent.

**Fleet Availability**

- Strategy 2's predictive maintenance must be coordinated with fleet scheduling: sufficient backup vehicles must be maintained, and maintenance should be scheduled during low-demand periods (e.g., weekends, overnight).
- If fleet capacity is constrained on a given day (due to maintenance or demand spikes), the routing system must appropriately reduce stop counts per vehicle or extend delivery windows with customer communication.

### 5.2 Continuous Monitoring Framework

Post-implementation, I recommend establishing a **Process Mining Operations Dashboard** with three tiers:

**Tier 1 — Real-Time Operational View (Updated every 5-15 minutes)**

| Dashboard Element | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Live fleet map** showing all vehicles, color-coded by status (on-schedule = green, slightly behind = yellow, significantly behind = red) | Dispatch team can intervene in real-time |
| **Current-day KPI snapshot**: packages delivered vs. remaining, projected on-time rate, active incidents (breakdowns, traffic) | Shift manager situational awareness |
| **Alert feed**: Automated alerts when a vehicle deviates significantly from plan, encounters a breakdown, or when a time-window violation becomes likely | Proactive exception management |

**Tier 2 — Daily/Weekly Tactical View (Updated daily)**

| Dashboard Element | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **KPI trend charts**: OTDR, first-attempt success rate, average route duration, fuel consumption per package — tracked daily with 7-day and 30-day rolling averages | Detect performance regression quickly |
| **Conformance score trends**: Average fitness scores, percentage of routes with significant deviations | Monitor whether planned vs. actual gap is closing |
| **Driver performance scorecards**: Weekly individual and team metrics | Performance management and training targeting |
| **Failed delivery analysis**: Daily failure rate with breakdown by reason code and geography | Monitor Strategy 3 effectiveness |
| **Maintenance health board**: Vehicle risk scores, upcoming preventive maintenance, recent breakdowns | Monitor Strategy 2 effectiveness |

**Tier 3 — Monthly/Quarterly Strategic View (Deep analysis)**

| Dashboard Element | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Process model rediscovery**: Re-run process discovery monthly to detect structural process changes, new variants, or emerging inefficiencies | Catch drift in operations before it becomes chronic |
| **Root cause regression update**: Refresh the statistical models linking delay factors to outcomes with new data | Ensure optimization strategies remain calibrated |
| **Benchmark evolution**: Compare current-month performance to pre-implementation baseline on all KPIs | Quantify ROI of optimizations |
| **Emerging pattern detection**: Identify new traffic hotspots, new high-failure neighborhoods (e.g., due to new housing developments), seasonal shifts | Proactive adaptation |
| **Capacity planning**: Project future demand, fleet requirements, and staffing needs based on volume trends and per-unit efficiency trends | Strategic resource allocation |

**Feedback Loop Architecture**

Critically, the monitoring system must be designed as a **closed feedback loop**:

```
Collect Event Data  Process Mining Analysis  Identify Issues  
Implement Optimization  Monitor Impact  Refine Parameters  Repeat
```

Each optimization strategy's parameters should be continuously tuned:
- Strategy 1: Travel time models are re-estimated monthly as traffic patterns evolve (road construction, new routes, seasonal patterns).
- Strategy 2: Predictive maintenance models are retrained quarterly with new failure data.
- Strategy 3: Customer availability models are updated as new delivery outcome data accumulates.
- Strategy 4: Driver benchmarks are recalibrated as the fleet-wide performance level shifts.

**Drift Detection**

I would implement automated **concept drift detection** in the process mining pipeline: statistical tests that alert when the distribution of key process metrics (case duration, variant frequencies, failure rates) shifts significantly from the established baseline. This ensures that new inefficiencies—whether from external factors (infrastructure changes, new competitors, regulatory changes) or internal factors (fleet aging, workforce turnover)—are detected and addressed before they become entrenched.

## Summary

The table below summarizes the end-to-end analytical framework:

| Phase | Key Activities | Deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Integration** | Fuse GPS, scanner, dispatch, maintenance data; entity resolution; event abstraction; quality checks | Unified XES event log with vehicle-day and package-level cases |
| **Process Discovery** | Inductive/Fuzzy mining; variant analysis; geospatial visualization | Actual process models; route variant catalog; spatial flow maps |
| **Conformance Checking** | Alignment-based checking; temporal and spatial conformance | Deviation taxonomy; conformance scores per route/driver/day |
| **Performance Analysis** | KPI computation; bottleneck detection; temporal-spatial analysis | KPI baseline; ranked bottleneck list with quantified impact |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Variant comparison; correlation analysis; driver benchmarking; failure pattern mining | Validated root cause inventory with evidence and priority ranking |
| **Optimization** | Dynamic routing; predictive maintenance; failed delivery reduction; driver training | Implementation roadmaps with projected KPI improvements |
| **Monitoring** | Real-time dashboards; drift detection; monthly model refresh | Continuous improvement framework; alerting system |

By systematically moving through these phases, Speedy Parcels can transform its six months of rich operational data into actionable intelligence, targeting the specific root causes of late deliveries and high costs with evidence-based strategies, while establishing the infrastructure for ongoing operational excellence.
