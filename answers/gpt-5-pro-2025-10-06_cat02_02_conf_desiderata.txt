Part 1 — Normative (hard-rule) conformance

- Case 1: Compliant
  - Order is correct: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
  - No forbidden actions.

- Case 2: Violations
  - Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check (08:20 vs 09:00) — violates “Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.”
  - Inform Applicant missing — violates “Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision” and the overall required sequence (no skipping).
  - Finalize Documentation after a rejection — violates “If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case.”
  - Net effect: multiple hard-rule breaches and an out-of-sequence execution.

- Case 3: Compliant
  - Order is correct: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
  - No forbidden actions.


Part 2 — Desiderata (soft-rule) adherence

- Case 1
  - Credit Check within 24h of application: Yes (30 minutes).
  - Inform Applicant within 48h of decision: Yes (2 hours).
  - Follow-up Call before close: Not recorded — minor deviation.

- Case 2
  - Credit Check within 24h of application: Yes (1 hour).
  - Inform Applicant within 48h: Not assessable because Inform Applicant is missing (normative breach already). If treated as a recommendation, it is not met.
  - Follow-up Call before close: Not recorded — minor deviation.

- Case 3
  - Credit Check within 24h of application: No (about 49 hours) — minor deviation.
  - Inform Applicant within 48h of decision: No (about 51 hours) — minor deviation.
  - Follow-up Call before close: Not recorded — minor deviation.

Summary:
- Normative violations: Case 2 only.
- Desiderata deviations: 
  - Case 1: Missing Follow-up Call.
  - Case 2: Missing Follow-up Call; prompt notification cannot be confirmed (and is effectively not met).
  - Case 3: Late Credit Check (~49h), late Inform Applicant (~51h), and missing Follow-up Call.
- These desiderata deviations are suboptimal but not serious violations.


Part 3 — Possible interpretations/justifications

- Case 2
  - Risk Assessment before Credit Check: Could stem from data-entry timing or using a “preliminary risk triage” step mislabeled as “Risk Assessment.” If that preliminary step is intended, consider relabeling it to maintain the normative rule that the formal Risk Assessment follows the Credit Check.
  - Finalize Documentation after rejection: May reflect that staff “finalize” a rejection letter or archive documents under a generic “Finalize Documentation” label. If so, rename to “Issue Rejection Notice” or “Archive Case” to avoid violating the rule meant for approved loans.
  - Missing Inform Applicant: Communication might have occurred outside the system (phone/email) without logging. Consider integrating communication capture or enforcing a mandatory “Inform Applicant” event before close.

- Case 3
  - Long delays (Credit Check and Inform Applicant): Could be workload peaks, waiting for third-party data, holidays, or staffing constraints. Soft SLAs with alerts at 24h (Credit Check) and 48h (Inform) could help without making them hard stops.

- Follow-up Call (all cases)
  - Its absence may mean the team prioritizes speed or that the call is only done for edge cases. If it’s valuable, prompt agents with a non-blocking reminder before closing; otherwise, accept the low adoption as consistent with its optional nature.
