### **BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

#### **Process Name:**  
Invoice Approval and Payment Scheduling

#### **Primary Objective:**  
To verify and approve incoming supplier invoices for payment, ensuring alignment with purchase orders (POs), receipt of goods/services, and organizational policies.

---

### **Key Roles & Participants:**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Initiates process, logs invoices, performs PO matching, sends for approval, schedules payment.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Confirms receipt of goods/services and validates invoice against PO.
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Final approval authority; reviews invoice for anomalies.
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita):** Handles exceptions, escalations, and unresolved discrepancies.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Supports resolution of supplier-related issues (e.g., missing POs, pricing disputes).
- **Supplier:** Provides invoices and corrective documentation when needed.

---

### **Process Flow (Textual BPMN Representation)**

> **Start Event:**  
> *Invoice arrives via email (or system upload) from a supplier.*

---

#### **1. [Activity] Receive and Validate Invoice**
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- **Description:** Mary receives the invoice and checks for a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
- **Input:** Incoming invoice (PDF/email/attachment), PO number (if present)
- **Output:** Decision on next step based on PO presence.

> **Gateway: Decision – PO Number Present?**
> - **Yes  Proceed to Step 2**
> - **No  Escalate to Supplier (via Mary) for PO clarification or correction**

> **Note:** If PO is missing, Mary contacts the supplier (via email or through Karen) to obtain it. *This is a common exception path.*

---

#### **2. [Activity] Log Invoice into Accounting System**
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- **Description:** Mary enters the invoice into the accounting system, creating a record with a unique invoice ID.
- **Input:** Invoice, PO number (if now available)
- **Output:** Logged invoice record in system

> **Sequence Flow:**  Step 3

---

#### **3. [Activity] Request Receipt Confirmation from Purchasing**
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- **Description:** Mary forwards the invoice to Purchasing Officer (Dan) for confirmation that goods/services were received.
- **Trigger:** System-generated notification or manual email.
- **Input:** Invoice record, PO details
- **Output:** Confirmation (or rejection) from Purchasing

> **Gateway: Decision – Receipt Confirmed?**
> - **Yes  Proceed to Step 4**
> - **No  Escalate to Dan (follow-up) or to Rita (if unresolved)**

> **Note:** Dan may request additional documentation (e.g., delivery receipt, signed delivery note). If confirmation is delayed, Mary may follow up.

---

#### **4. [Activity] Match Invoice to Purchase Order**
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- **Description:** Mary compares invoice line items (quantities, prices, delivery charges) against the PO.
- **Input:** Invoice, PO, receipt confirmation
- **Output:** Match status (match or mismatch)

> **Gateway: Decision – Invoice Matches PO?**
> - **Yes  Proceed to Step 5 (Manager Approval)**
> - **No  Escalate to Mary for clarification or to Rita (if unresolved)**

> **Note:**  
> - Mismatches may involve:
>   - Incorrect pricing
>   - Extra units billed
>   - Missing or incorrect delivery charges
> - If mismatch is minor and resolvable, Mary may contact Dan or Karen for clarification.
> - If unresolved after 2–3 days, Mary escalates to Rita.

---

#### **5. [Activity] Request Manager Approval**
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- **Description:** System automatically sends a notification to Department Manager (Carlos) for approval.
- **Trigger:** Successful PO match and receipt confirmation
- **Input:** Invoice, PO, receipt confirmation, match report
- **Output:** Approval or rejection from Carlos

> **Gateway: Decision – Manager Approval Received?**
> - **Yes  Proceed to Step 6**
> - **No  Reject and return to Mary for investigation or hold**

> **Note:**  
> - Carlos may reject if:
>   - Total amount exceeds budget
>   - Unusual or unexpected items
>   - Suspicious pricing
> - On rejection, Carlos may instruct Mary to investigate further (e.g., check contract, contact Karen).

---

#### **6. [Activity] Schedule for Payment**
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- **Description:** Mary adds the approved invoice to the next scheduled payment run (e.g., weekly or biweekly).
- **Input:** Approved invoice, payment schedule
- **Output:** Invoice scheduled for payment

> **End Event:**  
> *Invoice is paid according to the payment cycle.*

---

### **Exception & Alternative Paths (Re-work Loops / Escalations)**

#### **Exception Path A: Missing or Invalid PO Number**
- **Trigger:** No PO found in invoice
- **Step:** Mary contacts supplier (via email or Karen)
- **Outcome:**  
  - If PO provided  Resume normal flow (Step 2)  
  - If PO not provided after 3 attempts  Escalate to Rita  
  - **Rita Action:** Coordinates with department head to create a **retrospective PO** or **reject invoice**  
  - Once PO is approved, process resumes from Step 2

> **Note:** Rita may also initiate this path for non-PO invoices (e.g., service contracts without formal POs).

#### **Exception Path B: Discrepancy in Invoice vs. PO**
- **Trigger:** Mismatch detected in Step 4
- **Step:** Mary contacts Dan or Karen for clarification
- **Outcome:**  
  - If resolved  Resume flow (Step 5)  
  - If unresolved after 3 days  Escalate to Rita  
  - **Rita Action:** Contacts supplier (via Karen), reviews contract, decides whether to:
    - Accept corrected invoice
    - Reject invoice
    - Approve with exception (e.g., partial payment)

> **Note:** Rita may also override the system if a valid business case exists (e.g., urgent service, informal agreement).

#### **Exception Path C: Manager Rejects Invoice**
- **Trigger:** Carlos rejects invoice in Step 5
- **Step:** Invoice returned to Mary with reason
- **Action:** Mary investigates:
  - Checks contract (via Karen)
  - Verifies budget
  - Confirms delivery
- **Outcome:**  
  - If issue is resolved  Resubmit for approval  
  - If unresolved  Escalate to Rita (for final decision)  
  - If rejected by Rita  Invoice archived or returned to supplier

### **Artifacts (Data Objects / Documents)**
| Artifact | Description | Movement |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Supplier Invoice** | Incoming document (PDF/email) | From Supplier  Mary |
| **Purchase Order (PO)** | Pre-existing document from procurement | From PO system  Mary (for reference) |
| **Receipt Confirmation** | Proof of delivery (e.g., delivery note, signed form) | From Dan  Mary |
| **Invoice Matching Report** | Internal summary of PO vs. invoice comparison | Generated by Mary, used in approval |
| **Approval Request (System Notification)** | Digital request to Carlos | System  Carlos |
| **Payment Schedule** | List of invoices to be paid in next cycle | Generated by Mary, used in Step 6 |

---

### **Ambiguities & Uncertainties (Noted for Clarity)**
- **PO Creation:** It is unclear whether retrospective POs are created before or after invoice approval. Rita’s role suggests they are created *after* initial review but *before* resumption of the flow.
- **System Automation:** While Mary mentions system-generated emails, it's unclear whether the entire workflow is automated (e.g., auto-advance on confirmation) or manually triggered.
- **Escalation Thresholds:** No defined time limits for follow-ups or escalation triggers (e.g., “after 3 days”) are explicitly stated in interviews, but inferred from narrative.
- **Payment Run Frequency:** Not specified whether payment scheduling is weekly, biweekly, or on demand.

> **Consolidated Assumption:** The process assumes a **biweekly payment cycle** and **manual system triggers** for notifications, with **automated routing only at key decision points** (e.g., approval request).

---

### **Summary of Key Decision Points (Gateways)**
| Gateway | Condition | Outcomes |
|-------|----------|---------|
| PO Present? | Yes  Continue; No  Escalate to Supplier / Rita | PO missing  hold, request correction |
| Receipt Confirmed? | Yes  Continue; No  Follow up / escalate | Delayed confirmation  follow-up |
| Invoice Matches PO? | Yes  Approve; No  Clarify or escalate | Discrepancy  investigate or escalate |
| Manager Approves? | Yes  Schedule payment; No  Reject / Investigate | Rejection  loop back to Mary |

  - **Tasks:** Clearly labeled with role (e.g., "Log Invoice – Mary")
  - **Gateways:** Exclusive Decision (diamonds) for all conditions
  - **Sequence Flows:** Solid lines with directional arrows
  - **Swimlanes:** Organized by role (Mary, Dan, Carlos, Rita, Karen, Supplier)
  - **Exceptions:** Use dashed lines or sub-processes to show rework loops
  - **Artifacts:** Represented as documents in corners of tasks
