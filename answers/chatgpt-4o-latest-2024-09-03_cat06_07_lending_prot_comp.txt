### Main Differences in Treatment: Protected vs. Unprotected Group

Based on the process variants and their performance data, we can identify several points of potential disparate treatment between the **protected** group and the **unprotected** group. Below, I highlight the **key differences** in terms of process steps and overall time, indicating possible unfair treatment or inefficiencies. 

---

### 1. **Frequency of Loan Approvals:**
   The **unprotected** group has a higher frequency of process variants leading to loan approvals compared to the **protected** group.

   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - "Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" occurs **1656** times (performance = 340004.889).
   
   - **Protected Group:**
     - "Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" occurs **31** times (performance = 310018.097).
   
   **Interpretation:** The unprotected group has a **significantly higher frequency** of loan approvals compared to the protected group. This indicates that applicants in the unprotected group are approved more frequently, despite similar performance values.

---

### 2. **Process Complexity (Additional Steps):**
   The **protected** group frequently sees more complex loan approval processes involving additional steps, which are often unnecessary for the **unprotected** group.

   - The **protected** group often has additional steps like "*Make Visit to Assess Collateral*" or "*Request Co-Signer On Loan*" before reaching either loan denial or loan approval. These steps often repeat.
   
   - The **unprotected** group shows some instances of the "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" step, but it’s less frequent, and the process often skips certain examinations.

   **Example:**
   - **Protected Group:** 
     - Has multiple variants with repeating assessment steps (e.g., `Request Co-Signer -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral`), appearing in customers facing loan denials or even final approvals.
     - Ex: (frequency = 33, performance 369992.182), (frequency = 15, performance = 390019.000).

   - **Unprotected Group:** 
     - Fewer cases involve repeating or redundant assessment steps.
     - Ex: (frequency = 1 with 489840.000 performance) for complex steps involving repeated requests for a co-signer and visits.

   **Interpretation:** The **protected group** often faces a more convoluted application process with redundant steps, leading to more prolonged processing times. For the **unprotected group**, certain steps like collateral assessments or re-evaluations appear to be streamlined or skipped, causing a less burdensome process.

### 3. **Performance (Process Time):**
   There is a noticeable disparity in execution times, especially when it comes to the denial or completion of applications.

   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Rejected applications (e.g., `Application Rejected`) take **less time**: 260002.042 (frequency = 664).
     - `Loan Denied` process variant has performance values around 340005.309.

   - **Protected Group:**
     - Similar actions take longer. For example, `Application Rejected` takes **219999.156** (frequency = 960).
     - Loan denied performance times are higher, ranging from **310,015** to **390,000** depending on complexity.
   
   **Interpretation:** The **unprotected group** experiences **faster rejections and decisions**, leading to a more efficient experience (albeit a denial), potentially reducing difficulties. **Protected group** applicants face longer processing times, likely stemming from the additional redundant tasks.

---

### 4. **Appointment Denied Frequency and Time:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - `Appointment Denied` occurs **599 times** (performance = 90,000.623).
  
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - `Appointment Denied` occurs **363 times** (performance = 80,001.088).
  
   **Interpretation:** It appears that the **protected group** faces more frequently denied appointments than the unprotected group. **Protected applicants** might be encountering more administrative hurdles or stricter appointment-setting standards. Moreover, **protected applicants' denials take longer**, thus making the initial phase of the process slower and more prone to delay.

---

### 5. **Skipped Examination for Unprotected Group vs. Repeated Visits for Protected Group:**
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The unprotected group has a process variant where the examination step is skipped (`Verify Borrowers Information -> skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement`), with **332 instances** (performance = 260,013.446).
   
   - **Protected Group:**
     - This step is **never skipped** for the protected group. Instead, they experience **multiple** (redundant) visits and collateral assessments, leading to increased processing time.

   **Interpretation:** The "**skipped_examination**" process for the **unprotected group** adds efficiency to the approval process, while the **protected group** is required to undergo stricter, more repetitive scrutiny, significantly extending their processing times.

---

### 6. **More Frequent Loan Request Modifications (Co-Signer and Collateral Requests):**
   The **protected group** is significantly more likely to be asked to provide additional elements, such as a co-signer or collateral for loan applications.

   - The **protected group** has considerable instances of process variants like `Request Co-Signer on Loan` happening in intermediate steps, even for final denials.
   - These requests appear **less frequently** for the **unprotected group** at key decision points.
   
   **Interpretation:** Requesting additional procedures like co-signers might suggest a **higher burden** is being placed on the **protected group**, making the process more onerous and complex.

---

### Final Conclusion:
The main differences indicate a **potentially unjust disparity** between treatment:

1. **Protected groups** face longer processing times, partly due to redundant or extra steps (like assessing collateral multiple times or requesting co-signers).
2. **Unprotected groups** tend to experience a **more streamlined**, faster process with **more frequent approvals** and often **skipped examinations**.
3. **Extra scrutiny** in the form of repeated steps, collateral assessment, and co-signer requirements suggests **higher barriers** to approval for the **protected group**, which raises flags for possible unfair or biased treatment.

These findings suggest potential unfairness within the system where the **protected group** may endure more complex and time-consuming processes, appearing biased or burdensome when compared to the more straightforward flow applied to the **unprotected group**.
