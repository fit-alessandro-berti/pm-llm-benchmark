This visualization provides a multi-faceted view of a laboratory workflow process, broken down into three components labeled (a), (b), and (c). It uses a specific modeling notation to illustrate how different sub-processes interact.

Here is a detailed description of each part:

### (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels

This is a process flow diagram that shows two interacting sub-processes, referred to as "proclets": **"Lab visit"** on the left and **"Lab test"** on the right.

*   **Lab visit Proclet (left):** This process is initiated by a "doctor" and primarily managed by a "lab assistant".
    *   It begins with a **start event** for the "Lab visit".
    *   A **doctor** performs an "Order entry".
    *   A **lab assistant** performs "Take blood sample".
    *   The lab assistant then waits to "Receive result" from the Lab test process.
    *   After receiving the result, the lab assistant will "Judge results".
    *   Based on the judgment, there's a decision:
        *   If "Everything fine", a report is sent ("Send report") and the process ends.
        *   If not, a request to "Do tests again" is sent, and the process waits to "Receive updated result" before the cycle potentially repeats or ends.

*   **Lab test Proclet (right):** This process is performed by a "chemical analyst".
    *   It begins with a **start event** for the "Lab test", triggered by the "Order entry" from the Lab visit.
    *   A **chemical analyst** will "Perform test" and then "Make report".
    *   The results are sent back to the Lab visit proclet.
    *   If a re-test is requested, the analyst will "Perform test again" and "Provide updated report".
    *   The process ends after the tasks are completed.

*   **Interaction Channels (middle):** The two proclets are connected via two communication channels, represented by dashed boxes:
    *   **Order system:** This channel is used to send the initial test order from the "Order entry" step in the "Lab visit" to initiate the "Lab test" process.
    *   **HIS (Hospital Information System):** This channel facilitates the exchange of results and re-test requests between the two proclets.

The shaded boxes (e.g., "Receive result", "Finish lab test") likely represent interaction tasks or message-driven events.

### (b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes

This is a simple UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram that defines the structural relationship between the two processes.

*   It shows two classes: **"Lab visit"** and **"Lab test"**.
*   An association line labeled **"requires"** connects them.
*   The numbers (**cardinality**) indicate that one "Lab visit" (`1..1`) requires one or more (`1..*`) "Lab test" instances. This means a single visit to the lab can result in multiple different tests being ordered and performed.

### (c) Example of a performative

This table provides a concrete example of a communication message, called a "performative," that occurs within the process shown in diagram (a).

*   **Time:** 11:00
*   **Channel:** Order system (matching the channel in diagram a)
*   **Sender:** An instance of the "Lab visit" process for a patient named "John".
*   **Receivers:** A new instance of the "Lab test" process, specifically for a Hemoglobin (HGB) test for "John".
*   **Action:** Create (This message creates a new lab test instance).
*   **Content:** "Can you perform a HGB test for John?" (The actual request).
*   **Scope:** Private.
*   **Direction:** OUT (The message is outgoing from the sender's perspective).

In summary, the visualization provides a comprehensive model of a laboratory workflow by showing the dynamic behavior of the processes (a), their static structural relationship (b), and a concrete example of the communication that links them (c).
