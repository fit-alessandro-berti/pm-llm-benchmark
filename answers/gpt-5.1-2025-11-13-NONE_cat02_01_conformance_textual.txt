1. **Which cases violate the normative process?**

- **Conformant:** Case **1**, Case **4**
- **Nonconformant:** Case **2**, Case **3**, Case **5**

---

2. **Explanation per case**

### Case 1  
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Package  Ship  Close  

This matches the “sufficient inventory” path exactly:
- Check inventory after Receive.
- Authorize payment only after Check inventory and before Package.
- Package before Ship.
- No Cancel order.
- Close order is last.

**Result:** No violation.

### Case 2  
Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize payment  Ship  Close  

Violations relative to the normative rules:

1. **Packaging before payment authorization**  
   - Normative text:  
     - “after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment”  
     - “'Authorize payment' should only occur after 'Check inventory' and **before packaging**”  
   - In this case, **Package items** is done **before** **Authorize payment**, violating the ordering constraint.

2. **Ship after incorrectly ordered steps**  
   - “'Ship order' should only occur after packaging” (which is true here), but the packaging itself was done before proper authorization, so the overall fulfillment flow is out of order.

**Result:** Case 2 violates the rule that payment must be authorized before packaging.

---

### Case 3  
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Cancel  Ship  Close  

Violations:

1. **Shipping after cancellation**  
   - Normative text:  
     - “If the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock … proceed to 'Cancel order' … Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)”  
     - “'Ship order' should … never [occur] after a cancellation.”
   - Here, **Ship order** occurs **after** **Cancel order**, which is explicitly prohibited.

2. **Inconsistent branch behavior**  
   - Once **Cancel order** occurs, the remaining valid path should be: **Cancel  Close**.  
   - Instead, the case continues with **Ship order**, mixing cancellation and fulfillment behavior.

(Authorizing payment before Cancel is not directly forbidden, but it is unusual; the clear, explicit violation is shipping after cancellation.)

**Result:** Case 3 violates the rule that no fulfillment activities (especially Ship) may occur after cancellation.

---

### Case 4  
Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  

This matches the “insufficient inventory” path:
- Receive, then Check inventory.
- After Check, directly Cancel order.
- No fulfillment activities (no Authorize, Package, Ship).
- Close as final step.

**Result:** No violation.

---

### Case 5  
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Ship  Close  

Violations:

1. **Skipping packaging before shipping**  
   - Normative text:  
     - “Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'”  
     - “‘Package items’ should only occur after authorization and **before shipping**, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped.”
   - In this case, there is **no 'Package items'** activity at all; **Ship order** happens immediately after **Authorize payment**, violating the required sequence.

2. **Missing mandatory step in the fulfillment scenario**  
   - For sufficient inventory, the expected sequence is: Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Package  Ship  Close.  
   - The **Package items** step is missing, breaking the normative flow.

**Result:** Case 5 violates the rule that packaging must be performed between payment authorization and shipping.

---

**Summary**

- **Conformant cases:** 1, 4  
- **Violating cases and reasons:**  
  - **Case 2:** Packaging occurs before payment authorization.  
  - **Case 3:** Shipping occurs after order cancellation.  
  - **Case 5:** Shipping occurs without prior packaging (missing “Package items” step).
