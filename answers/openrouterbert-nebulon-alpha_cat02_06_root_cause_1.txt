### **Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Delays**

#### **1. Identifying Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**
First, let's calculate the **total resolution time** (time from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket") for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time          | End Time            | Total Resolution Time (Hours) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00    | 2024-03-01 10:15    | **2.25 hours**                |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05    | 2024-03-02 09:15    | **25.17 hours (~1 day 1 hr)** |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10    | 2024-03-01 09:30    | **1.33 hours**                |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20    | 2024-03-02 08:30    | **24.17 hours (~1 day)**      |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25    | 2024-03-03 09:30    | **50.08 hours (~2 days 2 hrs)**|

**Observations:**
- **Fastest cases (101, 103):** Resolved in **< 2.5 hours**.
- **Moderately delayed cases (102, 104):** Resolved in **~1 day**.
- **Most delayed case (105):** Resolved in **~2 days 2 hours**.

**Significantly delayed cases:** **102, 104, 105** (with **105 being the worst**).

#### **2. Root Causes of Performance Issues**
Let’s analyze the **bottlenecks** in the delayed cases:

##### **A. Escalations to Level-2 Agents**
- **Cases with escalations:** **102, 105** (104 did not escalate but still took ~1 day).
- **Impact:**
  - **102:** Escalated at **11:30**, but **Level-2 investigation only started at 14:00** (2.5-hour delay).
  - **105:** Escalated at **10:00**, but **Level-2 investigation only started at 14:00 the next day** (~28-hour delay).
  - **Escalations introduce long waiting times** before the next step (investigation by Level-2).

##### **B. Long Waiting Times Between Activities**
- **102:**
  - **Triage  Assign to Level-1:** 30 min (normal).
  - **Assign  Escalate:** **2.5 hours** (unusually long).
  - **Escalate  Investigate (Level-2):** **2.5 hours** (delay in Level-2 response).
  - **Investigate  Resolve:** **19 hours** (overnight delay, possibly due to shift change or backlog).

- **104:**
  - **Assign  Investigate:** **3.5 hours** (long delay before investigation starts).
  - **Investigate  Resolve:** **19 hours** (overnight delay, similar to 102).

- **105:**
  - **Escalate  Investigate (Level-2):** **28 hours** (extremely long delay, possibly due to Level-2 team being overloaded).
  - **Investigate  Resolve:** **19 hours** (overnight delay).

##### **C. Overnight Delays (Non-Working Hours)**
- **All delayed cases (102, 104, 105)** have **gaps between "Investigate" and "Resolve" that span overnight**.
  - **Possible causes:**
    - **Shift changes** (no one available to continue work).
    - **Backlog** (Level-2 team is overloaded).
    - **Lack of 24/7 support** (tickets sit idle overnight).

##### **D. Unnecessary Delays Before Investigation**
- **104:**
  - **Assign  Investigate:** **3.5 hours** (Level-1 agent took too long to start).
  - **Possible causes:**
    - **Agent multitasking** (handling multiple tickets).
    - **Lack of prioritization** (ticket not flagged as urgent).
    - **System/process inefficiency** (e.g., manual handoffs).

#### **3. How These Factors Increase Cycle Times**
| **Factor**               | **Impact on Resolution Time** | **Example Cases** |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Escalations**          | Adds **2.5+ hours** of waiting for Level-2 response. | 102, 105 |
| **Long waiting times**   | **3+ hours** between steps (e.g., Assign  Investigate). | 102, 104, 105 |
| **Overnight delays**     | **19+ hours** lost due to non-working hours. | 102, 104, 105 |
| **Level-2 backlog**      | **28+ hours** waiting for Level-2 investigation. | 105 |
| **Lack of prioritization** | Level-1 agents take too long to start investigation. | 104 |

---

### **4. Insights & Recommendations**
#### **Key Insights:**
1. **Escalations are a major bottleneck** – Level-2 team has **long response times** (2.5+ hours in 102, 28+ hours in 105).
2. **Overnight delays are unavoidable** – Tickets sit idle for **19+ hours** between shifts.
3. **Level-1 agents sometimes delay investigations** – **3.5 hours** in 104 before starting work.
4. **No clear prioritization** – Some tickets (101, 103) are resolved quickly, while others (102, 104, 105) face delays.

#### **Recommendations:**
| **Issue** | **Recommendation** | **Expected Impact** |
|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Slow Level-2 response** | - **Increase Level-2 staffing** (or cross-train Level-1 agents for basic escalations).<br>- **Implement SLA for escalations** (e.g., Level-2 must respond within 1 hour). | Reduces waiting time for escalated tickets. |
| **Overnight delays** | - **Extend support hours** (e.g., evening/night shifts).<br>- **Automate handoffs** (e.g., auto-assign to next available agent).<br>- **Prioritize urgent tickets** before end of shift. | Reduces idle time between shifts. |
| **Level-1 delays in investigation** | - **Set time limits** (e.g., "Investigate must start within 1 hour of assignment").<br>- **Use AI triage** to auto-prioritize tickets. | Faster initial response. |
| **Lack of visibility into bottlenecks** | - **Implement process mining tools** (e.g., Celonis, Disco) to track delays.<br>- **Dashboard for real-time monitoring** of ticket status. | Helps identify and fix delays proactively. |
| **No clear escalation criteria** | - **Define clear escalation rules** (e.g., "If Level-1 can’t resolve in 2 hours, escalate").<br>- **Automate escalations** based on time thresholds. | Reduces unnecessary delays in escalation. |

### **5. Summary of Findings**
- **Worst-performing cases:** **102, 104, 105** (delays due to escalations, overnight gaps, and slow Level-2 response).
- **Biggest bottlenecks:**
  1. **Escalations to Level-2** (long waiting times).
  2. **Overnight delays** (tickets sit idle for 19+ hours).
  3. **Level-1 delays in starting investigations** (3+ hours in some cases).
- **Recommendations:**
  - **Improve Level-2 response times** (staffing, SLAs).
  - **Extend support hours** (or automate handoffs).
  - **Set time limits for investigations** (1-hour rule).
  - **Use process mining** for real-time monitoring.

By addressing these issues, the support team can **reduce resolution times by 50-70%** (e.g., 105 could have been resolved in **1 day instead of 2+ days**).
