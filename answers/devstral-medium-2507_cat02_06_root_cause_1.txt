### Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process

#### 1. Identifying Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

To identify cases with significantly longer resolution times, we need to calculate the total time taken from receiving the ticket to closing it for each case. Here are the total times for each case:

- **Case 101**: 2 hours 15 minutes
- **Case 102**: 25 hours 10 minutes
- **Case 103**: 1 hour 20 minutes
- **Case 104**: 24 hours 10 minutes
- **Case 105**: 49 hours 5 minutes

From the above, it is clear that **Case 105** has a significantly longer resolution time compared to the others.

#### 2. Determining Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

To determine the potential root causes, we need to analyze the event logs for each case, focusing on the presence of escalations, long waiting times between activities, and unnecessary delays.

- **Case 101**:
  - No escalation.
  - Smooth progression through activities with minimal delays.

- **Case 102**:
  - Escalation to Level-2 Agent.
  - Significant delay between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (2.5 hours).
  - Long waiting time between "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" and "Investigate Issue" (2.5 hours).
  - Long waiting time between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket" (overnight delay).

- **Case 103**:
  - No escalation.
  - Smooth progression through activities with minimal delays.

- **Case 104**:
  - No escalation.
  - Significant delay between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue" (3.5 hours).
  - Long waiting time between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket" (overnight delay).

- **Case 105**:
  - Escalation to Level-2 Agent.
  - Significant delay between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue" (10 minutes).
  - Long waiting time between "Investigate Issue" and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (1 hour).
  - Very long waiting time between "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" and "Investigate Issue" (overnight delay).
  - Long waiting time between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket" (overnight delay).

#### 3. Explaining Identified Factors and Proposing Recommendations

**Identified Factors:**

1. **Escalations**: Cases that require escalation to a Level-2 Agent (Cases 102 and 105) tend to have longer resolution times.
2. **Long Waiting Times**: Significant delays between activities, especially between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue," and between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket."
3. **Overnight Delays**: Cases that span multiple days (Cases 102, 104, and 105) have longer resolution times due to overnight delays.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Improve Escalation Process**: Streamline the escalation process to reduce the time taken to escalate and investigate issues at the Level-2 Agent. This could involve better communication channels or more efficient handoff procedures.
2. **Reduce Waiting Times**: Identify and address bottlenecks that cause long waiting times between activities. This could involve better resource allocation, training for Level-1 Agents to handle more complex issues, or implementing automated tools to assist in investigation.
3. **Minimize Overnight Delays**: Implement a system to ensure that tickets are not left unresolved overnight. This could involve having a 24/7 support team or a system to prioritize tickets that are close to resolution.
4. **Monitor and Analyze Performance**: Continuously monitor the performance of the support process and analyze event logs to identify and address any new bottlenecks or delays.

By addressing these factors, the customer support ticket resolution process can be optimized to reduce cycle times and improve overall performance.
