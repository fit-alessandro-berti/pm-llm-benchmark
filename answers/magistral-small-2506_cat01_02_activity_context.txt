### Analysis of the Event Log

The event log shows that certain activities (e.g., "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer") appear multiple times within the same case, but their meanings differ based on their position in the process and the associated context. Below is the revised event log with renamed activities to reflect their contextual differences.

### Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Verify Documents**:
   - "Initial Document Verification" is the first verification step where documents are checked after submission.
   - "Reverify Documents" is a subsequent verification after additional documents are submitted or adjustments are made.

2. **Call Customer**:
   - "Initial Call (Missing Docs)" is used when the purpose is to request missing documents.
   - "Initial Call (Account Issue)" is used when the purpose is to clarify account discrepancies.
   - "Follow-up Call" is used when the purpose is to confirm adjustments made after a prior call.

3. **Submit Additional Documents**:
   - Renamed to clarify that this is a customer action to upload missing or additional documents.

4. **Adjust Account**:
   - Retained as is since it is internally performed and does not repeat in the same case.

5. **Initiate Request** and **Approve Request**:
   - These activities are unique in their context and do not repeat, so their names remain unchanged.

The revised names now clearly reflect the contextual differences of the activities, improving the clarity of the process flow.
