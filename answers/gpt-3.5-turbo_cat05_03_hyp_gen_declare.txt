### Anomalies Identified:

1. The **Existence Constraint** states that the activity "C (Close Claim)" must always happen, which contradicts the **Precedence Constraint** that mandates "C" can only occur after "R (Receive Claim)".
   
2. The **Responded Existence Constraint** specifies that activity "E (Evaluate Claim)" should always follow activity "A (Assign Adjuster)", but this contradicts the **Noncoexistence Constraint** that states "E" should not occur with "C (Close Claim)".

### Hypotheses for Anomalies:

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Requirements**: There might have been confusion or oversight regarding the sequence of steps required for claim processing, leading to contradictory rules being included in the model.

2. **Evolution of Policies without Consistent Updates**: Changes in claim processing policies over time may have resulted in new steps being added or modified without updating the DECLARE model accordingly, causing inconsistencies.

### Proposed Verification Approaches:

1. To check for claims closed without evaluation:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT c.*
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
   AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce2 WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'E');
   ```

2. To find traces where evaluation and closing coexist:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.claim_id
   FROM claim_events ce
   WHERE ce.activity IN ('E', 'C')
   GROUP BY ce.claim_id
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) > 1;
   ```

3. To verify if evaluation steps always correspond with assigned adjusters:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, a.adjuster_id
   FROM claims c
   LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON a.name = ce.resource
   WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
   AND ce.resource NOT IN (SELECT name FROM adjusters WHERE specialization = 'auto');
   ```
