A compact way to write the complete model is to keep one big root-sequence ( -> ) and simply hang all other constructs underneath it.  
With that approach the process tree that exactly fits the specification is  

```
-> (
    /* 1 – patient arrives, registers, gets intake assessment         */
    -> ( 'A', 'RG', 'IA' ),

    /* 2 – triage interview and classification                        */
    -> ( 'TI', 'TC' ),

    /* 3 – initial diagnostic: ECG  xor  Blood Panel                  */
    X  ( 'CE', 'FBP' ),

    /* 4 – abnormal-results loop                                      *
     *     tau guarantees that the loop may be executed 0,1,… times   */
    *  ( tau,
         -> ( 'SC',
              X  ( 'TM', 'SPT' ),
              'RDT',
              X  ( 'FCE', 'FBA' )
            )
       ),

    /* 5 – imaging and nutritional counselling in true concurrency    */
    +  ( 'AI', 'NC' ),

    /* 6 – schedule follow-up then give discharge instructions        */
    -> ( 'FAS', 'DDI' ),

    /* 7 – final clearances done in parallel                          */
    +  ( 'BL', 'ICP', 'MRF' )
)
```

Interpretation of the tree:

1. A  RG  IA(patient reaches reception, registers, gets an intake assessment)  
2. TI  TC(triage interview and priority classification)  
3. CE xor FBP(exclusive choice of the first diagnostic test)  
4. The loop “* ( tau , … )” can be taken zero or more times:  
   • one iteration executes  
     SC  ( TM xor SPT )  RDT  ( FCE xor FBA )  
   • after each iteration the model silently (tau) decides whether to iterate again or to exit.  
5. AI || NC(advanced imaging and nutritional counselling run in parallel)  
6. FAS  DDI(schedule follow-up, give detailed discharge instructions)  
7. BL || ICP || MRF(billing, insurance claim processing and record finalisation all run concurrently)  

When every branch of the root sequence has finished, the patient’s process is complete.
