Step 1 – Compute total case duration  
(starttofinish, rounded):

• 2001      1 h 30 m  
• 2002     25 h 55 m  ( 1.1 days)  
• 2003     48 h 20 m  ( 2.0 days)  
• 2004     1 h 25 m  
• 2005    101 h 05 m ( 4.2 days)

“Slow” cases = 2002, 2003, 2005.


Step 2 – Attribute patterns behind the slow cases

1. Complexity
   • Low complexity (2001, 2004) finishes in 1.5 h.  
   • Medium complexity (2002) already triples the flow time.  
   • High complexity (2003, 2005) multiplies it by 30–70×.  
    High/medium complexity clearly correlates with long lead times.

2. “Request Additional Documents” frequency
   • #RAD events per case  
     – Low: 0(2001, 2004)  
     – Medium: 1(2002)  
     – High: 2(2003), 3 (2005)  
   • Waiting for customers to supply documents is the single biggest
     calendar-time gap.  
    The more RAD events, the longer the case.

3. Region
   • Region A: one fast (2001) and one slow (2003).  
   • Region B: one fast (2004) and two slow (2002, 2005).  
   • Region alone is not decisive, but Region B is over-represented
     in the slow cohort (2/3 slow cases).

4. Resource (role-level)
   • Adjusters  
     – Mike (A): 2 RAD events  2-day case (2003).  
     – Lisa (B): 1 or 3 RAD events  1- or 4-day cases (2002, 2005).  
      Both adjusters trigger RAD on non-low complexity, but
        Lisa’s cases show the highest RAD count.  
   • Managers  
     – Ann handles only low/medium, clears them quickly.  
     – Bill handles only high, approval comes 24 h after last RAD.  
      Manager_Bill’s queue adds another full day on high complexity.  


Step 3 – Likely root causes

A. Intrinsic claim complexity  
   • High complexity requires more evidence; adjusters must clarify
     several points  multiple RAD loops  long customer waiting time.

B. Documentation quality gap (Region B & High complexity)  
   • Region B claimants appear to need more iterations to provide
     acceptable evidence (3 RAD in case 2005). Possible reasons:
      Customers unfamiliar with documentation requirements.  
      Local brokers sending incomplete files.

C. Resource-level workload or specialization  
   • Manager_Bill is the bottleneck for high-complexity approvals
     (24 h lag after final RAD).  
   • Adjuster_Lisa’s RAD frequency suggests either stricter quality
     checks or less clarity in initial communication to customers.


Step 4 – Recommendations

1. Reduce RAD loops  
   a. Provide a “claim-starter kit” that lists all required
      documents for each complexity level.  
   b. Let the CSR verify completeness at “Submit Claim” by using a
      checklist; incomplete packages are rejected immediately.

2. Fast-track high-complexity approvals  
   a. Add a second senior manager who can approve high-complexity
      claims when Manager_Bill’s queue exceeds an 8-hour threshold.  
   b. Introduce an SLA dashboard so Bill sees aging cases in real time.

3. Coaching for Adjusters  
   • Compare Mike vs. Lisa: why does Lisa ask for more iterations?
     – Run a root-cause session, share best-practice wording for
       evidence requests, and create templates to avoid back-and-forth.

4. Regional enablement  
   • Hold a webinar for Region B brokers/customers focusing on the
     most frequently missing documents.  
   • Allow electronic document upload with automated format checks
     to flag issues instantly instead of after hours.

5. Ongoing monitoring  
   • Track for every case: complexity, #RAD events, waiting time
     per activity, resource queue time.  
   • Set alert rules (e.g., if a case has 2 RADs or waits 12 h for
     approval) to trigger escalation.

With these actions the organisation can shrink the extra 1-4 days now consumed by medium/high-complexity claims and achieve more consistent lead times across regions and resources.
