Here is an updated DECLARE model that adds fairness-oriented constraints around sensitive-attribute checks and decision-making steps. I’ve preserved the original constraints and inserted new ones that (i) require a BiasMitigationCheck after any sensitive attribute check and before any decision, (ii) forbid immediate decisions right after sensitive checks, and (iii) ensure ManualReview is tightly coupled to decisions explicitly tagged as involving sensitive demographics.

Updated model:
```python

    },
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "CheckApplicantGender": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},

        },
        "CheckApplicantAge": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    }
}
```

Rationale for the added constraints:
- response(CheckApplicant[Race|Gender|Age] -> BiasMitigationCheck): Ensures that whenever a sensitive attribute is checked, a BiasMitigationCheck must occur afterward, making bias auditing explicit post-attribute access.
- precedence(Approve/Reject/FinalDecision <- BiasMitigationCheck): Forces any decision to be preceded by a BiasMitigationCheck, ensuring decisions are not made without documented mitigation.
- nonchainsuccession(CheckApplicant[Race|Gender|Age], Approve/Reject/FinalDecision): Prevents a decision from happening immediately after a sensitive check, reducing the risk of snap judgments based solely on sensitive attributes.
- coexistence(ManualReview, Approve_Minority/Reject_Minority): Requires ManualReview to appear in any trace that includes a decision explicitly tagged as involving a sensitive demographic and vice versa, promoting consistent oversight when sensitive demographics are implicated.
- chainprecedence(Approve_Minority/Reject_Minority <- ManualReview): Strengthens oversight by requiring ManualReview to occur immediately before such sensitive decisions, ensuring a human check directly precedes the outcome.

Notes:
- The activities Approve_Minority and Reject_Minority reflect decision events explicitly tagged as involving sensitive demographics. If your event log uses different labels, adapt these accordingly (e.g., Decision_SensitiveDemographic). The constraints above remain applicable with renamed activities.
