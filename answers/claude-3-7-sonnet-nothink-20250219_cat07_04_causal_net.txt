This image shows a Petri net or workflow diagram representing a business process, likely for handling requests or claims.

The main diagram illustrates a process flow with several states (represented by squares) and transitions (represented by arrows with black dots):

- The process begins at state "a" (register request)
- From there, it can branch to multiple paths:
  - "b" (examine thoroughly)
  - "c" (examine casually)
  - "d" (check ticket)
  - "f" (reinitiate request)
- These paths eventually converge at state "e" (decide)
- After the decision, the process can go to:
  - "g" (pay compensation)
  - "h" (reject request)
- Both paths end at state "z" (end)

The gray box in the bottom right shows different types of gateway patterns used in process modeling:
- XOR-split/join: Exclusive choice (only one path is taken)
- AND-split/join: Parallel execution (all paths are taken)
- OR-split/join: Inclusive choice (one or more paths can be taken)

This appears to be a business process model that might be used in workflow management systems, business process modeling, or process mining. It represents how a request flows through various examination and decision stages before reaching a final outcome (payment or rejection).
