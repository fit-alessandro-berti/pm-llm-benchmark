Certainly! The process you've described appears to be an approval and payment workflow for declarations (likely expense reports or similar documentation) within an organization. Here's a step-by-step description of the process:

1. **Declaration Submission by Employee:**
   - An employee submits a declaration. This is the starting point of the process.
   - The declaration can then follow several paths:
     - **Direct Final Approval by Supervisor:**
       - The declaration is directly final approved by the supervisor (frequency = 1536, performance = 81928.554).
     - **Approval by Administration:**
       - The declaration is approved by the administration (frequency = 8202, performance = 99860.580).
         - **Final Approval by Supervisor:**
           - The approved declaration is then final approved by the supervisor (frequency = 5133, performance = 164330.770).
         - **Approval by Budget Owner:**
           - The approved declaration is then approved by the budget owner (frequency = 2820, performance = 163968.943).
             - **Final Approval by Supervisor:**
               - The approved declaration is final approved by the supervisor (frequency = 2788, performance = 247457.498).
     - **Approval by Pre-Approver:**
       - The declaration is approved by a pre-approver (frequency = 685, performance = 107260.731).
         - **Final Approval by Supervisor:**
           - The approved declaration is then final approved by the supervisor (frequency = 674, performance = 163158.794).
     - **Rejection:**
       - The declaration can be rejected by various entities:
         - **Administration:**
           - The declaration is rejected by the administration (frequency = 952, performance = 489246.007).
             - **Resubmission by Employee:**
               - The rejected declaration is resubmitted by the employee (frequency = 928, performance = 176566.949).
         - **Pre-Approver:**
           - The declaration is rejected by the pre-approver (frequency = 86, performance = 168235.221).
             - **Resubmission by Employee:**
               - The rejected declaration is resubmitted by the employee (frequency = 85, performance = 124121.706).
         - **Budget Owner:**
           - The declaration is rejected by the budget owner (frequency = 59, performance = 110850.288).
             - **Resubmission by Employee:**
               - The rejected declaration is resubmitted by the employee (frequency = 58, performance = 184527.828).
         - **Supervisor:**
           - The declaration is rejected by the supervisor (frequency = 190, performance = 189435.458).
             - **Resubmission by Employee:**
               - The rejected declaration is resubmitted by the employee (frequency = 286, performance = 318191.829).
         - **Employee:**
           - The declaration is rejected by the employee (frequency = 7, performance = 17.143).
     - **For Approval:**
       - The declaration can be marked for approval by different entities before further processing:
         - **Supervisor:**
           - The declaration is marked for approval by the supervisor (frequency = 1, performance = 3.000).
             - **Rejection by Missing:**
               - The declaration is rejected by a missing entity (frequency = 1, performance = 68567.000).
         - **Pre-Approver:**
           - The declaration is marked for approval by the pre-approver (frequency = 1, performance = 170.000).
             - **Rejection by Missing:**
               - The declaration is rejected by a missing entity (frequency = 1, performance = 353446.000).
         - **Administration:**
           - The declaration is marked for approval by the administration (frequency = 1, performance = 589.000).
             - **Resubmission by Employee:**
               - The declaration is resubmitted by the employee (frequency = 1, performance = 87824.000).

2. **Final Approval by Supervisor:**
   - Once the declaration is final approved by the supervisor, it can proceed to the next steps:
     - **Request Payment:**
       - The final approved declaration triggers a request for payment (frequency = 10038, performance = 273266.628).
         - **Payment Handled:**
           - The payment is handled (frequency = 10037, performance = 308848.058).
         - **Rejection by Missing:**
           - The declaration is rejected by a missing entity (frequency = 3, performance = 1640403.667).
     - **Rejection by Missing:**
       - The final approved declaration is rejected by a missing entity (frequency = 86, performance = 952809.512).

3. **Rejection and Resubmission:**
   - If the declaration is rejected at any point, it can be resubmitted by the employee:
     - **Resubmission by Employee:**
       - The rejected declaration is resubmitted by the employee (frequency = 1081, performance = 447425.560).

4. **Special Cases:**
   - There are a few special cases:
     - **Saved by Employee to Request Payment:**
       - The declaration is saved by the employee and directly triggers a request for payment (frequency = 1, performance = 1471681.000).
     - **Rejection by Missing to Request Payment:**
       - The declaration is rejected by a missing entity and then a request for payment is made (frequency = 1, performance = 598089.000).
     - **Payment Handled to Rejection by Employee:**
       - After the payment is handled, the declaration is rejected by the employee (frequency = 1, performance = 140424.000).

This process involves multiple approval steps and rejections, with the possibility of resubmission and special handling for certain cases. The performance metrics (times in milliseconds) provide insights into the efficiency of each step.
