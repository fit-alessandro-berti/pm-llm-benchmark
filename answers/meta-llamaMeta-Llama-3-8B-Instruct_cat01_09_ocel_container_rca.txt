Based on the provided data, here are some potential root causes for the performance issues in the process:

1. **Truck utilization**: The average duration per event for "Load Truck" is 7820.93, which is a significant time spent on loading trucks. This could indicate that trucks might not be utilized efficiently, leading to idle time and potential bottlenecks.
2. **Container allocation**: The high frequency of events involving Container objects (e.g., "Order Empty Containers", "Pick Up Empty Container", "Load Truck") and the long durations associated with these events (e.g., 368943.92, 38659.62) might indicate inefficient container allocation or management processes.
3. **Forklift usage**: The frequency and duration of events involving Forklift objects (e.g., "Bring to Loading Bay", "Load to Vehicle", "Weigh") suggest that forklifts might be used more frequently than necessary, leading to potential congestion or delays in the process.
4. **Vehicle allocation**: The high frequency of events involving Vehicle objects (e.g., "Book Vehicles", "Load to Vehicle", "Depart") might indicate inefficient vehicle allocation or management processes. The long durations associated with these events (e.g., 295965.56) could suggest that vehicles are not being utilized efficiently.
5. **Terminal operations**: The events involving "Drive to Terminal" and "Weigh" suggest that there might be inefficiencies in terminal operations, such as congestion, delays, or inadequate equipment.
6. **Container rescheduling**: The high frequency of events involving Container rescheduling (e.g., "Reschedule Container") and the long durations associated with these events (e.g., 40895.81) might indicate that there are issues with container rescheduling processes, such as incorrect priority setting or inadequate information flow.

These are just process and data-specific considerations, not general considerations. Further analysis and investigation would be necessary to determine the root causes of the performance issues and to develop targeted solutions.
