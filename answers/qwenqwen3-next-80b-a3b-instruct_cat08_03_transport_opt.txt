### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

**Data Preprocessing and Integration**

To construct a unified event log suitable for process mining, the following preprocessing steps are essential:

- **Data Normalization**: Standardize timestamps to UTC, unify location formats (e.g., convert all GPS coordinates to WGS84), and map activity labels across systems (e.g., “Arrive Customer” from scanner = “Stop Arrived” in GPS if tagged).
- **Case ID Alignment**: The primary case identifier is *Vehicle-Day* (e.g., V12-20241205). All events must be linked to this case via Vehicle ID and Date. Package-level events (e.g., Delivery Success) are nested under the vehicle-day case but retain Package ID for granular analysis.
- **Event Enrichment**: 
  - Merge GPS speed and location data with scanner events to infer travel segments between stops.
  - Join dispatch data to assign planned stop sequences, time windows, and capacity utilization per case.
  - Overlay maintenance logs as “unscheduled events” with root cause tags (e.g., “Engine Failure,” “Brake Issue”) linked to vehicle ID and timestamp.
- **Handling Missing Data**: 
  - If GPS data is sparse, interpolate locations between scanner events using speed and time deltas (with confidence intervals).
  - For missing driver IDs, infer from shift logs or historical assignments.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Temporal Alignment**: GPS data may record every 10–30 seconds, while scanner events are sparse. Interpolation risks error if vehicle is idle or in tunnels.
  - **Event Ambiguity**: “Low Speed Detected” (GPS) vs. “Arrive Customer” (scanner) may not align perfectly. We resolve this by matching GPS low-speed events (<10 km/h) within a 5-minute window of scanner “Arrive” events.
  - **Data Silos**: Maintenance logs may be in a separate CRM system; API integration or ETL pipelines are needed for automation.
  - **Duplicate/Noise Events**: Driver may scan twice by accident; deduplication using timestamp proximity and activity type is required.

**Process Discovery**

Using process discovery algorithms (e.g., **Alpha Miner**, **Heuristic Miner**, or **Inductive Miner**), we construct an *actual* process model from the enriched event log. The model captures:

- **Start**: “Depart Depot”  Sequence of “Arrive Customer”  “Delivery Success/Failure”  “Depart Customer”  End: “Arrive Depot”
- **Branches**: 
  - “Delivery Failed”  “Return to Depot” or “Re-attempt Later” (if rescheduled)
  - “Unscheduled Stop”  “Repair”  “Resume Route” or “End Shift Early”
- **Loops**: Repeated “Arrive-Depart” at same location (indicating failed delivery attempts or circling for parking).
- **Parallel Paths**: Multiple packages delivered at same stop (clustered by location).

The output is a **directed graph** with annotated transitions (e.g., average dwell time, frequency of deviation). Visualization tools like **ProM** or **Celonis** will render this as an intuitive flowchart showing the dominant process variant and outliers.

**Conformance Checking**

We compare the discovered “as-is” model against the “to-be” planned routes from the dispatch system using **conformance checking algorithms** (e.g., **Alignment-Based Conformance Checking**):

- **Planned Model**: A linear sequence of stops with assigned time windows and expected durations.
- **Deviations Detected**:
  - **Sequence Deviations**: Driver skips Stop 3 and does Stop 5 first  violates route plan.
  - **Unplanned Stops**: “Unscheduled Stop” events not in dispatch plan  12% of cases had 1+ such stops.
  - **Timing Deviations**: 
    - Average arrival at Stop 7 is 42 minutes late vs. planned window.
    - 30% of deliveries occurred outside customer time windows.
  - **Missing Activities**: “Depart Customer” not logged after “Delivery Success”  data capture gap.
  - **Excessive Loops**: 15% of failed deliveries resulted in 2+ return attempts to same location  inefficient re-routing.

Conformance results are quantified via **fitness** (how well traces fit the model) and **precision** (how much of the model is actually observed). Low fitness (<0.75) indicates high deviation. We identify “deviation hotspots” — e.g., Route 12 has 68% non-conformance due to traffic-induced reordering.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

| KPI | Calculation | Data Sources |
|-----|-------------|--------------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR)** | % of deliveries completed within customer time window | Scanner + Dispatch |
| **Average Time per Delivery Stop** | (Total time from “Arrive Customer” to “Depart Customer”) / # deliveries | Scanner + GPS |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio** | Total moving time / Total dwell time | GPS (moving) + Scanner (dwell) |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/package** | (Fuel usage estimate from idle/moving time × avg. consumption rate) / # packages | GPS (idle/moving) + Dispatch (package count) |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | (Time from “Depart Depot” to “Arrive Depot”) / (Shift Duration) | Driver + Vehicle Logs |
| **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays** | # events where speed < 10 km/h for >5 min, avg. duration | GPS Speed + Location |
| **Failed Delivery Rate** | # Failed Deliveries / # Scheduled Deliveries | Scanner |
| **Re-delivery Rate** | # Re-attempts / # Failed Deliveries | Scanner + Dispatch (rescheduled packages) |

*Example Calculation*:  
If a vehicle spends 4 hours driving and 3 hours at stops delivering 35 packages, Travel:Service ratio = 4:3 = 1.33. Industry benchmark is ~1.5–2.0; lower ratios suggest inefficient routing or excessive dwell.

**Bottleneck Identification Techniques**

- **Variant Analysis**: Cluster delivery routes into variants (e.g., 5 dominant variants out of 1200 daily routes). Identify which variant has highest average delay or lowest OTDR.
- **Bottleneck Heatmaps**: Use **Dotted Chart** (timestamp vs. activity) to visualize delays. For example, if “Arrive Customer” events cluster after 10:00 AM on Route 8, it indicates morning congestion bottleneck.
- **Resource Analysis**: Compare KPIs by Driver ID or Vehicle ID. Driver D105 has 2.5x more failed deliveries than D102 — investigate behavior or territory.
- **Footprint Analysis**: Overlay GPS heatmaps of low-speed events on city maps to identify traffic hotspots (e.g., intersection at 50.79N, 6.15E has 47 low-speed events).
- **Duration Analysis**: Use **Process Mining with Time Attributes** to find activities with longest median duration. Result: “Customer Interaction” (Arrive to Depart) averages 5.2 min, but 15% of stops exceed 12 min — likely due to unprepared drivers or complex delivery instructions.

**Quantifying Impact**:  
A 1-minute reduction in average dwell time across 500 daily stops saves 8.3 hours/day. If fuel cost is $0.50/km and average idle speed is 0 km/h, reducing 30 minutes of daily idle time per vehicle saves $12/day/vehicle  $36,000/year fleet-wide.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

Beyond identifying *where* delays occur, process mining enables deep root cause analysis:

| Potential Root Cause | Process Mining Validation Method |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Suboptimal Route Planning** | Compare planned vs. actual route sequences. If 70% of routes are reordered due to traffic, static routing is inadequate. |
| **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations** | Compare planned vs. actual travel time between consecutive stops. If planned = 8 min, actual = 15 min on Route 3, estimation model is flawed. |
| **Traffic Congestion Patterns** | Correlate low-speed events with time-of-day and calendar data (e.g., 8–9 AM on weekdays = 90% of delays). Use **cross-case analysis** to map delays to road segments. |
| **High Variability in Service Time** | Box plots of “dwell time” per customer location. Some addresses have 2–10 min dwell; others 15–30 min. Cluster by property type (apartment vs. house) or delivery complexity (signature required, large item). |
| **Vehicle Breakdowns During Shift** | Link “Unscheduled Stop” events with maintenance logs. If 40% of breakdowns occur between 11 AM–1 PM (peak delivery), vehicle age or load stress is causal. |
| **Driver Behavior Differences** | Compare high/low performers. Driver D105 has 20% higher dwell time but same route as D102 — observe if D105 waits for calls, scans slowly, or takes detours. Use **resource behavior analysis**. |
| **Failed Delivery Attempts** | Trace failed delivery  re-attempt  successful delivery path. If re-attempt occurs next day, cost doubles. If driver retries same day, was it due to poor time window prediction? |

**Validation Example**:  
- **Hypothesis**: Failed deliveries are due to incorrect time windows.  
- **Test**: Filter cases where delivery failed, then check if customer’s requested window was “9 AM–12 PM” but driver arrived at 1:15 PM. If 80% of failures align with missed windows, root cause is dispatch planning, not customer behavior.  
- **Variant Comparison**: High-performing drivers (OTDR > 90%) have 30% fewer failed deliveries and 20% shorter dwell times — their routes are optimized for high-density clusters, not linear sequences.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Route Re-optimization Engine Based on Real-Time Traffic and Historical Dwell Patterns**

- **Targets**: High traffic delays, long dwell times, missed time windows.
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Static routing ignores real-time congestion and variable customer service times.
- **Process Mining Support**: 
  - Identified 5 high-delay corridors (e.g., Main St, 8–10 AM).
  - Found 20 customer locations with >10 min average dwell (e.g., apartment complexes requiring elevator access).
- **Implementation**: 
  - Integrate live traffic API (e.g., Google Maps, TomTom) into dispatch system.
  - Use **re-routing algorithm** that reorders stops in real-time based on:
    - Current traffic speed on next segment.
    - Historical dwell time at next stop.
    - Remaining time window.
  - Example: If Stop 5 (high-dwell) is ahead of Stop 4 (low-dwell, 5-min window), swap order if traffic delay exceeds 8 min.
- **Expected Impact**: 
  -  OTDR by 15–20%  
  -  Travel time by 12%  
  -  Failed deliveries by 25% (due to better timing)

**Strategy 2: Territory Re-alignment and Route Clustering Based on Performance Variants**

- **Targets**: Inefficient route sequences, underutilized vehicles, excessive mileage.
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Routes assigned arbitrarily, not based on spatial density or performance history.
- **Process Mining Support**: 
  - Variant analysis revealed 3 dominant route patterns: “Dense Urban Core,” “Suburban Sprawl,” “Mixed High-Dwell.” 
  - Vehicles assigned to “Suburban Sprawl” routes had 40% higher fuel cost and 25% lower OTDR.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Cluster customers into **geo-fenced territories** using DBSCAN on delivery locations.
  - Assign vehicles to territories based on:
    - Historical success rate (OTDR) of driver/vehicle in that zone.
    - Average package density.
    - Vehicle capacity (e.g., larger vans to high-density zones).
  - Reassign drivers to optimize zone familiarity.
- **Expected Impact**: 
  -  Avg. daily mileage by 18%  
  -  Vehicle utilization rate from 72% to 85%  
  -  Fuel cost per package by 14%

**Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance and Failed Delivery Reduction via Dwell-Time and Vehicle Health Correlation**

- **Targets**: Unscheduled breakdowns, re-delivery costs.
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Maintenance scheduled monthly, not condition-based; failed deliveries due to poor scheduling, not customer unavailability.
- **Process Mining Support**: 
  - Vehicles with >10 unscheduled stops had 3x higher fuel consumption and 40% higher maintenance cost.
  - Failed deliveries clustered at locations with dwell time >10 min — suggesting driver spends extra time verifying delivery, possibly due to unclear instructions.
- **Implementation**: 
  - **Predictive Maintenance**: Use **survival analysis** on GPS data: 
    - Correlate engine warning events with total idle time, engine RPM variance, and distance since last service. 
    - Trigger maintenance alert if: idle time > 4 hrs/day + speed variance > 20% + >2000 km since last service.
  - **Failed Delivery Reduction**: 
    - Send SMS to customer 30 min before arrival if dwell time at that location historically exceeds 7 min (e.g., “Driver will arrive at 10:15 — please be ready”).
    - Flag high-risk addresses for “contactless” or “secure drop” options.
- **Expected Impact**: 
  -  Unscheduled stops by 50%  
  -  Re-delivery rate by 30%  
  -  Maintenance cost by 20% (preventive vs. reactive)

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

**Operational Constraint Integration**

All optimization strategies must respect:

- **Driver Working Hours**: Dynamic re-routing must not exceed 10-hour shifts (legal limit). Use **time window constraints** in routing engine to cap total shift duration.
- **Vehicle Capacity**: Route optimizer must ensure total package weight/volume  vehicle max. Use **bin-packing algorithms** in route generation.
- **Customer Time Windows**: Re-routing must preserve hard windows (e.g., “9–11 AM”) — soft windows (e.g., “1–5 PM”) can be relaxed. Process mining identifies which windows are most frequently missed  prioritize hard ones.

**Continuous Monitoring via Process Mining Dashboards**

Post-implementation, deploy a **real-time process mining dashboard** (e.g., Celonis, UiPath Process Mining) with:

| Dashboard View | Key Metrics Tracked | Purpose |
|----------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Live Process Map** | Real-time trace of all active deliveries, color-coded by conformance (green = on-plan, red = deviated) | Spot deviations instantly |
| **KPI Performance Tracker** | OTDR, Fuel per km, Failed Delivery Rate, Dwell Time — daily/weekly trend lines | Monitor impact of changes |
| **Bottleneck Heatmap** | Heatmap of traffic delays and high-dwell locations by day/time | Identify new congestion zones |
| **Driver/Variant Leaderboard** | Top 5 and bottom 5 drivers by OTDR, dwell time, fuel efficiency | Drive accountability and training |
| **Maintenance Alert Log** | Predictive alerts with confidence score and vehicle ID | Enable proactive service |
| **Re-delivery Root Cause Drilldown** | % failed due to “customer not home” vs. “wrong time window” vs. “package damage” | Refine customer comms strategy |

**Sustainability & Feedback Loop**:

- Weekly process mining reviews with operations team.
- Monthly re-training based on top 3 inefficient variants.
- A/B testing: Roll out new route logic to 20% of fleet first; compare KPIs vs. control group.
- Automate alerts: If OTDR drops below 85% for 3 consecutive days, trigger root cause investigation.
