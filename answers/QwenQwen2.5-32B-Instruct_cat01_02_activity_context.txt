To accurately reflect the contextual differences in the process events, we need to rename the activities based on their specific roles and the context in which they occur. Here is the revised event log with renamed activities:

```  
| Case ID | Activity                         | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |

### Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Initial Document Verification**: This activity represents the first verification of documents when the request is initiated. The context is that the agent is checking the identity documents for the first time.
   
2. **Re-verify Documents**: This activity occurs when the documents need to be verified again after the customer has submitted additional or corrected documents. The context here is that the verification is being done a second time to ensure all necessary documents are correct.

3. **Call Customer for Missing Docs**: This specific call is made when the initial verification finds missing documents. The context is that the agent needs to request additional documents from the customer.

4. **Call Customer for Clarification**: This call is made to clarify discrepancies or to provide information needed for further processing. The context is that the customer needs to be contacted for more specific details or clarifications.

5. **Follow-up Call**: This indicates a call made after an adjustment or clarification to confirm that the customer understands or agrees with the changes made.

6. **Adjust Account Details**: This activity is done after the clarification call to make internal adjustments to the account. The context is internal processing after communication with the customer.

7. **Adjust Account Due to Missing Info**: This is an adjustment activity due to missing information, specifically in the context of a walk-in customer who needs additional information or correction.

8. **Call Customer to Return**: This is a specific call made because the customer has stepped out and needs to be contacted to return to the branch. The context is to ensure the customer returns to complete the process.

These changes ensure that each activity name clearly reflects its specific role in the process and removes any ambiguity that could arise from repeated activity names.
