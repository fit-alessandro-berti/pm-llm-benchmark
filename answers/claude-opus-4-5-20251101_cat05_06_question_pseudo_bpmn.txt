# 20 Thought-Provoking Questions on the Smartphone Supply Chain Process

## Process Rationale & Design

1. **Why was the decision made to source components from four different geographic regions, and how does this geographic diversification balance cost efficiency against supply chain complexity and risk exposure?**

2. **What criteria determined that Malaysia was selected as the assembly location, and how might shifting labor costs, trade agreements, or geopolitical factors prompt reconsideration of this choice?**

3. **Why does the process position market research as a single upstream task rather than an ongoing parallel activity, and what insights might be lost by not integrating continuous market feedback throughout the supply chain?**

## Risk Management

4. **Given the concentration of critical components (microprocessors, OLED screens) in specific countries, what contingency plans exist if a natural disaster, pandemic, or political disruption halts production in Taiwan or South Korea?**

5. **How does the organization assess and mitigate the "single point of failure" risk at the Malaysia assembly plant, and should redundant assembly capabilities be established elsewhere?**

6. **What early warning indicators are monitored to anticipate customs delays or regulatory changes across different markets, and how quickly can the process adapt to sudden policy shifts?**

## Decision-Making Logic

7. **What specific metrics or thresholds trigger the exclusive gateway decision between air freight for high-demand markets versus cargo shipping, and how are these thresholds recalibrated seasonally?**

8. **In the quality control gateway, what defect rate percentage justifies scrapping versus reworking, and who holds authority to make this cost-impact decision in real-time?**

9. **How is "demand stability" quantitatively defined at the final exclusive gateway, and what degree of variance triggers supplier order adjustments versus proceeding normally?**

## Stakeholder Communication

10. **How is information shared in real-time among component suppliers across four different time zones and cultures, and what communication breakdowns have historically caused delays?**

11. **What mechanisms ensure that retailers, e-commerce fulfillment teams, and VIP shipment handlers receive synchronized, accurate information about inventory availability and delivery timelines?**

12. **How are quality failures and rework decisions communicated upstream to component suppliers to drive accountability and continuous improvement?**

## Performance Measurement

13. **Beyond traditional metrics like lead time and cost-per-unit, what innovative KPIs could capture the true agility and resilience of this multinational supply chain?**

14. **How is the effectiveness of the parallel gateway synchronization measured—specifically, what is the cost of idle time when one component arrives significantly before others?**

15. **What methodology is used to measure customer satisfaction across the four distinct distribution channels (retailers, e-commerce, VIP, warehousing), and are these metrics comparable?**

## Potential Improvements

16. **Could the sequential flow from market research through R&D prototype design be restructured into concurrent engineering practices, and what barriers prevent this integration?**

17. **What opportunities exist to implement predictive analytics or machine learning at the inventory monitoring stage to anticipate demand shifts before they manifest in sales data?**

18. **How might blockchain technology or digital twins enhance transparency, traceability, and trust across this multi-tier, multinational supplier network?**

## Strategic & Ethical Considerations

19. **What sustainability and carbon footprint considerations are embedded (or absent) in the choice between air freight and cargo shipping, and how should environmental impact factor into these routing decisions?**

20. **As the process spans multiple countries with varying labor standards and regulations, how does the organization ensure ethical compliance throughout the supply chain, and where are the blind spots in current oversight?**
