Upon analyzing the provided process variants and their corresponding frequencies and performance times for both the protected and unprotected groups, the following differences can be observed:

1. Extensive screening process: The protected group undergoes more extensive screening compared to the unprotected group. This is evident in the process variants that include the "Extensive Screening" step, which occurs more frequently and with higher performance times in the protected group.
2. Rejection rates: The protected group seems to have a higher rejection rate during the application process compared to the unprotected group. This can be inferred from the higher frequency and performance times associated with the "Reject Prospective Tenant" step in the protected group's process variants.
3. Rent payment history: The protected group appears to have a more complex rent payment history than the unprotected group. This can be seen in the process variants where the protected group has multiple "Pay Rent" steps before the tenant eventually cancels the apartment. In contrast, the unprotected group's process variants generally have fewer rent payment steps before the tenant cancels.
4. Variety of process variants: The protected group has a larger variety of process variants compared to the unprotected group, indicating that there might be a more diverse set of circumstances or requirements for the protected group during the application and tenancy process.
5. Performance times: Generally, the performance times for the protected group's process variants are higher than those of the unprotected group. This suggests that the application and tenancy process might be more time-consuming for the protected group.

It is important to note that these observations are based on the provided data and may not fully represent the entire application and tenancy process for both groups. Further investigation and domain knowledge would be required to determine the root causes of these differences and whether they are indicative of unfair treatment.
