Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to identify which cases in the event log deviate from the normative process described. First, I'll make sure I understand the normative process correctly.

The normative process says that every case starts with "Receive order". Then, the next step must be "Check inventory". After checking inventory, there are two possible paths:
1. If inventory is sufficient: Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
2. If inventory is insufficient: Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.

Key constraints from the description:
- "Authorize payment" must come after "Check inventory" and before "Package items".
- "Package items" must come after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order".
- "Ship order" must come after "Package items" and should never occur after "Cancel order".
- "Close order" must be the final activity in all cases.

Now, let's look at each case one by one.

Case 1:
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Authorize payment
- Package items
- Ship order
- Close order

This looks perfect. It follows the path for sufficient inventory. No violations here.

Case 2:
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Package items
- Authorize payment
- Ship order
- Close order

Here, "Package items" happens before "Authorize payment". According to the normative description, payment should be authorized before packaging. So this is a violation. The description says "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging".

Case 3:
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Authorize payment
- Cancel order
- Ship order
- Close order

This is problematic. After "Cancel order", they tried to "Ship order". The description says that after cancellation, you should go directly to "Close order" and not do any fulfillment activities like shipping. Also, "Authorize payment" happened before cancellation, which might be okay if they checked inventory and found it insufficient, but then why authorize payment? The description says that if inventory is insufficient, you should cancel directly after checking inventory, without authorizing payment. So authorizing payment before cancellation is also a violation.

Case 4:
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Cancel order
- Close order

This follows the insufficient inventory path perfectly. No violations here.

Case 5:
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Authorize payment
- Ship order
- Close order

Here, "Package items" is missing. The sequence goes from "Authorize payment" directly to "Ship order". According to the description, items must be packaged before shipping. So this is a violation.

Let me summarize the violations:

Case 2: Package items before Authorize payment.
Case 3: Authorize payment before Cancel order (which shouldn't happen if inventory is insufficient), and Ship order after Cancel order.
Case 5: Missing Package items step before Ship order.

Now, let me explain each violation with references to the normative description.

For Case 2: The normative description states that "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging". Here, packaging happened before authorization.

For Case 3: The description says that if inventory is insufficient, after checking inventory, you should go directly to Cancel order. Authorizing payment shouldn't happen in this path. Also, after cancellation, you shouldn't have any fulfillment activities like shipping.

For Case 5: The description states that "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping". Here, shipping occurred without the packaging step.

I think that covers all the deviations. Cases 1 and 4 are fine.

To solve the problem, we need to identify which cases in the event log deviate from the normative process described. The normative process outlines a specific sequence of activities for handling orders based on inventory availability. Here is the analysis of each case:

1. **Case 1**: This case follows the normative process for sufficient inventory correctly.
2. **Case 2**: This case violates the normative process because "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment". According to the normative description, "Authorize payment" should occur before "Package items".
3. **Case 3**: This case violates the normative process in two ways: "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order", which should not happen if inventory is insufficient, and "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order", which is not allowed.
4. **Case 4**: This case follows the normative process for insufficient inventory correctly.
5. **Case 5**: This case violates the normative process because "Package items" is missing before "Ship order". According to the normative description, "Package items" should occur before "Ship order".

Thus, the cases that violate the normative process are Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5.

|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2       | "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." The normative process requires payment authorization to happen after inventory is confirmed and before packaging begins.                                                                                                                          |
| 3       | "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order," which is illogical if inventory was insufficient. Additionally, "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which violates the rule that cancellation should be finalized directly without proceeding to fulfillment steps.                          |
| 5       | "Ship order" occurs without the preceding "Package items" step. The normative process requires items to be packaged before they can be shipped.                                                                                                                                                        |
```

The cases that violate the normative process are Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5.
