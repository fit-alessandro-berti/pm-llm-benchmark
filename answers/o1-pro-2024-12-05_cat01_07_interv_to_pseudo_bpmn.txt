**Textual BPMN-Like Process Description**

**Pool:** Organization

**Participants (Lanes):**  
- **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk (Mary)**  
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**  
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**

**Start Event:**  
- **Invoice Arrives** *(Input: Supplier’s invoice, usually via email)*

**AP Clerk Lane:**  
1. **Check for Valid PO:**  
   - Activity: *"Check Invoice for Purchase Order (PO) Number"*  
   - Gateway (Exclusive): Is a valid PO number present?  
     - **Yes** → Proceed to **Log Invoice**  
     - **No** → **Send Back to Supplier for PO Details**; then wait for updated invoice or additional info.
   
2. **Log Invoice:**  
   - Activity: *"Enter Invoice into Accounting System"*

3. **Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Confirmation:**  
   - Activity: *"Forward Invoice and PO Details to Purchasing"*  
   - Trigger: Completed logging of a valid PO invoice.
   
---

**Purchasing Officer Lane:**  
4. **Confirm Receipt and Accuracy:**  
   - Activity: *"Review Invoice Against PO"* (Compare quantities, prices, delivery charges)  
   - Gateway (Exclusive): Does the invoice match the PO?  
     - **Match** (Everything correct): *"Send Confirmation Email to AP"*  
     - **Discrepancy**:  
       - **Minor Discrepancy** (e.g., unclear pricing, missing info): Contact Supplier via AP or request AP Clerk to hold invoice. Possibly involve **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** for quick resolution.  
       - If discrepancy not resolved easily: Escalate to **AP Supervisor (Rita)**.
   
   *(Note: If no PO number or missing PO references were discovered at this stage, Purchasing instructs AP Clerk to obtain missing PO data before confirmation.)*

---

**AP Supervisor Lane (Exception Handling):**  
5. **Resolve Major Discrepancies:**  
   - Activity: *"Coordinate with Supplier, Purchasing, and Department Heads to Resolve Missing PO or Pricing Issues"*  
   - If no PO exists (e.g., informal services): AP Supervisor may arrange a retrospective PO or decide to reject the invoice.  
   - Once resolved, **Notify AP Clerk** that invoice is cleared to proceed.
   
---

**Supplier Relationship Manager Lane (Exception Resolution Support):**  
- **Assist in Supplier Communication:**  
  - Activity (as needed): *"Contact Supplier to Provide Missing PO or Corrected Pricing"*  
  - Inform AP or Purchasing once corrected invoice or information is available.

---

**Back to AP Clerk Lane (Post Confirmation):**  
6. **Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System:**  
   - Activity: *"Perform Line-Item Match"*  
   - Gateway (Exclusive): Is the invoice fully matched?  
     - **Yes**: Proceed to Manager Approval step.  
     - **No (Discrepancy)**: *"Email Purchasing for Clarification"*  
       - If still unresolved, escalate to AP Supervisor as per previous steps. After resolution, return here and proceed to Manager Approval.

7. **Request Manager Approval:**  
   - Activity: *"System Generates Automatic Approval Request to Manager"*

---

**Department Manager Lane:**  
8. **Manager Approval:**  
   - Activity: *"Review and Approve/Reject Invoice"*  
   - Gateway (Exclusive):  
     - **Approve**: Invoice returns to AP for payment scheduling.  
     - **Reject**: Manager requests AP to hold or investigate further. If rejected, AP Clerk may need to re-check or escalate again.
   
   *(Note: Rarely, the manager may reject due to suspicious discrepancies. In such cases, the process loops back to AP Clerk and possibly through the Supervisor for resolution.)*

---

**AP Clerk Lane (After Approval):**  
9. **Schedule for Payment:**  
   - Activity: *"Add Approved Invoice to Payment Cycle"*  
   - Output: Invoice included in the next payment run.

---

**End Event:**  
- **Invoice Ready for Payment**  
- The process ends with the invoice scheduled for payment, concluding the standard approval flow.

---

**Artifacts/Data Objects:**  
- **Invoice Document (Input)**
- **Purchase Order (PO)** (Reference data)  
- **Accounting System Records** (Data object)  
- **Confirmation Email from Purchasing** (Data object)  
- **Manager Approval Record** (Data object)  
- **Payment Schedule** (Output data object)

---

**Exceptions/Variations:**  
- If no PO is initially present, invoice is returned to Supplier for clarification.  
- If invoice-PO match fails, AP Clerk and Purchasing attempt resolution.  
- Persistent discrepancies involve AP Supervisor (Rita) and possibly Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) or Department Heads to either create a retrospective PO or reject the invoice.  
- Manager may reject invoice at the final approval stage, causing a loop back to AP Clerk and possibly re-involving Supervisor for resolution.
