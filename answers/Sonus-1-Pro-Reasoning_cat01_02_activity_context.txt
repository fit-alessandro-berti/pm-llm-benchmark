Justification
Verify Documents (Initial) and Verify Documents (Final) in C001:

The first verification was incomplete, leading to a request for additional documents. The second verification occurs after the additional documents are submitted.
Call Customer (Request Missing Docs) in C001:

This call is specifically to request missing documents, as indicated in the additional context.
Submit Additional Documents in C001:

Clarifies that the customer is submitting additional documents, specifically the ID scan.
Verify Documents (Identity) in C002:

Specifying "Identity" indicates the type of verification being performed.
Call Customer (Clarify Discrepancy) and Call Customer (Confirm Adjustments) in C002:

These names reflect the purposes of the two different calls in this case.
Adjust Account Details in C002 and C003:

A more specific name for the activity of adjusting account details internally.
Call Customer (Retrieve Customer) in C003:

Reflects the purpose of calling the customer to have them return to the branch.
Verify Documents (Initial Physical) and Verify Documents (Post-Adjustment) in C003:

Distinguishes between the initial physical verification and the re-verification after account adjustments.
By renaming the activities based on their contextual meanings, we achieve a clearer understanding of the process flow and the specific roles each activity plays in resolving the customer support tickets.
