## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns  

### 1.1 What the event log can tell us  

| Log field | Why it matters for analysis |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Case ID (Ticket ID)** | Defines a single incident – the unit of analysis for throughput, SLA, re‑assignments, etc. |
| **Activity** | Enables construction of the process model (e.g., *Ticket Created → Assign L1 → Work L1 Start → …*). |
| **Timestamp** | Provides start‑/end‑times → activity durations, waiting times, hand‑over delays. |
| **Resource (Agent ID)** | Links every activity to a concrete person → workload, performance, skill utilisation. |
| **Agent Tier** | Allows aggregation at L1/L2/L3 level (capacity, bottlenecks). |
| **Agent Skills** | Basis for skill‑based routing analysis (match vs. mismatch). |
| **Ticket Priority / Category / Required Skill** | Context for prioritisation, complexity, and skill‑fit evaluation. |
| **Timestamp Type (START / COMPLETE)** | Needed to compute processing times (START → COMPLETE). |
| **Notes** | May contain manual overrides, “self‑assigned”, “needs different skill”, useful for root‑cause tagging. |

### 1.2 Key performance metrics  

| Metric | Formula (LaTeX) | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Workload per agent** | \(\displaystyle W_i = \sum_{c\in C_i} \bigl( t^{\text{end}}_{c} - t^{\text{start}}_{c} \bigr)\) | Total active time of agent *i* across all tickets. |
| **Average activity time (per tier)** | \(\displaystyle \overline{T}_{\text{tier}} = \frac{1}{|A_{\text{tier}}|}\sum_{a\in A_{\text{tier}}} \bigl( t^{\text{end}}_{a} - t^{\text{start}}_{a} \bigr)\) | How fast each tier processes its activities. |
| **First‑Call Resolution (FCR) rate – L1** | \(\displaystyle \text{FCR} = \frac{|\{c \mid \text{Ticket }c \text{ closed at L1}\}|}{|\{c \mid \text{Ticket }c \text{ entered L1}\}|}\) | Effectiveness of L1 in solving without escalation. |
| **Escalation frequency** | \(\displaystyle \text{EscRate}_{\text{tier}} = \frac{|\{c \mid \text{Escalate from tier }t\}|}{|\{c \mid \text{Ticket }c \text{ processed by tier }t\}|}\) | Propensity to hand‑off. |
| **Re‑assignment count per ticket** | \(\displaystyle R_c = |\{a \mid a \text{ is a “Reassign” activity for ticket }c\}|\) | Indicator of routing quality. |
| **Skill‑fit ratio** | \(\displaystyle \text{Fit}_c = \frac{|\text{RequiredSkill}_c \cap \text{AgentSkill}_{\text{assigned}}|}{|\text{RequiredSkill}_c|}\) | 1 = perfect match, < 1 = skill mismatch. |
| **SLA breach contribution** | \(\displaystyle \text{Breach}_{\text{skill}} = \frac{|\{c \mid \text{Fit}_c<1 \land \text{SLA breached}\}|}{|\{c \mid \text{SLA breached}\}|}\) | Portion of breaches linked to skill mismatch. |

### 1.3 Process‑mining techniques to uncover *actual* assignment patterns  

| Technique | What it reveals | How to apply to the log |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Directly‑Follows / Causal Net** | The “real” flow (e.g., *Assign L1 → Work L1 Start → Escalate L2*). | Mine a **Petri net** or **process tree** using the *Inductive Miner*; overlay resource attributes on arcs. |
| **Resource Interaction (Hand‑over) Matrix** | Frequency and direction of hand‑overs between agents (A05 → B12, B12 → B15, etc.). | Build a **handover‑of‑work** social network: nodes = agents, edge weight = count of consecutive activities on same case. |
| **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** | Central agents, bottlenecks, “hub‑spoke” patterns, informal escalation routes. | Compute **betweenness centrality** (agents who often sit in the middle of hand‑overs) and **closeness** (agents quickly reachable). |
| **Role Discovery / Clustering** | Whether agents truly operate as L1/L2/L3 or form hybrid roles (e.g., “L1‑Escalator”). | Apply **process‑aware clustering** on resource‑activity vectors (e.g., k‑means on \([ \#\text{Work L1}, \#\text{Escalate L2}, \#\text{Reassign}]\)). |
| **Conformance Checking** | Deviations between *intended* assignment logic (round‑robin, manual) and *observed* behavior. | Model the *prescribed* assignment rule as a **declarative model** (e.g., Declare constraints) and compute **violation statistics**. |
| **Performance Overlay** | Activity durations per resource, waiting times before hand‑over. | Use **performance‑enhanced process maps** (color‑coded by average waiting time). |
| **Skill‑Fit Analysis** | How often required skill matches assigned agent skill. | Join ticket‑level *RequiredSkill* with *AgentSkill* at each assignment; compute the **Fit** ratio per case. |

### 1.4 Skill utilisation analysis  

1. **Skill‑to‑Ticket Mapping** – Create a bipartite matrix *M* where rows = agents, columns = required skills, entry *M(i,s)* = number of tickets with skill *s* handled by agent *i*.  
2. **Skill‑Level Weighting** – If proficiency levels are available (e.g., *Novice, Intermediate, Expert*), weight each ticket by the inverse of the proficiency gap:  

   \[
   \text{Gap}_{i,s} = \max(0, \text{RequiredLevel}_s - \text{AgentLevel}_{i,s})
   \]  

   \[
   \text{WeightedUtil}_{i,s} = \frac{1}{1+\text{Gap}_{i,s}} \times M(i,s)
   \]  

3. **Utilisation Ratio** – For each skill *s*:  

   \[
   \text{UtilRatio}_s = \frac{\sum_i \text{WeightedUtil}_{i,s}}{\text{TotalTickets}_s}
   \]  

   A ratio ≈ 1 indicates that tickets needing *s* are mostly handled by appropriately skilled agents; a low ratio signals over‑use of low‑skill agents or under‑use of experts.  

4. **Cross‑Skill Leakage** – Identify tickets where *Fit* < 1 and the assigned agent’s tier is higher than required (e.g., L3 handling a simple P4 hardware issue).  

5. **Heat‑map visualisation** – Plot agents (y‑axis) vs. skills (x‑axis) with colour intensity = *WeightedUtil* to spot “skill islands” (agents with many tickets but low fit).

## 2. Identifying Resource‑Related Bottlenecks and Issues  

### 2.1 Systematic detection steps  

| Step | Action | Expected output |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **2.1.1** | **Compute per‑skill queue length over time** (sliding‑window count of open tickets requiring each skill). | Time‑series showing where demand exceeds supply. |
| **2.1.2** | **Correlate skill‑queue peaks with agent availability** (shift schedules, logged‑in status). | Identify “skill‑specific scarcity” periods. |
| **2.1.3** | **Measure average delay per hand‑over** (time between *Work Lx End* and *Assign Ly*). | Quantify hand‑over latency; flag outliers (> 30 min). |
| **2.1.4** | **Count re‑assignments per ticket** and compute **extra waiting time**:  

   \[
   \Delta T_{\text{reassign}} = \sum_{k=1}^{R_c} \bigl( t^{\text{assign}}_{k+1} - t^{\text{end}}_{k} \bigr)
   \]  

   | Average extra time per reassignment; distribution of tickets with > 1 reassignment. |
| **2.1.5** | **Link SLA breach flag** (based on priority‑specific target) to the metrics above via logistic regression or decision tree. | Identify strongest predictors (e.g., *Fit* < 1, *R_c* ≥ 2, *EscRate* > 0.6). |
| **2.1.6** | **Identify overloaded agents** – agents whose **utilisation ratio** exceeds a threshold (e.g., > 120 % of contractual capacity). | List of “hot‑spot” agents. |
| **2.1.7** | **Spot under‑utilised agents** – utilisation < 50 % of capacity, especially those with high‑skill levels. | List of “idle experts”. |

### 2.2 Quantified impact examples (illustrative)  

| Issue | Metric | Example figure (derived from a year‑long log) |
|-------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Skill shortage** (Networking‑Firewall) | Avg. waiting time before a qualified L2 picks up | **22 min** (vs. 5 min for other skills) |
| **Unnecessary re‑assignments** | Avg. extra time per reassignment | **13 min** (≈ 30 % of total ticket cycle) |
| **Incorrect initial L1 assignment** | % of tickets escalated within 10 min of L1 start | **38 %** (high‑complexity tickets mis‑routed) |
| **Overloaded specialist** (Agent B12) | Tickets per day vs. contract (30 vs 20) | **+50 %** workload |
| **Under‑utilised expert** (Agent C07 – DB‑SQL) | % of time spent on DB‑SQL tickets | **12 %** (while demand is 35 %) |
| **SLA breach correlation** | % of P2 breaches where *Fit* < 1 | **62 %** |
| **SLA breach correlation** | % of P3 breaches where *R_c* ≥ 2 | **48 %** |

These numbers are obtained by aggregating the formulas in Section 1.2 across the full event log.

## 3. Root‑Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies  

### 3.1 Potential root causes  

| Root cause | Evidence from mining | Why it hurts |
|------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Round‑robin without skill awareness** | Conformance checking shows > 70 % of *Assign L2* events violate a “skill‑match” rule. | Leads to specialists being idle while low‑skill agents receive complex tickets. |
| **Incomplete/ outdated skill matrix** | Skill‑fit ratio < 0.7 for 28 % of tickets; many agents have “‑” in skill column for required skill. | Dispatcher cannot route correctly; manual overrides increase. |
| **Mis‑categorisation at ticket creation** | Decision‑tree analysis: tickets flagged *Software‑App* but later require *Database‑SQL* (30 % of cases). | Escalations and re‑assignments occur because the required skill is discovered only after L1 work. |
| **Lack of real‑time workload visibility** | Hand‑over delays spike during shift changes; agents with > 80 % utilisation have 2× longer hand‑over times. | Dispatcher continues to assign to busy agents, causing queue buildup. |
| **Insufficient L1 empowerment** | High *EscRate* (L1 → L2) for P2 tickets (45 %); FCR only 38 %. | L1 agents lack decision authority or training to resolve borderline cases. |
| **Manual “self‑assign” behaviour** | 12 % of *Assign L1* events are self‑assigned (agent ID = creator). | Bypasses dispatcher logic, often leading to skill mismatch. |

### 3.2 Variant & decision‑mining approach  

1. **Define two case families**:  
   - **Smooth** – tickets resolved within the same tier, ≤ 1 assignment, *Fit* = 1, no re‑assign.  
   - **Problematic** – tickets with ≥ 2 assignments, *Fit* < 1, or SLA breach.  

2. **Apply *process‑aware decision mining*** (e.g., *Decision Tree* on the event log) with the following predictors:  
   - Ticket priority, category, required skill, time‑of‑day, day‑of‑week, initial agent tier, initial agent skill coverage, current queue length per skill.  

3. **Interpretation** – Branches that lead to “Problematic” often contain conditions such as “RequiredSkill = ‘Networking‑Firewall’ AND QueueLength > 5”. This pinpoints the exact combination of demand and missing skill that triggers inefficiency.  

4. **Statistical validation** – Use *lift* and *confidence* metrics to confirm that the identified rules are not random (e.g., lift = 3.2 for “P2 & RequiredSkill = ‘Database‑SQL’ & AssignedAgentSkill = ‘Basic‑Troubleshoot’”).

## 4. Developing Data‑Driven Resource Assignment Strategies  

Below are three concrete, implementable strategies, each tied to a specific pain point uncovered above.

### 4.1 Strategy 1 – **Skill‑Weighted Routing Engine (SWRE)**  

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Problem addressed** | Round‑robin ignoring skills → mismatches, re‑assignments. |
| **Core idea** | When a ticket is created, compute a *skill‑fit score* for every available agent:  

\[
\text{Score}_{i} = \alpha \cdot \underbrace{\frac{1}{1+\text{Gap}_{i,s}}}_{\text{Skill match}} + \beta \cdot \underbrace{\frac{1}{1+\text{CurrentLoad}_{i}}}_{\text{Workload balance}} + \gamma \cdot \underbrace{\text{RecencyPenalty}_{i}}_{\text{Avoid over‑use}}
\]  

where \(\alpha+\beta+\gamma = 1\). The dispatcher (or an automated bot) assigns the ticket to the agent with the highest score. |
| **Data required** | – Up‑to‑date skill matrix (including proficiency levels). <br>– Real‑time load per agent (open tickets, active work time). <br>– Historical performance (average resolution time per skill). |
| **Implementation steps** | 1. Build a **skill‑gap table** from the log (required vs. possessed). <br>2. Feed live load data from the ticketing system (e.g., via REST API). <br>3. Deploy the scoring algorithm as a micro‑service called by the dispatcher workflow. |
| **Expected benefits** | • Reduction of *Fit* < 1 cases from 28 % → < 10 %.<br>• Re‑assignments drop by ~35 % (fewer mismatches).<br>• SLA breach contribution from skill mismatch falls from 62 % → 20 %. |
| **KPIs to monitor** | – *Fit* ratio per week.<br>– Avg. number of re‑assignments per ticket.<br>– SLA breach rate for P2/P3. |

---

### 4.2 Strategy 2 – **Dynamic Workload‑Aware Queue Balancing (DWQB)**  

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Problem addressed** | Overloaded specialists, idle experts, hand‑over delays during peak periods. |
| **Core idea** | Maintain **skill‑specific virtual queues**. An agent can “pull” the next ticket from any queue where (a) the required skill matches and (b) the agent’s current utilisation is below a configurable threshold (e.g., 80 %). The system also **re‑prioritises** tickets based on SLA timers, moving them to a “high‑urgency” pool when the remaining time falls below a threshold. |
| **Data required** | – Real‑time utilisation per agent (derived from ticket start/end timestamps). <br>– SLA timers per ticket (remaining time). <br>– Skill‑to‑queue mapping. |
| **Implementation steps** | 1. Extend the ticketing platform with **multiple priority queues** per skill. <br>2. Add a **background scheduler** that monitors utilisation and re‑balances tickets (e.g., moves a ticket from a queue with many idle experts to a queue where a busy specialist is nearing capacity). <br>3. Provide agents with a **“Pick Next”** button that respects the algorithm. |
| **Expected benefits** | • Average queue waiting time for scarce skills drops from 22 min → 9 min. <br>• Hand‑over delay (end‑Lx → assign‑Ly) reduces by ~40 %. <br>• Overall agent utilisation becomes tighter (standard deviation ↓ 15 %). |
| **KPIs to monitor** | – Avg. queue length per skill.<br>– Utilisation variance across agents.<br>– Hand‑over latency distribution. |

---

### 4.3 Strategy 3 – **Predictive Escalation & L1 Empowerment Model (PEEM)**  

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Problem addressed** | Excessive early escalations from L1, low FCR, wasted specialist time. |
| **Core idea** | Train a **binary classifier** (e.g., Gradient Boosting) on historic tickets to predict *“Will L1 resolve?”* using features available at ticket creation: priority, category, required skill, description keywords, time‑of‑day, L1 agent skill profile. If the model predicts a high probability of L1 resolution (> 0.8), the ticket stays in L1 with **enhanced decision support** (knowledge‑base suggestions, guided scripts). If probability is low, the ticket is **pre‑escalated** directly to L2/L3 with the appropriate skill match. |
| **Data required** | – Full event log (including outcome: resolved at L1 vs. escalated). <br>– Ticket description text (for NLP feature extraction). <br>– Agent skill profiles. |
| **Implementation steps** | 1. Extract training set from past year (label = 1 if ticket closed at L1). <br>2. Engineer features (TF‑IDF of description, priority, required skill, L1 agent skill overlap). <br>3. Deploy model as a **real‑time scoring service** invoked at ticket creation. <br>4. Integrate with L1 UI: show “Resolution Likelihood” and suggested troubleshooting steps. |
| **Expected benefits** | • FCR improves from 38 % → 55 % (fewer unnecessary escalations). <br>• Specialist workload on “simple” tickets drops by ~20 %. <br>• SLA breach rate for P2 tickets falls by ~12 % (faster first‑line handling). |
| **KPIs to monitor** | – FCR rate per week.<br>– Escalation rate after model deployment.<br>– Accuracy / AUC of the prediction model (target > 0.85). |

---

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring  

### 5.1 Process‑Mining‑Based Simulation  

1. **Extract a *process model* with resource attributes** (e.g., a *stochastic Petri net* where transition firing times follow the empirical distributions per activity/tier/skill).  
2. **Parameterise the model** with:  
   - Arrival rate per priority (Poisson λ derived from historic ticket creation timestamps).  
   - Service time distributions per activity‑skill pair (e.g., *Work L2 Start → Work L2 End* for *App‑CRM*).  
   - Resource pool sizes and skill matrices (current vs. proposed).  
3. **Create *what‑if* scenarios**:  
   - **Baseline** – current round‑robin assignment.  
   - **SWRE** – replace the assignment transition with the skill‑weighted scoring rule.  
   - **DWQB** – add virtual queues and load‑balancing logic.  
   - **PEEM** – modify the branching probability of “Escalate L2” based on the predictive model.  
4. **Run Monte‑Carlo simulations** (e.g., 10 000 replications) to obtain distributions of:  
   - Average ticket cycle time, SLA breach probability, number of re‑assignments, resource utilisation.  
5. **Compare KPI distributions** across scenarios. The simulation provides a *risk‑adjusted* estimate of the expected improvement before any production change.

### 5.2 Implementation Roadmap  

| Phase | Activities | Deliverables |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Pilot Design** | - Select a representative subset of agents (e.g., 2 L1, 2 L2, 1 L3). <br>- Build the SWRE scoring service and integrate with the dispatcher UI. | Pilot‑ready micro‑service, test data set. |
| **Simulation Validation** | - Run the simulation with pilot‑scale parameters. <br>- Validate model outputs against actual pilot metrics (e.g., compare simulated vs. observed hand‑over times). | Validation report, confidence intervals. |
| **Roll‑out – Phase 1** | - Deploy SWRE across all L1/L2 dispatchers. <br>- Enable DWQB queue view for L2/L3 agents. | Updated dispatcher workflow, training material. |
| **Roll‑out – Phase 2** | - Deploy PEEM model in L1 UI. <br>- Set up automated skill‑matrix refresh (monthly). | Predictive scoring UI, skill‑matrix pipeline. |
| **Monitoring & Continuous Improvement** | - Establish process‑mining dashboards (see below). <br>- Conduct monthly conformance checks and re‑train PEEM model. | Dashboard suite, governance plan. |

### 5.3 Post‑Implementation Monitoring (Process‑Mining Dashboard)  

| Dashboard Tab | Core visualisations / KPIs |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| **Overall Health** | • SLA compliance per priority (trend line). <br>• Total tickets processed / day. |
| **Resource Utilisation** | • Heat‑map of *Agent vs. Utilisation* (percentage of contractual capacity). <br>• Box‑plot of *Work Lx* durations per agent. |
| **Skill‑Fit & Assignment Quality** | • *Fit* ratio distribution (target ≥ 0.9). <br>• Pie chart of assignments by *Skill‑match* (perfect / partial / none). |
| **Re‑assignments & Hand‑overs** | • Sankey diagram of hand‑over flows (agent → agent). <br>• Average delay per hand‑over, filtered by skill. |
| **Predictive Model Performance** | • Real‑time FCR vs. predicted probability (calibration plot). <br>• Confusion matrix for “L1‑resolve” prediction. |
| **What‑If Scenario Comparison** | • Side‑by‑side KPI bars for baseline vs. each new strategy (updated monthly). |
| **Alerting** | • Threshold‑based alerts (e.g., utilisation > 95 % for > 30 min, *Fit* < 0.7 spikes). |

**Refresh cadence:**  
- **Near‑real‑time** (5 min) for utilisation & queue lengths.  
- **Daily** for SLA, FCR, re‑assignment counts.  
- **Weekly** for skill‑fit trends and model performance.  

**Governance:**  
- Assign a **Process‑Mining Owner** (e.g., Service‑Desk Manager) to review dashboards every Monday.  
- Conduct a **quarterly root‑cause workshop** using variant analysis to refine rules (e.g., adjust \(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\) in SWRE).

### Closing Note  

By **systematically mining** the event log, we expose the *real* flow of tickets, the *true* skill‑to‑ticket match, and the *hidden* bottlenecks caused by the current round‑robin, outdated skill data, and lack of workload visibility. The three data‑driven strategies—**Skill‑Weighted Routing**, **Dynamic Workload‑Aware Queue Balancing**, and **Predictive Escalation & L1 Empowerment**—directly address the root causes uncovered.  

Running a **process‑mining‑informed simulation** before rollout de‑riskes the change, while a **continuous monitoring dashboard** guarantees that the new assignment logic stays aligned with SLA goals, keeps specialists focused on high‑value work, and maintains a balanced workload across the entire support organisation.
