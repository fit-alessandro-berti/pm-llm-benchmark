Process enhancement is a concept in process mining that focuses on improving or optimizing an existing business process. It involves analyzing event logs from a process execution system to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, deviations, and potential areas of improvement. The goal is to make the process more efficient, effective, and compliant with organizational objectives and regulations.

Process discovery, on the other hand, is the technique of automatically constructing a process model based on event logs. It aims to provide a visual representation of how a process is actually executed, without any prior knowledge or assumptions about the process. The resulting model can be used for process understanding, documentation, and analysis.

Conformance checking is the technique of comparing an executed process with a predefined process model to identify deviations and non-conformances. It helps organizations to ensure that their processes are being executed as intended and to identify areas where improvements can be made to increase compliance.

The main difference between process enhancement, process discovery, and conformance checking is their focus and objectives. Process enhancement focuses on improving an existing process, while process discovery focuses on constructing a process model from event logs. Conformance checking, on the other hand, focuses on evaluating the compliance of an executed process with a predefined process model. All three techniques are important components of process mining and can be used together to achieve process improvement goals.
