Key differences between the two logs

1. LocalResident  
   • Group A: always FALSE  
   • Group B: always TRUE  

2. CommunityGroup  
   • Group A: always “None”  
   • Group B: sometimes “Highland Civic Darts Club”  

3. ScoreAdjustment  
   • Group A: always 0  
   • Group B:   
     – 0 when CommunityGroup = None  
     – +10 “Community Boost” when CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club  

4. Outcomes  
   • Group A: 2 approved (P001, P003), 1 rejected (P002)  
   • Group B: 2 approved (U001, U003), 1 rejected (U002)  

Where the bias sits

A. Direct, explicit bias in the scoring rule  
The “Community Boost” ( +10 ) is granted only when  
LocalResident = TRUE  and  CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club”.  
Protected-group applicants never satisfy those conditions, so their scores are never adjusted upward.  
This is disparate treatment: decision logic uses a feature that is only available to the unprotected group.

B. How the bias alters decisions  
1. U003 shows why the boost matters:  
   • Raw score = 695 (below the implicit 700 approval threshold).  
   • Boosted score = 705  application approved.  
   • An identical protected-group applicant with 695 would still have 695 (no boost) and would be rejected.

2. Conditional comparison at the same raw score  
   • At 710: both groups are rejected (P002, U002) – no gap.  
   • At 720: both groups are approved (P001, U001) – no gap.  
   • Below 700: only the unprotected group can be pushed above the line, producing a gap that is hidden if we look only at overall approval rates.

C. Proxy discrimination through LocalResident and CommunityGroup  
Membership in a specific local club functions as a socio-demographic proxy. Because all unprotected applicants are locals and some belong to the club, they can benefit from the rule, whereas all protected applicants are non-locals and receive no benefit.

Why this constitutes systematic bias

• Different treatment is written directly into the ScoreAdjustment logic, not caused by random noise.  
• The rule violates conditional fairness metrics (equalized odds / conditional demographic parity): for the same preliminary score the protected group has a lower probability of approval.  
• Even though overall approval rates are the same (2 of 3 in each group), the process still disadvantages protected applicants at the margin, masking the bias behind aggregate parity.

Summary

The log for Group B (unprotected) reveals a biased rule: “+10 Community Boost” tied to LocalResident = TRUE and a specific CommunityGroup. This boost never appears in the Group A log, giving the unprotected group a systematic advantage in crossing the decision threshold. The bias manifests as disparate treatment and conditional outcome disparities even when preliminary creditworthiness is identical.
