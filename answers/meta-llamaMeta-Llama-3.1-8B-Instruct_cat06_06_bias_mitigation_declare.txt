Here is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints to mitigate bias:
```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 0.0, "confidence": 0.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Approve": {"support": 0.0, "confidence": 0.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Approve": {"support": 0.0, "confidence": 0.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

Here is a brief explanation of each added constraint:

1.  **Coexistence Constraint:** This constraint enforces that for sensitive applicants (e.g., minority groups), a `ManualReview` activity must coexist in the process to ensure fairness and scrutiny. This helps prevent biased decisions based on demographic factors.

2.  **Response or Succession Constraints:** We added constraints to ensure that decision steps are not directly preceded by activities disclosing sensitive attributes without first performing a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This prevents immediate biased outcomes by introducing a fairness check before making decisions.

3.  **Non-succession Constraints:** We introduced constraints to prevent a direct succession from sensitive attribute events to decision events. For example, we set the support and confidence to 0 for a direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject`. This prevents the system from immediately making biased decisions based on sensitive attributes.

These constraints work together to limit the process's bias and ensure fairness in the loan application process.
