To group the events into separate cases, we need to analyze the sequence of activities, timing, and patient attributes. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis:

### Case 1: Patient Age 45, Male

**Events:**

1. **Register patient** - ER, Age 45, Male
2. **Initial triage** - ER, Age 45, Male, Triage Code 3
3. **X-ray imaging** - Radiology, Age 45, Male, Body Part: Left Leg
4. **Doctor consultation** - ER, Age 45, Male, Diagnosis: Hairline Fracture
5. **Patient discharged** - ER, Age 45, Male, Followup: Outpatient Clinic

**Grouping Reason:**
- The sequence starts with registration and follows with triage, diagnostic tests (X-ray), consultation, and discharge all related to the same patient (Age 45, Male).

### Case 2: Patient Age 62, Female

**Events:**

1. **Register patient** - ER, Age 62, Female
2. **Lab test requested** - ER, Age 62, Female, Test Type: Blood Panel
3. **Lab test completed** - Laboratory, Age 62, Female, Results: Normal Levels
4. **Doctor consultation** - ER, Age 62, Female, Diagnosis: Minor Infection
5. **Prescription created** - ER, Age 62, Female, Medication: Antibiotics
6. **Patient discharged** - ER, Age 62, Female, Followup: Pharmacy Pickup

**Grouping Reason:**
- The sequence starts with registration and follows with lab test requests/results, consultation, prescription, and discharge all related to the same patient (Age 62, Female).

### Case 3: Patient Age 28, Male

**Events:**

1. **Register patient** - Surgery, Age 28, Male
2. **Doctor consultation** - Surgery, Age 28, Male, Reason: Scheduled Knee Surgery
3. **Surgery preparation** - Surgery, Age 28, Male, Prep Type: General Anesthesia
4. **Surgery performed** - Surgery, Age 28, Male, Procedure: Arthroscopy
5. **Recovery room** - Surgery, Age 28, Male, Condition: Stable
6. **Patient discharged** - Surgery, Age 28, Male, Followup: Physiotherapy Sessions

**Grouping Reason:**
- The sequence starts with registration and follows with scheduled consultation, preparation for surgery, surgery itself, recovery room stay, and discharge all related to the same patient (Age 28, Male).

### Final Case Groupings:

1. **Case 1: Age 45, Male** - Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
2. **Case 2: Age 62, Female** - Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
3. **Case 3: Age 28, Male** - Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

Each case is logically grouped based on the consistent patient attributes (age and gender) and the sequential nature of the activities (from registration to discharge).
