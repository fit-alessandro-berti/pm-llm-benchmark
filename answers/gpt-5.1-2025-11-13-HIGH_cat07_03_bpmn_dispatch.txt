The image is a BPMN process diagram that models how a computerhardware shop dispatches goods, using two swimlanes: **Logistics** (top) and **Warehouse** (bottom).

**Overall flow**

1. **Start – “Ship goods”**  
   A start event triggers the process and immediately splits at a **parallel gateway** so that logistics arrangements and physical packaging can proceed in parallel.

2. **Clarify shipment method**  
   The secretary reviews the **order details** to determine how the goods should be shipped.

3. **Decision: “Special handling?”**  
   - **No special handling:**
     - **Check if insurance is required** using **customer information**.  
     - A gateway then:
       - Always leads to **Write package label**.  
       - Additionally, **if insurance is necessary**, triggers **Insure parcel**.  
     - After labeling (and any insurance), the flow continues toward the final joining point.
   - **Special handling required:**
     - **Get 3 offers from logistic companies.**  
     - **Select logistic company and place order.**  
     - This path then merges with the “standard handling” path at an exclusive gateway (only one of these alternatives is taken).

### Warehouse lane (bottom)

4. **Package goods**  
   Physical packing occurs in parallel with the logistics work.

5. **Time constraint**  
   A **48hour timer** attached to “Package goods” leads to **Notify customer about delay** if packing is not completed in time. After notification, the process rejoins the main flow.

### Completion

6. A **parallel join gateway** waits for both:
   - Logistics preparations (labeling / special carrier booking), and  
   - Warehouse tasks (packaging and any delay notification).

7. Once joined:
   - **Fill out shipment paperwork.**  
   - **Move package to pickup area.**

8. **End event – “Shipment prepared”**  
   The shipment is ready for pickup, completing the process.
