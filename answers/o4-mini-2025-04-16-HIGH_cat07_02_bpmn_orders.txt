The diagram you’ve shown is a classic cross-functional BPMN (Business Process Model & Notation) chart of an “order-to-cash” process, laid out in four swimlanes (Sales, Production, Procurement, Warehouse). Here’s how it flows:

1. Sales lane  
   - A timer start event (“Monday morning”) kicks off the process.  
   - Task: “Check order for completeness.”  
   - Task: “Check if customer is already in the database.”  
   - Exclusive gateway:  
     • If customer  in database  Task “Add customer to the database”  rejoin.  
     • If customer  database  bypass add.  
   - Task: “Send order details.”  
     • This action emits two message flows (dashed arrows) carrying the order details to Production and to Procurement.  
   - Task: “Draft invoice.”  
   - End.

2. Production lane  
   - Intermediate message-catch event: “Order details arrive.”  
   - Task: “Plan production.”  
   - Gateway (parallel or event-based split):  
     • One branch waits for a “Material not faulty” message from Procurement (dashed message flow).  
     • The other branch proceeds to Task “Manufacture product.”  
   - These branches synchronize at a join gateway.  
   - Intermediate message throw event: “Product complete,” which sends a message to Warehouse (dashed).

3. Procurement lane  
   - Intermediate message-catch event: “Order details arrive.”  
   - Collapsed subprocess “Material Compensation”:  
     • Inside it you see a start event  Task “Order materials”  end.  
     • There’s also an embedded throw event “Return material” in case of defects.  
   - After the subprocess: Task “Check materials.”  
   - Exclusive gateway:  
     • If materials are faulty  end event “Order cancellation.”  
     • If materials are OK  intermediate message throw event “Material not faulty,” sent to Production.

4. Warehouse lane  
   - Intermediate message-catch event: “Product complete” (from Production).  
   - Task: “Send product” to the customer.  
   - Intermediate message throw event: “Product sent,” which sends a message back to Sales (dashed) that effectively ties into the invoicing step.

Key notational elements:  
• Solid arrows = sequence flow within a lane.  
• Dashed arrows = message flows between lanes (Sales  Prod/Proc, Proc  Prod, Prod  Warehouse, Warehouse  Sales).  
• Diamonds = gateways (exclusive or parallel) for decision-splits and synchronization.  
• Circles = start, end or intermediate events (timer, message catch/throw).  
• Rounded-corner rectangles = activities (tasks or subprocesses).  

Overall, it captures the end-to-end journey of a customer order: Sales validates and records the order, Procurement sources and checks materials, Production waits for material clearance then builds the product, Warehouse ships it, and finally Sales issues the invoice.
