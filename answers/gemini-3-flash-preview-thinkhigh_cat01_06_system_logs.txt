To transform this raw system log into a structured event log, I have focused on **Object-Centric Case Identification**. This means cases are defined by the specific document or task the user is interacting with, rather than just the application name or a single timeline.

### Logic and Explanation

#### 1. Case Identification (Grouping Strategy)
I used the **Window Title/Document Name** as the primary pivot for Case IDs. This is because users often multi-task; grouping by "Session" would result in a single, messy spaghetti model. By grouping by document:
*   **DOC-001:** Captures the lifecycle of a new document, including a "suspend" period where the user gathered information from Excel and Email.
*   **EMAIL-402:** Isolates the specific communication task.
*   **FIN-2024:** Tracks the specific financial update.
*   **QR-2024-Q4:** Captures the update to the official Quarterly Report. Note that the first event (08:59:50) was assigned here even though the user immediately switched away, as it represents the initial opening of that work context.

#### 2. Activity Naming (Abstraction)
Raw system events are too granular for process analysis. I mapped them to "Business Activities":
*   **FOCUS/SWITCH:** Transformed into "Open Document" (if first time) or ignored if it was just a navigation toggle.
*   **TYPING:** Standardized as "Edit Content" or specific domain actions like "Update Financial Data" depending on the application (Word vs. Excel).
*   **SCROLL/CLICK:** When occurring in a PDF, these are abstracted to "Review Document."
*   **SAVE/CLOSE:** Kept as explicit milestones (Save Document/Close Document) as these often represent the completion of a sub-process.

#### 3. Handling Transitions
The `SWITCH` events in the raw log were used as "context markers." They weren't given their own rows in the final log but were used to determine when one Case was paused and another was activated. For example, the switch at `09:06:00` signaled the resumption of Case `DOC-001` following the completion of the budget work in `FIN-2024`.

#### 4. Narrative of User Work
The log reveals a common "Information Worker" pattern:
1.  The user starts a high-level task (**Quarterly Report**) but realizes they need a new draft (**Document1**).
2.  While drafting, they check an **Email** for confirmation.
3.  They then **Review a PDF** (Key Findings) and **Update a Budget** in Excel to ensure accuracy.
4.  Finally, they return to **Document1** to insert the budget reference and then move that information into the **Quarterly Report** to finish the session.
