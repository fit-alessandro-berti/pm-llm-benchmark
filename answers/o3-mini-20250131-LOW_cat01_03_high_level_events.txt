Below is one way to transform the detailed event log into a set of five high-level process steps. The grouping is based on the logical sequence, temporal proximity, and similar functional activity across cases.

  
High-Level Process Steps:

1. Material Preparation  
• Low-Level Events Grouped:  
– Retrieve raw metal sheet  
– Scan barcode  
– Place metal sheet on table  
• Rationale:  
These events are all concerned with fetching and identifying the raw material, then making it available for further processing. The actions ensure that the correct material (via barcode) is selected and physically positioned for the next steps.

  
2. Component Setup  
• Low-Level Events Grouped:  
– Align metal sheet  
– Preheat metal sheet  
• Rationale:  
After placing the raw material, the process moves to preparation and conditioning of the workpiece. Aligning ensures proper orientation, and preheating conditions the material, making them part of a component setup phase to ready the material for joining (welding).

  
3. Assembly (Welding)  
• Low-Level Events Grouped:  
– Pick up welding tool  
– Weld corner A  
– Weld corner B  
• Rationale:  
These events represent the assembly phase where the conditioned metal is joined together. The actual welding—alongside the pick-up of a specific tool—signals a clear transition from preparation to physical construction of the component.

  
4. Quality Assurance  
• Low-Level Events Grouped:  
– Measure weld integrity  
– Visual check  
• Rationale:  
After assembly, the integrity and accuracy of the welds are verified with both sensor measurements and a final visual check. These events focus on ensuring that the weld quality meets process standards before moving to further steps.

  
5. Finishing  
• Low-Level Events Grouped:  
– Apply protective coating  
– Dry coating  
• Rationale:  
The final phase of the process involves enhancing the durability and performance of the product by applying a protective coating. Applying and drying the coating are clearly sequential finishing operations that complete the manufacturing cycle.

In Summary:

• The events grouped in the “Material Preparation” and “Component Setup” stages are preparatory actions that provide required inputs and conditions for the subsequent weld assembly.  
• “Assembly (Welding)” clearly reflects the mechanical joining phase.  
• “Quality Assurance” is dedicated to checking that the assembly meets standards through both measured and visual evaluations.  
• Finally, “Finishing” adds a layer of product enhancement by applying and curing a protective coating.  

This structured view abstracts the low-level actions into broader functions, making it easier for stakeholders to monitor, analyze, and optimize the manufacturing workflow.
