Here is the final process tree model based on the given event log and its observed behavior:

The process tree will consist of the following nodes:

1. Archive Case (AC)
2. Send Confirmation (SC)
3. Approval Decision (AD)
4. Receive Application (RA)
5. Validate Form (VF)
6. Assess Eligibility (AE)
7. Request Missing Info (RMI)
8. Loop (represents the optional repeating loop for missing information and re-validation)

The relationship between the nodes is as follows:

* Archive Case (AC) is the end node.
* Send Confirmation (SC) and Approval Decision (AD) are sibling nodes.
* Send Confirmation (SC) and Approval Decision (AD) have a parent node called 'Finalize Application'.
* Finalize Application is a child of the node 'Activities After Receive Application'.
* Receive Application (RA) is the parent of 'Activities After Receive Application'.
* 'Activities After Receive Application' is a loop node.
* 'Activities After Receive Application' has two child nodes: 'Validate Form and Assess Eligibility', and 'Request Missing Info'.
* 'Validate Form and Assess Eligibility' is a sequence node.
* 'Validate Form and Assess Eligibility' has two child nodes: 'Validate Form (VF)' and 'Assess Eligibility (AE)'.
* 'Request Missing Info' is a child of 'Activities After Receive Application'.
* 'Request Missing Info' has two child nodes: 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' and another 'Request Missing Info (RMI)'. The two 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' nodes are in a loop.
* 'Validate Form (VF)' and 'Assess Eligibility (AE)' are child nodes of 'Validate Form and Assess Eligibility'.

The process tree can be represented as follows:
```
          Archive Case (AC)
          /         \
        Send Confirmation (SC)  Approval Decision (AD)
