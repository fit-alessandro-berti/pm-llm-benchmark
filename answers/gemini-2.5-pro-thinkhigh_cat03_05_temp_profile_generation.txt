Based on the described global supply chain process, here is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile. The average times and standard deviations are estimated in seconds to reflect the complexity, potential delays, and variability inherent in such an operation.

The estimations cover pairs of activities that are directly sequential, as well as pairs separated by multiple steps, demonstrating the full scope of the temporal profile model.

```python
# Temporal Profile for a Global High-Tech Electronics Supply Chain
# All times are in seconds.
# 1 hour = 3600s | 1 day = 86400s | 1 week = 604800s

temporal_profile = {
    # --- Directly Sequential Activities ---

    # Supplier selection to order placement is an internal process, usually quick.
    ('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 172800),  # Avg: 3 days, Std Dev: 2 days

    # The longest and most variable part: international component shipping.
    ('OP', 'RC'): (2592000, 864000), # Avg: 30 days, Std Dev: 10 days

    # Receiving and intake before inspection is a quick, controlled internal step.
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 14400),    # Avg: 12 hours, Std Dev: 4 hours

    # Quality inspection can vary depending on batch quality and required tests.
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 86400),   # Avg: 2 days, Std Dev: 1 day

    # Assembly is a relatively stable part of the manufacturing line.
    ('CA', 'PT'): (432000, 86400),   # Avg: 5 days, Std Dev: 1 day

    # Product testing duration can vary if failures require re-work.
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 43200),    # Avg: 1 day, Std Dev: 12 hours

    # Packaging is a fast and highly standardized process.
    ('PK', 'WS'): (14400, 3600),     # Avg: 4 hours, Std Dev: 1 hour

    # Time in warehouse before shipping can vary based on logistics scheduling.
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 172800),  # Avg: 3 days, Std Dev: 2 days

    # Time until first after-sales contact is highly unpredictable and long-term.
    ('DT', 'AS'): (7776000, 5184000),# Avg: 90 days, Std Dev: 60 days


    # --- Non-Adjacent Activities (Illustrating Complexity) ---

    # From supplier selection until components are physically received.
    ('SS', 'RC'): (2851200, 881000), # Avg: ~33 days, Std Dev: ~10.2 days

    # From order placement until assembly begins.
    ('OP', 'CA'): (2808000, 868000), # Avg: ~32.5 days, Std Dev: ~10.05 days

    # The total time for core manufacturing: from inspection to packaging.
    ('QI', 'PK'): (691200, 129600),  # Avg: 8 days, Std Dev: 1.5 days

    # From the start of assembly until the product is shipped.
    ('CA', 'DT'): (792000, 200000),  # Avg: ~9.2 days, Std Dev: ~2.3 days

    # Total "order-to-ship" time: from selecting a supplier to distributing the product.
    ('SS', 'DT'): (3860000, 910000), # Avg: ~44.7 days, Std Dev: ~10.5 days

    # The entire process lifecycle from the very beginning to potential after-sales.
    ('SS', 'AS'): (11600000, 5250000)# Avg: ~134 days, Std Dev: ~60.8 days
