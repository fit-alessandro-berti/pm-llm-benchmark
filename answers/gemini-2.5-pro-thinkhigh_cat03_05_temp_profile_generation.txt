Based on the described global supply chain process, here is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile. The times are estimated in seconds to reflect the nature and complexity of each activity and the relationships between them.

The dictionary includes pairs of activities that are both directly and indirectly connected, with estimated averages and standard deviations that account for factors like international shipping, manufacturing complexity, and demand variability.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # --- Directly Adjacent or Short-Range Pairs ---

    # Procurement Phase: Can be lengthy and variable due to negotiations.
    ('SS', 'OP'): (1209600, 604800),  # Avg: 2 weeks, StDev: 1 week

    # Supplier Lead Time: Often the longest part, with high variability due to logistics.
    ('OP', 'RC'): (3628800, 1209600), # Avg: 6 weeks, StDev: 2 weeks

    # Internal Processing (Receiving & Inspection): Relatively quick and predictable.
    ('RC', 'QI'): (172800, 43200),     # Avg: 2 days, StDev: 12 hours

    # Manufacturing Phase: Assembly and testing are core, with moderate duration and variability.
    ('QI', 'CA'): (432000, 86400),     # Avg: 5 days, StDev: 1 day
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 64800),     # Avg: 3 days, StDev: 18 hours

    # Finalization and Storage: Packaging is fast and standardized; storage is variable.
    ('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 1800),       # Avg: 4 hours, StDev: 30 minutes
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 900),         # Avg: 2 hours, StDev: 15 minutes
    ('WS', 'DT'): (604800, 345600),    # Avg: 1 week, StDev: 4 days

    # Post-Sale Phase: Time until first support interaction is highly variable.
    ('DT', 'AS'): (7776000, 3888000), # Avg: 3 months, StDev: 1.5 months

    # --- Non-Adjacent Pairs (Eventually Following) ---

    # From Supplier Selection to Receiving Components
    ('SS', 'RC'): (4840000, 1350000), # Approx. 8 weeks total, with combined variability.

    # From Quality Inspection to Packaging (entire core production)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (705000, 108000),    # Approx. 8.2 days total.

    # From Component Assembly to Distribution (production, storage, and shipping prep)
    ('CA', 'DT'): (886000, 351000),    # Approx. 10.25 days total.

    # From Order Placement to Distribution (entire fulfillment cycle)
    ('OP', 'DT'): (5120000, 1260000), # Approx. 59 days total, dominated by shipping variance.

    # From Receiving Components to completing Product Testing
    ('RC', 'PT'): (864000, 116000),    # Exactly 10 days on average.

    # Entire process from initial Selection to final Distribution
    ('SS', 'DT'): (6330000, 1480000), # Approx. 73 days, covering the entire pre-sale lifecycle.
    
    # The full timespan from the very beginning to potential after-sales interaction
    ('SS', 'AS'): (14100000, 4130000) # Approx. 5.4 months, representing the product's early life.
