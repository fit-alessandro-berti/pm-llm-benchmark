Here is a single, fully–parenthesized process–tree expression that captures **every** behaviour allowed in the textual description.  
(The expression is deliberately indented so that every operator and its direct children line-up vertically – copy/paste it into any Python string and it remains valid.)

                            FAS,
                            ->(

                                +(                  # 7. Financial / clerical clearance – AND
                                    BL,
                                    ICP,
                                    MRF
                                )
                            )
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

The `tau` leaf in the first argument of the `*` operator is the “guard” that decides, immediately after the initial test, whether the loop body has to be executed at all; after every loop iteration the same guard is evaluated again until the (silent) decision is “exit”.
