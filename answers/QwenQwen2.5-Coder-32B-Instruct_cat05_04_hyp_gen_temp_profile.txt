### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: Average time is about 25 hours with a very low standard deviation of 1 hour. This suggests a rigid, possibly artificial schedule for approval that could be influenced by system automation or other procedural rules.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: An extremely long average delay of 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days. This inconsistency indicates potential internal backlog issues or resource constraints that cause delays.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**: The average closure time is 2 hours after assignment, without consistently seeing intermediate steps like Evaluate or Approve. This suggests claims may be prematurely closed.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: The time between evaluation and notification is only 5 minutes on average, indicating a potentially too-quick transition that might skip intermediate steps.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Automated approval processes might be causing claims to move quickly from receipt to approval with little manual intervention.
   - **Verification**: Check if there are any automated workflows or triggers that might be causing this rapid transition.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Delays could be due to a backlog of claims or resource constraints, such as insufficient staff or pending approvals.
   - **Verification**: Look for periods of high claim volume or resource allocation issues.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Claims may be prematurely closed without proper evaluation or approval, possibly due to errors or oversights in the process.
   - **Verification**: Identify claims that move from assignment to closure quickly and check for missing evaluation or approval steps.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Automated notifications might be sending alerts immediately after evaluation, possibly bypassing intermediate steps.
   - **Verification**: Investigate if there are any automated notification systems that could trigger alerts too quickly.

### Verification SQL Queries

1. **Identify claims with abnormal R to P intervals:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) AS r_to_p_time
   FROM 
       claim_events
   WHERE 
       activity IN ('R', 'P')
   GROUP BY 
       claim_id
   HAVING 
       r_to_p_time NOT BETWEEN (3600 - 3*600) AND (3600 + 3*600);  -- 3 sigma range
   ```

2. **Identify claims with abnormal P to N intervals:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) AS p_to_n_time
   FROM 
       claim_events
   WHERE 
       activity IN ('P', 'N')
   GROUP BY 
       claim_id
   HAVING 
       p_to_n_time NOT BETWEEN (604800 - 3*172800) AND (604800 + 3*172800);  -- 3 sigma range
   ```

3. **Identify claims with abnormal A to C intervals:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))) AS a_to_c_time
   FROM 
       claim_events
   WHERE 
       activity IN ('A', 'C')
   GROUP BY 
       claim_id
   HAVING 
       a_to_c_time NOT BETWEEN (7200 - 3*3600) AND (7200 + 3*3600);  -- 3 sigma range
   ```

4. **Identify claims with abnormal E to N intervals:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END))) AS e_to_n_time
   FROM 
       claim_events
   WHERE 
       activity IN ('E', 'N')
   GROUP BY 
       claim_id
   HAVING 
       e_to_n_time NOT BETWEEN (300 - 3*60) AND (300 + 3*60);  -- 3 sigma range
   ```

5. **Correlate anomalies with adjusters:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       c.adjuster_id, 
       COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
   FROM 
       claim_events e
   JOIN 
       (SELECT 
           claim_id, 
           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) AS p_to_n_time
        FROM 
            claim_events
        WHERE 
            activity IN ('P', 'N')
        GROUP BY 
            claim_id
        HAVING 
            p_to_n_time NOT BETWEEN (604800 - 3*172800) AND (604800 + 3*172800)) c
   ON 
       e.claim_id = c.claim_id
   WHERE 
       e.activity = 'N'
   GROUP BY 
       c.adjuster_id
   ORDER BY 
       anomaly_count DESC;
   ```

6. **Filter claims with quick assignment to closure (Indicator of potential premature closure):**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))) AS a_to_c_time
   FROM 
       claim_events
   WHERE 
       activity IN ('A', 'C')
   GROUP BY 
       claim_id
   HAVING 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))) <= 7200  -- 2 hours
   AND 
       NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claim_id AND activity = 'E');
   ```

7. **Filter claims with extensive approval-to-notification delay:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))) AS a_to_n_time
   FROM 
       claim_events
   WHERE 
       activity IN ('A', 'N')
   GROUP BY 
       claim_id
   HAVING 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))) >= 604800;  -- 7 days
   ```

These queries will help identify specific claims with unusual timing and correlate these anomalies with adjusters, claim types, or other relevant factors to further investigate potential issues.
