**Explanation of Violations:**

1. **Case 2:**
    - **Violation:** In this case, the "Package items" activity occurs before the "Authorize payment" activity, which is not in accordance with the normative process.
    - **Explanation:** The normative process explicitly states that after checking inventory, the next step should be to authorize payment. Only after payment authorization should the items be prepared for shipment (package items). Therefore, the sequence should be "Check, Authorize, Package" instead of "Check, Package, Authorize."
  
2. **Case 3:**
    - **Violation:** In this case, the "Ship order" activity occurs after the "Cancel order" activity, which goes against the expected flow of the process.
    - **Explanation:** The normative process clearly states that if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order, the process should branch into a cancellation scenario. Once an order is canceled, activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping) should not proceed. Therefore, "Shipping" after "Cancellation" is a violation of the expected sequence.

3. **Case 4:**
    - **Violation:** In this case, the "Cancel order" activity occurs before the "Authorize payment" activity, leading to a violation of the normative process.
    - **Explanation:** The normative process outlines that if the inventory check reveals insufficient stock, the process should directly proceed to canceling the order. However, the order of operations before cancellation should still follow the sequence "Check inventory" and "Authorize payment" to ensure that the logical flow is maintained. In this case, skipping the payment authorization step before cancellation deviates from the expected process.

By identifying these violations, we can see where the cases in the event log diverge from the expected normative process, highlighting where improvements in process adherence can be made.
