We are creating a temporal profile for a global supply chain process. The activities are:
 SS: Supplier Selection
 OP: Order Placement
 RC: Receive Components
 QI: Quality Inspection
 CA: Component Assembly
 PT: Product Testing
 PK: Packaging
 WS: Warehouse Storage
 DT: Distribution
 AS: After-Sales Support

 We need to consider pairs of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one trace. This includes not only consecutive activities but also those that are separated by one or more steps.

 We'll estimate the average time and standard deviation for each pair. The times should be in seconds.

 Steps:
 1. Identify pairs: We'll consider every pair (A, B) such that A comes before B in some trace.
 2. We'll assign reasonable estimates for the average time and standard deviation based on typical supply chain operations.

 Important: We must consider the entire process and the typical time lags between activities that might be separated by multiple steps.

 Example pairs:
   Direct pairs: 
      ('SS', 'OP'): from supplier selection to order placement (should be quick)
      ('OP', 'RC'): order placement to receiving components (this can take days or weeks)
      ('RC', 'QI'): receiving to inspection (usually quick)
      ('QI', 'CA'): inspection to assembly (quick)
      ('CA', 'PT'): assembly to testing (quick)
      ('PT', 'PK'): testing to packaging (quick)
      ('PK', 'WS'): packaging to storage (quick)
      ('WS', 'DT'): storage to distribution (could be days)
      ('DT', 'AS'): distribution to after-sales (this can be weeks or months)

  Also, non-consecutive pairs:
      ('SS', 'RC'): from supplier selection to receiving components (includes OP time)
      ('OP', 'QI'): order placement to quality inspection (includes RC time)
      ... and so on.

 Approach:
 We'll break the process into stages and assign typical times for each stage. Then, for pairs that span multiple stages, we can add the average times and combine the variances (since variances add for independent random variables) to get the standard deviation? However, note: the standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of the variances.

 But note: the problem does not require independence, but we are modeling the time between two activities that may be separated by multiple steps. We can model the time as the sum of the intermediate steps? However, the temporal profile is defined for the time between two activities regardless of what happens in between. We are not necessarily decomposing it.

 Since we are to estimate without explicit numerical temporal information, we'll use domain knowledge to assign reasonable averages and standard deviations for each pair.

 However, note: the problem says "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt", meaning we are to use our own estimation.

 We'll create a dictionary for the pairs we consider important. We don't have to include every possible pair, but a representative subset.

 Let's define some typical time frames:

  - Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP): This is a decision-making step, might take a few days. Let's say average 2 days (172800 seconds) with a standard deviation of 1 day (86400 seconds).
  - Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC): This is the supplier lead time. Could be highly variable. For high-tech components, let's say average 14 days (1209600 seconds) with a standard deviation of 3 days (259200 seconds).
  - Receive Components (RC) to Quality Inspection (QI): This is usually done within a day. Average 1 day (86400 seconds) with std dev 12 hours (43200 seconds).
  - Quality Inspection (QI) to Component Assembly (CA): If inspection passes, assembly starts quickly. Average 12 hours (43200 seconds) with std dev 6 hours (21600 seconds).
  - Component Assembly (CA) to Product Testing (PT): Assembly might take a few days. Let's say average 3 days (259200 seconds) with std dev 1 day (86400 seconds).
  - Product Testing (PT) to Packaging (PK): If the product passes, packaging is quick. Average 8 hours (28800 seconds) with std dev 4 hours (14400 seconds).
  - Packaging (PK) to Warehouse Storage (WS): This is moving the product to the warehouse. Average 1 day (86400 seconds) with std dev 12 hours (43200 seconds).
  - Warehouse Storage (WS) to Distribution (DT): This depends on orders. Could be stored for a while. Average 7 days (604800 seconds) with std dev 2 days (172800 seconds).
  - Distribution (DT) to After-Sales Support (AS): After-sales starts after the product is sold and delivered. This can be a long time. Let's say average 30 days (2592000 seconds) with std dev 10 days (864000 seconds).

 Now, for non-consecutive pairs, we can compute the average as the sum of the averages of the intermediate steps? But note: the temporal profile is for the time between two activities regardless of the path. However, in a linear process (as described) the path is fixed? Actually, the process might have variations, but the problem does not specify any loops or branches. We'll assume a linear sequence for simplicity.

 Therefore, for a pair (A, B) that are separated by multiple steps, the average time would be the sum of the average times of the consecutive pairs from A to B. And the variance would be the sum of the variances of the consecutive pairs, so the standard deviation would be sqrt(sum of variances).

 Example: 
   ('SS', 'RC'): 
        steps: SS->OP, OP->RC
        average = avg(SS,OP) + avg(OP,RC) = 172800 + 1209600 = 1382400 seconds.
        variance = (86400)^2 + (259200)^2 = 7464960000 + 67184640000 = 7464960000 + 67184640000 = 7464960000 is 7.46496e9, 67184640000 is 6.718464e10 -> total variance 7.46496e9 + 6.718464e10 = 7.46496e9 is 0.746496e10, so total 7.46496e10? Actually: 7.46496e9 + 67.18464e9 = 74.6496e9 -> 7.46496e10.
        std dev = sqrt(7.46496e10)  273,200 seconds (about 3.16 days). But note: 273200 seconds is about 3.16 days? 273200 / 86400  3.16. However, the average time is 16 days (1382400/86400=16). So std dev of 3.16 days.

 But wait: we are not forced to compute it that way. We could also assign a direct estimate. However, the problem says "the temporal profile is a model describing the average and the standard deviation of the times between couples of activities that eventually follow each other". We are free to assign based on our understanding.

 Since the process is linear, we can compute non-consecutive pairs by summing the consecutive ones. But note: the problem does not specify that the process is linear. However, the activities are listed in a sequence. We'll assume that the typical trace is sequential: SS -> OP -> RC -> QI -> CA -> PT -> PK -> WS -> DT -> AS.

 Therefore, we can define the consecutive pairs and then for non-consecutive pairs, we can compute by adding the consecutive steps in between.

 However, note: the problem says "eventually follow each other in at least one process execution". In a linear sequence, every activity A that comes before activity B will have a pair (A,B).

 We'll generate the pairs for every combination of activities in the order of the sequence.

 Steps in order: [SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS]

 We'll generate:
   (SS, OP), (SS, RC), (SS, QI), ... (SS, AS)
   (OP, RC), (OP, QI), ... (OP, AS)
   ... until (DT, AS)

 We have 10 activities -> 45 pairs.

 But note: we are to produce a representative subset? The problem says "construct a dictionary that includes a representative subset". However, the example had two pairs. But the scenario says "ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps". So we should include several non-consecutive pairs.

 We'll include:
   All consecutive pairs (8 pairs: from SS->OP to DT->AS)
   And some non-consecutive pairs: e.g., SS->RC, SS->CA, SS->PT, SS->DT, SS->AS, OP->QI, OP->CA, OP->PT, OP->DT, OP->AS, RC->PT, RC->AS, QI->AS, CA->AS, PT->AS, etc.

 But 45 pairs is too many? We'll choose a subset. Let's include:

   Consecutive pairs (8 pairs):
      ('SS','OP'), ('OP','RC'), ('RC','QI'), ('QI','CA'), ('CA','PT'), ('PT','PK'), ('PK','WS'), ('WS','DT'), ('DT','AS')   -> 9 pairs? Actually 9 consecutive pairs? Because from SS to OP (1), OP to RC (2), ... until DT to AS (9). So 9 consecutive pairs.

   And then we'll add 6 non-consecutive pairs to have a total of 15 pairs? Or more? Let's aim for about 15-20 pairs.

   Non-consecutive pairs we choose:
      ('SS','RC')   [skipping OP]
      ('SS','QI')   [skipping OP,RC]
      ('SS','CA')   [skipping OP,RC,QI]
      ('SS','PT')   [skipping until PT]
      ('SS','AS')   [the entire process]
      ('OP','QI')   [skipping RC]
      ('OP','CA')   [skipping RC,QI]
      ('OP','AS')   [from OP to AS]
      ('RC','PT')   [skipping QI,CA]
      ('RC','AS')   [from RC to AS]
      ('QI','AS')   [from QI to AS]
      ('CA','AS')   [from CA to AS]
      ('PT','AS')   [from PT to AS]

 That's 13 non-consecutive pairs. Total 9 + 13 = 22 pairs.

 How to compute non-consecutive pairs?
   For a pair (A, B): 
        average = sum of averages of consecutive steps from A to B.
        variance = sum of variances of consecutive steps from A to B.
        standard deviation = sqrt(variance)

 Example: 
   ('SS','RC') = ('SS','OP') + ('OP','RC')
        avg = 172800 + 1209600 = 1382400
        var = (86400)^2 + (259200)^2 = 7464960000 + 67184640000 = 7464960000 + 67184640000 = 7464960000 is 7.46496e9, 67184640000 is 6.718464e10 -> total 7.46496e9 + 6.718464e10 = 7.46496e10? Actually: 7.46496e9 is 7,464,960,000 and 67,184,640,000 -> total 74,649,600,000 -> 7.46496e10
        std_dev = sqrt(7.46496e10)  273,200 seconds.

 But note: we must be cautious because the standard deviation of the sum is the square root of the sum of variances only if the variables are independent. We assume independence for simplicity.

 However, in reality, the times might be correlated. But without more information, we use this method.

 Steps:

 1. Define the consecutive pairs with their average and std_dev (as above).
 2. For non-consecutive pairs, we break the path into consecutive steps and sum the averages and the variances.

 We'll create a list of consecutive pairs and their (avg, std_dev). Then for a non-consecutive pair, we'll find the path (which is contiguous in the sequence) and sum the averages and the variances.

 Implementation:

   Let the activities be in order: 
        activities = ['SS','OP','RC','QI','CA','PT','PK','WS','DT','AS']

   We'll create a dictionary for consecutive pairs first.

   consecutive_pairs = {
        ('SS','OP'): (172800, 86400),
        ('OP','RC'): (1209600, 259200),
        ('RC','QI'): (86400, 43200),
        ('QI','CA'): (43200, 21600),
        ('CA','PT'): (259200, 86400),
        ('PT','PK'): (28800, 14400),
        ('PK','WS'): (86400, 43200),
        ('WS','DT'): (604800, 172800),
        ('DT','AS'): (2592000, 864000)
   }

   Then for a non-consecutive pair (A, B):
        Let i = index of A, j = index of B (with j>i)
        Then the path is from i to j: consecutive pairs (A, next), (next, next_next), ... until B.
        average = sum( consecutive_pairs[ (step_k, step_{k+1}) ][0] for k from i to j-1 )
        variance = sum( (consecutive_pairs[ (step_k, step_{k+1}) ][1])**2 for k from i to j-1 )
        std_dev = sqrt(variance)

   Then assign (average, std_dev) to the pair (A,B).

 Example: ('SS','RC'):
        steps: [('SS','OP'), ('OP','RC')]
        avg = 172800 + 1209600 = 1382400
        var = (86400)**2 + (259200)**2 = 7464960000 + 67184640000 = 7464960000 + 67184640000 = 7464960000 is 7.46496e9, 67184640000 is 6.718464e10 -> total 7.46496e10
        std_dev = sqrt(7.46496e10)  273200 (rounded to the nearest hundred? we'll compute exactly)

 But note: we are going to write the numbers. We can round to reasonable significant figures? Since the numbers are large, we can round to the nearest thousand or hundred thousand? But let's compute exactly and then round if needed.

 However, the problem does not specify rounding. We'll use the exact computed numbers.

 But note: the example had exact numbers (like 86400). We'll keep the numbers as integers.

 Let's compute the non-consecutive pairs:

   ('SS','QI'): 
        steps: SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI
        avg = 172800 + 1209600 + 86400 = 1382400 + 86400 = 1468800
        var = (86400)**2 + (259200)**2 + (43200)**2 = 7464960000 + 67184640000 + 1866240000 = 7464960000+1866240000=9331200000 + 67184640000 = 76515840000
        std_dev = sqrt(76515840000)  276616   [because 276616^2 = 76515840000? Let me check: 276616*276616. Actually, we can compute: sqrt(76515840000)=276616.000000? Actually, 276616^2 = (270000+6616)^2 = ... but we can use calculator. Alternatively, we can leave it as the square root and then round? But we'll compute numerically: sqrt(76515840000) = 276616.000000 approximately? Actually, 276616^2 = 76515840000? Let me compute: 276616 * 276616 -> 276616 * 276616 = (276000+616)^2 = 276000^2 + 2*276000*616 + 616^2 = 76176000000 + 340032000 + 379456 = 76176000000+340032000=76516032000+379456=76516411456 -> which is more than 76515840000. So we'll round to 276600? Actually, we can compute exactly: sqrt(76515840000) = 100 * sqrt(7651584) -> but easier to use: 276600^2 = 76507560000, which is less. Then 276616 is too high? Let me compute: 276600^2 = 76507560000, then 276610^2 = (276600+10)^2 = 76507560000 + 2*276600*10 + 10^2 = 76507560000+5532000+100=76513092100. Then 276620^2 = (276600+20)^2 = 76507560000+2*276600*20+400=76507560000+11064000+400=76518624400. Our target is 76515840000. So between 276610 and 276620. We can use: 
        276615^2 = (276600+15)^2 = 76507560000 + 2*276600*15 + 15^2 = 76507560000 + 8298000 + 225 = 76515850225 -> which is 10225 more than 76515840000. So sqrt(76515840000) is about 276615 - (10225/(2*276615))  276615 - 10225/(553230)  276615 - 0.0185  276614.98. So we round to 276615 seconds.

 But note: we are not required to be extremely precise. We'll compute the variance and then take the square root and round to the nearest integer.

 Alternatively, we can avoid these computations and just define the consecutive pairs and then let the non-consecutive pairs be computed by the same method. But we are writing the dictionary.

 We'll write a small program to compute the non-consecutive pairs? But note: we are to output the dictionary. We can compute the numbers and then write them.

 However, we are to write the code for the dictionary. We'll compute the non-consecutive pairs by hand? That's error-prone. Instead, we'll write a helper function in our mind.

 Alternatively, we can write the consecutive pairs and then for non-consecutive pairs, we'll compute the average and std_dev and then round to reasonable numbers.

 Let me do:

   consecutive_pairs = {
        ('SS','OP'): (172800, 86400),   # 2 days ± 1 day
        ('OP','RC'): (1209600, 259200),  # 14 days ± 3 days
        ('RC','QI'): (86400, 43200),     # 1 day ± 0.5 day
        ('QI','CA'): (43200, 21600),     # 0.5 day ± 0.25 day
        ('CA','PT'): (259200, 86400),    # 3 days ± 1 day
        ('PT','PK'): (28800, 14400),     # 8 hours ± 4 hours
        ('PK','WS'): (86400, 43200),     # 1 day ± 0.5 day
        ('WS','DT'): (604800, 172800),   # 7 days ± 2 days
        ('DT','AS'): (2592000, 864000)   # 30 days ± 10 days
   }

   Now, for a non-consecutive pair, say ('SS','QI'):
        steps: [('SS','OP'), ('OP','RC'), ('RC','QI')]
        avg = 172800 + 1209600 + 86400 = 1468800
        var = 86400**2 + 259200**2 + 43200**2 = 7464960000 + 67184640000 + 1866240000 = 
            7464960000 + 1866240000 = 9331200000
            9331200000 + 67184640000 = 76515840000
        std_dev = round(sqrt(76515840000))   -> we compute: sqrt(76515840000) = 276615 (as above) -> so 276615

   But note: we can round to the nearest thousand? 277000? But the consecutive pairs are given without rounding. We'll keep as integer.

   However, the numbers are large. We can round to the nearest 1000? But the example had exact numbers. Let's keep the exact computed numbers.

   We'll compute each non-consecutive pair similarly.

   We'll do one more: ('SS','AS') -> the entire process.
        steps: all consecutive pairs from SS to AS: 9 pairs.
        avg = 172800 + 1209600 + 86400 + 43200 + 259200 + 28800 + 86400 + 604800 + 2592000
        Let's add:
          172800
         1209600 -> 1382400
          86400 -> 1468800
          43200 -> 1512000
         259200 -> 1771200
          28800 -> 1800000
          86400 -> 1886400
         604800 -> 2491200
        2592000 -> 5083200 seconds.

        var = (86400)**2 + (259200)**2 + (43200)**2 + (21600)**2 + (86400)**2 + (14400)**2 + (43200)**2 + (172800)**2 + (864000)**2
        = 7464960000 + 67184640000 + 1866240000 + 466560000 + 7464960000 + 207360000 + 1866240000 + 29859840000 + 746496000000

        Let me compute step by step:

          86400**2 = 7,464,960,000
          259200**2 = 67,184,640,000
          43200**2 = 1,866,240,000
          21600**2 = 466,560,000
          86400**2 = 7,464,960,000
          14400**2 = 207,360,000
          43200**2 = 1,866,240,000
          172800**2 = 29,859,840,000
          864000**2 = 746,496,000,000

        Now sum:

          7,464,960,000
         67,184,640,000 -> 74,649,600,000
          1,866,240,000 -> 76,515,840,000
            466,560,000 -> 76,982,400,000
          7,464,960,000 -> 84,447,360,000
            207,360,000 -> 84,654,720,000
          1,866,240,000 -> 86,520,960,000
         29,859,840,000 -> 116,380,800,000
        746,496,000,000 -> 862,876,800,000

        std_dev = sqrt(862876800000)  928,000 seconds? Let me compute: 928000^2 = 861,184,000,000 -> which is less. 929000^2 = 863,041,000,000 -> too big. 928,500^2 = (928000+500)^2 = 928000^2 + 2*928000*500 + 500^2 = 861184000000 + 928000000 + 250000 = 862112250000 -> still less than 862876800000. Then 928,800^2 = (928000+800)^2 = 861184000000 + 2*928000*800 + 800^2 = 861184000000 + 1,484,800,000 + 640000 = 862,668,800,000 + 640000 = 862,668,800,000? Then 928,900^2 = (929000-100)^2 = 863041000000 - 2*929000*100 + 10000 = 863041000000 - 185800000 + 10000 = 862,855,210,000 -> which is less than 862876800000. Then 928,950^2 = (929000-50)^2 = 863041000000 - 2*929000*50 + 2500 = 863041000000 - 92,900,000 + 2500 = 862,948,102,500 -> too big. So between 928900 and 928950. We can approximate 928910^2 = (928900+10)^2 = 862855210000 + 2*928900*10 + 100 = 862855210000+18,578,000+100 = 862,873,788,100 -> then 928920^2 = 862855210000 + 2*928900*20 + 400 = 862855210000+37,156,000+400=862,892,366,400 -> too big. So 928910 is about 862,873,788,100 and we need 862,876,800,000 -> difference 3,011,900,000. The derivative: 2*928910 per unit, so increment = 3011900000/(2*928910)  3011900000/1,857,820  1621. So 928910+1621930531? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, we can use: sqrt(862876800000)  928,910.5? But note: we are rounding to the nearest integer. We'll compute:

        sqrt(862876800000)  928,910.6 -> so we round to 928911 seconds.

   This is cumbersome. We might decide to round the standard deviations to a coarser resolution? Or we can use the consecutive pairs and then for non-consecutive pairs, we don't have to write the exact number? But the problem doesn't specify.

   Alternatively, we can avoid such large numbers and use days as the unit? But the example was in seconds.

   We'll stick to seconds and round the standard deviations to the nearest thousand? Or ten thousand? But the consecutive pairs are given without rounding. We'll compute the non-consecutive pairs and round the standard deviation to the nearest thousand.

   For ('SS','AS'):
        std_dev = round(sqrt(862876800000) / 1000) * 1000 -> 928911 -> round to 929000 seconds? Or 928000? Actually, 928911 is closer to 929000? But 928911-928000=911, 929000-928911=89 -> so closer to 929000? But 911>89? Actually, 928911 is 89 away from 929000 and 911 away from 928000? So 929000 is closer? But 928911 is less than 929000. The difference to 929000 is 89, and to 928000 is 911. So we round to 929000.

   However, we'll do this consistently? We'll round the standard deviation to the nearest 1000 seconds for non-consecutive pairs? But consecutive pairs are exact.

   Alternatively, we can avoid rounding and use the exact computed integer? But the numbers are very large and the standard deviation might be an integer? Not necessarily.

   We'll output the numbers as integers, rounded to the nearest integer.

   For ('SS','AS'): std_dev = 928911 seconds.

   But note: the variance was 862876800000, and sqrt(862876800000) is not an integer. We'll use integer representation.

   We'll do the computation for each non-consecutive pair and write the integer value.

   However, for brevity, we'll compute the non-consecutive pairs and then write the dictionary.

   We'll compute:

   pairs = [
        # consecutive pairs (already defined)
        ('SS','OP'), ('OP','RC'), ('RC','QI'), ('QI','CA'), ('CA','PT'), ('PT','PK'), ('PK','WS'), ('WS','DT'), ('DT','AS'),
        # non-consecutive pairs
        ('SS','RC'), ('SS','QI'), ('SS','CA'), ('SS','PT'), ('SS','AS'),
        ('OP','QI'), ('OP','CA'), ('OP','AS'),
        ('RC','PT'), ('RC','AS'),
        ('QI','AS'),
        ('CA','AS'),
        ('PT','AS')
   ]

   We'll compute the non-consecutive ones:

   ('SS','RC'): 
        steps: [('SS','OP'),('OP','RC')]
        avg = 172800+1209600 = 1382400
        var = 86400**2 + 259200**2 = 7464960000 + 67184640000 = 7464960000+67184640000 = 74649600000? Wait, 7464960000 is 7.46496e9, 67184640000 is 6.718464e10 -> total 7.46496e9+67.18464e9 = 74.6496e9 -> 74649600000? Actually, 7,464,960,000 + 67,184,640,000 = 74,649,600,000 -> 74649600000? But 74,649,600,000 is 7.46496e10 -> 74649600000 is 7.46496e10? Actually, 74,649,600,000 = 74649600000? Yes, 74,649,600,000 has 10 zeros? 74,649,600,000 is 7.46496e10 -> 74649600000 is 7.46496e10? Actually, 74,649,600,000 = 7.46496e10, and 74649600000 is 7.46496e10? They are the same? Actually, 74,649,600,000 = 74649600000? No: 74,649,600,000 is 74 billion, 649 million, 600 thousand -> 74649600000 is 74 billion, 649 million, 600 thousand? Actually, 74,649,600,000 = 74,649,600,000 and 74,649,600,000 is 7.46496e10. And 74649600000 is 7.46496e10? Yes, because 7.46496e10 = 74,649,600,000.

        So var = 74649600000
        std_dev = sqrt(74649600000) = 273,200? Because 273200^2 = 74649600000? 
          273200 * 273200 = (270000+3200)^2 = 270000^2 + 2*270000*3200 + 3200^2 = 72900000000 + 1,728,000,000 + 10,240,000 = 72900000000+1728000000=74628000000+10240000=74638240000 -> not 74649600000. 
        Actually, 273200^2 = 74,638,240,000? Then we need to compute: 
          sqrt(74649600000) = 273,200 is too low. 273,300^2 = (273000+300)^2 = 273000^2 + 2*273000*300 + 300^2 = 74529000000 + 163800000 + 90000 = 74692800000+90000=74692890000 -> too high. 
        So between 273200 and 273300. 
        We can compute: 
          273250^2 = (273200+50)^2 = 273200^2 + 2*273200*50 + 50^2 = 74638240000 + 27,320,000 + 2,500 = 74,665,622,500 -> too high? 
        Actually, 273210^2 = (273200+10)^2 = 74638240000 + 2*273200*10 + 100 = 74638240000+5,464,000+100=74,643,864,100 -> still less than 74,649,600,000.
        273220^2 = 273210^2 + 2*273210*10 + 10^2 = 74643864100 + 5,464,200 + 100 = 74,649,105,400 -> still less? 
        273230^2 = 273220^2 + 2*273220*10 + 10^2 = 74649105400 + 5,464,400 + 100 = 74,654,598,500 -> too high.

        So between 273220 and 273230. 
        The target: 74,649,600,000 - 74,649,105,400 = 494,600.
        The increment per unit: about 2*273220 = 546440 per unit? So we need about 494600/546440  0.9 units. So 273220.9 -> which is 273221.

        Therefore, std_dev = 273221 seconds.

   This is too detailed. We'll use a different approach: we'll define the consecutive pairs and then for non-consecutive pairs, we'll use the following:

        average = sum of the averages of the consecutive steps in between.
        std_dev = round( sqrt( sum( (std_dev_i)**2 for each consecutive step in between ) )

   And we'll compute the square root and round to the nearest integer.

   We'll do this for each non-consecutive pair.

   Given time constraints, we'll compute a few and then write the dictionary.

   We'll compute:

   non_consecutive_pairs = {
        ('SS','RC'): (1382400, 273221),   # computed above
        ('SS','QI'): (1468800, 276615),   # computed above
        ('SS','CA'): (1468800+43200=1512000, round(sqrt(76515840000 + (21600)**2)) ) -> wait, no: 
            steps: SS->OP->RC->QI->CA: so 4 steps: SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA.
            avg = 172800+1209600+86400+43200 = 1512000
            var = 86400**2 + 259200**2 + 43200**2 + 21600**2 = 7464960000+67184640000+1866240000+466560000 = 7464960000+1866240000=9331200000, then 9331200000+67184640000=76515840000, then +466560000=76982400000
            std_dev = sqrt(76982400000) = 277,456 seconds? (we'll compute: 277456^2 = ?) -> we'll use 277456.

        ... and so on.

   This is becoming very time-consuming.

   Alternative plan: we'll output only the consecutive pairs and a few non-consecutive pairs that we can easily estimate without computation, and for those we'll use a direct estimate.

   We'll do:

        consecutive_pairs: 9 pairs as above.

        non-consecutive_pairs: we choose a few and assign directly by domain knowledge.

   For example:

        ('SS','RC'): we know it's about 16 days (1382400 seconds) and we can assign a std_dev of 3 days (259200 seconds) because the supplier lead time is the most variable part.

        ('SS','AS'): the entire process, average 5083200 seconds (about 58.8 days) and std_dev 30 days? (2592000 seconds) because of the after-sales part.

   But then we are not being consistent.

   Given the complexity, we decide to output only the consecutive pairs and one non-consecutive pair ('SS','AS') as an example.

   But the problem says "ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps", so we need at least one non-consecutive pair.

   We'll include:

        consecutive_pairs: 9 pairs.

        and 5 non-consecutive pairs: 
            ('SS','RC'), 
            ('SS','QI'),
            ('SS','PT'),
            ('SS','AS'),
            ('OP','AS')

   For these non-consecutive pairs, we'll use the summed average and for std_dev we'll use the square root of the sum of squares of the std_dev of the consecutive steps in between, rounded to the nearest integer.

   We'll compute:

        activities = ['SS','OP','RC','QI','CA','PT','PK','WS','DT','AS']

        consecutive_dict = {
            ('SS','OP'): (172800, 86400),

Then 290550^2 = (290500+50)^2 = 84390250000 + 2*290500*50 + 2500 = 84390250000+2,905,000+2500=843,902,50000+2,905,000=843,932,00000? Let me do: 
          84390250000
          +2905000 = 84393155000
          +2500 = 84393157500 -> then 290600^2= (290550+50)^2 = 84393157500 + 2*290550*50 + 2500 = 84393157500+2,905,500*10? Wait, 2*290550*50 = 29,055,000 -> then +2500 = 29,057,500. So 84393157500+29057500=84422215000. This is not matching. 

        Alternatively, we can use: 
          sqrt(84447360000) = 290,600. approximately? because 290600^2 = 84,448,360,000 -> which is 84448360000, and we have 84447360000 -> difference 10000000. 
          So adjustment: decrement by 10000000/(2*290600) = 10000000/581200  17.2. So 290600-17 = 290583.

        We'll use 290,000 seconds? That's not accurate. We'll use 290600 seconds.

        Actually, 290600^2 = 84,448,360,000 -> which is 84448360000, and we need 84447360000 -> difference 1,000,000. So std_dev = sqrt(84447360000) = sqrt(84448360000 - 1000000)  290600 - (1000000)/(2*290600) = 290600 - 1000000/581200  290600 - 1.72  290598.28 -> round to 290598.

Our target is 855,411,840,000. 
        So between 924,900 and 924,950. 
        924,920^2 = (924,900+20)^2 = 855440010000 + 2*924900*20 + 400 = 855440010000+36,996,000+400 = 855,477,006,400 -> too high.
        924,910^2 = (924,900+10)^2 = 855440010000 + 2*924900*10 + 100 = 855440010000+18,498,000+100 = 855,458,508,100 -> still high.
        924,905^2 = (924,900+5)^2 = 855440010000 + 2*924900*5 + 25 = 855440010000+9,249,000+25 = 855,449,259,025 -> still high.
        924, code an approximation: 
          difference from 924,900: 855,411,840,000 - 855,440,010,000 = -28,170,000 (so below)
        so try 924,890: (924,900-10)^2 = 855440010000 - 2*924900*10 + 100 = 855440010000 - 18,498,000 + 100 = 855,421,512,100 -> still above 855,411,840,000.
        924,880: (924,900-20)^2 = 855440010000 - 2*924900*20 + 400 = 855440010000 - 36,996,000 + 400 = 855,403,014,400 -> below.
        So between 924,880 and 924,890.
        924,885: (924,880+5)^2 = 855403014400 + 2*924880*5 + 25 = 855403014400 + 9,248,800 + 25 = 855,412,263,225 -> which is above 855,411,840,000.
        924,882: (924,880+2)^2 = 855403014400 + 2*924880*2 + 4 = 855403014400+3,699,520+4 = 855,406,713,924 -> below.
        This is taking too long. We'll use 924,882 as the starting point and then add the necessary increment. 

        Alternatively, we'll use: 
          sqrt(855411840000) = 924, approximately 924,882.5? 

        We'll round to 924,883 seconds.

   Given the time, we decide to output the consecutive pairs and the non-consecutive pairs with the computed values.

   We'll create the dictionary with 9 + 5 = 14 pairs.

   The dictionary will be:

   temporal_profile = {
        # consecutive pairs
        ('SS','OP'): (172800, 86400),
        ('OP','RC'): (1209600, 259200),
        ('RC','QI'): (86400, 43200),
        ('QI','CA'): (43200, 21600),
        ('CA','PT'): (259200, 86400),
        ('PT','PK'): (28800, 14400),
        ('PK','WS'): (86400, 43200),
        ('WS','DT'): (604800, 172800),
        ('DT','AS'): (2592000, 864000),

        # non-consecutive pairs
        ('SS','RC'): (1382400, 273221),
        ('SS','QI'): (1468800, 276615),
        ('SS','PT'): (1771200, 290598),
        ('SS','AS'): (5083200, 928911),
        ('OP','AS'): (4910400, 924883)
   }

   This meets the requirement of having non-consecutive pairs.

   Note: The numbers are large integers. We hope they are reasonable.

   Let me check one: ('SS','AS'): average is 5083200 seconds = 5083200/86400 = 58.833 days -> about 2 months, which is plausible for a global supply chain.

   We'll output this dictionary.
</think>
Based on the global supply chain process for high-tech electronics, I've constructed a temporal profile dictionary that includes both consecutive activity pairs and representative non-consecutive pairs (accounting for multi-step relationships). The times are estimated in seconds, reflecting realistic durations and variability for each stage of the process.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Consecutive activity pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 86400),     # Supplier Selection to Order Placement
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 259200),   # Order Placement to Receive Components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200),      # Receive Components to Quality Inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 21600),      # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),     # Component Assembly to Product Testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (28800, 14400),      # Product Testing to Packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 43200),      # Packaging to Warehouse Storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (604800, 172800),    # Warehouse Storage to Distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 864000),   # Distribution to After-Sales Support
    
    # Non-consecutive pairs (multi-step relationships)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1382400, 273221),   # SSOPRC (supplier selection to component receipt)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (1468800, 276615),   # SSOPRCQI (supplier selection to inspection)
    ('SS', 'PT'): (1771200, 290598),   # SSOPRCQICAPT (supplier selection to testing)
    ('SS', 'AS'): (5083200, 928911),   # Full end-to-end process
    ('OP', 'AS'): (4910400, 924883)    # OPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS (order to after-sales)
}
```

### Key Explanations:
1. **Consecutive Pairs**: Direct step-to-step transitions with durations based on:
   - **Decision phases** (e.g., `SSOP`): Moderate delays (hours-days) with high variability
   - **Physical operations** (e.g., `CAPT`): Predictable durations with low variability
   - **External dependencies** (e.g., `OPRC`): Long lead times with high variability
   - **Automated steps** (e.g., `PTPK`): Short, consistent durations

2. **Non-Consecutive Pairs**: Computed by:
   - **Summing averages** of intermediate consecutive steps
   - **Calculating combined std-dev** via `(² + ² + ...)` assuming independence
   - **Including critical multi-stage relationships** like:
     - Supplier selection to component receipt (`SSRC`)
     - Order placement to after-sales (`OPAS`)
     - Full process duration (`SSAS`)

3. **Time Estimates**:
   - Based on supply chain domain knowledge (e.g., international shipping delays, quality checks)
   - Reflects real-world variability (e.g., `OPRC` std-dev = 3 days for supplier lead times)
   - End-to-end process (`SSAS`) shows high std-dev (10.75 days) due to cumulative uncertainty

This profile models temporal constraints for deviation detection where `|observed_time - avg| > ZETA * std_dev` would flag anomalies.
