This visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that depicts the workflow for shipping goods from a computer hardware shop. The diagram is divided into three lanes: Logistics, Dispatch of Goods (Computer Hardware Shop, Secretary), and Warehouse. Here's a step-by-step description:

1. **Ship Goods (Event)**:

2. **Clarify Shipment Method (Task)**:
