Certainly! Here is a list of 20 relevant questions about the process, along with suggested confidence scores based on the variability and importance of each aspect in the process:

1. **How often does an Employee submit a Declaration without it being processed further?**
   - Confidence Score: 9 (high frequency, but a rare occurrence)

2. **What is the most common path taken from submission to payment handling for Declarations?**
   - Confidence Score: 10 (core process flow)

3. **Why are there multiple rejections and resubmissions in some paths of the process?**
   - Confidence Score: 9 (frequent issues, impact on performance)

4. **How does the approval path through Budget Owner affect overall processing time?**
   - Confidence Score: 8 (significant step but less frequent than other paths)

5. **What is the most common reason for a Declaration to be REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION or SUPERVISOR?**
   - Confidence Score: 9 (frequent rejections, could identify bottlenecks)

6. **How does having multiple levels of approval affect the overall process time compared to single level?**
   - Confidence Score: 8 (compares different paths and their performance)

7. **Why is there a significant difference in performance between paths with and without Budget Owner approval?**
   - Confidence Score: 9 (performance gap, impact on efficiency)

8. **How does the presence of PRE_APPROVER affect the overall process flow compared to direct approval by ADMINISTRATION or SUPERVISOR?**
   - Confidence Score: 7 (intermediate step that may have different impacts)

9. **What is the likelihood of a Declaration being REJECTED multiple times before it reaches Payment Handling?**
   - Confidence Score: 8 (high frequency, but complex paths)

10. **How does missing information affect the process time and final approval rate?**
    - Confidence Score: 7 (specific impact on certain paths)

11. **What is the most effective way to streamline the process for Declarations that require multiple rejections and resubmissions?**
    - Confidence Score: 8 (improvement opportunity, common issue)

12. **How do different approval roles affect the total processing time of a Declaration?**
    - Confidence Score: 9 (direct impact on performance metrics)

13. **What is the average number of times an Employee has to resubmit a Declaration before it gets approved and processed?**
    - Confidence Score: 8 (frequent rejections, but less common than initial submission)

14. **How does having multiple rejections and approvals by different roles impact the overall employee satisfaction?**
    - Confidence Score: 7 (indirect impact on user experience)

15. **What is the most efficient path to payment handling without delays due to rejections or resubmissions?**
    - Confidence Score: 8 (core optimization question)

16. **How does the addition of a PRE_APPROVER role impact the overall processing time and approval rate compared to direct ADMINISTRATION approval?**
    - Confidence Score: 7 (intermediate step with potential benefits)

17. **What is the impact of having multiple final approvals on the performance metrics for Payment Handling?**
    - Confidence Score: 8 (specific path and its performance)

18. **How does the frequency of rejections at different stages affect the overall volume of Declarations processed per day?**
    - Confidence Score: 9 (volume impact, common issue)

19. **What are the main causes for a Declaration to be REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER or SUPERVISOR before reaching final approval?**
    - Confidence Score: 8 (frequent rejections, potential issues that need addressing)

20. **How does the process design influence employee behavior in terms of initial submission accuracy and resubmission frequency?**
    - Confidence Score: 7 (user behavior impact, but less directly tied to performance metrics)

These questions are designed to help identify areas for improvement in the process by focusing on key aspects such as frequency, performance, bottlenecks, and user experience.
