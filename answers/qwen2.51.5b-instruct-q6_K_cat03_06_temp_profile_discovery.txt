To generate a temporal profile for the given process, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the time intervals between each pair of activities in every trace (process variant). We will consider both direct and indirect relationships between activities. 

Here's how you can do it using Python:

1. **Extract pairs**: Identify all unique pairs of activities that occur within a process execution.
2. **Collect times**: Record the timestamps for these pairs across different traces.
3. **Calculate averages and standard deviations**:
   - Average time interval
   - Standard deviation of the time intervals

Let's start by extracting all unique pairs from the given data:

```python
# Extracting all unique pairs (A, B) where A leads to B or vice versa
pairs = set()
for trace in process_variants:
    for i in range(len(trace) - 1):
        pair = tuple(sorted((trace[i], trace[i+1])))
        if pair not in pairs and len(pair) == 2:  # Skip single activity pairs
            pairs.add(pair)

# Now we have all unique pairs, let's calculate the temporal profile
temporal_profile = {}

for pair in pairs:
    count_pairs = {}
    
    for variant in process_variants:
        if tuple(sorted((variant[pair[0]], variant[pair[1]]))) not in count_pairs and len(variant) > 2: 
            count_pairs[tuple(sorted((variant[pair[0]], variant[pair[1]])))] = 1
    avg, stdev = calculate_avg_std(count_pairs)
    temporal_profile[pair] = (avg, stdev)

print(temporal_profile)
```

This script will go through each process variant and for every pair of activities (A and B), it checks if there's a similar activity following in the next step. If so, it counts how many times this occurs and then calculates the average time interval between A and B as well as their standard deviation.

### Function to Calculate Temporal Profile
Hereâ€™s a function to calculate the temporal profile:

```python
def calculate_avg_std(count_pairs):
    total_count = sum(count_pairs.values())
    
    if not count_pairs:
        avg, stdev = 0, 0
    else:
        # Calculating mean and standard deviation
        total_times = sum(times for times in count_pairs.values())
        avg_time = total_times / len(count_pairs)
        std_dev = (sum((time - avg_time) ** 2 for time in count_pairs.values()) / total_count) ** 0.5
        
    return avg_time, stdev

# Now let's calculate the temporal profile using this function
temporal_profile_calculated = {}
for pair in pairs:
    avg, stdev = calculate_avg_std(temporal_profile[pair])
    if (avg, stdev) not in temporal_profile_calculated and (avg, stdev) != (0, 0):
        temporal_profile_calculated[tuple(sorted(pair))] = (avg, stdev)

print("Temporal Profile:")
for pair in pairs:
    print(f"Pair: {pair}, Average Time: {temporal_profile_calculated[pair][0]}, Standard Deviation: {temporal_profile_calculated[pair][1]}")
```

### Summary
After running through the given data and calculating the temporal profile for each unique activity pair, you'll get a dictionary where keys are pairs of activities and values are tuples containing the average time interval and its standard deviation. This gives you insight into how frequently certain sequences occur in the process execution.
