Creating **Temporal Flow for the Process**:

### Creating Fine Notification

- **Time: ** Now
- **Frequency:** Constantly active but not fixed.
- **Performace:** High variability; can vary from 24,459,840 to 66,487,073 (performance of actions within 'Insert Payment')

### Inserting Penalty

- **Time: Creation Fine Notification**
- **Frequency:** Constantly active but not fixed.
- **Performance:** High variability. Can vary from minutes after creation notification message to hours depending on notifications frequency.

### Approvals and Appeals at Prefecture Level
This process is relatively rare, hence the time varies:

- **Time:** Once every N period (N defined dynamically)
  - For example, it typically happens once a month or once half of the monthly cycle

- **Frequency: Not Fixed**
  - Could be hours from one occurrence to next.
  
### Notifications on Appeal
This is frequent and can happen at any time during the notifications loop:

- **Time:** Every notification process can have multiple appeals happening concurrently. This time is dynamic and could occur after hours, or even days in some cases.

Note:
Each of these processes has a distinct 'frequency', not fixed but vary accordingly by nature (creation, appeal to court, receipt of result from appeal, etc).

**Total Performance:** This should cover most possible temporal scenarios, as there are multiple steps where performance variations could be observed.
