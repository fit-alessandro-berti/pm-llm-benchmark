- It’s a process-flow/process-mining map that overlays five object types: VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M), ReturnOrderItem (0.8M), PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M), SalesOrderItem (3.5M), and PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M). Each object type has a color, a Start node, and colormatched paths through the flow.
- Boxes are activities; arrows show the order in which activities typically occur. Labels on arrows (for example, 300ms, 400ms) indicate average/median transition times. Each activity box shows the total number of objects that reached it (Overall).
- Central procurement branch:
  - Purchase requisitions move from Start  Create Requisition  Approve Requisition (5.7M overall).
  - From Approve Requisition the flow splits to Send Order (5.2M), Check Stock (1.0M), Approve Payment (1.5M), and into Process Return (0.8M) for return-related cases.
- Invoicing/payment:
  - Approve Payment feeds Create Invoice (2.0M), which then ends. Returns can also lead into Create Invoice.
- Sales/fulfillment branch (right side):
  - Orders proceed Start  Create Order (8.5M)  Pack Goods (2.0M)  Ship Goods (1.8M)  Confirm Delivery (1.7M)  Close Order (1.7M)  End, with times shown between each step.
- Multiple End nodes indicate different ways cases finish (after Send Order, after Create Invoice, after Close Order, etc.).
- The overlay shows interactions between object types (e.g., colored lines from different Starts converging on shared activities), volumes at each step, and typical delays between steps—effectively combining procuretopay, order fulfillment, returns, and invoicing into one view.
