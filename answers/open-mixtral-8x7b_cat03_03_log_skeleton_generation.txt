Sure, I can generate a Log Skeleton model for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. Here's an example:
```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set([('purchase_order', 'goods_receipt')]),
    'always_before': set([('purchase_order', 'invoice'), ('goods_receipt', 'invoice')]),
    'always_after': set([('purchase_order', 'purchase_approval'), ('purchase_approval', 'purchase_order'),
                         ('goods_receipt', 'quality_inspection'), ('quality_inspection', 'goods_receipt')]),
    'never_together': set([('purchase_approval', 'quality_inspection')]),
    'activ_freq': {'purchase_order': {1}, 'purchase_approval': {1}, 'goods_receipt': {1, 2}, 'quality_inspection': {1}, 'invoice': {1}},
    'directly_follows': set([('purchase_order', 'purchase_approval'), ('purchase_approval', 'purchase_order'),
                             ('purchase_order', 'goods_receipt'), ('goods_receipt', 'quality_inspection'),
                             ('quality_inspection', 'invoice')])
}
```
In this model, the Purchase-to-Pay process consists of the following activities:

* `purchase_order`: creating a purchase order
* `purchase_approval`: approving the purchase order
* `goods_receipt`: receiving the goods
* `quality_inspection`: inspecting the quality of the received goods
* `invoice`: receiving an invoice

The `equivalence` constraint specifies that if a purchase order is created, then it has the same occurrences as the goods receipt.

The `always_before` constraint specifies that if a purchase order is created, then the invoice should have been executed previously, and if the goods are received, then the invoice should have been executed previously.

The `always_after` constraint specifies that if a purchase order is created, then the purchase approval should have been executed previously, and if the purchase approval is executed, then the purchase order should have been executed previously. Additionally, if the goods are received, then the quality inspection should have been executed previously, and if the quality inspection is executed, then the goods receipt should have been executed previously.

The `never_together` constraint specifies that the purchase approval and quality inspection cannot co-exist inside the same case.

The `activ_freq` constraint specifies that the purchase order, purchase approval, and invoice can occur only once, while the goods receipt can occur either once or twice, and the quality inspection can occur only once.

The `directly_follows` constraint specifies that the purchase approval follows the purchase order, the purchase order follows the purchase approval, the goods receipt follows the purchase order, the quality inspection follows the goods receipt, and the invoice follows the quality inspection.
