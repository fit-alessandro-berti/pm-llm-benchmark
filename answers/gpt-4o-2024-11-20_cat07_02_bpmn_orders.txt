The visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** illustrating the workflow of order processing from sales to product delivery. It consists of **four main lanes** (Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse), each representing a department or function. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Sales Lane**
1. **Start Event:** The process begins on "Monday morning."
2. **Check order for completeness:** Decision point to verify the accuracy of the order.
3. **Check if the customer is already in the database:**
   - If the customer doesn't exist, they are added to the database.
4. **Send order details:** Once complete, order details are passed to the production team.
5. **Draft invoice:** The invoice is prepared after sending the product details.

---

### **Production Lane**
1. **Start Event:** The team receives the order details.
2. **Plan production:** Initiation of the manufacturing process.
3. **Material check:**
   - If the material is not faulty, proceed to "Manufacture product."
4. **End Event:** Output is marked as "Product complete," triggering action in the warehouse.

### **Procurement Lane**
1. **Material Compensation Subprocess:**
   - **Order materials:** This subprocess is initiated if materials are insufficient.
   - **Return material:** Faulty material is returned, and the order may cancel.
2. **Check materials:** Validate the material's quality before proceeding.
3. **Order Cancellation:** If materials fail validation, the order is canceled.

### **Warehouse Lane**
1. **Send product:** After production is complete, the product is dispatched.
2. **End Event:** The process concludes with "Product sent."

- **Events and Connections:**
   - Dotted lines represent communication between departments.
   - Solid lines represent sequence flow.
   - Circles with envelope icons denote messaging or notification events.

This visualization effectively maps the interdepartmental workflow for order management.
