Here is a concise DuckDB query that keeps only the events from cases that contain six or fewer total events:

```sql
-- Step 1: find all case_id values that have  6 events
WITH allowed_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)

-- Step 2: return every event that belongs to those cases
SELECT  el.*
FROM    event_log AS el
JOIN    allowed_cases USING (case_id);
```

Explanation  
1. In the `allowed_cases` CTE we group by `case_id` and retain only those whose event count is  6.  
2. We then join that list back to the original `event_log`, which returns all columns (`*`) for every event that belongs to an allowed case.  

Alternative using a window function:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
        el.*,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS cnt
    FROM event_log AS el
) sub
WHERE cnt <= 6;
```

Both versions achieve the required filtering.
