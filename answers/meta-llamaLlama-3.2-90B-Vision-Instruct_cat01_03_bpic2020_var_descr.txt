The process underlying this data appears to be a declaration or expense claim process, where an employee submits a declaration, which then goes through various approval and review stages before being paid. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Declaration Submission**: The process starts with an employee submitting a declaration (expense claim). This is denoted by "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" in the data.
2. **Approval and Review**: The submitted declaration goes through various approval and review stages, which can include:
	* **Administration Approval**: The declaration is reviewed and approved by the administration. This is denoted by "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION" in the data.
	* **Pre-Approval**: Some declarations may require pre-approval by a pre-approver. This is denoted by "Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER" in the data.
	* **Budget Owner Approval**: Some declarations may require approval by a budget owner. This is denoted by "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" in the data.
	* **Supervisor Approval**: The final approval is typically done by a supervisor. This is denoted by "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" in the data.
3. **Rejection and Resubmission**: If a declaration is rejected at any stage, it can be resubmitted by the employee after addressing the issues. This is denoted by "Declaration REJECTED by [ROLE]" and "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" in the data.
4. **Payment**: Once a declaration is finally approved, a payment request is generated, and the payment is handled. This is denoted by "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled" in the data.
5. **Cancellation**: In some cases, a declaration may be cancelled or rejected without payment. This is denoted by "Declaration REJECTED by [ROLE]" without a subsequent payment request in the data.

The data suggests that there are multiple variants of this process, with different approval and review stages, and different outcomes (e.g., payment, rejection, cancellation). The frequency and performance metrics associated with each variant suggest that the process is not always straightforward and may involve multiple iterations and revisions before a declaration is finally approved and paid.
