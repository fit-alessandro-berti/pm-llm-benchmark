# Procure-to-Pay Event Log Analysis

## Standard P2P Process Flow (Reference)

Before identifying anomalies, let's establish the expected sequence:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**  3. **Issue Purchase Order**  4. **Receive Goods**  5. **Vendor Invoice Received**  6. **Match Invoice to PO** (typically 3-way match: PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice)  7. **Release Payment**  8. **Close Case**

## Case-by-Case Analysis

###  Case 1001 - NORMAL
| Sequence | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  Receive Goods  Invoice  Match  Pay  Close | **Correct sequence** |

This case follows the standard P2P process flow with no anomalies.

###  Case 1002 - MULTIPLE SEVERE ANOMALIES

| Anomaly | Activity Sequence | Problem |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| **1. Missing Approval** | Issue PO before Approve PR | PO issued without proper authorization |
| **2. Payment before Goods Receipt** | Release Payment  Receive Goods | Paid for goods not yet received |
| **3. Payment before Matching** | Release Payment  Match Invoice to PO | No verification before payment |
| **4. Late Approval** | Approval occurs AFTER payment | Retroactive approval is a red flag |

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- **Fraud Risk:** Payment released without verification creates opportunity for fictitious vendor schemes
- **Financial Loss:** Paying before receiving goods means no recourse if goods never arrive or are defective
- **Control Bypass:** Retroactive approval suggests someone circumvented authorization controls
- **Audit Failure:** This pattern would be flagged in any SOX compliance audit

###  Case 1003 - MULTIPLE SEVERE ANOMALIES

| Anomaly | Activity Sequence | Problem |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| **1. Payment before Invoice** | Release Payment (Feb 8)  Invoice Received (Feb 9) | Paid without an invoice |
| **2. Payment before Goods** | Release Payment  Receive Goods | Paid before delivery |
| **3. Payment before Matching** | Release Payment  Match Invoice to PO | No 3-way match performed |

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- **No Documentation:** Paying without an invoice means no legal document supporting the payment
- **Prepayment Risk:** Unless this is a legitimate advance payment (which should be a separate activity), this violates standard controls
- **Verification Failure:** The 3-way match exists specifically to prevent paying for undelivered/incorrect goods
- **Recovery Difficulty:** If goods are wrong or never delivered, recovering funds is extremely difficult

###  Case 1004 - PROCESS SEQUENCE ANOMALY

| Anomaly | Activity Sequence | Problem |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| **Goods Received before PO** | Receive Goods (Feb 6, 09:00)  Issue PO (Feb 6, 09:15) | Goods accepted without valid order |

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- **Maverick Buying:** This suggests goods were ordered outside the formal procurement process
- **Commitment Without Authorization:** The organization became obligated to pay without proper PO
- **Vendor Leverage:** Without a PO, the vendor could dispute terms, pricing, or quantities
- **Inventory Control Issues:** Receiving systems typically require a PO for proper goods receipt
- **Retroactive PO:** Creating a PO after receipt is often done to "fix" records, masking process violations

## Summary of Anomalies

| Case | Severity | Key Issues |
|------|----------|------------|
| 1001 |  Normal | None |
| 1002 |  Critical | Unauthorized PO, payment before receipt/matching, retroactive approval |
| 1003 |  Critical | Payment before invoice, goods, and matching |
| 1004 |  High | Goods received before PO issued |

## Recommendations

1. **Implement system controls** preventing PO creation without approved requisition
2. **Block payments** until 3-way match is completed
3. **Flag retroactive approvals** for management review
4. **Require PO reference** for goods receipt transactions
5. **Monitor for these patterns** using process mining tools for ongoing compliance
