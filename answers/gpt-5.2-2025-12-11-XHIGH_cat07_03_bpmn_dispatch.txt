The visualization is a **BPMN-style process diagram** showing how a **computer hardware shop dispatches goods**, organized into **three swimlanes (roles/departments)**:

- **Logistics**
- **Computer hardware shop – Secretary (dispatch of goods)**
- **Warehouse**

### Main flow (start to end)
1. **Start event: “Ship goods”**  
   A **parallel split (AND gateway)** starts two activities at the same time:
   - In the **Secretary** lane: **Clarify shipment method**
   - In the **Warehouse** lane: **Package goods**

2. **Decision: “Special handling?” (XOR gateway)**
   - **Yes:**  
     **Get 3 offers from logistic companies  Select logistic company and place order**
   - **No:**  
     **Check if insurance is required** (uses **Customer information** data store; “Order details” is shown as a referenced document)

3. **Insurance + labeling (inclusive logic)**
   After checking insurance, an **inclusive gateway** indicates:
   - **If insurance is necessary:** perform **“Insure parcel”** (in **Logistics**)
   - **Always:** **Write package label**
   These paths **merge** afterward.

4. The “special handling” branch and the “insurance/label” branch **rejoin** and then proceed downward to synchronize with the warehouse work.

### Warehouse timing/exception
- **“Package goods”** has a **boundary timer (48 hours)**:
  - If packaging exceeds 48 hours, the process triggers **“Notify customer about delay”**, then rejoins the normal flow.

### Finalization
5. A **parallel join (AND gateway)** waits until:
   - packaging is complete (and any delay notification handled), and
   - shipping method/logistics steps are complete

6. Then:
   - **Fill out shipment paperwork**
   - **Move package to pickup area**
   - **End event: “Shipment prepared”**

Overall, it depicts responsibilities, decisions (special handling, insurance), parallel work (packaging vs. shipment planning), and a time-based escalation (delay notification).
