When comparing the treatment processes between the 'protected group' and the 'unprotected group', several key observations can be made regarding the differences. In the context of process fairness, potential disparities include variations in **performance times, frequencies**, and the **outcomes** at different stages of the treatment processes.

Here’s a breakdown of the main differences:

### 1. **Frequency of Treatment Loops**
   - In both groups, there are several cases where treatments are *unsuccessful*, forcing patients to go through extra diagnosis and repeat treatments:
     - **Unprotected Group**: These repeat loops are more frequent and occur faster. For example, there are sequences where treatment is unsuccessful and patients go through repeated diagnosis and treatment variations (e.g., loops with "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment"):
       - Frequency: 225, 190, 102, etc., in the unprotected group for multiple unsuccessful treatments.
       - More complex loops of treatment, where it fails more than twice, e.g., loops of unsuccessful treatment repeated *three* times, exist in the unprotected group with higher frequency.
     - **Protected Group**: The protected group experiences repetitions due to unsuccessful treatment, but the frequency is much lower (example: frequency 48, 40, 20).
     
   **Interpretation**: The unprotected group seems to go through more repetitions involving unsuccessful treatments, but these variants occur much less frequently in the protected group. This could indicate either a worse health outcome in the unprotected group (requiring more retries) or a potential bias in treatment allocation.

### 2. **Performance (Treatment Speed for Complex Cases)**
   - **Unprotected Group**: 
     - The performance of loops involving multiple treatment failures and repeated diagnosis is much faster despite their complexity. For example:
       - Unprotected group performance: 639972.457 (3 loops) for highly complex sequences involving multiple failures, and even faster for less complex sequences (420013.686 for 2 loops).
     - **Protected Group**: 
       - The analogous treatment loop in the protected group shows comparable complexity but tends to have slower performance values — for example:
         - Performance for a similar case of 2 loops in the protected group: 480019.789 or 420029.896.

   **Interpretation**: For cases involving multiple treatment failures and retries, the unprotected group experiences a somewhat **faster throughput** (compared to the protected group), especially in complex cases. This differential treatment speed could suggest resource imbalances or prioritization differences within the process.

### 3. **Direct Discharge Without Treatment**
   - **Unprotected Group**: 
     - 505 patients are discharged directly without going through any form of diagnosis or treatment. This may represent cases where patients are triaged and do not require treatment, or it could encompass cases where patients are not given care for other reasons (e.g., refusal of care, administrative discharge).
   - **Protected Group**: 
     - There do not appear to be cases where patients are directly discharged without at least registering or going through some form of diagnosis or treatment.

   **Interpretation**: The unprotected group has a much higher occurrence of direct discharge without receiving medical intervention. This could indicate behavioral patterns of the group (e.g., opting out of treatment), different administrative practices, or worse, a form of systemic neglect.

### 4. **Use of 'Thorough Examination' and 'Expert Examination'**
   - **Unprotected Group**: 
     - In the unprotected group, sequences involving thorough examination (e.g., “Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis...”) are executed much more frequently (e.g., Frequency 1466 and 1418) than in the protected group.
     - Thorough examination in the unprotected group is associated with consistently longer runtime (e.g., around 320004.432) and is more common.
   - **Protected Group**: 
     - In the protected group, though similar process variations do occur, the frequency is much lower (e.g., Frequency 73 and 78).

   **Interpretation**: There seems to be a significant difference in the access to or use of **expert assessments** and **thorough examinations** between the two groups. The unprotected group has more frequent and faster access to these complex examinations, suggesting they may receive more thorough medical attention or more in-depth scrutiny in their diagnostics.

### 5. **Discharge Timelines for Successful Treatment**
   - **Performance Comparison**:
     - The unprotected group has performance times in the "Register -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Treatment Successful -> Discharge" variants around **320000 ms**.
     - Similarly, the protected group takes about **320020 ms**. However, related unprotected-group variants appear slightly faster.

   **Interpretation**: While the treatment time for successful treatments is similar between the two groups, the unprotected group typically receives more frequent and slightly faster thorough examinations or treatments, which may either reflect prioritization, access to better resources, or higher scrutiny.

### 6. **Simpler Treatment Variants**
   - **Unprotected Group**: 
     - The unprotected group does not have many cases where treatment is ended prematurely without a resolution. For example, there are few cases reported where a patient is discharged following treatment without it being explicitly marked as successful or unsuccessful.
     - **Protected Group**: 
       - The protected group does have such cases (e.g., “Register at ER -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Discharge” with frequency 24).

   **Interpretation**: Patients in the unprotected group tend to stay in the process longer until a clear resolution is achieved (either treatment success or failure), while several patients in the protected group seem to be discharged earlier without a clear treatment result.

### Conclusion:
- **Key Differences**:
  - Higher **frequency** of complex treatments and retries in the **unprotected group**, alongside faster performance in these cases.
  - Disparities in **examination type access** (e.g., more thorough or expert evaluations for the unprotected group).
  - **Simpler cases** (e.g., discharge without treatment or shorter sequences) are slightly more common in the protected group.
  
Overall, the **unprotected group** tends to receive more **complex, thorough, and faster-treated care** but also faces more **treatment failures**. On the other hand, the **protected group** experiences **fewer treatment retries**, but the performance and access to thorough examinations are slower or less frequent. These distinctions raise questions about whether the protected group is receiving comparably thorough care and whether disparities in treatment failures indicate deeper systemic issues.
