Analyzing the provided process variants, frequencies, and performance metrics, we can identify potential root causes for performance issues in the process. Here are some process and data-specific considerations:

1. **Looping and Rejection**: Many variants involve looping, where a declaration is rejected, and the employee resubmits it. This is evident in variants like `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE...`. The high frequency and poor performance of these variants suggest that the rejection and resubmission process is inefficient and time-consuming.
2. **Multiple Approval Steps**: Variants with multiple approval steps (e.g., `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`) tend to have lower frequencies and higher performance metrics. This may indicate that the approval process is a bottleneck, and reducing the number of approval steps or improving the efficiency of each step could enhance performance.
3. **Pre-Approval and Budget Owner Involvement**: Variants involving pre-approval and budget owner involvement (e.g., `Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`) often have lower frequencies and worse performance metrics. This might suggest that these steps are unnecessary or can be optimized to reduce delays.
4. **Missing or Incomplete Declarations**: Variants like `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING` indicate that declarations are being rejected due to missing or incomplete information. This could be a root cause of performance issues, as it leads to rework and delays.
5. **Administration and Supervisor Roles**: The `ADMINISTRATION` and `SUPERVISOR` roles appear frequently in the variants, often with rejection or approval decisions. The performance metrics for these roles are often higher than those for other roles, suggesting that these steps may be contributing to delays.
6. **Employee Involvement**: Variants with multiple employee involvements (e.g., `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) tend to have lower frequencies and worse performance metrics. This might indicate that employees are not being empowered to submit complete or accurate declarations, leading to rework and delays.
7. **Payment Handling**: The `Payment Handled` step appears in many variants, often with relatively low frequencies and high performance metrics. This could suggest that the payment handling process is a bottleneck or that there are issues with the payment processing system.

To address these potential root causes, consider the following:

1. **Simplify the approval process**: Reduce the number of approval steps or implement parallel approvals to minimize delays.
2. **Implement a pre-submission review**: Ensure that employees can review and validate their declarations before submission to reduce rejections and resubmissions.
3. **Streamline the rejection and resubmission process**: Automate or optimize the rejection and resubmission process to minimize delays and reduce the number of loops.
4. **Provide clear guidelines and training**: Ensure that employees understand the declaration submission process and requirements to reduce errors and rejections.
5. **Analyze and optimize the payment handling process**: Identify bottlenecks or issues in the payment handling process and implement improvements to reduce delays and enhance performance.
6. **Monitor and adjust role-based performance**: Analyze the performance metrics for each role and adjust processes or provide training to improve efficiency and reduce delays.
7. **Implement data validation and completeness checks**: Ensure that declarations are complete and accurate before they are submitted to reduce rejections and delays.

By addressing these process and data-specific considerations, you can potentially improve the performance of the declaration submission and payment handling process.
