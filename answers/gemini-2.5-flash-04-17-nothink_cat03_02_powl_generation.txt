# Exclusive choice between CD, MD, or skipping (although the prompt implies one must be chosen)
# For simplicity and adhering to the described structure, we'll model the choice between CD and MD directly.
# If skipping was possible, we'd include skip_deploy as a child.

# 5. Concurrent Quality Assurance and Security Audit
qa = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
sa = Transition(label="Security Audit")

# 6. Final Go-Live Approval

# Construct the overall POWL model using a root StrictPartialOrder
# The nodes of the root are the main sequential phases/components

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[phase1, phase2, config_loop, deployment_choice, phase5, gla])

# Define the ordering between the main phases

# Phase 2 starts after Phase 1 completes
root.order.add_edge(phase1, phase2)

# Configuration loop starts after Phase 2 completes
root.order.add_edge(phase2, config_loop)

# Deployment choice starts after the configuration loop completes
root.order.add_edge(config_loop, deployment_choice)

# Phase 5 (QA and SA) starts after the deployment choice completes
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, phase5)

# Go-Live Approval starts after Phase 5 completes

# The 'root' object now represents the entire POWL model for the complex scenario.
# You can now use this 'root' object with pm4py functions for visualization, simulation, etc.
# For example, to print the structure (conceptual):
# print(root)
