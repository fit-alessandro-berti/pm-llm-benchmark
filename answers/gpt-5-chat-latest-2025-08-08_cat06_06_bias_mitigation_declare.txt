Alright — let's embed constraints in your **DECLARE** model that actively mitigate the risk of bias given the sensitive attribute context you described.

## **Updated DECLARE Model with Fairness Constraints**
```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # Ensure manual review is always present when sensitive applicants are processed
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # Ensure bias mitigation check is present
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {

        # If a minority applicant is approved, ManualReview must occur in the trace
        "Approve_Minority": {
            "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}

        # If a minority applicant is rejected, ManualReview must occur in the trace
        "Reject_Minority": {

            "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        # After checking applicant race, a bias mitigation check must happen before any decision
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {

    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {
        # Directly after BiasMitigationCheck we may have the decision
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {
            "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "chainprecedence": {},

    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {

        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        # Also prevent immediate rejection after check without bias mitigation
        "CheckApplicantRace": {

        }

## **Rationale for Added Constraints**

1. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`**
   - Guarantee that these fairness checks occur in every trace — ensuring decisions for sensitive applicants always involve additional scrutiny.

2. **Coexistence Between Decision Outcomes and `ManualReview` for Sensitive Applicants**
   - Enforces that any *approve* or *reject* outcome involving a minority applicant **must** be accompanied by a manual review.  
   - This prevents silent, automated decision-making that could be biased.

3. **Response from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`**
   - Forces a fairness validation activity (`BiasMitigationCheck`) before a decision is made, ensuring decision-making logic doesn't flow directly from sensitive data to outcome.

4. **Nonsuccession from `CheckApplicantRace` to Decisions**
   - Blocks the direct path from checking race to making a decision (Approve/Reject or Reject_Minority) without intervening fairness steps.

5. **Chainresponse Linking `BiasMitigationCheck` to `FinalDecision`**
   - Strengthens the sequence: once fairness is checked, the decision follows immediately, avoiding delays that might introduce skipped checks.

 **Effect on Bias Reduction:**  
By enforcing parallel existence checks, blocking unsafe sequences, and mandating fairness checkpoints (manual review & bias mitigation check), this model significantly limits the possibilities for immediate, unchecked biased decision-making in the loan application process.

If you’d like, I can **also generate a visual constraint graph** showing the original and fairness-augmented relationships so you can better see how these anti-bias rules shape the process. Would you like me to create that diagram?
