You can use window functions to look at the next two events within each case and flag the start of the pattern. Once you have the case_ids to exclude, filter them out in the outer query:

```sql
WITH seq_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            "timestamp",
            lead(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS next_act1,
            lead(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS next_act2,
            lead("timestamp", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS ts1,
            lead("timestamp", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS ts2
        FROM event_log
    ) t
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_act1 = 'Create Order'
      AND next_act2 = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (ts2 - ts1) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM seq_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, "timestamp";
```

This identifies cases where the three activities occur in direct succession and the gap between the `Create Order` and `Confirm Order` events in that sequence is more than 5 days, and then returns only events from cases that do not meet both criteria.
