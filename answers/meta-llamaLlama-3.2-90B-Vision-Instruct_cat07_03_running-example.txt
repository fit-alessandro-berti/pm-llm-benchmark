The image depicts a flowchart illustrating the process of handling requests, from initial registration to final resolution. The flowchart is divided into several stages, each represented by a distinct symbol and connected by arrows that indicate the direction of the process.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Start:** The flowchart begins with a circular symbol labeled "Start," indicating the initiation of the request-handling process.
*   **Register Request:** The first stage involves registering the request, denoted by a rectangle with rounded corners and a plus sign inside. This stage is followed by an examination, which may be thorough or casual, depending on the specific circumstances.
*   **Examine Thoroughly/Casually:** The examination process is represented by two separate diamonds, one for thorough examination and another for casual examination. The outcome of the examination determines the next step in the process.
*   **Check Ticket:** If the examination reveals that the request is valid, the ticket is checked, and the process proceeds to the next stage.
*   **Decide:** The decision stage is represented by a rectangle with a plus sign inside, indicating that a determination is made regarding the request.
*   **Reject Request:** If the request is rejected, the process terminates, and the request is not further processed.
*   **Reinitiate Request:** In some cases, the request may be reinitiated, allowing the process to restart from the beginning.
*   **Compensation:** If the request is approved, compensation may be provided to the individual or entity making the request.
*   **Pay:** The final stage involves paying out the compensation, marking the completion of the request-handling process.
*   **End:** The flowchart concludes with a circular symbol labeled "End," indicating the termination of the process.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the flowchart illustrates a structured approach to handling requests, from initial registration to final resolution. The process involves examination, decision-making, and potential compensation, with clear guidelines for each stage. By following this flowchart, individuals and entities can ensure that requests are handled efficiently and effectively.
