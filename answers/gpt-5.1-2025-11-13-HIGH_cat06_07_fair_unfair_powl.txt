Below are two concrete POWL models (in pm4py-style Python) that implement the described process.  
Both have the same basic structure (application  completeness loop  skill test  cultural step  managerial review  final decision), but they differ in how the cultural/affiliation stage is modeled.

---

## 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness (XOR with Community Affiliation)

Here, after `SkillAssessment` there is an XOR:  
- Either a standard `CulturalFitCheck`,  
- Or a `CommunityAffiliationCheck` path that implicitly gives an advantage to certain applicants.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# --- Activities ---
receive = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")

# Loop components: A = parse/check; B = request more info
parse_check = Transition(label="ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

skill = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# Cultural fit / affiliation (potential bias)
cultural_standard = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affil = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # biased branch

managerial = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# --- Loop for data completeness ---
# Execute parse_check; if incomplete, do request_info then parse_check again.
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[parse_check, request_info]
)

# --- XOR for cultural vs community-affiliation path (source of unfairness) ---
cultural_or_affil = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[cultural_standard, community_affil]
)

# --- Overall partially ordered workflow ---
unfair_root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[receive, data_completeness_loop, skill, cultural_or_affil, managerial, final_decision]
)

# Sequential order of stages
unfair_root.order.add_edge(receive, data_completeness_loop)
unfair_root.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, skill)
unfair_root.order.add_edge(skill, cultural_or_affil)
unfair_root.order.add_edge(cultural_or_affil, managerial)
unfair_root.order.add_edge(managerial, final_decision)
```

The unfairness can arise because the XOR allows some applicants to follow the `CommunityAffiliationCheck` path, where affiliation/local-residency cues influence the evaluation differently than the standard `CulturalFitCheck`.

---

## 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness (Single Cultural Fit Path for All)

In this model, everyone goes through the same `CulturalFitCheck`.  
There is no community-based XOR branch giving a selective advantage.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# --- Activities ---
receive_f = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")

# Loop components: A = parse/check; B = request more info
parse_check_f = Transition(label="ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck")
request_info_f = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

skill_f = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# Single, uniform cultural fit check (no affiliation-based branch)
cultural_fit_f = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

managerial_f = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision_f = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# --- Loop for data completeness ---
data_completeness_loop_f = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[parse_check_f, request_info_f]
)

# --- Overall partially ordered workflow (no XOR at cultural stage) ---
fair_root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[receive_f, data_completeness_loop_f, skill_f, cultural_fit_f, managerial_f, final_decision_f]
)

# Sequential order of the stages
fair_root.order.add_edge(receive_f, data_completeness_loop_f)
fair_root.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop_f, skill_f)
fair_root.order.add_edge(skill_f, cultural_fit_f)
fair_root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_f, managerial_f)
fair_root.order.add_edge(managerial_f, final_decision_f)
```

Here, the potential source of bias introduced by an affiliation-based XOR branch has been removed; all applicants experience the same cultural evaluation step.
