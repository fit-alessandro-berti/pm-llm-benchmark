Based on the constraints and activities provided, I'll try to infer the underlying process. Please note that there might be some assumptions made due to the complexity of the data.

The process appears to be related to a declaration process in an organization, possibly involving employee declarations, payment handling, and supervisor approvals. Here's a possible workflow:

1. **Declaration Submission**: An employee submits a declaration (represented by "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE") to the organization.
2. **Pre-Approval**: The declaration is sent for pre-approval to either an administrator ("Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION") or a supervisor ("Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR"). If approved, it will be moved to the next stage.
3. **Final Approval**: A supervisor approves the declaration (represented by "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR").
4. **Payment Request**: After final approval, a payment request is generated (represented by "Request Payment").
5. **Payment Handling**: The organization processes the payment request, resulting in either a successful payment ("Payment Handled") or rejection.
6. **Alternative Scenarios**: There are alternative paths in case of rejection or non-payment:
	* Rejected declaration: The declaration is rejected at any stage, and the process might loop back to step 2 (pre-approval) or terminate due to absence of further steps.

From the constraints and activities provided, I've identified the following relationships:

* **Responded Existence**: Certain events are triggered by others; for example, "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" is triggered by "Request Payment".
* **Co-Existence**: Some events can occur simultaneously; e.g., "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled" might happen at the same time.
* **Precedence**: Certain events must occur before others; for instance, "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" must occur before "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR".
* **Response**: Events have a causal relationship; e.g., "Request Payment" triggers "Payment Handled".

The process seems to involve several stakeholders, including employees (submitting declarations), administrators (processing submissions), and supervisors (approving declarations). The organization is responsible for handling payments based on the approved declarations.

Please note that this interpretation might not cover all possible scenarios or edge cases. If you'd like me to refine my understanding or explore specific aspects of the process further, feel free to provide additional context or clarify any points!
