We need to produce Python code constructing the Petri net. Use pm4py library. Provide places and transitions, arcs, initial and final marking. Should include loops between DV and RDS, FC and II. Also include optional approval step if amount > threshold; but we can model as a transition that may or may not be taken? We can just have a transition AP that is optional: maybe use two branches: one path goes through AP, another bypasses it? But scenario says "must be approved by senior manager if amount surpasses threshold". So we could model as a decision place after CA where token goes to either AP or directly to P depending on condition. But for simplicity we can just include AP always; it's fine.

We need to provide code snippet.

Also mention removal of sink place? Not necessary.

Let's design:

Places:


- start
- after_CR
- after_DV
- after_RDS (maybe same as after_DV)
But better: Place between DV and RDS loop: place "doc_verification" before DV transition; then RDS leads back to doc_verification.
Similarly for FC/II loop: place "fraud_check" before FC; II leads back to fraud_check.

After CA -> maybe place "assessment_done".

Then optionally go through AP -> payment -> notification -> closure.

Define transitions:


- t_CR
- t_DV
- t_RDS
- t_FC
- t_II
- t_CA
- t_AP (optional)
- t_Payment (t_P)
- t_Notification (t_N)
- t_Closure (t_CL)
Arcs:
start -> CR.
CR -> after_CR.
after_CR -> DV.
DV -> doc_verification? Actually we need a place before DV: let's call p_doc_verif_start. So start->CR->p_doc_start->DV->p_doc_end. Then from p_doc_end we go either to next step or back via RDS. Let's design:

Place p1 = 'after_CR'
Place p2 = 'doc_verif'
Place p3 = 'after_DV'  # ready for next step

Transition DV consumes from p2, produces into p3.
Transition RDS consumes from p3, produces into p2 (loop).

Similarly for fraud check:

Place p4 = 'fraud_check_start'
Place p5 = 'after_FC'

Transition FC consumes from p4 produce into p5.
Transition II consumes from p5 produce into p4.

After that go to CA:

Place after_CA

Transitions accordingly.

Then optional approval:

Place pre_AP

If amount > threshold then token goes through AP else skip? For simplicity just add both branches using places with AND-split/merge? Could use two places: one branch with AP, other without but both converge at payment. Use an OR-split by having two arcs from pre_AP to both AP transition and directly to payment transition with guard conditions omitted in Petri net representation but conceptually there is choice.

Simplify: After CA produce token in pre_AP_place which has two outgoing arcs: one arc leads via AP transition then payment; another arc leads directly via payment transition skipping approval. approval path but still includes possibility of going through approval if needed.

Thus define transitions:
t_AP labeled "Approval"
t_Payment labeled "Payment"

Arcs:
pre_AP_place --(AP)--> post_AP_place --(Payment)--> ...
pre_AP_place --(Payment)--> ...  # direct path

But easier: create two places post_CA1 and post_CA2 representing the two branches merging at Payment stage using an AND-split/merge? Actually OR-split would be represented by having multiple outgoing arcs from same place leading to different transitions; that's fine because Petri nets allow nondeterministic choice based on tokens distribution - but here only one token so it will nondeterministically choose one branch unless there are conditions encoded elsewhere like inhibitor arcs etc., which pm4py might not support easily. But it's okay for demonstration purposes.

Thus implement as described above with simple structure ignoring conditional gating details beyond loops.

Now write code accordingly using pm4py objects:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

Create net = PetriNet(name="Insurance Claim Process")

Define places list of names mapping new Place objects etc., add them all etc., define transitions similarly adding them all etc., connect arcs using petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source,target,net). For loops use appropriate connections backwards accordingly.

Set initial marking im[place_start] = 1

Set final marking fm[place_closure] = 1

Return net im fm maybe print something?

Also mention removal of sink not needed here but could show example removal if desired?

Let's craft code snippet accordingly with proper formatting per guidelines including LaTeX usage only for math expressions - none needed except maybe variable names no math required so no LaTeX needed except perhaps referencing tokens count like \(1\). But not necessary because no math expression present in text aside from numbers maybe not required inside parentheses due formatting rule requiring escaped parentheses around inline math content only when used - we don't have any such content so fine.

Make sure code block uses python language extension . Provide comments explaining each part briefly within code comments (#). Ensure print width 80 characters - Prettier ensures line length <=80 automatically though our lines may exceed slightly but okay within typical guidelines; keep lines short <80 char each line ideally by splitting long lines across multiple lines or using parentheses across lines e.g.:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(place_a,
trans_b,
net)

Will keep under 80 char likely yes ~70 char each line good enough.

Let's craft final answer now.

Below is a complete Python script that builds the **accepting Petri net** described in the scenario.
It uses `pm4py`’s `PetriNet`, `Marking` and helper functions (`petri_utils`) exactly as requested.

```

The script creates an **accepting** (`initial_marking` → `final_marking`) **Petri net** that captures all sequential steps plus possible re‑submission of documents (`RDS`) and repeated investigations (`II`). The optional approval step is represented by an OR–split at `pre_ap`: a token can either go straight to payment or first pass through the `AP` transition before reaching payment again—this models “approved only when necessary”.

Feel free to adapt labels or add guard conditions later if you want more precise control over when each branch is taken!
