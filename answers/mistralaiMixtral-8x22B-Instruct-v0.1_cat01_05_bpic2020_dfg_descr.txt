 Based on the provided data, this process describes a travel and expense declaration and reimbursement process in an organization. The process involves several roles (Employee, Pre-approver, Administration, Budget Owner, Supervisor, Missing, and Payment Handled) and various declaration statuses (Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Final Approved, For Approval, and Saved). Here's a brief description of the process:

1. An employee submits a travel and expense declaration, which can be saved as a draft.

2. After submission, the declaration can be approved by various roles, depending on the specific scenario:
   a. Pre-approver: In this case, the declaration goes for approval to the supervisor.
   b. Administration: The declaration can be sent to the budget owner for approval or directly to the supervisor for final approval.
   c. Budget Owner: The budget owner can either approve the declaration, sending it to the supervisor for final approval, or reject it, sending it back to the employee.
   d. Supervisor: The supervisor provides the final approval for the declaration, which then moves forward to the payment handling process.

3. A declaration can be rejected at various stages:
   a. Employee: The employee can reject and re-submit the declaration.
   b. Pre-approver: Rejected declarations are sent back to the employee.
   c. Administration: Rejected declarations are sent back to the employee.
   d. Budget Owner: Rejected declarations are sent back to the employee.
   e. Supervisor: Rejected declarations are sent back to the employee or, in certain scenarios, to a "Missing" entity, possibly indicating an undefined or unknown process step.
   f. Missing: A declaration can be rejected, but the data does not indicate who is responsible for this action.

4. After approval, the organization initiates the payment handling process, at the end of which the payment is presumably made. There is also a possibility for a declaration to be rejected during or after the payment handling process, in which case it is sent back to the employee.
