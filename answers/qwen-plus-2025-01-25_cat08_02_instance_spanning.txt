### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

#### **Formal Identification of Constraints**
To identify and quantify the impact of each instance-spanning constraint, we can leverage process mining techniques such as resource analysis, bottleneck detection, and dependency modeling. Here's how:

- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:**
  - Use **resource utilization analysis** to track the usage patterns of cold-packing stations (e.g., Station C1, C2, etc.) across all orders.
  - Calculate **waiting time** for orders requiring cold-packing by comparing the timestamp when an order is ready for packing with the timestamp it actually starts at a cold-packing station.
  - Identify **contention periods** where multiple orders compete for the limited number of cold-packing stations.

- **Shipping Batches:**
  - Analyze the event log to detect when orders are grouped into batches based on destination regions.
  - Measure the **batch formation delay**—the time between when an order completes its previous step (e.g., Quality Check) and when it begins Shipping Label Generation.
  - Assess the **impact on throughput** by comparing batched orders' end-to-end processing times against non-batched orders.

- **Priority Handling for Express Orders:**
  - Track interruptions caused by express orders preempting standard orders at shared resources (e.g., packing stations or QC staff).
  - Quantify the **additional waiting time** incurred by standard orders due to these interruptions.
  - Evaluate the frequency and duration of preemptions using activity logs.

- **Hazardous Material Limits:**
  - Monitor the simultaneous processing of hazardous material orders during Packing and Quality Check phases.
  - Identify instances where the limit of 10 orders is reached, causing delays for subsequent hazardous orders.
  - Compute the **delay contribution** from this regulatory constraint.

#### **Metrics for Measuring Impact**
- **Resource Contention Metrics:** Average waiting time per order, maximum queue length for shared resources, and resource utilization rates.
- **Batching Metrics:** Batch formation time, average batch size, and percentage of orders delayed due to batching.
- **Priority Handling Metrics:** Frequency of preemptions, total waiting time added to standard orders, and percentage of express orders expedited successfully.
- **Hazardous Material Metrics:** Number of times the limit was hit, average delay per hazardous order, and compliance rate.

#### **Differentiating Between-Instance vs. Within-Instance Delays**
- Use **case-level analysis** to isolate delays caused by external factors (e.g., resource contention, batching) versus internal factors (e.g., long activity durations).
- Compare the timestamps of activities within a single case to those of other overlapping cases sharing the same resources or constraints.
- Apply **trace alignment techniques** to decompose total delays into components attributable to specific constraints.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

#### **Potential Interactions**
- **Cold-Packing and Priority Handling:** An express order requiring cold-packing may preempt a standard order already using a cold-packing station, increasing the queue length for that resource.
- **Batching and Hazardous Materials:** If multiple hazardous orders are destined for the same region, forming a batch could exacerbate delays due to the simultaneous processing limit.
- **Resource Contention and Batching:** Limited packing stations might slow down the completion of individual orders, delaying the formation of shipping batches.

#### **Importance of Understanding Interactions**
Understanding these interactions is critical because optimizing one constraint in isolation may inadvertently worsen others. For example:
- Prioritizing express orders without considering cold-packing availability could lead to prolonged queues for standard orders needing cold-packing.
- Ignoring hazardous material limits while forming large batches might result in non-compliance or excessive delays.

By modeling these interactions explicitly, we can develop holistic optimization strategies that balance competing demands and minimize overall delays.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Shared Stations**
- **Primary Constraint Addressed:** Shared Cold-Packing Stations
- **Proposed Changes:** Implement a dynamic scheduling algorithm that prioritizes resource allocation based on urgency (express orders), type of order (cold-packing vs. standard), and predicted demand.
- **Data Leverage:** Use historical data to predict peak demand periods for cold-packing and adjust staffing levels accordingly.
- **Expected Outcome:** Reduced waiting times for cold-packing orders and improved utilization of specialized stations.

#### **Strategy 2: Adaptive Batching Logic**
- **Primary Constraint Addressed:** Shipping Batches
- **Proposed Changes:** Introduce dynamic batch formation triggers based on real-time order flow and regional distribution patterns. For example:
  - Form smaller batches during high-demand periods to reduce wait times.
  - Prioritize express orders in batches regardless of their destination region.
- **Data Leverage:** Analyze past batch performance to determine optimal batch sizes and timing thresholds.
- **Expected Outcome:** Faster batch formation and reduced delays for individual orders.

#### **Strategy 3: Integrated Scheduling Rules**
- **Primary Constraint Addressed:** Priority Handling and Hazardous Material Limits
- **Proposed Changes:** Develop a unified scheduling policy that considers both priority handling and regulatory limits:
  - Allocate hazardous orders to separate shifts or dedicated resources whenever possible.
  - Preempt standard orders only if the resulting delay does not exceed a predefined threshold.
- **Data Leverage:** Simulate different scheduling scenarios using historical data to find the best balance between priority fulfillment and compliance.
- **Expected Outcome:** Improved adherence to hazardous material limits while minimizing disruptions to standard orders.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

#### **Simulation Techniques**
- Build discrete-event simulation models to replicate the fulfillment center's operations under current conditions and proposed optimizations.
- Incorporate all identified constraints and their interactions to ensure realism.

#### **Focus Areas in Simulation Models**
- **Resource Contention:** Accurately model the behavior of shared resources (e.g., cold-packing stations) and measure their impact on waiting times.
- **Batching Dynamics:** Test various batch formation rules and evaluate their effects on throughput and delivery times.
- **Priority Interruptions:** Simulate the behavior of express orders and assess their influence on standard order delays.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure that hazardous material limits are respected and analyze their implications for process flow.

#### **Validation Process**
- Compare simulated KPIs (e.g., end-to-end processing time, resource utilization, compliance rates) against actual values from the event log.
- Iteratively refine the models until they accurately reflect observed behaviors.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

#### **Key Metrics and Dashboards**
- **Resource Utilization Dashboard:** Monitor the usage rates and queue lengths for shared resources like cold-packing stations.
- **Batch Performance Dashboard:** Track batch formation times, batch sizes, and their impact on individual order delays.
- **Priority Handling Dashboard:** Display the frequency and duration of preemptions, along with the percentage of express orders expedited successfully.
- **Hazardous Material Compliance Dashboard:** Show the number of times the limit was hit and the associated delays.

#### **Tracking Effectiveness**
- Continuously monitor the metrics listed above to ensure that the implemented strategies are achieving their intended outcomes.
- Use process mining tools to detect any emerging bottlenecks or new dependencies that may arise after changes.
- Regularly update dashboards with fresh data to maintain visibility into the evolving process dynamics.

By systematically addressing instance-spanning constraints through data-driven analysis, targeted optimizations, and rigorous validation, the fulfillment center can significantly improve its operational efficiency and meet delivery deadlines more reliably.
