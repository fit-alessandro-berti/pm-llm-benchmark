The process described by this data appears to be a multi-step approval process for some type of request or declaration. Here's a simplified description:

1. An employee submits a declaration.
2. The declaration can then go through several approval paths:
   - It can be approved by a pre-approver.
   - It can be approved by an administration.
   - If approved by the administration, it can be further approved by a budget owner.
   - If approved by the pre-approver or the budget owner, it can then be finally approved by a supervisor.
3. If the declaration is approved by the supervisor, a request for payment can be made.
4. Once the request for payment is made, it can be handled.
5. At any point in the process, a declaration or request can be rejected. If rejected, it goes back to the previous step, usually for the employee to resubmit the declaration.
6. There are also some infrequent transitions, such as a saved declaration leading to a request for payment, or a rejected declaration leading directly to a request for payment.
7. The process can also end in a "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" state, and there's a transition from "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" to this state.

The frequencies and performances seem to indicate the number of times a transition occurred and the average time it took for that transition to happen, respectively.
