Here is a process tree (in operator notation) that models the entire described hospital process in a single tree:

```text
->(
  'A',
  ->(
    'RG',
    ->(
      'IA',
      ->(
        'TI',
        ->(
          'TC',
          ->(
            X('CE','FBP'),
            ->(
              *(
                ->(
                  'SC',
                  ->(
                    X('TM','SPT'),
                    X('FCE','FBA')    // RDT realized as an XOR between follow-up tests
                  )
                ),
                tau                   // exit from loop when results are normal
              ),
              ->(
                +('AI','NC'),
                ->(
                  'FAS',
                  ->(
                    'DDI',
                    +('BL','ICP','MRF')
                  )
                )
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

Explanation of key parts (informal, matching your description):

- Overall structure is a large SEQUENCE (`->`) from Arrival to final concurrent clearances.
- Initial path:
  - `'A'`  `'RG'`  `'IA'`  `'TI'`  `'TC'`.
- Initial diagnostic choice:
  - `X('CE','FBP')` – exclusive choice between Comprehensive ECG or Full Blood Panel.
- Loop for abnormal results:
  - `* ( <body>, tau )`:
    - Body:
      ```text
      ->(
        'SC',
        ->(
          X('TM','SPT'),
          X('FCE','FBA')
        )
      )
      ```
      meaning:
      - Specialist Consultation  exclusive treatment (TM or SPT)  re-diagnostic test (either FCE or FBA).
    - `tau` as the “exit” branch means: after each loop iteration, you either:
      - go back to the loop body (abnormal results), or
      - take `tau` (normal results) and exit the loop.
- Post-normal-results block:
  - `+('AI','NC')` – Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling in true concurrency.
  - Then `'FAS'`  `'DDI'`.
- Final concurrent clearance:
  - `+('BL','ICP','MRF')` – Billing, Insurance Claims Processing, and Medical Records Finalization in true concurrency.

If you’d like, I can also translate this operator notation into actual `pm4py` `ProcessTree` construction code.
