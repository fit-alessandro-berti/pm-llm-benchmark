**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Repeated Activities Within the Same Case:**  
   - **"Verify Documents"** appears multiple times in Case C001 and Case C003.
     - In **C001**, the first "Verify Documents" is an initial identity check; the second is a re-check after the customer submits additional documentation.
     - In **C003**, the first "Verify Documents" is the initial, physical ID check; the second is a re-verification after an account adjustment.
   
   - **"Call Customer"** appears multiple times in Case C002.
     - In **C002**, the first "Call Customer" is to clarify a discrepancy, the second is a follow-up call to confirm adjustments.

   Since "Adjust Account" appears only once per case, and other activities like "Initiate Request," "Submit Additional," and "Approve Request" also appear only once per case, their original names can remain unchanged. The instruction focuses specifically on disambiguating activities repeated within the same case.

2. **Renaming Activities:**

   **Case C001 Changes:**  
   - **First "Verify Documents"**: This is the initial identity check performed by a back-office agent.  
     **Renamed to:** "Verify Documents (Initial Check)"  
     
   - **Second "Verify Documents"**: This occurs after the customer submits additional ID scans. The context suggests this is a re-check or final verification before approval.  
     **Renamed to:** "Verify Documents (Post-Submission Re-check)"

   Since "Call Customer" only appears once in C001, it does not need renaming, but for clarity, we could optionally reflect its purpose:
   - **"Call Customer"** in C001 is specifically to request missing documents.  
     **Optional Renamed to:** "Call Customer (Request Missing Docs)"

   **Case C002 Changes:**  
   - **First "Call Customer"**: Outbound call to clarify a discrepancy.  
     **Renamed to:** "Call Customer (Clarify Discrepancy)"  
     
   - **Second "Call Customer"**: Follow-up call to confirm adjustments were made.  
     **Renamed to:** "Call Customer (Follow-up Confirmation)"

   **"Verify Documents"** and "Adjust Account" each occur only once in C002, so no change is strictly necessary for them.

   **Case C003 Changes:**  
   - **First "Verify Documents"**: Physical verification at the branch.  
     **Renamed to:** "Verify Documents (Initial Branch Check)"  
     
   - **Second "Verify Documents"**: Re-verification after making an internal account adjustment.  
     **Renamed to:** "Verify Documents (Post-Adjustment Re-check)"

   "Call Customer" appears only once in C003, so no disambiguation is needed. "Adjust Account" also appears only once, so it remains as is.

```

4. **Justification of Naming Choices:**
   - **Verify Documents:**  
     Renamed to indicate the stage of verification. The first verification is always "Initial," while the second verification references its trigger (e.g., "Post-Submission," "Post-Adjustment"). These contextual clues come from the "Additional Context" column, which explains why the second verification occurs.
   
   - **Call Customer:**  
     Renamed to describe the call's purpose (e.g., "Clarify Discrepancy" vs. "Follow-up Confirmation"). This clarifies why multiple calls occur and what the agent aims to achieve with each call.
   
   By reflecting the reason and timing in the activity names, the revised log provides a clearer picture of the process flow and the context behind each repeated activity.
