### **Analysis of Loan Application Process Cases**  

---

#### **1. Normative Rule Violations**  
**Normative Rules Enforced:**  
- Strict order: `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [Finalize Documentation (if approved)]  Close Case`.  
- Finalize Documentation is **prohibited** after rejection.  

**Case 1:**  
- **Sequence Compliance:** Fully adheres to the mandatory sequence.  
- **Finalize Documentation:** Completed before closing (approved case).  
- **Violation Status:**  **No violations**.  

**Case 2:**  
- **Violations:**  
  -  **Risk Assessment before Credit Check** (non-sequential step).  
  -  **Skipped "Inform Applicant"** (mandatory after Loan Decision).  
  -  **Finalized Documentation after rejection** (explicitly disallowed).  
- **Violation Status:**  **Severe violations** across multiple steps.  

**Case 3:**  
- **Sequence Compliance:** Adheres to the mandatory order.  
- **Finalize Documentation:** Completed before closing (approved case).  
- **Violation Status:**  **No violations**.

#### **2. Desiderata Failures**  
**Desiderata Defined:**  
- Credit Check within 24 hours of application receipt.  
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision.  
- Optional Follow-Up Call before closing (no penalty).  

**Case 1:**  
-  Credit Check completed in `30 minutes` (within 24 hours).  
-  Inform Applicant done in `2 hours` (within 48 hours).  
-  **Missing Follow-Up Call** (suboptimal).  
- **Summary:** Desiderata failure **only** for omitting Follow-Up Call.  

**Case 2:**  
-  Credit Check completed in `20 minutes` (within 24 hours).  
-  **No Inform Applicant step** (invalidates timing check; normative violation masks desiderata failure).  
-  **No Follow-Up Call**.  
- **Summary:** Desiderata failure **only** for omitting Follow-Up Call (despite normative violations).  

**Case 3:**  
-  **Credit Check delayed by 26 hours** (violates 24-hour rule).  
-  **Inform Applicant delayed by 1.5 days** (violates 48-hour rule).  
-  **No Follow-Up Call**.  
- **Summary:** Fails all desiderata conditions due to delays and missing Follow-Up.

#### **3. Likely Interpretations/Justifications**  
**Case 2:**  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** Likely a human error (e.g., operator confusion or system log discrepancy).  
- **Skipping "Inform Applicant":** Error bypassed due to oversight (e.g., closed case prematurely).  
- **Finalizing after Rejection:**Operator might have misapplied rules for "inactive" cases, assuming documentation was irrelevant.  
- **Justification:** Process gaps due to lack of training or system safeguards.  

**Case 3:**  
- **Delays in Credit Check/Inform Applicant:** Workload bottleneck, backlogged approvals, or insufficient staff.  
- **No Follow-Up Call:** Cost-cutting measure (e.g., prioritize case closure over "nice-to-have" steps).  
- **Justification:** Resource constraints forcing trade-offs between efficiency (desiderata) and basic compliance (normative rules).  

**Follow-Up Call Omissions (All Cases):**  
- **Common Justification:** Perceived as non-essential or automatable (e.g., reliance on automated emails instead of calls).

### **Final Summary**  
| **Case** | **Normative Violations** | **Desiderata Failures**                              |  
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|  
| **1**    | None                      | Missing Follow-Up Call                             |  
| **2**    | Risk Check  Risk Assess, Skip Inform, Finalize Post-Reject | Missing Follow-Up Call                           |  
| **3**    | None                      | Delayed Credit Check, Delayed Inform, Missing Follow-Up |  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Case 2** is the most problematic, with systemic flouting of rules.  
- **Case 3** shows suboptimal efficiency (desiderata) but retains basic compliance.  
- All cases neglect Follow-Up Calls, indicating potential over-reliance on automation.
