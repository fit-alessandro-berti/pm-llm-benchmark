### Anomalies Identified in the DECLARE Model
1. Contradiction between "existence" (C) and "responded_existence" (E): Claim (C) should occur after Evaluate (E) based on the intended process flow. However, the model suggests that both can coexist with equal support and confidence, contradicting the sequential nature of the Claim process.
2. Conflict in "precedence": The claim closing (C) should reasonably follow the evaluation (E), but no evaluation (E) is allowed when a claim is already closed (C), which properly reflects this relationship. However, there could be questions about whether it's possible to introduce an evaluation step for a claim that's already closed.
3. "noncoexistence" (E) and "precedence" (C): A claim cannot be evaluated and then closed in one step, as required by the business logic. The model, however, suggests these steps might perhaps occur together, which would result in inconsistent claim statuses.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies
- Misinterpretation of business requirements: The anomaly may have arisen from a misunderstanding of the sequential nature of the process flow.
- Inconsistent reflection of process changes: Over time, steps in the process may have evolved, but the model has not kept up with these changes.
- Technical issues: The model might be the result of a tool limitation or bug, preventing proper sequencing of steps.
- Tactics to expedite claims: In an attempt to speed up the claim handling process, there might be deliberate omission of steps in the model.

### SQL-based Investigation Strategies
1. To investigate Claim (C) without corresponding Evaluations (E), run:
   ```sql
   -- Find claims closed without evaluation:
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
   WHERE c.claim_status = 'C' AND NOT EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e2 
         WHERE c.claim_id = e2.claim_id AND e2.activity = 'E'
   );
   ```

2. To find Claims (E) with an evaluation and closing steps occurring together, run:
   ```sql
   -- Find any overlaps in evaluating and closing of claims:
   SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.activity, ce.timestamp
   FROM claim_events ce
   WHERE ce.activity = 'E' OR ce.activity = 'C'
   -- This query may require additional logging of evaluation and closing
   -- if necessary to properly identify overlapping succeeded events
   ORDER BY ce.claim_id, ce.timestamp;
   ```

3. To check for Evaluation steps that correspond with assigned adjusters, use:
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.activity, ce.timestamp, ae.name AS adjuster_name
   FROM claim_events ce
   JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
   JOIN adjusters ae ON ce.resource = ae.adjuster_id
   WHERE ce.activity = 'E';
   ```

Each of these SQL queries is designed to help in verifying the expected sequential steps in the claim process and to ensure that inconsistencies with the intended flow are identified and addressed.
