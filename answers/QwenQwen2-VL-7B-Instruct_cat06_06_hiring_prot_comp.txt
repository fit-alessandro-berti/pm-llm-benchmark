Based on the information provided, there are several main differences between the treatment of the protected group (first) and the unprotected group (second):
1. The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants that include expert examinations (e.g., Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge) compared to the unprotected group.
2. The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants that include thorough examinations (e.g., Register at FD -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge) compared to the unprotected group.
3. The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants that result in successful treatments compared to the unprotected group.
4. The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants that result in discharge compared to the unprotected group.
Overall, it appears that the protected group receives more thorough and expert examinations, which may lead to more successful treatments and a higher likelihood of discharge.
