**Event-Sequence Classification and Association Logic**

This dataset represents a system's event sequencing behavior over time, with each type of event correlating to another of similar type, indicating the sequence or association between them.

### Event Types and Preceding/Following Events

We have `number of events` (6999) and `frequency (number of objects)` variables associated with the "confirm order" event as follows:

* Frequency is defined as the number of times an event occurs.
* The frequency variable counts each occurrence, ignoring ordering between the two related events.

Similarly, we observe a similar pattern for other events in relation to its predecessor or successor:

| Event Type | Preceding/Following Event | Relationship (Frequency) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "confirm order" -> "create package" | Confirm Order | 20 / 20 |
| "create package" -> "send package" | Create Package | 15 / 14 |
| "pay order" -> "confirm order" | Pay Order | 10 / 8 |
| ... | ... | ... |

This indicates that the pre- and following orders have a certain frequency relationship where for every 20 occurrences of confirming an order, there are approximately 20 occurrences of creating or sending a package.

By comparing frequencies, we can identify patterns in sequence relationships:

* The consistent ratio of confirm ordering to create/packageing suggests some form of causality while ignoring context.
* Patterns emerge with specific event pairs displaying more frequent follow-up sequences than predecessor events for certain event types: Confirm -> Create and Confirm -> Pay Order both show near-frequency relation (typically the first or sometimes the second time order occurring).
