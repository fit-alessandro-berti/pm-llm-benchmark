Here's a well-documented DuckDB SQL query that meets the requirements specified:
```sql
WITH ranked_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence,
    count(*) AS frequency
  FROM 
    event_log
  GROUP BY 
    case_id
),
top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    variant_sequence,
    frequency
  FROM 
    ranked_variants
  ORDER BY 
    frequency DESC
  LIMIT $K
),
filtered_cases AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id
  FROM 
    ranked_variants
  WHERE 
    variant_sequence IN (SELECT variant_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
)
SELECT 
  case_id,
  activity,
  timestamp
FROM 
  event_log
WHERE 
  case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);
```
Let's break down this query to understand how it addresses the tasks specified:

1.  **Construct a DuckDB SQL query that determines the sequence of activities for each `case_id`, maintaining the order imposed by `timestamp`**: We use the `array_agg` function to gather the `activity` values for each `case_id` while maintaining the order using the `ORDER BY timestamp` clause within the `array_agg` function. This results in an array of activities per case, effectively creating the ordered sequence of activities for each case.

2.  **Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants**: By grouping the event log by `case_id` and aggregating the `activity` values as arrays, we automatically create groups of cases with the same activity sequence. This step is encapsulated in the `ranked_variants` CTE.

3.  **Count how many cases correspond to each variant and determine the top K variants by their frequency**: We calculate the frequency of each variant (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant) within the `ranked_variants` CTE. Then, in the `top_k_variants` CTE, we sort these variants by their frequency in descending order and limit the result to the top K variants.

4.  **Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants**: We first create a filtered list of `case_id`s belonging to the top K variants in the `filtered_cases` CTE. Finally, we return the corresponding events from the original event log that belong to these filtered cases.

Note that the query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the task into smaller, more manageable pieces. The top K variant limit is denoted by the placeholder `$K` which should be replaced with the desired number when running the query.

You can adjust the number of top K variants by replacing `$K` with your desired value when running the query.
