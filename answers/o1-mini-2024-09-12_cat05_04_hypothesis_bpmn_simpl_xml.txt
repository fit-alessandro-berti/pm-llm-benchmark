2. **How does the process ensure proper hand hygiene before proceeding?**
   - **Confidence:** 90%

3. **What are the steps involved in preparing for the procedure as indicated by the "Prepare implements" task?**
   - **Confidence:** 85%

4. **At which point does the process involve getting into sterile clothes, and why is this important?**
   - **Confidence:** 88%

5. **How does the exclusive gateway with `gatewayDirection: Diverging` affect the flow of the process?**
   - **Confidence:** 92%
