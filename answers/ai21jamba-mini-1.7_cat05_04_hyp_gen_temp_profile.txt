### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
	- The average time is approximately 25 hours, with a very low standard deviation of 1 hour. This suggests a highly rigid process for approvals, which might not align with typical business variability.
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
	- The average time is around 7 days, with a standard deviation of 2 days. This long delay, combined with high variability, indicates inconsistent notification practices, potentially caused by resource or backlog issues.
3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
	- The average time is 2 hours, with a standard deviation of 1 hour. This short duration between assignment and closure might indicate cases where claims are prematurely closed without completing necessary evaluations or approvals.
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
	- The average time is only 5 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1 minute. This rapid transition may suggest activity skipping or unrealistic process timing, especially given the typical complexity of evaluations.

### Hypotheses for the Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
	- The low standard deviation suggests a highly controlled process, possibly involving artificial deadlines or scripted approvals that bypass usual evaluations.
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
	- The long average time and high variability might be due to:
		- A backlog in the notification process.
		- External factors, such as delayed customer information or communication issues.
		- Resource constraints, where notifications are deprioritized.
3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
	- Claims closing quickly after assignment might indicate:
		- Premature closure without proper evaluation or approval.
		- Automation errors that mistakenly mark claims as complete.
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
	- The exceptionally short average time and low variability suggest:
		- Skipping intermediate steps, such as evaluation or approval.
		- Misconfigured system logic that prematurely triggers notifications.

### Proposed SQL Queries for Verification

1. **Identify Claims with Short R to P Duration:**sql

```sql
SELECT claim_id, customer_id, submission_date, timestamp AS receive_date, 
       (lead(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp) / 60 AS approve_time_mins
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'A' AND resource = 'Adjuster1'
ORDER BY claim_id;
```
2. **Find Claims with Long P to N Delays and High Variability:**sql

```sql
SELECT claim_id, customer_id, submission_date, 
       (lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp) / 60 AS approve_time_mins,
       (lead(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)) / 60 AS notify_time_mins
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'P' AND resource = 'Adjuster2'
ORDER BY claim_id;
```
3. **Locate Prematurely Closed Claims (A to C):**sql

```sql
SELECT claim_id, customer_id, submission_date, 
       (lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp) / 60 AS assign_time_mins,
       (lead(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp) / 60 AS close_time_mins
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('A', 'C') AND claim_type = 'auto_insurance'
ORDER BY claim_id;
```
4. **Detect Rapid E to N Transitions:**sql

```sql
SELECT claim_id, customer_id, submission_date, 
       (lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp) / 60 AS evaluate_time_mins,
       (lead(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)) / 60 AS notify_time_mins
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E', 'N') AND additional_info LIKE '%automated%'
ORDER BY claim_id;
```
5. **Analyze Resource-Specific Patterns:**sql

```sql
SELECT resource, claim_type, COUNT(*) AS event_count,
       AVG((lead(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp) / 60) AS avg_time_mins,
       STDDEV((lead(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp) / 60) AS stdev_time_mins
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY resource, claim_type
ORDER BY resource, avg_time_mins DESC;
```

These queries will help pinpoint specific claims and resources contributing to the observed anomalies, providing actionable insights for improving the process.
