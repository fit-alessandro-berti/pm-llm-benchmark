<think>We need to produce a solution that constructs an accepting Petri net for a complex insurance claim management process scenario. We have described a process: Customer files Insurance Claim (C), then following steps:

1. Claim Registration (CR): The claim is logged into the system.
2. Document Verification (DV): Customer's documents are verified.
3. Fraud Check (FC): The claim is examined by a special unit to ensure there’s no fraudulent activity.
4. Claim Assessment (CA): The claim is assessed by an adjuster who decides compensation amount.
5. Approval (AP): The claim must be approved by senior manager if the amount surpasses threshold.
6. Payment (P): Approved claim is paid out to customer.
7. Notification (N): The customer is notified about the resolution and payment details.
8. Closure (CL): Claim is closed and archived.

Additionally, there are two loops:
- If documents incomplete after Document Verification (DV), re-submission of documents (RDS) step occurs before process continues.
- Similarly, if Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA).

We need to define a Petri net with places representing states between these activities. We are told that "places represent states" but actually we have transitions for each activity.

I need to produce Python code using pm4py package. The code snippet example is similar to provided. I'll produce something like:

```
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils.petri_utils import add_arc_from_to, remove_place

net = PetriNet(name="InsuranceClaimProcess")
```

Now define places for each state. We have states "start", "claim_registered", "documents_verified", "fraud_checked", "assessed", "approved", "paid", "notified", "closed". But then we also include re-document submission and in-depth investigation loops. So, we can include additional transitions such as "RDS" (Re-Document Submission) and "II" (In-depth Investigation).

But the process: after claim registration, move to document verification; if documents incomplete, then RDS. And if fraud check raises doubts, then II before claim assessment.

So the flow:

Start -> CR (Claim Registration) -> DV (Document Verification). Then maybe loop: If documents not complete, then "RDS" returns to Document Verification? But wait, how do we incorporate re-submission loop? The text says "In some cases, if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs (**Re-Document Submission (RDS)**) before the process continues." So the flow: DV -> possibly RDS. And then from RDS, presumably back to DV or directly to FC? But typically in such processes, the loop would be: if RDS triggered then after re-submission, go back to document verification. Let me see how a typical PDG pattern works for that.

We have multiple arcs:
- Start: initial marking in "start" place.
- CR: claim registration activity (transition) from start state.
- Then from "after CR", we get token to next state "document_verified".
- But maybe we need a "documents submitted" place.

I propose the following design:

Let's define places for each step: 
Place names:
- p_start: representing initial marking
- p_after_CR: after claim registration. (or simply claim_registration)
- p_dv: document verification.
- p_rds: re-document submission state, maybe "dv_loop".
- p_fc: fraud check.
- p_ii: in-depth investigation.
- p_ca: claim assessment.
- p_ap: approval.
- p_p: payment.
- p_n: notification.
- p_cl: closure.

We also need transitions. Transitions:
T_CR (Claim Registration)
T_DV (Document Verification)
T_RDS (Re-Document Submission) 
T_FC (Fraud Check)
T_II (In-depth Investigation)
T_CA (Claim Assessment)
T_AP (Approval)
T_P (Payment)
T_N (Notification)
T_CL (Closure)

We can then add arcs connecting them in a sequence that follows the process.

Let's consider the flow:
Start (p_start) -> T_CR -> p_after_CR. 
Then from p_after_CR, go to T_DV -> p_dv.
From p_dv, if documents are incomplete, there is loop: go to T_RDS -> p_rds, then maybe back to p_dv? Actually, re-submission means that after re-submitting, the verification happens again. So arc from p_rds to T_DV, but we already had a transition from p_dv to T_RDS? But let me consider: The process is: Documents are verified; if incomplete, then "RDS" occurs and then you go back to document verification.
We can have:
- From p_dv -> T_RDS -> p_rds (representing re-document submission). Then from p_rds -> T_DV back to p_dv. But wait that is a loop: p_dv might get tokens after re-document submission cycle. So we need an arc connecting p_rds to the T_DV, which then goes to p_dv.
Alternatively, one possibility is:
- p_dv -> if documents incomplete, go via transition RDS and then after completion of that, the token will be placed in a new place (maybe same as p_dv) so that document verification can happen again. So we have: p_dv -> T_RDS -> p_rds, then from p_rds -> T_DV back to p_dv.
But wait, if documents are verified, they need not go through RDS. But we want the loop possibility, so in Petri net, how do we model branching? Typically, you have one transition that is taken or not taken. In our petri net, we only have arcs and transitions. We can simulate a condition by adding additional arcs: from p_dv, if documents are incomplete, then T_RDS fires, taking token to p_rds. And also from p_dv, if documents are complete, maybe there is an arc directly to T_FC (fraud check). But how do we model such decision? In Petri nets, you can't have guards unless using inhibitor arcs or something similar. However the prompt doesn't mention inhibitors; it only says that transitions represent activities.

Maybe we assume that if documents are incomplete, then RDS occurs. So in our net, after DV, token moves to T_RDS and then goes back to DV. And if documents are complete, maybe T_DV leads directly to FC.
But how do we simulate that? We can add an arc from p_dv to T_FC (for the correct branch) in addition to the RDS loop. But if they conflict, then token might be consumed by both transitions simultaneously. But in Petri nets, it's not possible because tokens can only go through a transition when its input place is marked. We need some structure to enforce mutual exclusivity.

We could simulate that with inhibitor arcs or multiple output places, but the prompt doesn't mention inhibitors. Alternatively, we assume that either one of these transitions will fire depending on conditions and they are not concurrently enabled. But for our code example, we can simply add arcs showing possible loops without worrying about conflict.

I think it's acceptable to include both arcs:
- p_dv -> T_RDS (if incomplete) and also p_dv -> T_FC (if verified). 
But then if RDS fires, token is consumed from p_dv and then placed in p_rds. And p_rds transitions to T_DV which goes back to p_dv. But that might create a loop.

For the fraud check loop:
After T_DV (or maybe after the branch from DV or RDS) we go to Fraud Check: p_fc -> T_FC? Actually, wait, ordering:
Sequence is: CR -> DV -> then either RDS loop if documents are incomplete or direct transition to FC if verified. After that, there's a fraud check step FC. And then possibly loop with II:
After T_FC, maybe if doubts arise, we do an in-depth investigation (II). So similar structure: p_fc -> T_II leads to p_ii, and then from p_ii -> T_FC back to p_fc. But wait, that would be a direct loop on fraud check? Let's analyze:
After DV branch, the token goes to p_dv. Then if documents are complete, we want to go directly to FC. So add arc: p_dv -> T_FC which leads to p_fc.
So for the fraud check loop: from p_fc, if fraud is suspected (i.e., doubt raised) then there's a loop: p_fc -> T_II (In-depth investigation) leading to p_ii, and then from p_ii -> T_FC returning token to p_fc. But that would be a loop on FC: after II, token goes back to p_fc. And if fraud check is clear, then go forward to CA.
So after p_fc, add an arc for the "good" branch: p_fc -> T_CA (Claim Assessment) leading to p_ca.

After claim assessment, we have:
p_ca -> T_AP (Approval) leads to p_ap.
Then p_ap -> T_P (Payment) leads to p_p.
Then p_p -> T_N (Notification) leads to p_n.
Finally, p_n -> T_CL (Closure) leads to p_cl.

That final marking is fm with token in p_cl. And the initial marking im should be placed in start state.

We also have a loop for re-document submission: from p_dv, if incomplete, then arc to RDS: p_dv -> T_RDS -> p_rds, and from p_rds -> T_DV (which leads back to p_dv). So that's the loop.

So we need to build net as follows:

Define PetriNet "InsuranceClaimProcess" (or name accordingly).

Define places:
- start: initial token
- after_CR: after claim registration
- dv: document verification state.
- fc: fraud check state.
- ca: claim assessment state.
- ap: approval state.
- p: payment state.
- n: notification state.
- cl: closure state.
For loops:
- rds: re-document submission state.
- ii: in-depth investigation state.

Define transitions for each step:
T_CR = Transition("CR", label="Claim Registration")
T_DV = Transition("DV", label="Document Verification")
T_RDS = Transition("RDS", label="Re-Document Submission")
T_FC = Transition("FC", label="Fraud Check")
T_II = Transition("II", label="In-depth Investigation")
T_CA = Transition("CA", label="Claim Assessment")
T_AP = Transition("AP", label="Approval")
T_P = Transition("P", label="Payment")
T_N = Transition("N", label="Notification")
T_CL = Transition("CL", label="Closure")

Then add arcs:
- From start to T_CR: arc from p_start -> T_CR.
- From T_CR to after_CR.
- From after_CR to T_DV (or perhaps directly? Actually, after CR state is a place representing that claim registration complete. So arc from after_CR to T_DV.)
But in our earlier description we said "p_after_CR" so I'll define that as p_cr.

I will define places with names: p_start, p_cr, p_dv, p_rds, p_fc, p_ca, p_ap, p_p, p_n, p_cl, and also for loop states p_ii if needed.
Arcs:

For claim registration:
- arc from p_start to T_CR
- arc from T_CR to p_cr

Then document verification branch:
- arc from p_cr to T_DV (leading to p_dv)
So then p_cr -> T_DV leads to p_dv.

Now, for re-document submission loop: We add arcs:
- From p_dv to T_RDS leading to p_rds
- And from p_rds to T_DV (leading back to p_dv). 
But we also want a direct arc from p_dv to fraud check. But then that would be ambiguous because token in p_dv might go either T_RDS or T_FC. In Petri nets, if two transitions have input from the same place, they become enabled concurrently unless there's inhibitor arcs etc. But for our construction, it's fine.

So add:
- From p_dv to T_RDS -> p_rds.
- Also, from p_dv directly to T_FC -> p_fc (for verified documents).

Then fraud check loop: 
After T_FC, token goes to p_fc.
We then add arc:
- From p_fc to T_II -> p_ii (if doubts arise).
And then:
- From p_ii to T_FC -> p_fc. That creates a loop on fraud check.
Also, from p_fc directly to T_CA -> p_ca (for no doubt).

Then continue:
- After T_CA at p_ca, add arc: from p_ca to T_AP -> p_ap.
- Then from p_ap to T_P -> p_p.
- Then from p_p to T_N -> p_n.
- Finally, from p_n to T_CL -> p_cl.

So overall sequence is:

start (p_start) --T_CR--> cr (p_cr)
cr --T_DV--> dv (p_dv)
dv --T_RDS--> rds (p_rds)
rds --T_DV--> dv (back to p_dv)  [loop]
dv --T_FC--> fc (p_fc)
fc --T_II--> ii (p_ii)
ii --T_FC--> fc (back to p_fc)   [loop]
fc --T_CA--> ca (p_ca)
ca --T_AP--> ap (p_ap)
ap --T_P--> p (p_p)
p --T_N--> n (p_n)
n --T_CL--> cl (p_cl)

I will define marking im and fm:
- im = Marking() with token in start: im[p_start] = 1.
- fm = Marking() with token in closure: fm[p_cl] = 1.

Additionally, we might want to remove the loop places if necessary. But I'll leave them since they represent possible re-try steps.

I will produce code that constructs the Petri net using pm4py package. 

I need to use:
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils.petri_utils import add_arc_from_to

And then define net = PetriNet("InsuranceClaimProcess").

Define transitions and places.

Code structure:

```
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils.petri_utils import add_arc_from_to

net = PetriNet("InsuranceClaimProcess")

add_arc_from_to(t_fc, p_fc, net)

# loop for in-depth investigation on fraud check if needed
add_arc_from_to(p_fc, t_ii, net)
add_arc_from_to(t_ii, p_ii, net)
add_arc_from_to(p_ii, t_fc, net)  # back to fraud check

# continue process from fraud check to claim assessment
add_arc_from_to(p_fc, t_ca, net)
add_arc_from_to(t_ca, p_ca, net)

# subsequent steps:

add_arc_from_to(p_ap, t_p, net)
add_arc_from_to(t_p, p_p, net)

add_arc_from_to(t_n, p_n, net)
add_arc_from_to(p_n, t_cl, net)
add_arc_from_to(t_cl, p_cl, net)

# initial marking: token in start
im = Marking()
im[p_start] = 1

# final marking: token in closure
fm = Marking()
fm[p_cl] = 1

print("Petri Net constructed for Insurance Claim Process")
```

I will produce that code snippet. The answer must be plain text with Python code.

I'll also check if there is any possible conflict regarding two arcs from p_dv: one to T_RDS and one directly to T_FC. But that's acceptable since the process simulation might allow both transitions to become enabled concurrently, but then only one will fire if tokens are managed properly. But note that in a Petri net with no inhibitor arc, if there is token in p_dv, both T_RDS and T_FC will be enabled simultaneously. This means that in an actual run, they could compete. However, this might not reflect the intended behavior exactly but it's acceptable for constructing a Petri net model.

Alternatively, we can remove the direct arc from p_dv to t_fc if we assume always re-document submission loop if documents are incomplete. But instructions said: "In some cases, if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs before the process continues." That implies that typically if documents are complete, then you go directly to fraud check.

Maybe one possibility is to include inhibitor arcs for controlling this decision. However, since we're not asked to use inhibitor arcs and only using pm4py library, I'll assume it's acceptable.

Similarly for fraud check loop: p_fc -> T_II and then back from p_ii -> T_FC can allow token in p_fc be consumed by both transitions if t_fc fires or t_ii fires. But that might conflict with intended simulation. However, I'll leave them as is.

We could structure the net such that the transitions represent the decisions, but then we need to have separate tokens in different places to represent the state of documents being correct or not. But our prompt doesn't require modeling conditions explicitly. It only requires an accepting Petri net with loops. So it's fine.

I'll produce code accordingly.

Also I can add comments explaining each step.

I will produce code as final answer.

I'll produce a final answer in plain text: 

I'll now produce the final answer.</think>Below is one acceptable solution. In this example we create places for every “state” of the process (including extra places to model loops) and transitions for every activity. Note that when documents or fraudchecks need reexamination, the Petri net “loops back” via extra arcs. (In a real system you might use inhibitor arcs to “choose” between branches; here we simply show both possibilities.) 

Below is the complete Python code:

#!/usr/bin/env python
"""

  • Document Verification (DV) – if documents are incomplete, a Re-Document Submission (RDS) step occurs before trying DV again.
  • Fraud Check (FC) – if doubts arise, an In-depth Investigation (II) is performed and the net loops back to FC.

------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

1. The net starts with a token at p_start (a new claim arrives).
2. t_cr (“Claim Registration”) moves the process into the p_cr state.
3. Then, from p_cr, t_dv fires and sends the token to p_dv (document verification).
4. From p_dv two arcs are available:
   • One goes via t_rds (Re-Document Submission) then back to DV (p_dv), modeling a resubmission loop.
   • The other goes directly via t_fc (Fraud Check) if the documents are verified.
5. At the fraud check stage, an indepth investigation may be required. Here p_fc fires t_ii and loops back via p_ii  t_fc.
6. Once FC is cleared, the net proceeds through claim assessment, approval, payment, notification and finally closure.

The initial marking (im) starts at “start” and the final marking (fm) ends in “closure.”

This construction meets the requirements for an accepting Petri net of the described insurance claim management process using pm4py.
