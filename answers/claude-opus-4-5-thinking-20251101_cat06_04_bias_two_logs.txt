# Bias Analysis: Comparing Group A and Group B Event Logs

## Executive Summary

**Group B's event log exhibits bias** that systematically advantages its members through score adjustment mechanisms tied to the `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` attributes. This creates **disparate impact against Group A (Protected Group)**, who cannot access these advantages.

## Comparative Analysis

### Key Attribute Differences

| Attribute | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| LocalResident | All FALSE | All TRUE |
| CommunityGroup | All "None" | Some have "Highland Civic Darts Club" |
| ScoreAdjustment | Always 0 | +10 for community members |

---

## Evidence of Bias

### 1. The Community Boost Mechanism

The `ScoreAdjustment` column reveals a **+10 "Community Boost"** applied exclusively to Group B members with community group affiliations:

| Case | Group | Preliminary Score | Adjustment | Final Score | Decision |
|------|-------|-------------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| U001 | B | 720 | +10 | **730** | Approved |
| U003 | B | 695 | +10 | **705** | Approved |

### 2. Critical Comparison: Similar Scores, Different Outcomes

The most compelling evidence of bias:

```

  P002 (Group A): Score 710, No Adjustment  REJECTED            
  U003 (Group B): Score 695, +10 Boost     APPROVED (at 705)   

```

**Group A member P002 was rejected with a score of 710**, while **Group B member U003 was approved despite starting with a lower score of 695**. The community boost elevated U003 above the apparent threshold.

## How Bias Manifests

### Structural Barriers for Group A

```
Group A Members                    Group B Members
                                        
                                        
LocalResident = FALSE              LocalResident = TRUE
                                        
                                        
CommunityGroup = None              CommunityGroup = Club Membership
                                        
                                        
ScoreAdjustment = 0                ScoreAdjustment = +10
                                        
                                        
Must meet full threshold           Effective 10-point advantage
```

### Systematic Differences

1. **Access Barrier**: Group A members consistently have `LocalResident = FALSE` and `CommunityGroup = None`, suggesting they are either:
   - Excluded from these community networks, or
   - Not recognized within the system as having such affiliations

2. **Scoring Inequality**: The 10-point boost effectively **lowers the approval threshold** for eligible Group B members from ~710 to ~700

3. **Proxy Discrimination**: The `CommunityGroup` attribute acts as a **proxy variable** that correlates with group membership, creating indirect discrimination

## Outcome Analysis

| Group | Approved | Rejected | Approval Rate |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Group A (Protected) | 2 (P001, P003) | 1 (P002) | 66.7% |
| Group B (Unprotected) | 2 (U001, U003) | 1 (U002) | 66.7% |

While approval rates appear equal in this small sample, the **mechanism** is biased:
- Group B members with community ties can be approved with **lower preliminary scores**
- Group A members must rely solely on their unadjusted scores

---

## Conclusion

The bias manifests through a **seemingly neutral policy** (rewarding community involvement) that produces **disparate impact**:

| Factor | Impact on Protected Group |
|--------|---------------------------|
| LocalResident attribute | Creates structural exclusion |
| CommunityGroup affiliation | Unavailable pathway to score boost |
| ScoreAdjustment mechanism | Systematically advantages Group B |

**This represents indirect/structural discrimination**: Group A faces a higher effective bar for approval because they cannot access the community boost mechanism that helps Group B members with borderline scores achieve approval.
