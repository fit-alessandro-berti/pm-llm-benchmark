### Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process

Let's analyze each case in the event log to identify deviations from the normative process.

#### **Case 1: No Violations**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close
- **Compliance:** Follows the expected flow for sufficient inventory. No violations.

#### **Case 2: Violation (Incorrect Order of Activities)**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close
- **Violation:**
  - "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment," which violates the rule that payment must be authorized before items are packaged.
  - The normative process states: *"Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging.*
  - Packaging items before payment authorization is illogical because payment validation is a prerequisite for preparing the order for shipment.

#### **Case 3: Violation (Shipping After Cancellation)**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close
- **Violation:**
  - "Ship order" occurs **after** "Cancel order," which is explicitly prohibited in the normative description.
  - The normative process states: *"It would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping), and thus the next reasonable step is to "Close order."*
  - Shipping an order after cancellation is nonsensical because the order was already canceled, and no items should be shipped.

#### **Case 4: No Violations**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Cancel  Close
- **Compliance:** Follows the expected flow for insufficient inventory. No violations.

#### **Case 5: Violation (Missing "Package Items")**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close
- **Violation:**
  - "Ship order" occurs **without** a preceding "Package items" step.
  - The normative process states: *"Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with "Ship order."*
  - Shipping an order without packaging it first is a violation because items must be prepared before they can be shipped.

### Summary of Violations:
1. **Case 2:**
   - "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
   - **Rule Violated:** Payment must be authorized before packaging.

2. **Case 3:**
   - "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
   - **Rule Violated:** Shipping should not occur after cancellation.

3. **Case 5:**
   - "Ship order" occurs without a preceding "Package items."
   - **Rule Violated:** Items must be packaged before shipping.

### Additional Notes:
- **Case 3** also has a logical inconsistency in authorizing payment after checking inventory but before canceling the order. While the normative process does not explicitly forbid this, it is unusual to authorize payment for an order that is later canceled. This could be considered a **potential inefficiency** rather than a strict violation, but it does not align with the intended flow.
- **Case 4** is the only case that correctly follows the cancellation path without any deviations.

### Final Answer:
**Cases with Violations:**
- **Case 2:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
- **Case 3:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
- **Case 5:** "Ship order" occurs without a preceding "Package items."

**Cases with No Violations:**
- **Case 1** and **Case 4** follow the normative process correctly.
