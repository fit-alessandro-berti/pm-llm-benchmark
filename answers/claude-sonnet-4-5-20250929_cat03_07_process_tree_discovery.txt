Based on the event log analysis, here is the final process tree model:

```
-> (
    'RA',
    -> (
        'VF',
        -> (
            'AE',
            -> (
                * (
                    -> ( 'AD', tau ),
                    -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' )
                ),
                -> (
                    'SC',
                    'AC'
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation of the model:**

1. **RA** (Receive Application) - always happens first

2. **VF** (Validate Form) - follows after receiving application

3. **AE** (Assess Eligibility) - follows after validation

4. **Loop structure** `* ( -> ( 'AD', tau ), -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) )`
   - The "do" part: `-> ( 'AD', tau )` - Execute Approval Decision followed by silent step (exit possibility)
   - The "redo" part: `-> ( 'RMI', 'VF' )` - Request Missing Info, then re-Validate Form
   - This captures the pattern where:
     - Case 2: Goes directly to AD (exits loop immediately via tau)
     - Case 1: Executes RMIVF once, then AD
     - Case 3: Executes RMIVF twice, then AD

5. **SC** (Send Confirmation) - follows after approval decision

6. **AC** (Archive Case) - final activity

This model captures all three observed traces:
- **Case 2**: RAVFAEADSCAC (no loop iterations)
- **Case 1**: RAVFAERMIVFADSCAC (one loop iteration)
- **Case 3**: RAVFAERMIRMIVFADSCAC (two loop iterations)

The model balances fitness (accepts all observed behavior), precision (doesn't allow arbitrary activity orders), and simplicity (minimal structure to capture the essential pattern).
