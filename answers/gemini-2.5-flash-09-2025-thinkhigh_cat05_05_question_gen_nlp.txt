This complex supply chain raises critical questions spanning technology, finance, risk management, and global operations.

### Sourcing, Supplier Management, and Geopolitical Risk

1.  How is the company structuring its supplier contracts to enforce consistent quality metrics and compliance standards across five geographically diverse regions (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, US), each operating under different regulatory frameworks?
2.  Given the critical reliance on sole-source components (e.g., microprocessors from Taiwan), what specific Tier 1 and Tier 2 contingency plans are activated if a major geopolitical event or natural disaster completely shuts down the primary fabrication plant for 90 days?
3.  How does the R&D team integrate supplier capacity constraints, lead times, and technological roadmaps into the initial product design phase to prevent sourcing bottlenecks two years down the line?
4.  What specific measures are in place to vet and audit the environmental and labor practices of all downstream suppliers to ensure strict compliance and mitigate significant reputational risk?

### Manufacturing and Operational Excellence

5.  Considering the 24/7, multi-shift operation in the Malaysian assembly plant, what key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to measure operational efficiency, and how is quality consistency maintained across shifts with diverse personnel?
6.  Describe the robustness of the digital traceability system: Can a specific defect found in a unit returned by a consumer in Europe be traced back precisely to the component batch, the specific assembly machine, and the shift worker in Malaysia?
7.  If manufacturing yield drops unexpectedly, how quickly can the production schedule be adjusted, and what is the typical ripple effect on the purchase orders already submitted to the long lead-time suppliers (e.g., OLED screens)?

### Logistics, Distribution, and Inventory Strategy

8.  What precise quantitative methodology (e.g., total landed cost analysis vs. opportunity cost of lost sales) is used to determine which markets utilize high-cost JIT air freight versus cost-optimized aggregated monthly cargo shipments?
9.  How does the company manage the significant financial exposure posed by fluctuating exchange rates between the multiple currencies used for procurement (e.g., TWD, JPY, EUR) and the primary sales currencies (e.g., USD, EUR)?
10. What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of global logistics partners, and what is the maximum acceptable delay in customs clearance before triggering a switch to an expedited logistics corridor?
11. If there is a sudden global spike in demand for a legacy model component (e.g., due to repair needs or unexpected market retention), how does the inventory strategy prioritize existing production needs over after-sales support requirements?

### Technology, Data, and Forecasting

12. How accurate are the machine learning models in predicting demand for products launching in *new* markets or during periods of macroeconomic volatility, and what financial buffer is applied to account for the model’s margin of error?
13. Given the sensitivity of global trade data (invoices, customs declarations), what specific cybersecurity protocols are implemented to prevent industrial espionage or data breach across the multinational digital systems?
14. How does the current ERP system handle the immediate integration and validation of highly diverse regulatory compliance data (e.g., safety certifications, recycling mandates) across all regional distribution centers?

### Risk, Compliance, and Continuous Improvement

15. What is the process and timeline for implementing system-wide changes to the supply chain (e.g., shifting assembly location or major supplier replacement) following a necessary product recall based on a safety compliance issue?
16. How is the continuous improvement initiative measured, and what is the average annual percentage reduction target for lead times, production costs, and overall carbon footprint?
17. What strategic investments are being planned over the next three years to increase automation in materials handling and regulatory documentation, thereby reducing human error and improving compliance efficiency?
18. Considering the global complexity, how are the performance incentives structured for supply chain executives to ensure they are balancing the competing goals of cost reduction, inventory minimization, and maintaining high service levels?

### After-Sales and Reverse Logistics

19. Describe the feedback loop that integrates data gathered from warranty claims, service center reports, and product returns (reverse logistics) back into the upstream processes of R&D and manufacturing quality assurance.
20. For high-value returns (like undelivered VIP pre-orders), what system is in place to ensure immediate quality inspection and rapid reintroduction of the product into the primary inventory stream, minimizing holding costs?
