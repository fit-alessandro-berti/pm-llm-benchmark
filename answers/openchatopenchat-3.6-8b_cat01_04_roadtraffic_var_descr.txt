1. Create Fine: The fine is generated or issued.
2. Send Fine: The fine is sent to the offender.
3. Insert Fine Notification: A notification or record is created for the fine.
4. Add penalty: A penalty is added to the fine amount.
5. Send for Credit Collection: The fine is sent for credit collection if the offender fails to pay.
6. Payment: The offender pays the fine.
7. Appeal to Judge: The offender may appeal the fine to a judge.
8. Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture: An appeal to the prefecture is made.
9. Send Appeal to Prefecture: The appeal is sent to the prefecture.
10. Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture: The result of the appeal from the prefecture is received.
11. Notify Result Appeal to Offender: The result of the appeal is notified to the offender.
12. Send for Credit Collection: The fine is sent for credit collection if the offender still fails to pay after the appeal process.
13. Payment -> Payment: Multiple payments are made.

The data provided includes the frequency of each process variant (how often it occurs) and its performance metric (a calculated value based on the process). The processes with different frequencies and performance metrics show how various actions are taken and the costs associated with each action.
