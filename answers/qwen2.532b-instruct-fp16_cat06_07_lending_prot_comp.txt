The main differences between the loan application paths provided can be attributed to various factors including the presence or absence of collateral assessment visits, co-signer requests, and loan denials. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Frequency of Paths:**
   - The most common path leads to a **loan denial** after requesting a co-signer:
     ```
     Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied
     Frequency = 335, Performance = 389,998.313
     ```

   - Another frequent path is a **loan denial** after a visit to assess collateral:
     ```
     Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied
     Frequency = 297, Performance = 389,998.141
     ```

   - A frequent path where the loan is **approved** and a co-signer request is not needed:
     ```
     Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement
     Frequency = 332, Performance = 260,013.446
     ```

### 2. **Loan Approvals:**
   - A significant number of loans are approved after a single visit to assess collateral:
     ```
     Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement
     Frequency = 188, Performance = 389,994.777
     ```

   - Another significant path involves both a collateral visit and a co-signer request:
     ```
     Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement
     Frequency = 183, Performance = 390,000.066
     ```

### 3. **Multiple Visits:**
   - Some paths involve multiple visits for collateral assessment before a final decision:
     ```
     Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied
     Frequency = 23, Performance = 440,003.565

     Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement
     Frequency = 12, Performance = 439,983.167
     ```

### 4. **Performance Differences:**
   - The performance (likely indicating loan amounts or some other metric) varies slightly between paths that lead to a denial and those leading to an agreement:
     - Paths resulting in a loan denial have performances around 389,998.
     - Paths resulting in a signed loan agreement typically have higher performances.

### Key Observations Using Domain Knowledge:

1. **Co-signer Requests:**
   - A high frequency of co-signer requests often leads to loan denials, suggesting that borrowers with weaker credit or collateral need additional support but are still not sufficient.
   
2. **Collateral Assessment:**
   - Multiple visits for collateral assessment indicate complex cases where the initial visit was inconclusive or required further investigation.

3. **Skipped Examination Path:**
   - This path has a lower performance score, implying that these loans may be smaller or involve less risky borrowers who do not require extensive examinations.

4. **Loan Denials vs Approvals:**
   - Loan denials are more frequent than approvals, indicating stringent underwriting criteria.
   
5. **Multiple Steps:**
   - Paths with multiple steps (like repeated visits) suggest complex loan cases that might be high-risk or high-value loans, hence the higher performance scores.

### Conclusion:
The primary differences stem from the complexity of each application process, as measured by the number of collateral assessments and co-signer requests. Loan denials tend to occur more frequently than approvals, particularly in cases involving additional steps like requesting a co-signer. The loan amounts are generally similar across most paths but higher for complex or high-value loans requiring multiple assessment visits.
