## Optimizing Precision Parts Inc.'s Production Scheduling: A Process Mining Approach

Precision Parts Inc.'s struggles with tardiness, high WIP, and unpredictable lead times are classic symptoms of an inadequate scheduling approach in a complex, dynamic manufacturing environment. The current reliance on basic, localized dispatching rules, without a holistic, data-driven perspective, is clearly insufficient. Leveraging the detailed MES event logs, process mining offers a powerful lens to dissect the current system's performance, diagnose its ailments, and architect significantly improved, data-driven scheduling strategies.

### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

Process mining is the cornerstone of understanding the true operational reality at Precision Parts Inc. By transforming the MES event logs into a series of event streams, we can reconstruct the actual process execution, moving beyond theoretical routings to observe what truly happens on the shop floor.

**Reconstructing Actual Job Flows:**

The MES event log, with its `Timestamp`, `Case ID (Job ID)`, `Activity/Task`, and `Resource (Machine ID)` fields, is ideally structured for process discovery. Using algorithms like the Alpha miner or Heuristics miner (or more advanced ones like Inductive Miner for handling noise and concurrency), we can visualize the as-is process model. This model will reveal:

*   **Actual Routings:** The sequences of tasks as they were executed for each job, highlighting deviations from planned routings, rework loops, or parallel processing.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Which specific machines and operators were used for each task.
*   **Event Sequencing:** The precise order of operations, including waiting periods and processing times.

**Specific Process Mining Techniques and Metrics:**

*   **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
    *   **Technique:** Calculate the time difference between the first and last event for each `Case ID (Job ID)`.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Case Duration:** Total time from job release to final completion.
        *   **Lead Time Distribution:** Analyze the histogram of case durations to understand variability and identify typical lead times.
        *   **Makespan:** The maximum case duration, representing the longest time any job took.

*   **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):**
    *   **Technique:** For each task occurrence, identify the `Timestamp` of `Queue Entry` (if logged) or infer it as the `Timestamp` of the resource becoming available after the previous task. The `Timestamp` of `Task Start` on the same resource marks the end of the wait.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Average Queue Time per Work Center/Machine:** Understand which queues are the longest.
        *   **Queue Time Distribution per Work Center/Machine:** Identify outlier waiting times.
        *   **Percentage of Time Spent Waiting:** Calculate the proportion of a job's lifecycle spent waiting at each stage.

*   **Resource Utilization (Machine and Operator):**
    *   **Technique:** For each `Resource (Machine ID)` or `Operator ID`, aggregate event durations.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Total Working Time:** Sum of `Task Duration (Actual)` for all tasks performed on a resource.
        *   **Total Setup Time:** Sum of `Task Duration (Actual)` for `Setup Start` to `Setup End` events.
        *   **Total Idle Time:** Total time a resource was available but not processing a task or undergoing setup. This can be calculated by identifying gaps between the `Task End` of one job/setup and the `Setup Start` or `Task Start` of the next on that resource.
        *   **Utilization Rate:** (Total Working Time + Total Setup Time) / Total Available Time.
        *   **Productive Time vs. Setup Time Ratio:** Understand how much of the active time is spent on value-adding processing versus non-value-adding setup.

*   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times Analysis:**
    *   **Technique:** This is a critical area. For each machine, we need to explicitly link the `Setup End` timestamp of the current job to the `Setup Start` timestamp of the *next* job on that *same* machine. We can use the `Previous job` note (if consistently populated) or infer the preceding job by looking at the `Task End` of the previous job on that machine.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Average Setup Time per Machine:** Baseline setup duration.
        *   **Setup Time Matrix (if specific job properties are available):** If job characteristics (e.g., material type, tolerances) are recorded or can be inferred, we can build a matrix showing average setup times from Job A to Job B on Machine X.
        *   **Setup Time Variance:** Identify machines with high variability in setup times, potentially indicating inconsistent setup procedures or tool management.
        *   **Total Setup Time Reduction Potential:** Quantify the total time spent on setups to understand the impact of optimization.

*   **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
    *   **Technique:** Compare the `Task End` timestamp for the final operation of each job against its `Order Due Date`.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of jobs completed by their due date.
        *   **Average Tardiness:** Average number of days/hours jobs were late.
        *   **Maximum Tardiness:** The longest delay for any job.
        *   **Tardiness Distribution:** Histogram of lateness.
        *   **Root Cause of Tardiness (Variant Analysis):** Compare process models and performance metrics of on-time jobs versus late jobs to identify common deviations, prolonged waiting times, or resource bottlenecks that correlate with lateness.

*   **Impact of Disruptions:**
    *   **Technique:** Overlay `Breakdown Start` and `Priority Change` events onto the process execution timelines.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Downtime Duration:** Total time machines were down due to breakdowns.
        *   **Frequency of Breakdowns per Resource:** Identify unreliable machines.
        *   **Impact of Priority Changes:** Analyze how many jobs were preempted, how much their completion was delayed, and if "hot jobs" actually arrived and were processed promptly without causing excessive disruption to others.
        *   **Recovery Time:** Time taken for the system to return to a stable state after a disruption.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

The analysis from step 1 will illuminate the underlying dysfunctions. Here's how process mining helps pinpoint specific pathologies:

*   **Bottleneck Identification:**
    *   **Process Mining Insight:** Bottleneck resources will exhibit the longest average queue times, highest workload (total processing and setup time), and potentially the lowest utilization if they are also prone to breakdowns or frequent setups. Heatmaps of queue times on process maps will highlight these points.
    *   **Evidence:** A machine (e.g., MILL-03) consistently shows queue times exceeding 8-12 hours, even when idle for short periods between jobs. Its total active time is high, but a significant portion is spent waiting for upstream operations or itself being a bottleneck.

*   **Poor Task Prioritization:**
    *   **Process Mining Insight:** Variant analysis comparing jobs with "High" priority and "Medium" priority. If high-priority jobs are still experiencing significant delays or waiting behind medium-priority jobs, the dispatching rule is ineffective. Analyzing job flows with `Priority Change` events will show if "hot jobs" are genuinely expedited or if their arrival causes cascading delays.
    *   **Evidence:** High-priority jobs (e.g., JOB-7005) are observed to enter the queue at MILL-02 and wait for 4 hours, despite the machine being available for 1 hour after finishing a medium-priority job. This indicates the dispatching rule at MILL-02 doesn't effectively prioritize the urgent job.

*   **Suboptimal Sequencing and Increased Setup Times:**
    *   **Process Mining Insight:** Examining the setup time matrix or analyzing sequences of jobs on critical machines (especially those with high setup variability). If a machine frequently switches between job families with long setup times (e.g., from a high-tolerance grinding job to a rough milling job), this points to a sequencing issue.
    *   **Evidence:** On LATH-02, the average setup time between jobs requiring different tooling configurations is 90 minutes, whereas processing similar jobs consecutively results in an average setup time of only 30 minutes. The current schedule frequently alternates these, leading to an excess of 60 minutes of setup time per transition.

*   **Starvation of Downstream Resources:**
    *   **Process Mining Insight:** Analyze the flow from a particular upstream resource to downstream ones. If an upstream resource is overloaded or experiencing frequent delays, downstream resources that depend on its output will experience starvation. Look for periods where downstream machines (e.g., GRIND-01) are idle but have no jobs in their queue, while the preceding machine (e.g., MILL-03) is heavily loaded and delaying job completion.
    *   **Evidence:** GRIND-01 is idle for 30% of its operational time. Process analysis shows that jobs finishing milling (MILL-03) are delayed by an average of 5 hours due to milling bottlenecks, thus starving GRIND-01.

*   **Bullwhip Effect in WIP:**
    *   **Process Mining Insight:** Track the cumulative WIP for specific job types or across the entire shop floor over time. If process mining reveals erratic fluctuations in WIP levels, with periods of high accumulation followed by rapid depletion (often associated with expediting), it suggests poor scheduling and batching decisions. Analyzing the distribution of waiting times at each station can reveal where WIP tends to build up.
    *   **Evidence:** The WIP count at the queue for HEAT-TREAT-01 fluctuates wildly, peaking at 20 jobs, then dropping to 2 jobs within a few hours, indicating that jobs are being released to it without proper capacity leveling or that upstream delays are unpredictable, leading to either massive queues or periods of starvation.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

The diagnosed pathologies stem from a confluence of factors, often exacerbated by the lack of a sophisticated scheduling system:

*   **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Rules like FCFS or EDD are myopic. They don't account for resource availability across the entire shop, true processing times (which vary), or the complex interplay of setup times and priorities. They are inherently reactive, not proactive.
    *   **Process Mining Contribution:** By simulating what *would have happened* under different rules (as we'll discuss in simulation) and by showing the real-world consequences of the current rules (e.g., high WIP and tardiness), process mining validates the inadequacy of these static rules.

*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Without a system that synthesizes real-time shop floor status (machine availability, queue contents, estimated task completion), schedulers are working with incomplete or outdated information. This leads to suboptimal decisions.
    *   **Process Mining Contribution:** Process mining *creates* this visibility by reconstructing historical events. This historical data forms the basis for building systems that *will* provide real-time visibility.

*   **Inaccurate Estimations:**
    *   **Root Cause:** If planned task durations or setup times are significantly off, any schedule built on them will be flawed. This can be due to not accounting for variability, not using historical data, or not understanding sequence-dependent setups.
    *   **Process Mining Contribution:** Process mining directly provides actual historical task durations and setup times. This data is crucial for building more accurate duration models and identifying sequences that incur excessive setup costs.

*   **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:**
    *   **Root Cause:** This is a classic optimization problem. If not explicitly modeled and factored into scheduling decisions, it leads to increased non-value-added time.
    *   **Process Mining Contribution:** The explicit analysis of setup times based on preceding jobs is a direct output of process mining and quantifies the problem, justifying the need for a strategy to address it.

*   **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Decisions made at one work center without considering the downstream impact create bottlenecks and starvation.
    *   **Process Mining Contribution:** The process maps clearly visualize the dependencies and flow between work centers. Analyzing variations that lead to delays or WIP buildup will highlight where coordination failures occur.

*   **Inadequate Response to Disruptions:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The current system likely lacks a robust mechanism to reschedule dynamically when breakdowns occur or urgent jobs arrive, leading to cascading delays.
    *   **Process Mining Contribution:** By showing the *impact* of disruptions (e.g., how a breakdown on MILL-02 caused delays for all subsequent jobs that needed its output), process mining demonstrates the need for a more adaptive scheduling system that can re-optimize in real-time.

Process mining differentiates issues by analyzing the *consequences*. If a machine is idle, process mining can tell us: Is it idle because it just finished a job and is waiting for the next one to be assigned (scheduling/dispatching issue)? Is it idle because the *previous* process step is delayed (upstream bottleneck)? Or is it idle because it's down for maintenance (resource reliability issue)? By correlating these events, we can attribute root causes more accurately.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

Moving beyond static rules, we can leverage process mining insights to create dynamic, adaptive, and predictive scheduling strategies:

**Strategy 1: Enhanced, Adaptive Dispatching Rules with Predictive Insights**

*   **Core Logic:** Implement a set of dispatching rules at each work center that dynamically considers multiple, prioritized factors. This is a form of **Heuristic Scheduling** or **Priority-Based Scheduling** enriched with real-time data and predictive elements.
*   **Process Mining Insights Used:**
    *   **Average Task Durations & Variance:** To provide more realistic estimates for remaining processing time.
    *   **Average Queue Times:** To understand current congestion levels.
    *   **Setup Time Matrix:** To estimate setup costs for potential job sequences.
    *   **Machine Status:** Real-time availability, which can be inferred from the MES data.
    *   **Job Priority & Due Dates:** Essential input.
    *   **Downstream Load:** Estimated completion times of jobs ahead of the current job on its subsequent operations, to predict potential future bottlenecks.
*   **Key Factors for Rule Prioritization (example at a work center):**
    1.  **Urgency:** Jobs with imminent due dates or "hot job" status.
    2.  **Setup Minimization:** Prioritize jobs that minimize setup time on the current machine based on the last job processed (using the setup matrix).
    3.  **Workload Balancing:** Consider the load on downstream machines; if a downstream machine is heavily loaded, slightly delay a job that feeds it to allow for processing of a job that feeds a less loaded machine.
    4.  **Task Progress:** Prioritize jobs that are closer to completion or have already experienced significant delays.
    5.  **Resource Availability:** Simple availability check.
*   **Addressing Pathologies:**
    *   **Bottlenecks:** Prioritizes jobs that keep bottlenecks busy with valuable work, considering setups.
    *   **Tardiness:** Incorporates due dates and urgency directly into dispatching.
    *   **Setups:** Explicitly factors in setup costs.
    *   **Starvation:** Indirectly addressed by considering downstream load.
*   **Expected Impact:** Reduced tardiness, better WIP management, improved machine utilization, more predictable lead times.

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Machine Learning and Simulation Integration**

*   **Core Logic:** Build machine learning models on historical data (from process mining) to predict:
    *   **Task Durations:** Beyond simple averages, use models that consider job complexity, operator skill (if data permits), machine history, and time of day/shift.
    *   **Setup Times:** Develop more granular setup time models based on specific job characteristics and machine states.
    *   **Machine Breakdowns:** Implement predictive maintenance models to forecast potential failures.
    *   **Flow Times:** Predict the likely completion time for jobs based on their current state and the current shop floor load.
*   **Process Mining Insights Used:**
    *   **Historical Task/Setup Durations:** The raw material for ML model training.
    *   **Resource Performance Patterns:** To identify machines prone to issues.
    *   **Disruption Timestamps and Durations:** To train ML models for failure prediction.
    *   **Job Routing Variations:** To understand how deviations impact overall duration.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Data Preparation:** Use process mining to extract features (e.g., job characteristics, sequence history, operator IDs, time of day) and target variables (actual task duration, setup duration, time until next breakdown).
    2.  **Model Training:** Train regression models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) for duration prediction and classification/survival models for breakdown prediction.
    3.  **Scheduling Engine:** Integrate these predictions into a scheduling optimizer. The optimizer can then generate schedules that are more robust to variability and proactively avoid predicted issues. For instance, it might schedule a maintenance task *before* a predicted breakdown on a critical machine or reroute a job if a downstream bottleneck is predicted to be overloaded.
*   **Addressing Pathologies:**
    *   **Unpredictable Lead Times:** Directly tackles this by providing more accurate estimates.
    *   **Inefficient Resource Utilization:** Minimizes downtime by predicting breakdowns and optimizes sequencing based on predicted durations and setups.
    *   **Tardiness:** Improved accuracy in predictions leads to more realistic and achievable schedules.
*   **Expected Impact:** Significant reduction in tardiness and lead time variability, higher resource utilization, fewer disruptions due to proactive maintenance scheduling, and more accurate customer promises.

**Strategy 3: Setup-Aware Dynamic Batching and Sequencing Optimization**

*   **Core Logic:** Proactively group jobs that require similar setups on bottleneck machines or sequences of machines to minimize total setup time across a planning horizon. This goes beyond immediate dispatching to look at medium-term scheduling.
*   **Process Mining Insights Used:**
    *   **Setup Time Matrix (Crucial):** This identifies which job transitions incur the longest setup times.
    *   **Job Arrival & Processing Data:** Understanding the inflow of jobs and their routings to identify opportunities for batching.
    *   **Bottleneck Identification:** Focus optimization efforts on machines identified as bottlenecks.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Identify Bottleneck Machines:** From process mining analysis.
    2.  **Analyze Machine-Specific Setup Matrices:** Understand the setup costs between different job types (e.g., based on material, finishing requirements, tool sets).
    3.  **Batching Algorithm:** Develop an algorithm that considers:
        *   **Job Due Dates:** Ensure batching doesn't cause critical jobs to be excessively delayed.
        *   **Capacity Constraints:** Ensure batches fit within available machine time.
        *   **Routing Compatibility:** Group jobs that share common downstream operations.
        *   **Setup Cost Reduction:** The primary driver; aim to group jobs with minimal setup transitions.
    4.  **Sequencing within Batches:** Once batches are formed, use advanced sequencing algorithms (e.g., Traveling Salesperson Problem variations or Mixed-Integer Programming if complex) to order jobs within the batch for optimal flow.
*   **Addressing Pathologies:**
    *   **Suboptimal Sequencing:** Directly addresses this by creating intelligent batches and sequences.
    *   **High Setup Times:** Significantly reduces total setup time by grouping similar jobs.
    *   **WIP:** Can help smooth WIP by processing jobs in larger, efficient chunks, but needs careful balancing to avoid excessive WIP accumulation for the batch.
*   **Expected Impact:** Dramatic reduction in setup times on critical machines, leading to increased throughput and potentially lower WIP if batches are managed efficiently. This can free up capacity on bottlenecks for more value-adding processing.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

**Simulation for Evaluation:**

Discrete-event simulation is essential for testing these new strategies without risking shop floor disruption. Process mining data provides the rich, realistic input parameters for these simulations:

*   **Input Data:**
    *   **Process Models:** Actual routings, task sequences.
    *   **Task Durations:** Distributions (mean, variance, shape) for each task on each resource, potentially including ML-predicted variability.
    *   **Setup Times:** Transition matrices derived from historical data.
    *   **Machine Availability:** MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) and MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) for each machine, derived from breakdown logs.
    *   **Job Arrival Processes:** Statistical distributions of job arrivals, priorities, and due dates.
    *   **Operator Availability:** Shift patterns, skill availability.
*   **Scenarios to Test:**
    *   **Baseline:** Simulate the current dispatching rules.
    *   **Strategy 1 (Enhanced Dispatching):** Test the proposed adaptive rules.
    *   **Strategy 2 (Predictive):** Simulate schedules generated by the ML-driven predictive system.
    *   **Strategy 3 (Batching):** Test schedules that incorporate dynamic batching.
    *   **Stress Tests:** Simulate scenarios with higher job arrival rates, increased breakdown frequencies, or a surge of urgent jobs to evaluate robustness.
    *   **Capacity Changes:** Simulate the impact of adding/removing machines or operators.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** For each simulated scenario and strategy, we would measure:
    *   On-Time Delivery Rate
    *   Average and Maximum Tardiness
    *   Average WIP Levels
    *   Average Job Lead Time
    *   Machine Utilization Rates (overall and for bottleneck machines)
    *   Total Setup Time
    *   Throughput

By comparing these metrics across simulations, we can quantitatively assess which strategy performs best for Precision Parts Inc.'s specific operational context before implementation.

**Continuous Improvement Framework:**

1.  **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement the chosen advanced scheduling strategy and continuously feed MES data into a real-time analytics platform.
2.  **Ongoing Process Mining:** Periodically (e.g., weekly or monthly), re-run process mining on new data. This will:
    *   **Detect Process Drift:** Identify if actual process execution starts deviating from the patterns learned for the scheduling strategy.
    *   **Identify New Bottlenecks/Inefficiencies:** Highlight emerging issues not covered by the current strategy.
    *   **Update Data Models:** Refresh historical duration distributions, setup matrices, and failure rates as new data becomes available.
3.  **Performance KPI Tracking:** Continuously monitor the key performance indicators (tardiness, WIP, utilization, etc.) against targets.
4.  **Feedback Loop to Scheduling Logic:**
    *   **Automated Alerting:** Set up alerts for significant deviations in KPIs or detected process drifts.
    *   **Machine Learning Model Retraining:** Periodically retrain ML models with the latest data to maintain prediction accuracy.
    *   **Rule Tuning:** If a specific dispatching rule is consistently underperforming or causing issues, re-evaluate its parameters or weighting based on the latest process mining insights.
    *   **Simulation Re-evaluation:** If significant changes occur (e.g., new machine, major process modification), re-run simulations with updated parameters.
5.  **Scheduled Review and Strategy Refinement:** Conduct regular (e.g., quarterly) formal reviews of the scheduling performance and the effectiveness of the deployed strategy. Use these reviews to make strategic adjustments to the scheduling algorithms or parameters, fostering a culture of continuous operational improvement.

By integrating process mining at every stage – from initial analysis to ongoing monitoring and refinement – Precision Parts Inc. can transform its scheduling from a reactive, rule-based function into a proactive, data-driven, and continuously optimized operational capability, ultimately resolving their critical performance challenges.
