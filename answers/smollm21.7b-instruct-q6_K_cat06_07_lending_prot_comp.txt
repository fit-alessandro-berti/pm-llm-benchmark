Based on your provided data, I can identify some key differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups:

1. **Frequency of Loan Denial**: The protected group has a significantly higher frequency of loan denials (960 times) compared to the unprotected group (2709 times). This suggests that there may be a bias in favor of approving loans for protected individuals, possibly due to factors like more lenient underwriting criteria or lower risk assessment.

2. **Performance Metrics**: Both groups have high performance metrics (denial frequency and submission rates), which indicates a consistent pattern of disapprovals and successful loan submissions across both groups. However, the protected group's denial rate is roughly 4 times higher than the unprotected group's.

3. **Borrowers Information Submission**: The unprotected group has an exceptionally high frequency of submitting borrowers information (1656 times) compared to the protected group (664 times). This could indicate that there are more opportunities for errors or inconsistencies in the handling of borrower information during the approval process, potentially leading to increased denial rates.

4. **Loan Approval Rates**: The unprotected group has a significantly higher loan approval rate (38% vs 5%) compared to the protected group (6%). This suggests that there might be biases in the decision-making process, with the protected group being less likely to be approved for loans.

These differences suggest potential biases and areas for improvement in the lending process, including:

1. More stringent underwriting criteria for the protected group.
2. Enhanced documentation or verification processes for borrower information submission in the unprotected group.
3. Investigation of factors contributing to increased denial rates in the protected group, such as inconsistent application data or biases in decision-making processes.
4. Consideration of alternative lending options or products that better serve protected individuals.

These findings should be further explored and analyzed through statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns and trends within the data.
