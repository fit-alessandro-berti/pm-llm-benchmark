### BPMN-Like Process Model

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval Workflow

**Activities/Tasks:**
1. **Invoice Reception by Accounts Payable (Mary):** Receive an invoice via email.
2. **Verification of Purchase Order (PO) Number (Mary):** Check if the invoice is associated with a valid PO number.
   - **Decision Point:** If PO not found, contact supplier for details; if found, log into accounting system and send to purchasing department.
3. **Confirmation from Purchasing Department (Dan):** Log the invoice in accounting system after confirming receipt of goods through PO.
4. **Match Invoice Line Items with PO (Mary):** Compare quantities, prices, and delivery charges against those on the PO.
   - **Decision Point:** If mismatch found, contact purchasing department to resolve; if match confirmed, send confirmation email back to AP.
5. **Approval by Department Manager (Carlos):**
   - Receive notification from AP indicating that everything is correct regarding PO number.
   - Approve invoice after confirming receipt of goods and matching line items with the PO.
6. **Escalation for Exceptions/Rejections (Mary or Rita):** If discrepancies are found, escalate to Mary or Rita for resolution.
7. **Confirmation of Approval by Manager (Carlos):**
   - Receive approval from Department Manager on invoice; consider exceptions if necessary.
8. **Scheduling Payment:**
   - Confirm and schedule the payment run after all approvals.

**Sequence Flow:**
- After receiving an invoice, check PO number in step 2.
- If PO not found, contact supplier for details (Decision Point).
- Log into accounting system and send to purchasing department (Step 3).
- Compare quantities, prices, delivery charges against those on the PO (Step 4).
- Confirm receipt of goods from purchasing department; if yes, send confirmation email back to AP (Step 5).
- Receive notification from AP indicating correct PO number (Decision Point); approve invoice after confirming receipt and matching line items with the PO (Steps 6-7).
- If discrepancies found, escalate to Mary or Rita for resolution (Decision Point).
- Confirm approval by Manager on invoice (Decision Point).
- Schedule payment run after all approvals.

**Gateways/Decision Points:**
1. **Verification of PO Number:** When checking the PO number in step 2.
2. **Confirmation from Purchasing Department:** After receiving confirmation regarding receipt of goods and matching line items with the PO (Steps 3, 5).
3. **Escalation for Exceptions:** If discrepancies are found during verification or comparison steps.

**Roles/Participants:**
- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary): Receives invoices, logs them into accounting system, sends to purchasing department.
- Purchasing Officer (Dan): Verifies invoice details against PO; confirms receipt of goods.
- Department Manager (Carlos): Approves final confirmation and schedules payment run.
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita): Handles exceptions and ensures problems don’t get stuck in the system.

**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
- **Invoices:** Data objects representing the received invoices, including PO numbers and details of goods or services purchased.
- **POs:** Document containing the purchase orders referenced by each invoice.
- **Pricing Contracts:** Documents defining agreed-upon prices for contracted items.
- **Payment Runs:** Scheduled processes in accounting system to process approved invoices.

**Exceptions/Variations:**
- Incomplete PO numbers can trigger escalation (Decision Point 2).
- Discrepancies between invoice details and PO need manual resolution (Step 5).
- Suppliers may contact AP or Purchasing directly about issues (Steps 1, 8).
- Department heads might create a retrospective PO for informal services (Activity 6).

This BPMN-like model captures the typical workflow, decision points, responsibilities, artifacts, and exceptions identified through interviews.
