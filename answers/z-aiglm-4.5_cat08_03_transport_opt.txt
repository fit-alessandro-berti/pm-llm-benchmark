### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

#### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**
To create a cohesive event log, I would integrate data from GPS trackers, driver scanners, dispatch systems, and maintenance logs using a **unified case ID** (e.g., `Vehicle-Day`). Key steps include:
- **Synchronization:** Align timestamps across sources using UTC and resolve discrepancies via interpolation (e.g., GPS coordinates for scanner events) or outlier detection.
- **Activity Mapping:** Standardize activity names (e.g., "Depart Depot" from GPS and "Depart Customer" from scanners) and enrich context (e.g., link "Low Speed Detected" to traffic delays using location/time).
- **Attribute Fusion:** Combine attributes like `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Package ID`, and `Location` into a single log. For missing data (e.g., no GPS during a stop), use scanner timestamps or maintenance logs.
- **Case Definition:** Define `Case ID` as `Vehicle-Day` to track each vehicle’s daily journey. Link packages to cases via `Package ID` in scanner events.

**Challenges:**
- **Granularity Mismatch:** GPS data (high-frequency) vs. scanner events (low-frequency) requires aggregation (e.g., averaging speed between stops).
- **Data Gaps:** Missing GPS signals (e.g., tunnels) or scanner events (e.g., forgotten scans) need imputation or flagging.
- **Semantic Alignment:** Activities like "Unscheduled Stop" (maintenance) vs. "Delivery Failed" (customer issue) must be clearly distinguished.
- **Volume:** Six months of high-frequency GPS data may require sampling or cloud-based processing.

#### **Process Discovery**
Using **Inductive Miner** or **Heuristics Miner**, I would visualize the end-to-end delivery process:
- **Start/End Events:** "Start Shift" to "End Shift."
- **Core Activities:** Depot departure, travel, delivery attempts (success/fail), depot return.
- **Deviations:** Include "Low Speed Detected," "Unscheduled Stop," and overtime logs.
- **Output:** A process model showing:
  - **Happy Path:** Depot  Travel  Arrive Customer  Delivery Success  Depart  Repeat  Return Depot.
  - **Variants:** Paths with failed deliveries, maintenance stops, or traffic delays (e.g., 20% of cases include "Unscheduled Stop").

#### **Conformance Checking**
Compare the discovered model against dispatch plans using **token-based replay**:
- **Sequence Deviations:** Check if drivers follow the planned stop sequence (e.g., Stop 1 before Stop 2). Detect skips or reordering.
- **Unplanned Stops:** Identify "Unscheduled Stop" or prolonged idling (from GPS) not in dispatch plans.
- **Timing Differences:** Measure gaps between planned vs. actual:
  - **Travel Time:** Actual vs. estimated time between stops (e.g., +30% due to traffic).
  - **Service Time:** Actual vs. planned time at customer locations.
- **Metrics:** 
  - **Fitness:** % of planned activities executed (e.g., 85% if many failed deliveries).
  - **Precision:** % of actual activities covered by the plan (e.g., 70% if many unplanned stops).

**Key Deviations:** 
- Routes with frequent sequence changes (e.g., drivers skipping stops to meet deadlines).
- Time windows violated due to traffic or long service times.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
| KPI                          | Calculation from Event Log                                                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate**    | (# "Delivery Success" within customer time window) / (Total Deliveries)                     |
| **Avg. Time per Delivery Stop** | ("Depart Customer" – "Arrive Customer") for successful deliveries; aggregated by location/driver. |
| **Travel vs. Service Time Ratio** | Total Travel Time (between stops) / Total Service Time (at stops)                          |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/package** | (Total Distance from GPS × Fuel Rate) / # Packages Delivered                               |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | (Total Operational Time – Idle Time) / (Shift Duration)                                    |
| **Traffic Delay Frequency/Duration** | # "Low Speed Detected" events (speed < 10 km/h) with duration > 5 mins.                   |
| **Failed Delivery Rate**     | (# "Delivery Failed") / (Total Delivery Attempts)                                          |

#### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques**
- **Performance Overlays:** Visualize KPIs (e.g., travel time) on the process model. Red paths indicate bottlenecks.
- **Variant Analysis:** Group traces by attributes (e.g., driver, route) to compare KPIs:
  - **Example:** Drivers with Avg. Service Time > 8 mins vs. < 5 mins.
- **Time-Series Analysis:** Correlate delays with time of day (e.g., 8–10 AM traffic hotspots).
- **Spatial Analysis:** Map GPS locations of "Low Speed Detected" events to identify congestion zones.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Break down service time into sub-activities (e.g., parking, delivery) using GPS/scanner gaps.

**Bottleneck Types:**
- **Route-Specific:** Long travel times on highways (e.g., Route A takes 40% longer than planned).
- **Time-Based:** Morning rush hour causing 25% of delays.
- **Activity-Specific:** "Arrive Customer" to "Delivery Success" takes 12 mins in apartments vs. 5 mins in houses.
- **Driver-Based:** Driver D105 has 30% higher failed delivery rate than peers.

**Impact Quantification:** 
- A traffic hotspot causing 15-min delays affects 10% of deliveries, reducing OTDR by 5%.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

#### **Potential Root Causes**
- **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Static routes ignore real-time traffic.
- **Inaccurate Time Estimations:** Dispatch underestimates travel/service times.
- **Traffic Congestion:** Recurring delays at peak times/locations.
- **Service Time Variability:** Parking difficulties (e.g., urban areas) or customer interactions.
- **Vehicle Breakdowns:** Unscheduled stops causing cascading delays.
- **Driver Behavior:** Inefficient routing or extended service times.
- **Failed Deliveries:** Customer absence or address issues.

#### **Process Mining Analyses for Validation**
- **Variant Comparison:** 
  - **High-Performing Routes:** Short travel times, high OTDR. 
  - **Low-Performing Routes:** Include traffic delays or failed deliveries. 
  *Insight:* High-performing routes avoid highways at 8 AM.
- **Traffic-Delay Correlation:** 
  - Overlay "Low Speed Detected" events with travel times. 
  *Insight:* 70% of delays correlate with GPS-identified traffic zones.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** 
  - Compare service times by location type (e.g., apartments vs. suburbs). 
  *Insight:* Apartments have 2x longer service times due to parking.
- **Maintenance Impact:** 
  - Analyze cases with "Unscheduled Stop" vs. without. 
  *Insight:* Breakdowns increase shift duration by 2 hours and reduce deliveries by 15%.
- **Driver Performance Clustering:** 
  - Group drivers by KPIs (e.g., OTDR, service time). 
  *Insight:* Top drivers follow planned sequences and have minimal idle time.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** Traffic delays and suboptimal routes.
- **Root Cause:** Static routing ignores real-time conditions.
- **Process Mining Insights:** GPS data shows recurring traffic hotspots; conformance checks reveal 30% of routes deviate from plans due to congestion.
- **Proposal:** Implement AI-driven routing that integrates real-time traffic data (GPS + external APIs) to reroute drivers dynamically. Prioritize stops based on time windows and historical delays.
- **Expected Impact:** 
  - **OTDR:** +15% (by avoiding delays). 
  - **Fuel Consumption:** -10% (shorter distances). 
  - **Travel Time:** -20%.

#### **Strategy 2: Territory and Sequence Optimization**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** Long travel times and high variability in driver performance.
- **Root Cause:** Territories are poorly balanced; stop sequences don’t minimize travel.
- **Process Mining Insights:** Variant analysis shows drivers in Zone A deliver 20% more packages/hour than Zone B. Travel time/service time ratio is 3:1 (ideal: 2:1).
- **Proposal:** Redesign territories using clustering (stops with similar service times/patterns) and optimize sequences via the Traveling Salesman Problem (historical data). Assign high-performing drivers to high-variability zones.
- **Expected Impact:** 
  - **Avg. Time per Stop:** -25%. 
  - **Vehicle Utilization:** +18%. 
  - **Failed Deliveries:** -12% (better time management).

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance and Time Window Refinement**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** Unscheduled breakdowns and failed deliveries.
- **Root Cause:** Reactive maintenance and broad time windows.
- **Process Mining Insights:** Maintenance logs show 40% of breakdowns occur after 100 operational hours. Failed deliveries peak at 3–5 PM when customers are unavailable.
- **Proposal:** 
  - **Predictive Maintenance:** Use vehicle usage patterns (e.g., GPS mileage, idle hours) to schedule maintenance before failures. 
  - **Time Window Optimization:** Narrow windows based on historical success rates (e.g., 10–12 AM slots have 90% success vs. 60% for 2–4 PM). Add SMS alerts for customers.
- **Expected Impact:** 
  - **Unscheduled Stops:** -70%. 
  - **Failed Delivery Rate:** -30%. 
  - **Fuel Costs:** -8% (efficient vehicle use).

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

#### **Operational Constraints**
- **Driver Hours:** Dynamic routing must respect legal limits (e.g., 8-hour shifts). Optimization algorithms should cap daily assignments and flag overtime risks.
- **Vehicle Capacities:** Route redesign ensures loads don’t exceed capacity (e.g., max 50 packages/van). Use package data from dispatch to validate.
- **Customer Time Windows:** All strategies prioritize on-time delivery within windows. Dynamic routing adjusts only if delays threaten compliance.

#### **Continuous Monitoring Plan**
- **Process Mining Dashboards:** 
  - **Performance View:** Track OTDR, Avg. Time per Stop, and Fuel Consumption daily. 
  - **Bottleneck View:** Heatmaps of traffic hotspots and service time outliers. 
  - **Conformance View:** % of routes adhering to plans and deviation alerts. 
  - **Driver/Vehicle View:** KPI comparisons and maintenance schedules.
- **Alerts:** 
  - Real-time notifications for OTDR < 90%, traffic delays > 15 mins, or unscheduled stops.
- **Review Cadence:** 
  - **Weekly:** Analyze KPI trends and emerging bottlenecks (e.g., new traffic zones). 
  - **Monthly:** Re-optimize territories/routes using updated data.
- **Sustainability Metrics:** 
  - Monitor fuel efficiency, vehicle downtime, and driver overtime to ensure long-term viability.

**Outcome:** This approach transforms Speedy Parcels into a data-driven operation, reducing costs by 15–20% and improving OTDR by 20% within six months.
