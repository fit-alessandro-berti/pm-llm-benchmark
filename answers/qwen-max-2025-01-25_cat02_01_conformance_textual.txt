### Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process

The normative process description outlines two main paths for handling orders: one for sufficient inventory (fulfillment path) and one for insufficient inventory (cancellation path). Each path has a strict sequence of activities, with specific constraints on when certain activities can occur. Let us analyze each case in the event log to identify deviations.

### **Case 1**
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-05 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-05 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-05 11:00    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-05 12:00    | Package items      |
| 2023-10-05 13:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-05 14:00    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- The sequence follows the fulfillment path: "Receive order"  "Check inventory"  "Authorize payment"  "Package items"  "Ship order"  "Close order."
- All activities occur in the correct order as per the normative process.
- **No violations.**

### **Case 2**
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-06 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-06 09:30    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-06 10:00    | Package items      |
| 2023-10-06 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-06 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-06 11:30    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- The activity "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment," which violates the normative process.
  - According to the description, "Authorize payment" must occur before "Package items" because payment authorization is a prerequisite for packaging.
- **Violation:** Packaging items before payment authorization.

### **Case 3**
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-07 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-07 09:20    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-07 09:40    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-07 10:00    | Cancel order       |
| 2023-10-07 10:30    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-07 11:00    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- After "Cancel order," the activity "Ship order" occurs, which violates the normative process.
  - According to the description, once an order is canceled, it should proceed directly to "Close order." Shipping after cancellation is illogical and violates the process.
- **Violation:** Shipping an order after it has been canceled.

### **Case 4**
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-08 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-08 09:10    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-08 09:20    | Cancel order       |
| 2023-10-08 09:50    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- The sequence follows the cancellation path: "Receive order"  "Check inventory"  "Cancel order"  "Close order."
- All activities occur in the correct order as per the normative process.
- **No violations.**

### **Case 5**
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-09 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-09 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-09 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-09 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-09 11:30    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- The sequence skips the "Package items" activity entirely, proceeding directly from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order."
  - According to the description, "Package items" must occur before "Ship order" because items must be prepared for shipment.
- **Violation:** Shipping without packaging.
