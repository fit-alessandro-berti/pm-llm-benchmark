To identify the main differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group, I will analyze the provided data and apply domain knowledge.

**1. Access to Thorough Examination:**
The protected group has a lower frequency of Thorough Examination, especially when compared to the unprotected group. For example, in the protected group, only 130 patients (Register at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge) and 112 patients (Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge) underwent Thorough Examination, whereas in the unprotected group, 656, 604, and 592 patients (Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge, Register at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge, and Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge, respectively) underwent Thorough Examination. This suggests that the protected group may have had limited access to Thorough Examination.

**2. Treatment Unsuccessful:**
The protected group has a higher frequency of treatment unsuccessful cases, especially when compared to the unprotected group. For example, in the protected group, 61 patients (Register at ER -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Discharge) and 50 patients (Register at ER -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge) had treatment unsuccessful, whereas in the unprotected group, only 30 and 29 patients (Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge and Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge, respectively) had treatment unsuccessful. This suggests that the protected group may have had a higher rate of treatment unsuccessful.

**3. Discharge without Treatment:**
The protected group has a higher frequency of Discharge without Treatment, especially when compared to the unprotected group. For example, in the protected group, 158 patients (Register at ER) and 156 patients (Register at FD) were discharged without treatment, whereas in the unprotected group, only 505 patients (Discharge) were discharged without treatment.

**4. Long-term Treatment:**
The protected group has a higher frequency of long-term treatment, especially when compared to the unprotected group. For example, in the protected group, 48 patients (Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment
