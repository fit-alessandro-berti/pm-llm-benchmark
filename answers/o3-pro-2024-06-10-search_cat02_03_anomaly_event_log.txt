Below is a brief reminder of the “text-book” Procure-to-Pay (P2P) order of events; anything that departs from this sequence is a red flag unless the company has an explicit, well-controlled exception procedure.

1. Create Purchase Requisition (PR)  
2. Approve PR  
3. Issue Purchase Order (PO) to the supplier  
4. Receive Goods / Services (Goods Receipt, GR)  
5. Receive Vendor Invoice  
6. 3-way match (PO × GR × Invoice)  
7. Release / Execute Payment  
8. Close the case

Case-by-case analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------

Case 1001 – “Happy path” (no anomaly)  
The activities follow the standard order: PR  approval  PO  GR  invoice  match  payment  close.  
• Controls (approval, 3-way match) take place before money leaves the company.  
• Nothing appears problematic.

Case 1002 – Multiple control breakdowns  

Observed order (simplified):  
PR (creation)  PO  Invoice  Payment  PR approval  GR  Match  Close

Why it is anomalous / risky  
1. PO issued before the PR is approved  
   • Bypasses the budget/authority check that the approval step provides.  
2. Invoice received and payment released before:  
   • the PR is approved,  
   • goods are received, and  
   • the 3-way match is executed.  
   Paying early eliminates the company’s main safeguard against over-billing, wrong quantities, or undelivered goods.  
3. Payment occurs only 15 minutes after the invoice is logged, suggesting an override of normal paymentrun schedules or an emergency/“manual” payment—both often scrutinized by auditors.  

Possible business impact: unauthorized spend, loss of cash-flow leverage, increased risk of fraud or duplicate payment, SOX/internal-control violation.

Case 1003 – Payment released before any supporting documents  

Observed order:  
PR  approval  PO  Payment  Invoice  GR  Match  Close

Anomalies  
1. Payment is released six days after the PO but one day before the invoice is even recorded and two days before the goods are received.  
2. The 3-way match happens after cash has already left the company, nullifying its preventive-control purpose.  
3. Receiving the invoice after payment is inherently suspicious—normally the invoice is the legal trigger for liability and payment terms.  

Potential consequences: over-payment, payment for goods that never arrive, or facilitation of fictitious-vendor fraud.

Case 1004 – Goods received before a Purchase Order exists  

Observed order:  
PR  approval  GR  PO  Invoice  Match  Payment  Close

Why it stands out  
1. Goods Receipt precedes the PO (and therefore any formal commitment to buy). This is characteristic of:  
   • “Maverick” or off-contract buying,  
   • emergency purchases booked retroactively, or  
   • poor discipline in raising purchase orders.  
2. Although invoice, match, and payment are later performed in the correct order, the late PO means:  
   • The supplier delivered without an approved commercial document, weakening price/terms enforcement.  
   • The company’s spend data and budget commitments were inaccurate until after receipt.  

----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of detected anomalies

• Case 1002 – PO before approval; payment before GR, invoice-matching, or even PR approval.  
• Case 1003 – Payment before invoice and before any receipt; 3-way match is rendered ineffective.  
• Case 1004 – Goods received before a PO is issued (retroactive or maverick buying).  

Such sequences break key internal controls (segregation of duties, approval hierarchies, and the 3-way match), expose the organization to financial loss and audit findings, and indicate process weaknesses that should be investigated and remediated.
