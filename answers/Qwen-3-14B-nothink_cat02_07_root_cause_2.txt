### **1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Completion Times**

We'll calculate the **total duration** of each case by subtracting the **start time** (Submit Claim) from the **end time** (Close Claim).

#### **Case 2001:**
- Start: 2024-04-01 09:00  
- End: 2024-04-01 10:30  
- **Duration:** 1 hour 30 minutes

#### **Case 2002:**
- Start: 2024-04-01 09:05  
- End: 2024-04-02 11:00  
- **Duration:** 26 hours 55 minutes

#### **Case 2003:**
- Start: 2024-04-01 09:10  
- End: 2024-04-03 09:30  
- **Duration:** 48 hours 20 minutes

#### **Case 2004:**
- Start: 2024-04-01 09:20  
- End: 2024-04-01 10:45  
- **Duration:** 1 hour 25 minutes

#### **Case 2005:**
- Start: 2024-04-01 09:25  
- End: 2024-04-04 14:30  
- **Duration:** 71 hours 5 minutes

### **Conclusion on Long Cases:**
- **Case 2002:** 26 hours 55 minutes  
- **Case 2003:** 48 hours 20 minutes  
- **Case 2005:** 71 hours 5 minutes  

These **three cases** are significantly longer than the others and are considered to have **performance issues**.

### **2. Analyze Attributes to Determine Root Causes**

We'll now examine the **Resource**, **Region**, and **Complexity** attributes for the long-duration cases.

---

#### **Case 2002:**
- **Resource:** CSR_Paul, Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Ann, Finance_Carl  
- **Region:** B  
- **Complexity:** Medium  
- **Key Events:**
  - Request for additional documents occurred **5.5 hours** after the claim was evaluated.
  - Approval was delayed for **15.5 hours** after the request was made.

**Observations:**
- This case involved **medium complexity** but had a **delay in the approval stage**, possibly due to:
  - **Resource workload** (Adjuster_Lisa and Finance_Carl may be overburdened).
  - **Region B** might have a slower processing time.

---

#### **Case 2003:**
- **Resource:** CSR_Jane, Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Bill, Finance_Alan  
- **Region:** A  
- **Complexity:** High  
- **Key Events:**
  - **Two requests for additional documents** (total of 11 hours between requests).
  - Approval was delayed for **17 hours** after the last document request.
  - Final payment and closure took **3 hours** after approval.

**Observations:**
- **High complexity** led to **multiple requests for additional documents**.
- Adjuster_Mike appears to be the one requesting documents, which may indicate:
  - **Inefficiency in initial evaluation** (did not gather enough info at first).
  - **High workload** on Adjuster_Mike, leading to repeated requests.

---

#### **Case 2005:**
- **Resource:** CSR_Paul, Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Bill, Finance_Carl  
- **Region:** B  
- **Complexity:** High  
- **Key Events:**
  - **Three requests for additional documents** (total of 20 hours between requests).
  - Approval was delayed for **19 hours** after the last document request.

**Observations:**
- **High complexity** and **multiple requests for documents** significantly extended the case.
- Adjuster_Lisa appears to be the one requesting documents, which may indicate:
  - **Inconsistent evaluation process** (not gathering enough information upfront).
  - **Resource overload** on Adjuster_Lisa and Manager_Bill, leading to delays.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis and Mitigation Suggestions**

#### **Root Causes:**

| Root Cause | Affected Cases | Evidence |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **High complexity** | 2003, 2005 | Multiple requests for additional documents |
| **Multiple document requests** | 2003, 2005 | Indicate inefficient evaluation or incomplete initial data |
| **Resource overload** | 2002, 2003, 2005 | Same resources (Adjuster_Lisa, Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Bill) involved in multiple long cases |
| **Region B processing delays** | 2002, 2005 | Cases from Region B take longer than Region A |
| **Inconsistent evaluation** | 2003, 2005 | Adjusters requesting multiple documents may be due to poor initial assessment |

---

### **4. Suggestions for Mitigation**

1. **Improve Initial Evaluation:**
   - Train adjusters to ensure they gather all necessary information during the **Evaluate Claim** step.
   - Implement checklists or AI tools to flag missing documents early in the process.

2. **Resource Allocation and Workload Balancing:**
   - Monitor resource workloads (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa, Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Bill).
   - Distribute high-complexity cases more evenly across resources or assign dedicated teams to complex claims.

3. **Region-Specific Process Optimization:**
   - Investigate why Region B is slower (e.g., infrastructure, communication, or resource allocation).
   - Provide additional support or tools to teams in Region B.

4. **Automate Document Requests:**
   - Use automation to flag missing documents during the initial evaluation.
   - Reduce the need for manual requests, which slow down the process.

5. **Implement Real-Time Monitoring:**
   - Use process mining tools to monitor case durations and identify bottlenecks in real time.
   - Set up alerts for cases that take longer than a predefined threshold.

---

### **Final Summary**

- **Long cases:** 2002, 2003, and 2005.
- **Root causes:** High complexity, multiple document requests, resource overload, and Region B delays.
- **Mitigation:** Improve evaluation quality, balance workloads, optimize Region B processes, and automate document requests.
