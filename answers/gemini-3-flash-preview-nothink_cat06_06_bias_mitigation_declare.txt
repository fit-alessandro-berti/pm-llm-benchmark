To mitigate potential bias in the loan application review process, I have updated the DECLARE model to include activities and constraints that enforce human oversight, mandatory mitigation steps, and the prevention of "gut-reaction" decisions based on sensitive attributes.

### Updated DECLARE Model

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "FinalDecision": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "ManualReview": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "alt_response": {},
    "alt_precedence": {},
    "alt_succession": {},
    "chain_response": {},
    "chain_precedence": {},
    "chain_succession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {
            "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    }
}
```

### Rationale for Bias-Mitigating Constraints

1.  **Existence (`BiasMitigationCheck` & `ManualReview`):**
    By adding these to the `existence` dictionary, we mandate that every process instance must include a bias check and a human-in-the-loop review. This ensures that the process doesn't bypass safety protocols.

2.  **Precedence (`BiasMitigationCheck` -> `FinalDecision`):**
    This constraint ensures that a `FinalDecision` cannot be reached unless a `BiasMitigationCheck` has occurred beforehand. It prevents the system from skipping the fairness evaluation during the decision-making phase.

3.  **Coexistence (`FinalDecision` <-> `ManualReview`):**
    To prevent automated-only rejections or approvals that might hide algorithmic bias, this constraint mandates that if a `FinalDecision` is made, a `ManualReview` must also occur in the same trace (and vice-versa). This ensures human accountability for the final outcome.

4.  **Responded Existence (`CheckSensitiveAttributes` -> `BiasMitigationCheck`):**
    If the process involves an activity where sensitive data is accessed (`CheckSensitiveAttributes`), this constraint forces the `BiasMitigationCheck` to be present in the trace. This ensures that the disclosure of sensitive data *triggers* a fairness review.

5.  **Non-chain Succession (`CheckSensitiveAttributes` !-> `FinalDecision`):**
    This is a critical fairness constraint. It prevents a `FinalDecision` from occurring *immediately* after `CheckSensitiveAttributes`. By prohibiting this direct sequence, we ensure the process cannot make a "snap judgment" based solely on race, gender, or age without intermediary processing steps or reviews.
