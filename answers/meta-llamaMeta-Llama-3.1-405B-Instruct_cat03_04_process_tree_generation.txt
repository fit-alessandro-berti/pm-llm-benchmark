To implement a process tree in pm4py for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process, we first need to define the activities (leaves of the tree) and their relationships through operators (such as sequence, choice, concurrency, and loop). A Purchase-to-Pay process might involve the following steps:

1. **Create Purchase Order (PO)**: Always the first step.
2. **Send PO to Supplier**: Happens after creating the PO.
3. **Receive Goods**: Can happen before or after receiving the invoice, so these two steps are in concurrent.
4. **Receive Invoice**: Concurrent with receiving goods.
5. **Check Invoice and Goods Receipt**: Only after both goods and invoice are received.
6. **Pay Invoice**: Final step, after checking invoice and goods receipt.

However, for a more interesting and realistic model, let's introduce a loop to handle payment rejection and a choice for handling different payment methods:

1. **Create Purchase Order (PO)** -> 
2. **Send PO to Supplier** -> 
3. **+ (Receive Goods, Receive Invoice)** -> 
    Here we are using concurrency (+) for receiving goods and invoice.
4. **Check Invoice and Goods Receipt** -> 
5. **X (Pay by Bank Transfer, Pay by Credit Card)**: This introduces a choice between two payment methods.
6. If payment by bank transfer is chosen, there might be a loop to handle a rejected payment: 
    *\(Pay by Bank Transfer, Payment Rejected)\)*

Here is a Python code snippet using pm4py to create this process tree:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Root process tree with a sequence operator
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Create Purchase Order (PO) activity
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create Purchase Order", parent=root)
root.children.append(create_po)

# Send PO to Supplier activity in sequence
send_po = ProcessTree(label="Send PO to Supplier", parent=root)
root.children.append(send_po)

# Parallel operator for receiving goods and invoice
parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
root.children.append(parallel)

receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=parallel)
parallel.children.append(receive_goods)

receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive Invoice", parent=parallel)
parallel.children.append(receive_invoice)

# Sequence operator for checking and payment
seq_check_pay = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
