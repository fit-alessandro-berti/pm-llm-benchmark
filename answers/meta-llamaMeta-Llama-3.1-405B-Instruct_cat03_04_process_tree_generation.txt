Here is the Python code to implement a process tree for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using pm4py:
```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Create the root node
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Create the "Create Purchase Order" activity
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create Purchase Order", parent=root)
root.children.append(create_po)

# Create the "Approve Purchase Order" activity
approve_po = ProcessTree(label="Approve Purchase Order", parent=root)
root.children.append(approve_po)

# Create the "Send Purchase Order to Supplier" activity
send_po = ProcessTree(label="Send Purchase Order to Supplier", parent=root)
root.children.append(send_po)

# Create the "Receive Invoice" activity
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive Invoice", parent=root)
root.children.append(receive_invoice)

# Create the "Verify Invoice" activity
verify_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Verify Invoice", parent=root)
root.children.append(verify_invoice)

# Create the "Pay Invoice" activity
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay Invoice", parent=root)
root.children.append(pay_invoice)

# Create an exclusive choice between "Approve Payment" and "Reject Payment"
payment_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
approve_payment = ProcessTree(label="Approve Payment", parent=payment_choice)
reject_payment = ProcessTree(label="Reject Payment", parent=payment_choice)
payment_choice.children.append(approve_payment)
payment_choice.children.append(reject_payment)
root.children.append(payment_choice)

# Create a loop for handling payment rejection
payment_rejection_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=root)
payment_rejection_loop.children.append(reject_payment)
payment_rejection_loop.children.append(create_po)  # jump back to create PO
root.children.append(payment_rejection_loop)
```
This process tree represents the following Purchase-to-Pay process:

1. Create Purchase Order
2. Approve Purchase Order
3. Send Purchase Order to Supplier
4. Receive Invoice
5. Verify Invoice
6. Pay Invoice
7. Exclusive choice between:
	* Approve Payment
	* Reject Payment (loop back to Create Purchase Order)

Note that this is just one possible representation of a Purchase-to-Pay process, and you may need to adjust the process tree to fit your specific requirements.

Also, keep in mind that this code only creates the process tree structure, and does not include any actual process execution or simulation logic.
