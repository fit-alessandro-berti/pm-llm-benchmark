The visualization is a workflow/process model (similar to a Petri-net style diagram) for handling a request or ticket.

- **Activities (rounded boxes) labeled a–z** with text descriptions:
  - **a:** register request  
  - **b:** examine thoroughly  
  - **c:** examine casually  
  - **d:** check ticket  
  - **f:** reinitiate request (loop-back step)  
  - **e:** decide  
  - **g:** pay compensation  
  - **h:** reject request  
  - **z:** end

- **Flow/structure:**
  - The process starts at **a (register request)** and can branch into different examination/checking steps (**b, c, d**) with possible looping via **f (reinitiate request)**.
  - These paths converge into **e (decide)**.
  - After the decision, the process branches to either **g (pay compensation)** or **h (reject request)**, and both lead to **z (end)**.

- **Black dots and arrows** indicate control-flow points and direction of progression; multiple dots near a task show where the flow splits/joins.

- **Inset legend (bottom right):** illustrates the meaning of different split/join patterns:
  - **XOR-split / XOR-join** (exclusive choice / exclusive merge)
  - **AND-split / AND-join** (parallel split / synchronization)
  - **OR-split / OR-join** (inclusive choice / inclusive merge)
