Looking just at the data you’ve provided, two nonfinancial attributes seem to be playing a role over and above the applicants’ underlying “PreliminaryScore”:

- Membership of “Highland Civic Darts Club” triggers a hardcoded +10 “Community” adjustment in the scoring engine, which carries through to the adjusted score used at decision time. In C001 and C004 that bump moves a 710 to 720 and a 690 to 700, respectively, and both are ultimately approved. Applicants with the same or higher preliminary scores but without that affiliation do not receive the bump.

- There is also a “LocalResident” flag on every case. Although there is no explicit adjustment shown for it, all of the approvals at the low end of the score range are for locals. The only rejection in this sample, C003, is a nonresident with a 715 preliminary score and no adjustment; a nonresident with a much stronger score (C005, 740) is approved. That pattern is consistent with either a tighter threshold for nonresidents or the “community” bump only being available to locals.

The effect of these design choices is that two people with similar creditworthiness can be treated differently. For example, C004’s 690 is boosted to 700 and approved because of club membership, while C003’s 715 is rejected with no adjustment. Applicants who are not members of the named group, or who are not local, have no way to earn the +10 and are held to a higher effective bar. If membership in a particular club or residency status correlates with ethnicity, socioeconomic status or other protected characteristics, embedding it in the scoring process will skew outcomes and undermine fairness and equity for those outside that circle.
