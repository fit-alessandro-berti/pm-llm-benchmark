Certainly! Here is a list of 20 relevant questions about the given process along with a confidence score for each question. The confidence score is based on the perceived importance and relevance of the questions considering the information provided:

1. **What is the average performance time for the entire process across all variants?**
   - **Confidence Score: 95%**

2. **Which process variant is the most frequently occurring?**
   - **Confidence Score: 98%**

3. **What is the average performance time for the most frequent process variant?**
   - **Confidence Score: 95%**

4. **How often does the 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' occur, and what are its consequences?**
   - **Confidence Score: 93%**

5. **What is the difference in performance time between the variants with and without rejection steps?**
   - **Confidence Score: 92%**

6. **Which steps in the process have the highest average performance time?**
   - **Confidence Score: 90%**

7. **What is the impact of having 'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER' on the performance time?**
   - **Confidence Score: 87%**

8. **How does the presence of 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' affect the overall process?**
   - **Confidence Score: 85%**

9. **Are there any specific reasons or conditions leading to multiple rejections (looping behavior)?**
   - **Confidence Score: 88%**

10. **What is the performance time variance between 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'?**
    - **Confidence Score: 82%**

11. **What improvements can be made to reduce the performance time for the variants with the highest performance times?**
    - **Confidence Score: 89%**

12. **How do the different roles (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER) impact the decision-making and performance times?**
    - **Confidence Score: 90%**

13. **What is the frequency of payment requests after the final approval step?**
    - **Confidence Score: 92%**

14. **Is there any correlation between the frequency of rejections and the process performance time?**
    - **Confidence Score: 94%**

15. **How does the frequency and performance of the process compare between 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled'?**
    - **Confidence Score: 85%**

16. **What are the root causes of the longest performance times identified in the process?**
    - **Confidence Score: 93%**

17. **How do redundant steps (such as repeated submissions and rejections) influence the frequency and performance?**
    - **Confidence Score: 91%**

18. **Are there opportunities for process automation, and if so, which steps should be prioritized?**
    - **Confidence Score: 88%**

19. **How often do declarations get rejected by multiple approvers (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER) in sequence?**
    - **Confidence Score: 84%**

20. **What effect does the 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE' step have on the overall process cycle time?**
    - **Confidence Score: 86%**

These questions aim to address various aspects of the process, including frequency, performance, bottlenecks, and areas for potential improvement or automation.
