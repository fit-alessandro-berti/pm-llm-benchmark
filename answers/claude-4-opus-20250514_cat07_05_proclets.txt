This visualization consists of three parts showing different aspects of a laboratory testing system:

## (a) Two prodct classes connected through two channels
This is a complex flow diagram showing the interaction between lab visits and lab tests. Key components include:

- **Entry points**: Doctor visits, lab assistants (marked with human figures)
- **Central processes**: 
  - Order entry system (receives orders from doctors)
  - Order system with numbered connections (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
  - Two testing processes: "Receive result" and "Receive updated result"
- **Output activities**: 
  - "Take blood sample" leading to lab assistant
  - "Judge results" 
  - "Do tests again"
  - "Send report"
  - "Perform test" and "Perform test again"
  - "Make report" and "Finish lab test"
- **Information flow**: Indicated by solid and dashed lines with numbered connections (1.1-1.3) and HIS (Hospital Information System) labels

## (b) Class diagram containing the two prodct classes
This simplified diagram shows:
- Two boxes labeled "Lab visit" and "Lab test"
- A "requires" relationship connecting them with cardinality notation (1..1 and 1..*)

## (c) Example of a performative
This is a table showing a communication protocol with columns:
- Time: 11:00
- Channel: Order system
- Sender: Lab visit - John
- Receivers: Lab test - HGB test - John
- Action: Create
- Content: Can you perform a HGB test for John?
- Scope: Private
- Direction: OUT

The visualization appears to be documenting a healthcare laboratory workflow system using different modeling notations.
