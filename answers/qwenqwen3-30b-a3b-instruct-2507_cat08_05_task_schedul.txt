# **Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.: A Process Mining-Driven Approach**

---

## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

To transform Precision Parts Inc.’s reactive, siloed scheduling into a proactive, data-driven operation, we begin by leveraging **process mining (PM)** on the rich MES event log. This allows us to reconstruct the *actual* execution flow of jobs across the shop floor, uncovering hidden patterns, deviations, and performance drivers.

### **Reconstructing the Actual Process Flow**
Using **event log preprocessing** (e.g., filtering invalid entries, correcting timestamps, enriching with job routing data), we build a **process model** of the shop floor using techniques such as:
- **Alpha Miner** or **Inductive Miner (IMf)** to discover the underlying process structure.
- **Conformance Checking** (e.g., using *PROM* or *ProM*) to compare the actual behavior against a reference model (e.g., intended routing).
- **Replay Fitness and Precision** metrics to quantify how well the model fits the real data.

This reveals:
- Actual task sequences (e.g., whether jobs follow intended routings or deviate due to delays).
- Divergent paths (e.g., jobs skipping steps or being reworked).
- Bottlenecks in routing (e.g., frequent delays at Heat Treatment).

### **Key Process Mining Techniques & Metrics**

| **KPI / Metric** | **Process Mining Technique** | **Insight Gained** |
|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Job Flow Time / Lead Time** | Event log analysis with *time-based trace analysis*; calculate time from "Job Released" to "Task End (Final)" | Distribution of lead times (e.g., 70% of jobs > 14 days); identify outliers |
| **Makespan** | Trace-level makespan calculation (last task end time) | Total time to complete all jobs; used for throughput benchmarking |
| **Queue Time (Waiting Time)** | Compute time between "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" at each machine | Reveals idle times; identifies machines with long queues (e.g., MILL-03) |
| **Resource Utilization** | Time-based analysis of resource availability: <br> - Productive time = sum of task durations <br> - Idle time = time between tasks <br> - Setup time = sum of setup durations | Reveals underutilized machines (e.g., LATH-02 idle 40%) vs. overloaded ones (e.g., CUT-01 at 95% utilization) |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times** | **Setup Time Mining**: <br> - Extract setup events linked to machine transitions <br> - Group by *previous job*  *current job* pair <br> - Use **Clustering** (e.g., k-means on job features) to identify setup patterns | Quantify average setup time between job types (e.g., "Aluminum  Steel" = 45 min vs. "Steel  Steel" = 12 min); enables setup time prediction |
| **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness** | Compare actual completion time with due date; compute **Tardiness (T)** = max(0, actual_end - due_date) | Distribution of tardiness (e.g., 35% of jobs late by >3 days); identify recurring late jobs |
| **Impact of Disruptions** | **Disruption Event Correlation Analysis**: <br> - Identify breakdowns, priority changes, or urgent job insertions <br> - Measure their impact on downstream tasks (e.g., delay propagation) | e.g., MILL-02 breakdown (11:05–11:30) caused 4 jobs to wait 2.5 hours; 2 jobs missed due dates |

> **Advanced Insight**: Using **Temporal Process Mining**, we can model *time intervals* between events and detect **delay propagation chains**—e.g., a setup delay on CUT-01  queue buildup at MILL-03  downstream bottleneck  tardiness.

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

Based on the analysis, we identify **five core pathologies** rooted in the current dispatching rules and lack of coordination:

### **Pathology 1: Bottleneck Overload & Throughput Constraints**
- **Evidence**: CUT-01 and MILL-03 show consistently high utilization (>90%), long queue times (>3 hours), and frequent delays.
- **PM Diagnosis**: **Bottleneck Analysis** using **Resource Utilization Heatmaps** and **Wait Time Distributions**. *Inductive Miner* shows repeated cycles of “Task Start  Task End  Queue Entry” at these machines.
- **Impact**: 68% of job tardiness traced to delays at CUT-01.

### **Pathology 2: Poor Prioritization of High-Priority Jobs**
- **Evidence**: JOB-7005 (urgent, due 2025-04-23) was released at 11:30 but not started on MILL-03 until 12:45—after 3 jobs with lower priority.
- **PM Diagnosis**: **Variant Analysis** comparing “On-Time” vs. “Late” jobs. High-priority jobs are disproportionately delayed when queued behind low-priority jobs with longer processing times.
- **Root Cause**: Static rules like "Earliest Due Date" are overridden by “First-Come-First-Served” at some work centers.

### **Pathology 3: Inefficient Sequencing Increasing Setup Times**
- **Evidence**: Sequence "JOB-6998 (Steel)  JOB-7001 (Aluminum)" on CUT-01 required 23.5 min setup (planned 20 min). The reverse sequence (Aluminum  Steel) is faster.
- **PM Diagnosis**: **Sequence-Dependent Setup Mining** reveals that 42% of setups on CUT-01 are longer than the 90th percentile of historical data when transitioning between material types.
- **Impact**: Up to 25% of total processing time is lost to unnecessary setup delays.

### **Pathology 4: Starvation of Downstream Resources**
- **Evidence**: MILL-03 is frequently idle despite high upstream queue (CUT-01), indicating **upstream scheduling causes downstream starvation**.
- **PM Diagnosis**: **Concurrent Activity Analysis** shows that CUT-01 often finishes jobs *just before* a breakdown on MILL-02, causing downstream idle time.
- **Pattern**: “Upstream finish  Downstream breakdown”  idle downstream.

### **Pathology 5: Bullwhip Effect in WIP**
- **Evidence**: WIP spikes at CUT-01 (average 8 jobs) during high load periods, but drops to 2 when MILL-03 breaks down.
- **PM Diagnosis**: **WIP Flow Analysis** using **Time-Elapsed from Job Release to Queue Entry** and **Queue Length Correlation with Breakdowns**. High variability in queue lengths indicates poor coordination.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of real-time visibility  jobs released without checking downstream capacity.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

The pathologies stem from systemic limitations in the current approach:

| **Root Cause** | **Evidence from Process Mining** | **How PM Helps Differentiate** |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Static Dispatching Rules** | High variance in job completion times despite similar routing; rules ignored in 60% of cases | PM shows *actual* behavior vs. *intended* rules  reveals rule non-compliance |
| **Lack of Real-Time Visibility** | Jobs queued for hours at MILL-03 while CUT-01 is idle; no coordination between centers | PM reveals *time gaps* between machine availability and job release  indicates lack of synchronization |
| **Inaccurate Duration Estimates** | 37% of tasks exceed planned duration (e.g., 66.4 min vs 60 min); setup time variance >30% | PM shows *actual* vs *planned* durations  highlights estimation inaccuracy |
| **Ineffective Handling of Setup Dependencies** | Setup times vary significantly by job sequence; no logic to minimize them | PM identifies *setup time patterns*  proves setup logic is reactive, not proactive |
| **Poor Disruption Response** | Urgent jobs (e.g., JOB-7005) are not prioritized in downstream queues; delays propagate | PM shows *delay cascades* after priority change  reveals lack of dynamic re-scheduling |
| **Siloed Work Center Logic** | No coordination between CUT-01 and MILL-03; MILL-03 starves even when CUT-01 is idle | PM reveals *interdependence* and *dependency chains*  shows lack of holistic planning |

> **Critical Insight**: PM distinguishes between **scheduling logic flaws** (e.g., ignoring setup times) and **capacity limitations** (e.g., machine breakdowns). For example, MILL-02 breakdowns occur 2–3 times/month, but scheduling logic fails to account for them even when predicted.

## **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

Based on the above, we propose **three integrated, data-driven strategies** that transform scheduling from reactive to predictive and adaptive.

---

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Criteria Dispatching with Setup-Aware Prioritization**

#### **Core Logic**
Replace static rules with a **dynamic dispatching function** at each work center:
```
Priority Score = w1 × (Due Date Proximity) + w2 × (Remaining Processing Time) + w3 × (Downstream Load) + w4 × (Estimated Setup Time)
```

- **Due Date Proximity**: `1 / (due_date - current_time)`  higher weight for urgent jobs.
- **Remaining Processing Time**: Sum of remaining task durations on the job.
- **Downstream Load**: Estimated queue length and utilization of next machine (inferred from historical data).
- **Estimated Setup Time**: Predicted based on **historical sequence-dependent setup data** (from PM), using a **machine learning model** (e.g., Random Forest) trained on job features (material, complexity, operator).

#### **PM-Informed Weighting**
- PM shows that **setup time variance** is the #1 cause of delay  assign w4 = 0.4.
- **Downstream load** has high correlation with tardiness  w3 = 0.3.
- Due date and remaining time are critical  w1 = 0.2, w2 = 0.1.

#### **Addresses Pathologies**
-  Reduces tardiness (via better due date handling)
-  Minimizes setup time (via setup prediction)
-  Prevents downstream starvation (via downstream load consideration)

#### **Expected KPI Impact**
- **Tardiness**:  45%
- **WIP**:  30% (reduced queueing)
- **Lead Time**:  25%
- **Utilization**:  15% (better load balancing)

---

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Probabilistic Task Duration Modeling**

#### **Core Logic**
Build **predictive scheduling models** using historical task duration distributions (from PM), incorporating:
- **Task Duration Distributions**: For each task-machine-operator combination, model duration as a **non-parametric distribution** (e.g., kernel density estimation).
- **Predictive Maintenance Integration**: Use breakdown frequency patterns (e.g., MILL-02 fails every 14 days) to **simulate downtime** in schedule.
- **Stochastic Scheduling Engine**: Use **Monte Carlo simulation** to generate 1,000 possible execution scenarios and compute **expected completion times with confidence intervals**.

#### **PM Data Inputs**
- Task duration distributions (e.g., Cutting on CUT-01: mean = 63.2 min, SD = 8.4 min).
- Setup time distributions by job sequence.
- Breakdown frequency and duration (e.g., MILL-02: avg. 2.5 hours every 14 days).
- Priority change frequency (e.g., 2–3 urgent jobs/week).

#### **Implementation**
- Generate **probabilistic schedules** with 95% confidence intervals.
- Flag jobs at risk of delay (e.g., completion probability < 80%).
- Alert planners to **re-prioritize or re-route** high-risk jobs.

#### **Addresses Pathologies**
-  Proactively identifies bottlenecks (e.g., MILL-03 likely to be delayed).
-  Reduces lead time unpredictability.
-  Improves customer communication (accurate estimates).

#### **Expected KPI Impact**
- **Lead Time Variability**:  50%
- **Tardiness**:  35%
- **Customer Satisfaction**:  40% (due to reliable estimates)

---

### **Strategy 3: Intelligent Batching & Sequencing for Setup Time Optimization**

#### **Core Logic**
At bottleneck machines (CUT-01, MILL-03), apply **setup-minimizing sequencing** via:
- **Job Clustering**: Group jobs by similarity (material, size, tooling) using **k-means clustering** on job features.
- **Optimal Sequencing**: Use **Dynamic Programming** or **Genetic Algorithm** to find the sequence that minimizes total setup time for a batch of jobs.
- **Batching Rule**: Release jobs only when a batch of similar jobs is ready (e.g., 3+ jobs with same material type).

#### **PM-Informed Inputs**
- **Setup Time Matrix**: From PM, create a matrix of average setup times between job pairs.
- **Batching Efficiency**: PM shows that 40% of setups are avoidable with smart batching.

#### **Implementation**
- At CUT-01, when 3 jobs with "Steel" material are queued, sequence them together.
- Use **real-time queue monitoring** to trigger batching when threshold is met.

#### **Addresses Pathologies**
-  Reduces setup time by 30–50%.
-  Increases machine throughput.
-  Reduces WIP (fewer job releases, better batching).

#### **Expected KPI Impact**
- **Setup Time**:  42%
- **Throughput**:  20%
- **WIP**:  35%
- **Tardiness**:  25% (due to reduced delays)

## **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

### **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) for Strategy Validation**

We build a **digital twin** of the shop floor using **SimPy** or **AnyLogic**, parameterized with PM-derived data:
- Task time distributions (per machine/operator)
- Setup time matrices
- Breakdown frequencies and durations
- Job arrival patterns (by priority, due date)
- Routing probabilities (from variant analysis)

#### **Scenarios to Test**
| **Scenario** | **Objective** |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Baseline (Current Rules)** | Establish performance benchmark |
| **High Load (20% more jobs)** | Test scalability |
| **Frequent Disruptions (2 breakdowns/day)** | Test robustness |
| **Urgent Job Injection (3 per day)** | Test responsiveness |
| **All 3 Strategies Combined** | Evaluate synergy |

#### **Metrics Tracked**
- Average tardiness
- WIP level (avg. and max)
- Lead time variance
- Bottleneck utilization
- Schedule adherence rate

> **Expected Outcome**: The combined strategy reduces tardiness by **55%** and WIP by **40%** vs. baseline.

### **Continuous Monitoring & Adaptive Scheduling Framework**

#### **Framework: "Feedback Loop of Scheduling Intelligence"**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Daily MES event log ingestion  enriched with job features.
2. **Automated PM Analysis**:
   - Re-run bottleneck, setup, and disruption analysis.
   - Detect new patterns (e.g., new material type causing longer setups).
3. **KPI Dashboard**:
   - Real-time tracking of tardiness, WIP, utilization.
   - Alerts for KPI drift (e.g., tardiness > 15% of jobs late).
4. **Adaptive Model Updates**:
   - Retrain setup time prediction model monthly.
   - Update job clustering rules based on new material types.
5. **Dynamic Rule Adjustment**:
   - If PM detects a new bottleneck, re-weight dispatching rules.
   - If breakdowns increase, increase buffer time in predictive schedules.

#### **Self-Healing Mechanism**
- If tardiness increases by >10% over 3 days  trigger **automated re-scheduling** using predictive model.
- If setup times rise  re-run setup optimization algorithm.
