The visualization shows how two processes in a hospital information system cooperate: a **Lab visit** process and a **Lab test** process.

### (a) Two proctlet classes connected through two channels  
This large diagram is a process model with swimlanelike areas:

- **Left side – “Lab visit” proctlet**  
  - Starts with a **doctor** requesting a lab order.  
  - A **lab assistant** performs *Order entry* and *Take blood sample*.  
  - An **Order system** channel sends the order to the lab test process.  
  - Later the lab assistant:
    - *Receive result* from the HIS (Hospital Information System).  
    - *Judge results* (decide if they are acceptable).  
      - If everything is fine, the path goes directly to *Send report* to the doctor.  
      - If not, it goes to *Do tests again*, which triggers another request to the Lab test process, and then *Receive updated result* and again *Judge results*.  
  - Start and end events are shown as black circles.

- **Right side – “Lab test” proctlet**  
  - Triggered by messages from the **Order system**.  
  - A **chemical analyst** performs the lab work: *Perform test* then *Make report*.  
  - The result is sent back via the HIS channel.  
  - If a repeated test is requested, the analyst *Perform test again* and *Provide updated report*, ending with *Finish lab test*.

- **Middle – Communication channels**  
  - Two dashed boxes labeled **Order system** and **HIS** represent message channels.  
  - Labeled connectors (l1, l2, …) show specific message exchanges between the two processes over these channels (e.g., sending the order, sending results, sending updated results).

Overall, this part illustrates two interacting workflow “proctlets,” each with its own internal activities, but synchronized through messages.

### (b) Class diagram containing the two proctlet classes  
The small box on the right is a UMLstyle class diagram:

- A class **Lab visit** and a class **Lab test**.  
- The association “requires” indicates that each *Lab visit* (multiplicity 1..1) is associated with one or more *Lab test* instances (multiplicity 1..*).  
This expresses the structural relationship between the two processes.

### (c) Example of a performative  
The table at the bottom is a concrete message example (a “performative”):

- **Time:** 11:00  
- **Channel:** Order system  
- **Sender:** Lab visit – John  
- **Receivers:** Lab test – HGB John  
- **Action:** Create  
- **Content:** “Can you perform a HGB test for John?”  
- **Scope:** Private  
- **Direction:** OUT  

It shows one specific communication instance on the “Order system” channel, corresponding to the order being sent from the Lab visit proctlet to the Lab test proctlet.
