The visualization shows how two processes in a hospital information system interact: a *Lab visit* process and a *Lab test* process.

**(a) Two proctlet classes connected through two channels**

- The left swimlane is **Lab visit** (patient side).  
  - A doctor or lab assistant initiates an **Order entry**.  
  - A blood sample is taken (**Take blood sample**) and an order is sent through the **Order system** channel.  
  - Later, the lab visit process **Receives result**, **Judges results** (green “everything fine” or red “do tests again”), and either:
    - **Send report** to the requester if results are fine, or  
    - Request the lab to **Do tests again**, then **Receive updated result** and finally **Send report**.

- The right swimlane is **Lab test** (laboratory side).  
  - After receiving an order, a chemical analyst **Performs test**, then **Makes report** and sends it back through the HIS (Health Information System) channel.  
  - If the lab visit requests a retest, the analyst **Performs test again**, **Provides updated report**, and then **Finishes lab test**.

- The dashed boxes labeled **Order system** and **HIS** in the middle represent two asynchronous communication channels connecting the two proctlet classes. The numbered arrows (1.1, 1.2, …) are message exchanges over these channels, e.g., sending orders, sending results, sending updated results.

**(b) Class diagram**

- A simple UML-style class diagram shows:
  - Class **Lab visit**  
  - Class **Lab test**  
  - A “requires” association: each *Lab visit* requires exactly one *Lab test* (1..1 on Lab visit side, 1..* on Lab test side meaning one visit can involve one or more lab tests).

**(c) Example of a performative**

- A table describing one message instance (a performative) on the **Order system** channel:
  - **Time:** 11:00  
  - **Channel:** Order system  
  - **Sender:** Lab visit – John  
  - **Receivers:** Lab test – HGB, John  
  - **Action:** Create  
  - **Content:** “Can you perform a HGB test for John?”  
  - **Scope:** Private  
  - **Direction:** OUT  

Overall, the visualization models how lab visit and lab test processes coordinate via messaging channels in a hospital information system, including both initial testing and possible retesting.
