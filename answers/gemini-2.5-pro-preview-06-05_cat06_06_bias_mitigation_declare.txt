Here is the updated DECLARE model with new constraints to mitigate bias, followed by an explanation of the changes.

### Updated DECLARE Model

```python
declare_model = {
    # Original constraints (with 'FinalDecision' kept for original model integrity)
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # --- New activities added for bias mitigation ---
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # --- New Coexistence constraint ---
        # Ensures that any rejection is always accompanied by a manual review.
        "Reject": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        # --- New Precedence constraint ---
        # Ensures a bias check must occur before a rejection decision is made.
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # --- New Succession constraint ---
        # Enforces that checking sensitive data must be followed by a bias mitigation check.
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {
        # --- New Non-Coexistence constraint ---
        # An application cannot be both approved and rejected in the same trace.
        "Approve": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonsuccession": {
        # --- New Non-Succession constraint ---
        # Prevents a direct, immediate rejection after viewing sensitive attributes.
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints

To mitigate bias in the loan application process, we introduced several new activities (`CheckSensitiveAttributes`, `BiasMitigationCheck`, `ManualReview`, `Approve`, `Reject`) and the following four key constraints:

1.  **`nonsuccession("CheckSensitiveAttributes", "Reject")`**
    *   **Purpose:** This constraint prevents a `Reject` decision from occurring *immediately* after the `CheckSensitiveAttributes` activity.
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** It breaks the direct causal link between observing a sensitive attribute (like race or age) and making a negative decision. By forcing at least one other activity to happen in between (such as the `BiasMitigationCheck`), it discourages reflexive, potentially biased judgments.

2.  **`succession("CheckSensitiveAttributes", "BiasMitigationCheck")`**
    *   **Purpose:** This constraint mandates that if `CheckSensitiveAttributes` occurs, then a `BiasMitigationCheck` must also occur later in the process. Furthermore, `CheckSensitiveAttributes` must precede `BiasMitigationCheck`.
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** It ensures that whenever sensitive data is accessed, a formal, auditable fairness check is triggered. This transforms the process from one where bias *might* be checked to one where it *must* be checked, promoting accountability.

3.  **`precedence("BiasMitigationCheck", "Reject")`**
    *   **Purpose:** This constraint states that if a `Reject` activity occurs, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must have occurred at some point before it.
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** This works in tandem with the `succession` constraint to enforce a logical and fair sequence. It guarantees that no rejection can be finalized without a prior fairness assessment, serving as a critical gateway to prevent biased outcomes.

4.  **`coexistence("Reject", "ManualReview")`**
    *   **Purpose:** This constraint ensures that for every trace containing a `Reject` activity, a `ManualReview` activity must also be present (and vice-versa). The order does not matter.
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** It enforces a "human-in-the-loop" safeguard for all negative outcomes. By requiring a manual review for every rejection, the model reduces the risk of automated bias and provides an opportunity for a human expert to catch and correct unfair decisions.

5.  **`noncoexistence("Approve", "Reject")`**
    *   **Purpose:** This is a logical constraint ensuring that a single application trace cannot contain both an `Approve` and a `Reject` decision.
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** While primarily for model correctness, it ensures the final outcome is unambiguous, which is essential for auditing and analyzing fairness metrics accurately.
