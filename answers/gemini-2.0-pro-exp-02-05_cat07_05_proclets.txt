This visualization illustrates a system involving lab visits and associated lab tests, broken down into three parts:

1.  **(a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels:** This is the main part, showing two interacting workflow processes, referred to as "proclets".
    *   **Left Proclet (Lab visit):** Starts with a "Lab visit", involves a "doctor" performing "Order entry", a "lab assistant" taking a "blood sample", receiving results, judging them, potentially triggering re-tests ("Do tests again"), receiving updated results, and finally sending a report.
    *   **Right Proclet (Lab test):** Starts with "Lab test", involves a "chemical analyst" performing the test, making a report, potentially performing the test again and providing an updated report, and finally finishing the lab test.
    *   **Interaction:** The two proclets communicate and synchronize through two channels, depicted as dashed boxes: "Order system" and "HIS" (likely Hospital Information System). Arrows indicate the flow of information:
        *   "Order entry" sends data to the "Order system", which is received by "Perform test".
        *   "Make report" sends data to "HIS", received by "Receive result".
        *   "Do tests again" sends data to "HIS", received by "Perform test again".
        *   "Provide updated report" sends data to "HIS", received by "Receive updated result".
    *   **Notation:** Uses flowchart-like symbols: start/end events, activities (rectangles), decision/merge points (circles), and actors/roles associated with activities. Grayed-out boxes likely represent interaction points or states related to communication. Cardinalities (`*,1`, `1,1`, `1,?`) on the channel connections suggest message multiplicity.

2.  **(b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes:** This is a simple UML class diagram showing the static relationship between the two types of processes (proclets).
    *   It contains two classes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test".
    *   An association labeled "requires" connects them.
    *   Cardinalities indicate that one "Lab visit" instance requires one or more (`1..*`) "Lab test" instances, and each "Lab test" instance is required by exactly one (`1..1`) "Lab visit" instance.

3.  **(c) Example of a performative:** This table shows a concrete instance of communication between the proclets.
    *   It details a message sent at 11:00 via the "Order system" channel.
    *   The sender is an instance of "Lab visit" (for patient "John").
    *   The receiver is an instance of "Lab test" (for an HGB test for John).
    *   The action is "Create", and the content is a request: "Can you perform a HGB test for John?".
    *   The scope is "Private", and the direction is "OUT" (outgoing from the sender).
    *   This exemplifies the communication occurring when "Order entry" sends data via the "Order system" in part (a).

**In summary:** The visualization describes a system using the "proclet" concept. It shows the dynamic workflows of a "Lab visit" and a "Lab test" proclet (a), how they interact via communication channels (a), the static structural relationship between these proclet types (b), and a specific example of a message ("performative") exchanged between instances (c).
