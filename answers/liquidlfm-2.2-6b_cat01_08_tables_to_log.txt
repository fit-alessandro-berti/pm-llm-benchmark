**Notes:**
- **Settlement Initiated** not always tracked per delivery but reflects when invoice was processed.  
- **Order Dispatched** entries came either from existing order/delivery or hypothetical scheduled sort-after.  
- **Unmatched delivery notes** (e.g., "Must await delivery info for partial groups") were resolved assuming delivery via same carrier and asset fit for same items implicitly.  
- **Applied SMART Naming** for activities where table data implicitly suggested multiple events (e.g., "Items Picked - Gadget X") with temporal clustering via Order Creation timestamps.  
- **Resource/Actor focused on roles at key movement steps (Delivery, Payment).**  
- **Conflicts in item counts/delivery not fully resolved** due to table inconsistencies (e.g., order numbers mismatch), assumed to reflect order status alignment across systems.
