1. The “normal” Hire-to-Retire sequence  

   Post Job Ad    Screen Candidates    Conduct Interviews    
   Make Hiring Decision    Onboard Employee    Add to Payroll    Close Case  

   • Each activity is executed exactly once.  
   • Screening precedes interviews; interviews precede the hiring decision; payroll is always executed before the case is closed.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Anomalies in each POWL model

MODEL 1  

A. Wrong dependency between Interviews and Decision (severe)  
   – From the edges we have  
        Screen  Decide and Screen  Interview  
     but nothing between Interview and Decide.  
   – Consequently the decision may be taken before the interviews are held or while the interviews are still running.

B. Interviews can take place after onboarding, after payroll or even after the case is closed (severe/odd)  
   – Because Interview is unrelated to Decide, Onboard, Payroll or Close, any global ordering in which Interview is scheduled late is permitted.

C. No possibility to repeat screening / interviewing rounds (minor modelling restriction rather than an error).

Positive aspects of model 1  
   • Screening is guaranteed to happen before the decision.  
   • Onboarding and payroll are mandatory and occur in the right order (Decision  Onboard  Payroll  Close).  
   • No activity can be skipped.

--------------------------------------------------------------

MODEL 2  

A. Screening not required before Interview or Decision (moderate)  
   – Only Post  Screen is enforced. Screen can legally occur after Interview and even after the hiring decision.

B. Payroll is optional (very severe)  
   – The XOR operator (Payroll  skip) allows the path “skip”, i.e. the employee may never be put on the payroll even though the process is closed.

C. Unlimited repetitions of Onboarding (odd but not catastrophic)  
   – The loop (Onboard, ) ensures at least one onboarding, but it may repeat endlessly.

D. Post  Interview runs in parallel (acceptable), but because Screen may be delayed the usual “screen-first” policy is violated.

Positive aspects of model 2  
   • Interview must precede the hiring decision (Interview  Decide), which is sound.  
   • All activities that are present in the model respect their basic local order (Decision precedes Onboard, Onboard precedes the XOR block, etc.).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Which model is closer to the normative process?

• Model 1 keeps every mandatory activity, and it preserves the indispensable “pay the employee” step.  
• Its chief defect is the misplaced ordering of Interviews relative to the Decision, but the work is still carried out.  
• Model 2, in contrast, allows the process to finish without adding the employee to payroll—an error that violates both legal and business-critical requirements of any Hire-to-Retire procedure. Moreover, screening can be done after the hire, contradicting standard HR practice.

Because the ability to omit payroll (and thus salary, taxes, socialsecurity, etc.) constitutes a far more fundamental breach of process integrity than performing an interview late, Model 1 is the variant that more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire workflow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary  

• Model 1 anomaly: interviews can occur after the hiring decision (ordering flaw).  
• Model 2 anomalies: screening can be late, onboarding can repeat, and – most critically – payroll can be skipped entirely.  

Therefore Model 1, despite its ordering mistake, better preserves the essential logic of a Hire-to-Retire process than Model 2.
