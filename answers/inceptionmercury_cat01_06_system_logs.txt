To transform the provided Windows system log into a process mining event log, we need to identify coherent cases, translate raw actions into higher-level activities, and structure the data with appropriate attributes. Here's how we can achieve this:

### Data Transformation and Case Identification

1. **Case Identification:**
   - A "case" can be identified by the user's focus on a specific document or application, which represents a logical unit of work.
   - We will create cases based on the sequence of interactions with different documents and applications.

2. **Activity Naming:**
   - Translate low-level actions into meaningful activity names:
     - `FOCUS` becomes `Open Document`
     - `TYPING` becomes `Edit Document`
     - `SAVE` becomes `Save Document`
     - `SWITCH` becomes `Switch Application`
     - `CLICK` becomes `Interact with Email`
     - `SCROLL` becomes `Review Email`
     - `HIGHLIGHT` becomes `Highlight in PDF`
     - `CLOSE` becomes `Close Document`

3. **Event Attributes:**
   - Each event will have the following attributes: `Case ID`, `Activity Name`, and `Timestamp`.

### Event Log Table

### Explanation

- **Case 1:** Represents the user working on `Document1.docx`, switching to Gmail to handle an email, and then reviewing a PDF. The sequence of events around `Document1.docx` and the email interaction forms a coherent case.
  
- **Case 2:** Involves the user working on `Budget_2024.xlsx`, making edits, saving, and then returning to `Document1.docx` for further editing. This case captures the workflow related to budget updates and document referencing.

- **Case 3:** Captures the user's session on `Quarterly_Report.docx`, where they draft an executive summary and save their work.

This transformation provides a structured event log that can be analyzed using standard process mining tools to understand the user's workflow and identify potential areas for optimization.
