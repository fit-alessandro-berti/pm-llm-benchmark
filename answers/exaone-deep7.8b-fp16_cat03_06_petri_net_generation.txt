<thought>
Okay, I need to construct an accepting Petri net for this insurance claim process. Let me start by understanding the problem again. The process has several steps with possible loops like re-submission of documents or in-depth investigations. The Petri net should model these transitions and places, with initial and final markings.

First, let me list all the activities and their order. The main steps are:

1. Claim Registration (CR)
2. Document Verification (DV)
3. Fraud Check (FC)
4. Claim Assessment (CA)
5. Approval (AP)
6. Payment (P)
7. Notification (N)
8. Closure (CL)

But there are also the optional steps: Re-Document Submission (RDS) and In-depth Investigation (II) which can occur multiple times before proceeding.

Hmm, how to model the optional paths? Let's think about the possible transitions.

Starting from the initial state, the claim arrives (maybe an 'init' place?), then CR happens. After CR, the next step is DV. After DV, if documents are incomplete, we go to RDS, which loops back to DV again. So there's a loop between DV and RDS. Similarly, after FC, if there's doubt, we go to II, which might loop back to FC again. So FC and II form another loop.

So the structure would have branches where after certain steps, there are possible loops. Let's outline the possible transitions:

- CR leads to DV.
- DV can lead to FC if documents are okay, or to RDS if not. Wait, actually, the problem says that if DV finds incomplete docs, then RDS happens before proceeding. So after DV, if docs are incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV again. So the path DV -> RDS -> DV -> ... until documents are okay, then proceed to FC.

Wait, the problem says: "if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs (RDS) before the process continues." So after DV, if incomplete, go to RDS, then after RDS, the process continues. But how does that continue? Probably back to DV again to check again. So the loop is DV <-> RDS.

Similarly for FC and II: after FC, if there's doubt, do II, which may loop back to FC again. So FC <-> II.

So the process flow would have these loops as possible transitions.

Let me try to outline the sequence of transitions:

Start at the initial place (maybe 'start').

1. CR: from start to a place after CR.
2. Then DV. After DV, check if documents are okay. If yes, proceed to FC. If not, go to RDS, then back to DV again.
3. After FC, if no fraud, proceed to CA. But if there's doubt, go to II, then back to FC again. So after FC, possible paths to II or to CA.
4. CA leads to AP. AP checks if the amount is over threshold. If yes, proceed to payment. If not, maybe back to some point? Wait, the problem says "if the amount surpasses a threshold, must be approved by a senior manager". So if the amount is under, perhaps the process can proceed to payment without approval? Or maybe the approval is required only when the amount is over. The problem says "must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold". So if the amount is under, maybe it can proceed to payment without approval. Hmm, that complicates things. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold". So if the amount is under, approval is not needed, so the process can proceed to payment. So after CA, the adjuster decides the amount. Then, if the amount is over, AP (approval) is needed. So the path after CA is:

- CA -> AP (if amount > threshold) -> Payment (P) -> Notification (N) -> Closure (CL)
- Or, if amount <= threshold, then CA -> Payment (P) -> Notification (N) -> Closure (CL)

Wait, but how is the approval handled? The Approval step (AP) is a transition that requires the senior manager's approval. So if the amount is over, you must go through AP. Otherwise, you can skip AP and go directly to payment. So the path branches here.

So after CA, there's a decision point. Let me model that.

Also, after payment (P), the notification (N) happens, then closure (CL). So the payment step leads to notification, then closure.

Now, putting all this together, let's try to model the transitions and places.

Let me list all the possible places (states) in the Petri net. Each place represents a state after an activity. The transitions are labeled with the activity names, and the arcs connect the places accordingly.

Possible places could be:

- start: initial state (token here at start)
- after_cr: after Claim Registration
- after_dv: after Document Verification
- after_fc: after Fraud Check
- after_ca: after Claim Assessment
- after_ap: after Approval
- after_p: after Payment
- after_n: after Notification
- after_cl: after Closure (final state)

Additionally, the loops:

- Between DV and RDS: so after DV, if documents are incomplete, transition to RDS, then back to DV? Or perhaps after RDS, it goes back to DV again. So the places would be after_dv and after_rds? Wait, maybe the RDS is a transition from after_dv to after_rds, then from after_rds back to after_dv? Or perhaps the RDS is part of the same process. Hmm.

Alternatively, the RDS step is part of the process after DV. Let's think:

After DV, if documents are incomplete, you go to RDS. After RDS, you check again, so you loop back to DV again. So the transitions would be DV -> RDS -> DV -> ... until documents are okay, then proceed to FC.

So the places would be after_dv and after_rds. The transition from after_dv to after_rds is labeled RDS (Re-Document Submission). Then from after_rds back to after_dv (since after re-submitting, you check again). Wait, but how does the loop work? Let's see:

The process after DV is:

If documents are okay: proceed to FC.

If not okay: go to RDS, then after RDS, you go back to DV again (to check again). So the transitions would be:

after_dv --RDS--> after_rds, then after_rds --DV--> after_dv again? Or perhaps the RDS is a transition that loops back to after_dv?

Alternatively, maybe the RDS step is a separate place, and after RDS, you go back to DV. So the transitions would be:

after_dv --RDS--> after_rds, then after_rds --DV--> after_dv again. So the loop is DV <-> RDS via those transitions.

Similarly for FC and II:

after_fc --II--> after_ii, then after_ii --FC--> after_fc again. So the loop is FC <-> II.

So the places would include after_dv, after_rds, after_fc, after_ii, etc.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complex. Let me try to outline all the transitions step by step.

Let me start by listing all the transitions and their possible paths.

Transitions:

- CR: from start to after_cr.

- DV: from after_cr to after_dv. Wait, no. Wait, after CR, the next step is DV. So the transition CR would be from the start place to after_cr, then DV is from after_cr to after_dv? Or maybe the transitions are labeled with the activity names, and the places are the states between them.

Wait, in Petri nets, transitions are between places. Each transition has input places and output places.

Alternatively, perhaps each activity is a transition, and the places represent the state after that activity. So the transitions are labeled with the activity names, and the places are the nodes between transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions are the activity names, and the places are the states between them. For example, the initial place is 'start', then the first transition is CR, which takes you from 'start' to 'after_cr', then the next transition is DV, taking you to 'after_dv', etc. But with loops, some transitions can go back to previous places.

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to model each step as a transition between places. Let me try to outline the transitions and their connections.

Let me start building the Petri net step by step.

Initial Place: Let's call it 'start' (since that's the initial state). The initial marking has a token here.

Transitions:

1. CR: from 'start' to 'after_cr'.

2. DV: from 'after_cr' to 'after_dv'.

3. RDS: from 'after_dv' to 'after_rds' (if documents are incomplete). Then after RDS, perhaps back to 'after_dv' again? Or maybe after RDS, it goes back to 'after_cr'? Hmm, perhaps after re-submitting documents, you go back to DV again. So after RDS, the next transition is DV again. So the loop is between 'after_dv' and 'after_rds' via RDS and DV transitions?

Wait, perhaps the transitions are:

- DV can have two possible transitions: one for when documents are okay (proceeding to FC) and another for when they are not (proceeding to RDS). But in Petri nets, transitions are deterministic in their input and output. So maybe we need separate transitions for each possible path. Alternatively, use the same transition label but different arcs. Hmm, perhaps using the same transition label but different arcs (like multiple arcs from the same place with different labels). But perhaps it's better to model each possible path with separate transitions.

Alternatively, use the same transition label but with different arcs. Wait, maybe the transitions can have multiple arcs from the same place with different labels. For example, the DV transition could have two arcs: one leading to FC, another leading to RDS. But I'm not sure if that's how Petri nets work. Each transition can have multiple arcs (i.e., multiple output places), but each arc is a separate transition. Alternatively, perhaps using different transition names for each possible path.

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions are labeled with the activity names, but the transitions can have different input and output places based on the path. Hmm, this might get complicated.

Alternatively, model the possible transitions as separate transitions with the same label but different arcs. Wait, perhaps the transitions can have multiple arcs (i.e., multiple output places), but each arc is considered a separate transition. For example, the DV transition could have two arcs: one leading to FC and another leading to RDS. But in Petri net terms, each transition is a single entity with input and output places. So perhaps each possible path requires a separate transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions are labeled with the activity name, and the arcs are determined by the possible paths. For example, the DV transition from after_cr to after_dv, but then from after_dv there are two possible transitions: one labeled DV (if documents are okay) leading to FC, and another labeled RDS leading to after_rds. Wait, but that might not fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions are as follows:

- CR: start  after_cr

- DV: after_cr  after_dv

- FC: after_dv  after_fc (if documents are okay)

- RDS: after_dv  after_rds (if documents are not okay)

Then, after RDS, you go back to DV again. So the RDS transition leads to after_rds, and then from after_rds, there's a transition labeled DV again, leading back to after_dv? Or perhaps after RDS, you go back to after_cr? Hmm, maybe the process after RDS is to re-check the documents, so the next step is DV again. So the transitions would be:

After RDS (after_rds), you can go back to DV (after_dv). So the transition from after_rds to after_dv is labeled DV again. But how to model that? Because the DV transition was already from after_cr to after_dv. So perhaps the transitions can be reused as long as their input and output places are correct.

Alternatively, maybe the transitions are labeled with the activity name, and their input and output places are determined by the path. For example, the DV transition can be taken from after_cr to after_dv, and also from after_rds back to after_dv. But in Petri nets, a transition can have multiple input places. Wait, no. Each transition has a set of input places and a set of output places. So a transition can't have multiple input places. Therefore, perhaps the transitions need to be separate for each possible path.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to model each possible path with separate transitions.

Let me try to outline all transitions and their connections:

1. CR: input is start  output is after_cr.

2. DV: input is after_cr  output is after_dv.

3. FC_ok: input is after_dv  output is after_fc (if documents are okay).

4. RDS: input is after_dv  output is after_rds (if documents are not okay).

5. DV_again: input is after_rds  output is after_dv (after re-submitting, we check again).

6. FC: input is after_dv  output is after_fc (but this might conflict with FC_ok? Or perhaps FC is the same as FC_ok? Maybe FC is the transition to the fraud check result. Hmm, perhaps FC is the transition to after_fc regardless, but then there's a decision point there. Maybe I need to split FC into two transitions: FC_ok and FC_investigate (II). Wait, perhaps the Fraud Check (FC) step leads to either proceeding to CA or going into investigation. So after FC, if no fraud, proceed to CA. If fraud, go to II. So the FC transition could have two possible paths.

Alternatively, the FC step is a transition that leads to after_fc, and then from after_fc there are two transitions: one for II and one for CA.

Wait, perhaps the transitions are:

After DV (after_dv), you can go to FC (transition FC leading to after_fc), then from after_fc, you can go to II (transition II leading to after_ii) or to CA (transition CA leading to after_ca). But how to model the decision here?

Alternatively, the FC step is a transition that can have two possible outputs. But in Petri nets, transitions are deterministic in their outputs. So perhaps the FC transition leads to after_fc, and then there are two transitions from after_fc: one labeled II and another labeled CA. But the problem states that if there's doubt (fraud), then an in-depth investigation (II) is performed. So the path would be FC  II  FC again (loop), or FC  CA if no fraud.

Hmm, perhaps the process is:

After DV, you have FC. If there's fraud, you go to II, then back to FC again. If no fraud, proceed to CA.

So transitions would be:

- FC: after_dv  after_fc.

Then from after_fc, there are two possible transitions:

- II: after_fc  after_ii (for in-depth investigation).

- CA: after_fc  after_ca (if no fraud).

But how to model the decision between II and CA? Since in Petri nets, transitions are deterministic, perhaps the presence of a token in a certain place allows the transition. Alternatively, use different transitions for each path.

Alternatively, the II transition can loop back to FC, allowing multiple investigations. So the path would be:

FC  II  FC  ... (loop) until resolved, then proceed to CA.

So transitions would be:

FC: after_dv  after_fc.

II: after_fc  after_ii.

Then, from after_ii, perhaps another II transition back to after_fc, allowing multiple loops. So II can be a transition that loops back to FC (after_fc). Wait, but after_ii would need to connect back to FC's place.

Alternatively, after II (after_ii), the next step is back to FC (after_fc). So the transitions would be:

II: after_fc  after_ii.

Then, from after_ii, there's another transition (maybe another II) leading back to after_fc. But that would allow looping.

Alternatively, the II transition can have a loop. For example, after_fc  after_ii via II transition, then after_ii  after_fc via another II transition. But that would require two transitions with the same label but different arcs. Or perhaps the same transition can have multiple arcs? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the II transition can have a loop by having the same input and output places. But that might not be allowed. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline all transitions step by step again, perhaps using a different approach.

Let me try to model the entire process with all possible transitions and places, then see how to code it.

Places:

- start: initial state.

- after_cr: after Claim Registration.

- after_dv: after Document Verification.

- after_fc: after Fraud Check.

- after_ii: after In-depth Investigation.

- after_ca: after Claim Assessment.

- after_ap: after Approval.

- after_p: after Payment.

- after_n: after Notification.

- after_cl: after Closure (final state).

Additionally, for the loops:

- after_dv and after_rds (for RDS loop).

Wait, perhaps the RDS requires a separate place. Let me think again.

The RDS step is triggered when documents are incomplete after DV. So after DV (after_dv), if documents are incomplete, you go to RDS (transition RDS leading to after_rds). Then, after RDS (after_rds), you need to re-verify the documents, so you go back to DV again. So the transition from after_rds to after_dv would be labeled DV again. But how to model that? Because the original DV transition was from after_cr to after_dv. So perhaps the DV transition can be taken from after_rds back to after_dv. But in Petri nets, transitions can have multiple input places. Wait, no. Each transition has a set of input places and a set of output places. So the DV transition would need to have after_cr as input and after_dv as output, and also after_rds as input and after_dv as output. But that would require the DV transition to have two input places, which isn't allowed unless it's a combined transition with multiple arcs. Hmm, perhaps using the same transition label for different arcs. Alternatively, use different transitions for each possible path.

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions are as follows:

- DV1: from after_cr to after_dv (the initial document verification).

- RDS: from after_dv to after_rds.

- DV2: from after_rds back to after_dv (re-verification after re-submission).

So the transitions are labeled as DV1, RDS, DV2. But the problem states that the transitions should be labeled with the activity names. The activity names are CR, DV, FC, etc. So perhaps the RDS and DV are part of the same activity's name but different steps. Alternatively, maybe the transitions can have the same label but different arcs. For example, the DV transition can be taken from after_cr to after_dv, and also from after_rds to after_dv. But in Petri net terms, a transition can't have multiple input places unless it's a combined transition with multiple arcs. So perhaps the DV transition has two arcs: one from after_cr to after_dv, and another from after_rds to after_dv. But how to represent that in code?

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions are labeled with the activity name, and their input and output places are determined by the path. For example, the DV transition can be taken from after_cr to after_dv, and also from after_rds to after_dv. But in that case, the same transition (DV) would have two different input places, which isn't allowed. Each transition's input places must be a specific set.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the transitions need to be separate for each possible path. For example, DV_initial (from after_cr to after_dv), RDS (from after_dv to after_rds), DV_recheck (from after_rds to after_dv). But then the activity names would have to be different. But the problem says transitions should be labeled with the activity names. The activity names are given as steps like CR, DV, FC, etc. So the RDS and DV are part of the same activity's process. Hmm, perhaps the problem allows for the transitions to have the same label but different arcs. For example, the DV transition can be part of a loop, with different input places.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows us to model the transitions with the same label but different arcs. For example, the DV transition can have two arcs: one from after_cr to after_dv, and another from after_rds to after_dv. In that case, the same transition (DV) would have multiple arcs. But in the pm4py library, how is this handled?

Looking at the pm4py documentation, transitions can have multiple arcs (i.e., multiple output places) but each arc is a separate transition. Wait, no. Each transition is a single entity with input and output places. So perhaps the way to model this is to have separate transitions for each possible path. For example, DV1 and DV2 with different labels, but that's not ideal. Alternatively, use the same label but different transition objects. But the problem requires transitions to be labeled with the activity names. So perhaps the activity names are the labels, and the transitions can have multiple input places. But that's not allowed in Petri nets.

Hmm, maybe I need to model the loops using separate transitions with different labels but part of the same activity's name. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the transitions to have the same label but different arcs, even if that's not strictly correct in Petri net theory. Since the problem says to label transitions with the activity names, perhaps the RDS and DV are considered part of the same activity's name but different steps, so their transitions can be labeled with the same name but different arcs.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to model the transitions as follows:

- The main transitions are CR, DV, FC, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

- The optional transitions (RDS, II) are also transitions labeled with their activity names, and the arcs are connected accordingly.

So let's try this approach.

Places:

start, after_cr, after_dv, after_fc, after_ii, after_ca, after_ap, after_p, after_n, after_cl.

Additionally, for the RDS loop:

after_dv  RDS  after_rds  DV  after_dv again.

Wait, but then after_rds would need to connect back to after_dv via the DV transition. But the DV transition's input would be after_rds. So perhaps the DV transition can have two input places: after_cr and after_rds. But that's not allowed in Petri nets. Each transition must have a single set of input places.

Hmm, this is a problem. To model this loop, perhaps we need to have separate transitions for each possible path.

Let me try to outline all transitions with their input and output places:

1. CR: input is start  output is after_cr.

2. DV: input is after_cr  output is after_dv.

3. RDS: input is after_dv  output is after_rds.

4. DV_recheck: input is after_rds  output is after_dv.

This way, after DV (after_dv), if documents are incomplete, you take RDS to after_rds, then DV_recheck back to after_dv. So the transitions are DV and DV_recheck with the same label? But the problem requires transitions to be labeled with the activity names. The activity names are DV and RDS, so perhaps RDS is a separate transition, and DV_recheck is another transition labeled DV again. But that would require two transitions with the same label, which may not be allowed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows multiple transitions with the same label but different arcs. For example, the DV transition can have two arcs: one from after_cr to after_dv, and another from after_rds to after_dv. But in code, how is this done?

Looking at the pm4py code, transitions are added with a name and other parameters. Each transition has a list of input places and a list of output places. So perhaps the same name can be used for different transitions as long as they are in different parts of the net.

For example:

- Transition DV1: name 'DV', inputs [after_cr], outputs [after_dv].

- Transition DV2: name 'DV', inputs [after_rds], outputs [after_dv].

But this way, the same name is used for different transitions, which might be acceptable as per the problem's requirements. The problem says transitions should be labeled with the activity names, so 'DV' is the label for both transitions. This way, the arcs are properly connected.

Similarly for the II loop:

- FC: input after_dv  output after_fc.

- II: input after_fc  output after_ii.

- II_loop: input after_ii  output after_fc.

But again, the label would be 'II' for the transitions.

Alternatively, the FC transition leads to after_fc, and then from there, two transitions: II and CA. But how to model the choice between them?

Alternatively, the FC transition is followed by either II or CA, so the transitions would be:

- FC: after_dv  after_fc.

- II: after_fc  after_ii.

- II_loop: after_ii  after_fc (allowing multiple investigations).

- CA: after_fc  after_ca.

But then, after FC (after_fc), the system can choose between II and CA. To model this choice, perhaps there are two transitions from after_fc: II and CA. But the problem states that if there's doubt (fraud), then II is performed. So the path would be FC  II  FC  ... until resolved, then proceed to CA. So the CA transition would only be taken after the loop is exited.

Hmm, perhaps the CA transition is only available after exiting the II loop. So the transitions would be:

After FC (after_fc), you can go to II (transition II leading to after_ii), and from after_ii you can go back to FC (after_fc) via another II transition. Once you decide to stop the investigation (maybe by some condition), you proceed to CA. But how to model that decision? Perhaps the presence of a token in a certain place allows the transition to CA.

Alternatively, the problem allows us to model this with the transitions as follows:

- FC leads to after_fc.

- From after_fc, there is a transition labeled 'II' leading to after_ii.

- From after_ii, there is another transition labeled 'II' leading back to after_fc (allowing loops).

- Additionally, there is a transition labeled 'CA' leading from after_fc to after_ca, but only when the investigation is complete.

But how to represent that the CA transition is only available after the loop? Perhaps in the Petri net, the CA transition has after_fc as input, but you can only fire it if there's no token in after_ii or something. Hmm, this might require more complex marking.

Alternatively, perhaps the CA transition is only available after the II loop is exited. So the process would be:

FC  II  FC  ... (loop) until the investigation is done, then proceed to CA. To model this, the CA transition would have after_fc as input, but only when there's no token in after_ii. But this requires using marks to control transitions.

This is getting quite complex. Perhaps the best approach is to model all possible transitions and places, then code them accordingly, even if it requires multiple transitions with the same name but different arcs.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, create the PetriNet object.

Then, add all the places:

places = [
    PetriNet.Place(name="start"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_cr"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_dv"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_fc"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_ii"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_ca"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_ap"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_p"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_n"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_cl"),
    # For RDS loop
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_rds"),
    # Maybe others?
]

Wait, the RDS step requires a place after_rds. So adding that.

Now, transitions:

1. CR: from start to after_cr.

2. DV: from after_cr to after_dv.

3. RDS: from after_dv to after_rds.

4. DV_recheck: from after_rds back to after_dv. (Labeled DV again?)

5. FC: from after_dv to after_fc.

Wait, but if after_dv is connected to after_fc via FC transition, then how do we choose between FC and RDS? Because after DV (after_dv), the next step could be FC or RDS. So the transitions from after_dv are FC and RDS. But in Petri nets, a place can have multiple outgoing transitions. So the after_dv place has two transitions: FC and RDS.

But the problem requires transitions to be labeled with the activity names. So FC and RDS are separate transitions with their own labels.

So transitions:

- FC: after_dv  after_fc.

- RDS: after_dv  after_rds.

Then, after RDS (after_rds), the next transition is DV_recheck (labeled DV again? Or another name?).

But the problem says transitions should be labeled with the activity names. The activity names are CR, DV, FC, etc. So the re-check after RDS would be another DV step, so the transition would be labeled DV again. But how to have two DV transitions with different input places.

So transitions:

- DV1: after_cr  after_dv (labeled 'DV').

- DV2: after_rds  after_dv (also labeled 'DV').

But in code, can we have two transitions with the same name but different input places? The problem allows this as long as the labels are correct.

Proceeding with this approach.

Continuing:

6. DV_recheck: after_rds  after_dv (labeled 'DV').

7. II: after_fc  after_ii (labeled 'II').

8. II_loop: after_ii  after_fc (labeled 'II' again? Or another name?).

Wait, the in-depth investigation can happen multiple times, so after II, you can go back to FC for another check. So the transition from after_ii back to after_fc would be labeled 'II' again. So transitions:

- II: after_fc  after_ii.

- II_loop: after_ii  after_fc (labeled 'II').

But again, same name but different arcs.

Alternatively, the transition from after_ii to after_fc is also labeled 'II'.

9. CA: after_fc  after_ca (labeled 'CA').

Wait, but CA is only taken after the investigation is done. So after the loop of II, you can proceed to CA. So the CA transition would have after_fc as input, but only when there's no token in after_ii? Hmm, perhaps the presence of a token in after_ii allows the loop to continue. So to exit the loop, the system must have no token in after_ii, allowing the CA transition to fire. But this requires using marks to control transitions.

Alternatively, the CA transition is only available after the II loop is exited. So the transitions would be:

After FC (after_fc), you can go to II (transition II leading to after_ii), and from after_ii you can go back to FC (after_fc) via another II transition. To exit the loop, perhaps there's another transition, like 'CA' which can be taken from after_fc when there's no token in after_ii.

Alternatively, the problem may allow us to model this with the CA transition having after_fc as input, and when there's no token in after_ii, the CA transition can fire. But this requires using marks to enforce this condition.

This is getting quite involved. Perhaps for the sake of time, I'll proceed with the transitions as outlined, even if it requires multiple transitions with the same name.

Continuing:

10. CA: after_fc  after_ca (labeled 'CA').

Wait, but CA is only taken after the investigation is done. So perhaps the CA transition can only be fired from after_fc when there's no token in after_ii. To model this, perhaps the CA transition has after_fc as input and after_ca as output, but can only fire if there's no token in after_ii. This requires using a mark.

Alternatively, perhaps the process flows such that after the II loop, you proceed to CA. So the CA transition is only available after exiting the loop. To model this, the II_loop transition (from after_ii to after_fc) could have a condition that allows it to loop, but also allows exiting via another path. Hmm, this might require more complex logic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to model the transitions without considering the exact conditions, just the possible paths. So the transitions are added, and the marks will handle the flow.

Continuing with transitions:

After CA (after_ca), the next step is Approval (AP).

11. AP: after_ca  after_ap (labeled 'AP').

But AP is only required if the amount exceeds a threshold. So after CA, the adjuster decides the amount. If it's over the threshold, you go to AP. Otherwise, you proceed to payment.

So after CA, there are two possible paths:

- If amount > threshold: CA  AP  Payment (P).

- Else: CA  Payment (P).

So the transitions after CA are:

- AP: after_ca  after_ap (labeled 'AP').

- P: after_ca  after_p (labeled 'P').

Wait, but how to choose between AP and P? The problem states that Approval is required only if the amount exceeds the threshold. So the presence of a token in a certain place (like a threshold place) would determine whether AP is taken. But perhaps for simplicity, we can model this with two transitions: AP and P, both from after_ca, but with different conditions. However, in Petri nets, transitions are deterministic. So perhaps we need to split this into two separate paths.

Alternatively, the P transition can be taken from both after_ca and after_ap. So:

- P: after_ca  after_p (if amount <= threshold).

- AP: after_ca  after_ap  after_p (if amount > threshold).

Wait, but then after AP, you still need to go to payment. So the path would be:

CA  AP  after_ap  then to payment.

So transitions:

- AP: after_ca  after_ap.

- Then, from after_ap, you can go to P.

- Also, from after_ca directly to P (if no approval needed).

So transitions:

12. P_direct: after_ca  after_p (labeled 'P').

13. AP: after_ca  after_ap (labeled 'AP').

14. P_after_ap: after_ap  after_p (labeled 'P').

This way, after CA, you can choose between P_direct or AP followed by P_after_ap.

Proceeding:

After payment (after_p), the next step is Notification (N), then Closure (CL).

15. N: after_p  after_n (labeled 'N').

16. CL: after_n  after_cl (labeled 'CL').

Finally, the final marking is after_cl.

Now, the initial marking is a token in 'start'.

The final marking is a token in 'after_cl'.

Now, let's code this step by step.

First, create the PetriNet and add all places and transitions.

But this is going to be quite involved. Let's proceed.

First, create the net:

net = PetriNet(name="insurance_claim_process")

Add all places:

places = [
    PetriNet.Place(name="start"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_cr"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_dv"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_fc"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_ii"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_ca"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_ap"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_p"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_n"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_cl"),
    PetriNet.Place(name="after_rds"),
]

for place in places:
    net.places.add(place)

Now add transitions:

transitions = [
    # CR
    PetriNet.Transition(name="CR", label="Claim Registration"),
    # DV
    PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification"),
    # RDS
    PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission"),
    # DV_recheck (from after_rds to after_dv)
    PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification (recheck)"),
    # FC
    PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Fraud Check"),
    # II
    PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="In-depth Investigation"),
    # II_loop (from after_ii back to FC)
    PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="In-depth Investigation (loop)"),
    # CA
    PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment"),
    # AP
    PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval"),
    # P_direct (from after_ca to after_p)
    PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment (direct)"),
    # AP then P
    PetriNet.Transition(name="P_after_ap", label="Payment after Approval"),
    # N
    PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification"),
    # CL
    PetriNet.Transition(name="CL", label="Closure"),
]

for trans in transitions:
    net.transitions.add(trans)

Now, connect the transitions between places.

Let's go step by step:

1. CR transition:

input_places = [net.places.get_or_add("start")]
output_places = [net.places.get_or_add("after_cr")]
net.add_transition(transitions[0], input_places, output_places)

Wait, perhaps better to reference the places by name and ensure they exist.

Alternatively, use the name to get the place objects.

But in code, perhaps:

start_place = net.places.get_or_add(PetriNet.Place(name="start"))
after_cr_place = net.places.get_or_add(PetriNet.Place(name="after_cr"))

trans = transitions[0]
net.add_transition(trans, [start_place], [after_cr_place])

Similarly for other transitions.

But this will be tedious. Alternatively, use the place names and the net's add_place method.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written as follows:

# CR transition
net.add_transition(
    name="CR",
    label="Claim Registration",
    places=["start", "after_cr"],
    arcs=[("start", "out", "after_cr", "in")]
)

Wait, perhaps using the petri_utils functions like add_arc_from_to.

Alternatively, perhaps using the following approach for each transition:

For each transition in the transitions list, define its input and output places.

But this requires knowing the input and output places for each transition.

Let me try to code each transition's connections:

1. CR:

input: start  output: after_cr.

net.add_transition(
    transitions[0],
    input_places=[net.places.get_or_add(name) for name in ["start"]],
    output_places=[net.places.get_or_add(name) for name in ["after_cr"]]
)

But perhaps it's easier to use the names directly.

Alternatively, use the following code structure:

# Define all places first
places_dict = {
    "start": PetriNet.Place(name="start"),
    "after_cr": PetriNet.Place(name="after_cr"),
    "after_dv": PetriNet.Place(name="after_dv"),
    "after_fc": PetriNet.Place(name="after_fc"),
    "after_ii": PetriNet.Place(name="after_ii"),
    "after_ca": PetriNet.Place(name="after_ca"),
    "after_ap": PetriNet.Place(name="after_ap"),
    "after_p": PetriNet.Place(name="after_p"),
    "after_n": PetriNet.Place(name="after_n"),
    "after_cl": PetriNet.Place(name="after_cl"),
    "after_rds": PetriNet.Place(name="after_rds"),
}

for name in places_dict:
    net.places.add(places_dict[name])

Then, for each transition, define the input and output places by name.

Now, transitions:

transitions_dict = [
    {
        "name": "CR",
        "label": "Claim Registration",
        "input": ["start"],
        "output": ["after_cr"]
    },
    {
        "name": "DV",
        "label": "Document Verification",
        "input": ["after_cr"],
        "output": ["after_dv"]
    },
    {
        "name": "RDS",
        "label": "Re-Document Submission",
        "input": ["after_dv"],
        "output": ["after_rds"]
    },
    {
        "name": "DV",  # recheck
        "label": "Document Verification (recheck)",
        "input": ["after_rds"],
        "output": ["after_dv"]
    },
    {
        "name": "FC",
        "label": "Fraud Check",
        "input": ["after_dv"],
        "output": ["after_fc"]
    },
    {
        "name": "II",
        "label": "In-depth Investigation",
        "input": ["after_fc"],
        "output": ["after_ii"]
    },
    {
        "name": "II",  # loop back
        "label": "In-depth Investigation (loop)",
        "input": ["after_ii"],
        "output": ["after_fc"]
    },
    {
        "name": "CA",
        "label": "Claim Assessment",
        "input": ["after_fc"],
        "output": ["after_ca"]
    },
    {
        "name": "AP",
        "label": "Approval",
        "input": ["after_ca"],
        "output": ["after_ap"]
    },
    {
        "name": "P",
        "label": "Payment (direct)",
        "input": ["after_ca"],
        "output": ["after_p"]
    },
    {
        "name": "P_after_ap",
        "label": "Payment after Approval",
        "input": ["after_ap"],
        "output": ["after_p"]
    },
    {
        "name": "N",
        "label": "Notification",
        "input": ["after_p"],
        "output": ["after_n"]
    },
    {
        "name": "CL",
        "label": "Closure",
        "input": ["after_n"],
        "output": ["after_cl"]
    },
]

Wait, but the CA transition's input is after_fc, but after FC, you can go to II or CA. So the CA transition is available from after_fc. However, the II transitions can loop back to after_fc, allowing multiple investigations. So the CA transition can only be fired when there's no token in after_ii, or when the investigation is complete. But this requires using marks.

Hmm, perhaps the CA transition should have after_fc as input, but also requires that there's no token in after_ii. To model this, we can use a mark that is consumed when the investigation is done.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the exact conditions and just model the possible transitions, even if they can be fired in any order. However, this might not accurately represent the process flow.

Alternatively, perhaps the II transitions can only be taken if there's a token in a certain place, but this requires more complex marking.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps for the purpose of this exercise, we can proceed with the transitions as defined, even if they allow some paths that may not be strictly correct, but capture the general structure.

Proceeding with the code:

for trans_info in transitions_dict:
    trans = transitions[trans_info["name"]]  # Wait, need to map name to transition index
    # Wait, the transitions_dict is a list of dictionaries, each with 'name' key.
    # So perhaps better to loop through the transitions_dict and create each transition.

Wait, perhaps the transitions_dict is a list of dictionaries, each defining a transition's parameters. So for each entry in transitions_dict:

for trans_info in transitions_dict:
    trans = PetriNet.Transition(name=trans_info["name"], label=trans_info["label"])
    net.transitions.add(trans)
    # Now add the arc from input to output
    inputs = [net.places.get_or_add(name) for name in trans_info["input"]]
    outputs = [net.places.get_or_add(name) for name in trans_info["output"]]
    net.add_transition(trans, inputs, outputs)

Wait, but the add_transition method may require the transition object, input places, and output places. So perhaps:

for trans_info in transitions_dict:
    trans = PetriNet.Transition(name=trans_info["name"], label=trans_info["label"])
    net.transitions.add(trans)
    inputs = [net.places.get_or_add(name) for name in trans_info["input"]]
    outputs = [net.places.get_or_add(name) for name in trans_info["output"]]
    net.add_transition(trans, inputs, outputs)

This way, each transition is added with its input and output places.

Now, the transitions_dict entries need to have the correct input and output names.

Let me recheck each transition's input and output:

1. CR: input ["start"], output ["after_cr"].

2. DV: input ["after_cr"], output ["after_dv"].

3. RDS: input ["after_dv"], output ["after_rds"].

4. DV_recheck (second DV transition): input ["after_rds"], output ["after_dv"].

5. FC: input ["after_dv"], output ["after_fc"].

Wait, but the FC transition's input is after_dv, but after DV, the system can also go to RDS. So the FC transition is an alternative path from after_dv. So the after_dv place has two outgoing transitions: FC and RDS. That's allowed in Petri nets.

6. II: input ["after_fc"], output ["after_ii"].

7. II_loop: input ["after_ii"], output ["after_fc"].

8. CA: input ["after_fc"], output ["after_ca"].

Wait, but after FC (after_fc), the system can go to II or CA. So the CA transition is available from after_fc, but the II transitions allow looping back to after_fc. So the CA transition can only be fired if there's no token in after_ii. To model this, perhaps the CA transition has after_fc as input and after_ca as output, but requires that there's no token in after_ii. This requires using a mark.

Alternatively, perhaps the CA transition is only available after the II loop is exited. But without marks, it's hard to model this condition.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the exact conditions and just model the transitions as possible paths, even if they can be fired in any order. So the code will include all transitions, and the marks can be set accordingly.

Continuing with the transitions_dict entries:

8. CA: input ["after_fc"], output ["after_ca"].

9. AP: input ["after_ca"], output ["after_ap"].

10. P_direct: input ["after_ca"], output ["after_p"].

11. P_after_ap: input ["after_ap"], output ["after_p"].

12. N: input ["after_p"], output ["after_n"].

13. CL: input ["after_n"], output ["after_cl"].

Now, the transitions_dict should have all these entries.

Wait, the CA transition's input is after_fc, but after FC, the system can go to II or CA. So the CA transition is available from after_fc. The II transitions allow looping back to after_fc. So the CA transition can be fired from after_fc even if there's a token in after_ii. This might not be correct, but for the sake of the example, we'll proceed.

Now, the initial marking is a token in "start".

The final marking is a token in "after_cl".

Now, the code for the initial and final markings:

im = Marking()
im[net.places.get_or_add(name="start")] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[net.places.get_or_add(name="after_cl")] = 1

But in code, perhaps:

start_place = net.places.get_or_add(PetriNet.Place(name="start"))
cl_place = net.places.get_or_add(PetriNet.Place(name="after_cl"))

im = Marking()
im[start_place] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[cl_place] = 1

Putting it all together, the code would look like this:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet(name="insurance_claim_process")

# Define all places
places_dict = {

for name in places_dict:
    net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name=name))

# Define transitions and their connections
transitions_dict = [
    {

    },
    {

        "label": "Notification",
        "input": ["after_p"],
        "output": ["after_n"]
    },

        "name": "CL",
        "label": "Closure",
        "input": ["after_n"],
        "output": ["after_cl"]
    },
]

for trans_info in transitions_dict:
    trans = PetriNet.Transition(name=trans_info["name"], label=trans_info["label"])
    net.transitions.add(trans)
    inputs = [net.places.get_or_add(name=name) for name in trans_info["input"]]
    outputs = [net.places.get_or_add(name=name) for name in trans_info["output"]]
    net.add_transition(trans, inputs, outputs)

# Define initial and final markings
start_place = net.places.get_or_add(name="start")
cl_place = net.places.get_or_add(name="after_cl")

im = Marking()
im[start_place] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[cl_place] = 1

This code should create the Petri net with all the required places and transitions. However, there might be issues with transitions that have the same name but different arcs. For example, the two DV transitions with the same name but different input places. In Petri net terms, this is allowed as long as they are different transitions (different objects), even if they share the same name. The problem requires transitions to be labeled with the activity names, so this should be acceptable.

Additionally, the CA transition's input is after_fc, but after FC, the system can go to II or CA. The II transitions allow looping back to FC, so the CA transition can be fired from after_fc even if there's a token in after_ii. This might not be accurate, but without using marks to control the flow, it's difficult to model the exact conditions.

The final marking is a token in after_cl, which is the end state after closure.

This code should fulfill the problem's requirements, even if some details like the exact handling of loops and decision points are simplified.
</thought>

To solve this problem, we need to construct an accepting Petri net that models the insurance claim management process with possible loops and decision points. The Petri net should include transitions labeled with the activity names and places representing the states between these activities. The initial marking should represent a new claim arriving, and the final marking should represent a closed claim.

### Approach
1. **Identify Places and Transitions**: Define all places (states) and transitions (activities) based on the process steps and possible loops.
2. **Model Loops and Decision Points**: Handle loops such as re-document submission (RDS) and in-depth investigation (II) by creating transitions that allow looping back to previous states.
3. **Set Initial and Final Markings**: The initial marking places a token in the start place, and the final marking places a token in the closed claim place.

### Explanation
1. **Places**: The places represent the states after each activity. For example, "start" is the initial state, and "after_cl" is the final closed state.
2. **Transitions**: Each transition corresponds to an activity or a loop step. Transitions like "DV" (Document Verification) and "DV" (Document Verification Re-check) handle the loop by allowing re-verification after re-submission.
3. **Loops and Decision Points**: The loops for re-document submission (RDS) and in-depth investigation (II) are modeled using transitions that loop back to previous states. The decision at the claim assessment (CA) to proceed to approval or payment is handled by separate transitions for direct payment and post-approval payment.
4. **Markings**: The initial marking starts with a token in the "start" place, and the final marking ends with a token in the "after_cl" place, ensuring the process reaches the correct terminal state.
