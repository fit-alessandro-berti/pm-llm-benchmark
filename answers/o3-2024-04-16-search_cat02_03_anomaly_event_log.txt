Below is a brief reminder of the “text-book” Procure-to-Pay (P2P) order of events.  
1. Create Purchase Requisition (PR)  
2. Approve PR  
3. Issue / transmit Purchase Order (PO) to the vendor  
4. Vendor ships; company performs Goods Receipt (GR)  
5. Vendor sends Invoice  
6. Three-way match (Invoice  PO  GR)  
7. Release / execute Payment  
8. Administrative close

With that reference model in mind, each case was checked for (a) activities that occur in an impossible or high-risk order, (b) steps that are missing, and (c) steps that occur but far earlier or later than expected.  


CASE-BY-CASE OBSERVATIONS

Case 1001 – “Clean” reference case  
• All activities occur in the expected order.  
• Only a two-day gap between goods receipt (02 Feb) and invoice arrival (same day) – normal.  
 No anomaly.

Case 1002 – Multiple control violations  
1. PO before PR approval  
   – The PO is issued at 08:40, while the PR is not approved until two days later (03 Feb 08:00).  
   – This bypasses the authorization control that prevents unapproved spend.

2. Invoice and Payment before goods receipt and PR approval  
   – Vendor Invoice Received (03 Feb 07:00) and Release Payment (03 Feb 07:15) both occur  
     • before the PR is approved, and  
     • before the goods are even received (GR on 04 Feb).  
   – Paying before evidence of delivery and without an approved budget is a classic fraud / error risk (e.g., duplicate or fictitious invoices).

3. Three-way match after payment  
   – “Match Invoice to PO” is not done until 05 Feb, two days after payment is released.  
   – This defeats the whole purpose of the three-way match as a preventive control; it has been reduced to a detective control at best.

Case 1003 – Early payment, late documentation  
1. Payment precedes both Invoice and Goods Receipt  
   – Release Payment on 08 Feb, while invoice is only received on 09 Feb and goods on 10 Feb.  
   – The company is paying without an invoice or delivery proof—purely on the PO. That exposes it to non-delivery risk and weakens cash-flow management.

2. Match occurs after both invoice and goods (11 Feb) yet still after payment  
   – Again, the three-way match is downgraded from a gatekeeper to an after-the-fact reconciliation.

Case 1004 – “Maverick” receiving; PO created after the fact  
1. Goods Receipt before PO issuance  
   – GR on 06 Feb 09:00, PO not issued until 06 Feb 09:15 (15 minutes later).  
   – Receiving items before formal ordering suggests the vendor was engaged informally (phone, e-mail). This is called “maverick buying” and undermines pricing, contractual, and liability protections.

2. Payment extremely fast (within 1 day) and before formal lead-time for invoice review  
   – Invoice at 07 Feb 08:00; payment released 30 minutes later at 09:00.  
   – Even if sequence (Invoice  Match  Pay) is technically correct, the cycle is so compressed that reviewers could not reasonably validate quantity, price, or quality discrepancies.


WHY THESE PATTERNS ARE PROBLEMATIC

• Governance & Authorization: Issuing a PO before the PR is approved (Cases 1002, 1004) overrides budgetary controls and allows unapproved spend.  
• Financial Exposure: Paying before receiving goods or even an invoice (Cases 1002, 1003) risks paying for undelivered or incorrect items, harms working capital, and can facilitate fraud.  
• Control Effectiveness: Conducting the three-way match after payment (Cases 1002, 1003) converts a preventive control into a detective one, meaning problems are discovered only after cash has left the company.  
• Audit & Compliance: Receiving goods before a PO exists (Case 1004) violates SOX/IFRS/GAAP expectations for auditable purchase commitments and can lead to findings in both internal and external audits.  
• Master-data & segregation-of-duties risks: Speed-run scenarios where invoice, match, and payment all happen within minutes (Case 1004) indicate either automation with inadequate exception handling or manual override of normal approval queues.


SUMMARY OF ANOMALIES
• Case 1001: None (benchmark).  
• Case 1002: PO before approval; invoice & payment before GR and before approval; three-way match after payment.  
• Case 1003: Payment before invoice & GR; three-way match after payment.  
• Case 1004: GR before PO (maverick purchase); payment released almost immediately after invoice; compressed review window.

Addressing these anomalies usually involves reinforcing approval workflows, enforcing “no invoice/no goods receipt  no payment,” tightening matching tolerances, and educating requesters on the need for PR/PO discipline before committing the company’s money.
