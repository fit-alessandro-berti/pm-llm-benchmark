 Sure, here are the opposite concepts and more general concepts for the given Petri net related concepts:

1. Opposite of Source Place:
A source place is a place in a Petri net with no incoming transitions. The opposite concept would be a *sink place*, which is a place with no outgoing transitions.

A sink place is useful in modeling situations where tokens are removed from the system, such as in a deadlock situation.

2. Opposite of Immediate Transition:
An immediate transition is a transition that can fire as soon as it becomes enabled, without any delay. The opposite concept would be a *timed transition*, which takes a certain amount of time to fire after it becomes enabled.

Timed transitions are useful in modeling systems where timing is important, such as in real-time systems.

3. Opposite of Live Transition:
A live transition is a transition that can always be fired, provided there are sufficient tokens in its input places. The opposite concept would be a *dead transition*, which cannot be fired under any circumstances.

A dead transition is useful in modeling situations where a particular action is impossible, such as in a system with inconsistent input data.

4. Opposite of Bounded Net:
A bounded net is a Petri net where the number of tokens in each place is finite. The opposite concept would be an *unbounded net*, where the number of tokens in at least one place can grow without bound.

Unbounded nets are useful in modeling systems with unlimited resources, such as a network router with an unlimited buffer.

5. Opposite of Free Choice Net:
A free choice net is a Petri net where each transition has exactly one input place, or all of its input places are shared with other transitions. The opposite concept would be a *non-free choice net*, where some transitions have multiple input places that are not shared with other transitions.

Non-free choice nets are useful in modeling systems with conflicts, where multiple actions are mutually exclusive.
