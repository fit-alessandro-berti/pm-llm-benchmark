Sure! Below is a realistic **temporal profile dictionary** for the global supply chain process, based on typical timelines in high-tech manufacturing across geographically distributed operations (e.g., components sourced from Asia, assembly in multiple regions, distribution to North America/Europe).

I’ve included **direct** and **indirect** sequential pairs, estimating average durations and standard deviations in **seconds**, grounded in real-world logistics, but allowing natural variability due to customs, quality bottlenecks, transport modes, and demand fluctuations.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Immediate process steps
    ('SS', 'OP'): (43200, 21600),        # Supplier selection to order placed: ~12±6 hrs decision & docs
    ('OP', 'RC'): (518400, 172800),      # Order to receive components: 6±2 days (global shipping)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 3600),          # Receive to inspection: next working day (~2±1 hrs)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (18000, 14400),        # Inspection to assembly: 5±4 hrs (batch processing)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (10800, 7200),         # Assembly to testing: 3±2 hrs (shift coordination)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 1800),          # Pass test to packaging: 1±0.5 hrs
    ('PK', 'WS'): (1800, 1800),          # Packaging to warehouse storage: ~30 min, up to 1 hr
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 172800),      # Storage to distribution: highly variable (~2±2 days)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 259200),      # Distribution to after-sales: support starts in a week ±3 days

    # Multi-step delays
    ('SS', 'RC'): (576000, 180000),      # Selection to receiving: 6.7±5 days (incl. order processing)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (540000, 144000),      # Order to assembly: ~6.3±1.7 days (receipt + inspection + setup)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (16200, 9000),         # Post-inspection to packaging: ~4.5±2.5 hrs
    ('CA', 'DT'): (207000, 86400),       # Assembly done to shipping: ~2.4±1 day (test, pack, store, wait)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (777600, 345600),      # Packaging to after-sales trigger: ~9±4 days
    ('RC', 'PT'): (342000, 72000),       # Component receipt to product test: ~4±0.8 days
    ('OP', 'DT'): (777600, 207360),      # Order placed to final shipment: ~9±2.4 days
    ('SS', 'DT'): (864000, 259200),      # End-to-end pre-shipment timeline: ~10±3 days
    ('PT', 'AS'): (720000, 302400),      # Testing complete to after-sales: ~8.3±3.5 days
    ('CA', 'WS'): (185400, 75600),       # Assembly to storage: ~2.2±0.9 days

    # Long-range but meaningful pairs
    ('SS', 'AS'): (1555200, 432000),     # Full lifecycle: supplier selection to support (~18±5 days)
    ('RC', 'WS'): (154800, 68400),       # Components in to product stored: ~1.8±0.8 days
    ('QI', 'WS'): (147600, 64800),       # After passing inspection to storage: ~1.7±0.75 days
    ('OP', 'PK'): (594000, 129600),      # From order to final package: ~6.9±1.5 days
}
```

### Notes on Estimation:
- **Time units**: All values are in **seconds**.
- **Variability sources**: 
  - Air vs. sea freight, customs delays, weekend processing lags
  - Assembly line throughput and test rig availability
  - Distribution hub scheduling (e.g., weekly trucking routes)
- **ZETA deviations**: With a typical `ZETA = 3`, any observed interval beyond `±3` would flag as a deviation (e.g., an order-to-receive time over 10 days when average is 6 might indicate a supply chain disruption).

Would you like me to generate synthetic event logs based on this profile or visualize the critical paths?
