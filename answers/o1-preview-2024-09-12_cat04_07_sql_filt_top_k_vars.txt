To accomplish your task, we can use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in DuckDB to structure our query into logical steps. Here's the SQL query that performs all the required operations:

```sql
WITH seq_per_case AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        string_agg(activity, '|' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS num_cases
    FROM
        seq_per_case
    GROUP BY
        activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM
        variant_counts
    ORDER BY
        num_cases DESC
    LIMIT
        K  -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
),
cases_in_top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM
        seq_per_case
    WHERE
        activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    event_log
WHERE
    case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_in_top_k_variants);
```

**Explanation of the query:**

1. **Extract the ordered sequence of activities per case:**

   The first CTE, `seq_per_case`, computes the sequence of activities for each `case_id` by concatenating the activities in order of their `timestamp`. This is done using the `string_agg` function with an `ORDER BY` clause:

   ```sql
   WITH seq_per_case AS (
       SELECT
           case_id,
           string_agg(activity, '|' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
       FROM
           event_log
       GROUP BY
           case_id
   )
   ```

2. **Aggregate and count cases per variant:**

   The second CTE, `variant_counts`, groups the cases by their `activity_sequence` and counts the number of cases for each unique sequence:

   ```sql
   variant_counts AS (
       SELECT
           activity_sequence,
           COUNT(*) AS num_cases
       FROM
           seq_per_case
       GROUP BY
           activity_sequence
   )
   ```

3. **Determine the top K variants by frequency:**

   The third CTE, `top_k_variants`, selects the top `K` variants based on the frequency (`num_cases`):

   ```sql
   top_k_variants AS (
       SELECT
           activity_sequence
       FROM
           variant_counts
       ORDER BY
           num_cases DESC
       LIMIT
           K  -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
   )
   ```

   *Note:* Replace `K` with the number of top variants you are interested in.

4. **Filter down to cases belonging to the top K variants:**

   The fourth CTE, `cases_in_top_k_variants`, retrieves all `case_id`s that have an `activity_sequence` matching one of the top K variants:

   ```sql
   cases_in_top_k_variants AS (
       SELECT
           case_id
       FROM
           seq_per_case
       WHERE
           activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
   )
   ```

5. **Return the corresponding events from those filtered cases:**

   Finally, the main query selects all events from the original `event_log` that belong to the cases identified in the previous step:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       *
   FROM
       event_log
   WHERE
       case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_in_top_k_variants);
   ```

**Summary of Steps:**

- **Step 1:** Create a sequence of activities for each case by ordering the activities based on the timestamp.
- **Step 2:** Group these sequences to identify unique process variants and count the number of cases for each variant.
- **Step 3:** Identify the top K variants based on the frequency of cases.
- **Step 4:** Filter the original event log to include only events from cases that are part of these top K variants.

**Usage:**

- Replace `K` in the query with the number of top variants you want to retrieve.
- This query will return all events from the `event_log` that belong to cases which are part of the top K variants, excluding all other cases.

**Example:**

If you wanted to retrieve the top 3 variants, you would modify the `LIMIT` clause in the `top_k_variants` CTE:

```sql
LIMIT 3  -- Retrieves the top 3 variants by frequency
```

**Note:**

- Ensure that your `event_log` table has appropriate indexes on `case_id` and `timestamp` for optimal performance.
- The `string_agg` function concatenates the activities with a delimiter (`'|'` in this case); you can choose a different delimiter if needed.

This query efficiently processes the event log data to extract the required information while adhering to the order of events and grouping based on activity sequences.
