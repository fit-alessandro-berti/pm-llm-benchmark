Below is one way to aggregate the low-level events into a set of coherent, high-level process steps. The grouping was done by looking at:

- **Temporal Order:** Events that occur sequentially in a tightly bound time frame.
- **Resource/Agent Types:** Similar resources (e.g., operators for handling or robots for alignment) were often involved in related steps.
- **Logical Process Flow:** Actions that prepare the material, build the component, finish the surface, and finally check quality naturally form distinct phases.

Based on these criteria, here is a structured representation of the proposed high-level activities:

---

### 1. Material Preparation

**Constituent Low-Level Events:**
- **Retrieve raw metal sheet** (Operator A – PartID information)
- **Scan barcode** (Operator A – Identification data)
- **Place metal sheet on table** (Operator A – Positioning on TableID)
- **Align metal sheet** (Robot Arm #2 – Ensuring proper alignment)
- **Preheat metal sheet** (Heating Unit #1 – Achieving target temperature)

**Rationale:**
These events all focus on getting the raw material ready for processing. The steps include identification, physical placement, precise alignment, and pre-conditioning (heating) of the metal sheet. Grouping them as “Material Preparation” reflects that they set up the workpiece for the subsequent welding/assembly operations.

### 2. Welding Assembly

**Constituent Low-Level Events:**
- **Pick up welding tool** (Operator B – Tool preparation)
- **Weld corner A** (Operator B – Execution of a spot weld)
- **Weld corner B** (Operator B – Execution of a spot weld)
- **Measure weld integrity** (Quality Sensor #1 – Immediate quality check)

**Rationale:**
This set of events involves the actual joining of the pre-prepared material. The operator picks up the necessary tool, executes welding on multiple corners, and then performs an in-line quality check (via the weld integrity measurement) to ensure that the welds meet process standards. Thus, this phase is best described as “Welding Assembly” because it combines assembly with an immediate verification of quality in the weld.

### 3. Finishing Process (Coating Application)

**Constituent Low-Level Events:**
- **Apply protective coating** (Coating Unit #3 – Application of a finish)
- **Dry coating** (Heating Unit #2 – Curing/drying the coating)

**Rationale:**
After assembly, the product undergoes a finishing step where a protective coating is applied. The subsequent drying ensures that the coating adheres and cures properly. This stage adds a layer of durability and protection to the product. Grouping these events under “Finishing Process (Coating Application)” clearly delineates them from the earlier assembly and preparation steps.

### 4. Final Quality Inspection

**Constituent Low-Level Event:**
- **Visual check** (Operator C – Final inspection)

**Rationale:**
This step represents the final verification stage. After the manufacturing and finishing processes are complete, a visual inspection confirms that the product meets the quality standards required for further use or shipment. Placing this as a separate high-level activity emphasizes its role as the last quality assurance checkpoint in the workflow.

### Summary of the Aggregated High-Level Process Steps

1. **Material Preparation:**  
   Preparing the raw metal sheet through retrieval, identification, positioning, alignment, and preheating.

2. **Welding Assembly:**  
   Assembling the product via welding operations with an immediate integrity check to verify the quality of the welds.

3. **Finishing Process (Coating Application):**  
   Applying and curing a protective coating to enhance product durability.

4. **Final Quality Inspection:**  
   Conducting a final visual check to ensure the product meets quality standards before it exits the process.

This structured approach not only makes the manufacturing workflow easier to understand but also highlights the logical progression from raw material handling through assembly, finishing, and final quality assurance.
