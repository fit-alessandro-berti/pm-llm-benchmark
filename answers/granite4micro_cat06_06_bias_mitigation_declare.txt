### Explanation of Added Constraints

- **Coexistence Constraint:**  
  The `coexistence` constraint ensures that if a loan application results in a final decision to reject for applicants identified as minorities (`Reject_Minority`), there must be an accompanying `ManualReview`. This step acts as a safeguard, ensuring that decisions are not solely based on biased attributes without human oversight.

- **Response Constraints:**  
  The `response` constraint mandates that after an event disclosing sensitive information (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`), the process must first undergo a `BiasMitigationCheck` before any final decision is made. This ensures that decisions are not immediately influenced by sensitive attributes, promoting fairness.

- **Succession Constraints:**  
  The `succession` constraint forces a `BiasMitigationCheck` to occur immediately before certain decisions (like `FinalDecision`). This reinforces the idea that decisions should be preceded by checks aimed at mitigating bias.

- **Non-coexistence and Non-succession Constraints:**  
  These constraints prohibit direct transitions from sensitive attribute events to decision outcomes without intermediate steps. For example, a `Reject` outcome cannot directly follow an event like `CheckApplicantRace` without first passing through a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This prevents immediate biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes.

These added constraints collectively work towards reducing bias in the loan application process by ensuring that decisions are not solely dependent on potentially discriminatory factors and that there is adequate human review and mitigation steps before final outcomes are determined.
