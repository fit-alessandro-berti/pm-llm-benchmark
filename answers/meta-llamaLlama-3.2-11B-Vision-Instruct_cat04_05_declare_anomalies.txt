Analyzing the constraints of the proposed process model, I have identified some anomalies:

1. **Response and Co-Existence Contradiction**: 
   - 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled' are related by both Response and Co-Existence constraints.
   - However, 'Request Payment' can be executed only once (Exactly 1 constraint), but 'Payment Handled' can be executed multiple times (by Co-Existence with 'Request Payment').
   This creates a conflict as 'Request Payment' cannot be triggered again after 'Payment Handled' if 'Request Payment' is already executed once.

2. **Existence and Exactly 1 Conflict**: 
   - 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', and 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' are related by both Existence and Exactly 1 constraints.
   - Since these activities are marked as 'Exactly 1', this means they can only be executed once, which contradicts the Existence constraint that allows them to be executed at least once.

3. **Non Co-Existence and Co-Existence Contradiction**: 
   - 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' is related by Non Co-Existence with 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment', and 'Payment Handled'.
   - However, 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' is also related by Co-Existence with 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment', and 'Payment Handled'.
   This creates a conflict as these activities should not co-exist according to the Non Co-Existence constraint.

4. **Alternate Succession and Succession Conflict**: 
   - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' is related by Alternate Succession with 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled'.
   - However, 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' is also related by Succession with 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled'.
   This creates a conflict as Succession implies that these activities should not alternate, which contradicts the Alternate Succession constraint.

5. **Chain Succession and Succession Conflict**: 
   - 'Request Payment' is related by Chain Succession with 'Payment Handled'.
   - However, 'Request Payment' is also related by Succession with 'Payment Handled'.
   This creates a conflict as Chain Succession implies a direct-follows relation, which contradicts the Succession constraint.
