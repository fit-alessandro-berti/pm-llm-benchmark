I'll analyze each case against the normative rules and desiderata to identify violations and deviations.

## **Part 1: Normative Rule Violations (Strict Rules)**

### **Case 1: COMPLIANT**
-  Follows correct sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
-  All ordering rules respected
-  Correctly finalizes documentation after approval before closing

### **Case 2: VIOLATES NORMATIVE RULES**
**Violations identified:**
1. **Ordering violation**: Risk Assessment (08:20) performed before Credit Check (09:00)
   - This directly violates the rule: "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment"
2. **Contradictory action**: Finalize Documentation performed after a rejection
   - This violates the rule: "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case"

### **Case 3: COMPLIANT**
-  Follows correct sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
-  All ordering rules respected
-  Correctly finalizes documentation after approval before closing

## **Part 2: Desiderata Violations (Recommended Practices)**

### **Case 1: MEETS ALL DESIDERATA**
-  Credit Check within 24 hours (30 minutes after application)
-  Applicant informed within 48 hours (2 hours after decision)
-  No Follow-up Call recorded (but this is only encouraged, not required)

### **Case 2: DESIDERATA ANALYSIS**
-  Credit Check timing would have been acceptable (20 minutes after application)
-  Applicant would have been informed promptly (if this step had occurred properly)
-  No Follow-up Call recorded
- **Note**: The normative violations overshadow desiderata concerns

### **Case 3: VIOLATES DESIDERATA**
**Desiderata deviations identified:**
1. **Delayed Credit Check**: Performed 25 hours after application (exceeded 24-hour recommendation)
2. **Delayed Applicant Notification**: Informed 75 hours after loan decision (exceeded 48-hour recommendation)
3. **Missing Follow-up Call**: No follow-up call performed before case closure

## **Summary and Interpretations**

### **Severity Assessment:**
- **Case 1**: Excellent compliance with minor desiderata gap (missing follow-up call)
- **Case 2**: **Serious violations** - requires process correction and possibly case review
- **Case 3**: Good normative compliance but **suboptimal timing** - may indicate resource constraints

### **Possible Justifications:**
- **Case 3 delays**: Could be attributed to weekend/holiday periods, staff availability, or workload management
- **Missing follow-up calls**: Might indicate resource prioritization or that informal communication occurred outside the logged process
- **Case 2 violations**: Likely indicate training issues, system problems, or process misunderstanding requiring immediate attention

### **Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate**: Review Case 2 for potential process redesign and staff retraining
2. **Process improvement**: Implement timing alerts for desiderata compliance
3. **Monitoring**: Establish regular auditing to catch normative violations early
4. **Documentation**: Consider making follow-up calls more structured if customer satisfaction is a priority
