<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this DuckDB SQL query problem. Let me read the prompt again and break it down step by step.

First, the task is to construct a SQL query that does a few things. It needs to determine the sequence of activities for each case_id, group cases by their activity sequences to find unique process variants, count how many cases each variant has, and then return all events from cases that are in the top K variants by frequency. Cases not in the top K should be excluded.

Alright, so the first thing I need to do is figure out how to extract the ordered sequence of activities per case. The event_log table has case_id, activity, and timestamp. So, for each case_id, I need to get all the activities in the order they were recorded, which is sorted by timestamp.

In SQL, to get the ordered sequence, I can use a window function. Since each case is a process instance, I can use the CASE WHEN clause to group activities by case_id and then order them by timestamp. Then, using a window function like ROW_NUMBER() can help assign a rank to each activity within the case, so I can list them in order.

So, the ordered sequence would be something like: select case_id, activity from event_log where case_id is in ... but ordered by timestamp. But since I need the sequence per case, I think using a window function is the way to go.

Next, I need to group cases by their complete activity sequence. That means for each case, I have a list of activities in order, and I need to group similar lists together as unique variants. This sounds a bit tricky because in SQL, grouping by a list isn't straightforward. Maybe I can convert the list of activities into a string, like a JSON array or something, and then group by that.

Wait, but for grouping, I need a way to represent each unique sequence as a single value. One approach is to use a window function to get the sequence as a comma-separated string and then use that as a key in a GROUP BY clause.

Alternatively, I could use a recursive CTE to generate a string representation of the activity sequence and then group by that. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet. Maybe there's a better way.

After grouping, I need to count how many cases correspond to each variant. That seems straightforward with a COUNT() function.

Then, I have to determine the top K variants by frequency. So I need to rank the variants based on the number of cases they have. The top K would be the ones with the highest counts.

Once I have the top K variants, I need to filter the original event log to include only events from cases that are part of these top K variants. So, it's like a join or a filter where the case_id is in the list of top K cases.

Finally, I need to return all events from these filtered cases. So the result should include all the activities and timestamps for these cases, ordered by their activity sequence.

Putting this together, I think the query will have to:

1. For each case_id, get the ordered list of activities.
2. Convert this ordered list into a unique identifier for the variant.
3. Group by this identifier and count the number of cases per variant.
4. Sort these variants by their count in descending order.
5. Take the top K variants.
6. Select all events where the case_id is in any of the top K variants.

But how do I implement steps 2-3 in SQL? Maybe using a window function to get the sequence and then using a string aggregation to group them.

Alternatively, perhaps using a pivot table approach where each row represents a variant and the columns represent the activities in order, but that might be too complex.

Wait, another approach: for each case, generate a string that represents the activity sequence, like "activity1,activity2,activity3". Then, group by this string and count the number of cases per string.

Yes, that makes sense. So, in SQL, I can use a window function to get the ordered activities and then use STRING_AGG() to concatenate them into a single string.

So, the steps in SQL would be:

- Use a window function to get the ordered list of activities for each case.
- For each case, generate a key by concatenating the ordered activities into a string.
- Group by this key and count the number of cases per key.
- Order these groups by their count in descending order.
- Select the top K groups.
- Then, select all events where the case_id is in any of the top K keys.

But wait, how do I get the ordered activities? Let me think about the window function.

I can use ROW_NUMBER() to assign a rank to each activity within the same case. So for each case, the activities are ordered by timestamp, and each activity gets a row number. Then, for each case, I can filter where the row number is 1,2,3,... and concatenate the activity names in order.

Alternatively, I can use a recursive query to build the ordered list.

But perhaps a better way is to use the window function with ORDER BY timestamp and then use the results to create the sequence.

Wait, maybe I can use the following approach:

1. Create a window for each case that orders by timestamp and assigns a row number to each activity. So, for each case, the activities are ordered, and each activity has a row number.

2. Then, for each case, select the activities where the row number is in order (like 1,2,3,...) and concatenate them into a string.

3. Now, group by this string to get unique variants.

But I'm not sure how to implement this in a single query. Maybe using a recursive CTE to build the string.

Alternatively, maybe using a string_agg function with a subquery that orders the activities by timestamp and row number.

Wait, here's an idea: for each case_id, I can select the activities and timestamp, then order them by timestamp, and then use a window function to get the row number, and then for each activity, if it's the first, second, etc., include it in the string.

But this might be too slow if there are a lot of cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a correlated subquery that, for each case_id, returns the ordered list of activities, and then aggregate that into a string.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Another thought: Maybe use a pivot table where each row represents a case_id, and the columns represent the activities in order. But that's probably not feasible since the number of activities can vary.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a window function to get the ordered sequence and then aggregate into a string.

So, here's a possible structure:

WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
           row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS row_num
    FROM event_log
)
, activity_sequence AS (
    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, ',') AS activity_sequence
    FROM ordered_activities
    GROUP BY case_id
)
, case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity_sequence
    FROM activity_sequence
)
, variant_counts AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity_sequence, COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
)
, top_variants AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence, count, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
)
, top_k AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence, count, rank
    FROM top_variants
    WHERE rank <= K
)
, final_events AS (
    SELECT * FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_k)
)
SELECT * FROM final_events;

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is efficient or correct. Let me check.

First, ordered_activities adds a row number to each activity in each case, ordered by timestamp. Then, activity_sequence groups by case_id and concatenates the activities in order into a string. Then, case_variants is the same as activity_sequence.

variant_counts groups by the activity_sequence and counts the number of cases per variant.

top_variants ranks these variants by their count, so the highest counts come first.

top_k selects the top K variants.

Then, final_events selects all events from cases that are in any of the top K variants.

But I think this might not work because the RANK() function in SQL might not behave as expected when there are ties. Also, the way I'm selecting case_id from top_k might not be correct.

Wait, actually, the top_k would have all the variants that are in the top K, and their counts. Then, I need to select all cases that belong to any of these variants. So, the final_events would include all events from cases that are in the top_k's case_ids.

But how do I get the case_ids from top_k? Because top_k has activity_sequence and count and rank. I need to get the case_ids that correspond to these activity_sequences.

Wait, no. Actually, the top_k is based on the count of cases per variant. Each variant is an activity_sequence, and the count is how many cases have that sequence. So, to get the case_ids, I need to select from variant_counts where rank <= K, but that would still give me the activity_sequence and the count.

But I need the actual case_ids that have those sequences. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps after getting the top K variants, I can select all cases that have any of those sequences. But in SQL, how do I get the case_ids for those sequences?

Wait, maybe the approach is flawed. Because the variant_counts have the activity_sequence as a string, and the count. So, the top_variants would have the activity_sequence and the count, ranked. Then, top_k would be the top K rows of that.

But how do I get the case_ids that have those sequences? Because each variant is a string, and each case can have only one variant.

Wait, no. Each case has only one variant, which is its activity_sequence. So, the variant_counts already have the count per variant, and the top_k is the top K variants (i.e., the top K activity_sequences) based on their count.

So, to get all cases that are in the top K variants, I can select all cases where their activity_sequence is in the top_k's activity_sequences.

But how do I do that? Because the top_k is a subset of the activity_sequences ordered by count.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. For each case, get its activity_sequence.

2. Group by activity_sequence and count the number of cases per sequence.

3. Order these groups by count in descending order.

4. Take the top K groups.

5. Then, select all events where the case's activity_sequence is in the top K groups.

So, the final query should return all events from cases whose activity_sequence is among the top K variants.

Therefore, in SQL terms:

- First, compute the activity_sequence for each case.

- Then, group by activity_sequence and count.

- Order by count descending.

- Select top K.

- Then, select all events where activity_sequence is in the top K.

So, the SQL query would involve:

WITH activity_sequence AS (
    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, ',') AS sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
, variant_counts AS (
    SELECT sequence, COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM activity_sequence
    GROUP BY sequence
)
, top_variants AS (
    SELECT sequence, count, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
)
, top_k AS (
    SELECT sequence, count, rank
    FROM top_variants
    WHERE rank <= K
)
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE sequence IN (SELECT sequence FROM top_k);

Wait, but does this work? Because RANK() might not give unique ordering if there are ties in counts. For example, if two variants have the same count, the RANK() would be the same, so the higher ranked one might not be correctly selected.

Alternatively, using DENSE_RANK() to handle ties, but the problem is, if K is 5, and the top 5 have the same count, we need to select all of them.

But perhaps the main issue is that the activity_sequence is a string, and in SQL, I can group by it, count, and then order.

But maybe the way to get the top K is to use a window function or a subquery.

Another approach is to compute the frequency of each sequence, then get the top K sequences based on frequency, and then select all cases that have those sequences.

So, the SQL would involve:

WITH activity_sequence AS (
    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, ',') AS sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
, variant_counts AS (
    SELECT sequence, COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM activity_sequence
    GROUP BY sequence
)
, top_variants AS (
    SELECT sequence, count
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE sequence IN (SELECT sequence FROM top_variants);

Wait, but the LIMIT K would give the top K sequences, but what if multiple sequences have the same count? Using LIMIT without an ORDER BY could be problematic, but in this case, we are ordering by count descending, so it should be okay.

But another issue is that the activity_sequence is built as a string, and in SQL, the string can be long and may not be indexable, which could affect performance.

But for the purpose of this problem, assuming that K is manageable, this should work.

Putting it all together, the SQL query would:

1. For each case_id, group the activities into a sequence string.

2. Group these sequences and count how many cases have each sequence.

3. Get the top K sequences based on their count.

4. Select all events where the case's sequence is in the top K.

So, the complete SQL query would be:

WITH activity_sequence AS (
    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, ',') AS sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
, variant_counts AS (
    SELECT sequence, COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM activity_sequence
    GROUP BY sequence
)
, top_variants AS (
    SELECT sequence, count
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE sequence IN (SELECT sequence FROM top_variants);

But wait, in the WITH clauses, the aliases might conflict. So, I need to make sure the column names are unique.

Alternatively, using different aliases.

But perhaps the answer should just outline the steps without the exact aliases, but the structure is as above.

So, to summarize, the SQL query will:

- Use a CTE to group each case_id's activities into a sequence string.

- Another CTE to count how many cases each sequence has.

- Another CTE to get the top K sequences based on their count.

- Finally, select all events where the case_id's sequence is in the top K.

I think that's the approach. Now, I should write the SQL query accordingly, making sure to use the correct syntax for grouping and ordering.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to construct a SQL query that identifies unique process variants from an event log, counts their occurrences, and selects the top K frequent variants. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Group Activities by Case**: For each case (identified by `case_id`), create a sequence of activities ordered by their timestamps. This sequence can be represented as a string using `STRING_AGG(activity, ',')`.

2. **Count Variants**: Group these sequences and count how many cases correspond to each unique sequence.

3. **Identify Top K Variants**: Determine the top K sequences based on their frequency (count) by ordering them in descending order of their counts and selecting the top K.

4. **Filter Events**: Select all events from cases whose activity sequences are among the top K sequences.

Here is the SQL query implementing these steps:

```sql
WITH activity_sequence AS (
    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, ',') AS sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
, variant_counts AS (
    SELECT sequence, COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM activity_sequence
    GROUP BY sequence
)
, top_variants AS (
    SELECT sequence, count
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE sequence IN (SELECT sequence FROM top_variants);
```

**Explanation**:

- **activity_sequence**: This CTE (Common Table Expression) groups activities by `case_id` and concatenates them into a string representation of the activity sequence.
  
- **variant_counts**: This CTE counts how many cases correspond to each unique activity sequence.

- **top_variants**: This CTE identifies the top K sequences by their frequency, ordering them from highest to lowest count and limiting the result to K rows.

- **Final Selection**: The main query selects all events from the original table where the activity sequence of the case is among the top K sequences identified.

This query efficiently groups, counts, and retrieves the required information, ensuring that only the most frequent process variants are included in the final result.
