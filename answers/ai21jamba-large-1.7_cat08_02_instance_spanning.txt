### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

#### Identifying and Quantifying Constraints

I would analyze the event log to detect and quantify the impact of the constraints as follows:

- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations**:
	- Identify all orders requiring cold packing.
	- Measure **waiting time at the cold-packing station** (difference between "Activity Completed: Packing" and "Activity Started: Cold Packing").
	- Compare this against the non-cold-packing orders to isolate impact.
	- Metrics: Average wait time per cold-pack order, % of total fulfillment time spent waiting.
	- **Differentiation**: Separate waiting time (due to station availability) from activity time (cold packing itself).
- **Shipping Batches**:
	- Identify orders waiting for batching at "Shipping Label Generation."
	- Measure **batch formation time** (difference between "Packing Complete" and "Shipping Label Generation" start).
	- Metrics: Average batching delay, % of time orders wait for batch formation.
	- **Differentiation**: Compare batching delay to overall waiting time for "Shipping Label Generation."
- **Priority Handling**:
	- Track "Express Order" flags.
	- Measure the number of times express orders preempt standard orders.
	- Metrics: Paused order time, delay impact on standard orders.
	- **Differentiation**: Attribute delays to express orders specifically by tracking preemption events.
- **Hazardous Material Limits**:
	- Count orders flagged as "Hazardous" processed per timestamp.
	- Measure waiting times for "Packing" and "Quality Check" due to regulatory constraints.
	- Metrics: Time delayed due to hazard cap, instances where orders exceed the 10-concurrent-order limit.
	- **Differentiation**: Separate delay caused by reaching the cap versus delays inherent to normal flow.

#### Differentiating Waiting Times

- **Within-Instance Factors**: Activity duration (e.g., time spent picking items) unrelated to external orders.
- **Between-Instance Factors**: Queuing caused by constraints (e.g., cold-packing station availability).

#### Metrics:

- **Within-Instance**: Activity duration.
- **Between-Instance**: Queue wait time and preemption time.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

#### Interactions Between Constraints

1. **Express Orders Needing Cold Packing**:
	- Express orders preempt standard orders, but if the cold-packing station is occupied by another express order, delays occur. This compounds resource contention for cold-packing.
	- **Impact Metric**: Increased waiting time for express+cold-pack orders.
2. **Batching Hazardous Orders**:
	- If multiple hazardous orders are batched for a single region, processing may be delayed to comply with the hazardous limit.
	- **Impact Metric**: Increased cycle time for hazardous orders.

#### Importance of Understanding Interactions

- Interactions amplify inefficiencies: For example, hazardous limits might cap how quickly orders can batch, indirectly reducing throughput for cold-packed goods.
- Optimization strategies must account for **trade-offs**; e.g., decremental batching for hazardous goods could reduce batching delays but conflicts with regulatory limits.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold Packing**
	- **Constraint Addressed**: Limited Cold-Packing stations.
	- **Proposed Change**: Use real-time data to allocate "Cold-Packing" resources dynamically, prioritizing express and hazardous orders.
	- **How It Leverages Data**: Predicts hourly cold-pack demand using historical event logs.
	- **Expected Outcome**: Reduced waiting time and improved resource utilization.
2. **Dynamic Batch Formation Triggers**
	- **Constraint Addressed**: Shipping Batch delays.
	- **Proposed Change**: Introduce dynamic batching logic:
		- Trigger batching based on a threshold time (e.g., form a batch every 15 minutes).
		- Allow small batches when demand is low.
	- **How It Leverages Data**: Real-time tracking of orders by region and waiting times.
	- **Expected Outcome**: Reduced batching delays without significant increases in delivery route complexity.
3. **Constraint-Aware Prioritization Logic for Order Sequencing**
	- **Constraint Addressed**: Priority Handling, Hazardous Material Limits.
	- **Proposed Change**: Develop a heuristic scheduler:
		- Incorporates priority levels (e.g., express, hazardous) alongside hazard limits.
		- Reserves capacity proactively for "Hazardous" orders to avoid capacity breaches.
		- Dynamically adjusts order prioritization to reduce express order delays without penalizing standard orders.
	- **How It Leverages Data**: Analyzes historical data to estimate probabilities of different process events (e.g., likelihood of hazardous orders arriving in a batch).
	- **Expected Outcome**: Improved compliance with hazard limits while prioritizing high-value orders.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

#### Using Simulations

1. **Simulation Design**:
	- Incorporate instance-spanning constraints (cold-packing limits, batching, priority handling, hazardous material caps).
	- Model **queue formations** at resource bottlenecks.
2. **Validate Strategies**:
	- **Cold-Packing**: Test dynamic allocation and measure reductions in waiting times for express vs. standard orders.
	- **Batching**: Evaluate trade-offs between dynamic triggers and delivery route efficiency.
	- **Hazardous Limits**: Test reservation-based prioritization to observe impacts on compliance and flow.
3. **Capturing Dynamics**:
	- Model **interaction effects**: For example, how express orders interact with hazardous orders needing cold packing.
4. **KPIs**:
	- End-to-End fulfillment time.
	- Waiting time for constrained resources.
	- Throughput under peak conditions.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

#### Key Metrics for Monitoring

- **Shared Resources**: Queue lengths and waiting times at Cold-Packing stations and Quality Check for hazardous materials.
- **Batching**: % of orders delayed by batching, % of orders in small batches.
- **Priority Handling**: Average delay for standard orders due to express order preemption.
- **Hazardous Compliance**: Number of hazardous orders processed simultaneously and time spent near the cap.

#### Dashboards

1. **Heatmaps** of resource utilization at Cold-Packing stations and Safety Caps.
2. **Trend Lines** for batching delays and queue wait times.
3. **Priority Handling Metrics**: Time standard orders are paused due to express order preemption.

#### Ensuring Effective Resource Flow

- Set thresholds for actionable insights:
	- If cold-pack station queues exceed 15 minutes, trigger an alert.
	- If hazardous material orders exceed 90% of the cap, alert managers.

By simulating, implementing, and continuously monitoring these strategies, the fulfillment center can address the complexities introduced by instance-spanning constraints effectively.
