### Anomalies and Hypotheses

1. **Out-of-Order Activities**
   - **Anomaly**: In `case_id 1002`, the activity sequence deviates from the expected normal process flow (e.g., `Confirm Shipment` occurs before `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock`).
   - **Hypothesis**: 
     - The logistics department might have attempted to expedite the process due to external pressure (e.g., customer priority requests or SLA commitments).
     - A miscommunication between departments may have caused the sequence to deviate.
     - Automation issues or skipped steps in the process pipeline.

2. **Missing Activities**
   - **Anomaly**: For `case_id 1004`, critical steps like `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock` are missing, and `Receive Payment` happens before `Issue Invoice`.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - Potential system configuration errors or skipped steps in manual workflows.
     - Errors in data entry or logging might have resulted in missing records.
     - Policy exception granted to the customer (e.g., pre-approved credit line or upfront payment).

3. **Late or Misaligned Confirmations**
   - **Anomaly**: In `case_id 1003`, the `Confirm Shipment` event happens after `Ship Goods`, violating the expected flow.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - Manual intervention by the logistics team to ship goods without formal confirmation.
     - Delays in updating the system after shipment activities.

4. **Early Payments**
   - **Anomaly**: In `case_id 1004`, `Receive Payment` occurs before `Issue Invoice`, which is contrary to typical processes.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - Customers might have prepaid the order, which is unusual in standard flows.
     - Errors in timestamp logging or incorrect data entry.

5. **Skipped Stock Validation**
   - **Anomaly**: Several cases do not include `Validate Stock` as part of the process flow (e.g., `case_id 1004`).
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - The order might have been fulfilled directly from available inventory without formal validation due to urgency or stock reliability.

### Investigative SQL Queries

1. **Identify Cases with Out-of-Order Activities**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT case_id
       FROM order_event_log
       GROUP BY case_id
       HAVING ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) != ARRAY[
           'Register Order',
           'Perform Credit Check',
           'Validate Stock',
           'Confirm Shipment',
           'Ship Goods',
           'Issue Invoice',
           'Receive Payment'
       ]
   )
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
   ```

2. **Detect Missing Activities**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activities
   FROM order_event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) < 7;
   ```

3. **Validate Late or Misaligned Confirmations**
   ```sql
   SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp
   FROM order_event_log oel
   JOIN (
       SELECT case_id
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
       INTERSECT
       SELECT case_id
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
       AND timestamp > (
           SELECT timestamp
           FROM order_event_log
           WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
       )
   ) AS anomalies ON oel.case_id = anomalies.case_id;
   ```

4. **Check Early Payments**
   ```sql
   SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp
   FROM order_event_log oel
   JOIN orders o ON oel.case_id = o.case_id
   WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
     AND timestamp < (
         SELECT timestamp
         FROM order_event_log
         WHERE case_id = oel.case_id AND activity = 'Issue Invoice'
     );
   ```

5. **Identify Cases Missing Stock Validation**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity NOT IN ('Validate Stock')
   GROUP BY case_id;
   ```

6. **Analyze Role and Department Trends for Anomalies**
   ```sql
   SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, r.role, r.department
   FROM order_event_log oel
   JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
   WHERE oel.case_id IN (
       -- Subquery to select anomalous case_ids
       SELECT case_id
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Receive Payment')
       GROUP BY case_id
   )
   ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.timestamp;
   ```

7. **Evaluate Timestamp Gaps**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
          LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_timestamp,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp))) AS time_gap_seconds
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT case_id
       FROM order_event_log
       GROUP BY case_id
       HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) < 7
   );
   ```
