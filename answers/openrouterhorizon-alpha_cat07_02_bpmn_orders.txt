This is a BPMN process diagram showing an endtoend order-to-delivery workflow across four lanes: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

Key flow:
- Sales lane starts Monday morning. The order is checked for completeness. A subprocess “Check customer’s order” verifies whether the customer exists; if not, the customer is added to the database, then the process continues.
- Sales sends order details to Production and later drafts the invoice after the product is sent.
- Production receives order details, plans production, and proceeds only if materials are not faulty. It then manufactures the product, producing the “Product complete” event.
- Procurement operates a “Material Compensation Subprocess”: order materials, possibly return material, then check materials. If materials fail, an “Order cancellation” end is available; otherwise, the OK signal feeds Production.
- Warehouse waits for the “Product complete” event, sends the product, and emits the “Product sent” event back to Sales to trigger invoicing.

The diagram uses events, gateways, subprocesses, and message flows to show coordination and exception handling (faulty materials/cancellation).
