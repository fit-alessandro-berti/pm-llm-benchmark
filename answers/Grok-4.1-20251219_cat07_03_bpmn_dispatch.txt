This visualization is a swimlane flowchart (also known as a cross-functional flowchart) that depicts the process of shipping goods in an e-commerce or order fulfillment context. The diagram is divided into three horizontal swimlanes, each representing a different role or department responsible for parts of the process:

1. **Logistics** (top lane)
2. **Completion of goods shop / Order Handling Secretariat** (middle lane)
3. **Warehouse** (bottom lane)

The process flows from left to right, starting with "Ship goods" and ending with "Shipment prepared."

### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Flow:

1. **Start: Ship goods** (middle lane)
   - The process begins when an order needs to be shipped.

2. **Clarify shipment method** (middle lane)
   - The order handling team determines the shipping method.

3. **Decision: Special handling?** (middle lane)
   - If yes → Check if insurance is required.
   - If no → Proceed directly to getting offers from logistic companies.

4. **Check if insurance is required** (middle lane)
   - Decision: Is insurance necessary?
     - Yes → Go to "Insure parcel" (top lane, handled by Logistics).
     - No → Proceed to "Write package label."

5. **Insure parcel** (top lane – Logistics department)
   - If insurance is needed, the Logistics team handles insuring the parcel.
   - After insuring (or if no insurance needed), the flow continues.

6. **Write package label** (middle lane)
   - This step is marked as "always" performed, meaning it's done regardless of the insurance path.

7. **Get 3 offers from logistic companies** (middle lane)
   - The order handling team requests quotes from three different logistics providers.

8. **Select logistic company and place order** (middle lane)
   - Choose the best offer and officially place the shipping order with the selected carrier.

9. **Package goods** (bottom lane – Warehouse)
   - The warehouse team packages the items for shipment.
   - Note: There's a "48 hours" timer icon here, indicating this step must be completed within 48 hours.

10. **Notify customer about delay** (bottom lane – Warehouse)
    - If packaging takes time or there's a delay, the warehouse notifies the customer.

11. **Fill out shipment paperwork** (bottom lane – Warehouse)
    - Complete any required shipping documentation.

12. **Move package to pickup area** (bottom lane – Warehouse)
    - Place the prepared package in the area where the carrier will pick it up.

13. **End: Shipment prepared** (right side)
    - The process completes when the shipment is fully ready for carrier pickup.

### Key Observations:
- Responsibilities are clearly separated: Logistics handles insurance, the order handling/secretariat team manages order details and carrier selection, and the warehouse handles physical preparation.
- There are decision points (diamonds) for special handling and insurance needs.
- A time constraint of 48 hours is explicitly shown for packaging.
- Customer communication occurs if there's a delay in packaging.

This flowchart helps visualize the workflow, identify handoffs between departments, highlight decision points, and ensure time-sensitive steps (like the 48-hour packaging window) are clear.
