Okay, here is the DuckDB SQL query that fulfills the requirements.

**Assumptions:**

*   A DuckDB table named `event_log` exists.
*   The table has at least the columns `case_id` (identifier type), `activity` (text/varchar type), and `timestamp` (timestamp/datetime type).
*   The `timestamp` column accurately reflects the order of events within a case.

**DuckDB SQL Query:**

```sql
WITH EventSequence AS (
    -- Add previous and second previous activity/timestamp for sequence checking
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
        LAG(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp,
        LAG(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_prev_activity
    FROM
        event_log
),
CasesToExclude AS (
    -- Identify distinct case_ids that meet BOTH the sequence AND time criteria
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM
        EventSequence
    WHERE
        -- Check for the specific direct sequence
        activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND prev_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND prev_prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        -- Check for the time condition between the 2nd and 3rd event in the sequence
        AND (timestamp - prev_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
-- Select all events from the original log...
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
-- ...EXCEPT those belonging to the cases identified for exclusion
WHERE
    el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesToExclude);

-- Alternative using LEFT JOIN (potentially more performant on large datasets)
/*
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
LEFT JOIN
    CasesToExclude cte ON el.case_id = cte.case_id
WHERE
    cte.case_id IS NULL; -- Keep only events where the case_id did not match any in CasesToExclude
*/

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`EventSequence` CTE:**
    *   Uses the `LAG` window function partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp`.
    *   `LAG(activity, 1)` gets the immediately preceding activity within the same case.
    *   `LAG(timestamp, 1)` gets the timestamp of the immediately preceding activity.
    *   `LAG(activity, 2)` gets the activity two steps prior within the same case.
    *   This structure allows us to examine three consecutive events in each row where the current `activity` is the third event in a potential sequence.

2.  **`CasesToExclude` CTE:**
    *   Filters the `EventSequence` CTE to find rows representing the *end* of the target sequence ('Confirm Order').
    *   It checks if the current `activity` is 'Confirm Order', the `prev_activity` is 'Create Order', and the `prev_prev_activity` is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. This confirms the direct sequence.
    *   It then checks the time condition: `(timestamp - prev_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'`. This calculates the difference between the 'Confirm Order' event (`timestamp`) and the 'Create Order' event (`prev_timestamp`).
    *   `SELECT DISTINCT case_id` gathers all unique `case_id`s where this combined condition (sequence + time) is met at least once within the case.

3.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   Selects all columns (`el.*`) from the original `event_log` table (aliased as `el`).
    *   The `WHERE el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesToExclude)` clause filters the results, keeping only those events whose `case_id` is *not* present in the `CasesToExclude` list.
    *   Alternatively, the commented-out `LEFT JOIN / WHERE IS NULL` achieves the same result (an anti-join pattern).

This query effectively identifies cases meeting the specific sequence and timing criteria and then excludes all events associated with those cases from the final output.
