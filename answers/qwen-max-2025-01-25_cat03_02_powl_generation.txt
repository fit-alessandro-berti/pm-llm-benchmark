Below is the Python code that constructs the POWL model for the described telecom company's digital service provisioning process. The code uses the `pm4py` library and its classes to represent transitions, operators (loops and exclusive choices), and partial orders.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Define all activities as transitions
SR = Transition(label="Service Request (SR)")  # Verify Service Request
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup (CS)")   # Contract Setup
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation (DA)")  # Datacenter Allocation
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization (ACI)")  # Access Control Initialization
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration (BNC)")  # Base Network Configuration
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)")  # Debug & Reconfigure
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment (CD)")  # Containerized Deployment
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment (MD)")  # Monolithic Deployment
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance (QA)")  # Quality Assurance
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit (SA)")  # Security Audit
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval (GLA)")  # Go-Live Approval

# Step 2: Define the loop for Base Network Configuration and Debug & Reconfigure
loop_BNC_DR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Step 3: Define the exclusive choice for deployment methods
xor_CD_MD = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 4: Define the partial order for QA and SA
partial_order_QA_SA = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
partial_order_QA_SA.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)  # QA must complete before GLA
partial_order_QA_SA.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)  # SA must complete before GLA

# Step 5: Define the overall partial order for the entire process
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop_BNC_DR, xor_CD_MD, partial_order_QA_SA, GLA])

# Add edges to define the execution order
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # SR must be completed before CS
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)  # CS must be completed before DA
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)  # CS must be completed before ACI
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop_BNC_DR)  # DA must be completed before the loop
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_BNC_DR)  # ACI must be completed before the loop
root.order.add_edge(loop_BNC_DR, xor_CD_MD)  # Loop must complete before deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(xor_CD_MD, partial_order_QA_SA)  # Deployment must complete before QA/SA

# Final output of the POWL model
print("POWL Model Constructed Successfully!")
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Transitions**:
   - Each activity in the process is represented as a `Transition` object with an appropriate label.
   - For example, `SR` represents the "Service Request" verification step.

2. **Loop Node**:
   - The loop between `BNC` (Base Network Configuration) and `DR` (Debug & Reconfigure) is modeled using the `OperatorPOWL` class with the `Operator.LOOP` operator.
   - This ensures that `BNC` is executed first, followed by optional `DR`, and the loop repeats until stability is achieved.

3. **Exclusive Choice**:
   - The choice between `CD` (Containerized Deployment) and `MD` (Monolithic Deployment) is modeled using the `OperatorPOWL` class with the `Operator.XOR` operator.
   - Only one of these two activities will be executed based on the chosen deployment method.

4. **Partial Orders**:
   - The tasks `QA` (Quality Assurance) and `SA` (Security Audit) are partially ordered using the `StrictPartialOrder` class.
   - Both `QA` and `SA` must complete before `GLA` (Go-Live Approval), but they can be executed concurrently or in any order.

5. **Overall Partial Order**:
   - The entire process is encapsulated in a `StrictPartialOrder` object (`root`).
   - Edges are added to enforce the dependencies between activities, ensuring the correct execution flow.

### Key Dependencies:
- `pm4py`: This library provides the necessary classes and utilities to construct and manipulate POWL models.
- `Operator.LOOP` and `Operator.XOR`: These operators are used to define loops and exclusive choices, respectively.

---

### Output:
When this code is executed, it constructs the POWL model for the described scenario. The `print` statement confirms successful construction of the model. This model can then be used for further analysis, simulation, or visualization using `pm4py`.
