## Analysis of Process Execution vs. Normative Rules and Desiderata

### 1. Normative Rule Violations

**Case 2 bears multiple severe normative violations:**

- **Violation 1:** Risk Assessment occurred **BEFORE** Credit Check
  - By strict rules, "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment." In Case 2, Risk Assessment happened at 08:20 while Credit Check only occurred later at 09:00. This reverses the required sequence.

- **Violation 2:** Finalize Documentation occurred after **Rejection**
  - The normative constraints clearly state that documentation should not be finalized if the loan is rejected. In Case 2, after Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30, Finalize Documentation incorrectly occurred at 10:00.

**Case 1 and Case 3 have no normative rule violations.**

### 2. Desiderata (Recommended Practice) Failures

**Case 3 fails on all desiderata:**

- **Timing Recommendation 1:** Credit Check delay
  - The desideratum recommends completing Credit Check within 24 hours after application receipt. In Case 3, Credit Check occurred at 2024-01-14 10:00, which is approximately 49 hours after application receipt at 2024-01-12 09:00.

- **Timing Recommendation 2:** Inform Applicant delay
  - Ideally, the applicant should be informed within 48 hours of the loan decision. Here, the decision was made at 2024-01-14 12:00, but the applicant was only informed at 2024-01-16 15:00 - approximately 51 hours later.

- **Optional Practice:** Missing Follow-up Call
  - No Follow-up Call entry appeared in Case 3 (though confirmatory verification would be ideal to ensure it wasn't missed during logging).

**Case 2** also appears to lack a Follow-up Call, but given the severe normative violations present, the desiderata analysis becomes secondary.

**Case 1** appears compliant with all desiderata - speed of Credit Check (30 minutes), prompt notification (2 hours), and while no Follow-up Call is explicitly visible, this may have occurred or been omitted as permitted.

### 3. Possible Interpretations and Justifications

For **Case 2's violations**, one might consider:

- **System Error / Recording Issue:** An administrative mistake might have caused Risk Assessment to be recorded before Credit Check - potentially the actual chronological sequence was correct, just poorly logged.

- **Parallel Processing Gone Wrong:** Staff might have attempted parallel processing to accelerate the workflow, mistakenly initiating Risk Assessment while Credit Check was queued or in progress. While this could explain the timing, it doesn't justify the documentation finalization after rejection.

- **Manual Override Error:** A staff member might have accidentally selected "approved" during Finalize Documentation, forgetting the loan was rejected, suggesting a need for better UI controls.

For **Case 3's desiderata failures**:

- **Weekend Delay:** The 2-day delay in Credit Check might reflect the application arriving just before or over a weekend (Saturday application), with normal business processing resuming on Monday.

- **Information Collection:** The delay in Credit Check and subsequent notification might indicate the need to gather additional documentation from the applicant or third-party verification sources.

- **Volume Spike:** High application volume might have overwhelmed standard processing times.

- **Resource Constraints:** Temporary staff shortages or system maintenance could explain delays without representing chronic issues.
