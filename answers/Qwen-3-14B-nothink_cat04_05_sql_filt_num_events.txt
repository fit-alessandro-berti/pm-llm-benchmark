Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task as described:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
INNER JOIN
    case_event_counts cec
ON
    el.case_id = cec.case_id
WHERE
    cec.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation:

- **`case_event_counts` CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the number of events per `case_id`.
- **`INNER JOIN`**: Joins the original `event_log` with the counts, so we can filter based on the count.
- **`WHERE cec.event_count <= 6`**: Ensures we only include events from cases with six or fewer events.

This query returns all events from cases that have six or fewer events in total.
