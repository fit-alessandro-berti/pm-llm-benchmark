Hereâ€™s the DuckDB SQL query to achieve the desired filtering:  

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_event_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Count Events per Case**:  
   The **`case_event_counts`** CTE counts the number of events per `case_id` and filters out cases where the count exceeds six (`HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`).

2. **Filter Events Based on Case Counts**:  
   The main query selects all event rows (`e.*`) from `event_log`, but only for `case_id`s that exist in `case_event_counts`, ensuring only cases with six or fewer events are included.

This ensures that all events belonging to cases exceeding six events are completely excluded from the result. ðŸš€
