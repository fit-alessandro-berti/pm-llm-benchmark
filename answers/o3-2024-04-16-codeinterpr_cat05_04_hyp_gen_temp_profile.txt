Anomalies detected in the temporal profile model
-------------------------------------------------
1. R  P (Receive  Approve)  
   • Average  25 h but STDEV only 1 h – timing is strangely uniform, suggesting an artificial schedule or automated batch job.

2. P  N (Approve  Notify)  
   • Average 7 days, STDEV 2 days – very long and highly variable delay; indicates backlog, manual follow-up, or resource shortages.

3. A  C (Assign  Close)  
   • Average just 2 h – implies many claims are closed almost immediately after assignment, possibly bypassing Evaluate/Approve.

4. E  N (Evaluate  Notify)  
   • Average 5 min, STDEV 1 min – transition is almost instantaneous; may point to automated notifications or skipped approval checks.

5. R  E vs. R  P  
   • R  E takes ~24 h but R  P only 25 h, leaving almost no time between Evaluate and Approve for review or negotiation.

Hypotheses explaining the anomalies
-----------------------------------
H-1  Automated batch approvals are executed once per day, creating a tight cluster around 24–26 h after receipt (explains low STDEV in R  P).

H-2  Manual backlog on customer communications forces notifications to be sent days after approval, with timing varying by workload (explains long, erratic P  N).

H-3  Certain low-value or low-risk claims are fast-tracked: they are assigned and then closed without evaluation (explains short A  C).

H-4  An integration with an external rules engine automatically fires the notification immediately after evaluation, skipping the human approval step for specific claim types (explains very short E  N).

H-5  Specific adjusters or regions have different work patterns, creating the above timing oddities (e.g., one region closes claims quickly, another delays notifications).

Verification approach (illustrative SQL queries)
------------------------------------------------

1. Claims with unusually tight R  P interval (< 28 h or > 2 × STDEV):
```sql
WITH rp AS (
  SELECT
      c.claim_id,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS t_r,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS t_p
  FROM claim_events c
  GROUP BY c.claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_p - t_r))/3600 AS hours_r_to_p
FROM rp
WHERE t_r IS NOT NULL
  AND t_p IS NOT NULL
  AND (t_p - t_r) < INTERVAL '22 hours'      -- below avg-10%
   OR (t_p - t_r) > INTERVAL '28 hours';     -- above avg+10%
```

2. Long P  N delays (> 5 days):
```sql
WITH pn AS (
  SELECT
      c.claim_id,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS t_p,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS t_n
  FROM claim_events c
  GROUP BY c.claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       t_p,
       t_n,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_n - t_p))/86400 AS days_p_to_n
FROM pn
WHERE t_p IS NOT NULL
  AND t_n IS NOT NULL
  AND (t_n - t_p) > INTERVAL '5 days'
ORDER BY days_p_to_n DESC;
```

3. Claims closed within 3 h of assignment (possible fast-track):
```sql
WITH ac AS (
  SELECT
      claim_id,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS t_a,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS t_c
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT cl.claim_id,
       cl.claim_type,
       ac.t_a,
       ac.t_c,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ac.t_c - ac.t_a))/3600 AS hours_a_to_c
FROM ac
JOIN claims cl USING (claim_id)
WHERE ac.t_a IS NOT NULL
  AND ac.t_c IS NOT NULL
  AND (ac.t_c - ac.t_a) <= INTERVAL '3 hours';
```

4. Evaluate without subsequent Approve but immediate Notify (< 15 min):
```sql
WITH en AS (
  SELECT
      claim_id,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS t_e,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS t_n,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS t_p
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       t_e,
       t_n,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_n - t_e))/60 AS minutes_e_to_n
FROM en
WHERE t_e IS NOT NULL
  AND t_n IS NOT NULL
  AND t_p IS NULL                    -- no Approve recorded
  AND (t_n - t_e) <= INTERVAL '15 minutes';
```

5. Correlate anomalies with adjusters and regions:
```sql
-- Example: average PN delay per adjuster
WITH pn AS (
  SELECT
      ce.claim_id,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS t_p,
      MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS t_n
  FROM claim_events ce
  GROUP BY ce.claim_id
), mapped AS (
  SELECT
      pn.*,
      (SELECT resource
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE claim_id = pn.claim_id
         AND activity = 'A'
       ORDER BY timestamp
       LIMIT 1) AS assigned_adjuster
)
SELECT assigned_adjuster,
       COUNT(*) AS claims_handled,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_n - t_p))/86400) AS avg_days_p_to_n
FROM mapped
WHERE t_p IS NOT NULL
  AND t_n IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY assigned_adjuster
ORDER BY avg_days_p_to_n DESC;
```

Use findings from the queries to confirm or refute the hypotheses, inspect specific claims, and determine whether certain claim types, adjusters, or regions disproportionately contribute to the timing irregularities.
