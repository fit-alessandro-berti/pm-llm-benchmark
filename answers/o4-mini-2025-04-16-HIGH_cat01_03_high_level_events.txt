Here is a proposal of five high-level process steps, each grouping a coherent set of low-level events. For clarity, I show how the same grouping applies to both sample cases (A1 and B2).

1. Material Preparation  
   • Constituent low-level activities  
     – Retrieve raw metal sheet  
     – Scan barcode  
     – Place metal sheet on table  
     – Align metal sheet  
     – Preheat metal sheet  
   • Case A1 timestamps: 08:00:05  08:00:20  
     Case B2 timestamps: 08:00:05  08:00:25  
   • Rationale  
     – All five events occur at the very start, preparing the sheet for downstream work.  
     – They involve the same logical goal (getting the blank into position and up to temperature).  
     – Resources span Operator A, Robot Arm #2 and Heating Unit #1—together they form the “prep” sub-process.

2. Welding Assembly  
   • Constituent low-level activities  
     – Pick up welding tool  
     – Weld corner A  
     – Weld corner B  
   • Case A1 timestamps: 08:01:00  08:01:10  
     Case B2 timestamps: 08:01:03  08:01:12  
   • Rationale  
     – These three events are temporally contiguous and all involve creating the permanent joins.  
     – Picking up the tool and the two spot-welds naturally form the “assembly” core.

3. In-Process Inspection  
   • Constituent low-level activity  
     – Measure weld integrity  
   • Case A1 timestamp: 08:01:20  
     Case B2 timestamp: 08:01:22  
   • Rationale  
     – Immediately follows welding, by a dedicated Quality Sensor.  
     – It guards against downstream rework by catching defects right after the weld step.

4. Coating Process  
   • Constituent low-level activities  
     – Apply protective coating  
     – Dry coating  
   • Case A1 timestamps: 08:01:30  08:01:45  
     Case B2 timestamps: 08:01:35  08:01:50  
   • Rationale  
     – These two steps both use coating/heating units to apply and cure the finish.  
     – They form a natural “surface treatment” or “finishing” sub-process.

5. Final Inspection  
   • Constituent low-level activity  
     – Visual check  
   • Case A1 timestamp: 08:02:00  
     Case B2 timestamp: 08:02:05  
   • Rationale  
     – Marks the end of the flow, a human-performed pass/fail check on the completed part.  
     – It aggregates all final quality validation into one high-level “inspection” step.

Structured Summary (for both A1 & B2):  
• Step 1: Material Preparation  
  – Events [Retrieve raw metal sheet  Preheat metal sheet]  
• Step 2: Welding Assembly  
  – Events [Pick up welding tool  Weld corner A/B]  
• Step 3: In-Process Inspection  
  – Event [Measure weld integrity]  
• Step 4: Coating Process  
  – Events [Apply protective coating  Dry coating]  
• Step 5: Final Inspection  
  – Event [Visual check]

With these five high-level activities, the manufacturing workflow becomes much clearer: you see a “prep  assemble  inspect in-process  finish surface  final QA” sequence instead of a long list of atomized events.
