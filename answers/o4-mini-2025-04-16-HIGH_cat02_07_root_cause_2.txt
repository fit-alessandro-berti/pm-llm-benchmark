1. Cases with long cycle times  
   - Case 2002 (Medium complexity, Region B): 2024-04-01 09:05  2024-04-02 11:00  25 h 55 m  
   - Case 2003 (High complexity, Region A): 2024-04-01 09:10  2024-04-03 09:30  48 h 20 m  
   - Case 2005 (High complexity, Region B): 2024-04-01 09:25  2024-04-04 14:30  77 h 05 m  
   (By contrast, the two Low-complexity cases close within 1 – 1.5 hours; high-complexity cases are 2–3 days, medium roughly 1 day.)

2. Key correlations / root-cause hypotheses  
   • Complexity level  
     – Medium and high-complexity claims trigger one or more “Request Additional Documents” loops.  
     – Each extra document round introduces a 20–24 hour waiting period (pending customer response).  
     – More complexity  more doc-request iterations  longer lead time.  
   • Resource bottlenecks  
     – Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) consistently issues doc requests that aren’t closed out until the next day (~20 h lag).  
     – Adjuster_Mike (Region A) issues two same-day doc requests in Case 2003, but the approval then waits until 16:00 next day (Manager_Bill’s queue).  
     – Manager_Bill (used for high-complexity approvals) averages ~24 h to approve, versus <1 h for Manager_Ann (handles Low/Medium).  
   • Regional differences  
     – Region B (cases 2002, 2004, 2005) shows medium/high claims taking longer than their Region A counterparts, likely reflecting resource coverage or process discipline gaps in B.

3. Explanations & mitigation suggestions  
   A. Automate / accelerate document-collection  
     – Provide claimants with an online portal checklist and automated reminders to return docs within X hours.  
     – Pre-validate common document types at upload to cut down back-and-forth.  
   B. Balance resource workloads  
     – Reassign or hire a second high-complexity adjuster in Region B to share Adjuster_Lisa’s load and reduce queue times.  
     – Cross-train Adjuster_Mike (Region A) or shift some high-complexity work to him to even out turnaround.  
   C. Streamline approvals  
     – Empower Manager_Ann or another fastresponding manager to sign off on a portion of high-complexity claims, or introduce SLAs for Manager_Bill (e.g., 4 h).  
     – Implement an escalation rule: if approval pending > 8 h, reroute to a backup approver.  
   D. Monitor & enforce SLAs by complexity/region  
     – Define target leadtimes (e.g., Medium  24 h, High  48 h) and track per resource and region.  
     – Introduce dashboards and alerts for cases trending past thresholds.  

By reducing the number of manual document cycles (via automation), evening out adjuster workloads between regions, and tightening approval SLAs, you can sharply cut the end-to-end durations for medium and high-complexity claims.
