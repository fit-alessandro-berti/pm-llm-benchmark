**Labeled Activities and Explanations**

Below is the inferred segmentation of the events into distinct phases, along with suggested activity labels and justifications based on the observed sensor patterns.

**1. Idle / Setup Phases (Events #1–3 and #13–15)**  
- **Events:** #1, #2, #3, #13, #14, #15  
- **Observations:**  
  - Temperature: ~20–21°C (room/ambient level)  
  - Pressure: 1 bar (minimal, baseline)  
  - Vibration: 0 Hz (no active machine movement)  
  - Material Flow: 0 units/s (no processing of material)  
  - Tool Position: 0 mm (tool not engaged)  
  - Energy: Low (0.40–0.50 kWh), indicating a standby or very low power mode  
- **Interpretation:**  
  These events likely represent the machine’s starting and ending conditions, where it is essentially idle, not processing materials, and not engaged in active operations. It could be an initial calibration or a cooldown period after the process is complete.

**2. Cutting / Machining Operation (Events #4–6)**  
- **Events:** #4, #5, #6  
- **Observations:**  
  - Temperature: Rises sharply from 21°C to 58°C  
  - Pressure: Slight increase to around 1.5 bar  
  - Vibration: High (30–38 Hz), indicating active tool engagement with material  
  - Material Flow: Steady at 5 units/s, suggesting continuous feed of raw material  
  - Tool Position: Moves from 5 mm to 10 mm, indicating the tool is advancing into the workpiece  
  - Energy: Significant increase (2.00–3.00 kWh), reflecting heavier load and tool operation  
- **Interpretation:**  
  The increase in temperature, high vibration, and steady material flow suggest a metalworking process (e.g., cutting, drilling, or milling). The rising tool position and higher energy use support the idea that the machine is actively shaping or cutting the material.

**3. Assembling Parts (Events #7–8)**  
- **Events:** #7, #8  
- **Observations:**  
  - Temperature: Drops to about 40°C (lower than during cutting but still elevated)  
  - Pressure: Increases to 2 bar  
  - Vibration: Reduced to about 10 Hz (lower than during cutting, but not zero)  
  - Material Flow: Lowered to 2 units/s  
  - Tool Position: Holds at around 15 mm (suggesting the tool or part may be aligned at a certain fixture point)  
  - Energy: Moderate (2.00 kWh, less than cutting but not minimal)  
- **Interpretation:**  
  After a high-intensity cutting phase, the conditions stabilize at intermediate levels. The lower vibration and reduced flow might indicate parts being aligned, fitted, or partially assembled. The machine could be positioning components to prepare them for the next operation.

**4. Welding Operation (Event #9)**  
- **Event:** #9  
- **Observations:**  
  - Temperature: Spikes to 80°C, a strong indicator of a heat-intensive process  
  - Pressure: 2 bar (unchanged from assembling)  
  - Vibration: High at 50 Hz (intense localized activity)  
  - Material Flow: 0 units/s (no new material entering, possibly working on a joint)  
  - Tool Position: Steady at 15 mm (tool might be applying heat to a fixed point)  
  - Energy: Very high at 5.00 kWh, indicating substantial power draw  
- **Interpretation:**  
  The extreme temperature and high energy consumption, coupled with no material flow, align well with a welding process. Welding often requires concentrated energy and heat to join parts.

**5. Quality Inspection (Event #10)**  
- **Event:** #10  
- **Observations:**  
  - Temperature: Drops to 30°C  
  - Pressure: Back to 1 bar  
  - Vibration: Minimal at 1 Hz (near stationary conditions)  
  - Material Flow: 0 units/s  
  - Tool Position: Maintains at 15 mm  
  - Energy: Lower at 1.00 kWh  
- **Interpretation:**  
  Right after welding, the machine likely pauses intense operations. The stable, low-intensity readings suggest an inspection phase—possibly checking weld quality or verifying part alignment. Little to no material movement and low vibration indicate a non-invasive, observational activity.

**6. Packaging / Final Adjustment (Events #11–12)**  
- **Events:** #11, #12  
- **Observations:**  
  - Temperature: Moderate at 25°C  
  - Pressure: Steady at 1 bar  
  - Vibration: Low (5 Hz), some minor activity  
  - Material Flow: 1 unit/s, indicating a small, steady feed (could be packaging material or minor finishing touches)  
  - Tool Position: 20 mm (slight repositioning from inspection)  
  - Energy: Moderate (1.50–1.60 kWh)  
- **Interpretation:**  
  The subtle activity and small material flow suggest a final step, potentially applying packaging materials or performing final cosmetic work. The machine’s conditions are stable and low-intensity, consistent with a finishing or packaging process.

**Summary of Assigned Labels:**

- **Events #1–3, #13–15:** **Idle/Setup** (Machine inactive, beginning or end of the cycle)  
- **Events #4–6:** **Cutting/Machining** (High vibration, rising temperature, steady material flow)  
- **Events #7–8:** **Assembling Parts** (Reduced vibration, moderate conditions, parts likely being fitted)  
- **Event #9:** **Welding** (High temperature and energy, no material flow)  
- **Event #10:** **Quality Inspection** (Low vibration, no flow, stable position, post-weld check)  
- **Events #11–12:** **Packaging/Final Adjustment** (Low-level activity, small material flow, likely final finishing step)

These inferred labels are based on the observed changes in temperature, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption, which collectively suggest transitions between different manufacturing activities.
