Based on the attributes provided, the following attributes can be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the patient is a citizen or not, which can lead to biases and disparities in treatment based on nationality or immigration status.
2. **case:german speaking**: Similar to the previous attribute, this one indicates whether the patient speaks German or not. Language proficiency can be a barrier to accessing healthcare services, and biases may exist against patients who do not speak the dominant language.
3. **case:private_insurance**: This attribute indicates whether the patient has private insurance or not. Patients with private insurance may have better access to healthcare services or shorter waiting times, leading to biases against those without private insurance.
4. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the patient's gender, which can be a sensitive attribute in the context of healthcare. Biases may exist against certain genders in terms of diagnosis, treatment, or quality of care.

The other attributes, such as **case:underlying_condition**, **resource**, **start_timestamp**, **time**, and **time:timestamp**, are less likely to be sensitive for fairness as they do not directly relate to personal characteristics or demographic information.

It is essential to consider these sensitive attributes when analyzing or modeling the event log data to avoid perpetuating biases or disparities in the healthcare process.
