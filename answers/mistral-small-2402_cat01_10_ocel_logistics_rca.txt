Based on the provided directly follows graph, here are some potential process and data-specific root causes for performance issues:

1. Long duration between "pick item" and "create package" (179085.13): This could indicate inefficiencies in the picking process or delays in creating packages.

2. High frequency of "pick item" -> "pick item" events for employees (4545): This could suggest that employees are frequently picking up the same item, which might be due to poor inventory management or inefficient picking routines.

3. High frequency of "item out of stock" -> "reorder item" (1078) and "confirm order" -> "item out of stock" (895): These could indicate frequent stockouts, which might be due to inaccurate demand forecasting or slow reordering processes.

4. Long duration between "confirm order" and "pay order" (528039.95) for orders: This could suggest delays in payment processing or issues with the payment system.

5. High frequency of "package delivered" -> "payment reminder" (859): This could indicate that customers are frequently late with their payments, which might be due to unclear payment terms or ineffective payment reminders.

6. High frequency of events with the same activity for employees and products (e.g., "pick item" -> "pick item"): These could suggest redundant or unnecessary steps in the process.

7. Long durations between various activities for products (e.g., "pick item" -> "package delivered" has a duration of 7340.10): These could indicate bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the process flow.
