### Analysis and Renaming of Activities

After reviewing the event log, I identified the following activities that appear multiple times within the same case and require renaming to reflect their contextual differences:

1. **Verify Documents**
   - Appears multiple times in cases where documents are initially verified, then re-verified after additional information is provided or adjustments are made.

2. **Call Customer**
   - Appears in different contexts: to request missing documents, clarify discrepancies, or follow up on adjustments.

3. **Adjust Account**
   - Appears in cases where internal corrections are made, but the context varies (e.g., after a call or due to missing information).

### Justification for Renaming Choices

1. **Verify Documents**
   - **Initial Document Verification**: First occurrence, where documents are checked for the first time.
   - **Re-Verify Documents**: Second occurrence, where documents are rechecked after additional information is provided or adjustments are made.
   - **Physical Document Verification**: Specific to in-person verification at a branch (Case C003).

2. **Call Customer**
   - **Call for Missing Documents**: When the call is made to request missing information (Case C001).
   - **Call for Clarification**: When the call is made to clarify discrepancies (Case C002).
   - **Call for Customer Return**: When the call is made to ask the customer to return to the branch (Case C003).
   - **Follow-Up Call**: When the call is made to confirm adjustments (Case C002).

3. **Adjust Account**
   - **Adjust Account (Post-Call)**: When adjustments are made after a call (Case C002).
   - **Adjust Account (Missing Info)**: When adjustments are made due to missing information (Case C003).

These renames clarify the role of each activity in the process flow and disambiguate their meanings based on context.
