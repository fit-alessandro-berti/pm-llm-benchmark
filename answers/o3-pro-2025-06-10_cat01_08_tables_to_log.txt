Total events: 34  

Notes & Assumptions  
1. Case ID equals `order_id`, as requested.  
2. One “Item Picked” event is logged per order line to preserve the real warehouse activity granularity.  
3. Delivery is represented by two separate events: “Order Dispatched” (start of shipment) and “Order Arrived” (completion of shipment).  
4. Whenever an order is split into multiple shipments or invoices, every record results in its own pair (dispatch/arrival) or single (invoice) event, keeping the life-cycle history complete.  
5. Resource information is enriched from the Resources table; when no clear performer exists (payments), the Resource field is left blank (dash).  
6. Additional columns (invoice amount, payment method, quantity, etc.) are kept in “Additional Attributes”; more columns may be split out if the target process-mining tool prefers wide schemas.  
7. Orders that have not yet progressed to later stages (e.g., order 1004 with no delivery/invoice) simply lack those events; this is valuable for conformance analysis.
