This integrated event log combines data from all tables, using `order_id` as the Case ID and sorting all events chronologically. Resource IDs have been enriched with names and roles where possible.

### Event Log Assumptions Made:
1. **Activity Granularity:** For `Order Lines`, a separate "Item Picked" event is generated for each unique item/picking time combination, providing maximum process detail.
2. **Resource Mapping:** Resources are mapped using the provided `Resources` table (e.g., SP-001 is Alice Brown). For payments, where the responsible party is external or automated, "System/Customer" is used.
3. **Missing Data (Order 1004):** Order 1004 was created and items were picked, but no delivery, invoice, or payment events are recorded. The process is truncated in the log after the picking activity.
