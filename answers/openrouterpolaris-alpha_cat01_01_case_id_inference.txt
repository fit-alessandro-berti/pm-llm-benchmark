Here are the inferred case groupings (case IDs are invented for clarity):

Case A (ER, 45-year-old male, left leg fracture):
- 1. 08:05:13 — Register patient (ER, 45, M, insurance=private)
- 4. 08:10:50 — Initial triage (ER, 45, M, triage_code=3)
- 7. 08:15:42 — X-ray imaging (Radiology, 45, M, body_part=left_leg)
- 12. 08:23:10 — Doctor consultation (ER, 45, M, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
- 15. 08:30:05 — Patient discharged (ER, 45, M, followup=outpatient_clinic)

Case B (ER, 62-year-old female, minor infection with labs):
- 2. 08:07:02 — Register patient (ER, 62, F, insurance=public)
- 5. 08:12:29 — Initial triage (ER, 62, F, triage_code=2)
- 8. 08:16:10 — Lab test requested (ER, 62, F, test_type=blood_panel)
- 10. 08:20:27 — Lab test completed (Laboratory, 62, F, results=normal_levels)
- 11. 08:22:54 — Doctor consultation (ER, 62, F, diagnosis=minor_infection)
- 14. 08:27:00 — Prescription created (ER, 62, F, medication=antibiotics)
- 17. 08:35:29 — Patient discharged (ER, 62, F, followup=pharmacy_pickup)

Case C (Surgery, 28-year-old male, scheduled knee surgery):
- 3. 08:07:15 — Register patient (Surgery, 28, M, insurance=private)
- 6. 08:13:00 — Doctor consultation (Surgery, 28, M, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)
- 9. 08:16:45 — Surgery preparation (Surgery, 28, M, prep_type=general_anesthesia)
- 13. 08:25:19 — Surgery performed (Surgery, 28, M, procedure=arthroscopy)
- 16. 08:31:37 — Recovery room (Surgery, 28, M, condition=stable)
- 18. 08:40:13 — Patient discharged (Surgery, 28, M, followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

Rationale (brief):
- Each case shows consistent patient_age, patient_gender, and a coherent clinical pathway.
- Timelines are monotonic within each group and medically plausible.
- No conflicting attributes within groups; no overlap that suggests alternative assignments.
