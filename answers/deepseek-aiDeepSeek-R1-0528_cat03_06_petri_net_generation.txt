<think>
We are going to model the insurance claim management process as an accepting Petri net.
 Steps:
 1. Create the Petri net.
 2. Create places for each state and also for the start and end.
 3. Create transitions for each activity: 
      C: Insurance Claim (but note: the customer files the claim, so we might model it as an initial transition? 
          However, the problem says the initial marking is a token in a start place representing a new claim arriving.
          So we don't need a transition for "Insurance Claim" as an activity? The process starts after the claim is filed.
          The activities start with Claim Registration (CR). So we'll have a start place and then CR as the first transition.

 4. The activities we have: 
      CR, DV, FC, CA, AP, P, N, CL, and also RDS and II.

 5. We note that:
      - After CR, we go to DV.
      - After DV, if documents are incomplete, we go to RDS and then back to DV. Otherwise, we go to FC.
      - After FC, if doubts are raised, we go to II and then back to FC. Otherwise, we go to CA.
      - After CA, if the amount surpasses a threshold, we go to AP, then to P. Otherwise, we go directly to P?
          Actually, the problem says: "The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold."
          So we can model: after CA, we have a decision: either go to AP (if above threshold) or skip AP and go to P.
          We can model this with two transitions: one for the case requiring approval and one for the case not requiring.
          However, note that the problem does not specify an activity for skipping approval. We can have:
          - After CA, we have a place, then a transition for AP (if needed) and also a direct transition to P (if not needed).
          Alternatively, we can have a silent transition for skipping approval? But the problem says to label transitions with activity names.

      Let me re-read: "Approval (AP): The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold."
      So AP is only done when necessary. We can model:
          CA -> place -> AP -> place -> P
          and also CA -> place -> (a silent transition? but the problem says to use activity names) ... but skipping approval is not an activity.

      However, note: the problem says "Provide the Python code for constructing the Petri net ... define both the initial marking and final marking".
      We are free to model the control flow.

      We can do:
          After CA, we have a place (say p_after_CA). Then we have two transitions:
            - One labeled "Approval" (AP) that goes to a place (say p_after_AP) and then to P.
            - One labeled "Skip Approval" (but the problem doesn't name that) ... or we can use a silent transition? 
          But the problem says: "transitions labeled with the activity names". The activities are only the ones listed.

      Alternatively, we can have a transition for AP and then a transition that represents the automatic continuation without approval? 
      However, note that the problem does not specify an activity for skipping. 

      Another idea: we can have a silent transition (with label None) for the skip. This is acceptable in Petri nets.

      Similarly, for the loops: we have RDS and II as activities, but the loop back is not an activity? We can use arcs.

 6. We'll model:
      - The initial place: start_place (with token in initial marking)
      - Then transition CR (from start_place to a place after CR)
      - Then DV (from after_CR to after_DV)
      - Then from after_DV, we have two possibilities:
          - If documents are incomplete: RDS (which goes to a place, then back to DV) -> so we need a place between DV and RDS? Actually, we can have:
              after_DV -> RDS -> a place -> and then an arc from that place to DV? But note: DV is the transition we just came from. 
          Alternatively, we can have:
              place_after_DV has an arc to RDS, and RDS goes to a place that is the same as the input place for DV? 
          But note: the input place for DV is the place after CR. We don't want to go back to CR.

      Let me define places:
          p0: start (initial marking: token here)
          p1: after CR (so CR: p0 -> p1)
          p2: after DV (so DV: p1 -> p2) ... but wait, what if we need to go back? Then we need to have an arc from RDS to p1? 
          However, note: after DV, if documents are incomplete, we do RDS and then we go back to DV. So we need to have a place that is the input to DV? 
          But DV requires a token in p1. So we can have:
              DV: p1 -> p2
              Then from p2, we have two transitions:
                 - one silent transition (or labeled?) for "documents complete" -> then go to FC
                 - one transition RDS: p2 -> p3 (a place) and then an arc from p3 back to p1? Then DV can be fired again.

      Similarly for FC and II.

 7. We'll model the loops with places that feed back.

 8. For the approval part:
        After CA, we have a place (say p5). Then:
            - If approval is needed: transition AP from p5 to p6, then P from p6 to p7.
            - If approval is not needed: a silent transition (label None) from p5 to p7.

 9. Then P goes to a place (p8), then N (notification) to p9, then CL (closure) to p_end.

 10. The final marking: token in p_end.

 11. We also note that the process has only one start and one end.

 Steps for construction:

  Places:
    start, end
    p_after_CR
    p_after_DV   (this place will have two outgoing arcs: one to FC and one to RDS)
    p_after_RDS  (and then an arc from p_after_RDS back to p_after_CR? Actually, RDS should lead to the same state as after CR? 
        But note: after CR we have p_after_CR which is the input to DV. So if we want to re-do DV, we need to put a token in p_after_CR.

    Alternatively, we can have:
        CR: start -> p_after_CR
        DV: p_after_CR -> p_after_DV
        Then from p_after_DV:
            - if documents are complete: FC (p_after_DV -> p_after_FC_input) ... but wait, we haven't defined FC yet.

    Let me reorganize:

        We'll have:
          start_place -> CR -> p1
          p1 -> DV -> p2
          Then from p2, we have:
            - a transition "documents_complete" (silent) -> p3 (which is the input to FC)
            - a transition RDS -> p4 (and then from p4 we go back to p1)

        Similarly for FC:
          p3 -> FC -> p5
          Then from p5:
            - a transition "fraud_check_ok" (silent) -> p6 (input to CA)
            - a transition II -> p7 (and then from p7 back to p3)

        Then CA: p6 -> p8
        Then from p8:
            - if above threshold: AP -> p9 -> P -> p10
            - else: silent_skip_AP -> p10
        Then P: (if skipped, then from p10 we go to P? No, because P is the payment activity. Actually, note: the problem says "The approved claim is paid out", meaning that if skipped we still have to pay? So we need to have P after the skip? 

        Actually, the problem says: 
          "Approval (AP): The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold."
          Then "Payment (P): The approved claim is paid out"

        So if the claim is not approved (because it didn't require approval) then we still pay? 

        Therefore, we can model:
            After CA, we have a place (p8). Then:
                - If above threshold: AP (from p8 to p9) and then P (from p9 to p10)
                - Else: silent_skip (from p8 to p10) and then P? But wait, the payment activity P must be executed in both cases.

        Alternatively, we can have:
            After CA, we have a place p8. Then we have a transition P that can be fired only if we have a token in p8? But then how do we model the approval? 

        Actually, we need to have:
            The payment activity P requires either:
                - a token from AP (if approved) OR
                - a token from the silent skip (if not approved)

        So we can have:
            AP: p8 -> p9
            silent_skip: p8 -> p10
            Then we need a place that merges p9 and p10? 

        We can have a place p11 that is the input to P. Then:
            AP: p8 -> p9, and then an arc from p9 to p11? 
            silent_skip: p8 -> p10, and then an arc from p10 to p11?
        Then P: p11 -> p12

        But note: the problem says "Payment (P): The approved claim is paid out" - but even if not approved? 
        Actually, the problem says "The approved claim" meaning that if it didn't require approval, then it's not an approved claim? 
        However, the payment step is always done. So we can interpret: the payment step is always done, and it is called "Payment".

        So we can have:
            P: from the merge place (p11) to p12.

        Then p12 -> N -> p13 -> CL -> end_place.

 12. We'll create:
      Places: 
        start, end
        p1 (after CR)
        p2 (after DV)
        p3 (after documents_complete, input to FC)
        p4 (after RDS, which goes back to p1)
        p5 (after FC)
        p6 (after fraud_check_ok, input to CA)
        p7 (after II, which goes back to p3)
        p8 (after CA)
        p9 (after AP)
        p10 (after silent_skip_AP) -> then we merge p9 and p10 into p11? Actually, we can have two places? 
        Alternatively, we can have a single place that is the output of both AP and silent_skip? But then we don't need two separate places? 

        Instead, we can have:
            AP: p8 -> p11
            silent_skip: p8 -> p11   (so both go to the same place p11)
        Then P: p11 -> p12
        Then N: p12 -> p13
        Then CL: p13 -> end

 13. So the places we need:
      start, end, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p11, p12, p13.

 14. Transitions and their labels:
      CR: "Claim Registration"
      DV: "Document Verification"
      RDS: "Re-Document Submission" (if incomplete)
      documents_complete: silent (label=None) -> from p2 to p3
      FC: "Fraud Check"
      II: "In-depth Investigation" (if doubts)
      fraud_check_ok: silent (label=None) -> from p5 to p6
      CA: "Claim Assessment"
      AP: "Approval" (if above threshold)
      silent_skip_AP: silent (label=None) (if not above threshold)
      P: "Payment"
      N: "Notification"
      CL: "Closure"

 15. Initial marking: token in start.
      Final marking: token in end.

 16. We'll create the net step by step.

 17. Note: We must use `pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj` and `petri_utils`.

 Let's code accordingly.
</think>
To model the insurance claim management process as an accepting Petri net, we'll create places for each state, transitions for each activity, and connect them with arcs to represent the control flow. The initial marking will have a token in the start place, and the final marking will have a token in the end place. Here's the Python code:

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create Petri net
net = PetriNet(name="Insurance_Claim_Process")

# Create places
start = PetriNet.Place("start")
end = PetriNet.Place("end")
p_after_cr = PetriNet.Place("p_after_cr")
p_after_dv = PetriNet.Place("p_after_dv")
p_after_fc = PetriNet.Place("p_after_fc")
p_after_ca = PetriNet.Place("p_after_ca")
p_after_ap = PetriNet.Place("p_after_ap")
p_after_p = PetriNet.Place("p_after_p")
p_after_n = PetriNet.Place("p_after_n")
p_loop_dv = PetriNet.Place("p_loop_dv")  # For RDS loop
p_loop_fc = PetriNet.Place("p_loop_fc")  # For II loop

# Add places to the net
places = [start, end, p_after_cr, p_after_dv, p_after_fc, p_after_ca, 
          p_after_ap, p_after_p, p_after_n, p_loop_dv, p_loop_fc]
for place in places:
    net.places.add(place)

# Create transitions
cr = PetriNet.Transition("Claim_Registration", "Claim Registration")
dv = PetriNet.Transition("Document_Verification", "Document Verification")
rds = PetriNet.Transition("Re_Document_Submission", "Re-Document Submission")
fc = PetriNet.Transition("Fraud_Check", "Fraud Check")
ii = PetriNet.Transition("In_depth_Investigation", "In-depth Investigation")
ca = PetriNet.Transition("Claim_Assessment", "Claim Assessment")
ap = PetriNet.Transition("Approval", "Approval")
skip_ap = PetriNet.Transition("Skip_Approval", None)  # Silent transition
p = PetriNet.Transition("Payment", "Payment")
n = PetriNet.Transition("Notification", "Notification")
cl = PetriNet.Transition("Closure", "Closure")

# Add transitions to the net
transitions = [cr, dv, rds, fc, ii, ca, ap, skip_ap, p, n, cl]
for transition in transitions:
    net.transitions.add(transition)

# Add arcs
# Start -> CR
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start, cr, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr, p_after_cr, net)

# CR -> DV
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_cr, dv, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, p_after_dv, net)

# DV loop (incomplete documents)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_dv, rds, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds, p_loop_dv, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_loop_dv, dv, net)  # Loop back to DV

# DV -> FC (complete documents)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_dv, fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc, p_after_fc, net)

# FC loop (doubts raised)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_fc, ii, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii, p_loop_fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_loop_fc, fc, net)  # Loop back to FC

# FC -> CA (no doubts)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_fc, ca, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca, p_after_ca, net)

# CA -> AP (if above threshold) OR skip_ap (if below threshold)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_ca, ap, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap, p_after_ap, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_ca, skip_ap, net)

# Merge paths after AP/skip_ap -> P
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_ap, p, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(skip_ap, p, net)  # skip_ap directly connects to P
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p, p_after_p, net)

# P -> N -> CL -> End
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_p, n, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n, p_after_n, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_n, cl, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cl, end, net)

# Initial and final markings
im = Marking()
im[start] = 1  # Initial token in start place

fm = Marking()
fm[end] = 1  # Final token in end place
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Places:** Represent states in the process (e.g., `p_after_cr` after Claim Registration).
2. **Transitions:** Represent activities with their labels (e.g., "Claim Registration"). `skip_ap` is a silent transition (label `None`) for bypassing approval.
3. **Loops:**
   - **RDS Loop:** After DV, if documents are incomplete (`p_after_dv`  `rds`  `p_loop_dv`  back to `dv`).
   - **II Loop:** After FC, if doubts are raised (`p_after_fc`  `ii`  `p_loop_fc`  back to `fc`).
4. **Approval Branching:** After CA, either:
   - `ap` (if above threshold)  `p_after_ap`  `p`, or
   - `skip_ap` (silent transition) directly to `p`.
5. **Final Sequence:** Payment (`p`)  Notification (`n`)  Closure (`cl`)  End place.

This Petri net accurately models the insurance claim process with loops for resubmission/investigation and conditional branching for approval. The initial marking (`im`) has a token in `start`, and the final marking (`fm`) has a token in `end`.
