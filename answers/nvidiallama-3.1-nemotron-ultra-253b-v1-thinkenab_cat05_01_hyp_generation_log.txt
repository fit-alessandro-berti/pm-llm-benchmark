Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We need to identify anomalies in the order_event_log table based on the assumed normal process flow. The normal flow is a sequence of activities from Register Order to Receive Payment. Any deviation from this sequence or missing steps could be an anomaly. Also, activities might be missing, or there might be unexpected behavior like an activity happening before a prerequisite step.

Looking at the example data:

For case_id 1002, after Register Order, the next activity is Confirm Shipment. But according to the normal flow, Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock should happen before Confirm Shipment. So that's a possible anomaly. Also, Perform Credit Check for case 1002 happens after Ship Goods? Wait, looking at the timestamps: case 1002's Perform Credit Check is at 09:10, while Ship Goods is at 08:40. So Ship Goods happened before Perform Credit Check. That's definitely out of order. That's a problem because you shouldn't ship goods before checking credit and validating stock.

Case 1003: After Perform Credit Check, the next activity is Ship Goods. But according to the normal flow, Validate Stock should come before Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods. In case 1003, Validate Stock is missing. So they skipped Validate Stock and went straight to Ship Goods. That's another anomaly.

Case 1004: After Register Order, they immediately Receive Payment. But normally, payment comes after issuing the invoice. Here, Receive Payment happens before Issue Invoice, which is out of sequence. Also, in the normal flow, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, etc., are required. Case 1004 doesn't have Perform Credit Check or Validate Stock. So that's a big problem. They received payment without completing necessary checks.

So the anomalies are:

1. Activities out of order (e.g., Ship Goods before Perform Credit Check in 1002).
2. Missing activities (e.g., case 1003 skipped Validate Stock; case 1004 skipped multiple steps).
3. Receive Payment occurring before Issue Invoice (case 1004).

Now, to hypothesize why these anomalies occur. Possible reasons could be:

- System errors allowing steps to be skipped or reordered.
- Users bypassing protocols (e.g., manually entering events out of sequence).
- Training issues where staff don't follow procedures.
- Integration issues between departments (e.g., Logistics shipping before Finance checks credit).

Next, propose SQL queries to investigate these hypotheses.

For example:

1. Find all cases where Ship Goods occurred before Perform Credit Check.

SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
AND oel2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

This query checks if for the same case, Ship Goods timestamp is before Perform Credit Check.

2. Find cases where Validate Stock was not performed.

SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 END) = 0;

3. Find cases where Receive Payment happened before Issue Invoice.

SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

Also, check for missing steps by comparing the sequence of activities against the expected flow. For example, ensuring each step follows the previous one.

Another approach is to model the correct sequence using window functions and check for deviations.

Additionally, joining with the orders table to see if order type (priority vs standard) correlates with anomalies. Maybe priority orders are rushed, leading to skipped steps.

Check if certain resources are involved in anomalies. For example, maybe LogisticsMgr_2 (from case 1002 and 1003) is associated with out-of-order activities.

Query to see which resources are involved in Ship Goods without prior Validate Stock:

SELECT oel.resource
FROM order_event_log oel
WHERE oel.activity = 'Ship Goods'
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM order_event_log oel2
  WHERE oel2.case_id = oel.case_id
  AND oel2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
  AND oel2.timestamp < oel.timestamp
);

This would help identify if specific resources are bypassing steps.

So overall, the SQL queries should check for out-of-order events, missing events, and unexpected sequences, possibly correlating with resources or order types.

### Identified Anomalies and Hypotheses

1. **Out-of-Order Activities**  
   - **Case 1002**: `Ship Goods` occurred before `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock`.  
   - **Case 1003**: `Ship Goods` occurred before `Validate Stock` and `Confirm Shipment`.  
   - **Case 1004**: `Receive Payment` occurred before `Issue Invoice`, and critical steps like `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock` were skipped entirely.  
   - **Hypothesis**: System integration failures, lack of process enforcement, or training gaps allowing steps to be bypassed.  

2. **Missing Activities**  
   - **Case 1003**: Missing `Validate Stock` activity.  
   - **Case 1004**: Missing `Perform Credit Check`, `Validate Stock`, and `Confirm Shipment`.  
   - **Hypothesis**: Manual overrides, incomplete process documentation, or time-pressure causing shortcuts.  

3. **Premature Confirmations**  
   - **Case 1002 & 1003**: `Confirm Shipment` logged with notes like `attempted_early=Y` or `late_confirmation=Y`, suggesting procedural deviations.  
   - **Hypothesis**: Inconsistent handoffs between departments or unclear escalation protocols.

### Proposed SQL Queries to Investigate Anomalies

#### 1. **Detect Out-of-Order Activities**  
```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id, 
    activity, 
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS step_num
)
SELECT 
  o1.case_id,
  o1.activity AS prev_activity,
  o2.activity AS next_activity
FROM 
  ordered_events o1
JOIN 
  ordered_events o2 
  ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id 
  AND o1.step_num = o2.step_num - 1
WHERE 
  (o1.activity, o2.activity) NOT IN (
    ('Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check'),
    ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock'),
    ('Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment'),
    ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods'),
    ('Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice'),
    ('Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment')
  );
```

**Purpose**: Identify adjacent activity pairs that deviate from the prescribed sequence.

---

#### 2. **Identify Missing Activities**  
```sql
SELECT 
  oel.case_id,
  'Missing ' || unnest(ARRAY['Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment']) AS missing_activity
FROM 
  order_event_log oel
GROUP BY 
  oel.case_id
HAVING 
  ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) <> 
  ARRAY['Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment'];
```

**Purpose**: Flag cases where any step in the standard process is missing.

---

#### 3. **Audit Specific Anomalies**  
**a. Receive Payment Before Invoice**  
```sql
SELECT 
  o1.case_id
FROM 
  order_event_log o1
JOIN 
  order_event_log o2 
  ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id
WHERE 
  o1.activity = 'Receive Payment' 
  AND o2.activity = 'Issue Invoice' 
  AND o1.timestamp < o2.timestamp;
```

**Purpose**: Detect payments received before invoicing.

---

**b. Ship Goods Without Validation**  
```sql
SELECT 
  o1.case_id
FROM 
  order_event_log o1
WHERE 
  o1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM order_event_log o2 
    WHERE o2.case_id = o1.case_id 
    AND o2.activity = 'Validate Stock' 
    AND o2.timestamp < o1.timestamp
  );
```

**Purpose**: Identify shipments without prior stock validation.

---

#### 4. **Resource-Related Anomalies**  
```sql
SELECT 
  oel.resource,
  COUNT(DISTINCT oel.case_id) AS anomaly_count
FROM 
  order_event_log oel
JOIN 
  resources r 
  ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE 
  oel.activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods')
  AND r.department = 'Logistics'
  AND oel.additional_info LIKE '%attempted_early=Y%' 
  OR oel.additional_info LIKE '%late_confirmation=Y%'
GROUP BY 
  oel.resource
ORDER BY 
  anomaly_count DESC;
```

**Purpose**: Highlight resources frequently involved in early/late confirmations.

### Recommendations for Root Cause Analysis  
1. **Process Mining**: Use the above queries to quantify anomalies and prioritize cases for review.  
2. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Investigate roles/departments (e.g., Logistics Managers linked to premature shipments).  
3. **System Checks**: Validate whether the order management system enforces step sequencing.  
4. **Policy Review**: Assess if "priority" orders (from the `orders` table) intentionally bypass certain steps.  

These queries and hypotheses provide a starting point for deeper investigation into systemic or behavioral issues.
