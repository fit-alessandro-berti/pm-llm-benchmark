1. A customer order is registered, which triggers the creation of a transport document.
2. The transport document is then used to book vehicles for transportation.
3. Empty containers are ordered based on the transport document and booked vehicles.
4. Goods are collected and loaded onto handling units.
5. Handling units are loaded onto trucks, which are then driven to a terminal.
6. At the terminal, empty containers are picked up and loaded onto trucks.
7. Loaded containers are weighed, and then placed in stock or brought to a loading bay for further loading onto vehicles.
8. If necessary, containers may be rescheduled, which can involve rebooking vehicles or reloading containers.
9. Containers are loaded onto vehicles, which are then driven to their final destination.

Note that this is just one possible interpretation of the data, and there may be other processes or details that are not captured in the directly follows graph. Additionally, the specific terminology and context may vary depending on the industry or organization.
