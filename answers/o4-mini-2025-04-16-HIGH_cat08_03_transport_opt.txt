1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking  
1.1 Data Preprocessing & Integration  
 • Case conception  
   – Choose “vehicle-day” as primary case ID (e.g. V12-20241205) to capture the full tour.  
   – Link package-level events (Scan at Depot, Arrive/Depart Customer, Delivery Outcome) to that case.  
   – Enrich each event with GPS data (joined by nearest timestamp), dispatch plan (planned stop sequence), and maintenance logs (unscheduled/scheduled stops).  
 • Timestamp alignment & event ordering  
   – Normalize all timestamps to a common timezone and format.  
   – Resolve out-of-order events by sorting on timestamp within each case.  
   – Handle missing or duplicate events (e.g. filter false “Arrive Customer” from GPS-only idles).  
 • Attribute harmonization  
   – Standardize activity names across sources (“Depart Depot” vs “Route Assigned” vs “Start Shift”).  
   – Map location coordinates to semantic areas (depot, customer zones, known traffic hotspots).  
   – Merge driver/vehicle metadata (capacity, vehicle type, driver seniority).  
 • Challenges  
   – Gaps in GPS sampling during urban canyons.  
   – Scanner offline events requiring approximate timestamp imputation.  
   – Multiple events with identical timestamps (tie-breaking by logical sequence).  
   – Joining maintenance logs that may span multiple days.  

1.2 Process Discovery  
 • Apply an inductive or heuristic miner (e.g. in ProM, Disco, Celonis) on the integrated log.  
 • Discover the end-to-end model:  
   – Activities: Start Shift  Route Assigned  Depart Depot  [Travel  Arrive Customer  Delivery Success/Failure  Depart Customer]*  Unscheduled Stop?  Return to Depot  End Shift.  
   – Include loops and XOR splits for failed deliveries ( reattempt or skip), maintenance stops, and traffic-induced idles.  
 • Visualize performance overlay: color-code edges by average travel time or delay frequency.  

1.3 Conformance Checking  
 • Replay actual cases on the planned route model from dispatch:  
   – Sequence deviations:  
     · Skipped stops (planned but not visited)  
     · Additional stops (breakdowns, reroutes)  
     · Reordered stops (due to dynamic rerouting)  
   – Unplanned activities:  
     · Unsched. Stop (engine warning)  
     · Traffic Idle (low-speed events > 5 min)  
   – Timing deviations:  
     · Late departures/arrivals relative to planned schedule  
     · Extended dwell times at customer locations  
 • Metrics: fitness (how many events fit the plan), precision (how many unplanned events), and generalization (variance across cases).  

2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification  
2.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
 • On-Time Delivery Rate = # deliveries within requested window ÷ total attempted deliveries  
 • Avg. Service Time per Stop = mean(Depart Customer – Arrive Customer)  
 • Travel Time vs Service Time Ratio = sum(travel time) ÷ sum(service time)  
 • Fuel Consumption per km/package (if fuel log available)  
 • Vehicle Utilization Rate = (moving time + service time) ÷ shift duration  
 • Traffic Delay Frequency & Duration = count & sum(duration) of low-speed events (> threshold)  
 • Failed Delivery Rate = # Delivery Failed ÷ total planned stops  

2.2 Identifying Bottlenecks  
 • Performance overlay on discovered model: highlight activities or transitions with highest avg. waiting/travel times.  
 • Variant analysis: rank the most frequent route variants and compare their throughput times.  
 • Attribute-based drill-downs:  
   – By route or zone: identify areas with longest travel delays or highest failure rates.  
   – By time of day: morning vs mid-day vs afternoon peak congestion.  
   – By driver: outlier drivers with systematically slower tours or more failed deliveries.  
 • Quantification  
   – Compute cumulative delay per bottleneck (e.g. sum of wait times in Traffic Zone A).  
   – Estimate cost impact: delay_time × cost_per_hour (labor + fuel).  

3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies  
 • Suboptimal Route Planning  
   – Discovery: high-variance deviations from planned sequence; major reordering events.  
   – Root cause: static routes not accounting for daily traffic.  
 • Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations  
   – Discovery: consistent late arrivals vs dispatch ETAs; long tails in travel time distribution.  
   – Root cause: outdated speed assumptions, ignoring time-of-day congestion.  
 • Traffic Congestion Patterns  
   – Discovery: clusters of low-speed events at known intersections during peak hours.  
   – Root cause: no dynamic rerouting around hotspots.  
 • Service Time Variability  
   – Discovery: some customers require >10 min vs average 3 min; high variance correlated with customer type or location.  
   – Root cause: bulky parcels, multi-parcel deliveries, building access issues.  
 • Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance  
   – Discovery: unscheduled stops with long durations; cases with breakdowns have +30% tour time.  
   – Root cause: deferred maintenance or excessive idling.  
 • Driver Behavior  
   – Discovery: certain drivers have higher idle times (breaks vs inefficiencies) or more failed attempts.  
   – Root cause: differences in training, customer handling, route familiarity.  
 • Failed Delivery Attempts  
   – Discovery: repeats for same package on subsequent days; ~10% of stops.  
   – Root cause: narrow time windows, poor customer communication.  
 • Analytical Techniques  
   – Variant comparison (top 10% fastest vs bottom 10% slowest tours).  
   – Correlation analysis between delay durations and external traffic data.  
   – Dwell-time heatmaps by customer location.  

4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies  
Strategy A: Dynamic Real-Time Routing  
 • Targets: high travel-time variability, traffic hotspots.  
 • Root cause: static route plans.  
 • Approach: integrate live traffic feeds + process mining hotspot insights to recalculate next best stop sequence mid-tour.  
 • Expected impact:  
   –  Travel Time per km by 10–15%  
   –  On-Time Delivery Rate by 5–8%  

Strategy B: Territory & Time Window Optimization  
 • Targets: failed delivery rate and service time variability.  
 • Root cause: wide geographic spread within shifts; rigid time windows.  
 • Approach: use historical delivery density and service-time variants to cluster stops into balanced, time-feasible territories; adjust customer slots based on predicted service durations.  
 • Expected impact:  
   –  Failed Deliveries by 30%  
   –  Avg. Service Time per Stop variance by 20%  

Strategy C: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling  
 • Targets: unscheduled stops and long breakdown-induced delays.  
 • Root cause: reactive maintenance.  
 • Approach: mine time-between-failures patterns and unscheduled-stop frequency per vehicle to schedule maintenance just before failure risk peaks.  
 • Expected impact:  
   –  Unscheduled Stop Frequency by 40%  
   –  Vehicle Utilization Rate by 5%  

Strategy D: Targeted Driver Coaching  
 • Targets: driver-specific bottlenecks (long dwell times, inefficiencies).  
 • Root cause: varying skill levels and familiarity.  
 • Approach: identify low-performing drivers via variant analysis, then train on efficient loading/unloading and navigation techniques.  
 • Expected impact:  
   –  Avg. Tour Duration per driver by 8%  
   –  Fuel Efficiency by 3–5%  

5. Operational Constraints & Continuous Monitoring  
5.1 Respecting Constraints  
 • Driver hours: ensure dynamic routes and territories comply with legal shift limits and break requirements.  
 • Vehicle capacity: include parcel volume/weight constraints in route optimization algorithms.  
 • Customer time windows: treat them as hard constraints in dynamic routing and territory design.  

5.2 Monitoring Dashboard Plan  
 • Real-time KPI dashboards:  
   – On-Time Delivery Rate by route, driver, vehicle  
   – Avg. Travel vs Service Time trendlines  
   – Traffic Delay hotspots map overlay  
   – Unscheduled Stop alerts (threshold-based)  
 • Process Views:  
   – Live conformance heatmap (planned vs actual flows)  
   – Variant frequency chart with performance metrics  
   – Root-cause drill-down panels (e.g. failure reasons, maintenance events)  
 • Alerting & Feedback  
   – Automated alerts when On-Time Rate < target or delay spikes in certain zones  
   – Weekly reviews of process deviations and re-calibration of routing parameters  
   – Continuous A/B testing of dynamic vs static routing on pilot fleets
