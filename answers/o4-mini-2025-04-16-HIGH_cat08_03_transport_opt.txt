1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking  
1.1 Data Preprocessing & Integration  
 • Consolidate sources by timestamp and case ID. Create two types of cases:  
   – VehicleDay cases (e.g. V1220241205) to capture the entire trip from depot departure to return.  
   – PackageDelivery cases (e.g. P9876) to analyze individual dropoff events and redelivery attempts.  
 • Harmonize event definitions: map GPS “Depart Depot” to the same activity class as Scanner “Depart Depot,” etc.  
 • Enrich GPS points with geofencing: label “Arrive Customer” when speed=0 within X meters of a delivery address.  
 • Join in dispatch data (planned sequence, time windows) and maintenance logs (break start/end) via vehicleday keys.  
 • Challenges: clock drift between devices, missing or duplicate events, aligning highfrequency GPS with sparse scanner events, merging overlapping maintenance windows with delivery activities.  

1.2 Process Discovery  
 • Use an inductive or heuristic miner on the vehicleday log to derive the actual endtoend flow:  
   – Activities: Start Shift  Depart Depot  Travel  Arrive Customer  Service (Success/Fail)  Depart Customer  Unscheduled Stop (Maintenance/Traffic)  Return Depot  End Shift  
 • Overlay average and caselevel performance metrics (throughtimes, wait times, travel times) on the discovered model.  
 • Identify “loops” (retries after failed delivery), parallel branches (unscheduled stops interleaved with deliveries), and highly variant paths.  

1.3 Conformance Checking  
 • Compare discovered sequences against the planned route sequence per dispatch:  
   – Sequence deviations: visits out of planned order, skipped stops, insertions (e.g. unscheduled stops)  
   – Timing deviations: early/late arrivals relative to customer windows and planned travel times  
   – Quantify fitness (percentage of cases fully conforming), precision (extra behavior), and generalization.  
 • Focus on deviations with high frequency or high delay cost:  
   – Unplanned maintenance stops during shift  
   – Delivery attempts outside time window  
   – Significant detours (GPS track vs. shortest path)  

2. Performance Analysis & Bottleneck Identification  
2.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
 • OnTime Delivery Rate = (deliveries within promised window) / (total deliveries)  
 • Average Time per Delivery Stop = mean(Depart Customer – Arrive Customer)  
 • Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio = total inmotion time : total atcustomer time  
 • Fuel Consumption per km/package (from fuel logs or engine OBD)  
 • Vehicle Utilization Rate = driving time + service time / shift duration  
 • Frequency & Duration of Traffic Delays = count and sum of “Low Speed Detected” segments  
 • Failed Delivery Rate = failed attempts / total attempts  

2.2 Bottleneck Identification via Process Mining  
 • Performanceannotated process maps: highlight activities with longest median/95thpercentile durations.  
 • Throughput time analysis: rank vehicles, routes, drivers by total cycle time (depotdepot).  
 • Variant analysis: identify most common slow variants (e.g. Route A on Mondays 14:00–16:00)  
 • Spatial heatmaps: link GPS delay clusters to specific streets or intersections.  
 • Driver/vehicle comparison: boxplots of average service times per driver, mean delay minutes per vehicle type.  
 • Impact quantification: compute how much total delay (in hours/fuel) stems from top3 bottlenecks.  

3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies  
 • Suboptimal Route Planning  
   – Compare planned vs. actual travel times; high deviation indicates static plans failing under real traffic.  
 • Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations  
   – Correlate dispatch ETA vs. actual arrival; map deviations to time of day and road segments.  
 • Traffic Congestion Patterns  
   – Overlay “Low Speed Detected” events with external traffic data; identify recurring hotspots.  
 • Variability in Service Time  
   – Histogram of service durations per customer type/location; high variance points to training or process issues (e.g. payment handling).  
 • Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance  
   – Frequency of unscheduled stops by vehicle age/type; correlate with maintenance history and miles driven.  
 • Driver Behavior Differences  
   – Benchmark fuel consumption per km by driver; detect aggressive acceleration/braking via GPS speed profiles.  
 • Failed Delivery Attempts  
   – Cluster failed stops by time window, customer area; correlate with planned vs. actual arrival times.  

   Use variantbased root cause analysis:  
   – Compare top 10% fastest vs. bottom 10% slowest routes to surface distinguishing factors (route length, traffic, driver).  
   – Correlate delay minutes with number of failed attempts or unscheduled stops per case.  

4. DataDriven Optimization Strategies  
4.1 Dynamic, RealTime Routing Adjustments  
 • Targets: trafficinduced delays, sequence deviations  
 • Root Cause: static route plans not reflecting live conditions  
 • Insight Basis: GPS delay clusters, planned vs. actual traveltime deviations  
 • Action: integrate realtime traffic API with a routing engine; automatically resequence remaining stops when projected delay > threshold  
 • Expected Impact:  OnTime Delivery Rate,  average travel time per stop,  fuel consumption  

4.2 Territory & Route Sequence Optimization  
 • Targets: inefficient stop sequences, uneven driver workloads  
 • Root Cause: suboptimal clustering of stops, manual route assignments  
 • Insight Basis: process variants showing which sequences yield lowest cycle times; geographic clustering analysis  
 • Action: use historical data to cluster stops into balanced, timewindow–feasible territories, then solve capacitated vehicle routing with time windows (CVRPTW) optimizing for minimal travel time  
 • Expected Impact:  travel/service time ratio,  vehicle utilization,  overtime  

4.3 Predictive Maintenance Scheduling  
 • Targets: unscheduled breakdown stops, high maintenance costs  
 • Root Cause: reactive maintenance leading to inshift repairs  
 • Insight Basis: correlation of mileage/engine warnings with unscheduled stops in event log  
 • Action: build a usagebased maintenance model (e.g. after X hours driving or Y stops) to schedule dedicated maintenance windows outside peak delivery hours  
 • Expected Impact:  unscheduled downtime,  utilization rate,  perkm maintenance cost  

4.4 Targeted Driver Training & Coaching  
 • Targets: high servicetime variance, fuel inefficiency  
 • Root Cause: inconsistent driver practices (e.g. slow customer interactions, harsh driving)  
 • Insight Basis: driverlevel performance benchmarks on service time and fuel per km  
 • Action: produce individualized coaching plans, share bestpractice variants, incentivize adherence to target service times  
 • Expected Impact:  average time per stop,  fuel consumption per km,  consistency (lower variance)  

5. Operational Constraints & Continuous Monitoring  
5.1 Accounting for Constraints  
 • Embed driver HoursofService rules into dynamic routing engine to prevent overtime.  
 • Respect vehicle capacity and weight limits when optimizing territories.  
 • Enforce customer time windows as hard constraints in route planning and rerouting logic.  

5.2 PostImplementation Monitoring Plan  
 • Set up a processmining dashboard with live KPIs:  
   – Trend lines for OnTime Delivery Rate, Travel vs. Service Time Ratio, Failed Delivery Rate  
   – Bottleneck heatmaps: geographic and temporal delay hotspots  
   – Conformance metrics: % of trips matching planned sequence and travel times within tolerance  
   – Maintenance alerts: unscheduled stops flagged in near real time  
 • Define SLAs and alerts for KPI breaches (e.g. ontime rate drops below 95%).  
 • Quarterly deepdive using new event log to rediscover process variants, confirm that top bottlenecks have shifted or been resolved, and iterate on optimization strategies.
