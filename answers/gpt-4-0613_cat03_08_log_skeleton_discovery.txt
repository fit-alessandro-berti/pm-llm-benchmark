Building a Log Skeleton model requires analyzing sequences of activities in the provided process variants. However, the information necessary to generate one is missing in your question. Let's consider a simpler example and map it to a Log Skeleton model.

Say we have two process variants:
1. A -> B -> C (frequency=3)
2. B -> A -> C -> D (frequency=2)

From above, the following dictionary can be constructed:
- `equivalence`: {(A, B), (B, C), (A, C)}
- `always_before`: {(A, B), (A, C), (B, C), (B, D)}
- `always_after`: {(B, A), (C, B), (C, A), (D, C)}
- `never_together`: {}
- `activ_freq`: {'A': {3, 2}, 'B': {3, 2}, 'C': {3, 2}, 'D': {2}}
- `directly_follows`: {(A, B), (B, C), (A, C), (B, A), (C, D)}

Note this is a simplification. In reality you would have to examine and map all variants of the sequences to create a more complex log skeleton model. However, with the current information provided in your question, doing the above for each activity, pairs of activities and combination is not possible. The performance and frequency in the variants provided do not correlate directly to the keys in the dictionary for the log skeleton model.

Additional details such as the specific rules and constraints for the given process will be required to create a more accurate Log Skeleton model. 
An automatic tool, such as process mining software, could be more suitable for this task as the complexity increases.
