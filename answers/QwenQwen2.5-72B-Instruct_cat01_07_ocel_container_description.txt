2. **Container Management:**
   - Empty containers are ordered and picked up.
   - Containers are loaded onto trucks and driven to the terminal.
   - At the terminal, containers are weighed and either placed in stock or brought to the loading bay.
   - Containers in stock are brought to the loading bay when needed.

3. **Loading and Dispatch:**
   - Containers are brought to the loading bay and loaded onto vehicles.
   - Vehicles are loaded and then depart.
   - If necessary, containers are rescheduled, and the process is repeated.

4. **Forklift Operations:**
   - Forklifts are used to move containers between different stages of the process, such as from the stock area to the loading bay, or from the loading bay to the vehicle.

5. **Vehicle Management:**
   - Vehicles are booked and rebooked as needed.
   - Vehicles are loaded and dispatched multiple times.

### Key Activities and Interactions

- **Loading and Unloading:** This is a central activity involving trucks, containers, and forklifts.
- **Rescheduling:** Containers are frequently rescheduled, indicating flexibility in the process.
- **Transport Documentation:** The creation and management of transport documents are crucial for coordinating the entire process.
- **Terminal Operations:** Weighing and stock management at the terminal ensure that containers are ready for loading and dispatch.

This process is highly interconnected, with multiple object types and activities working together to manage the flow of goods from collection to dispatch.
