Okay, I need to create two POWL models based on the description of GlobalTeq Solutions' hiring process. The first one should include a potential unfairness due to the community affiliation check, and the second one should remove that bias. Let me break down the steps.

First, the hiring process has several stages: ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo (if needed), SkillAssessment, then either a standard CulturalFitCheck or a CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

For the first model with potential unfairness, the key is to have an XOR branch where one path is the standard cultural fit and the other is the community affiliation check. The community affiliation check would give a slight advantage, which is the unfairness. So I need to model that XOR choice.

In the second model, there should be no such XOR. All applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck. So the XOR is removed, and only the standard check is present.

Let me start by identifying the activities and their order. The process starts with receiving an application, then checking data completeness. If there's missing info, they loop back to request more info. Then the skill assessment. After that, the XOR choice between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So for the first model (with unfairness), the steps are:

1. ReceiveApplication
2. DataCompletenessCheck
3. If missing info, loop to RequestMoreInfo
4. SkillAssessment
5. XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck
6. Then ManagerialReview
7. FinalDecision

For the second model (without unfairness), the steps are:

1. ReceiveApplication
2. DataCompletenessCheck
3. If missing info, loop to RequestMoreInfo
4. SkillAssessment
5. CulturalFitCheck (no XOR)
6. Then ManagerialReview
7. FinalDecision

Now, I need to translate this into POWL models. Let's start with the first model. The XOR is between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. The other model has only CulturalFitCheck.

So in the first model, after SkillAssessment, there's an XOR between two transitions: CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, after that, the ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

In the second model, after SkillAssessment, there's only the CulturalFitCheck.

I need to make sure that the XOR in the first model is explicitly present, while the second model doesn't have that. Also, the loop for data completeness is handled by a loop structure.

Let me structure the first model. The loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Then SkillAssessment is next. Then the XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

For the second model, after SkillAssessment, it's only CulturalFitCheck, then the same steps.

Now, translating this into the POWL syntax. The activities are labeled as per the description.

First model:

- ReceiveApplication
- DataCompletenessCheck
- RequestMoreInfo (loop)
- SkillAssessment
- XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck
- Then ManagerialReview
- Then FinalDecision

Second model:

- Same steps except after SkillAssessment, it's only CulturalFitCheck.

So the first model's XOR is between two activities, while the second model has only one.

I need to use the StrictPartialOrder and OperatorPOWL classes. The XOR is an OperatorPOWL with operator=Operator.XOR and children as the two transitions. The loop is handled by a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo.

Wait, the loop is a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So in the first model, the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop that may go to RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back.

But according to the original description, the loop is a loop that checks for missing info. So the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Wait, no. The loop is triggered when missing info. So the process is: after DataCompletenessCheck, if missing info, then RequestMoreInfo is executed, and then the loop continues until the resume is complete.

So perhaps the loop is a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. But the loop is a loop that starts with DataCompletenessCheck, then RequestMoreInfo, and then back to DataCompletenessCheck? Or maybe the loop is a loop that starts after DataCompletenessCheck, which may trigger RequestMoreInfo, and then the loop continues until the resume is complete.

Alternatively, maybe the DataCompletenessCheck is a node that, if not complete, triggers a loop. But the original description says that if missing info, the applicant is asked to provide additional details, which would be the RequestMoreInfo activity, and then the process loops back to check again.

So perhaps the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop that includes RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck until the resume is complete.

But in the POWL model, how to represent that. Maybe the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop that includes RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck. But the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo.

Alternatively, the DataCompleityCheck is followed by a loop, which includes RequestMoreInfo, and then the loop ends when the resume is complete.

But maybe the loop is a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo, meaning that after DataCompletenessCheck, you go to RequestMoreInfo, and then back to DataCompletenessCheck again until the resume is complete.

In the POWL model, that would be a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop is a loop that starts at DataCompletenessCheck, then transitions to RequestMoreInfo, and then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck. But how is that represented?

Alternatively, the loop is a loop that starts after DataCompletenessCheck, which is followed by RequestMoreInfo. Then RequestMoreInfo is followed by DataCompletenessCheck again, creating a loop.

But perhaps the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo, so that when you process DataCompletenessCheck, you may go to RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck. So that would be a loop between the two activities.

So in the first model, the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop between itself and RequestMoreInfo. Then, after the loop, the SkillAssessment is next.

So in the first model, the sequence is:

ReceiveApplication -> DataCompletenessCheck -> loop (DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo) -> SkillAssessment -> XOR (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

But how to represent the loop in POWL. The loop is a loop between two nodes. So perhaps the loop is an OperatorPOWL with operator=Operator.LOOP, and children as DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Wait, but the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So maybe the loop is a loop that starts with DataCompletenessCheck, then RequestMoreInfo, then back to DataCompletenessCheck.

But in POWL, the loop operator is used when you have a loop between two activities. So the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So in the model, after DataCompletenessCheck, there is a loop that includes RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck.

Alternatively, maybe the loop is a loop that starts after DataCompletenessCheck, which is followed by RequestMoreInfo, and then the loop ends when the resume is complete. But that's not clear. However, the original description says that the loop is triggered when missing info, so the loop is a loop that continues until the resume is complete. Therefore, the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo.

So in the first model, the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop between itself and RequestMoreInfo. Wait, no. The loop is between the DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the process is: after DataCompletenessCheck, you go to RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck again until the resume is complete.

So in the POWL model, the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop that includes RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck.

But how to represent that in the code. Maybe the loop is between the DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop is an OperatorPOWL with operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo].

But that might not be correct. Because the loop is between two activities. So the loop starts at DataCompletenessCheck, then goes to RequestMoreInfo, then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck again.

So in the model, after DataCompletenessCheck, the loop is executed, which includes RequestMoreInfo, and then the loop continues.

Alternatively, the loop is a loop that starts after DataCompletenessCheck, and the loop includes RequestMoreInfo, then back to DataCompletenessCheck.

But in the code, the loop would be represented as a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo.

So in the first model, the steps are:

ReceiveApplication -> DataCompletenessCheck -> loop (DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo) -> SkillAssessment -> XOR (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

But how to structure that in the code. Let me think.

The first model:

- The loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop that includes RequestMoreInfo, which loops back to DataCompletenessCheck.

So in the code, the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop, which is an OperatorPOWL with children [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo], and operator=Operator.LOOP.

Wait, but that's not right. Because the loop is between the DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop is a loop that starts at DataCompletenessCheck, then goes to RequestMoreInfo, then back to DataCompletenessCheck again.

But in the code, the loop is represented as a loop between two nodes. So the loop is an OperatorPOWL with operator=Operator.LOOP and children [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo]. Then, after the loop, the SkillAssessment is next.

But perhaps that's not correct. Because the loop is between the DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by the loop, which includes RequestMoreInfo. But the loop is a loop that continues until the resume is complete. So the loop is a loop that starts with DataCompletenessCheck, then RequestMoreInfo, then back to DataCompletenessCheck again.

Therefore, in the code, the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop that includes RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck.

So the code would have:

- DataCompletenessCheck is followed by a loop (OperatorPOWL with operator=Operator.LOOP and children [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo]).

But that would create a loop between the two nodes. So the loop is between the DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Therefore, after DataCompletenessCheck, the loop is executed, which includes RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck.

But in the code, how is that represented? The loop is an OperatorPOWL that includes the two activities as children, and the operator is LOOP. Then, after the loop, the SkillAssessment is next.

So the first model's structure would be:

ReceiveApplication -> DataCompletenessCheck -> loop (DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo) -> SkillAssessment -> XOR (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

In the code, that would be:

- The loop is an OperatorPOWL with operator=Operator.LOOP and children [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo].

Then, after the loop, the SkillAssessment is next.

But in the code, the loop is between the DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the DataCompletenessCheck is followed by the loop, which is followed by the SkillAssessment.

But how is that structured in the code? The loop is a node that is executed after DataCompletenessCheck, and then the SkillAssessment is after the loop.

So the code would have:

ReceiveApplication is a Transition.

Then DataCompletenessCheck is a Transition, followed by the loop (OperatorPOWL with children [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo]).

Then after the loop, the SkillAssessment is a Transition.

Then the XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

But in the code, the loop is an OperatorPOWL that is part of the model. So the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo.

But perhaps the loop is between the DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo, so that after DataCompletenessCheck, the loop is executed, which includes RequestMoreInfo, and then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck.

Therefore, the first model's code would be:

Model 1:

- ReceiveApplication
- DataCompletenessCheck
- Loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo
- SkillAssessment
- XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck
- ManagerialReview
- FinalDecision

Now, for the second model, the loop is the same, but after the SkillAssessment, it's only the CulturalFitCheck, not the XOR.

So the second model's code would be:

- ReceiveApplication
- DataCompletenessCheck
- Loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo
- SkillAssessment
- CulturalFitCheck
- ManagerialReview
- FinalDecision

But how to represent that in code. The XOR is only in the first model.

Now, translating this into the POWL code.

For the first model (unfairness):

- The loop is an OperatorPOWL with operator=Operator.LOOP and children [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo]. Then, after the loop, the SkillAssessment is next.

Then, after the SkillAssessment, there's an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Then, after that, the ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So the code would have:

A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
F = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E, F])

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, B, loop, D, xor, G, H])

# Adding partial order constraints
root.order.add_edge(A, B)
root.order.add_edge(B, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, D)
root.order.add_edge(D, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, G)
root.order.add_edge(G, H)

Wait, but the loop is between B and C. So the loop is an OperatorPOWL with children [B, C]. Then, after the loop, the D (SkillAssessment) is next.

But the loop is a loop that starts with B (DataCompletenessCheck), then goes to C (RequestMoreInfo), then back to B again.

So the loop is between B and C. Then after the loop, D (SkillAssessment) is executed.

So the code would have:

root.order.add_edge(A, B)
root.order.add_edge(B, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, D)
root.order.add_edge(D, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, G)
root.order.add_edge(G, H)

But how does the loop work? The loop is between B and C. So the loop is executed after B, and during the loop, it goes to C, and then loops back to B. So in the code, the loop is an OperatorPOWL with children [B, C], so that when the loop is executed, it goes through B and C in a loop.

But in the code, the order is such that after B, the loop is executed, which includes C, then back to B again.

But the code as written would have B followed by the loop, which is followed by D.

But the loop is between B and C. So the loop is a loop that starts with B, then C, then B again, etc.

But in the code, the loop is an OperatorPOWL, and after the loop, the D is executed.

So that seems correct.

Now, the second model without unfairness:

Same loop, but after the SkillAssessment, it's only the CulturalFitCheck.

So the code would be:

A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, B, loop, D, E, G, H])

root.order.add_edge(A, B)
root.order.add_edge(B, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, D)
root.order.add_edge(D, E)
root.order.add_edge(E, G)
root.order.add_edge(G, H)

But in the first model, the XOR is between E and F (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck), and then the XOR is followed by G and H.

But in the second model, after D (SkillAssessment), it's E (CulturalFitCheck) directly.

Thus, the first model has the XOR, and the second model does not.

Therefore, the two models are as described.
</think>

Here are the two **POWL models** representing the hiring process at **GlobalTeq Solutions**, with and without the potential for bias due to community affiliation checks:

---

### **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**  
This model includes an **XOR branch** that introduces bias by favoring applicants with community affiliations.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
F = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop (between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])

# Define XOR branch (CulturalFitCheck vs. CommunityAffiliationCheck)
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E, F])

# Construct the root model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, B, loop, D, xor, G, H])

# Add partial order constraints
root.order.add_edge(A, B)
root.order.add_edge(B, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, D)
root.order.add_edge(D, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, G)
root.order.add_edge(G, H)
```

---

### **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**  
This model ensures **no XOR branch** and all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop (between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])

# Construct the root model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, B, loop, D, E, G, H])

# Add partial order constraints
root.order.add_edge(A, B)
root.order.add_edge(B, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, D)
root.order.add_edge(D, E)
root.order.add_edge(E, G)
root.order.add_edge(G, H)
```

### **Key Differences**  
1. **Unfairness Model (Model 1)**:  
   - Includes an **XOR branch** between `CulturalFitCheck` and `CommunityAffiliationCheck`.  
   - The `CommunityAffiliationCheck` gives a **subtle advantage** to applicants with local community ties, creating a bias.  

2. **Fairness Model (Model 2)**:  
   - Removes the **XOR branch** entirely.  
   - All applicants undergo the **same** `CulturalFitCheck`, ensuring a **merit-based** evaluation.  

Both models include a **loop** for data completeness and a **sequential** flow of skill assessments, but the **XOR choice** is the critical distinction in the first model.
