### Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process

#### **Normative Process Summary:**
1. **Start:** Always begins with "Receive order."
2. **Check Inventory:** Must occur immediately after "Receive order."
3. **Sufficient Inventory Path:**
   - "Authorize payment"  "Package items"  "Ship order"  "Close order."
4. **Insufficient Inventory Path:**
   - "Cancel order"  "Close order."
5. **Key Constraints:**
   - "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."
   - "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
   - "Ship order" must occur after "Package items" and never after "Cancel order."
   - "Close order" must be the final activity in all cases.

### **Case-by-Case Analysis:**

#### **Case 1:**
- Sequence:
  `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Package items`  `Ship order`  `Close order`
- **Compliance:** **Fully compliant.**
  - Follows the sufficient inventory path correctly.
  - No violations detected.

#### **Case 2:**
- Sequence:
  `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Package items`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`
- **Violations:**
  1. **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment":**
     - The normative process states that "Authorize payment" must occur before "Package items."
     - This is a clear violation of the expected sequence.
  2. **"Ship order" occurs after "Package items" but without proper payment authorization first:**
     - While "Ship order" follows "Package items," the payment was not authorized before packaging, which is incorrect.

#### **Case 3:**
- Sequence:
  `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Cancel order`  `Ship order`  `Close order`
- **Violations:**
  1. **"Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order":**
     - If inventory is insufficient, the process should go directly to "Cancel order" without authorizing payment.
     - Authorizing payment implies sufficient inventory, which contradicts the later "Cancel order."
  2. **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order":**
     - The normative process explicitly states that "Ship order" should never occur after cancellation.
     - This is a severe violation.

#### **Case 4:**
- Sequence:
  `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Cancel order`  `Close order`
- **Compliance:** **Fully compliant.**
  - Follows the insufficient inventory path correctly.
  - No violations detected.

#### **Case 5:**
- Sequence:
  `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`
- **Violations:**
  1. **"Ship order" occurs without "Package items":**
     - The normative process requires "Package items" before "Ship order."
     - Skipping packaging is a violation.

### **Summary of Violations:**
| Case ID | Violation Description                                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2       | "Package items" before "Authorize payment"; improper sequence.                       |
| 3       | "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order"; "Ship order" after cancellation.         |
| 5       | "Ship order" without prior "Package items."                                         |

### **Compliant Cases:**
- **Case 1:** Fully compliant (sufficient inventory path).
- **Case 4:** Fully compliant (insufficient inventory path).

### **Key Observations:**
- The most common violations involve:
  - Incorrect sequencing of "Authorize payment" and "Package items."
  - Shipping orders without proper packaging or after cancellation.
- The normative process is strict about the order of activities, especially regarding payment authorization and cancellation logic.
