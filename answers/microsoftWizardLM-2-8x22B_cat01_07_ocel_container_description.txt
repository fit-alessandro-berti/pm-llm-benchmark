 The event log data provided describes the process flow for various object types within a logistics or supply chain operation. Each object type represents a different entity in the process, such as Handling Units, Trucks, Containers, Vehicles, Forklifts, Customer Orders, and Transport Documents. The directly follows graph indicates the sequence of activities for each object type, along with the frequency of events, the number of objects involved, and the average duration between activities. Here's a breakdown of the process for each object type:

**Handling Unit:**
- The process begins with collecting goods, which is directly followed by loading the truck. This sequence occurs 10,553 times, involving 10,553 unique handling units, with an average duration of 7820.93 time units between these activities.

**Truck:**
- Trucks are loaded multiple times (8,559 events), with only 6 unique trucks involved. The average duration between each loading event is 5259.71 time units.
- After being loaded, a truck may either load more goods, drive to a terminal, or unload at the terminal and then load again. The driving and unloading activities have much higher durations (10999.07 and 84119.09 time units, respectively) compared to repeated loading.

**Container:**
- Containers are loaded onto trucks frequently (8,559 events), with 1,896 unique containers. The duration between loading events is the same as for trucks (5259.71 time units).
- Empty containers are ordered and then picked up before being loaded onto trucks. This part of the process has a very high duration (368943.92 time units) from ordering to picking up an empty container.
- After a container is loaded onto a truck, it may be driven to a terminal, weighed, placed in stock, or brought to a loading bay. These activities involve various durations, with the longest being from the terminal to placing in stock (743380.51 time units).
- Some containers may be rescheduled, which involves a complex sequence of activities with high durations, indicating potential delays or waiting times in the process.

**Vehicle:**
- Vehicles are loaded with containers, and this activity can occur multiple times for the same vehicle (1,827 events for 127 unique vehicles). The average duration between loadings is 1960.59 time units.
- Vehicles are also booked, which seems to be a lengthy process (duration of 295965.56 time units for repeated bookings).
- The process from booking a vehicle to loading it, and then to departure, involves various durations, with the longest being from booking to loading (283101.01 time units).
- Rescheduling of containers also affects vehicles, with long durations indicating potential disruptions in the scheduling process.

**Forklift:**
- Forklifts are used to bring containers to loading bays, load them onto vehicles, weigh them, and place them in stock. These activities involve a small number of forklifts (3 unique forklifts) with varying durations.
- Some activities have extremely high durations (e.g., place in stock to bring to loading bay at 1,126,00.53 time units), which could indicate inefficiencies or waiting times in the process.

**Customer Order:**
- Customer orders are registered and then transport documents are created. This sequence occurs 594 times with a high average duration of 329005.22 time units, suggesting a potential bottleneck or delay in processing customer orders.

**Transport Document:**
- Once created, transport documents are used to book vehicles and order empty containers. The process from booking vehicles to the departure of the vehicle has a very high duration (1,007,066.16 time units), indicating a significant time gap, possibly due to scheduling, preparation, or waiting times.
- Rescheduling of containers is also reflected in the transport document process, with high durations suggesting that changes in scheduling can cause substantial delays.

Overall, the process involves multiple entities and handoffs, with activities such as loading, booking, and rescheduling being critical points that could benefit from further analysis and optimization. The high durations associated with certain activities suggest that there may be opportunities to improve efficiency, reduce waiting times, and streamline the flow of goods from collection to departure.
