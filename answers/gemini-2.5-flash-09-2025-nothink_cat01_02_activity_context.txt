## Analysis and Renaming of Complex Workflow Activities

The goal is to disambiguate recurring activity names ("Verify Documents" and "Call Customer") by adding contextual information derived from the "Additional Context" column and their sequential position in the log.

### 1. Identification of Recurring Activities and Contextual Analysis

The activities that recur with different meanings are:

| Original Activity | Case ID | Sequential Context / Clue | Proposed New Contextual Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Verify Documents** | C001 | First instance (09:20:00). Followed by a need for more documents. | Initial check, potentially failed or incomplete. |
| **Verify Documents** | C001 | Second instance (10:30:00). Follows a `Submit Additional` step. | Re-verification after receiving missing information. |
| **Verify Documents** | C003 | First instance (11:25:00). Initial physical check. | Initial verification at the branch. |
| **Verify Documents** | C003 | Second instance (12:20:00). Follows an `Adjust Account` step. | Re-verification after internal data correction. |
| **Call Customer** | C001 | First instance (09:45:00). Context: "request missing docs." | Outbound call specifically to gather missing information. |
| **Call Customer** | C002 | First instance (09:00:00). Context: "clarify account discrepancy." | Outbound call for clarification/investigation. |
| **Call Customer** | C002 | Second instance (09:50:00). Context: "confirm adjustments made." | Follow-up call to confirm internal actions. |
| **Call Customer** | C003 | Single instance (11:50:00). Context: "calls to have them return." | Operational call to manage customer presence. |

### 4. Justification of Naming Choices

| Original Activity | New Activity Name(s) | Justification (Contextual Clue) |
|---|---|---|
| **Verify Documents** | Initial Document Verification | This is the first verification step in every case, usually leading to the next decision point (success or deficiency). |
| | Re-Verify Documents (Post-Submission) | Used in C001 after the customer submitted *additional* documents, indicating a cyclical loop due to initial failure. |
| | Initial Document Verification (Physical) | Used in C003 to denote the physical, branch-based nature of the verification, differentiating it from remote checks. |
| | Re-Verify Documents (Post-Adjustment) | Used in C003 after an internal `Adjust Account` step, signifying a mandatory compliance check following data modification. |
| **Call Customer** | Call: Request Missing Documentation | Used in C001; the context explicitly states the purpose is to request missing items to progress the case. |
| | Call: Clarify Account Discrepancy | Used as the first call in C002, tied to investigation and clarification necessary before internal action (`Adjust Account`). |
| | Call: Confirm Account Adjustments | Used as the second call in C002, acting as a crucial confirmation step *after* internal action has been taken. |
| | Call: Operational Customer Management | Used in C003; this call is unrelated to document deficiency or account status; it is purely procedural management of a physically present (or temporarily absent) customer. |
