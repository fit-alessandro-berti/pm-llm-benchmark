1. What the model lets happen  

- After the order is received you may **skip** the credit check (silent “skip” branch of the XOR).  
- If the check is skipped you still go on to the “Approve-Order / Issue-Invoice loop”.  
- Everything placed inside that loop can be executed any number of times  1:  
– Approve_Order alone  
– Approve_Order  Issue_Invoice  Approve_Order  Issue_Invoice  … (as many full cycles as you like)  
– Issue_Invoice alone (but only after the first Approve_Order has been done once)  
- Only when you finally quit the loop do you reach payment and, finally, Close_Order.

2. Why those constructs are anomalies for Order-to-Cash  

| Construct | Normal expectation | What the model allows | Risk / Impact |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| XOR skip on “Check_Credit” | Credit-worthiness has to be verified before an order is accepted and goods/services released. | Credit check can be completely omitted for any order. | Financial risk (unpaid deliveries), write-offs, regulatory non-compliance.  Leads to non-conforming traces when real event logs are checked. |
| LOOP around Approve_Order and Issue_Invoice | Approval and invoicing happen exactly once per order (with possible re-work expressed as a separate “change order” process). | Any number of extra approvals and invoices can be created, even after payment is technically possible. |  – Redundant invoices  customer confusion, credit-notes, dunning cost. <br> – Uncontrolled re-approval can mask internal fraud or data-entry errors. <br> – KPIs on “first-time-right” and cycle time are distorted; conformance-checking tools will flag almost every real trace as deviant. |

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Concrete traces that the model legalises but a business would forbid  

1. Receive_Order  Approve_Order  Issue_Invoice (×3)  Receive_Payment  Close_Order  
   (triple invoicing, no payment objection modelled)  

2. Receive_Order  (credit check skipped)  Approve_Order  Issue_Invoice  Receive_Payment  Close_Order  
   (order processed without any solvency verification)  

Both sequences are perfectly valid in the POWL model; they violate basic OTC controls and will appear as “positive outliers” in any conformance check run on real data, lowering fitness and precision scores.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Recommendations  

- Replace the credit-check XOR with a single mandatory transition (or, if partial orders are still desired, keep the XOR but add a compliance rule that the “skip” branch is never taken).  
- Remove the loop or change it to a **rework operator** that can fire at most once and only after an exception (e.g., Invoice_Corrected).  
- Introduce explicit data constraints: “Issue_Invoice” is enabled only if “Check_Credit = OK” is true.  

Fixing these two constructs restores the classical, compliant Order-to-Cash behaviour and removes the structural work-around patterns that currently invite operational and financial risk.
