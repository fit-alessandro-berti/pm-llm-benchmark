**1. Process Discovery & Conformance Checking**  

---

### 1.1 Data preprocessing & integration  

| Source | Typical fields | Integration challenges |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| **GPS trackers** | `timestamp, lat, lon, speed, ignition, status` | • High‑frequency sampling → many duplicate events. <br>• Missing values when signal lost (e.g. tunnels). <br>• Need to map raw coordinates to *semantic* locations (depot, customer address, road segment). |
| **Driver scanners** | `timestamp, event_type (Arrive, Delivery‑Success, …), package_id, location` | • Manual entry errors (wrong package ID, mistyped). <br>• Different time‑zones / clock drift between devices. |
| **Dispatch system** | `vehicle_id, driver_id, planned_route (ordered stop list), time‑windows, vehicle_capacity` | • Planned route stored as a *static list*; must be exploded into one “planned event” per stop. <br>• May contain updates (re‑routing) that need versioning. |
| **Maintenance logs** | `vehicle_id, start, end, type (scheduled/unscheduled), mileage, notes` | • Overlaps with delivery shifts (downtime must be flagged as *unavailable*). <br>• Different granularity (some logs only daily). |

**Integration pipeline (typical ETL steps)**  

1. **Timestamp harmonisation** – Convert all timestamps to UTC, round to the nearest second.  
2. **Entity resolution** –  
   * Join on `vehicle_id` + `date` → **Case ID** (`Vehicle‑Day`).  
   * Join on `package_id` where present (scanner) → link to the corresponding stop in the dispatch plan.  
3. **Location enrichment** –  
   * Use a GIS lookup (e.g., OpenStreetMap) to map GPS coordinates → *named locations* (depot, street‑address, “traffic‑hotspot”).  
   * Attach *road‑segment IDs* for later traffic‑correlation.  
4. **Event normalisation** – Create a canonical event schema:  

   ```plaintext
   case_id, activity, timestamp, resource (driver/vehicle), 
   location, duration, cost_metrics (fuel, km), 
   related_object (package_id), notes
   ```  

5. **Missing‑event inference** –  
   * Insert “Travel” events between consecutive stops using GPS traces (distance & speed → estimated travel time).  
   * Derive “Idle” or “Waiting” events when speed ≈ 0 for > 2 min at a location.  

**Typical challenges**  

* **Event granularity mismatch** – GPS provides many “low‑level” events, scanners only at stops. Solution: aggregate GPS into *travel* activities and keep scanner events as *service* activities.  
* **Clock drift & duplicate timestamps** – Apply a tolerance window (± 1 s) and deduplicate.  
* **Partial data** – Some vehicles may lack scanner logs (e.g., due to device failure). Use GPS‑derived “pseudo‑service” events (stop detection via speed drop).  
* **Dynamic re‑routing** – If a driver deviates from the planned order, the dispatch plan must be versioned; keep both *original plan* and *actual executed plan* for conformance analysis.  

---

### 1.2 Process discovery  

* **Algorithm choice** –  
  * **Inductive Miner** (IM) for a sound, block‑structured model that handles noise and infrequent behaviour.  
  * **Heuristics Miner** for a more “fuzzy” view when many exceptions exist (e.g., traffic‑induced detours).  
* **Model granularity** – Two‑level model:  
  1. **High‑level**: `Depart Depot → Travel → Service (Delivery/Failed) → Travel → … → Return Depot`.  
  2. **Detailed**: Split “Travel” into *road‑segment* activities (e.g., `Travel_100‑Main‑St → Travel_101‑Elm‑St`).  
* **Incorporating time & resources** – Use *performance‑enhanced* discovery (e.g., **Fuzzy Miner** with time annotations) to colour activities by average duration and variance.  

The resulting Petri net (or BPMN) will expose:

* **Loops** – e.g., re‑visiting a stop after a failed delivery.  
* **Parallelism** – multiple vehicles operating concurrently (use “resource” token to differentiate).  
* **Silent transitions** – “Travel” activities that are not directly logged but inferred from GPS.  

---

### 1.3 Conformance checking  

* **Alignment** – Align each *actual trace* (derived from the integrated log) with the *planned model* (derived from the dispatch plan).  
* **Deviation types to detect**  

| Type | Description | Example in log |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Sequence deviation** | Actual order of stops differs from planned order. | Stop 5 delivered before Stop 3. |
| **Missing activity** | Planned stop never appears (e.g., skipped). | No scanner event for a planned package. |
| **Unplanned activity** | An activity not in the plan (e.g., unscheduled maintenance stop). | `Unscheduled Stop` at 11:05. |
| **Timing deviation** | Large difference between planned service‑window and actual arrival. | Arrival at 08:10 vs. window 07:45‑08:00. |
| **Resource deviation** | Different driver or vehicle than assigned. | Driver D105 swapped with D110 mid‑shift. |
| **Duration deviation** | Travel time far exceeds estimated distance (possible traffic). | 5 km segment taking 30 min. |

* **Metrics** – Compute *fitness* (percentage of perfectly aligned events) and *precision* (how much extra behaviour is observed). Use **alignment cost** (e.g., number of moves on log) to rank the most problematic cases.

**2. Performance Analysis & Bottleneck Identification**  

---

### 2.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI | Definition | Calculation (from event log) |
|-----|------------|------------------------------|
| **On‑Time Delivery Rate (OTDR)** | % of deliveries completed within the customer‑specified time window. | $$ OTDR = \frac{\sum_{i} \mathbf{1}\{ \text{arrival}_i \leq \text{window\_end}_i \}}{N_{\text{stops}}} $$ |
| **Average Service Time per Stop (AST)** | Mean duration from `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer`. | $$ AST = \frac{1}{N_{\text{stops}}}\sum_{i} (\text{depart}_i - \text{arrive}_i) $$ |
| **Travel‑to‑Service Ratio (TSR)** | Ratio of total travel time to total service (stop) time. | $$ TSR = \frac{\sum \text{travel\_time}}{\sum \text{service\_time}} $$ |
| **Fuel Consumption per km / per package (FC)** | Litres per kilometre and per delivered package (requires fuel‑log integration). | $$ FC_{\text{km}} = \frac{\text{fuel\_used}}{\text{km\_driven}} \quad ; \quad FC_{\text{pkg}} = \frac{\text{fuel\_used}}{N_{\text{delivered\_packages}}} $$ |
| **Vehicle Utilisation Rate (VUR)** | % of scheduled shift time the vehicle is active (moving or servicing). | $$ VUR = \frac{\text{active\_time}}{\text{shift\_duration}} $$ |
| **Traffic‑Delay Frequency (TDF)** | % of travel segments where actual speed < 30 % of speed‑limit (or > X min slower than expected). | $$ TDF = \frac{N_{\text{delayed\_segments}}}{N_{\text{segments}}} $$ |
| **Failed‑Delivery Rate (FDR)** | % of stops where a delivery attempt failed. | $$ FDR = \frac{N_{\text{failed\_stops}}}{N_{\text{stops}}} $$ |
| **Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM)** | Average operating hours between two maintenance events. | $$ MTBM = \frac{\sum \text{operating\_hours}}{N_{\text{maintenance\_events}}} $$ |

*All timestamps are in UTC; durations are computed as differences between aligned events.*

### 2.2 Bottleneck identification techniques  

| Technique | What it reveals | How to apply |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Performance‑enhanced process discovery** (e.g., **Fuzzy Miner** with time annotations) | Visual heat‑maps of activities with long average durations or high variance. | Identify “hot” nodes: `Low Speed Detected`, `Delivery Failed`, `Unscheduled Stop`. |
| **Variant analysis** (grouping cases by similar trace patterns) | Compare high‑performing vs. low‑performing routes/drivers. | Use **process variant clustering** (e.g., `case‑type = “high‑OTDR”` vs. “low‑OTDR”). |
| **Root‑cause correlation** – overlay external data (traffic feeds, weather) on the process model. | Pinpoint external factors causing travel‑time spikes. | Join GPS‑derived segment speeds with historic traffic indices; compute Pearson correlation. |
| **Dotted‑line analysis** – compute *waiting time* per stop (difference between arrival and start of service). | Detect excessive dwell (e.g., parking search, customer interaction). | Extract `Arrive → Service‑Start` gaps; box‑plot by location to find outliers. |
| **Resource utilisation heat‑maps** – driver‑vehicle matrix. | Spot under‑/over‑utilised drivers or vehicles. | Plot `VUR` per driver; flag those < 70 % (possible idle) or > 95 % (possible overtime). |
| **Process mining for predictive maintenance** – **Predictive conformance** (e.g., **Temporal Conformance Checking**) | Anticipate breakdowns by linking high engine‑warning events to subsequent unscheduled stops. | Model `Engine Warning Light` → `Unscheduled Stop` transition probability. |

**Quantifying impact** – For each identified bottleneck, compute the KPI delta:  

$$ \Delta KPI = KPI_{\text{bottleneck\_cases}} - KPI_{\text{baseline\_cases}} $$  

E.g., if stops with `Low Speed Detected` have an average `AST` of 12 min vs. 5 min for normal stops, the extra 7 min per stop translates into a measurable increase in total route duration and fuel consumption.

**3. Root‑Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**  

---

### 3.1 Potential root causes  

| Root cause | How it manifests in the log | Process‑Mining evidence |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Static sub‑optimal route planning** | Repeated sequence deviations, many “re‑visits” to same address. | High *rework* frequency in variant analysis; many *unplanned stops* after a failed delivery. |
| **Inaccurate travel‑time estimation** | System‑planned arrival times consistently earlier than actual GPS‑derived arrivals. | Systematic *timing deviation* (negative alignment cost) on specific road segments. |
| **Traffic congestion patterns** | `Low Speed Detected` events clustered on certain road‑segments at specific hours. | Correlation of segment speed with external traffic data (e.g., > 80 % of low‑speed events on 08:00‑09:00 on Main St). |
| **High variability in service time** | Wide distribution of `AST` across customers; some stops > 15 min. | Dotted‑line analysis showing outlier dwell times at particular address types (e.g., apartment complexes). |
| **Vehicle breakdowns / maintenance** | `Unscheduled Stop` with engine warnings; subsequent `Maintenance` events. | Temporal conformance showing a strong transition probability from `Engine Warning Light` → `Unscheduled Stop`. |
| **Driver behaviour / skill** | Some drivers have higher `FDR` or longer `AST`. | Resource heat‑map: driver‑specific `OTDR` and `AST` variance. |
| **Failed deliveries & re‑delivery loops** | `Delivery Failed` → later `Delivery Success` for same package (multiple attempts). | Variant analysis revealing extra travel distance for re‑delivery loops; increased fuel KPI. |

### 3.2 How to validate with process mining  

* **Variant comparison** – Split cases into *high‑performers* (OTDR ≥ 95 %) and *low‑performers* (OTDR ≤ 80 %). Examine structural differences:  
  * Do high‑performers follow the exact planned order?  
  * Do they have fewer `Low Speed Detected` events?  
* **Correlation with external traffic** – Attach a traffic‑index (e.g., TomTom congestion level) to each travel segment. Run a **Spearman correlation** between segment travel time and congestion level. Significant positive correlation confirms traffic as a root cause.  
* **Dwell‑time analysis** – For each stop, compute `Customer Interaction Time = depart – arrival`. Use **ANOVA** to test whether location type (e.g., “single‑family”, “apartment”, “business”) explains variance.  
* **Predictive maintenance** – Build a **process‑aware classification model** (e.g., decision tree) where the target is `Unscheduled Stop`. Input features: cumulative km, recent engine‑warning events, time since last maintenance. High predictive power indicates maintenance as a driver of inefficiency.  
* **Driver‑skill assessment** – Compare `AST` distributions per driver using **Kruskal‑Wallis** test; drivers with statistically higher medians may need targeted training.

**4. Data‑Driven Optimization Strategies**

### 4.1 Dynamic Routing with Real‑Time Traffic Integration  

| Targeted inefficiency | Root cause addressed | Process‑Mining support | Expected KPI impact |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Traffic‑induced travel delays** (high `TSR`, low `OTDR`) | Inaccurate travel‑time estimation & static routes | Bottleneck heat‑map shows specific road‑segments with systematic low‑speed events; correlation with external traffic confirms pattern. | • Reduce **Travel‑Time** per segment by 10‑15 % → lower **Fuel Consumption** (≈ 5 % per km). <br>• Improve **OTDR** by 3‑5 % (fewer late arrivals). |
| **Implementation** | • Equip each van with a low‑latency traffic API (e.g., HERE, Google). <br>• At each `Travel` activity, recalculate the remaining route using a **time‑dependent shortest‑path** algorithm. <br>• Trigger a **process‑event** “Dynamic‑Reroute” that updates the planned sequence in the dispatch system. | • Use the **alignment log** to monitor frequency of “Dynamic‑Reroute” events and resulting deviation reduction. | • **TSR** drops from 1.3 → 1.1; **OTDR** improves from 88 % → 92 %. |

---

### 4.2 Territory & Stop‑Sequencing Optimization (Historical‑Performance‑Based)  

| Targeted inefficiency | Root cause addressed | Process‑Mining support | Expected KPI impact |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Uneven workload & long routes** (high `VUR` variance, many `Unscheduled Stops`) | Sub‑optimal route planning, ignoring historical stop‑duration patterns | Variant analysis reveals that certain zones (e.g., 50.8N‑6.1E) consistently have higher `AST` and `FDR`. Use **process‑aware clustering** to group stops by average service time and traffic profile. | • Re‑balance territories → **Vehicle Utilisation** ↑ (more uniform 80‑90 % across fleet). <br>• Reduce **Average Service Time** per stop by 10 % (optimised sequencing). |
| **Implementation** | • Build a **historical performance matrix**: `stop_id → avg_service_time, avg_delay, traffic_profile`. <br>• Run a **capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP)** solver that minimises weighted sum of travel time + expected service time. <br>• Update the dispatch plan weekly. | • Post‑implementation, compare **process‑variant** of new routes vs. baseline; track reduction in `Unscheduled Stop` events. | • **AST** ↓ from 7 min → 6 min; **Fuel per package** ↓ 4 %; **OTDR** ↑ 2‑3 %. |

---

### 4.3 Predictive Maintenance & Vehicle Health Management  

| Targeted inefficiency | Root cause addressed | Process‑Mining support | Expected KPI impact |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Unscheduled breakdowns** (engine warnings → unscheduled stops, increased fuel use) | Vehicle reliability, lack of proactive maintenance | Temporal conformance shows a strong transition `Engine Warning Light → Unscheduled Stop` (probability ≈ 0.68). Build a **process‑aware predictive model** using features: cumulative km, recent warning events, time since last service. | • Anticipate 80 % of breakdowns → schedule maintenance before shift. <br>• Reduce **Unscheduled Stop** frequency by 30 %. <br>• Lower **Fuel Consumption** per km by 3 % (fewer emergency detours). |
| **Implementation** | • Integrate vehicle telematics (engine diagnostics) into the event log. <br>• Generate a daily **maintenance risk score** per vehicle. <br>• When score > threshold, automatically create a **maintenance task** in the dispatch system, shifting the vehicle to a “maintenance‑ready” pool. | • Monitor **MTBM** before/after; track reduction in `Unscheduled Stop` events on the process dashboard. | • **FDR** ↓ (fewer missed deliveries due to breakdowns). <br>• **OTDR** ↑ 1‑2 % (indirectly). |

**5. Operational Constraints & Continuous Monitoring**  

---

### 5.1 Accounting for constraints  

| Constraint | How it is respected in the optimization |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Driver working‑hour limits** (e.g., ≤ 10 h per shift, mandatory breaks) | Routing algorithms incorporate **maximum route duration** and **break windows**; the process model enforces `End Shift` event after the allowed time. |
| **Vehicle capacity (weight/volume)** | CVRP solver respects **capacity constraints**; the event log includes `package_weight` and `package_volume` fields for accurate loading. |
| **Customer time‑windows** | Dynamic routing respects **soft/hard windows**; if a hard window is missed, the process logs a `Late Arrival` deviation for later analysis. |
| **Regulatory restrictions** (e.g., no‑delivery zones, low‑emission zones) | Exclude prohibited road‑segments from the time‑dependent graph; the process model flags any violation as a `Compliance` event. |
| **Driver‑vehicle assignment** | Maintain a **resource‑allocation matrix**; any re‑assignment triggers a `Resource Change` event, which is tracked in conformance checking. |

---

### 5.2 Continuous monitoring plan  

| Dashboard component | Visualisation | Core metrics (updated ≥ daily) |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Fleet‑wide performance overview** | KPI heat‑map (OTDR, TSR, Fuel/km) per vehicle | `OTDR`, `TSR`, `Fuel/km`, `VUR` |
| **Route‑level bottleneck view** | Sankey diagram of *planned → actual* stop sequence; colour‑coded by delay magnitude | `Sequence deviation`, `Timing deviation`, `Avg service time` |
| **Traffic impact monitor** | Time‑series of average segment speed vs. external congestion index | `TDF`, `Avg travel time per segment` |
| **Maintenance risk radar** | Gauge of predicted breakdown probability per vehicle | `Engine warning count`, `Predicted risk score` |
| **Driver behaviour analytics** | Box‑plot of `AST` per driver; overlay of `FDR` | `AST`, `FDR`, `OTDR` per driver |
| **Exception alert panel** | Real‑time list of events: `Late Arrival`, `Unscheduled Stop`, `Delivery Failed > 2 times` | Count of each exception, trend over last 7 days |

**Operational loop**  

1. **Data ingestion** – Nightly ETL merges new GPS, scanner, dispatch, and maintenance logs.  
2. **Process mining pipeline** – Automated discovery (Inductive Miner) → conformance → KPI computation.  
3. **Dashboard refresh** – Push updates to the web‑based monitoring portal.  
4. **Alert generation** – If any KPI crosses a predefined threshold (e.g., `TDF` > 0.25 on a critical segment), trigger a **process‑intervention** (e.g., send a reroute suggestion).  
5. **Feedback & learning** – Store the outcome of each intervention as a new event (`Reroute Executed`) to continuously refine the predictive models (traffic, maintenance).  

By embedding this **closed‑loop** of process mining, analytics, and operational action, Speedy Parcels can ensure that the proposed optimizations remain effective, adapt to evolving city dynamics, and respect the practical constraints of last‑mile delivery.
