Based on the global supply chain scenario for high-tech electronics, the following Python dictionary represents the temporal profile. The times are estimated in seconds, reflecting realistic durations for international procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer support cycles.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct and near-direct connections
    ('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 86400),        # 3 days avg, 1 day stdev (Selection to Order)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 345600),     # 14 days avg, 4 days stdev (Global lead time)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200),        # 1 day avg, 0.5 day stdev (Receiving to Inspection)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (129600, 43200),       # 1.5 days avg, 0.5 day stdev (Inspection to Assembly line)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),       # 3 days avg, 1 day stdev (Assembly duration)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 14400),        # 12 hours avg, 4 hours stdev (Testing to Packaging)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (21600, 7200),         # 6 hours avg, 2 hours stdev (Packaging to Warehouse)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (432000, 172800),      # 5 days avg, 2 days stdev (Storage until dispatch)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 1209600),    # 30 days avg, 14 days stdev (Shipping to first support)

    # Long-range dependencies (Multi-step separations)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1468800, 432000),     # ~17 days (Procurement cycle)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (1296000, 388800),     # ~15 days (Order to ready-for-production)
    ('RC', 'CA'): (216000, 86400),       # 2.5 days (Inbound processing)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (388800, 129600),      # 4.5 days (Production throughput)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (302400, 100800),      # 3.5 days (Work-in-progress to finished good)
    ('PT', 'WS'): (64800, 21600),        # 18 hours (Quality control to inventory)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (453600, 180000),      # ~5.25 days (Post-production to shipping)
    ('WS', 'AS'): (3024000, 1296000),    # ~35 days (Inventory to post-sale lifecycle)
    
    # End-to-end process profile
    ('SS', 'AS'): (5011200, 1555200)     # ~58 days (Full process lifecycle)
}
```

### Rationale for Estimates:
1.  **Procurement (SS to RC):** These pairs involve high average times and high standard deviations due to global shipping variables, customs, and supplier reliability.
2.  **Manufacturing (QI to PK):** These are internal processes. They have relatively lower standard deviations as they occur in a controlled factory environment.
3.  **Logistics (WS to DT):** The delay here represents the "buffer" where the product waits for a shipping vessel or truck, which can vary significantly based on the distribution schedule.
4.  **After-Sales (DT to AS):** This is the longest gap, as it represents the time from shipping until a customer actually requires technical support or maintenance.
