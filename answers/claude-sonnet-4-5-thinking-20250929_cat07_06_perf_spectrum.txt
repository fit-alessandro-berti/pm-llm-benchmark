# Visualization Description

This is a **temporal flow diagram** (similar to a Sankey diagram) showing the progression of a fine processing system over approximately 13 years (2000-2013). 

## Key Components:

**Three Process Stages (horizontal levels):**
1. **Send Fine** (top) - Initial fine issuance
2. **Insert Fine Notification** (middle) - Formal notification step
3. **Send for Credit Collection** (bottom) - Debt collection escalation

**Visual Elements:**

- **Vertical gray bars** at the top represent the volume/frequency of fines sent over time
- **Gray flowing lines** connect the top two stages, showing the transition from sending fines to inserting notifications
- **Red/pink flowing lines** connect the middle to bottom stages, indicating cases escalated to credit collection

**Key Observations:**

- The gray flows are much denser than the red flows, suggesting most fines proceed to notification but relatively fewer reach debt collection
- The varying line thickness and density indicate fluctuations in volume over time
- The time axis shows distinct periods of activity with some apparent gaps or reduced activity
- This appears to be analyzing a business process workflow, possibly for traffic fines, parking violations, or similar penalty systems

The visualization effectively illustrates both the volume of cases at each stage and the flow patterns between stages over an extended time period.
