Below is a Python dictionary representing the **Log Skeleton** for the order fulfillment process in the distribution center, incorporating all the specified constraints:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RI', 'CA'),  # Reserving items is equivalent to checking availability (if CA occurs, RI must occur, and vice versa)
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Picking items is equivalent to quality checking (if QC occurs, PI must occur, and vice versa)
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Packing order is equivalent to generating a shipping label (if GSL occurs, PO must occur, and vice versa)
    },

    'always_before': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),   # Receive Order must occur before Check Availability
        ('RO', 'RI'),   # Receive Order must occur before Reserve Items
        ('CA', 'RI'),   # Check Availability must occur before Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),   # Reserve Items must occur before Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),   # Pick Items must occur before Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),   # Quality Check must occur before Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # Pack Order must occur before Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),   # Generate Shipping Label must occur before Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),    # Dispatch must occur before Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP'),   # Invoice Customer must occur before Record Payment
    },

    'always_after': {
        ('RI', {'RI', 'PI', 'QC'}),  # After Reserve Items, either RI, PI, or QC must occur (but this is redundant with 'always_before')
        ('PI', {'PI', 'QC', 'PO'}),  # After Pick Items, either PI, QC, or PO must occur (redundant)
        ('QC', {'QC', 'PO', 'GSL'}), # After Quality Check, either QC, PO, or GSL must occur (redundant)
        ('PO', {'PO', 'GSL', 'D'}),  # After Pack Order, either PO, GSL, or D must occur (redundant)
        ('GSL', {'GSL', 'D', 'IC'}), # After Generate Shipping Label, either GSL, D, or IC must occur (redundant)
        ('D', {'D', 'IC', 'RP'}),    # After Dispatch, either D, IC, or RP must occur (redundant)
    },

    'never_together': {
        ('RI', 'PI'),   # Reserve Items and Pick Items cannot occur together (RI must be followed by PI)
        ('PI', 'QC'),   # Pick Items and Quality Check cannot occur together (PI must be followed by QC)
        ('QC', 'PO'),   # Quality Check and Pack Order cannot occur together (QC must be followed by PO)
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # Pack Order and Generate Shipping Label cannot occur together (PO must be followed by GSL)
        ('GSL', 'D'),   # Generate Shipping Label and Dispatch cannot occur together (GSL must be followed by D)
        ('D', 'IC'),    # Dispatch and Invoice Customer cannot occur together (D must be followed by IC)
        ('IC', 'RP'),   # Invoice Customer and Record Payment cannot occur together (IC must be followed by RP)
    },

    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {0, 1},   # Receive Order occurs either 0 or 1 time (only once per order)
        'CA': {0, 1},   # Check Availability occurs either 0 or 1 time (if not, RI is skipped)
        'RI': {0, 1},   # Reserve Items occurs either 0 or 1 time (if not, PI is skipped)
        'PI': {0, 1},   # Pick Items occurs either 0 or 1 time (if not, QC is skipped)
        'QC': {0, 1},   # Quality Check occurs either 0 or 1 time (if not, PO is skipped)
        'PO': {0, 1},   # Pack Order occurs either 0 or 1 time (if not, GSL is skipped)
        'GSL': {0, 1},  # Generate Shipping Label occurs either 0 or 1 time (if not, D is skipped)
        'D': {0, 1},    # Dispatch occurs either 0 or 1 time (if not, IC is skipped)
        'IC': {0, 1},   # Invoice Customer occurs either 0 or 1 time (if not, RP is skipped)
        'RP': {0, 1},   # Record Payment occurs either 0 or 1 time (if not, the order is incomplete)
    },

    'directly_follows': {
        ('RI', 'PI'),   # Reserve Items must be directly followed by Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),   # Pick Items must be directly followed by Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),   # Quality Check must be directly followed by Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # Pack Order must be directly followed by Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),   # Generate Shipping Label must be directly followed by Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),    # Dispatch must be directly followed by Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP'),   # Invoice Customer must be directly followed by Record Payment
    }
}
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Equivalence Constraints** (`'equivalence'`) are used where activities are logically interchangeable (e.g., `RI` and `CA` are related, but not identical).
2. **Always Before** (`'always_before'`) enforces strict ordering (e.g., `RO` must precede `CA`).
3. **Never Together** (`'never_together'`) ensures no two activities can occur simultaneously (e.g., `RI` and `PI` cannot overlap).
4. **Directly-Follows** (`'directly_follows'`) enforces immediate succession (e.g., `RI` must be immediately followed by `PI`).
5. **Activity Occurrences** (`'activ_freq'`) limits each activity to 0 or 1 occurrence per case (unless modified for batch processing).

### Notes:
- Some constraints (e.g., `always_after`) are redundant with `always_before` and `directly_follows` but are included for completeness.
- If the process allows for parallel or batch operations (e.g., multiple `RI`/`PI` pairs), the frequency constraints would need adjustment (e.g., `{'RI': {1, 2}}`).
