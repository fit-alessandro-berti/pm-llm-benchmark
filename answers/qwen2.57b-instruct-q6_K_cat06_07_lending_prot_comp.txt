To identify unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, we need to focus on both the process variants that lead to different outcomes (e.g., loan denial or approval) and the execution times associated with these processes. Here are some key observations:

### 1. **Loan Denial Outcomes:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The main outcome leading to loan denial is "Request Co-Signer On Loan" followed by various assessments, culminating in a final decision.
  - This pathway is less common but has significantly longer processing times.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Most cases of loan denial follow the path where borrowers submit their files directly to underwriters, which are then rejected without further steps. These pathways are more frequent and have relatively shorter execution times.
  
### 2. **Process Variants Analysis:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Common paths include "Request Co-Signer On Loan" followed by multiple assessments (e.g., making visits to assess collateral, requesting a co-signer), which often result in loan denial after significant delays.
  - Examples:
    - `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied`
    - This variant involves more steps and longer processing times (350,001.817 ms).

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Common paths are straightforward with direct submission of files to underwriters, leading either to loan denial or approval.
  - Examples:
    - `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied`
    - This variant is more common and has shorter processing times (340,005.309 ms).

### 3. **Execution Time Analysis:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The execution time for loan denial paths in the protected group can be significantly higher due to multiple additional steps.
  - For instance, some variants take over 360,000 milliseconds.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Most of the loan denial pathways are much faster, with typical times around 340,000 to 390,000 milliseconds. This suggests a more streamlined process for those who get denied.

### 4. **Frequency Analysis:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The frequency is lower but the processing time is longer.
  - There are only a few common paths (like `Appointment Denied` and `Application Rejected`) that account for most of their total cases, leading to shorter execution times overall.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Higher frequency with faster execution times. The majority of loan denials follow simple pathways without additional steps, suggesting fewer delays in the process.

### Conclusion:
The main differences can be summarized as follows:

1. **Process Complexity and Time:**
   - The protected group experiences a more complex and time-consuming process leading to loan denial (e.g., multiple assessments, co-signer requirements).
   - The unprotected group generally has simpler processes with fewer steps, resulting in faster decision-making times.

2. **Frequency of Outcomes:**
   - The protected group has fewer but longer pathways that lead to loan denial.
   - The unprotected group has more frequent but shorter pathways leading to similar outcomes.

These differences suggest potential biases or systemic issues where the process for the 'protected' group is unnecessarily prolonged and complex, which could contribute to higher levels of perceived unfairness.
