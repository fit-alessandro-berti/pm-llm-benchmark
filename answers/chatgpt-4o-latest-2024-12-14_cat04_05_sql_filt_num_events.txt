Hereâ€™s a possible SQL query to fulfill the task described:

```sql
WITH event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM
        event_counts
    WHERE
        event_count <= 6
)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    event_log
WHERE
    case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);
```

### Explanation:
1. **`event_counts` CTE**:
   - Calculates the number of events (`COUNT(*)`) per `case_id`.
   - Groups events by `case_id` to get a count of events per case.

2. **`filtered_cases` CTE**:
   - Filters for `case_id` values where the event count is **6 or fewer** (`event_count <= 6`).

3. **Final Query**:
   - Selects all rows from the original `event_log` table.
   - Ensures only rows where `case_id` exists in the `filtered_cases` result are included.

This approach is efficient and clear, leveraging DuckDB's SQL capabilities for filtering and subquery handling.
