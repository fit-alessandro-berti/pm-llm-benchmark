Here’s how the event log compares to the intended process.

### Normative model (as interpreted)

Two ideal paths:

1. **Fulfillment (inventory sufficient)**  
   `Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`

2. **Cancellation (inventory insufficient)**  
   `Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`

Key rules derived from the description:

- R1. **Start**: The first activity must be **Receive order**.  
- R2. **Check first**: **Check inventory** must happen after Receive and **before** any payment or fulfillment steps.  
- R3. **Authorize timing**: **Authorize payment** only after **Check inventory**, and **before** **Package items**.  
- R4. **Package timing**: **Package items** only after **Authorize payment** and before **Ship order**.  
- R5. **Ship timing**: **Ship order** only after **Package items**, and **never after** **Cancel order**.  
- R6. **Cancel path**: If canceled, the logical path is `Receive  Check  Cancel  Close` with **no fulfillment activities (authorize, package, ship)** afterward.  
- R7. **Close last**: **Close order** must be the final activity in the case.

### Case-by-case assessment

#### Case 1
`Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close`

- Follows the fulfillment path exactly.
- All ordering constraints (R1–R7) satisfied.

 **Case 1 conforms to the normative process.**

---

#### Case 2
`Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close`

Violations:

- **Package before authorization**:  
  - Breaks R3 and R4: *“Authorize payment should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging”* and *“Package items should only occur after authorization”*.  
  - Here, **Package items** occurs **before** **Authorize payment**.
- **Authorize after packaging**:  
  - Also violates R3: authorization happens, but not in the intended position (it comes after packaging).

 R1, R2, R5, R7 are OK, but the payment/packaging ordering is wrong.

 **Case 2 violates the normative process (misordered Authorize / Package).**

---

#### Case 3
`Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close`

Clear violation:

- **Shipping after cancellation**:  
  - Violates R5 and R6: *“Ship order should ... never [occur] after a cancellation”* and, more broadly, no fulfillment after cancel.  
  - Here, **Ship order** occurs **after** **Cancel order**.

Likely additional deviation (by intended branching):

- The described cancellation path is `Receive  Check  Cancel  Close` (no authorization mentioned).  
  - The log has **Authorize payment** before **Cancel order**, which is not part of the described “insufficient inventory” scenario. It contradicts the idea that, when inventory is insufficient, the process **should directly proceed to "Cancel order"** after the check.  
  - This is somewhat ambiguous in real life (you could authorize then later cancel/refund), but it **deviates from the normative cancellation sequence as stated**.

 **Case 3 violates the normative process, primarily because it ships after cancellation; it also deviates from the described cancel path by authorizing payment before cancel.**

---

#### Case 4
`Receive  Check  Cancel  Close`

- Exactly matches the described cancellation path.  
- No payment, packaging, or shipping after cancel (R6 satisfied).  
- Close is last (R7).

 **Case 4 conforms to the normative process.**

---

#### Case 5
`Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close`

Violations:

- **Missing packaging before shipping**:  
  - Violates R4 and R5: *“Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping”* and *“Ship order should only occur after packaging”*.  
  - Here, there is **no** **Package items** step at all, and **Ship order** happens immediately after **Authorize payment**.
- Interpreting the fulfillment path, this case skips a required activity in the sufficient-inventory scenario (`Package items`).

 **Case 5 violates the normative process by shipping without packaging.**

---

### Summary

- **Conforming cases:**  
  - **Case 1**, **Case 4**

- **Non-conforming cases and reasons:**  
  - **Case 2**: Packaged before payment authorization; authorization occurs after packaging instead of before.  
  - **Case 3**: Shipment occurs after cancellation (explicitly forbidden); also deviates from the intended cancel sequence by authorizing payment before cancel.  
  - **Case 5**: Shipped without a prior packaging step; violates the requirement that shipping only occurs after packaging.
