It’s a BPMN swimlane diagram of a “Ship goods” process.

- Lanes: Logistics (top), Dispatch of goods/Secretary (middle), Warehouse (bottom).
- Start: Ship goods. A parallel gateway splits the work.

Middle lane (admin/dispatch):
- Clarify shipment method (uses Order details).
- Decision “Special handling?”
  - Yes: Get three offers from logistics companies  Select a logistics company and place the order.
  - No: Check if insurance is required (uses Customer information)  If needed, insure parcel (in the Logistics lane).
- Write package label (always).
- The admin paths merge.

Bottom lane (warehouse):
- Package goods. A 48hour boundary timer can trigger “Notify customer about delay.”

Synchronization and finish:
- After packaging and the admin path are both complete (parallel join), fill out shipment paperwork  Move package to pickup area  End: Shipment prepared.

Diagram features include parallel and exclusive gateways, data objects/stores, and a timer boundary event.
