## Precision Parts Inc. - Data-Driven Scheduling Optimization

Here's a comprehensive approach to optimizing scheduling at Precision Parts Inc., leveraging process mining and advanced scheduling strategies.

**1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics:**

We're leveraging the MES event logs to reconstruct the shop floor's operational reality. The core process mining technique will be **process discovery**, which automatically builds a process model from the event data, revealing the actual flow of jobs and task sequences. This goes beyond the planned schedule and shows what *actually* happened.

*   **Metrics & Techniques:**
    *   **Job Flow Time, Lead Time, Makespan Distributions:** Process mining tools can calculate these directly from timestamps. We're looking for percentiles (e.g., 90th percentile lead time) to understand variability.
    *   **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):** Calculated as the difference between task release time (queue entry) and task start time.  We're looking for bottlenecks – machines with consistently high queue times.
    *   **Resource Utilization:**  Calculated as the ratio of productive time (task execution + setup) to total available time.  We're looking for underutilized resources (potential for reallocation) and overloaded resources (bottlenecks).
    *   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** This is crucial. We'll use **variant analysis** to identify common job sequences on each machine. For each sequence, we'll calculate the average setup time.  We'll then build a *setup time matrix* for each machine, mapping job sequence pairs to average setup duration. This matrix will be a key input for scheduling.
    *   **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness:**  We'll calculate the difference between the actual completion time and the due date for each job.  We'll then analyze the distribution of tardiness, identifying the frequency and magnitude of delays.  **Conformance checking** will compare the actual process flow against the planned process flow (if available) to quantify deviations.
    *   **Impact of Disruptions:** We'll filter the event log to isolate events related to breakdowns and priority changes. We'll then analyze the impact of these events on job flow times, queue lengths, and resource utilization.

**2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies:**

Based on the performance analysis, we're likely to find the following pathologies:

*   **Bottleneck Resources:**  CUT-01 and MILL-03 are likely bottlenecks, evidenced by consistently high queue times and low utilization of downstream resources.
*   **Poor Task Prioritization:** High-priority jobs are frequently delayed due to the current dispatching rules, which may not adequately consider due dates or downstream machine load.
*   **Suboptimal Sequencing:**  High setup times due to poor job sequencing on bottleneck machines, particularly those with significant sequence-dependent setup times.
*   **Starvation:** Downstream resources (e.g., Quality Inspection) may be starved due to upstream bottlenecks, leading to increased WIP.
*   **Bullwhip Effect:** Variability in task durations and machine availability can amplify WIP levels, creating a bullwhip effect.

**Evidence from Process Mining:**

*   **Bottleneck Analysis:**  Queue time distributions for CUT-01 and MILL-03 will show significantly higher variance and longer average queue times compared to other machines.
*   **Variant Analysis (On-Time vs. Late Jobs):** Comparing the process flows of on-time and late jobs will reveal common patterns leading to delays.  For example, late jobs might consistently experience long queues at CUT-01.
*   **Resource Contention Periods:**  Identifying periods of high resource contention (multiple jobs competing for the same machine) will highlight potential scheduling conflicts.
*   **Setup Time Matrix Analysis:** The setup time matrix will reveal specific job sequences that lead to significantly longer setup times.

**3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness:**

*   **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:** The current rules are likely too simplistic to handle the complexity of the shop floor. They don't dynamically adjust to changing conditions (machine availability, queue lengths, job priorities).
*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** The current system likely lacks real-time visibility into shop floor status, making it difficult to proactively identify and address potential problems.
*   **Inaccurate Task Duration/Setup Time Estimations:**  The current system may rely on inaccurate or outdated task duration/setup time estimations, leading to unrealistic schedules.
*   **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:** The current system likely doesn't explicitly consider sequence-dependent setup times when scheduling jobs.
*   **Poor Coordination:** Lack of coordination between work centers can lead to inefficient job routing and increased WIP.
*   **Inadequate Response to Disruptions:** The current system may lack automated mechanisms for responding to unplanned breakdowns or urgent orders.

**Differentiating Issues:**

Process mining can help differentiate between issues caused by poor scheduling logic versus resource capacity limitations. For example, if a machine consistently has long queue times *regardless* of the scheduling rule, it suggests a capacity limitation. If queue times vary significantly depending on the scheduling rule, it suggests a scheduling problem.

**4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies:**

*   **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules (Dynamic Priority-Based Dispatching):**
    *   **Logic:**  Jobs are dispatched based on a weighted combination of factors: Remaining Processing Time (RPT), Due Date, Priority, and *Estimated Sequence-Dependent Setup Time*.
    *   **Process Mining Input:** The setup time matrix is used to estimate the setup time for each potential job sequence.  Historical task duration distributions are used to estimate RPT.
    *   **Pathology Addressed:** Poor prioritization, suboptimal sequencing, and inefficient resource utilization.
    *   **Expected Impact:** Reduced tardiness, improved resource utilization, and reduced WIP.
*   **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling (Machine Learning-Based Duration Prediction):**
    *   **Logic:**  Uses machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on historical task duration data to predict task durations more accurately.  These predictions are used to generate more realistic schedules.
    *   **Process Mining Input:** Historical task duration data, including operator ID, job complexity, and machine ID.
    *   **Pathology Addressed:** Inaccurate task duration estimations, leading to unrealistic schedules.
    *   **Expected Impact:** Reduced tardiness, improved resource utilization, and reduced WIP.
*   **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization (Batching & Sequencing):**
    *   **Logic:**  Groups similar jobs together into batches to minimize sequence-dependent setup times.  Sequences jobs within batches to minimize total setup time, using the setup time matrix.
    *   **Process Mining Input:** The setup time matrix is used to identify optimal job sequences within batches.
    *   **Pathology Addressed:** Suboptimal sequencing, leading to high setup times.
    *   **Expected Impact:** Reduced setup times, improved throughput, and reduced WIP.

**5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement:**

*   **Discrete-Event Simulation:** We'll use a simulation tool (e.g., AnyLogic, Arena) to model the shop floor. The simulation will be parameterized with data derived from process mining: task time distributions, routing probabilities, breakdown frequencies, and the setup time matrix.
*   **Scenarios:** We'll test scenarios including high load, frequent breakdowns, and urgent orders. We'll compare the performance of the proposed scheduling strategies against the baseline and against each other.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** We'll continuously monitor KPIs (tardiness, WIP, lead time, utilization) using process mining. We'll use statistical process control (SPC) charts to detect drifts or new inefficiencies. Automated alerts will trigger investigations and adjustments to the scheduling logic.  We'll retrain the machine learning models periodically to ensure accuracy.
