Here is the **updated `declare_model`** with new constraints that mitigate bias in the loan application process. These constraints ensure that sensitive attributes (e.g., `ApplicantRace`, `ApplicantGender`, `ApplicantAge`) do not directly influence the decision-making process without proper checks, and that fairness mechanisms (e.g., `ManualReview`, `BiasMitigationCheck`) are enforced in the workflow.

###  **Explanation of Added Constraints**

1. **`existence` Updates:**
   - Added activities like `ManualReview`, `BiasMitigationCheck`, and `CheckApplicantRace`, etc., to the model to ensure they are recognized and can be used in constraints.

2. **`coexistence` Constraints:**
   - `"Approve": {"ManualReview": ...}` and `"Reject": {"ManualReview": ...}` ensure that whenever a final decision is made (Approve or Reject), a `ManualReview` activity must also be present in the trace. This ensures that decisions are not made in isolation and are subject to human review, especially for sensitive demographics.

3. **`response` Constraints:**
   - `"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": ...}` ensures that any activity that reveals a sensitive attribute (like checking race) must be followed by a `BiasMitigationCheck`, which could be a review or audit to prevent biased decisions.

4. **`succession` Constraints:**
   - `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": ...}` and `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": ...}` ensure that only after a bias check can a final decision be made, enforcing a fairness check before any sensitive decision is finalized.

5. **`noncoexistence` and `nonsuccession` Constraints:**
   - `"CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": ...}` and similar for gender and age ensure that a `Reject` decision cannot coexist with or directly follow a sensitive attribute check. This prevents a decision from being made immediately after a sensitive attribute is revealed, reducing the risk of bias.

###  **Summary of Bias Mitigation**

These added constraints reduce the risk of bias in the loan application process by:
- Enforcing **manual review** before final decisions.
- **Forcing fairness checks** (e.g., `BiasMitigationCheck`) after sensitive attribute checks.
- Preventing **immediate decisions** (e.g., `Reject`) after sensitive data is accessed.
- Ensuring **fairness mechanisms** are always involved in the decision-making path, especially for sensitive applicant groups.

This promotes **transparency, accountability, and fairness** in the automated or semi-automated loan review process.
