Which log is biased?  
The bias is in the Group B (Un-protected-group) log, and it operates to the disadvantage of the applicants in Group A (the protected group).

How the bias shows up:

1. ScoreAdjustment is applied only in Group B.  
   • For every Group B case that lists a CommunityGroup (“Highland Civic Darts Club”) the Scoring Engine adds “+10 (Community Boost)”.  
   • No case in Group A ever receives a positive adjustment, even when the base (Preliminary) scores are identical.

2. The two attributes that trigger the boost—LocalResident = TRUE and a non-null CommunityGroup—are present only in Group B.  
   • All Group A cases have LocalResident = FALSE and CommunityGroup = None, so they are structurally barred from any upward adjustment.  
   • Because community membership is strongly correlated with LocalResident, the rule functions as a proxy for group membership: it systematically advantages the un-protected group.

3. Effect on final decisions.  
   • Borderline example:  
     – P002 (protected): Preliminary 710, no boost  Final 710  Rejected.  
     – U003 (un-protected): Preliminary 695, +10 boost  Final 705  Approved.  
     The boost flips U003 from a score that would have been rejected (and was for P002) to one that is approved.  
   • U001 and P001 begin at the same base score (720). U001 still receives a +10 bump, yet P001 never does. The extra points do not change the outcome for U001 but widen the margin of approval, illustrating systematic preference even when it is not strictly needed.

4. Process-level asymmetry.  
   • Both groups pass through the same sequence of activities, and the Resources (Automated Sys, Checker, Scoring Engine, Underwriter, Rules Engine) are identical.  
   • The only functional difference is the presence, in Group B, of a rule inside the Scoring Engine that looks for LocalResident=TRUE and/or a specific CommunityGroup and awards an automatic boost.  
   • Because the protected-group applicants can never satisfy those conditions, the rule institutionalises disparate treatment.

Why this is problematic:

• Direct versus indirect discrimination. The system is not adding points based on an explicitly prohibited attribute (e.g., race), but it is relying on attributes (LocalResident, CommunityGroup) that correlate perfectly with group membership in this sample. That is a textbook form of indirect or proxy discrimination.  

• Disparate impact. The rule systematically increases approval probability for the un-protected group and never for the protected group, even when their underlying credit-worthiness (PreliminaryScore) is the same or better.

• Fair-lending or equal-treatment standards would require either (a) removing the community boost, or (b) making sure an equivalent, group-neutral factor is applied symmetrically.

In short, the Group B log exhibits preferential scoring through a “Community Boost” that is unavailable to the protected group, creating a consistent, explainable, and unjustified advantage for un-protected applicants.
