Based on the normative process description and the provided event log, we will analyze each case to determine whether it adheres to the intended workflow. The normative process defines two valid paths:

###  Valid Paths (as per normative description):

1. **Full Fulfillment Path** (inventory sufficient):  
   `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Package items`  `Ship order`  `Close order`

2. **Cancellation Path** (inventory insufficient):  
   `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Cancel order`  `Close order`

###  Forbidden Violations (explicitly stated or logically implied):

- `Authorize payment` before `Check inventory`  **Invalid** (payment authorization must be based on inventory availability).
- `Package items` before `Authorize payment`  **Invalid** (items should not be packaged until payment is confirmed).
- `Ship order` before `Package items`  **Invalid** (items must be packaged before shipping).
- `Ship order` after `Cancel order`  **Invalid** (shipping after cancellation is illogical and contradictory).
- `Close order` not as final activity  **Invalid** (must always be last).
- Any activity occurring after `Cancel order` except `Close order`  **Invalid**.

###  Case-by-Case Analysis:

#### **Case 1:**
```
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order
```
 **Perfect match** with the Full Fulfillment Path.  
 **No violation.**

---

#### **Case 2:**
```
Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
```
 **Violation**: `Package items` occurs **before** `Authorize payment`.

- According to the normative description:  
  > "Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped — **but only after payment is authorized**.

- Packaging before payment authorization risks expending resources on items that may never be paid for. This violates the logical dependency: **payment must be confirmed before commitment to packaging**.

 **Violation: Package items before Authorize payment**

---

#### **Case 3:**
```
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order
```
 **Two severe violations**:

1. **`Cancel order` after `Authorize payment`**:  
   - The normative process states that if inventory is insufficient, the process **must** proceed to `Cancel order` immediately after `Check inventory`.  
   - Here, payment was authorized *before* cancellation — meaning the system authorized payment even though the order was later canceled. This is logically inconsistent and financially risky.  
   - The description implies that cancellation is a direct consequence of insufficient inventory, and **no fulfillment activities should follow**. Authorizing payment after discovering insufficient inventory is a clear deviation.

2. **`Ship order` after `Cancel order`**:  
   - Explicitly forbidden:  
     > "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)"  
   - Shipping a canceled order is a critical violation of process integrity.

 **Violations**:  
- Authorize payment after Check inventory but before Cancel order (illogical sequence)  
- Ship order after Cancel order (explicitly prohibited)

---

#### **Case 4:**
```
Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order
```
 **Perfect match** with the Cancellation Path.  
 **No violation.**

---

#### **Case 5:**
```
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
```
 **Violation**: `Ship order` occurs **directly after** `Authorize payment`, with **no `Package items`** in between.

- The normative description explicitly states:  
  > "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'"

- Skipping `Package items` implies items were shipped without being prepared — which is operationally implausible and violates the required sequence.  
- Even if “packaging” is assumed to be instantaneous or implicit, the normative process **requires** it as a distinct, mandatory step. The event log does not include it, so we must assume it was omitted — hence a deviation.

 **Violation: Ship order without Package items**

*(Note: One might argue that "Package items" is redundant if items are shipped directly from inventory — but the normative description mandates it as a required step. Since the process model includes it as a required activity, its absence constitutes a violation.)*

###  Final Answer:

#### **Cases that violate the normative process:**

| Case ID | Violations |
|---------|------------|
| **2**   | `Package items` occurs before `Authorize payment` — violates dependency that payment must be authorized before packaging. |
| **3**   | 1. `Authorize payment` occurs **after** inventory check but **before** cancellation — illogical, since cancellation should be immediate if inventory is insufficient.<br>2. `Ship order` occurs **after** `Cancel order` — explicitly forbidden. |
| **5**   | `Ship order` occurs **without** `Package items` — violates mandatory sequence requiring packaging before shipping. |

#### **Cases that comply:**
- **Case 1**: Fully compliant.
- **Case 4**: Fully compliant.

###  Interpretation of Ambiguities:

- **Can payment be authorized before cancellation?**  
   No. The process states that cancellation follows *immediately* upon insufficient inventory. Authorizing payment *after* discovering insufficient stock is a contradiction — it implies the system ignored the inventory check result.

- **Is “Package items” optional?**  
   No. The normative description explicitly states: “Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with ‘Ship order.’” Its absence is a deviation, even if operationally plausible in some contexts. We must follow the described model.

- **Can “Close order” be preceded by other activities after cancellation?**  
   No. The description states cancellation must be immediately followed by closing. Any other activity (like shipping) after cancellation is invalid.

---

###  Summary:

**Violating Cases: 2, 3, and 5**  
**Compliant Cases: 1 and 4**

**Reasons:**
- **Case 2**: Package before payment authorization.
- **Case 3**: Payment authorized then canceled, then shipped — multiple critical violations.
- **Case 5**: Missing mandatory “Package items” step before shipping.

All violations contravene explicit constraints in the normative description regarding sequencing, dependencies, and irreversibility of cancellation.
