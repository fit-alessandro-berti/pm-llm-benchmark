To model the temporal profile for the global supply chain process involved in manufacturing high-tech electronics, we'll consider various activities and estimate their average time delays between subsequent events across different executions of this process. This estimation will incorporate typical variability observed in industrial processes. Below is a representative Python dictionary that captures these dynamics:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP)
    ('SS', 'OP'): (72 * 60, 30 * 60),  # Average: 1 hour, Standard Deviation: 30 minutes

    # Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (48 * 60, 24 * 60),   # Average: 8 hours, Standard Deviation: 4 hours
    
    # Receive Components (RC) to Quality Inspection (QI)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (12 * 60, 6 * 60),     # Average: 2 hours, Standard Deviation: 1 hour

    # Quality Inspection (QI) to Component Assembly (CA)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (24 * 60, 12 * 60),   # Average: 4 hours, Standard Deviation: 2 hours
    
    # Component Assembly (CA) to Product Testing (PT)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (18 * 60, 9 * 60),     # Average: 3 hours, Standard Deviation: 1.5 hours

    # Product Testing (PT) to Packaging (PK)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (72 * 60, 36 * 60),   # Average: 2 hours, Standard Deviation: 6 hours
    
    # Packaging (PK) to Warehouse Storage (WS)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (12 * 60, 6 * 60),     # Average: 2 hours, Standard Deviation: 1 hour

    # Warehouse Storage (WS) to Distribution (DT)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (72 * 60, 36 * 60),   # Average: 2 hours, Standard Deviation: 6 hours
    
    # Distribution (DT) to After-Sales Support (AS)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (48 * 60, 24 * 60),   # Average: 8 hours, Standard Deviation: 4 hours

    # After-Sales Support (AS) back to Supplier Selection (SS) for next cycle
    ('AS', 'SS'): (72 * 60 + random_offset, 36 * 60 + random_offset)
}

# Note: In the last pair ('AS','SS'), a random offset might be added to simulate variability in repeat processes,
# but for simplicity, it is left as an illustrative example.
```

### Explanation:

- **Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP)**: The average time between these activities is set at 1 hour (72 minutes), with a standard deviation of 30 minutes. This reflects typical procurement lead times and variability in supplier response.

- **Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC)**: The delay averages about 8 hours, reflecting the manufacturing cycle before components are received. Variability is considered due to transportation delays or unforeseen supply chain disruptions.

- **Quality Inspection (QI) to Component Assembly (CA)**: After inspection, there's typically a gap of 4 hours for assembling components, with variability accounting for potential re-inspections or rework needed.

- **Component Assembly (CA) to Product Testing (PT)**: The average time between assembly and testing is 3 hours, reflecting the production cycle before products are tested. Variability can arise from different product complexity levels affecting test times.

- **Product Testing (PT) to Packaging (PK)**: Testing leads into packaging with an average delay of 2 hours, acknowledging variability in quality assurance processes or unexpected retests.

- **Packaging (PK) to Warehouse Storage (WS)**: The gap here is about 2 hours, indicating the time taken for final preparations before storage. Variability can occur due to different product sizes and packaging requirements.

- **Warehouse Storage (WS) to Distribution (DT)**: Shipping typically begins after a delay of approximately 2 hours from packaging, with significant variability reflecting logistical challenges or unexpected delays in transportation.

- **Distribution (DT) to After-Sales Support (AS)**: This final step captures the time taken for distribution and post-sale support, averaging around 8 hours, acknowledging the variability in shipping times, delivery logistics, and customer feedback cycles. The process then loops back to Supplier Selection for the next execution cycle, with a variable delay accounting for new procurement activities.

This temporal profile offers an estimated framework of delays between critical events within a complex supply chain, encapsulating both average expected durations and potential variability observed across various executions of this process.
