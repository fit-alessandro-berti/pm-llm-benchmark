Based on the provided BPMN diagram, it appears to be a process model that does not contain any explicit task elements. Instead, it contains sequence flows that represent the flow of work through different activities or operations in the process. However, depending on the context and specific requirements, these sequence flows may correspond to tasks or activities within a larger process. Without further information about the overall process and its goals, it is difficult to provide a definitive list of tasks in this process model.
