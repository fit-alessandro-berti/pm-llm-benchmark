Here is the comprehensive event log in Markdown format, derived from the provided ERP tables. Each row represents a single event in the order lifecycle, with chronological ordering and all required attributes.

### Assumptions:
1. **Item Picking Events**: Each line item in `Order Lines` generates a separate "Item Picked" event, as picking times may vary.
2. **Delivery Events**: Each `delivery_id` generates two events: "Order Dispatched" (at `delivery_dispatch_date`) and "Order Arrived" (at `delivery_arrival_date`).
3. **Invoice Events**: Each `invoice_id` generates an "Invoice Issued" event.
4. **Payment Events**: Each `payment_id` generates a "Payment Received" event, linked to the `invoice_id`.
5. **Resources**: Mapped to human-readable names using the `Resources Table`.
6. **Missing Data**: Order `1004` has no invoice or payment records (assumed incomplete or canceled).

### Notes:
1. **Chronological Order**: Events are sorted by `Timestamp` within each `Case ID`.
2. **Missing Data**: Order `1004` lacks delivery, invoice, and payment events (may indicate an incomplete process).
3. **Resources**: Mapped to names/roles where available (e.g., `picker_id`  `Warehouse Staff`).
4. **Other Attributes**: Includes item details, delivery notes, and payment methods for context.
