The illustration is divided into three labeled parts: (a), (b) and (c).

Part (a) – “Two pro­clet classes connected through two channels”  
1. Two vertical swim-lane-like columns represent two separate process fragments called “Lab visit” (on the left) and “Lab test” (on the right).  
2. Each column starts with a small black circle (start node) and ends with a small black bull-eye (end node).  
3. Inside “Lab visit” the flow goes downward through these activities, each drawn as a rounded rectangle:
   • Order entry  
   • Take blood sample  
   • Receive result  
   • Judge results (decision diamond immediately beneath; the two outcomes are “Everything fine” and “Do tests again”)  
   • Receive updated result (only taken in the “do again” branch)  
   • Send report  
4. Human stick-figure icons beside activities indicate which role performs the step: doctor, lab assistant, etc.  
5. Inside “Lab test” the flow is:
   • Perform test  
   • Make report  
   • (gateway) Perform test again / Provide updated report (for the repeat branch)  
   • Finish lab test  
6. The two columns are connected by two dashed, double-headed rectangles labelled “Order system” (higher in the diagram) and “HIS” (lower).  
   • Solid arrows run from “Order entry” to the Order-system channel and from that channel to “Perform test”.  
   • Later, arrows run from “Make report” back to “Receive result” through the HIS channel, and, in the repeat loop, from “Provide updated report” back to “Receive updated result”.  
   These arrows illustrate message exchange between the two processes.

Part (b) – “Class diagram containing the two proclet classes”  
A small UML-style class diagram appears at upper-right.  
   • A box named “Lab visit” is related to a box named “Lab test” by an association labelled “requires”.  
   • Multiplicity 1..1 is next to Lab visit end; multiplicity 1..* is next to Lab test end, expressing that one visit can require one or more tests.

Part (c) – “Example of a performative”  
A short table lists a sample message (performative) that might cross a channel:
   Time: 11:00  
   Channel: Order system  
   Sender: Lab visit – HGB John  
   Receivers: Lab test – HGB John  
   Action: Create  
   Content: “Can you perform a HGB test for John?”  
   Scope: Private  
   Direction: OUT

Overall, the composite figure shows how two interacting, rule-based micro-workflows (“proclets”)—one covering the patient’s laboratory visit and one covering the actual lab test—coordinate their work through explicit messaging channels, modeled both at the behavioral level (part a) and at the structural/class level (part b), with part c giving a concrete example of a message exchanged.
