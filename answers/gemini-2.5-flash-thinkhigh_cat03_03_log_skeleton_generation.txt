To construct the Log Skeleton for the given scenario, we'll define the relationships between activities based on their descriptions and the provided constraint definitions.

**Activities:**
*   **RO**: Receive Order
*   **CA**: Check Availability
*   **RI**: Reserve Items
*   **PI**: Pick Items
*   **QC**: Quality Check
*   **PO**: Pack Order
*   **GSL**: Generate Shipping Label
*   **D**: Dispatch
*   **IC**: Invoice Customer
*   **RP**: Record Payment

Here's the breakdown of each constraint type:

1.  **`equivalence`**: If the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one.
    *   In a typical order fulfillment process, activities rarely have strictly equivalent occurrences due to cancellations, re-work, or parallel flows that don't perfectly align. We assume that each activity has its distinct purpose and can occur independently or be skipped under certain conditions.
    *   **Result**: `set()`

2.  **`always_before`**: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously. (i.e., The second activity is a prerequisite for the first).
    *   `CA` requires `RO` to have happened. `(CA, RO)`
    *   `RI` requires `CA` to have happened. `(RI, CA)`
    *   `PI` requires `RI` to have happened. `(PI, RI)`
    *   `QC` requires `PI` to have happened. `(QC, PI)`
    *   `PO` requires `QC` to have happened. `(PO, QC)`
    *   `GSL` requires `PO` to have happened. `(GSL, PO)`
    *   `D` requires `GSL` to have happened. `(D, GSL)`
    *   `IC` requires `PO` to have happened (as items must be prepared/packed before invoicing). `(IC, PO)`
    *   `RP` requires `IC` to have happened. `(RP, IC)`
    *   **Result**: `set([('CA', 'RO'), ('RI', 'CA'), ('PI', 'RI'), ('QC', 'PI'), ('PO', 'QC'), ('GSL', 'PO'), ('D', 'GSL'), ('IC', 'PO'), ('RP', 'IC')])`

3.  **`always_after`**: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. (i.e., The second activity is a guaranteed consequence of the first, eventually). This assumes the "happy path" or successful completion of a sub-process once started.
    *   `RO` implies `CA` (if an order is received, it will be checked). `(RO, CA)`
    *   `CA` implies `RI` (if checked for availability, items will be reserved, assuming availability). `(CA, RI)`
    *   `RI` implies `PI` (if reserved, they will be picked). `(RI, PI)`
    *   `PI` implies `QC` (picked items undergo quality check). `(PI, QC)`
    *   `QC` implies `PO` (if quality checked, they are packed). `(QC, PO)`
    *   `PO` implies `GSL` (packed order gets a shipping label). `(PO, GSL)`
    *   `GSL` implies `D` (labeled package is dispatched). `(GSL, D)`
    *   `IC` implies `RP` (invoice leads to payment). `(IC, RP)`
    *   **Longer-range dependencies (assuming successful completion):**
        *   `RO` implies `D` (received order is eventually dispatched). `(RO, D)`
        *   `RO` implies `IC` (received order is eventually invoiced). `(RO, IC)`
        *   `PO` implies `IC` (packed order is eventually invoiced). `(PO, IC)`
        *   `D` implies `RP` (dispatched order's payment is recorded). `(D, RP)`
    *   **Result**: `set([('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('IC', 'RP'), ('RO', 'D'), ('RO', 'IC'), ('PO', 'IC'), ('D', 'RP')])`

4.  **`never_together`**: The two activities cannot co-exist inside the same case.
    *   All activities described are part of a single order's lifecycle. There are no explicitly stated alternative paths or mutually exclusive actions (e.g., "Cancel Order" vs "Dispatch").
    *   **Result**: `set()`

5.  **`activ_freq`**: Bounds the number of occurrences for an activity in a case.
    *   In a typical single order case, each activity would ideally occur once if it happens, or zero times if the process branches away or is cancelled before that step. Assuming no re-work loops for these activities in a single 'instance' of processing for an item, each activity occurs either 0 or 1 time.
    *   **Result**:
        ```python
        {
            'RO': {0, 1}, 'CA': {0, 1}, 'RI': {0, 1}, 'PI': {0, 1},
            'QC': {0, 1}, 'PO': {0, 1}, 'GSL': {0, 1}, 'D': {0, 1},
            'IC': {0, 1}, 'RP': {0, 1}
        }
        ```

6.  **`directly_follows`**: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity shall occur immediately after.
    *   `RO` directly to `CA`. `(RO, CA)`
    *   `CA` directly to `RI`. `(CA, RI)`
    *   `RI` directly to `PI`. `(RI, PI)`
    *   `PI` directly to `QC`. `(PI, QC)`
    *   `QC` directly to `PO`. `(QC, PO)`
    *   `PO` directly to `GSL`. `(PO, GSL)`
    *   `GSL` directly to `D`. `(GSL, D)`
    *   `IC` directly to `RP`. `(IC, RP)`
    *   **Result**: `set([('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('IC', 'RP')])`
