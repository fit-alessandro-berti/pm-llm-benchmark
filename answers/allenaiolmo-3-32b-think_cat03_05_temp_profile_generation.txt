Okay, I need to create a temporal profile for the given supply chain process. The user wants a Python dictionary where each key is a tuple of two activities, and the value is a tuple of average time and standard deviation. The pairs don't have to be directly connected; they can be any that eventually follow each other in the traces. But I have to estimate the times since they aren't provided.

First, let me list all the activities again to make sure I have them all:

Supplier Selection (SS), Order Placement (OP), Receive Components (RC), Quality Inspection (QI), Component Assembly (CA), Product Testing (PT), Packaging (PK), Warehouse Storage (WS), Distribution (DT), After-Sales Support (AS).

Now, I need to think about the sequence of these activities in a typical process flow. The standard path might be something like:

SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS

But the temporal profile needs to consider all possible pairs where one activity eventually comes after another. For example, SS to OP is direct, but SS to RC is also a pair since RC comes after SS in the sequence. Similarly, SS to DT would be a longer interval.

I need to estimate average times between each possible pair. But considering all possible pairs would be too much. The user says a "representative subset," so I should pick key pairs that are important or have significant delays. Maybe focus on adjacent steps first, then some non-adjacent ones to show the idea.

Let me start with the sequential steps. Let's outline the typical durations for each step. I'll have to make educated guesses here based on typical supply chain processes.

1. SS to OP: Once a supplier is selected, placing the order might be quick. Maybe a few hours? Let's say average 2 hours, SD 1 hour. So (7200, 3600) seconds.

2. OP to RC: Supplier lead time varies. Suppose it's about a week (604800 seconds), but maybe some suppliers are faster or slower. SD could be a couple of days, like 172800 seconds (2 days). So (604800, 172800).

3. RC to QI: Once components arrive, inspection might take a day. Average 86400, SD maybe 12 hours (43200). So (86400, 43200).

4. QI to CA: If inspection passes, assembly starts. Assembly could take a few days. Let's say 2 days (172800), SD maybe half a day (43200). (172800, 43200).

5. CA to PT: Testing after assembly. Maybe 1 day (86400), SD 6 hours (21600). (86400, 21600).

6. PT to PK: Packaging is quick, maybe a few hours. 4 hours (14400), SD 1 hour (3600). (14400, 3600).

7. PK to WS: Storage might be immediate, so maybe 0 delay? But perhaps some processing time. Maybe average 1 hour (3600), SD 0.5 hours (1800). (3600, 1800).

8. WS to DT: Distribution is shipping, which could vary. Suppose average 2 days (172800), SD a day (86400). (172800, 86400).

9. DT to AS: After-sales starts after delivery. Maybe a week (604800), but varies. SD maybe 2 days (172800). (604800, 172800).

Now, non-adjacent pairs. For example:

SS to RC: The total time from SS to RC would be SSOPRC. The average would be sum of SS-OP and OP-RC. So 7200 + 604800 = 612000 seconds. But maybe there's some variability in between. The SD would be sqrt( (SD1)^2 + (SD2)^2 ) if independent? Not sure, but maybe approximate. Alternatively, the total SD could be the sum? Maybe for simplicity, I'll take the sum of averages and SDs. But maybe that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the SD accumulates. Let's see:

SS to RC average: 7200 + 604800 = 612000 seconds. SD: sqrt(3600² + 172800²)  sqrt(1.3e9 + 2.98e10)  sqrt(3.11e10)  176,000 seconds. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, just use the same SD as OP-RC? Not sure. Maybe for simplicity, I'll estimate based on the total time. Let's say the average is the sum, and SD is maybe half the total time? Or maybe similar to the longest leg. Alternatively, just pick a reasonable SD. Let's say for SS to RC, average 612,000 (about 7.1 days), SD maybe 24 hours (86400). So (612000, 86400). But this is a rough estimate.

Another pair: SS to DT. That's the entire process except AS. The average would be sum of all steps up to DT. Let's see:

SS to DT path is SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDT. The total average would be adding all the averages:

7200 (SS-OP) + 604800 (OP-RC) + 86400 (RC-QI) + 172800 (QI-CA) + 86400 (CA-PT) + 14400 (PT-PK) + 3600 (PK-WS) + 172800 (WS-DT). Let's calculate:

7200 + 604800 = 611, 600? Wait let's do step by step:

7200 + 604800 = 611, 600? Wait:

7200 (SS-OP)

+604800 (OP-RC)  total 611, 600? Wait 7200 + 604800 is 611, 600? Wait 7200+604800 = 611, 600? Wait 604,800 +7,200 is 612,000.

Then +86,400 (RC-QI)  612k +86.4k = 698,400

+172,800 (QI-CA)  698,400 +172,800 = 871,200

+86,400 (CA-PT)  957,600

+14,400  972,000

+3,600  975,600

+172,800 (WS-DT)  975,600 +172,800 = 1,148,400 seconds.

That's about 13.3 days (since 1 day is 86400, so 1,148,400 /86400 13.3 days). The SD would be the sum of all the SDs? Or again, sqrt of sum of squares. Let's see:

The SDs are:

3600 (SS-OP), 172800 (OP-RC), 43200 (RC-QI), 43200 (QI-CA), 21600 (CA-PT), 3600 (PT-PK), 1800 (PK-WS), 86400 (WS-DT).

Adding them up for variance: each SD squared:

(3600)^2 = 12,960,000

(172800)^2 = ~2.985e10

(43200)^2 = ~1.866e9

(43200)^2 same as above

(21600)^2 = ~4.6656e8

(3600)^2 again

(1800)^2 = 3,240,000

(86400)^2 = ~7.46496e9

Adding all these up:

Let me approximate:

The largest terms are the OP-RC SD (172,800) which squared is about 2.985e10.

Then the WS-DT SD (86,400) squared is ~7.46e9, so total so far is ~3.73e10.

The others are smaller. Let's say total variance is roughly 3.73e10 + ... but this is getting too complex. Maybe for simplicity, the SD for SS to DT is the sum of all individual SDs? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the SD is about half the average time? The average is ~1.15e6 seconds. Half would be ~5.7e5. Let's say SD is 500,000 seconds (about 5.8 days). So the pair ('SS', 'DT') would be (1,148,400, 500000).

Another pair: OP to PT. That skips some steps. OP to PT path is OPRCQICAPT. The average would be OP-RC (604800) + RC-QI (86400) + QI-CA (172800) + CA-PT (86400). Sum is 604,800 +86,400 = 691,200 +172,800 = 864,000 +86,400 = 950,400 seconds. SD could be sum of those SDs or similar approach. Let's see the SDs for OP-RC (172800), RC-QI (43200), QI-CA (43200), CA-PT (21600). Adding those SDs: 172800 +43200 =216,000 +43,200 =259,200 +21,600 =280,800. But that's linear addition, which isn't technically correct, but maybe as an estimate. Alternatively, sqrt( (172800)^2 + (43200)^2 + (43200)^2 + (21600)^2 ). Let's approximate:

(172800)^2  2.98e10

43200^2 1.86e9 each, so two of them is ~3.72e9

21600^2 4.66e8

Total variance 2.98e10 +3.72e9 +4.66e8  ~3.33e10. Square root is ~182,500. So SD ~182,500. So the average is 950,400, SD ~182,500. So ('OP', 'PT') would be (950400, 182500).

Another non-adjacent pair: RC to DT. RC to DT path is RCQICAPTPKWSDT. The average would be RC-QI (86400) + QI-CA (172800) + CA-PT (86400) + PT-PK (14400) + PK-WS (3600) + WS-DT (172800). Adding those:

86,400 +172,800 =259,200 +86,400 = 345,600 +14,400 = 360,000 +3,600 =363,600 +172,800 = 536,400 seconds. SD could be the sum of their SDs: 43200 (RC-QI) +43200 (QI-CA) +21600 (CA-PT) +3600 (PT-PK) +1800 (PK-WS) +86400 (WS-DT). Sum is 43,200 +43,200 =86,400 +21,600 =108,000 +3,600 =111,600 +1,800 =113,400 +86,400 =199,800. So SD ~200,000? Or again sqrt of sum of squares. Let's see:

(43200)^2 + (43200)^2 + (21600)^2 + (3600)^2 + (1800)^2 + (86400)^2

That's 2*(1.866e9) + 4.6656e8 + 1.3e7 + 3.24e6 + 7.46496e9  3.732e9 + 4.6656e8  4.2e9 + 7.46e9  ~1.166e10. Square root is ~108,000. So SD ~108,000. So ('RC', 'DT') would be (536400, 108000).

Also, maybe some reverse pairs? Wait, no, because the temporal profile is for when the first activity precedes the second. So only pairs where the first comes before the second in the process.

Another example: After-Sales (AS) is at the end. So any activity before AS would have a pair with AS. For instance, DT to AS is already considered. What about PT to AS? PT is before AS. PT to AS path is PTPKWSDTAS. Let's compute that. The average would be PT-PK (14400) + PK-WS (3600) + WS-DT (172800) + DT-AS (604800). Wait, earlier I had DT to AS as 604800 (average 604800 seconds, which is 7 days). So sum:

14,400 +3,600 =18,000 +172,800 =190,800 +604,800 = 795,600 seconds. SD would be sum of SDs for each segment: PT-PK (3600), PK-WS (1800), WS-DT (86400), DT-AS (172800). Adding those SDs: 3600 +1800 =5400 +86,400 =91,800 +172,800 =264,600. Alternatively sqrt of squares. Let's see:

(3600)^2 + (1800)^2 + (86400)^2 + (172800)^2  1.3e7 + 3.24e6 + 7.46e9 + 2.98e10  ~3.27e10. sqrt is ~180,900. So SD ~181,000. So ('PT', 'AS') would be (795600, 181000).

Now, I need to pick a subset of these. Let's list some key pairs:

Adjacent steps (direct transitions):

('SS', 'OP'), ('OP', 'RC'), ('RC', 'QI'), ('QI', 'CA'), ('CA', 'PT'), ('PT', 'PK'), ('PK', 'WS'), ('WS', 'DT'), ('DT', 'AS')

Then some non-adjacent but important ones:

('SS', 'RC'), ('SS', 'DT'), ('OP', 'PT'), ('RC', 'DT'), ('PT', 'AS'), maybe ('CA', 'DT'), ('QI', 'AS'), etc.

Also, maybe some others like ('SS', 'CA'), but that's further. Let's pick a mix.

Let me compile the dictionary with both adjacent and some non-adjacent pairs.

First, the adjacent ones with their estimated averages and SDs as I thought earlier:

('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 3600)

('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 172800)

('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200)

('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 43200)

('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 21600)

('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 3600)

('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800)

('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 86400)

('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 172800)

Now non-adjacent:

('SS', 'RC'): (612000, 86400) [sum of SS-OP and OP-RC's averages, SD estimated as maybe 24h? Or perhaps higher? Let me think again. Earlier I thought 86400 SD. Alternatively, if the SD for OP-RC is 172800, and SS-OP is 3600, then total SD would be sqrt(3600² +172800²)  sqrt(1.3e7 + 2.98e10)  ~172,800. Wait, 172,800 squared is way bigger. So sqrt(172800² + ...) is approx 172,800. So maybe SD is ~172,800? But that would make the SD larger than the average. Wait, average is 612,000, SD ~172,800. That's possible. Let me recalculate:

For SS to RC: the path is two steps. The variance would be Var(OP-RC) + Var(SS-OP) because the delays are independent. So Var = (172800)^2 + (3600)^2  2.98e10 + 1.3e7  ~2.98e10. So sqrt is ~172,800. So SD is ~172,800. So the tuple would be (612000, 172800). That's better. I had miscalculated earlier. So that's better.

So adjusting:

('SS', 'RC'): (612000, 172800)

Similarly, ('SS', 'DT') which is the whole process except AS. Let's recalculate its average and SD properly.

Total average was 1,148,400 seconds.

The variance would be the sum of variances of all the steps from SS to DT:

SS-OP: Var = 3600²

OP-RC: 172800²

RC-QI:43200²

QI-CA:43200²

CA-PT:21600²

PT-PK:3600²

PK-WS:1800²

WS-DT:86400²

Adding all these variances:

3600² = 12,960,000

172800² = 29,859,840,000

43200² = 1,866,240,000 (each for RC-QI and QI-CA)

21600² = 466,560,000

3600² again 12,960,000

1800² = 3,240,000

86400² = 7,464,960,000

Adding all:

Let's compute step by step:

Start with 29,859,840,000 (OP-RC)

Add 1,866,240,000 *2 (RC-QI and QI-CA)  total + 3,732,480,000  total now 33,592,320,000

Add 466,560,000 (CA-PT)  34,058,880,000

Add 12,960,000 (SS-OP)  34,071,840,000

Add 12,960,000 (PT-PK)  34,084,800,000

Add 3,240,000 (PK-WS)  34,088,040,000

Add 7,464,960,000 (WS-DT)  34,088,040,000 +7,464,960,000 =41,553,000,000

So variance is 4.1553e10. The SD is sqrt(4.1553e10)  203,850 seconds. Approximately 203,850. Let's round to 204,000.

So ('SS', 'DT'): (1,148,400, 204000)

Now, another pair like ('OP', 'PT'). The path is OPRCQICAPT. The average is sum of OP-RC (604800), RC-QI (86400), QI-CA (172800), CA-PT (86400). Total: 604800 +86400 = 691200 +172800 =864,000 +86,400 = 950,400 seconds.

The variance is sum of each step's variance:

OP-RC:172800²

RC-QI:43200²

QI-CA:43200²

CA-PT:21600²

So:

172800² =29,859,840,000

43200² *2 = 2*(1,866,240,000) =3,732,480,000

21600² =466,560,000

Total variance: 29,859,840,000 +3,732,480,000 =33,592,320,000 +466,560,000 =34,058,880,000

SD is sqrt(34,058,880,000)  184,400 seconds. So ('OP', 'PT')  (950400, 184400)

Another pair: ('RC', 'DT'). Path is RCQICAPTPKWSDT. The average is sum of RC-QI (86400), QI-CA (172800), CA-PT (86400), PT-PK (14400), PK-WS (3600), WS-DT (172800). Total:

86400 +172800 =259,200 +86,400 =345,600 +14,400 =360,000 +3,600 =363,600 +172,800 =536,400 seconds.

Variance:

RC-QI:43200²

QI-CA:43200²

CA-PT:21600²

PT-PK:3600²

PK-WS:1800²

WS-DT:86400²

So:

43200² *2 = 2*(1.866e9) =3.732e9

21600² =4.6656e8

3600² =1.296e7

1800² =3.24e6

86400² =7.46496e9

Adding all:

3.732e9 +4.6656e8 =4.09856e9

+1.296e7  ~4.1098e9

+3.24e6  ~4.113e9

+7.46496e9  total 11.577e9

SD is sqrt(11.577e9) 107,600. So ('RC', 'DT'): (536400, 107600)

For ('PT', 'AS'): path PTPKWSDTAS. The average is PT-PK (14400) + PK-WS (3600) + WS-DT (172800) + DT-AS (604800). Total:

14,400 +3,600 =18,000 +172,800 =190,800 +604,800 =795,600 seconds.

Variance is sum of each segment's variance:

PT-PK:3600²

PK-WS:1800²

WS-DT:86400²

DT-AS:172800²

Calculating:

3600² =1.296e7

1800² =3.24e6

86400²=7.46496e9

172800²=2.985984e10

Total variance: 1.296e7 +3.24e6 1.62e7 +7.46496e9 7.481e9 +2.985984e10 3.75e10

SD is sqrt(3.75e10) 193,600. So ('PT', 'AS'): (795600, 193600)

I should also include some other non-adjacent pairs, maybe like ('CA', 'DT')?

Path CAPTPKWSDT. The average would be CA-PT (86400) + PT-PK (14400) + PK-WS (3600) + WS-DT (172800). Sum: 86400 +14400 =100,800 +3,600 =104,400 +172,800 =277,200 seconds.

Variance:

CA-PT:21600² =4.6656e8

PT-PK:3600² =1.296e7

PK-WS:1800² =3.24e6

WS-DT:86400²=7.46496e9

Total variance: 4.6656e8 +1.296e7 5.0e8 +3.24e6 5.0324e8 +7.46496e9 7.964e9. SD is sqrt(7.964e9) 89,200. So ('CA', 'DT')  (277200, 89200)

Another one: ('QI', 'AS'). Path QICAPTPKWSDTAS. Average is QI-CA (172800) + CA-PT (86400) + PT-PK (14400) + PK-WS (3600) + WS-DT (172800) + DT-AS (604800). Sum:

172800 +86400 =259,200 +14,400 =273,600 +3,600 =277,200 +172,800 =450,000 +604,800 =1,054,800 seconds.

Variance would be sum of each step's variance from QI to AS:

QI-CA:43200²

CA-PT:21600²

PT-PK:3600²

PK-WS:1800²

WS-DT:86400²

DT-AS:172800²

Adding:

43200² =1.866e9

21600² =4.6656e8

3600² =1.296e7

1800² =3.24e6

86400² =7.46496e9

172800² =2.985984e10

Total variance:

1.866e9 +4.6656e8 =2.33256e9 +1.296e7 2.344e9 +3.24e6 2.347e9 +7.46496e9 9.812e9 +2.985984e10 3.767e10

SD is sqrt(3.767e10) 194,060. So ('QI', 'AS')  (1054800, 194060)

Now, I need to choose a subset of these. The user said a representative subset, so maybe 10-15 pairs including some adjacent and some non-adjacent. Let's pick:

Adjacent pairs (9):

('SS', 'OP'), ('OP', 'RC'), ('RC', 'QI'), ('QI', 'CA'), ('CA', 'PT'), ('PT', 'PK'), ('PK', 'WS'), ('WS', 'DT'), ('DT', 'AS')

Non-adjacent:

('SS', 'RC'), ('SS', 'DT'), ('OP', 'PT'), ('RC', 'DT'), ('PT', 'AS'), ('CA', 'DT'), ('QI', 'AS')

That's 9 +7 =16 pairs. Maybe that's enough.

Now, compiling all the values:

First the adjacent ones:

1. ('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 3600)  2 hours average, 1 hour SD.

2. ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 172800)  ~1 week (7 days), SD ~2 days.

3. ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200)  1 day, 12 hours SD.

4. ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 43200)  2 days, 12 hours SD.

5. ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 21600)  1 day, 6 hours SD.

6. ('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 3600)  4 hours, 1 hour SD.

7. ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800)  1 hour, 30 mins SD.

8. ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 86400)  2 days, 1 day SD.

9. ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 172800)  7 days, 2 days SD.

Non-adjacent:

10. ('SS', 'RC'): (612000, 172800)  ~7.1 days (612000/86400 7.08 days), SD ~2 days (172800/86400=2 days).

Wait, 172800 seconds is exactly 2 days. So SD is 2 days. Interesting.

11. ('SS', 'DT'): (1,148,400, 204000). 1,148,400 /86400 13.3 days. SD 204000/86400 2.36 days.

12. ('OP', 'PT'): (950400, 184400). 950400/86400 11 days. SD ~184400/86400 2.13 days.

13. ('RC', 'DT'): (536400, 107600). 536400/86400 6.2 days. SD ~1.24 days.

14. ('PT', 'AS'): (795600, 193600). 795600/86400 9.2 days. SD ~2.23 days.

15. ('CA', 'DT'): (277200, 89200). 277200/86400 =3.2 days. SD ~1.03 days.

16. ('QI', 'AS'): (1054800, 194060). ~12.2 days average, SD ~2.24 days.

These seem reasonable. Now, I need to present them in a Python dictionary. Make sure the keys are tuples of the activity labels exactly as given. Let me check the activity names again:

The activities are:

Supplier Selection (SS), Order Placement (OP), Receive Components (RC), Quality Inspection (QI), Component Assembly (CA), Product Testing (PT), Packaging (PK), Warehouse Storage (WS), Distribution (DT), After-Sales Support (AS).

So the abbreviations are correct.

Now, writing the dictionary:

temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 3600),
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 172800),
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200),
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 43200),
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 21600),
    ('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 3600),
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 86400),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 172800),
    ('SS', 'RC'): (612000, 172800),
    ('SS', 'DT'): (1148400, 204000),
    ('OP', 'PT'): (950400, 184400),
    ('RC', 'DT'): (536400, 107600),
    ('PT', 'AS'): (795600, 193600),
    ('CA', 'DT'): (277200, 89200),
    ('QI', 'AS'): (1054800, 194060),
}

Wait, need to check the numbers for SS-DT: 1,148,400. I had written 1148400, which is correct (without comma). Similarly for others.

Also, ensure that all numbers are integers. The SDs can be approximate, but as per the problem statement, we can estimate. The user said "do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." So since I'm the LLM, these are my estimates.

Double-check some of the calculations for accuracy. For example, SS to RC's average is SS-OP (7200) + OP-RC (604800) = 612000. Correct. SD is sqrt(3600² +172800²)  sqrt( (3600)^2 + (172800)^2 ). Let's compute:

3600^2 = 12,960,000

172800^2 = (1728)^2 * 10^6 = 2,985,984 * 1e6? Wait no, 172800 is 172800 seconds. Squared is (172800)^2 = 29,859,840,000. Adding 12,960,000 gives 29,872,800,000. The square root of that is sqrt(29,872,800,000)  172,800.0007. So exactly 172,800. Because 172,800 squared is exactly 29,859,840,000. Wait, but adding 12,960,000 gives 29,872,800,000. Wait, that's not a perfect square. Hmm, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Wait, the variance is additive, so Var(SSRC) = Var(OP-RC) + Var(SS-OP). So Var = (172800)^2 + (3600)^2. So SD is sqrt( (172800)^2 + (3600)^2 )  172800.000 something. Since 3600 is much smaller than 172800, the SD is approximately 172800. So I can keep it as 172800 for simplicity. So the pair ('SS', 'RC') has SD 172800. That's acceptable as an estimate.

Similarly, other SDs might be approximated. The user allows estimation, so these numbers should be okay.

I think this covers a good subset. Let me check if I missed any important pairs. For example, ('QI', 'DT') might be another. But maybe that's covered by other paths. Alternatively, including it might add more, but the user said a representative subset. 16 pairs are probably sufficient.

Now, present this as the answer in a Python dictionary format.
