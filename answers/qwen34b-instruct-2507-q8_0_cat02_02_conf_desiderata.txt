Let's analyze the provided **event log** in full accordance with the **normative process behavior (strict rules)** and the **desiderata (recommended best practices)**.

---

##  **1. Identification of Cases Violating Normative Rules**

We will evaluate each case against the **strict sequence and ordering rules**.

---

###  **Case 1**

| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 09:00 | Application Received |
| 09:30 | Credit Check  |
| 10:00 | Risk Assessment  |
| 11:00 | Loan Decision (Approved)  |
| 13:00 | Inform Applicant  |
| 13:30 | Finalize Documentation  |
| 14:00 | Close Case  |

 **All activities follow the required sequence**:
- Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation (since approved)  Close Case

 **No skipped steps or reversed order**

 **Finalize Documentation occurs only after approval**, and before closing  compliant

 **Conclusion: Case 1 is fully compliant with normative rules.**

---

###  **Case 2**

| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 08:00 | Application Received |
| 08:20 | **Risk Assessment**  *(before Credit Check)* |
| 09:00 | Credit Check |
| 09:30 | Loan Decision (Rejected) |
| 10:00 | **Finalize Documentation**  *(after rejection)* |
| 10:30 | Close Case |

 **Violation 1: Risk Assessment before Credit Check**  
- **Normative Rule:** Credit Check must occur **before** Risk Assessment  
- This is a **direct violation** of the sequence rule.

 **Violation 2: Finalize Documentation after rejection**  
- **Normative Rule:** If rejected, documentation must **not** be finalized before closing the case  
- Finalizing documentation after a rejection is **explicitly forbidden**

 **Conclusion: Case 2 violates multiple normative rules.**  
 **Violations:**  
1. Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check  **Invalid sequence**  
2. Finalize Documentation after rejection  **Contradicts decision logic**

 **This is a serious breach of the process integrity.**

---

###  **Case 3**

| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 09:00 | Application Received |
| 01-14 10:00 | Credit Check  |
| 01-14 11:00 | Risk Assessment  |
| 01-14 12:00 | Loan Decision (Approved)  |
| 01-16 15:00 | Inform Applicant  |
| 01-17 09:00 | Finalize Documentation  |
| 01-17 10:00 | Close Case  |

 Sequence:  
- Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
 All steps in correct order

 Approved  Finalize documentation before closing  compliant

 No step skipped or out of order

 **Conclusion: Case 3 is fully compliant with normative rules.**

---

##  **2. Identification of Cases Failing the Desiderata**

Desiderata are **not strict**, so violations are **not serious**, but they represent suboptimal performance.

Let’s go through each:

---

###  **Case 1**

- Credit Check: 09:30  within 30 minutes of application (09:00)   (within 24h)
- Loan Decision: 11:00  2 hours after risk assessment
- Inform Applicant: 13:00  2 hours after decision  **within 48 hours**  
- Follow-up Call: **Not recorded**   (desideratum missing)

 **Violation of desiderata:**  
- **No follow-up call** before closing case  **suboptimal**, but not a violation

 **Conclusion:** Case 1 fails to meet one desideratum (follow-up call), but this is **non-critical**.

---

###  **Case 2**

- Credit Check: 09:00 (after risk assessment at 08:20)  **after** risk assessment  violates normative rule, so **desiderata cannot be evaluated** in a meaningful way here.
- But desiderata still apply to timing:
  - Credit Check done at 09:00  10 minutes after risk assessment  **not within 24h**, but since the sequence is broken, the timing is irrelevant in context.
  - Loan Decision: 09:30  1.5 hours after application  **within 24h**, acceptable
  - Inform Applicant: not recorded  **no information on timing**
  - Follow-up Call: not recorded  **missing**

 **Desiderata violations (non-critical):**
- **No follow-up call**  suboptimal
- **Credit Check delayed beyond 24h?**  No, it was only 1 hour after application  **within 24h**, so not a violation
- **No timing on informing applicant**  no violation (not recorded)

 **Conclusion:** Case 2 has **no desiderata violations** in terms of timing, but **lacks a follow-up call**  **suboptimal**, but not a serious issue.

>  Note: Since Case 2 violates **normative rules**, any desiderata analysis is secondary.

---

###  **Case 3**

- Application: 09:00 (01-12)
- Credit Check: 01-14 10:00  **5 days later**   **violates desideratum** (should be within 24 hours)
- Loan Decision: 01-14 12:00  2 days after application  acceptable
- Inform Applicant: 01-16 15:00  **2 days and 6 hours after decision**  **more than 48 hours**   violates recommended timing
- Follow-up Call: **Not recorded**   missing

 **Desiderata violations:**
1. Credit Check completed **5 days after application**  **violates recommended 24-hour window**
2. Applicant informed **after 48 hours**  **violates recommended promptness**
3. **No follow-up call**  suboptimal

 **Conclusion:** Case 3 fails **multiple desiderata**:
- Delayed credit check
- Delayed applicant notification
- Missing follow-up call

 These are **suboptimal** but **not serious violations**.

##  Final Summary

---

##  **Cases Violating Normative Rules**

| Case ID | Violation(s) | Reason |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **2** |  Risk Assessment before Credit Check<br> Finalize Documentation after Rejection | Both violate core sequencing and decision logic rules. These are **serious flaws** in process integrity. |

 **Cases 1 and 3** comply with **all normative rules**.

---

##  **Cases Failing Desiderata (Suboptimal but Not Serious)**

| Case | Desiderata Violations | Severity |
|------|------------------------|---------|
| **1** | Missing follow-up call | Low (non-critical) |
| **2** | Missing follow-up call | Low (non-critical) |
| **3** | <ul><li>Credit Check after 24h (5 days)</li><li>Applicant informed after 48h</li><li>No follow-up call</li></ul> | Medium (multiple suboptimal practices) |

>  **Note:** Desiderata are **not enforceable** — deviations do not impact compliance with the process.

---

##  Interpretations & Justifications (When Possible)

###  Case 2: Why might this happen?

- **Possible justification:** System error or manual override where an operator bypassed the workflow due to urgency or misinterpretation of the rule.
- **Systemic issue:** Lack of automated workflow enforcement or insufficient training.
- **Risk:** This behavior undermines process reliability and could lead to financial or reputational harm if repeated.

>  **Interpretation:** The sequence was **manually manipulated**, violating core logic. This suggests **a need for workflow automation or process monitoring** to prevent such deviations.

---

###  Case 3: Why is the credit check delayed?

- **Possible justification:** Operational backlog, system downtime, or staffing delays — common in high-volume or resource-constrained environments.
- **Follow-up call missing:** Could be due to operational oversight or lack of a formal follow-up protocol.

>  **Interpretation:** While the process is technically correct, **delays in key steps reduce customer satisfaction** and may increase applicant churn. This highlights a **gap in operational efficiency**, not a process violation.

---

##  Final Answer

---

### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules:**

 **Case 2 only**

- **Violation 1:** Risk Assessment performed **before** Credit Check  violates sequence rule.
- **Violation 2:** Finalize Documentation after a **rejected** loan  violates decision logic.

> These are **serious process violations** and must be corrected immediately.

---

### **2. Cases Failing Desiderata (Suboptimal but Not Serious):**

 All cases have **at least one desideratum failure**, but only **Case 3** has multiple:

- **Case 1:** Missing follow-up call
- **Case 2:** Missing follow-up call
- **Case 3:** 
  - Credit Check after 5 days (violates 24-hour guideline)
  - Applicant informed after 48+ hours (violates prompt notification)
  - No follow-up call

> These are **not serious violations**, but indicate **room for improvement** in service quality and customer experience.

---

### **3. Interpretations & Recommendations**

| Case | Interpretation | Suggested Action |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **Case 2** | Manual error or workflow bypass | Implement automated workflow enforcement with alerts for out-of-sequence activities. Add mandatory training and audit logs. |
| **Case 3** | Operational delay due to resource constraints | Improve staffing or process scheduling to ensure credit checks occur within 24 hours. Set up reminder systems for timely applicant communication. Introduce a follow-up call protocol. |

---

##  Conclusion

- **Normative compliance:** Only **Case 1 and 3** are fully compliant. **Case 2 is non-compliant** and requires urgent review and correction.
- **Desiderata compliance:** All cases fall short in at least one area, but **no serious operational or legal issues** are present.
- **Overall:** The process framework is robust, but **requires stronger automation and monitoring** to prevent workflow deviations and improve service responsiveness.

>  **Key Takeaway:** While desiderata are recommendations, **normative rules are non-negotiable** — and **Case 2 must be corrected immediately** to preserve process integrity.

--- 

 **Final Boxed Answer:**

```text
1. Cases violating normative rules: Only Case 2.
   - Violation: Risk Assessment before Credit Check and Finalize Documentation after rejection.

2. Cases failing desiderata:
   - Case 1: Missing follow-up call
   - Case 2: Missing follow-up call
   - Case 3: Credit check after 5 days, applicant informed after 48h, missing follow-up call
    These are suboptimal but not serious violations.

3. Interpretations:
   - Case 2 likely resulted from workflow bypass or human error; requires automated enforcement.
   - Case 3 reflects operational delays; needs better scheduling and follow-up protocols.
```

This analysis ensures strict adherence to process integrity while acknowledging real-world operational challenges.
