1. How does the company balance time-to-market pressures for new smartphone models with the need for robust design validation, supplier qualification, and long-term component availability?

2. In what ways do varying lead times and reliability across suppliers (e.g., Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, US) influence safety stock policies, and how often are those policies recalibrated?

3. How are supplier performance metrics (quality, on-time delivery, responsiveness to disruptions) integrated into sourcing decisions, and what thresholds trigger a reallocation of volumes or dual-sourcing?

4. What strategies are in place to mitigate geopolitical risks, export controls, and trade policy changes that could impact key components or logistics routes?

5. How are demand forecasts for different regions generated, validated, and reconciled when sales, marketing, and operations have conflicting views of future demand?

6. What mechanisms exist to detect and respond quickly to forecast errors, and how does the organization quantify and learn from the cost of over-forecasting versus under-forecasting?

7. How does the company manage the tension between just-in-time replenishment for high-demand markets and the risk of supply disruptions or transportation delays?

8. In slower-moving markets, how are shipment consolidation decisions made to balance freight cost savings against potential lost sales, aging inventory, and reduced market responsiveness?

9. How are production schedules at the Malaysian assembly plant dynamically adjusted in response to real-time changes in component availability, quality issues, or shifts in regional demand?

10. What is the end-to-end traceability strategy (from raw materials to end customer), and how is traceability data used to improve recalls, warranty management, and regulatory compliance?

11. How are quality issues identified at different points in the chain (supplier, assembly, distribution, post-sale) linked back to root causes, and how quickly can corrective actions cascade upstream?

12. What criteria determine whether certain customers (e.g., VIP, pre-order) receive prioritized allocation during constrained supply, and how are those decisions communicated and justified internally?

13. How are environmental and labor compliance standards enforced and verified across geographically dispersed suppliers, logistics partners, and subcontractors?

14. In what ways are carbon footprint, energy usage, and packaging waste measured across the supply chain, and how do these metrics influence sourcing, transportation mode, and network design decisions?

15. How are multi-currency exposures, fluctuating exchange rates, and inflation in different regions incorporated into total landed cost calculations and pricing strategies?

16. What governance and data quality controls ensure that digital systems (ERP, WMS, TMS, planning tools) share consistent, accurate, and timely information across all entities?

17. How are machine learning forecasts and optimization recommendations validated against human expertise, and what happens when algorithmic outputs conflict with planner intuition?

18. What scenario planning and simulation capabilities exist to test the impact of major disruptions (e.g., port closures, pandemics, supplier bankruptcy, sudden demand spikes) on service levels and costs?

19. How is intellectual property protected throughout the network—especially when multiple third-party manufacturers, logistics providers, and repair centers handle sensitive designs and components?

20. Which key performance indicators (KPIs) best capture the trade-offs between cost, speed, resilience, sustainability, and customer experience, and how are these KPIs used to drive continuous improvement?
