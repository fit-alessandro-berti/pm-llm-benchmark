Here's a breakdown of the violating cases in the event log and the reasons behind the violations:

**Case 3:**

* **Violation:**  "Ship order" occurs before "Cancel order" is fully completed.
* **Explanation:** The normative process clearly states that "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items," *and* should never happen after a cancellation. In case 3, the order is canceled, yet "Ship order" still takes place. This directly contradicts the defined flow for insufficient inventory scenarios.

**Case IDs 1 and 2:** These cases follow the normative process correctly as the order was fulfilled.

 **Case 4:**

* **Violation:**  The "Package items" and "Authorize Payment" activities are missing before "Cancel order" and "Close order."

* **Explanation:** While case 4 correctly cancels the order when inventory is insufficient, it skips the "Package items" and "Authorize Payment" steps that are expected to occur before "Cancel order" in this branch of the process. 

**Case 5:**

* **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs before "Package items" 
* **Explanation:** Although "Authorize payment" successfully precedes "Ship order,"  the normative process mandates that "Package items" must happen before "Ship order."
