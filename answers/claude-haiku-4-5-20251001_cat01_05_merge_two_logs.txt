# Integrated Event Log Analysis & Merging

## 1. EVENT MATCHING ANALYSIS

I will systematically match events from Log A and Log B using the following criteria:
- **Primary key**: `order_id` (both logs use Order#1234)
- **Matching window**: ±2 seconds tolerance for timestamps
- **Secondary indicators**: Event type semantics and sequence logic

### Matching Results:

| Log A Event | Log B Event | Match Confidence | Timestamp Diff | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Order Received (10:00:00Z) | OrderReceived (09:59:58Z) | **VERY HIGH** | -2 sec | **MATCH** |
| Order Validated (10:01:30Z) | OrderValidation (10:01:29Z) | **VERY HIGH** | -1 sec | **MATCH** |
| Payment Processed (10:02:00Z) | PaymentCheck (10:02:05Z) | **HIGH** | +5 sec | **MATCH*** |
| Item Shipped (10:05:00Z) | Shipping (10:05:02Z) | **VERY HIGH** | +2 sec | **MATCH** |
| Item Delivered (10:20:00Z) | *(no match)* | N/A | N/A | **UNMATCHED** |
| *(no match)* | Quality Check (10:03:00Z) | N/A | N/A | **UNMATCHED** |

**\* Note on Payment event**: Difference of 5 seconds exceeds the 2-second tolerance slightly, but the semantic alignment (Payment Processed  PaymentCheck) and sequential positioning strongly indicate this is the same event. The 5-second variance is plausible given system processing delays (e.g., "payment gateway delay" noted in Log B).

## 2. MERGED EVENT LOG

```
Timestamp (Primary) | Event Type | Order ID | User ID | Resource ID | Notes | Source Logs
==================|============|========|========|============|========|==============

2023-10-10T09:59:58Z | Order Received | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | Event captured at warehouse system | A + B
                     | (Log A ts: 10:00:00Z)

2023-10-10T10:01:29Z | Order Validated | Order#1234 | u12 | r10 | Cross-check inventory | A + B
                     | (Log A ts: 10:01:30Z)

2023-10-10T10:02:00Z | Payment Processed | Order#1234 | u12 | r99 | Payment gateway delay (Log B ts: 10:02:05Z) | A + B

2023-10-10T10:03:00Z | Quality Check | Order#1234 | u45 | r11 | Random inspection | B Only

2023-10-10T10:05:00Z | Item Shipped | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | Package handed to courier (Log B ts: 10:05:02Z) | A + B

2023-10-10T10:20:00Z | Item Delivered | Order#1234 | N/A | N/A | No matching event in Log B | A Only
```

## 3. DETAILED REASONING FOR DECISIONS

###  **Matched Events (4 pairs):**

#### **Event 1: Order Received**
- **Log A**: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z, "Order Received"
- **Log B**: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, "OrderReceived"
- **Reasoning**: 
  - Identical semantic meaning
  - 2-second timestamp difference is within tolerance
  - Log B timestamp (09:59:58Z) is 2 seconds *earlier*, suggesting Log B captures the actual event time while Log A may capture receipt at a processing system
  - **Selected timestamp**: Log B (09:59:58Z) as it likely represents the true event initiation
  - **Decision**: Merged with all attributes from both logs

#### **Event 2: Order Validation**
- **Log A**: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z, "Order Validated"
- **Log B**: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, "OrderValidation"
- **Reasoning**:
  - Identical semantic meaning (slight naming variation)
  - 1-second difference well within tolerance
  - Both timestamps are nearly identical, indicating synchronized capture
  - **Selected timestamp**: Log B (10:01:29Z) as primary (marginally earlier)
  - **Decision**: Merged; Log B provides `user_id: u12` and `resource_id: r10` context

#### **Event 3: Payment Processing**
- **Log A**: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, "Payment Processed"
- **Log B**: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z, "PaymentCheck"
- **Reasoning**:
  - 5-second difference *exceeds* stated tolerance but is justified:
    - Log B explicitly notes "Payment gateway delay" — explaining the time variance
    - Semantic alignment is clear (both describe payment validation)
    - Sequential position is consistent (both 3rd event in order flow)
    - Within realistic system processing variance
  - **Selected timestamp**: Log A (10:02:00Z) as primary, Log B time noted in attributes
  - **Decision**: Merged with confidence; delay explanation documented

#### **Event 4: Item Shipped**
- **Log A**: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, "Item Shipped"
- **Log B**: 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z, "Shipping"
- **Reasoning**:
  - Clear semantic equivalence
  - 2-second difference within tolerance (exact threshold)
  - Log B provides operational detail: "Package handed to courier"
  - **Selected timestamp**: Log A (10:05:00Z) as primary (marginally earlier)
  - **Decision**: Merged

###  **Unmatched Events (2 events):**

#### **Event: Quality Check (Log B only)**
- **Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z
- **Details**: `user_id: u45, resource_id: r11, notes: "Random inspection"`
- **Reasoning**:
  - Appears only in Log B with no corresponding entry in Log A
  - Sequential position: Between Payment Processed (10:02) and Item Shipped (10:05)
  - Possible explanations:
    1. Log A does not track quality inspection events (scope difference between systems)
    2. Quality Check occurred but Log A's polling/event capture missed it
    3. This is a non-critical operational event not surfaced to Log A
  - **Decision**: Include as-is with **"B Only"** source marker; this may represent warehouse-level operations not tracked by order fulfillment system A

#### **Event: Item Delivered (Log A only)**
- **Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z
- **Details**: No corresponding entry in Log B
- **Reasoning**:
  - Appears only in Log A with no match in Log B (no events between 10:05:02Z and end of Log B)
  - Possible explanations:
    1. Log B's scope ends at shipping handoff (to courier), not final delivery
    2. Delivery is captured asynchronously in Log A but not yet in Log B (time lag)
    3. System B does not track post-handoff events
  - **Decision**: Include as-is with **"A Only"** source marker

## 5. SUMMARY OF INTEGRATION DECISIONS

| Decision | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Events Merged** | 4 | High confidence matches across both logs |
| **Events Log A Only** | 1 | Item Delivered (likely outside Log B's scope) |
| **Events Log B Only** | 1 | Quality Check (warehouse operation, not in Log A) |
| **Total Unified Events** | 6 | Complete order fulfillment flow |
| **Timestamp Tolerance Used** | 2 sec (strict), 5 sec (justified exception) | Payment event exceeded tolerance due to documented delay |
| **Data Enrichment** | 4/5 merged | Log B's user_id and resource_id attributes added to Log A events |

---

## 6. ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITATIONS

1. **Assumption**: Log A timestamps may represent event *receipt* time vs. Log B's *occurrence* time  Log B times selected where earlier
2. **Assumption**: 5-second Payment variance is justified by explicit "payment gateway delay" note in Log B
3. **Assumption**: Unmatched events (Quality Check, Item Delivered) represent scope differences between systems, not data loss
4. **Limitation**: No user_id available for Item Delivered event (Log A only) — data gap
5. **Limitation**: Cannot confirm Quality Check actually applied to Order#1234 vs. concurrent processing without additional context
