 To generate a temporal profile for the process, I would need to calculate the average and standard deviation for the time between each pair of activities that directly or indirectly follow each other in at least one process execution. It appears that the event data needed for these calculations, such as the time stamps for each activity, are not provided in the information you've shared.

However, I can guide you on how to calculate the temporal profile given the required data:

1. First, calculate the time difference (in seconds, minutes, hours, or any standard time unit you prefer) between the start time of each activity in a process execution and store it for each pair of activities.

2. Then, calculate the average (AVG) time difference for each pair of activities.

3. After that, calculate the standard deviation (STDEV) of the time difference for each pair of activities.

4. Store this information in a dictionary as follows:
```
temporal_profile = {
    ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (AVG_1, STDEV_1),
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (AVG_2, STDEV_2),
    ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add Penalty'): (AVG_3, STDEV_3),
    ('Add Penalty', 'Payment'): (AVG_4, STDEV_4),
    ...
}
```

5. For visualization, you can create a graph where the nodes are the activities and the edges represent the average time between the two activities (with the option to color or style the edges based on the STDEV).

Remember to replace the activity names in the dictionary keys with the actual names of the activities in your process, and adjust the calculations to reflect your chosen time unit.

If you provide the event data for this process, I can help you calculate the temporal profile and generate Python code for it.
