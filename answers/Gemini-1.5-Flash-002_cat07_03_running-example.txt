That's a flowchart depicting a process, likely for handling requests (e.g., insurance claims, compensation requests). Let's break down the steps:

1. **Start:** The process begins.

2. **Register Request:** A request is submitted and registered.

3. **Decision Point 1 (X/ +):**  The request is initially screened. A "+" indicates the request passes initial screening.  An "X" means it fails and the process might follow a different path.

4. **Check Ticket (If + from Step 3):**  If the initial screening is successful, the ticket is checked.  This might involve verifying the request's validity and legitimacy based on pre-set criteria.

5. **Examine Thoroughly/ Casually (If + from Step 3):**  Depending on the ticket check's outcome, the request is examined either thoroughly (more detailed investigation) or casually (a quicker assessment).

6. **Decision Point 2 (X/ +):**  A second check determines whether the examination (thorough or casual) was satisfactory. Again, "+" means it is, "X" means it isn't.

7. **Decide (If + from Step 6):** If the examination was successful, the request is assessed and a decision is made.

8. **Decision Point 3 (X/ +):** A final decision is reached on whether to approve or reject the request.

9. **Reject Request (If X from Step 8):**  If the request is rejected, the process ends.

10. **Pay Compensation (If + from Step 8):** If approved, compensation is paid, and the process ends.

11. **Reinitiate Request (If X from Step 3 or X from Step 6):**  If the initial screening fails or the examination reveals insufficient information, the request needs further attention, potentially involving the requester for clarification. The cycle restarts from the beginning (or from a specific point depending on the nature of the flaw).

12. **End:** The process concludes.

**In short:** The flowchart outlines a systematic way to process requests, involving multiple checks and levels of examination to ensure thoroughness and accuracy before reaching a final decision.  The use of decision points allows for branching paths depending on the outcome of assessments.
