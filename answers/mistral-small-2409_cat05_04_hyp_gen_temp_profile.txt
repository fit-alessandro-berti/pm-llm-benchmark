### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**:
   - **Anomaly**: The average time of ~1.04 days with a very low standard deviation of 1 hour is suspicious. This suggests an unnaturally tight schedule for approvals.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:
   - **Anomaly**: An extremely long average delay of 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days is unusual. This indicates inconsistent timing for notification after approval.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:
   - **Anomaly**: A relatively quick closure (2 hours on average) after assignment, without consistent intermediate steps like Evaluate or Approve, suggests premature closures.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:
   - **Anomaly**: The average time of only 5 minutes between evaluation and notification is very short and might not align with business rules, indicating potential skipping of intermediate steps.

### Hypotheses on the Causes of Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Automated approval process might be enforcing a rigid schedule, possibly bypassing necessary evaluations.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Internal backlog or resource constraints might be causing significant delays in notification after approval, leading to inconsistent timing.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Some claims might be closed prematurely without proper evaluation or approval steps, possibly due to administrative errors or oversights.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: The system might be automating the notification step too quickly after evaluation, possibly skipping required checks or reviews.

### SQL Queries for Verification

1. **Identify Claims with Unusual Time Intervals Between Activities:**

   ```sql
   -- Claims where Receive to Approve is outside 1 standard deviation
   SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.activity, ce2.activity,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS time_hours
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'R'
     AND ce2.activity = 'P'
     AND ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce2.timestamp)) / 3600 - 25) > 1;
   ```

   ```sql
   -- Claims where Approve to Notify is outside 2 days standard deviation
   SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.activity, ce2.activity,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 86400 AS time_days
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'P'
     AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce2.timestamp)) / 86400 - 7) > 2;
   ```

2. **Correlate Anomalies with Specific Adjusters or Resources:**

   ```sql
   -- Claims closed immediately after assignment
   SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.adjuster_id, ce2.adjuster_id,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS time_hours
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'A'
     AND ce2.activity = 'C'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 < 2;
   ```

   ```sql
   -- Claims where Approve to Notify takes excessively long
   SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.adjuster_id, ce2.adjuster_id,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 86400 AS time_days
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'P'
     AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 86400 > 9;
   ```

3. **Filter by Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment or Long Approval to Notification:**

   ```sql
   -- Claims closed immediately after assignment
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.customer_id,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS time_hours
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'A'
     AND ce2.activity = 'C'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 < 2;
   ```

   ```sql
   -- Claims where Approve to Notify takes excessively long
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.customer_id,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 86400 AS time_days
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'P'
     AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 86400 > 9;
   ```

These queries will help in identifying specific cases where the process deviates from expected behavior and allow for further investigation into the causes of these anomalies.
