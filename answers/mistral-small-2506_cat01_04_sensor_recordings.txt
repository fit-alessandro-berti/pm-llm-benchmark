### Analysis of Event Log and Activity Labeling

By examining the sensor readings across the events, we can identify distinct phases in the manufacturing process. Below is the labeled breakdown of the activities, along with the rationale for each label.

---

### **1. Idle/Standby (Events 1-3, 13-15)**
- **Sensor Patterns:**
  - Temperature: ~20°C (low and stable)
  - Pressure: 1 bar (low and stable)
  - Vibration: 0 Hz (no movement)
  - Material Flow: 0 units/s (no material movement)
  - Tool Position: 0 mm (retracted)
  - Energy: ~0.4–0.5 kWh (low baseline consumption)
- **Rationale:**
  The machine is not actively performing any operation. The low energy, stable temperature, and lack of vibration or material flow indicate an idle or standby state.

---

### **2. Cutting Metal (Events 4-6)**
- **Sensor Patterns:**
  - Temperature: Rises from 21°C to 58°C (rapid increase)
  - Pressure: 1–1.5 bar (moderate increase)
  - Vibration: 30–38 Hz (high, indicating mechanical motion)
  - Material Flow: 5 units/s (steady flow)
  - Tool Position: 5–10 mm (advancing)
  - Energy: 2.0–3.0 kWh (high consumption)
- **Rationale:**
  The sharp rise in temperature, high vibration, and steady material flow suggest a cutting operation. Cutting typically involves friction (heat), mechanical motion (vibration), and energy-intensive work.

### **3. Assembling Parts (Events 7-8)**
- **Sensor Patterns:**
  - Temperature: 40°C (moderate and stable)
  - Pressure: 2 bar (moderate)
  - Vibration: 10 Hz (low, steady)
  - Material Flow: 2 units/s (steady but lower than cutting)
  - Tool Position: 15 mm (stable)
  - Energy: 2.0 kWh (moderate)
- **Rationale:**
  The stable but moderate conditions (temperature, pressure, and vibration) with a steady material flow suggest assembly. Assembly involves controlled movement (low vibration) and moderate energy usage.

### **4. Welding (Event 9)**
- **Sensor Patterns:**
  - Temperature: 80°C (very high)
  - Pressure: 2 bar (moderate)
  - Vibration: 50 Hz (high)
  - Material Flow: 0 units/s (no material movement)
  - Tool Position: 15 mm (stable)
  - Energy: 5.0 kWh (very high)
- **Rationale:**
  The extreme temperature spike, high vibration, and high energy consumption with no material flow indicate welding. Welding involves localized heating (high temperature) and energy-intensive work (high vibration and energy).

---

### **5. Quality Inspection (Events 10-12)**
- **Sensor Patterns:**
  - Temperature: 25–30°C (low and stable)
  - Pressure: 1 bar (low)
  - Vibration: 1–5 Hz (very low)
  - Material Flow: 0–1 units/s (minimal)
  - Tool Position: 15–20 mm (stable)
  - Energy: 1.0–1.6 kWh (low to moderate)
- **Rationale:**
  The low vibration, minimal material flow, and stable conditions suggest quality inspection. Inspection involves checking parts without significant mechanical or thermal activity.

### **Summary of Labeled Activities:**
| Event # | Activity               |
|---------|------------------------|
| 1-3, 13-15 | Idle/Standby          |
| 4-6      | Cutting Metal         |
| 7-8      | Assembling Parts      |
| 9        | Welding               |
| 10-12    | Quality Inspection    |

### **Key Observations:**
- **Cutting** is characterized by high temperature, vibration, and energy.
- **Assembling** has moderate, stable conditions with steady material flow.
- **Welding** shows extreme temperature and energy spikes.
- **Quality Inspection** has minimal activity, indicating a passive check.
- **Idle/Standby** has near-zero readings across all sensors.

This labeling provides a high-level understanding of the manufacturing process based on sensor patterns. Further refinement could involve clustering similar events or using machine learning for more precise activity detection.
