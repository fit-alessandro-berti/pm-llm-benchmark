Below is a representative Python dictionary that models a temporal profile for the described global supply chain process. The dictionary includes pairs of activities that eventually follow each other, with estimated average times (`average_time`) and standard deviations (`standard_deviation`) based on the complexity and nature of the process. The times are estimated to account for the delays influenced by procurement, manufacturing complexity, distribution network, and other factors.

```python
temporal_profile = {

### Explanation of the Estimations:
- **Procurement Phase (`SS`, `OP`, and `RC`)**: Times are typically longer due to delays in approving suppliers, placing orders, and transporting materials.
- **Manufacturing Phase (`QI`, `CA`, and `PT`)**: These times are shorter, as companies aim to keep the production cycle efficient, but testing and quality inspections introduce variability.
- **Post-Manufacturing Phase (`PK`, `WS`, `DT`, and `AS`)**: Packaging is quick, but storage and distribution can vary widely depending on logistics. After-sales support has the longest delays due to customer interactions happening post-shipment.
- **Non-Immediate Sequences**: These represent cumulative delays between activities that are not directly sequential, incorporating the sum of typical delays from intermediaries.

This temporal profile captures the complexity and variability of a global supply chain, accounting for immediate and eventual relationships between activities. You can adjust the numerical estimates based on real-world data!
