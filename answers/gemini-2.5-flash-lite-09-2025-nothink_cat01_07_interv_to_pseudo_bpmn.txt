## BPMN-Like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Workflow

**Process Name:** Standard Invoice Approval and Payment Scheduling

**Pool/Lane Structure:**
1. **Accounts Payable (AP)** (Involves Clerk Mary, Supervisor Rita)
2. **Purchasing Department (PD)** (Involves Officer Dan)
3. **Department Manager (DM)** (Involves Manager Carlos)
4. **External Parties** (Supplier/Vendor)

### Process Flow Description

**START EVENT: Invoice Receipt**

| Step No. | Lane/Role | Activity/Task | Sequence Flow / Gateway | Artifacts/Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.0** | AP (Mary) | Receive Invoice (via Email) | $\rightarrow$ **2.0** | Invoice Document |
| **2.0** | AP (Mary) | Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number | $\rightarrow$ **Gateway A (Exclusive)** | |
| **Gateway A** | AP (Mary) | **Decision:** PO Present? | **YES:** $\rightarrow$ **3.0** | |
| | | | **NO:** $\rightarrow$ **Exception Path 1** | |
| **Exception Path 1** | AP (Mary) / External | Request Missing PO Details from Supplier | $\rightarrow$ **1A.1** | *(Note: Karen [Supplier Manager] or AP handles communication with Supplier)* |
| **1A.1** | AP (Mary) | Wait for Supplier Response / Revised Invoice | $\rightarrow$ **Gateway A** (Loop back to check PO) | |
| **3.0** | AP (Mary) | Log Invoice into Accounting System | $\rightarrow$ **4.0** | System Entry |
| **4.0** | AP (Mary) | Forward to Purchasing for Goods Receipt Confirmation | $\rightarrow$ **5.0** | |
| **5.0** | PD (Dan) | Confirm Goods/Services Receipt against PO | $\rightarrow$ **Gateway B (Exclusive)** | |
| **Gateway B** | PD (Dan) | **Decision:** Goods Receipt Confirmed? | **NO:** $\rightarrow$ **Exception Path 2** | *(Implied, if receipt is not confirmed, process stalls until confirmed)* |
| | | | **YES:** $\rightarrow$ **6.0** | |
| **Exception Path 2** | PD (Dan) / AP | Clarify Receipt Status (Contact Supplier/Logistics) | $\rightarrow$ **Gateway B** (Loop back) | |
| **6.0** | AP (Mary) | Match Invoice Line Items to PO (Quantity/Price) | $\rightarrow$ **Gateway C (Exclusive)** | |
| **Gateway C** | AP (Mary) | **Decision:** Match Successful (No Discrepancies)? | **YES:** $\rightarrow$ **8.0** (Move to Manager Approval) | |
| | | | **NO (Discrepancy Found):** $\rightarrow$ **7.0** | |
| **7.0** | AP (Mary) / PD (Dan) | **Discrepancy Resolution Loop:** Clarify Issue (AP emails Purchasing, or seek Supplier correction) | $\rightarrow$ **7A.1** | *(Note: Karen may be looped in here to check contract terms)* |
| **7A.1** | AP (Mary) / Supervisor (Rita) | **Decision Point (Escalation):** Is discrepancy easily resolved? | **NO:** $\rightarrow$ **7B.1** (Escalate to Supervisor) | |
| **7B.1** | Supervisor (Rita) | Resolve Complex Exception (e.g., Create Retrospective PO) | $\rightarrow$ **6.0** (Loop back to Re-Match) | *(Rita handles cases where PO is missing or resolution is complex)* |
| **8.0** | AP (Mary) | Forward to Department Manager for Final Approval | $\rightarrow$ **9.0** | *(System sends automatic email notification)* |
| **9.0** | DM (Carlos) | Review Invoice, PO, and Confirmations | $\rightarrow$ **Gateway D (Exclusive)** | |
| **Gateway D** | DM (Carlos) | **Decision:** Approve? | **YES:** $\rightarrow$ **10.0** | |
| | | | **NO (Suspicious/Reject):** $\rightarrow$ **9A.1** | *(Carlos may ask Mary to hold/investigate further)* |
| **9A.1** | DM (Carlos) / AP (Mary) | Hold Invoice / Investigate Further | $\rightarrow$ **6.0** (Loop back to reconciliation/matching) | |
| **10.0** | AP (Mary) | Schedule Invoice for Payment Run | $\rightarrow$ **END EVENT** | |

**END EVENT: Payment Scheduled**

### Summary of Key Process Elements

1.  **Initial Gateways & Roles:**
    *   **Gateway A (PO Check):** AP (Mary) performs initial validation. If missing, it initiates communication with the Supplier (potentially via Karen) or reverts to itself.
    *   **Gateway B (Receipt Confirmation):** PD (Dan) confirms physical receipt against the PO.

2.  **Exception and Rework Loops:**
    *   **Discrepancy Loop (Gateway C):** If pricing or quantity mismatches occur, AP loops with Purchasing (Dan) to clarify. This can escalate to the **AP Supervisor (Rita)** if internal resolution fails, or involve the **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** to verify contractual terms.
    *   **Manager Rejection (Gateway D):** If the Manager rejects the invoice, the process loops back to the reconciliation step (Step 6.0) for further investigation.

3.  **Process Handoffs:**
    *   **AP $\rightarrow$ Purchasing:** For goods receipt confirmation (Step 4.0).
    *   **Purchasing $\rightarrow$ AP:** Confirmation email received (Step 5.0 $\rightarrow$ 6.0).
    *   **AP $\rightarrow$ Manager:** For final sign-off (Step 8.0).
    *   **Manager $\rightarrow$ AP:** After final approval (Step 10.0).

4.  **Artifacts:**
    *   Invoice Document
    *   Purchase Order (PO) (Used as a key reference object)
    *   System Entry/Confirmation Email (Triggering manager approval)
