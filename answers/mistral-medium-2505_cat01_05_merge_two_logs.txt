### **Merged Event Log with Reasoning**

Below is the integrated event log, combining events from **Log A** and **Log B** where possible, while preserving unmatched events. The merged log includes all available attributes, and events are ordered chronologically based on the primary timestamp (Log A's timestamps are treated as authoritative unless a clear mismatch exists).

### **Final Merged Event Log**

| **Timestamp (Primary)** | **Event Type (Log A)** | **Event Name (Log B)** | **Order ID** | **User ID** | **Resource ID** | **Notes** | **Source** |
|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z    | Order Received         | OrderReceived          | Order#1234   | u45         | r10            | "Event captured at warehouse system" | Merged (Log A + Log B) |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z    | Order Validated       | OrderValidation        | Order#1234   | u12         | r10            | "Cross-check inventory" | Merged (Log A + Log B) |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z    | Payment Processed      | PaymentCheck           | Order#1234   | u12         | r99            | "Payment gateway delay" | Merged (Log A + Log B) |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z    | -                      | Quality Check          | Order#1234   | u45         | r11            | "Random inspection" | Log B Only |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z    | Item Shipped           | Shipping               | Order#1234   | u45         | r10            | "Package handed to courier" | Merged (Log A + Log B) |
| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z    | Item Delivered         | -                      | Order#1234   | -           | -              | - | Log A Only |

### **Reasoning for Merging Decisions**

1. **Event Matching Criteria:**
   - **Order ID** must match.
   - **Event names** must be semantically similar (e.g., "Order Received"  "OrderReceived").
   - **Timestamps** must be within **2 seconds** of each other (to account for slight offsets).

2. **Merged Events:**
   - **Order Received / OrderReceived** (Log A: 10:00:00, Log B: 09:59:58)  **Merged** (timestamp difference: 2s, within tolerance).
   - **Order Validated / OrderValidation** (Log A: 10:01:30, Log B: 10:01:29)  **Merged** (timestamp difference: 1s).
   - **Payment Processed / PaymentCheck** (Log A: 10:02:00, Log B: 10:02:05)  **Merged** (timestamp difference: 5s, slightly outside tolerance but likely the same event).
   - **Item Shipped / Shipping** (Log A: 10:05:00, Log B: 10:05:02)  **Merged** (timestamp difference: 2s).

3. **Unmatched Events:**
   - **Quality Check (Log B, 10:03:00)**  No corresponding event in Log A  **Included as-is**.
   - **Item Delivered (Log A, 10:20:00)**  No corresponding event in Log B  **Included as-is**.

4. **Timestamp Selection:**
   - For merged events, **Log A’s timestamp is used as primary** (since it is the "primary" timeline).
   - If timestamps were more divergent, we could include both (e.g., `timestamp_A`, `timestamp_B`).

5. **Attribute Integration:**
   - All attributes from both logs are included in merged records.
   - Missing fields (e.g., `user_id` in Log A) are left blank.

### **Conclusion**
The merged log provides a **unified, enriched view** of the order fulfillment process, combining the best of both logs while preserving all available data. Events were matched based on **order_id, semantic similarity, and timestamp proximity**, with unmatched events retained for completeness. This approach ensures **accuracy, traceability, and minimal data loss**.
