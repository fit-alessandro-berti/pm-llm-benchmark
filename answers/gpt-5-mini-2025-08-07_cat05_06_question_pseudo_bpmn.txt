1. What are the strategic reasons for concentrating assembly in Malaysia, and how might alternative assembly locations change cost, lead time, and geopolitical risk profiles?

2. How would the process change if one critical component (e.g., microprocessors from Taiwan) experienced a prolonged supply disruption, and what contingency plans or dual-sourcing strategies are realistic?

3. In what ways could the parallel sourcing of camera modules, OLED screens, and other components be optimized to reduce total lead time without increasing inventory carrying costs?

4. How should the organization determine the right balance between air freight and ocean cargo for different markets, considering cost, time-to-market, carbon footprint, and demand volatility?

5. What decision rules and trigger thresholds should govern when a failed quality check leads to rework versus scrap, and how can those rules be aligned with sustainability and profitability goals?

6. How can data visibility across suppliers, the assembly plant, carriers, and regional distribution centers be improved to enable faster, more confident decision-making during exceptions?

7. What KPIs and performance metrics best capture end-to-end supply chain health for this process (e.g., OTIF, lead-time variance, yield rates, rework rate, carbon per unit), and how often should they be reviewed?

8. How might implementing predictive analytics or a digital twin of the process reduce downtime, improve forecasting, or accelerate root-cause analysis for defects and delays?

9. How should stakeholder communication protocols be structured (who is informed, when, and how) when there are delays at sourcing, assembly, or in-transit stages to minimize downstream disruption?

10. What contractual terms, service-level agreements (SLAs), and penalties or incentives should be in place with suppliers and carriers to align performance with business needs and risk tolerance?

11. How can inventory policy (safety stock, cycle stock, decoupling inventory) be calibrated across the network to protect against demand spikes while minimizing obsolescence and carrying costs?

12. In what ways can sustainability and regulatory compliance (e.g., conflict minerals, electronic waste rules, carbon reporting) be embedded into supplier selection, assembly, and packaging decisions?

13. How should the organization model and prepare for multi-risk scenarios (simultaneous supplier disruption, port congestion, regulatory changes) to ensure continuity of supply?

14. What improvements to the quality inspection process (automated inspection, in-line testing, supplier quality audits) could reduce rework rates and shorten the loop back to assembly?

15. How can the packaging, labeling, and customs documentation processes be standardized or digitized to reduce customs clearance times across diverse regional regulatory regimes?

16. What mechanisms should be used to prioritize shipments (VIP/pre-orders versus mass retail) during capacity constraints, and how will such prioritization affect customer satisfaction and brand reputation?

17. How can supplier relationship management be structured to encourage supplier innovation (e.g., cost reduction, component redesign) while maintaining required quality and lead-time commitments?

18. What role should scenario-based financial modeling (cost-to-serve, margin impact under disruption) play in high-level decisions like sourcing changes, freight mix, or adding assembly capacity?

19. How should reverse logistics (warranty returns, repairs, recycling) be integrated into the supply chain design to minimize cost and environmental impact while preserving customer experience?

20. How will governance and escalation pathways be defined for cross-functional decisions that require trade-offs between procurement, manufacturing, sales, legal/compliance, and finance?
