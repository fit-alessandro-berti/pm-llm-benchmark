**Explanation of Time Estimates:**

The estimated average times and standard deviations are based on a reasonable understanding of the supply chain process. Here's a breakdown:

* **Supplier Selection to Order Placement (SS->OP):**  Likely takes a couple of days for finalizing agreements and generating orders. There might be some standard deviation based on supplier response time.
* **Supplier Selection to Receive Components (SS->RC):** Takes longer as components need to be manufactured and shipped; standard deviation is higher due to supplier variations.
* **Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection (SS->QI):**  The component need to be received and then quality is checked, so a similar delay to RC but slightly longer given the extra step. Standard deviation is slightly higher than RC.
* **Supplier Selection to Component Assembly (SS->CA):** This is even further down the line, with an expected higher average and standard deviation.
* **Order Placement to Receive Components (OP->RC):**  Takes around a week as supplier processes the order, manufactures, and ships, with deviations based on supplier performance.
* **Order Placement to Quality Inspection (OP->QI):** Slightly longer than Order Placement to RC, as it include the time for inspection.
* **Order Placement to Component Assembly (OP->CA):** Expected to take a little over a week, given delays to the time of receiving components and then the actual assembly step.
* **Receive Components to Quality Inspection (RC->QI):** Relatively short, as the inspection should follow soon after reception, with a small deviation due to possible queue times in inspection.
* **Receive Components to Component Assembly (RC->CA):** Takes some time to be properly staged for assembly, and is expected to have a reasonable standard deviation.
* **Receive Components to Product Testing (RC->PT):** Expected to be longer that the previous pair, as it involves the time to receive the components, assembly and then the test.
* **Quality Inspection to Component Assembly (QI->CA):**  After inspection, components are moved to assembly. Assembly itself can take 3 days on average.
* **Quality Inspection to Product Testing (QI->PT):** Given that component quality is checked first, product testing is the next step, and it is expected to take longer than just component assembly.
* **Component Assembly to Product Testing (CA->PT):**  Testing is likely the next step after assembly with a relatively shorter delay, with a shorter deviation as well.
* **Component Assembly to Packaging (CA->PK):** It includes the time of the test and assembly; packaging can take a little over 3 days.
* **Product Testing to Packaging (PT->PK):**  Takes a day, as packaging should follow after successful testing. Standard deviation is lower due to a well-defined process.
* **Product Testing to Warehouse Storage (PT->WS):** Expected to take couple of days to prepare all necessary documentation and movement to storage.
* **Packaging to Warehouse Storage (PK->WS):** Expected to take one day for logistic and movement.
* **Packaging to Distribution (PK->DT):**  It takes several days for logistic before the final distribution
* **Warehouse Storage to Distribution (WS->DT):**  Takes two days to be picked and shipped. Deviation depends on logistic process.
* **Warehouse Storage to After-Sales Support (WS->AS):** It can be several days later, with a considerable delay before the final customers start asking for help.
* **Distribution to After-Sales Support (DT->AS):** Support might be needed some time after distribution; estimated to be within a month with variation based on the product's life cycle and usage.

This dictionary now represents the temporal profile, with estimated average and standard deviation times for the given activity pairs in a realistic supply chain scenario. The values are measured in seconds.
