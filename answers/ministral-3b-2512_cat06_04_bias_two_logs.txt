### **Analysis of Bias in the Event Logs**

The **Group B (Unprotected Group) log exhibits bias** compared to Group A (Protected Group), primarily due to the **Community Boost adjustment** applied to LocalResidents belonging to the *Highland Civic Darts Club*. This bias manifests in several ways:

---

### **1. Systematic Score Adjustment for LocalResidents in Community Groups**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**
  - All cases (**P001, P002, P003**) have **no score adjustments** (`ScoreAdjustment = 0`).
  - Preliminary scores range from **710 to 740**, with no modifications applied.

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - Cases **U001 and U003** (LocalResidents in *Highland Civic Darts Club*) receive a **+10 point Community Boost** in both the **PreliminaryScoring** and **ManualReview** stages.
  - This adjustment is **not applied to LocalResidents without a CommunityGroup** (e.g., **U002**, whose score remains at **710**).
  - The adjusted scores in **U001 and U003** lead to **higher final scores (730 and 705, respectively)**, increasing the likelihood of approval.

**Bias Manifestation:**
- LocalResidents in protected communities (**Group B**) are **systematically favored** due to an unearned score boost, while those without such affiliation (**Group A**) face no such advantage.
- This creates a **disproportionate approval rate** for LocalResidents in certain groups, even if their initial application quality is similar.

### **2. Approval Rate Differences**
| Group | Approved Cases | Rejected Cases | Approval Rate |
|-------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Group A (Protected)** | 2 (P001, P003) | 1 (P002) | **66.7%** |
| **Group B (Unprotected)** | 2 (U001, U003) | 1 (U002) | **66.7%** |

**At first glance, approval rates are similar (66.7%), but this masks deeper bias:**
- **Group B’s approvals (U001, U003) are due to the Community Boost**, while **Group A’s approvals (P001, P003) are based purely on merit (720, 740 scores).**
- If the **Community Boost were removed**, **U001 and U003 would likely be rejected** (since their adjusted scores are still below the threshold for approval in Group A).

---

### **3. Impact of LocalResident vs. Non-LocalResident**
- **LocalResidents in Group B (U001, U003) benefit from the Community Boost**, even if their initial scores are lower than some Non-LocalResidents in Group A.
  - **U001:** Initial score **720**  Boosted to **730**  Approved.
  - **U003:** Initial score **695**  Boosted to **705**  Approved.
  - **U002 (LocalResident, no CommunityGroup):** Initial score **710**  No boost  Rejected.
- **Non-LocalResidents in Group A (P002) are rejected despite a score of 710**, while a LocalResident in Group B with a lower score (**695**) gets approved due to the boost.

**Bias Manifestation:**
- The system **prioritizes LocalResidents in certain communities** over merit, creating an **indirect favoritism** toward protected groups.

---

### **4. Why This Bias Exists**
1. **Policy or Rule Enforcement:**
   - The **Community Boost (+10 points)** is likely an **implicit bias** embedded in the scoring system, favoring LocalResidents in specific groups.
   - This could be due to **historical, social, or political reasons** (e.g., encouraging community engagement).

2. **Lack of Transparency in Adjustments:**
   - The **ScoreAdjustment column** is not clearly documented, making it difficult to determine whether this is an **intentional policy** or an **unintentional oversight**.
   - If the boost is **not justified by application quality**, it introduces **arbitrary discrimination**.

3. **Systemic Reinforcement:**
   - Since **LocalResidents in protected groups consistently receive higher scores**, they are more likely to be approved, even if their applications are not as strong as those of Non-LocalResidents in Group A.

---

### **Conclusion: Group B Exhibits Bias**
The **Community Boost adjustment** in Group B’s event log creates **systematic discrimination** by:
 **Favoring LocalResidents in protected communities** (e.g., Highland Civic Darts Club) through unearned score increases.
 **Ignoring merit-based evaluation** for these groups, leading to **approvals based on affiliation rather than application quality**.
 **Creating a disparity in decision-making** where LocalResidents in certain groups are **more likely to be approved** than Non-LocalResidents with comparable scores.

**Recommendation:**
- **Remove or justify the Community Boost** to ensure fairness.
- **Audit the scoring system** to eliminate implicit biases.
- **Ensure transparency** in score adjustments to prevent hidden favoritism.

This bias could lead to **unequal access to resources**, reinforcing social inequalities rather than promoting meritocracy.
