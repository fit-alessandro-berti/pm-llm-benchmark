**Justification of Naming Choices:**

- **Document Verification (Initial)**: This is the first check done by the BackOfficeAgent, which is crucial at the beginning of the process. The word "Initial" clarifies that this is the first of several document verifications.

- **Customer Contact (First Attempt)**: This clarifies that the agent is making an initial contact attempt to clarify any issues.

- **Document Upload**: This represents the action where the customer uploads the requested document after being contacted.

- **Document Verification (Second)**: This indicates a re-check of the documents after the customer has uploaded the missing documents.

- **Customer Contact (Follow-Up)**: This denotes a call made to the customer to confirm that the adjustments have been made correctly.

- **Account Correction**: This describes the internal action taken to correct discrepancies in the account after the phone call with the customer.

These renamed activities provide clear context and disambiguation for each step in the process, making it easier to understand the sequence of events and roles involved.
