Let's go through this step-by-step!

**Analysis:**

We can identify several activities that appear multiple times within cases, with varying meanings:

1. **Verify Documents:** This activity appears in all three cases. Initially, it signifies a basic identity verification check. However, the second occurrence (in case C001) indicates a re-check after receiving additional information (the ID scan), suggesting a more thorough verification process. In case C003, it's used for physical verification at a branch.

2. **Call Customer:** This activity is also repeated within cases. The first instance in each case typically signifies an initial contact to gather necessary information or address issues. In cases C001 and C002, subsequent calls follow adjustments made during the call, indicating follow-ups.

3. **Submit Additional:**  Apperas once per case, referring to the customer uploading requested documents (ID scan in C001).

**Renamed Activities:**

* **Verify Documents (Case C001):** Re-verify Documents -  Indicates re-checking after receiving additional information.
* **Verify Documents (Cases C002 & C003):** Physical Verification - Highlights the physical verification process at a branch.
* **Call Customer (All Cases):** Initial Contact Call - Emphasizes the initial purpose of the call for information gathering or addressing issues.
* **Submit Additional (All Cases):** Upload Requested Documents - Clearly states the action taken by the customer.

* **Call Customer (Cases C001 & C002):** Follow-up Adjustment Call - Reflects the follow-up nature of the call after adjustments were made.

**Justification:**

The renaming focuses on clearly expressing the activity's role in the process flow and its specific context within each case. This ensures that the log is more informative, enabling better understanding of the workflow and its variations across different scenarios.
