Explanation of Transformation Logic
Case Identification:
Cases are defined based on the specific document, file, or task the user is working on at a given time. Each unique document or application context (e.g., an email thread, a PDF, a spreadsheet) is treated as a separate case. This approach ensures that events are grouped into meaningful units of work:
Case_Document1: Activities related to "Document1.docx".
Case_Email: Activities related to email handling in "Email - Inbox".
Case_Report_PDF: Activities related to "Report_Draft.pdf".
Case_Budget: Activities related to "Budget_2024.xlsx".
Case_Quarterly: Activities related to "Quarterly_Report.docx".
The initial "FOCUS" on "Quarterly_Report.docx" at 08:59:50 was not followed by further activity, so it was not included as a case until the user returned to it later.
Activity Naming:
Raw actions like "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SWITCH," "CLICK," etc., were translated into higher-level, standardized activities that reflect process steps:
"FOCUS" or "SWITCH" to a new document/file → "Start Document Editing," "Open Document," or "Resume Document Editing."
"TYPING" → "Edit Document," "Compose Email," or "Edit Spreadsheet" depending on context.
"SAVE" → "Save Document" or "Save Spreadsheet."
"SCROLL" → "Review Document" or "Review Email."
"HIGHLIGHT" → "Annotate Document."
"CLOSE" → "Complete Document Editing."
Email-specific actions (e.g., "CLICK" to open or reply) → "Open Email," "Reply to Email," "Send Email."
This abstraction makes the event log more analyst-friendly and suitable for process discovery.
Event Attributes:
Case ID: Assigned based on the document/file being worked on.
Activity Name: Descriptive and standardized as described above.
Timestamp: Retained from the original log.
Additional Attributes: Included "Application," "Document/File," and "Details" to provide context for analysis (e.g., what was typed or clicked).
Coherent Narrative:
The event log captures distinct user tasks: editing "Document1.docx," handling an email, reviewing a PDF, updating a spreadsheet, and drafting a quarterly report. Transitions between tasks (e.g., switching apps) are used to mark the start or resumption of cases, creating a clear story of the user’s workflow.
This transformation ensures the event log is ready for process mining tools like Celonis, Disco, or ProM, enabling analysts to study task sequences, durations, and transitions effectively.
