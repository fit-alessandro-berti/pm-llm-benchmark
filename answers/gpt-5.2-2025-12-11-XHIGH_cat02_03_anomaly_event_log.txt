### What a “normal” P2P sequence looks like (simplified)
**Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  Receive Goods (GR)  Receive Invoice  2/3way match  Release Payment  Close**

(Invoice can sometimes arrive before goods, but **payment is normally after approval + receipt + successful match**.)

## Case-by-case anomalies

### Case **1001** (looks compliant)
Sequence follows the standard pattern: PR created/approved  PO issued  goods received  invoice received  match  payment  close.  
No obvious red flags.

---

### Case **1002** (multiple, serious control bypasses)
**Observed order:** Create PR  **Issue PO**  Invoice received  **Release payment**  **Approve PR**  Receive goods  Match invoice  Close

**Why it’s anomalous/problematic**
- **PO issued before PR approval**  
  Suggests procurement happened without authorization/budget approval (or approval was done retroactively).
- **Payment released before PR approval, before goods receipt, and before invoice matching**  
  This breaks core P2P controls (especially 3way matching). Risks include:
  - paying for goods/services not received,
  - paying incorrect prices/quantities,
  - fraud (e.g., paying an invoice for an unauthorized PO),
  - weak auditability (controls performed after money left).
- **Match occurs after payment**  
  Matching becomes a “post-check” rather than a preventive control.

---

### Case **1003** (payment made before any obligation is validated)
**Observed order:** Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  **Release payment**  Invoice received  Receive goods  Match  Close

**Why it’s anomalous/problematic**
- **Payment released before invoice is received**  
  In standard P2P, payment is triggered by an approved/validated invoice. Paying first looks like an unrecorded prepayment.
- **Payment also occurs before goods receipt and before match**  
  Again bypasses 3way match controls. Risks:
  - prepaying and then never receiving goods,
  - reduced leverage to resolve disputes (quality/quantity),
  - potential for duplicate invoices/payments later (since invoice arrives after payment).

(There are legitimate scenarios like deposits/advance payments, but those usually have distinct steps/flags and stronger approval controls.)

---

### Case **1004** (goods received before a PO exists)
**Observed order:** Create PR  Approve PR  **Receive goods**  Issue PO  Invoice received  Match  Payment  Close

**Why it’s anomalous/problematic**
- **Goods receipt before PO issuance**  
  Typically you should not receive against “nothing.” This may indicate:
  - “after-the-fact” PO creation to legitimize an off-contract or unauthorized purchase,
  - maverick spending (bypassing purchasing),
  - weakened ability to enforce agreed price/terms because the supplier delivered before a formal order.
- Secondary concern: invoice  match  payment happens very quickly the same morning, which can be fine (automation), but combined with the GR-before-PO pattern can indicate rushed/low scrutiny processing.

---

## Summary of anomalies to flag
- **Unauthorized or retroactive approvals:** 1002 (approval after PO and after payment)
- **Payment before key validations (receipt/match/invoice):** 1002 and 1003
- **Receiving goods without an issued PO:** 1004

These patterns are problematic because they undermine the preventive controls (authorization and 3way match) that P2P is designed to enforce, increasing risk of fraud, overpayment, and paying for goods/services not received.
