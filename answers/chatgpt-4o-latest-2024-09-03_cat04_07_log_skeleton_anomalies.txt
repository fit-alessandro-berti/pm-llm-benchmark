The process model that you provided illustrates a complex set of declarative constraints governing the occurrence and ordering of various activities. Several constraints interrelate, such as Equivalence, Always Before, Always After, Never Together, Activity Occurrences, and Directly-Follows Constraints. By analyzing these constraints, we can identify potential contradictions, inconsistencies, or anomalies in the model.

### 1. **Conflicting Relations: Equivalence and Activity Occurrence**  
   - **Equivalence Constraint**:  
     For instance, consider the equivalence constraints: 
     - `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'` is equivalent to `'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'` and `'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER'`.  

     However, under the **Activity Occurrences** constraints:
     - `'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'` is constrained to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` occurrences in a case.
     - `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'` is restricted to `[0, 1]` occurrences.

     An equivalence constraint implies both activities should occur the same number of times. However, `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'` is limited to maximum 1 occurrence, while `'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'` can occur up to 4 times. This is clearly an anomaly and inconsistency between the equivalent constraint and activity occurrence bounds.

### 2. **Contradicting Always Before and Equivalence Constraints**  
   - **Always Before Constraint**:  
     According to the Always Before constraint:  
     - `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'` must occur before (i.e., can only happen after) `'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'`.

     However:
     - There's an **Equivalence Constraint** between `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'` and `'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'`, which implies they should happen the same number of times in the process.

     Having both constraints seems contradictory:
     - If two activities are equivalent, they should occur together in the same case with the same frequency. However, placing an "Always Before" constraint between them essentially implies that one must happen before, which contradicts the essence of equivalence.

### 3. **Contradiction in "Never Together" and Activity Occurrence**  
   - **Never Together Constraint**:  
     - `'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'` is marked to Never occur together with `'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE'`.

     However, under Activity Occurrences:
     - `'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE'` can occur between `[0, 6]` times.
     - `'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'` can occur between `[0, 1]` times.

     Given that `'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE'` can occur multiple times, it seems unrealistic to enforce that it never occurs together with `'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'`, especially in scenarios where multiple rejection states may exist in complex or repeated workflows.

### 4. **"Always After" vs. "Directly-Follows" Constraint Inconsistency**  
   - **Always After Constraint**:
     - `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'` must be always after `'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'`.
     
     However:
     - The Directly-Follows constraint indicates that `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'` must directly follow `'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'` as well.

     This isn't exactly an issue, but there’s potential redundancy here. If you have a strict **Directly-Follows** constraint (which ensures direct succession), it’s unnecessary to include a broader **Always After** constraint, as the former inherently encompasses situations where one activity must follow another.

### 5. **Mutual Conflicts in "Never Together"**  
   A few of the "Never Together" constraints seem mutually exclusive:
   - `'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION'` cannot be together with `'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'`, and neither can `'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'` be together with `'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE'`.  
   
     However, `'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE'` is allowed to coexist with `'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION'`, which could lead to circular relationships and combinations that break one of the other "Never Together" constraints.  
     
     These might not show up as clear contradictions but instead as challenges when performing conformance checking (potential deadlocks or cases where no feasible process path can result).

### 6. **Number of Occurrences Contradictions**  
   - In the Equivalence constraints:  
     `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'` is equivalent to multiple other declarations that have different possibility ranges in terms of occurrences.
     - For example, `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'` has `[0, 1]` occurrences.
     - `'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER'` may have `[0, 1, 2]` occurrences.
   
     This creates a clear contradiction — how can two declarations be mutually equivalent when they have mismatching potential upper bounds in their occurrences? This anomaly clearly breaks from the intended equivalence rule.

### 7. **Conflicting Process Flow Definitions**  
   - The combination of **Directly-Follows**, **Always Before**, and **Never Together** constraints may, in some conditions, create infeasible paths. For example:
     - `"Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR"` must always happen after `"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"`, but at the same time, "'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'" cannot be "Sometimes Together" with various other activities such as rejections, approvals, or even some prior declaration states.

These combinations could result in conflicts in actual execution, especially when conformance checking real data logs.

#### **In Summary:**
The process model you're working with has several areas with potential anomalies:
1. **Contradictions between Equivalence and Activity Occurrences**.
2. **Conflicting constraints between Always Before and Equivalence**.
3. **Never Together constraints and Activity Occurrences presenting infeasibilities**.
4. **Potential redundancies in Always After and Directly-Follows**.
5. **"Never Together" conflicts creating a lack of feasible process flows**.

These issues would need to be adjusted to avoid logical contradictions in the process flow, making the process model more coherent.
