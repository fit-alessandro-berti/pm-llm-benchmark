The diagram presents a high-level overview of a credit scoring process, which is divided into two main components: the Credit Scoring Agent (upper part) and the Scoring Service (lower part). The flow begins with the credit scoring request being received by the Credit Scoring Agent, which then forwards this request to the Scoring Service. The Scoring Service initiates the process by computing the credit score at level 1. If a valid score is obtained, it is sent back to the Credit Scoring Agent. If no valid score is found, the service delays the request and proceeds to compute the credit score at level 2. Upon obtaining a valid score at level 2, it is sent back to the Credit Scoring Agent. The Credit Scoring Agent subsequently sends the credit score back to the requester. Dashed lines represent scenarios where reports are requested and received, indicating that this step is optional and not always required. The overall concept conveyed by the diagram is the systematic process of requesting and computing credit scores, handling delays, and reporting results, illustrating a structured approach to credit scoring management.
