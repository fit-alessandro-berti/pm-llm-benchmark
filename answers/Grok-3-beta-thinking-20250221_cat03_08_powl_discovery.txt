<think>
Okay, I need to create a POWL model based on this event log. Let's start by understanding the process flow and identifying the key activities and their relationships.

First, let's list all the unique activities from the event log:

OR: Order Received
MS: Material Sourcing
QS: Quality Screening
AS: Assembly
IQC: In-line Quality Check
TST: Testing
RT: Re-Testing
PK: Packaging
LB: Labeling
DP: Distribution Planning
D: Dispatch
Now, I need to observe the sequences in which these activities occur across different cases to identify patterns, loops, choices, and partial orders.

Looking at Case 1:

OR -> MS -> QS -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST -> RT -> TST -> PK -> LB -> DP -> D

Here, after AS, there's IQC, then AS again, suggesting a loop involving AS and IQC. Then, after TST, there's RT followed by TST again, indicating another loop for testing and re-testing.

Similarly, in Case 2:

OR -> MS -> QS -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST -> PK -> DP -> D

Here, LB is skipped, so there's a choice whether to do LB or not.

In Case 3:

OR -> MS -> QS -> AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST -> RT -> TST -> PK -> LB -> DP -> D

More instances of IQC and AS, reinforcing the loop idea. Also, RT and TST loop.

Case 4:

OR -> MS -> QS -> AS -> TST -> PK -> LB -> DP -> D

No IQC or RT, a simpler path without loops.

Case 5:

OR -> MS -> QS -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST -> RT -> TST -> RT -> TST -> PK -> LB -> DP -> D

Again, loops with IQC and AS, and multiple RT and TST.

From these observations, I can identify the following patterns:

The process always starts with OR, followed by MS, then QS.
After QS, there's AS, which may be followed by IQC and then AS again, forming a loop. This loop can be executed multiple times or skipped entirely (as in Case 4).
After the AS-IQC loop, there's TST, which may be followed by RT and then TST again, forming another loop. This loop can also be executed multiple times or skipped.
After the TST-RT loop, there's PK.
After PK, there's a choice: either LB or skip LB.
Finally, DP and D.
Wait, actually, in Case 2, after PK, it goes directly to DP without LB, so yes, there's a choice to do LB or skip it.

Also, in all cases, DP is followed by D.

Now, let's think about how to model this with POWL.

First, the initial sequence: OR -> MS -> QS.

Then, there's a loop involving AS and IQC. Specifically, it's a loop where you do AS, then optionally do IQC and repeat AS, and so on, until you decide to exit the loop.

Wait, actually, looking at the traces, it seems that after QS, you do AS, then possibly IQC, then AS again, and so on. So, it's a loop where you can do AS, then either proceed or do IQC and then AS again.

But in POWL, the loop operator is defined as *(A, B), which means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again, repeating until exit.

So, for the AS-IQC loop, it seems that A would be AS, and B would be IQC, meaning: do AS, then either exit the loop or do IQC and then AS again, and so on.

Wait, but in the traces, sometimes there is no IQC at all, like in Case 4, where after QS, it's AS -> TST, so no IQC.

Wait, actually, in Case 4, after AS, it directly goes to TST, so the loop is optional.

Wait, but in POWL, the loop *(A, B) always starts with A, and then can exit or do B and then A again.

But in this process, it seems that the loop can be skipped entirely, meaning that after QS, you can choose to do the AS-IQC loop or directly go to TST.

Wait, but looking at the traces, in Case 4, there is AS before TST, so it's not skipping the loop entirely, but rather doing AS once without IQC.

Wait, in the loop *(AS, IQC), it would mean: do AS, then either exit or do IQC and then AS again, and so on.

So, if you do AS and then exit, that would correspond to doing AS once without IQC, which matches Case 4.

In other cases, like Case 1, it's AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST, which is doing AS, then IQC, then AS again, and then exit.

Wait, but in the loop *(AS, IQC), after doing AS, you can choose to do IQC and then AS again, but in the trace, after the second AS, it goes to TST, so it's like doing AS, then IQC, then AS, then exit.

But in the loop definition, after doing A (AS), you can choose to exit or do B (IQC) and then A again.

So, in this case, it's do AS, then do IQC, then do AS again, then exit.

Wait, actually, in the loop *(A, B), the execution is: start with A, then repeatedly do B then A, until you decide to exit after A.

Wait, more precisely, in POWL, the loop *(A, B) means: execute A, then you have a choice: either exit the loop or execute B and then go back to A, and so on.

So, the possible executions are: A, or A then B then A, or A then B then A then B then A, etc.

In all cases, it starts with A and ends with A.

In the traces, for example, in Case 1: AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST, which can be seen as A then B then A, then exit after the second A.

Similarly, in Case 3: AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST, but wait, there are two IQC in a row, which doesn't fit directly.

Wait, in Case 3: AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST.

Hmm, there are two IQC consecutively, which suggests that perhaps IQC can be repeated.

Wait, maybe the loop is not directly *(AS, IQC), but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each IQC is associated with an AS, but in the trace, it's AS -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS, etc.

Wait, actually, in Case 1: AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST, so AS, then IQC, then AS, then TST.

Similarly, in Case 3: AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST, but that has two IQC in a row, which is unusual.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo or an error in the event log. Typically, in such processes, IQC is done after AS, and if it fails, you do AS again, and so on.

But in the trace, it's AS -> IQC -> AS, which fits, but in Case 3, AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS, with two IQC, which might indicate that IQC can be repeated, but that seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps each AS is followed by IQC, and you can do multiple AS each followed by IQC.

For example, in Case 3, it could be interpreted as AS -> IQC, then AS -> IQC, then AS -> TST, but in the trace, it's AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST, which doesn't directly match.

Wait, perhaps it's that after AS, you do IQC, and then decide whether to do AS again or proceed.

But in the trace, after AS, it's IQC, then possibly another IQC, which is confusing.

Wait, let's look closely at Case 3:

AS at 10:00
IQC at 10:15
IQC at 10:30
AS at 10:45
IQC at 11:00
AS at 11:15
TST at 11:45
So, it's AS, then two IQC, then AS, then IQC, then AS, then TST.

This suggests that after AS, there might be multiple IQC checks, and then you can do AS again.

But that seems unusual. Typically, IQC would be done after AS, and based on the result, you might need to redo AS.

Perhaps in this process, multiple IQC checks are performed after AS, and then you decide whether to redo AS or proceed.

But to simplify, maybe we can model it as a loop where you do AS followed by one or more IQC, and then either exit or do AS again.

But in POWL, it's not straightforward to model "one or more IQC".

Alternatively, perhaps each AS is followed by zero or more IQC, and then you can choose to do another AS or proceed.

But again, the traces show IQC after AS, and sometimes multiple IQC.

Wait, another idea: perhaps IQC is part of a loop with AS, but in a different way.

For example, maybe it's a loop where you do AS, then IQC, and then decide whether to repeat AS or exit.

But in the traces, sometimes there are multiple IQC after AS, like in Case 3.

Wait, perhaps the process allows for multiple IQC after AS, and then you can choose to do AS again or proceed to TST.

So, for each AS, you can do zero or more IQC, and then either do another AS or go to TST.

But in the traces, in Case 1: AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST, so after the first AS, one IQC, then another AS, then TST.

In Case 3: AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST, so after the first AS, two IQC, then another AS, then one IQC, then another AS, then TST.

This is irregular. Perhaps the event log has some errors, or perhaps IQC can be performed multiple times after AS.

To make it simple, let's assume that after AS, there can be one or more IQC, and then you can choose to do AS again or proceed to TST.

But in POWL, it's hard to model "one or more IQC".

Alternatively, maybe each IQC is associated with a separate AS, but the traces don't support that directly.

Another perspective: perhaps the process has a loop for assembly and quality check, where you do AS, then IQC, and based on IQC, you may need to redo AS.

But in the traces, sometimes there are multiple IQC after AS, which might indicate that IQC can be repeated until it passes, and then you proceed.

For example, in Case 3: AS -> IQC -> IQC, perhaps the first IQC failed, so another IQC was done, and then it passed, so proceeded to AS again.

But actually, after the two IQC, it's AS again, so it's not clear.

Wait, maybe it's that after AS, you do IQC, and if it fails, you do IQC again, and so on, until it passes, and then you can choose to do another AS or proceed.

But in the trace, after AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS, so after two IQC, it goes to AS again, which suggests that even after multiple IQC, you might still need to do AS again.

This is confusing. Perhaps for the sake of modeling, I can simplify and assume that after AS, there is a choice to do IQC and then AS again, or proceed to TST.

So, like a loop *(AS, IQC), but that would be do AS, then either exit or do IQC and then AS again, but in the traces, it's AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST, which fits as AS, then IQC, then AS, then exit after the second AS.

But in Case 3, it's AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST, which doesn't fit directly, as there are two IQC in a row.

Perhaps I can model IQC as a separate activity that can be repeated, but it's not ideal.

Alternatively, maybe consider that IQC can be done multiple times after AS, but for POWL, it's challenging.

To keep it manageable, let's approximate the model by having a loop for AS and IQC, where you do AS, then optionally do IQC and repeat AS, etc.

So, using *(AS, IQC), meaning do AS, then either exit or do IQC and then AS again, and so on.

Then, in Case 1, it would be AS -> IQC -> AS -> exit, but actually, after the second AS, it goes to TST, so it's like doing the loop twice.

Similarly, in Case 3, it's more complex, but perhaps we can accept that sometimes there are multiple IQC, but for the model, we approximate it as *(AS, IQC).

Alternatively, another way: perhaps the loop is *(AS followed by IQC), but in POWL, loops are between two sub-models.

Wait, actually, in POWL, the loop operator is between two POWL models, A and B, where you do A, then either exit or do B and then A again.

So, if I want to model a loop where you do AS followed by IQC repeatedly, I could set A = sequence of AS then IQC, and B = something, but it's not straightforward.

Wait, for example, to model doing (AS -> IQC) one or more times, I could use a loop with A = AS -> IQC, and B = skip, but since B is skip, it's basically doing A one or more times.

But in POWL, the loop *(A, B) with B=silent transition would allow doing A, then possibly B (skip) and A again, but since B is skip, it's effectively allowing multiple A's.

Wait, actually, in POWL, if B is a silent transition, then *(A, B) would allow doing A, then either exit or do skip and then A again, so effectively, it's A one or more times.

But in this case, A would be AS -> IQC, so *(AS -> IQC, skip), which would allow (AS -> IQC) one or more times.

But in the traces, sometimes it's AS without IQC, like in Case 4: AS -> TST, so no IQC.

So, if I model it as *(AS -> IQC, skip), it would require at least one (AS -> IQC), but in Case 4, there is AS but no IQC.

Wait, unless I make it optional, but in POWL, the loop always starts with A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a choice between doing the loop or skipping it.

For example, X( *(AS -> IQC, skip), skip), so either do the loop of (AS -> IQC) one or more times, or skip it entirely.

But in the traces, even in Case 4, there is AS before TST, so it's not skipping the entire loop, but rather doing AS without IQC.

So, perhaps it's better to model it as doing AS, then possibly doing IQC and AS again, etc.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the process is: do AS, then either proceed to TST or do IQC and then AS again.

So, it's like a loop where after AS, you can choose to do IQC and then AS again, or exit to TST.

But in POWL, that would be *(AS, IQC), since after AS, you can choose to do IQC and then AS again, or exit.

But in the traces, when you exit, you go to TST, so the exit leads to TST.

Similarly, for the testing part, after TST, you can choose to do RT and then TST again, or exit to PK.

So, that would be *(TST, RT).

Then, for the labeling, after PK, there is a choice to do LB or skip it, then DP and D.

So, let's try to structure the entire process.

First, the process starts with OR -> MS -> QS.

Then, after QS, there is the AS-IQC loop: *(AS, IQC), meaning do AS, then either proceed to the next part or do IQC and then AS again, and so on.

Then, after exiting the AS-IQC loop, there is the TST-RT loop: *(TST, RT), meaning do TST, then either proceed or do RT and then TST again, and so on.

Then, after exiting the TST-RT loop, there is PK, then a choice between LB or skip, then DP -> D.

So, in POWL, I can model this as a partial order where the nodes are:

The sequence OR -> MS -> QS
The loop *(AS, IQC)
The loop *(TST, RT)
PK
The choice X(LB, skip)
DP
D
And the order is that the sequence OR -> MS -> QS precedes the AS-IQC loop, which precedes the TST-RT loop, which precedes PK, which precedes the choice, which precedes DP, which precedes D.

Wait, more precisely, since it's a partial order, I can set the order such that:

OR -> MS -> QS is the starting point
Then, the AS-IQC loop depends on QS
Then, the TST-RT loop depends on the AS-IQC loop
Then, PK depends on the TST-RT loop
Then, the choice X(LB, skip) depends on PK
Then, DP depends on the choice
Then, D depends on DP
Also, since OR -> MS -> QS is a sequence, I need to model it appropriately.

Actually, in POWL, I can have a partial order where the nodes are individual activities or sub-models.

So, for the initial part, I can have OR, MS, QS as separate nodes with order OR -> MS -> QS.

Then, the AS-IQC loop as a node, with order QS -> AS-IQC loop.

Then, the TST-RT loop as a node, with order AS-IQC loop -> TST-RT loop.

Then, PK as a node, with order TST-RT loop -> PK.

Then, the choice X(LB, skip) as a node, with order PK -> choice.

Then, DP as a node, with order choice -> DP.

Then, D as a node, with order DP -> D.

Additionally, since all these are in sequence, there are no concurrent activities in this process, as far as I can see from the event log.

So, the entire process can be modeled as a strict partial order with nodes: OR, MS, QS, loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT, PK, choice_LB, DP, D, with the order: OR -> MS -> QS -> loop_AS_IQC -> loop_TST_RT -> PK -> choice_LB -> DP -> D.

Wait, but actually, since the loops and choices are sub-models, I need to define them properly.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, define the loop for AS and IQC: loop_AS_IQC = *(AS, IQC)

Similarly, loop_TST_RT = *(TST, RT)

Then, the choice for LB: choice_LB = X(LB, skip), where skip is a silent transition.

Then, the main structure is a partial order with nodes: OR, MS, QS, loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT, PK, choice_LB, DP, D, and the order is OR -> MS -> QS -> loop_AS_IQC -> loop_TST_RT -> PK -> choice_LB -> DP -> D.

But wait, in POWL, the partial order can have sub-models as nodes, so yes, I can have loop_AS_IQC as a node, etc.

Alternatively, since the process is essentially a sequence of these sub-models, I could also model it as a sequence, but in POWL, sequences are not directly supported, but can be represented as a partial order with a total order.

So, to be precise, I can define a StrictPartialOrder with nodes = [OR, MS, QS, loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT, PK, choice_LB, DP, D], and add edges OR -> MS, MS -> QS, QS -> loop_AS_IQC, loop_AS_IQC -> loop_TST_RT, loop_TST_RT -> PK, PK -> choice_LB, choice_LB -> DP, DP -> D.

That should capture the entire process.

Now, to implement this in code, I need to create the transitions and the sub-models.

First, create the transitions:

OR = Transition(label="OR")

MS = Transition(label="MS")

QS = Transition(label="QS")

AS = Transition(label="AS")

IQC = Transition(label="IQC")

TST = Transition(label="TST")

RT = Transition(label="RT")

PK = Transition(label="PK")

LB = Transition(label="LB")

DP = Transition(label="DP")

D = Transition(label="D")

skip = SilentTransition()

Then, create the loops:

loop_AS_IQC = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])

loop_TST_RT = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

Then, create the choice:

choice_LB = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

Then, create the partial order:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT, PK, choice_LB, DP, D])

Then, add the edges:

root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)

root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)

root.order.add_edge(QS, loop_AS_IQC)

root.order.add_edge(loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT)

root.order.add_edge(loop_TST_RT, PK)

root.order.add_edge(PK, choice_LB)

root.order.add_edge(choice_LB, DP)

root.order.add_edge(DP, D)

This seems to capture the process as described.

Wait, but in the event log, in some cases, like Case 4, there is AS without IQC, which in the loop *(AS, IQC), you can do AS and then exit without doing IQC, but actually, in the loop definition, after doing AS, you can choose to exit, which would mean after AS, you can go directly to the next part, which is loop_TST_RT, i.e., TST.

But in the trace, after AS, it's TST, so yes, that fits.

Similarly, in other cases, you can do AS -> IQC -> AS -> ... and then exit to TST.

So, this seems acceptable.

Regarding the multiple IQC in Case 3, perhaps it's an anomaly or a specific case where multiple checks were needed, but for the model, we can approximate it with the loop *(AS, IQC).

Alternatively, if I want to be more precise, I could model a sub-process where after AS, there is a choice to do IQC one or more times, but that would complicate the model, and since POWL doesn't directly support that, I'll stick with the simpler approximation.

Similarly, for the testing loop, *(TST, RT), it allows doing TST, then possibly RT and TST again, etc., which matches the traces where there are multiple RT and TST.

Finally, after PK, there is a choice to do LB or skip it, then DP and D.

So, I think this model captures the main aspects of the process.

Therefore, the final POWL model is as described above.

To summarize, the POWL model is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes:

OR
MS
QS
loop_AS_IQC = *(AS, IQC)
loop_TST_RT = *(TST, RT)
PK
choice_LB = X(LB, skip)
DP
D
With the order:

OR -> MS -> QS -> loop_AS_IQC -> loop_TST_RT -> PK -> choice_LB -> DP -> D

So, in code, it would be:

python
Wrap
Copy
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define loops
loop_AS_IQC = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])
loop_TST_RT = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Define choice
choice_LB = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

# Define partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT, PK, choice_LB, DP, D])

# Add edges
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, loop_AS_IQC)
root.order.add_edge(loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT)
root.order.add_edge(loop_TST_RT, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, choice_LB)
root.order.add_edge(choice_LB, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
This should represent the complex process described in the event log.
</think>

To create a POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) model for the given event log of a global manufacturing and distribution process, we analyze the sequences of activities across multiple cases to identify the process flow, including mandatory sequences, loops, and choices. The event log provides traces for five cases, each detailing activities such as Order Received (OR), Material Sourcing (MS), Assembly (AS), and Dispatch (D), among others. Below, we construct a POWL model that captures these relationships using transitions, loop operators, choice operators, and a strict partial order.

---

### Step 1: Identify Key Activities
The event log lists the following unique activities:
- **OR**: Order Received
- **MS**: Material Sourcing
- **QS**: Quality Screening
- **AS**: Assembly
- **IQC**: In-line Quality Check
- **TST**: Testing
- **RT**: Re-Testing
- **PK**: Packaging
- **LB**: Labeling
- **DP**: Distribution Planning
- **D**: Dispatch

Additionally, a silent transition (skip) will be used to model optional activities.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Process Flow and Patterns
By examining the event log across Cases 1 to 5, we identify the following patterns:

1. **Initial Sequence**: Every case begins with the sequence OR → MS → QS. This is a mandatory linear flow with no variation.
   - Example: Case 1: OR (08:00) → MS (08:30) → QS (09:00).

2. **Assembly and Quality Check Loop**: After QS, the process involves AS, which may be followed by IQC, and then AS again, forming a loop. This loop can:
   - Occur multiple times (e.g., Case 3: AS → IQC → IQC → AS → IQC → AS).
   - Occur once with IQC (e.g., Case 2: AS → IQC → AS).
   - Be minimal with just AS (e.g., Case 4: AS → TST, no IQC).
   - In POWL, the loop operator `*(A, B)` executes A, then allows a choice to exit or execute B followed by A again. Thus, we model this as `*(AS, IQC)`, where:
     - AS is performed, then either the loop exits to the next step (e.g., TST), or IQC is performed followed by AS again.
     - This accommodates Case 4 (AS then exit), Case 1 (AS → IQC → AS then exit), and approximates multiple IQCs (e.g., Case 3) by simplifying repeated IQCs into the loop structure.

3. **Testing and Re-Testing Loop**: After the AS-IQC loop, TST occurs, which may be followed by RT and then TST again, forming another loop. This loop can:
   - Occur multiple times (e.g., Case 5: TST → RT → TST → RT → TST).
   - Occur once (e.g., Case 1: TST → RT → TST).
   - Be skipped beyond the initial TST (e.g., Case 4: TST only).
   - We model this as `*(TST, RT)`, where TST is executed, then either the loop exits to PK, or RT is performed followed by TST again.

4. **Packaging and Labeling Choice**: After the TST-RT loop, PK is always performed. Then, there’s a choice:
   - Perform LB (e.g., Case 1: PK → LB).
   - Skip LB (e.g., Case 2: PK → DP).
   - We model this as `X(LB, skip)`, where `skip` is a silent transition, allowing LB to be optional.

5. **Final Sequence**: After the LB choice, every case ends with DP → D.
   - Example: Case 1: DP (12:30) → D (13:00).

6. **Concurrency**: The traces show no overlapping timestamps or evidence of parallel execution, suggesting a sequential process.

---

### Step 3: Construct the POWL Model
Based on the analysis, the process is a sequence of sub-models with no concurrency, which we represent as a `StrictPartialOrder` with a total order. The model includes:

- **Individual Transitions**: OR, MS, QS, PK, DP, D.
- **Loop Sub-Models**:
  - `loop_AS_IQC = *(AS, IQC)`: Captures the assembly and quality check loop.
  - `loop_TST_RT = *(TST, RT)`: Captures the testing and re-testing loop.
- **Choice Sub-Model**:
  - `choice_LB = X(LB, skip)`: Captures the optional labeling step.

The nodes are ordered sequentially to reflect the process flow:
- OR → MS → QS → loop_AS_IQC → loop_TST_RT → PK → choice_LB → DP → D.

---

### Final POWL Model
The POWL model is defined as follows:

- **Nodes**:
  - OR (Transition: "OR")
  - MS (Transition: "MS")
  - QS (Transition: "QS")
  - loop_AS_IQC = *(AS, IQC)
    - AS (Transition: "AS")
    - IQC (Transition: "IQC")
  - loop_TST_RT = *(TST, RT)
    - TST (Transition: "TST")
    - RT (Transition: "RT")
  - PK (Transition: "PK")
  - choice_LB = X(LB, skip)
    - LB (Transition: "LB")
    - skip (SilentTransition)
  - DP (Transition: "DP")
  - D (Transition: "D")

- **Order** (Edges in the StrictPartialOrder):
  - OR → MS
  - MS → QS
  - QS → loop_AS_IQC
  - loop_AS_IQC → loop_TST_RT
  - loop_TST_RT → PK
  - PK → choice_LB
  - choice_LB → DP
  - DP → D

This structure ensures:
- The process starts with OR, MS, QS in sequence.
- The AS-IQC loop allows multiple iterations or a single AS (exiting after AS without IQC, as in Case 4).
- The TST-RT loop accommodates re-testing as needed.
- The choice after PK allows LB to be performed or skipped.
- The process ends with DP and D.

---

### Verification with Event Log
- **Case 1**: OR → MS → QS → (AS → IQC → AS) → (TST → RT → TST) → PK → LB → DP → D
  - Matches: loop_AS_IQC (AS → IQC → AS then exit), loop_TST_RT (TST → RT → TST then exit), choice_LB (LB).
- **Case 2**: OR → MS → QS → (AS → IQC → AS) → TST → PK → DP → D
  - Matches: loop_AS_IQC (AS → IQC → AS then exit), loop_TST_RT (TST then exit), choice_LB (skip).
- **Case 3**: OR → MS → QS → (AS → IQC → IQC → AS → IQC → AS) → (TST → RT → TST) → PK → LB → DP → D
  - Approximates: loop_AS_IQC simplifies multiple IQCs (e.g., AS → IQC → AS → IQC → AS) as iterations, loop_TST_RT and choice_LB fit perfectly.
- **Case 4**: OR → MS → QS → AS → TST → PK → LB → DP → D
  - Matches: loop_AS_IQC (AS then exit), loop_TST_RT (TST then exit), choice_LB (LB).
- **Case 5**: OR → MS → QS → (AS → IQC → AS → IQC → AS) → (TST → RT → TST → RT → TST) → PK → LB → DP → D
  - Matches: loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT (multiple iterations), choice_LB (LB).

The model captures the main process flow, approximating rare cases like multiple consecutive IQCs (Case 3) within the loop structure for simplicity.

### Final Answer
The POWL model is a `StrictPartialOrder` with:
- **Nodes**: 
  - OR
  - MS
  - QS
  - loop_AS_IQC = *(AS, IQC)
  - loop_TST_RT = *(TST, RT)
  - PK
  - choice_LB = X(LB, skip)
  - DP
  - D
- **Order**: OR → MS → QS → loop_AS_IQC → loop_TST_RT → PK → choice_LB → DP → D

This model effectively represents the manufacturing and distribution process described in the event log.
