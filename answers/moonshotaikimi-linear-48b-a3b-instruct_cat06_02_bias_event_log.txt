### **Analysis of Bias in the Event Log Process**

#### **Key Observations:**
1. **Community Group Affiliation Triggers Additional Scoring Adjustments**
   - **C001 & C004** (both with "Highland Civic Darts Club" affiliation) received **+10 (Community)** adjustments.
   - **C002, C003, & C005** (no affiliation) received **0** adjustments.
   - This suggests that **community group members are systematically favored** in scoring.

2. **Final Decision Outcomes Favor Group-Affiliated Individuals**
   - **C001 & C004** (affiliated)  **Approved** (final scores: 720 & 700)
   - **C002, C005** (no affiliation)  **Approved** (final scores: 720 & 740)
   - **C003** (no affiliation)  **Rejected** (final score: 715)

3. **Hidden Bias in Manual Review**
   - **Reviewer assignments** (e.g., C001: Reviewer #7, C004: Reviewer #2) do not show explicit discriminatory behavior, but the **weighted scoring** (ascribed by the Scoring Engine + Community adjustment) may bias reviewers toward approval.

### **Where and How Bias Manifests**

#### **1. Scoring Engine & Community Adjustment Mechanism**
- The **+10 (Community)** bonus is **mechanically applied** to group-affiliated cases (C001, C004) but **not to non-affiliated cases** (C002, C003, C005).
  - **Problem**: This creates an **arbitrary advantage** for those in certain organizations, even if their creditworthiness is identical.
  - **Impact**: A non-affiliated applicant with a **715 score** (C003) is **rejected**, while a similarly scored affiliated applicant (C004: 700  adjusted to 710  final 720) is **approved**.

#### **2. Disparate Outcomes with Similar Profiles**
- **C001 (710  +10  720)**: Approved  
- **C003 (715  0  715)**: Rejected  
  - Despite C003 having a **higher initial score**, it is **rejected** due to the lack of community affiliation, while C001 (lower base score) is **approved** due to the bonus.

#### **3. Geographic & Organizational Bias**
- **Highland Civic Darts Club** members are **overrepresented** in the logs (C001, C004) and appear to receive **automatic boosts**.
- **Non-members** (C002, C003, C005) face **harsher scrutiny**, with C003 being **rejected despite a higher raw score**.

### **Implications for Fairness & Equity**

1. **Systemic Penalty for Non-Organization Members**
   - People **not in community groups** (e.g., isolated individuals, newcomers, or those in less recognized groups) face **structural disadvantages**.

2. **Arbitrary Scoring vs. Objective Creditworthiness**
   - A **715-score non-affiliated applicant (C003)** is **rejected**, while a **lower-scoring affiliated applicant (C001: 720 final)** is **approved**, even if C003 had better financial metrics.

3. **Exclusion of Low-Income or Rural Populations**
   - If community groups are **geographically concentrated** (e.g., urban darts clubs), rural or low-income individuals may be **systematically disadvantaged**.

### **Conclusion: Identifying Bias**

- **Explicit Bias?** Not directly discriminatory, but **indirect bias** via **mechanical score boosts** favoring **particular affiliations**.
- **Systemic Issue**: The **Community Adjustment rule** introduces **unfair advantages** based on **social connectivity rather than financial merit**.
- **Equity Impact**: Creates **two-tiered system** where **membership in certain groups (darts clubs, etc.)** overrides objective creditworthiness.

**Likely Root Cause**: The **+10 (Community)** adjustment is **not justified by neutral financial criteria**, leading to **adverse outcomes for the unaffiliated**.
