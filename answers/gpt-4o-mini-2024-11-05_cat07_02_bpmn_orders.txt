The visualization you provided appears to be a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram, representing the process flow of an order management system. This diagram outlines the interaction between various departments (Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse) in handling customer orders. Hereâ€™s an explanation of each section:

### 1. **Sales Process (Top Section)**
   - **Monday Morning**: The process begins at the start of the day.
   - **Check order for completeness**: The sales team verifies that the order includes all necessary details.
   - **Check if customer is in the database**: If the customer is not already in the database, they are added.
   - **Add customer to the database**: The new customer is entered into the system.
   - **Send order details**: Once the order is complete, details are sent to the next process.
   - **Draft invoice**: An invoice is prepared for the customer after the order is processed.

### 2. **Production Process (Middle Section)**
   - **Order details arrive**: The order details are sent from the Sales department.
   - **Plan production**: The production team plans how the product will be made based on the order.
   - **Manufacture product**: The product is produced.
   - **Material not faulty**: The process checks that the materials used are not faulty.
   - **Product complete**: Once production is completed, the product is ready for the next step.
   - **Send order details**: After production is complete, the product details are sent to the next process, likely to the Warehouse or to complete the order.

### 3. **Procurement (Subprocess for Material Management)**
   - **Order details arrive**: As in the Production process, the order details are received here as well.
   - **Order materials**: If materials are needed, they are ordered for production.
   - **Check materials**: The materials are checked for quality and quantity.
   - **Return material**: If materials are faulty or wrong, they are returned.
   - **Order cancellation**: If materials or the product order can't proceed, the order might be canceled.

### 4. **Warehouse Process (Bottom Section)**
   - **Product complete**: The completed product is received from the production process.
   - **Send product**: The Warehouse sends out the product to the customer after it is finished and ready for delivery.

### Key Elements:
   - **Tasks (Rectangles)**: These represent individual steps within each department, such as "Check order for completeness" or "Manufacture product."
   - **Gateways (Diamonds)**: Decision points, such as checking if a customer is in the database, deciding whether materials are faulty, or whether the order can be fulfilled.
   - **Subprocess (Double Circle)**: A set of tasks grouped together that represent a more detailed process. For example, the Material Compensation Subprocess includes tasks like ordering materials and checking them.
   - **Flows (Arrows)**: Represent the movement of information and tasks from one department to the next.

This BPMN diagram helps to visualize how different teams or departments collaborate to process customer orders from initiation to fulfillment, with checks and balances at each stage.
