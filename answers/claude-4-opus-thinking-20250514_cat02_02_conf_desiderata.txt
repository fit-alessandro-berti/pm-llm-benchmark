## Analysis of Event Log Compliance

### 1. Normative Rule Violations

**Case 2 - Multiple Critical Violations:**
- **Violation 1: Incorrect Activity Sequence**
  - Risk Assessment (08:20) was performed before Credit Check (09:00)
  - This violates the mandatory ordering rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment
  
- **Violation 2: Invalid Process Flow for Rejection**
  - Finalize Documentation was performed after the loan was rejected
  - The normative rules explicitly state that documentation should NOT be finalized after a rejection
  
- **Violation 3: Missing Required Activity**
  - The "Inform Applicant" activity is completely missing from the log
  - This is a mandatory step that must occur after the Loan Decision

**Cases 1 and 3:**
- Both cases follow the correct normative sequence with no violations
- Case 1: Perfect adherence to all mandatory rules for an approved loan
- Case 3: Correct sequence for an approved loan, though with timing delays (see desiderata section)

### 2. Desiderata (Best Practice) Deviations

**Case 1:**
- Credit Check timing:  Completed within 30 minutes (well within 24-hour recommendation)
- Inform Applicant timing:  Completed within 2 hours (well within 48-hour recommendation)
- Follow-up Call:  Not performed (but this is optional)

**Case 2:**
- Credit Check timing:  Completed within 20 minutes (meets desideratum)
- Inform Applicant timing: N/A (activity was completely missing - normative violation)
- Follow-up Call:  Not performed

**Case 3:**
- Credit Check timing:  Performed 49 hours after application (exceeds 24-hour recommendation)
- Inform Applicant timing:  Performed 51 hours after loan decision (exceeds 48-hour recommendation)
- Follow-up Call:  Not performed

### 3. Interpretations and Recommendations

**Case 1:** This represents ideal process execution with only the minor omission of the optional follow-up call.

**Case 2:** This case shows serious process failures that could indicate:
- Potential system errors or manual override of standard procedures
- Staff training issues regarding the mandatory sequence
- Possible confusion about rejection procedures
- **Recommendation:** Immediate process review and staff retraining required

**Case 3:** While normatively compliant, the delays suggest:
- Possible resource constraints or workload issues
- Weekend/holiday delays (application on Jan 12, processing resumed Jan 14)
- **Recommendation:** Review staffing levels and implement automated reminders for time-sensitive activities

### Summary
- **Critical Issues:** Only Case 2 has normative violations requiring immediate attention
- **Performance Optimization:** Cases 2 and 3 show opportunities for process improvement regarding timing
- **Minor Gap:** All cases omitted the recommended follow-up call, suggesting this practice may need reinforcement or reconsideration of its value
