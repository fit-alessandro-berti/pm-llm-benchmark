Here are the opposite, more general, and a new concept for each of the given Petri nets concepts:

1. **Source Place**:
	* Opposite: Sink Place (a place that consumes tokens, opposite of a source place that produces tokens)
	* More general: Any Place (places can have arbitrary properties, not just be sources or sinks)
	* New concept: Filter Place (a place that filters tokens based on certain conditions, e.g., tokens with specific labels or attributes)

2. **Immediate Transition**:
	* Opposite: Delayed Transition (a transition that occurs after a delay or timer expires)
	* More general: Transition (transitions are basic Petri net components, without specifying immediacy)
	* New concept: Conditional Transition (a transition that is triggered by specific conditions, e.g., presence of certain tokens)

3. **Live Transition**:
	* Opposite: Dead Transition (a transition that can never occur, e.g., due to insufficient tokens)
	* More general: Transition (transitions can be either live or dead, depending on the net's configuration)
	* New concept: Time-Triggered Transition (a transition that is triggered at specific times or intervals, e.g., every hour or day)

4. **Bounded Net**:
	* Opposite: Unbounded Net (a Petri net with unbounded capacities or cardinalities)
	* More general: Net (Petri nets can have various properties, bounded or unbounded)
	* New concept: Hierarchical Net (a Petri net composed of multiple, hierarchically organized subnets)

5. **Free Choice Net**:
	* Opposite: Deterministic Net (a net where transitions are uniquely determined by the current state)
	* More general: Net (Petri nets can be classified based on the number of choices, from deterministic to free-choice)
	* New concept: Probabilistic Net (a net where transitions have associated probabilities, allowing for non-deterministic behavior)

Please note that these new concepts are not necessarily officially recognized in the Petri net community, but they provide a way to think about and generalize the given concepts.
