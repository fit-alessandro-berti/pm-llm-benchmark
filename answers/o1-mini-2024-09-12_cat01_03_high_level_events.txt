**High-Level Process Mapping for Manufacturing Event Log**

Based on the provided sample event logs for cases A1 and B2, the low-level events have been analyzed and grouped into meaningful high-level process steps. Each high-level step represents a coherent stage in the manufacturing workflow, facilitating a clearer understanding of the overall process.

---

### 1. **Material Preparation**
   
   **Included Low-Level Activities:**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place metal sheet on table
   - Align metal sheet
   - Preheat metal sheet
   
   **Rationale:**
   These activities are focused on preparing the raw materials for production. They involve handling the raw metal sheet, ensuring it is correctly identified (via barcode scanning), positioning it appropriately, aligning it for processing, and preheating to the required temperature. This grouping encapsulates all tasks necessary to make the material ready for the subsequent manufacturing stages.

### 2. **Assembly (Welding)**
   
   **Included Low-Level Activities:**
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B
   
   **Rationale:**
   This set of activities pertains to the assembly phase, specifically the welding operations. It starts with the preparation of the welding tool, followed by the actual welding tasks at designated corners. Grouping these activities under "Assembly (Welding)" highlights the core manufacturing action of joining components together.

### 3. **Quality Inspection**
   
   **Included Low-Level Activities:**
   - Measure weld integrity
   
   **Rationale:**
   Quality Inspection is a critical phase ensuring that the welding meets the required standards. Measuring weld integrity using the quality sensor provides data on the strength and reliability of the welds. This activity is essential for maintaining product quality and safety.

### 4. **Protective Coating Application**
   
   **Included Low-Level Activities:**
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating
   
   **Rationale:**
   After assembly, applying a protective coating is necessary to prevent corrosion and enhance the product's durability. This step involves applying the coating material and subsequently drying it to ensure proper adhesion and finish. Grouping these activities emphasizes the finishing processes that protect and enhance the product.

---

### 5. **Final Inspection**
   
   **Included Low-Level Activities:**
   - Visual check
   
   **Rationale:**
   The final inspection serves as the last quality assurance step before the product is deemed complete. A visual check ensures that all previous steps have been executed correctly and that the product meets the visual and functional standards required. This activity marks the conclusion of the manufacturing process for each case.

**Summary:**

By aggregating the low-level events into these five high-level activities—**Material Preparation**, **Assembly (Welding)**, **Quality Inspection**, **Protective Coating Application**, and **Final Inspection**—the manufacturing process becomes more transparent and easier to analyze. This structured approach aids in identifying process efficiencies, potential bottlenecks, and areas for quality improvement.
