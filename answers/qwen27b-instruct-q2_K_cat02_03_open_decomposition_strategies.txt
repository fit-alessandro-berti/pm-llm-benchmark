Applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects can bring numerous benefits while presenting certain challenges:

Benefits:
1. **Simplification**: Decomposition simplifies complex processes into manageable segments making them easier to understand, analyze, optimize, and communicate their findings across departments.
2. **Resource Management**: By dividing resources appropriately among different parts of the process helps distribute workload efficiently ensuring all sections receive adequate attention which aids productivity improvement without necessarily increasing resources consumption drastically.
3. **Improved Planning**: It allows managers to plan effectively considering every step involved while having better control over costs incurred during each stage enhancing decision making capabilities significantly boosting project efficiency greatly reducing the risk of errors and misalignments leading towards higher success rates typically in long-term projects especially in critical areas.
4. **Risk Mitigation**: By breaking down processes smaller portions facilitate identification pinpointing and correction potential issues promptly preventing them from snowballing into bigger problems as they develop during execution thus saving time money resources for stakeholders involved.

Challenges:
1. **Complexity Management**: Determining an appropriate level of decomposition can be quite challenging balancing between too high complexity which makes understanding difficult versus too low complexity which may lead to oversimplification potentially omitting crucial process steps resulting in inaccurate insights.
   
2. **Communication Difficulty**: Ensuring all team members comprehend different sections and how they interrelate requires constant collaboration making communication among diverse groups, including management staff workers subcontractors partners clients etc., particularly challenging especially during early stages or when communication channels are unclear leading towards possible misunderstandings.

3. **Overlapping of responsibilities**: Defining precise boundaries between distinct processes components can prove to be quite difficult as certain tasks may overlap requiring coordination among team members risking delays in completion time which ultimately impacts project timeline negatively increasing chances for mistakes.

4. **Data Availability Issues**: Obtaining data necessary for decomposition from diverse sources can pose a significant challenge especially during initial stages when information is scarce unorganized making it hard for analysts to make informed decisions hindering progress towards final objectives negatively affecting overall project efficiency.

Implementing effective decomposition strategies requires balancing these benefits against challenges aiming towards efficient execution optimization improvement throughout entire project lifecycle ensuring success in face of ever-evolving complex tasks and requirements faced within organizations particularly large scale enterprises encompassing various departments stakeholders involved.
