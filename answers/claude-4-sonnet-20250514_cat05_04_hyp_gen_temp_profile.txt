## Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

### 1. Receive to Approve (R  P) Pattern
- **Average**: 25 hours with extremely low standard deviation (1 hour)
- **Anomaly**: The rigid timing suggests an artificial or automated approval schedule rather than natural business processing

### 2. Approve to Notify (P  N) Pattern  
- **Average**: 7 days with high variability (2-day standard deviation)
- **Anomaly**: Excessive delay between approval and customer notification, with inconsistent timing

### 3. Assign to Close (A  C) Pattern
- **Average**: 2 hours direct closure after assignment
- **Anomaly**: Claims being closed immediately after assignment without proper evaluation or approval steps

### 4. Evaluate to Notify (E  N) Pattern
- **Average**: 5 minutes between evaluation and notification
- **Anomaly**: Unrealistically fast transition suggesting automated processing or skipped verification steps

## Hypotheses for Anomaly Causes

### Systemic Issues
- **Batch Processing**: The rigid RP timing might indicate automated batch approval processes running on fixed schedules
- **Resource Bottlenecks**: The 7-day PN delay suggests notification systems or staff are overwhelmed
- **Process Shortcuts**: The 2-hour AC pattern indicates claims may be inappropriately fast-tracked or rejected without proper evaluation

### Operational Issues
- **System Integration Problems**: The 5-minute EN timing might reflect automated notifications triggering before human review completion
- **Workload Management**: Certain adjusters or regions may have different processing capabilities affecting timing consistency
- **Quality Control Gaps**: Fast closures and notifications may indicate insufficient review processes

## SQL Verification Queries

### Query 1: Identify Claims with Abnormal RP Timing
```sql
WITH rp_times AS (
    SELECT 
        r.claim_id,
        r.timestamp as receive_time,
        p.timestamp as approve_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) as duration_seconds
    FROM claim_events r
    JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
    WHERE r.activity = 'R' AND p.activity = 'P'
      AND p.timestamp > r.timestamp
)
SELECT claim_id, duration_seconds, duration_seconds/3600 as duration_hours
FROM rp_times 
WHERE duration_seconds < 82800 OR duration_seconds > 97200  -- Outside ±2 STDEV
ORDER BY duration_seconds;
```

### Query 2: Analyze PN Delays by Resource and Claim Type
```sql
WITH pn_delays AS (
    SELECT 
        c.claim_type,
        ce1.resource,
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp))/86400 as delay_days
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
      AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
)
SELECT 
    claim_type,
    resource,
    COUNT(*) as case_count,
    AVG(delay_days) as avg_delay_days,
    MAX(delay_days) as max_delay_days
FROM pn_delays
WHERE delay_days > 3  -- More than 3 days delay
GROUP BY claim_type, resource
ORDER BY avg_delay_days DESC;
```

### Query 3: Detect Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment
```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    ce1.resource as assigner,
    ce2.resource as closer,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp))/3600 as hours_to_close
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
  AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 10800  -- Less than 3 hours
ORDER BY hours_to_close;
```

### Query 4: Check for Missing Process Steps
```sql
WITH claim_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '' ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    activity_sequence,
    CASE 
        WHEN activity_sequence NOT LIKE '%E%' THEN 'Missing Evaluation'
        WHEN activity_sequence NOT LIKE '%P%' THEN 'Missing Approval'
        WHEN activity_sequence LIKE '%AC%' THEN 'Assign Direct to Close'
        ELSE 'Other Pattern'
    END as anomaly_type
FROM claim_activities
WHERE activity_sequence !~ '^R.*A.*E.*P.*N.*C$'  -- Doesn't follow expected sequence
ORDER BY anomaly_type;
```

### Query 5: Correlate Fast EN Transitions with Claim Characteristics
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    adj.specialization,
    adj.region,
    COUNT(*) as fast_notifications,
    AVG(c.claim_amount) as avg_claim_amount
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters adj ON ce1.resource = adj.name
WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 600  -- Less than 10 minutes
GROUP BY c.claim_type, c.claim_amount, adj.specialization, adj.region
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY fast_notifications DESC;
