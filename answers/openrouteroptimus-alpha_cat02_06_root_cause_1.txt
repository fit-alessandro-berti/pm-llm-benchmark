**1. Identifying Cases with Longer Resolution Times**

Let's calculate the total resolution time for each case—from the first "Receive Ticket" to the final "Close Ticket" event:

| Case | Start (Receive Ticket) | End (Close Ticket) | Resolution Time      |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| 101  | 2024-03-01 08:00      | 2024-03-01 10:15   | 2h 15m (2.25 hours)  |
| 102  | 2024-03-01 08:05      | 2024-03-02 09:15   | 25h 10m (~25.2 hrs)  |
| 103  | 2024-03-01 08:10      | 2024-03-01 09:30   | 1h 20m (1.33 hours)  |
| 104  | 2024-03-01 08:20      | 2024-03-02 08:30   | 24h 10m (~24.2 hrs)  |
| 105  | 2024-03-01 08:25      | 2024-03-03 09:30   | 49h 5m (~49.1 hours) |

**Significantly longer cases:** **102, 104, and 105**
- Normal: ~1–2.5 hours (101, 103)
- Long: ~24–49 hours (102, 104, 105)

**2. Root Cause Analysis of Performance Issues**

Let’s examine patterns and factors in the *delayed* cases:

### **Case 102**

**Activities:**
- Escalate to Level-2 Agent
- Large gaps:
  - Assign to Level-1 Agent  Escalate to Level-2 Agent = 2.5 hours
  - Escalate  Investigate (by Level-2) = 2.5 hours
  - Investigate  Resolve = 19 hours (overnight!)

**Observation:**
- Escalation present, leading to a handoff and a long delay before *resolution*, primarily due to waiting between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket".

---

### **Case 104**

**Activities:**
- No escalation
- Large gap:
  - Assign to Level-1 Agent  Investigate Issue = 3.5 hours
  - Investigate  Resolve = 19 hours (overnight!)

**Observation:**
- No formal escalation, but lengthy cycle between assignment, investigation, and especially from investigation to resolution (again, an overnight delay).

---

### **Case 105**

**Activities:**
- Escalation present **and** two "Investigate Issue" events (second after escalation)
- Large gaps:
  - Investigate (Level-1)  Escalate = 50 minutes
  - Escalate  Investigate (Level-2) = ~28 hours
  - Investigate (Level-2)  Resolve = 19 hours (overnight!)

**Observation:**
- Escalation process is drawn out: after escalation, it took over a **day** before investigation resumed, plus an additional overnight delay before ticket resolution.

---

### **Comparative Patterns**

**Escalation Presence:**  
- All cases with escalations (102, 105) have major delays, especially long waits between escalation and investigation or resolution.

**Delay Before Investigation/Resolution:**  
- All delayed cases have **long waits (several hours or overnight) between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket"**.

**Non-escalated fast cases (101, 103):**  
- Activities are performed rapidly, with only short intervals (usually 10–30 minutes) between each step.

**3. Explanation and Recommendations**

#### **Root Causes Identified:**
- **Escalation Increases Cycle Time:** Escalated tickets face significant delays, especially in the hand-off to the Level-2 Agent and the start of the investigation at this higher level.
- **Overnight or Extended Waiting Periods:** Critical transitions (like "Investigate" to "Resolve") are paused for many hours, often spanning an entire day—suggesting work is stopping at end of business hours and not resuming until the next day.
- **Delays Even Without Escalation:** Some cases face delays at the assignment or investigation stage, possibly due to agent workload, ticket complexity, or shift patterns (e.g., tickets assigned late in the day are resolved only when work resumes).

#### **How These Factors Lead to Increased Cycle Times:**
- **Escalations cause handoff friction:** Time is lost transferring context and waiting for availability of Level-2 staff.
- **Work scheduling / shift patterns:** Tickets not resolved by end of working hours are pushed out to the next day, dramatically increasing cycle time.
- **Resource constraints:** Backlogs or agent unavailability compound delays, especially for higher-level agents.

#### **Recommendations:**

1. **Improve Escalation Handling:**
   - **Reduce handoff times:** Implement real-time notifications and SLAs for Level-2 agent response on escalated tickets.
   - **Cross-train Level-1 agents:** For common escalations, empower Level-1 agents to handle more cases without escalation.
   - **Early detection:** Identify tickets likely needing escalation sooner to minimize unnecessary Level-1 delay.

2. **Optimize Scheduling and Staffing:**
   - **Stagger shifts or overlap coverage:** Ensure staff are available late in the day to avoid overnight ticket stagnation.
   - **Monitor ticket age:** Prioritize "aging" tickets to prevent them rolling over into the next day.

3. **Increase Process Monitoring:**
   - **Set internal targets** between key activities (especially for transitions prone to overnight/extended delays).
   - **Root cause review for delayed tickets:** Periodically analyze long-cycle tickets to see if delays are systemic or case-specific.

4. **Automation and Self-Service:**
   - Where possible, provide customers with more self-resolution options for common issues to reduce total ticket volume and allow agents to prioritize complex cases.

**Summary Table**

| Factor                           | Impact on Cycle Time                 | Cases Most Affected |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Escalation to Level-2             | Delays of 12+ to 36 hours            | 102, 105            |
| Overnight delay (pause in activity)| Adds ~19 hours per night of delay    | 102, 104, 105       |
| Long wait before investigation    | Delays initial progress on resolution | 104, 105            |
| No escalation, quick flow         | Fast resolution (few interruptions)   | 101, 103            |

**In summary:**
Escalations and stalls across business hours (especially between "Investigate" and "Resolve") are the primary factors in long tickets. To reduce ticket cycle times, streamline escalations, ensure staffing matches ticket arrival times, and closely monitor tickets at risk of lingering overnight or over weekends.
