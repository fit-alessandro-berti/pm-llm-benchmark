1. Normative (hard-rule) compliance check

Case 1 – COMPLIANT  
• Order of activities exactly matches the mandated sequence.  
• Approved branch correctly finalises documentation before closing.  
 No normative violations.

Case 2 – NON-COMPLIANT  
a. “Risk Assessment” recorded before “Credit Check”.  
   – Violates rule: Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.  
b. “Finalize Documentation” executed after a Rejected decision.  
   – Violates rule: documentation must NOT be finalised for rejections.  
c. “Inform Applicant” never occurs.  
   – Violates rule: applicant must be informed after every decision.  
d. Closing occurs after the impermissible documentation step.  
   – Compound effect of (b) and (c).  
 Several hard-rule breaches; the trace is normatively invalid.

Case 3 – COMPLIANT  
• All mandatory activities appear once and in the required order.  
• Approved branch finalises documentation before closing.  
 No violations of strict ordering or branching rules.



2. Desiderata (soft-goal) compliance check

Legend:  = timing recommendation not met,  = optional activity omitted

Case 1  
 Follow-up Call missing.  
(All timing recommendations are met.)  

Case 2  
 Follow-up Call missing.  
(Timing for Credit Check is fine, but “Inform Applicant” is absent; that is already a normative breach, so no timing evaluation is possible.)

Case 3  
 Credit Check performed ~49 h after application (>24 h recommended).  
 Inform Applicant performed ~51 h after decision (>48 h recommended).  
 Follow-up Call missing.



3. Possible interpretations / mitigations

Case 1  
• Smooth, ideal execution; the only shortfall is the missing follow-up call, which may simply be unlogged or judged unnecessary because the applicant was already contacted promptly.

Case 2  
• The early Risk Assessment could stem from a data-entry mistake or from running a preliminary risk scoring tool before the formal credit bureau query was logged.  
• “Finalize Documentation” after rejection might indicate the employee closed internal paperwork (e.g., archiving) but chose the wrong activity label.  
• Omitting “Inform Applicant” is serious; perhaps the rejection notice was sent but not captured in the system.

Case 3  
• The application arrived on a Friday and the credit check happened on Sunday; the 24-hour window was missed, possibly due to weekend staffing.  
• The 51-hour delay in informing the customer may be the result of waiting for the applicant to be reachable or for supplementary information.  
• As with the other cases, the follow-up call could have been performed informally or recorded in another channel.


Summary
• Normative violations occur only in Case 2.  
• Desiderata shortfalls: minor in Case 1 (no call), multiple in Case 3, and again no call in Case 2.  
Addressing the Case 2 breaches should be the immediate priority; the desiderata gaps represent performance-improvement opportunities rather than compliance failures.
