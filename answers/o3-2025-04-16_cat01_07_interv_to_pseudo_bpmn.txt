FLOW ELEMENTS (numbered for easy diagramming)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
0  Start Event: “Invoice Received (e-mail from Supplier)”[Supplier  AP-Clerk]

1  Task (AP-Clerk): “Verify that Invoice contains valid PO number”

2  EXCLUSIVE GATEWAY G1 “PO present?”  
    Yes  3  
    No   2a

2a Task (AP-Clerk): “Return invoice / request PO from Supplier”  
     Wait for corrected invoice  loop back to 0  
    NOTE: If Supplier unresponsive for N days, AP-Clerk MAY escalate to AP-Supervisor (see 2b)

2b Task (AP-Supervisor): “Escalate missing-PO case”  
     Supplier provides PO  back to 0  
     Decide to Reject Invoice  End Event “Invoice Rejected – no PO”

3  Task (AP-Clerk): “Log Invoice in Accounting System”

4  Task (AP-Clerk  Purchasing Officer): “Forward invoice & PO for goods-receipt confirmation”

5  Task (Purchasing Officer): “Compare invoice vs. PO (qty, price, delivery charges) & check goods receipt”

6  EXCLUSIVE GATEWAY G2 “Invoice matches PO & goods received?”  
    Yes  7  
    No   6a

6a Task (Purchasing Officer / AP-Clerk): “Hold invoice & resolve discrepancy”  
       – If minor: Purchasing contacts Supplier or asks AP to hold  
       – If PO missing: request PO info  
       – Create Data Object: Discrepancy Note  
   INTERMEDIATE EVENT: “Corrected invoice / info arrives”  back to 5  
   If discrepancy cannot be resolved  escalate to AP-Supervisor (6b)

6b Task (AP-Supervisor): “Coordinate complex discrepancy / informal service”  
       – May involve Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) or Department Head  
       – Option 1: Create Retrospective PO  back to 5  
       – Option 2: Decide to Reject Invoice  End Event “Invoice Rejected – unresolved discrepancy”

7  Task (Purchasing Officer): “Send confirmation e-mail to AP-Clerk”

8  Task (AP-Clerk): “System performs 3-way match; trigger manager approval request”

9  Task (Department Manager): “Review & Approve / Reject Invoice”

10 EXCLUSIVE GATEWAY G3 “Manager approval granted?”  
    Approved  11  
    Rejected  10a

10a Task (AP-Clerk): “Hold & investigate manager rejection”  
       – Possibly consult Purchasing or Supervisor  
       – When corrected  loop back to 8  
       – If ultimately unresolvable  End Event “Invoice Rejected – manager denial”

11 Task (AP-Clerk): “Schedule invoice in next payment run”

12 Task (Accounting System): “Generate Payment Schedule & execute payment”

13 End Event: “Invoice Paid”

====================================================================
NOTED EXCEPTIONS / VARIATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------
E1  Informal-service invoices with no prior PO  
    – Detected at G1 or during Purchasing review  
    – AP-Supervisor may arrange Retrospective PO or reject invoice.

E2  Delayed Supplier response on missing PO or pricing mismatch  
    – AP-Clerk may escalate to AP-Supervisor after timeout.

E3  Manager rejection loop  
    – Rare ( once every couple of months per Carlos)  
    – Triggers re-investigation; same resolution path as other discrepancies.

====================================================================
UNCERTAINTIES / MINOR INCONSISTENCIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------
• Dan “assumes” that after his confirmation the invoice goes to Manager; Mary confirms this is the actual flow.  
• Interviewees did not specify SLA times for holds, escalations, or payment-run frequency—left open.
