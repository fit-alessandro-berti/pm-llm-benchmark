Notes & Ambiguities
• Interviewees differ slightly on whether AP Clerk matches line items before or after Purchasing’s confirmation. Model shows confirmation first (dominant description), but step order could swap without impact.  
• Frequency of Manager rejection is “once every couple of months”; treated as an infrequent branch.  
• “Services with informal agreements” handled by AP Supervisor; may involve retrospective PO creation (shown in exception path).  
• Systemgenerated emails treated as tasks in Accounting System lane where relevant.  
• Payment execution itself (bank interface, etc.) is outside the scope given; model ends at “queued for payment”.
