# Process Mining Approach for Optimizing Speedy Parcels' Last-Mile Delivery Operations

As a **Process Mining Consultant** specializing in logistics and transportation, I will outline a comprehensive, data-driven approach to analyze Speedy Parcels’ delivery operations using the six-month event log. The goal is to **identify inefficiencies, root causes of delays and high costs**, and **propose actionable optimization strategies** to improve **delivery punctuality** and **reduce operational costs**.

---

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**

**Objective:** Create a unified, semantically enriched event log suitable for process mining analysis.

**Steps:**

- **Data Extraction and Structuring:**
  - Extract GPS logs (location, speed, status), scanner events (delivery milestones), dispatch data (routes, time windows), and maintenance logs (downtime, repairs).
  - Normalize timestamps across all data sources to a unified time zone and format.
  - Map vehicle IDs, driver IDs, and package IDs across systems to ensure traceability.

- **Data Enrichment:**
  - Add contextual attributes such as:
    - Time of day
    - Day of week
    - Route ID
    - Scheduled vs. actual delivery time
    - Distance between stops (from GPS coordinates)
    - Vehicle type and capacity
    - Traffic zone or area code
  - Impute missing data (e.g., interpolate GPS coordinates during signal loss).
  - Define case identifiers:
    - Primary case ID: `Vehicle-Day` (e.g., V12-20241205)
    - Secondary case ID: `Package ID` for per-package tracking.

**Challenges:**
- Temporal misalignment between systems (e.g., scanner events not aligned with GPS data).
- Missing or inconsistent event types (e.g., no "Depart Depot" event in GPS logs).
- Data sparsity (e.g., infrequent GPS pings leading to incomplete travel paths).
- Ambiguity in event semantics (e.g., “Unscheduled Stop” could mean traffic, breakdown, or driver break).

---

### **Process Discovery**

**Techniques:**
- Use **inductive miner**, **heuristic miner**, or **alpha miner** algorithms to extract the actual delivery process from the event log.
- Build multiple process models:
  - **Vehicle-level process**: From depot departure to return, capturing travel, stops, deliveries, delays.
  - **Package-level process**: From depot scan to delivery success/failure.
  - **Driver-level process**: Including shift start/end, driving, waiting, and customer interaction times.

**Visualization Elements:**
- **Start/End Events**: Shift start, depot departure, depot return, shift end.
- **Activities**:
  - Depart/Arrive Depot
  - Travel Between Stops
  - Arrive Customer
  - Delivery Success/Failed
  - Depart Customer
  - Low Speed / Traffic Delays
  - Unscheduled Stops (Maintenance, Breakdowns)
- **Gateways**:
  - Decision points (e.g., failed delivery  reattempt / reschedule)
  - Parallel activities (e.g., multiple packages delivered per stop)

**Insights:**
- Identify frequent **deviations** such as unplanned stops, re-deliveries, and detours.
- Reveal **non-standard delivery sequences** (e.g., skipping stops, backtracking).
- Highlight **process variability** across drivers, vehicles, and days.

---

### **Conformance Checking**

**Objective:** Compare the **actual process** with the **planned process** (from the dispatch system).

**Approach:**
- Map planned routes (from dispatch system) into a process model.
- Overlay actual execution logs to detect deviations.

**Deviation Types:**
1. **Sequence Deviations**:
   - Stops visited out of order or skipped entirely.
2. **Timing Deviations**:
   - Actual arrival/departure times significantly differ from planned.
3. **Structural Deviations**:
   - Extra stops not in the planned route (e.g., unscheduled maintenance, customer reattempts).
4. **Resource Deviations**:
   - Vehicle or driver assigned differently than planned.

**Techniques:**
- **Alignment-based conformance checking** to measure deviation costs.
- **Fitness and precision metrics** to assess how well the actual process aligns with the planned one.
- **Deviation maps** to highlight problematic routes or drivers.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

| KPI | Definition | Source |
|-----|------------|--------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | % of deliveries made within customer time window | Scanner + Dispatch |
| **Average Time per Delivery Stop** | Total time from arrive to depart per stop | Scanner |
| **Travel vs. Service Time Ratio** | Proportion of driving vs. customer interaction time | GPS + Scanner |
| **Fuel Consumption per km / per package** | Fuel usage normalized by distance or number of packages | Vehicle telemetry + Dispatch |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | % of time vehicle is in use vs. idle | GPS + Dispatch |
| **Frequency of Traffic Delays** | Number of low-speed events per route/day | GPS |
| **Duration of Traffic Delays** | Total time spent in low-speed zones | GPS |
| **Failed Delivery Rate** | % of attempted deliveries that failed | Scanner |
| **Reattempt Rate** | % of failed deliveries that were reattempted | Scanner + Dispatch |

---

### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques**

- **Bottleneck Miner**: Identify high waiting times between activities.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Determine if specific drivers or vehicles consistently cause delays.
- **Variant Analysis**: Compare process paths across different days, drivers, or routes to identify high-performing and underperforming variants.
- **Time-based Filtering**: Focus on specific hours (e.g., morning rush hour) or days (e.g., Mondays) with high deviation.
- **Heatmaps**: Overlay GPS data with traffic data to identify **hotspots** where delays frequently occur.

**Common Bottlenecks:**
- **Traffic congestion** at specific junctions or during peak hours.
- **Excessive dwell time** at customer stops (e.g., due to inefficient scanning or customer delays).
- **Inefficient route sequences** leading to backtracking or unnecessary travel.
- **Frequent unplanned stops** due to vehicle issues or driver breaks.
- **High failed delivery rates** in certain zones or time windows.

**Quantification:**
- For each bottleneck, calculate:
  - Average time lost per occurrence.
  - Total time lost per week/month.
  - Impact on KPIs (e.g., how many late deliveries per 10 minutes of traffic delay).

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### **Potential Root Causes and Validation via Process Mining**

1. **Suboptimal Route Planning**
   - **Symptom:** Frequent detours, backtracking, or stops out of sequence.
   - **Validation:** Use variant analysis to compare planned vs. actual routes; identify high deviation patterns.

2. **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations**
   - **Symptom:** Consistent late arrivals despite planned time windows.
   - **Validation:** Overlay actual arrival times with dispatch estimates; analyze underestimation trends.

3. **Traffic Congestion Patterns**
   - **Symptom:** Repeated low-speed events on certain roads or at certain times.
   - **Validation:** Correlate GPS low-speed events with time and location; build heatmaps of congestion zones.

4. **High Service Time Variability**
   - **Symptom:** Wide variation in time spent per stop, even for similar customers.
   - **Validation:** Analyze stop durations per package type, customer zone, or driver; identify outliers.

5. **Vehicle Breakdowns and Maintenance**
   - **Symptom:** Unscheduled stops leading to shift extensions or reassignments.
   - **Validation:** Link maintenance logs with GPS/Driver logs; identify vehicles with high downtime.

6. **Driver Behavior or Skill Differences**
   - **Symptom:** Some drivers consistently have higher delivery times or more failed attempts.
   - **Validation:** Compare driver performance across multiple metrics; identify high-performing and underperforming drivers.

7. **Failed Delivery Attempts**
   - **Symptom:** High failed delivery rates in certain zones or time windows.
   - **Validation:** Use process mining to trace failed deliveries and re-deliveries; assess their impact on fuel and labor costs.
