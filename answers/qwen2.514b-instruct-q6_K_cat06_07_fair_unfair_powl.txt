To create the POWL models for GlobalTeq Solutions' hiring process, we will use the provided activities and labels. The first model will highlight a potential unfairness by introducing a bias at the cultural fit evaluation stage based on community affiliation. The second model will ensure fairness by removing this biased branch.

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model, after passing the skill assessment, there is an XOR choice where applicants who are members of the "Global Business Leaders Club" or flagged as local residents receive a subtle advantage during their cultural fit evaluation. This creates a potential unfairness in the hiring process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition

# Define Activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = SilentTransition()  # Loop for incomplete data
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck") 
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for Data Completeness Check
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# XOR Choice: Standard Cultural Fit vs. Community Affiliation Check
XorChoice = OperatorPOWL(operator=pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.XOR, 
                         children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Partial Order to define sequence and concurrency
HiringProcessUnfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, DataLoop, SkillAssessment, XorChoice, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
HiringProcessUnfair.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessCheck, SkillAssessment)  # Ensure data completeness before skill assessment
HiringProcessUnfair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, XorChoice)               # Post-skill assessment, proceed to cultural fit check
HiringProcessUnfair.order.add_edge(XorChoice, ManagerialReview)              # Cultural fit results influence managerial review
HiringProcessUnfair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)          # Hiring decision after managerial review

print(HiringProcessUnfair)
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model eliminates the potential unfairness by ensuring all applicants undergo a standard cultural fit evaluation without any community affiliation advantages. This way, the process is transparent and fair.

```python
# POWL Model for Fair Hiring Process
HiringProcessFair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, DataLoop, SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
HiringProcessFair.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessCheck, SkillAssessment)    # Ensure data completeness before skill assessment
HiringProcessFair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck)  # Post-skill assessment, proceed to cultural fit check
HiringProcessFair.order.add_edge(StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)# Cultural fit results influence managerial review
HiringProcessFair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)           # Hiring decision after managerial review

print(HiringProcessFair)
```

In both models:
- The `ReceiveApplication` activity collects initial resumes and applications.
- The `DataCompletenessCheck` ensures all necessary information is present; if not, the applicant is prompted to provide additional details (`RequestMoreInfo`) until their data is complete.
- The `SkillAssessment` evaluates applicants based on specific skills relevant to the job position.
- After passing the skill test, applicants face either a standard cultural fit evaluation or an affiliated check in the first model.
- Both models ensure that managerial review and final decision-making are based on consistent criteria without favoritism towards any group.

The primary difference lies in how cultural fit is evaluated post-skill assessment: the unfair model introduces a bias for community-affiliated candidates, while the fair model ensures all applicants face an unbiased evaluation.
