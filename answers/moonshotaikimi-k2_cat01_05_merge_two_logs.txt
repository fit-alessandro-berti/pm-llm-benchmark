Merged Event Log  
(Format: merged_timestamp, unified_event_type, order_id, system_sources, user_id, resource_id, notes)

1. 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, Order Received / OrderReceived, Order#1234, [A,B], u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"  
2. 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, Order Validated / OrderValidation, Order#1234, [A,B], u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"  
3. 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z-05Z, Payment Processed / PaymentCheck, Order#1234, [A,B], u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"  
4. 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, –B–, u45, r11, "Random inspection"   *(exists only in System B)*  
5. 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z-02Z, Item Shipped / Shipping, Order#1234, [A,B], u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"  
6. 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234, –A–, –, –, *(exists only in System A)*  

Reasoning (step-by-step)
• Time tolerance used: ±2 s. Any difference 2 s is treated as a match unless context indicates otherwise.  
• Overlap resolution: To preserve System A’s “primary timeline” semantics, Log A’s timestamp is kept as the canonical merged_timestamp. Log B’s slightly-off times are dropped once alignment is accepted.  
• Event-type consolidation:  
  – “OrderReceived” vs “Order Received”  same action.  
  – “Order Validation”  “Order Validated”.  
  – “PaymentCheck”  “Payment Processed”.  
  – “Shipping”  “Item Shipped”.  
• Non-overlapping events:  
  – “Quality Check” (Log B) has no analogue in Log A and is retained with “–B–” flag.  
  – “Item Delivered” (Log A) has no analogue in Log B and is retained with “–A–” flag.
