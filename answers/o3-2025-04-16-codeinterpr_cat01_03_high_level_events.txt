Proposed Higher-Level View of the Manufacturing Process
=======================================================

1. Material Preparation  
2. Joining / Assembly  
3. In-Process Quality Verification  
4. Surface Finishing  
5. Final Quality Inspection  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
A. How the Low-Level Events were Grouped
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Material Preparation  
   • Activities:  
     – Retrieve raw metal sheet  
     – Scan barcode  
     – Place metal sheet on table  
     – Align metal sheet  
     – Preheat metal sheet  
   • Rationale:  
     Every action is performed before any permanent transformation (welding, coating, etc.) occurs and is aimed at getting the raw material into the correct position, orientation, and temperature.  
   • Typical resource pattern: Human operator  robot arm  pre-heater.  
   • Temporal pattern: All five events happen in rapid succession (< 30–40 s apart).

2. Joining / Assembly  
   • Activities:  
     – Pick up welding tool  
     – Weld corner A  
     – Weld corner B  
   • Rationale:  
     These events are dedicated to attaching/assembling two parts of the workpiece. They are executed by the same operator (or at least the same work station) without an intervening step from another phase.  
   • Resource pattern: Single operator with a welding tool.  
   • Temporal pattern: Starts with “Pick up welding tool” and ends when the last weld is finished ( 10 s separation).

3. In-Process Quality Verification  
   • Activity:  
     – Measure weld integrity  
   • Rationale:  
     A sensorbased measurement that immediately follows the welding operation, providing direct feedback on the quality of the newly created joints.  
   • Resource: Quality Sensor.  
   • Temporal placement: Always the first sensor activity after welding.

4. Surface Finishing  
   • Activities:  
     – Apply protective coating  
     – Dry coating  
   • Rationale:  
     Both events are concerned with adding and curing a surface layer. They always appear consecutively and use the coating unit followed by a heating unit.  
   • Resource pattern: Coating Unit  Heating Unit.  
   • Temporal pattern:  20 s gap between coating and start of drying.

5. Final Quality Inspection  
   • Activity:  
     – Visual check  
   • Rationale:  
     Human confirmation that the product meets visual standards after all prior processing steps are complete.  
   • Resource: Operator C (or any human inspector).  
   • Temporal placement: Last event before the case closes or the product moves to logistics.

B. Heuristics / Rules That Generalise to the Full Log
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1 – Keyword mapping  
• “Retrieve”, “Scan barcode”, “Place … on table”, “Align”, “Preheat”  Material Preparation.  
• “Pick up … tool”, “Weld …”  Joining / Assembly.  
• “Measure … integrity”, any non-destructive test right after joining  In-Process Quality Verification.  
• “Apply … coating”, “Dry coating”, “Cure …”  Surface Finishing.  
• “… check”, “Visual inspection”, “Final audit”  Final Quality Inspection.

Rule 2 – Temporal proximity  
• If two activities that belong to the same phase occur within a configurable gap (e.g.,  60 s) and no keyword indicates a phase change, they are assigned to the same high-level step.

Rule 3 – Resource type  
• Sensor activities not preceded by “Apply” or “Dry” keywords are qualityrelated.  
• Coating/Heating units primarily indicate Surface Finishing.  
• Robot/Operator events containing “Align”, “Place”, “Retrieve” suggest Material Preparation.

Rule 4 – Sequence constraints  
• A case must respect the order: Preparation  Assembly  In-process QA  Finishing  Final QA.  
  If an activity violates this sequence, start a new occurrence of the phase or flag for manual review.

C. Structured Representation (example JSON schema)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For each CaseID:

```
{
  "CaseID": "A1",
  "HighLevelSteps": [
    {
      "StepNo": 1,
      "Name": "Material Preparation",
      "StartTime": "2024-03-01 08:00:05",
      "EndTime":   "2024-03-01 08:00:20",
      "ContainedActivities": [
        "Retrieve raw metal sheet",
        "Scan barcode",
        "Place metal sheet on table",
        "Align metal sheet",
        "Preheat metal sheet"
      ]
    },
    {
      "StepNo": 2,
      "Name": "Joining / Assembly",
      "StartTime": "2024-03-01 08:01:00",
      "EndTime":   "2024-03-01 08:01:10",
      "ContainedActivities": [
        "Pick up welding tool",
        "Weld corner A",
        "Weld corner B"
      ]
    },
    {
      "StepNo": 3,
      "Name": "In-Process Quality Verification",
      "StartTime": "2024-03-01 08:01:20",
      "EndTime":   "2024-03-01 08:01:20",
      "ContainedActivities": [
        "Measure weld integrity"
      ]
    },
    {
      "StepNo": 4,
      "Name": "Surface Finishing",
      "StartTime": "2024-03-01 08:01:30",
      "EndTime":   "2024-03-01 08:01:45",
      "ContainedActivities": [
        "Apply protective coating",
        "Dry coating"
      ]
    },
    {
      "StepNo": 5,
      "Name": "Final Quality Inspection",
      "StartTime": "2024-03-01 08:02:00",
      "EndTime":   "2024-03-01 08:02:00",
      "ContainedActivities": [
        "Visual check"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The same mapping applies to Case B2 (and to the remainder of the full log).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
D. Benefits of the Aggregation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

• Compresses 12–15 micro-events per product into only 5 macro-events, simplifying dashboards and process mining models.  
• Facilitates cycle-time analysis per phase (e.g., Preparation averages 20 s, Finishing 40 s).  
• Makes bottleneck detection easier (e.g., if “Surface Finishing” has the longest waiting time).  
• Enables clearer exception handling: any skipped phase or backward jump becomes visible instantly at the higher level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
E. Next Steps (if you implement this)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Encode the keyword, resource, and temporal rules into an ETL script (e.g., Python/Pandas or SQL).  
2. Collapse rows per CaseID and StepNo, storing start/end, duration, and any rolled-up attributes you need (e.g., average temperature, min/max sensor score).  
3. Validate with domain experts—tweak rules or step names where necessary.  
4. Feed the aggregated log into your BI tool or process-mining engine.

With these rules and names, you can consistently convert the detailed machine log into a concise, business-meaningful view of the manufacturing process.
