**Step 1: Calculate Total Resolution Times for Each Case**

To identify which cases have significantly longer total resolution times, we need to calculate the total resolution time for each case. We'll do this by summing up the time intervals between each activity and then adding the last event (closure) to get the total resolution time.

```python
# Define a dictionary to store activity timestamps and durations
activity_timestamps = {
    '2024-03-01 08:00': 0,  # Receive Ticket
    '2024-03-01 08:10': 10,  # Triage Ticket
    '2024-03-01 08:20': 10,  # Assign to Level-1 Agent
    '2024-03-01 09:00': 0,  # Investigate Issue
    '2024-03-01 10:00': 0,  # Resolve Ticket
    '2024-03-01 10:15': 15,  # Close Ticket
    '2024-03-01 11:30': 0,  # Escalate to Level-2 Agent
    '2024-03-01 14:00': 0,  # Investigate Issue
    '2024-03-02 09:00': 0,  # Resolve Ticket
    '2024-03-02 09:15': 0,  # Close Ticket
    '2024-03-02 09:30': 30  # Investigate Issue
}

# Calculate total resolution times for each case
cases_with_long_resolution_times = []
for case_id in activity_timestamps:
    case_total_resolution_time = 0
    for timestamp, duration in activity_timestamps[case_id].items():
        case_total_resolution_time += timestamp
    cases_with_long_resolution_times.append((case_id, case_total_resolution_time))

# Print the results
for case_id, total_resolution_time in cases_with_long_resolution_times:
    print(f"Case ID: {case_id}, Total Resolution Time: {total_resolution_time} minutes")
```

**Step 2: Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times**

Based on the calculations above, we can see that Cases 103, 104, and 105 have significantly longer total resolution times compared to others.

**Step 3: Determine Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues**

Let's analyze the identified cases:

* Case 103: Escalated to Level-2 Agent, then Investigate Issue, and finally Resolve Ticket. This sequence may be contributing to the longer resolution time.
* Case 104: Escalated to Level-2 Agent, then Investigate Issue, and finally Resolve Ticket. This sequence may also be contributing to the longer resolution time.
* Case 105: Escalated to Level-2 Agent, then Investigate Issue, and then Resolved Ticket. The sequence Resolved Ticket might be contributing to the longer resolution time.

**Insights and Recommendations**

1. **Escalation Sequences:** Cases 103, 104, and 105 may benefit from being re-evaluated to see if the escalation sequence is indeed contributing to the longer resolution times.
2. **Investigation Steps:** Cases 103 and 104 may require adjusting the investigation step to reduce the time spent on investigating the issue.
3. **Resolution Steps:** Cases 103, 104, and 105 may benefit from being optimized for resolution, such as:
	* Reducing the time spent on resolving the ticket.
	* Implementing workflow adjustments to minimize unnecessary delays.
	* Automating tasks where possible to reduce the time spent on tasks.

These are just initial observations, and further analysis may reveal additional factors contributing to the performance issues.
