Here's a well-crafted **DuckDB SQL query** that fulfills the described task:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

###  Explanation:

- **Subquery**:
  - `SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`:
    - Groups the events by `case_id`.
    - Counts the number of events per case.
    - Filters to include only those cases that have **six or fewer** events.

- **Main Query**:
  - Selects **all columns** from the original `event_log` table.
  - Filters rows to include only those where the `case_id` is in the list of "valid" case IDs returned by the subquery.

This ensures that the final result includes **all events from cases with six or fewer events**, and excludes any event belonging to a case with more than six events.
