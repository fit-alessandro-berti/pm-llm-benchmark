Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to check each case in the event log against the normative process description and see if they deviate. Then, explain why they're violations. Let's start by understanding the normative process thoroughly.

First, the process starts with "Receive order." Then, "Check inventory" must happen next. After that, there's a decision based on inventory. If sufficient, the flow is Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close. If not, it's Cancel order -> Close.

So the key rules are:
1. Check inventory must come after Receive order and before any payment or cancellation.
2. If inventory is sufficient, the sequence is Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Package -> Ship -> Close.
3. If not sufficient: Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close.
4. Authorize payment should only happen after Check inventory and before Package.
5. Package items must be after Authorize and before Ship.
6. Ship order must come after Package and can't happen if Cancel was done.
7. Close order is the last in all cases.

Now, let's check each case one by one.

**Case 1:**
Sequence: Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Package -> Ship -> Close. This matches the normal flow perfectly. No issues here.

**Case 2:**
Sequence: Receive -> Check -> Package -> Authorize -> Ship -> Close. Oh, here Package comes before Authorize payment. But according to the rules, Authorize must come before Package. So this is a violation. The correct order should be Authorize first, then Package. So Case 2 is deviating.

**Case 3:**
Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Cancel -> Ship -> Close. Wait, after Authorize, they canceled the order. But after Cancel, they should not Ship. The normative says after Cancel, only Close. So Shipping after Cancel is a violation. Also, once Cancel is done, Package and Ship shouldn't happen. So Case 3 has a violation here because Ship is after Cancel.

**Case 4:**
Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close. This matches the cancellation scenario exactly. No issues.

**Case 5:**
Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Ship -> Close. Oh, here after Authorize, they skipped Package and went straight to Ship. But according to the process, Package must come before Ship. So Ship can't happen without Packaging first. So Case 5 is missing Package, making it a violation.

So summarizing the violations:
- Case 2: Package before Authorize.
- Case 3: Ship after Cancel.
- Case 5: Ship without Package.

Now, let's make sure there's no other issues. Let me double-check each case again.

Case 2 sequence: Check, then Package, then Authorize. Definitely Authorize comes after Package, which is wrong. Correct order is Authorize before Package. Yes.

Case 3: After Cancel, they Ship. The normative says after Cancel, no fulfillment steps. Ship is a fulfillment step, so that's wrong.

Case 5: Authorize -> Ship skips Package. So the Package step is missing. Therefore, Ship is not allowed here.

Yes, that's all. So the answer should point out Cases 2, 3, and 5 as violating, with the respective reasons.

**2. Explanation of Violations:**

**Case 2**  
- **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".  
- **Explanation:** The normative process specifies that authorization of payment must precede packaging. The sequence "Check inventory"  "Package items"  "Authorize payment" directly violates the rule that payment authorization is required before preparing items for shipment. This misordering indicates improper handling of payment validation before physical handling of goods.

**Case 3**  
- **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".  
- **Explanation:** Following a cancellation (due to insufficient inventory), no fulfillment activities like shipping should take place. The presence of "Ship order" after cancellation contradicts the explicit guidance that cancellation should lead directly to "Close order" without intervening fulfillment steps. This suggests an invalid attempt to ship a canceled order.

**Case 5**  
- **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs without "Package items".  
- **Explanation:** The normative process requires packaging to precede shipping. The direct transition from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order" skips the mandatory "Package items" step. Shipping unprepared items violates the logical flow where packaging ensures readiness for shipment, posing risks of incomplete or incorrect deliveries.

**Summary of Key Rules Referenced:**  
- Authorization must precede packaging (Case 2).  
- Shipping is prohibited after cancellation (Case 3).  
- Packaging is a prerequisite for shipping (Case 5).
