### Transformed Process Mining Event Log

Below is the transformed event log in tabular format (CSV-like for readability). Each row represents an event suitable for import into standard process mining tools like ProM, Celonis, or Disco. I've aggregated low-level raw events (e.g., multiple TYPING instances, SCROLL, CLICK) into higher-level, meaningful activities based on context. Timestamps are the start time of the activity, with duration inferred for completeness (though not required, it's useful for analysis). Only essential events are included; switches and minor interactions (e.g., SCROLL) are not standalone events but inform case grouping and activity derivation.

### Explanation of Transformation Logic

**Case Identification:** I grouped events into cases based on logical units of user work tied to specific documents or tasks, using temporal proximity, application context, and cross-references as cues. This creates coherent "stories" of sessions rather than treating the entire log as one flat case. Specifically:
- **Case 1 (Quarterly Report Editing)**: Groups the initial focus on `Quarterly_Report.docx` at the start and the later typing/saving/closing at the end. These are connected thematically as iterative work on the same report document, bookended by switches to other tasks.
- **Case 2 (Document Drafting with Budget Integration)**: Encompasses all events related to `Document1.docx`, including drafting, saving, a temporary switch away (to email and PDF), and return for budget reference insertion. The return to the same document after budget work indicates it's part of the same drafting process.
- **Case 3 (Email Handling)**: Isolated as a self-contained email interaction (opening, replying, sending) about the "Annual Meeting," which is a distinct communication task without ties to other documents.
- **Case 4 (PDF Review)**: A brief, standalone review of `Report_Draft.pdf` (scrolling and highlighting), treated as its own case since it doesn't connect to ongoing document edits.
- **Case 5 (Budget Updating)**: Groups Excel-specific events (focus, typing updates, saving) as a financial task that feeds into Case 2 (via the later reference insertion), but kept separate to avoid merging unrelated apps/documents prematurely.

Switches (e.g., from Word to Chrome) were used to delineate case boundaries but not as events themselves, ensuring cases represent focused workflows rather than app-hopping noise. This results in 5 cases, which is analyst-friendly for discovering patterns like task interleaving (e.g., drafting interrupted by email).

**Activity Naming:** Raw low-level actions were abstracted into standardized, process-oriented names to enable discovery and conformance checking in tools. For example:
- Multiple TYPING events were consolidated into descriptive activities like "Draft Content" or "Insert Budget Reference" based on the `Keys` attribute.
- SAVE and CLOSE became explicit "Save [Document]" or "Close [Document]" activities.
- CLICK/OPEN actions became "Open [Specific Item]" or "Reply to Email."
- SCROLL and HIGHLIGHT were rolled into a single "Review [Document]" activity, as they represent exploratory reading without content creation.
- FOCUS and SWITCH were not retained as activities but used for context (e.g., starting a new case).

This standardization reduces granularity (e.g., no separate events for each keystroke) while preserving meaning, making the log suitable for analyzing sequences like "Draft  Save  Integrate Reference  Close." Additional attributes like `Application` and `Resource` (derived from Window) provide context for filtering or role-based analysis. Durations were estimated from timestamp deltas for completeness but can be ignored if not needed. Overall, this log reveals a narrative of report preparation involving drafting, communication, review, and data integration.
