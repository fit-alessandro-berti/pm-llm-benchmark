###  **1. Identifying Issues with the Current Model**

The **main problem** with the current process tree is that it **underfits** the real behavior by using a **parallel (`AND`) operator** to group key activities that must happen in a **specific order**. Specifically:

These steps:

```plaintext
Create Purchase Order
Receive Goods
Receive Invoice
Match Invoice to PO
Pay Invoice
```

Are placed in a **parallel block**, meaning they can occur **in any order**, which is **incorrect** in the "Procure-to-Pay" domain.

---

#### Domain Logic Requirements for Sequential Execution:
The correct logic (that should be enforced) is:

1. `Create_Purchase_Requisition`
2. `Approve_Purchase_Requisition`
3. `Create_Purchase_Order` — only **after** approval.
4. `Receive_Goods` **and** `Receive_Invoice` — can occur in **any order**, since they are typically done by logistics and finance separately.
5. `Match_Invoice_to_PO` — occurs **after** both invoice and goods are available.
6. `Pay_Invoice` — occurs **after matching** is done.
7. `Close_Case`

---

###  Problem With Current Model:
```python
parallel_block = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[
    create_po,
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice
])
```

This allows `pay_invoice` or `match_invoice` to occur **before** even receiving the invoice or goods, which is logically invalid.

---

###  **2. Corrected Process Tree Implementation**

Below is the **corrected** version of the process tree in Python pseudocode. It enforces proper sequencing and conditional parallelism.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Define activities as leaves
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Step 4 & 5 can occur in any order: Receive Goods AND Receive Invoice
receive_goods_and_invoice = ProcessTree(
    operator=Operator.PARALLEL,  # They can happen in parallel/asynchronously
    children=[receive_goods, receive_invoice]
)

# Full corrected tree
root = ProcessTree(
    operator=Operator.SEQUENCE,
    children=[
        create_req,
        approve_req,
        create_po,
        receive_goods_and_invoice,
        match_invoice,
        pay_invoice,
        close_case
    ]
)
```

---

###  **3. Explanation of Corrected Process Tree Structure**

####  Sequence Enforced:

| Step | Activity | Justification of Position        |
|------|----------|----------------------------------|
| 1. | `Create_Purchase_Requisition`   | Always the starting point |
| 2. | `Approve_Purchase_Requisition`  | Must be approved before continuing |
| 3. | `Create_Purchase_Order`         | Only created after PR is approved |
| 4-5.| `Receive_Goods` & `Receive_Invoice` | Can happen in **any order** — hence **parallel** |
| 6. | `Match_Invoice_to_PO`           | Requires both goods and invoice |
| 7. | `Pay_Invoice`                   | Payment happens **after** matching |
| 8. | `Close_Case`                    | Final action |

####  Restrictions Now Enforced:

- No payment can happen before invoice and goods are received.
- "Matching invoice to PO" only allowed after both goods and invoice are in.
- Invoice and goods can arrive in varying order — this is the only point with justified parallelism.
- No activity can happen before its logical predecessor.

---

###  **Summary**

- **Issue Fixed**: The irresponsible use of the `PARALLEL` operator that allowed critical activities to occur out of order.
- **New Model** enforces strict sequencing while keeping justified concurrency only between receiving goods and invoice.
- **Result**: The process tree now properly **fits the domain logic** and ensures **valid execution traces only**.
