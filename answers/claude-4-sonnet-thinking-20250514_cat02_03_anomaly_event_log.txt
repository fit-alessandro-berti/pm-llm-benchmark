Looking at this P2P event log, I can identify several significant anomalies that deviate from standard business practices. Let me analyze each case:

## **Case 1001 - NORMAL**
This case follows the expected P2P sequence correctly:
- Requisition created  Approved  PO issued  Goods received  Invoice received  Invoice matched  Payment released  Case closed

## **Case 1002 - MULTIPLE SEVERE ANOMALIES**

1. **Missing Initial Approval**: Purchase Order was issued (08:40) immediately after requisition creation (08:30) without proper approval
2. **Premature Payment**: Payment was released (07:15 on Feb 3) before:
   - Goods were received
   - Invoice matching was completed
   - Proper approvals were in place
3. **Retroactive Approval**: Purchase requisition was approved (08:00 on Feb 3) AFTER the PO was issued and payment was made
4. **Post-Payment Activities**: Goods receipt and invoice matching occurred after payment, defeating the purpose of controls

## **Case 1003 - CRITICAL PAYMENT ANOMALY**

1. **Premature Payment**: Payment was released on Feb 8 before:
   - Vendor invoice was received (Feb 9)
   - Goods were received (Feb 10)
   - Invoice matching was performed (Feb 11)
2. **Complete Control Bypass**: This represents a total circumvention of the 3-way matching control (PO, receipt, invoice)

## **Case 1004 - GOODS RECEIPT BEFORE PURCHASE ORDER**

1. **Goods Received Before PO**: Goods were received (09:00) before the Purchase Order was issued (09:15)
2. **No Purchase Authorization**: Vendor delivered goods without a valid purchase commitment

## **Why These Anomalies Are Problematic:**

### **Financial Controls & Compliance**
- **3-Way Matching Violation**: Cases 1002 and 1003 completely bypass this fundamental control
- **Segregation of Duties**: Activities are occurring in wrong sequence, potentially by wrong personnel
- **Audit Trail Issues**: Retroactive approvals suggest potential fraud or system manipulation

### **Business Risks**
- **Duplicate Payments**: Without proper matching, payments could be made multiple times
- **Unauthorized Spending**: Payments without proper approvals violate spending authority
- **Vendor Fraud**: Payments before goods receipt enable potential vendor fraud
- **Inventory Discrepancies**: Receiving goods without POs creates inventory tracking issues

### **Operational Issues**
- **Cash Flow**: Premature payments negatively impact working capital
- **Contract Compliance**: Receiving goods before PO issuance may violate contract terms
- **Quality Control**: Bypass of normal receipt processes may compromise quality checks

**Most Critical**: Cases 1002 and 1003 show payments being made before basic verification steps, representing severe control failures that could enable fraud and financial losses.
