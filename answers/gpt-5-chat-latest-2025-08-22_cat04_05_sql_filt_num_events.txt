Got it. Here's a suitable DuckDB SQL query to achieve your requirement:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_event_counts c
    ON e.case_id = c.case_id
WHERE c.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation:
1. **`case_event_counts` CTE**  
   - Groups events by `case_id`.
   - Counts the number of events per case.

2. **Join back to the original table**  
   - Ensures we return *all events* for cases that satisfy the condition.

3. **Filter in WHERE**  
   - Excludes all records from cases where the event count is greater than 6.  

This way, you get the **full event data** for only the process instances of interest (6 events).  

Would you also like me to optimize this further into a **single-query form without a CTE**, for compactness?
