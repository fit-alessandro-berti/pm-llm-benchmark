Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group (first) and the 'unprotected' group (second):

1. **Registration Point**:
   - Protected Group: Patients often register at Emergency Room (ER) first (284 cases), while some also start with a specialist clinic like First Diagnosis (FD) (269 cases).
   - Unprotected Group: Most patients register directly at FD (1466 cases) or ER (1418 cases). There's no option to start with a different registration point as seen in the protected group.

2. **Expert Examination**:
   - Protected Group: Expert Examination is more prevalent, especially when combined with Thorough Examination (78 and 73 cases respectively).
   - Unprotected Group: Expert Examination is also common but often not combined with Thorough Examination (653 cases). When combined, it's less frequent than in the protected group (190 cases).

3. **Thorough Examination**:
   - Protected Group: Thorough Examination is more frequently used when combined with Expert Examination (78 and 73 cases).
   - Unprotected Group: Thorough Examination is often used independently (192 cases) or combined with regular Examination (604 cases). It's less frequent when combined with Expert Examination compared to the protected group.

4. **Treatment Unsuccessful**:
   - Protected Group: There are no process variants involving treatment unsuccessful.
   - Unprotected Group: Treatment unsuccessful is quite common, appearing in multiple process variants (e.g., 225, 190, 102 cases). This suggests that the unprotected group might face more complex or challenging health issues.

5. **Diagnosis and Treatment Steps**:
   - Protected Group: The process often goes directly from Diagnosis to Treatment without any unsuccessful treatment steps.
   - Unprotected Group: The process often involves multiple Diagnosis and Treatment steps, sometimes with unsuccessful treatments (e.g., 225, 190 cases).

6. **Discharge**:
   - Protected Group: Discharge is the final step in most processes.
   - Unprotected Group: There's a separate 'Discharge' variant (505 cases), suggesting that some patients might be discharged without going through all the usual steps.

7. **Performance Metric**:
   - Protected Group: Performance metric varies widely, with some processes having no performance data (e.g., Register at ER, Register at FD).
   - Unprotected Group: Most process variants have performance data, and it's consistently around 320000 for successful treatments, suggesting a more standardized process.

These differences suggest that the protected group might receive more specialized care, starting with different registration points, involving expert examinations and thorough examinations more often, and having smoother treatment processes. The unprotected group, on the other hand, seems to face more complex health issues, requiring multiple diagnosis and treatment steps, and sometimes resulting in unsuccessful treatments.
