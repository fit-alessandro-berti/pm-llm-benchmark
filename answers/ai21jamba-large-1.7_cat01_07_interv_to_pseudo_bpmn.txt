### BPMN-like Process Model for the Invoice Approval Process

Below is a structured textual description of the process based on the interview excerpts. The model includes activities, sequence flow, decision points, roles, inputs/outputs, and exceptions.

#### **Process: Invoice Approval**

**Participants/Roles:**

- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Responsible for initial processing, logging, and forwarding invoices.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Confirms receipt of goods/services and ensures invoice details match the purchase order (PO).
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita):** Resolves exceptions and escalations.
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Approves invoices after confirmation and matching.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Assists in resolving supplier-related issues.

**Activities/Tasks:**

1. Receive and Validate Invoice (Mary)
	- Check if the invoice is associated with a valid PO.
	- Log the invoice into the accounting system.
2. Request Supplier Clarification (Mary or Supplier Relationship Manager)
	- Send the invoice back to the supplier for additional details (if no PO or discrepancies exist).
3. Confirm Goods/Services Receipt (Purchasing Officer)
	- Verify that the goods/services listed on the invoice were received.
4. Match Invoice to PO (Accounts Payable Clerk)
	- Ensure the line items, pricing, and quantities match the PO.
5. Resolve Discrepancies (Accounts Payable Clerk or Supervisor)
	- Email the Purchasing team for clarification or escalate to the Supervisor if issues persist.
6. Approve Invoice (Department Manager)
	- Review invoice details and approve via the system.
7. Schedule Payment (Accounts Payable Clerk)
	- Add the approved invoice to the next payment cycle.
8. Handle Exceptions (Accounts Payable Supervisor)
	- Address invoices without POs or with unresolved discrepancies.
	- Work with department heads to create retrospective POs or reject the invoice if necessary.

**Sequence Flow:**

1. **Start:** Invoice is received (via email).
2. The Accounts Payable Clerk validates the invoice:
	- If the PO is missing  Task 2 (Request Supplier Clarification).
	- If the PO exists  Continue to Task 3 (Confirm Goods/Services Receipt).
3. Purchasing Officer confirms the receipt of goods/services.
4. The Accounts Payable Clerk matches the invoice to the PO:
	- If items match  Continue to Task 6 (Approve Invoice).
	- If discrepancies exist  Task 5 (Resolve Discrepancies):
		- If resolution is achieved  Return to Task 4 (Match Invoice to PO).
		- If escalation is required  Task 8 (Handle Exceptions).
5. After matching and resolving discrepancies:
	- The Department Manager reviews and approves the invoice.
	- If the manager rejects the invoice  Return to Task 8 (Handle Exceptions).
6. **End:** Approved invoice is scheduled for payment by the Accounts Payable Clerk.

**Gateways/Decision Points:**

- **Gateway 1:** (After Task 1)
	- Condition: Does the invoice have a valid PO?
		- **Yes:** Proceed to Task 3.
		- **No:** Task 2 (Request Supplier Clarification).
- **Gateway 2:** (After Task 4)
	- Condition: Do the invoice line items match the PO?
		- **Yes:** Proceed to Task 6 (Approve Invoice).
		- **No:** Task 5 (Resolve Discrepancies).
- **Gateway 3:** (After Task 6)
	- Condition: Is the invoice approved by the Department Manager?
		- **Yes:** Proceed to Task 7 (Schedule Payment).
		- **No:** Task 8 (Handle Exceptions).

**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**

- **Input:** Invoice (received via email).
- **Output:** Approved invoice scheduled for payment.
- **Supporting Data:**
	- Purchase Order (PO).
	- Supplier Clarifications (if applicable).
	- Confirmation of goods/services receipt.
	- Exception handling notes (for escalated cases).

**Exceptions/Variations:**

1. **Missing PO Number:**
	- Accounts Payable Clerk sends the invoice to the supplier for correction.
	- Supplier Relationship Manager may intervene to obtain the PO number.
2. **Invoice Discrepancy:**
	- Accounts Payable Clerk emails the Purchasing team.
	- If unresolved, escalates to Supervisor.
3. **Rejected Invoice:**
	- Department Manager rejects the invoice, triggering exception handling.
4. **Informal Invoices (No PO):**
	- Supervisor works with department heads to create retrospective POs or reject the invoice.

**Notes on Ambiguity:**

- **Unclear Handoffs:**
	- Purchasing Officer assumes the invoice progresses to the Department Manager after confirmation but does not explicitly confirm this.
- **System Dependencies:**
	- The automatic email notification system triggers the manager’s approval, but no specific system details are provided.
