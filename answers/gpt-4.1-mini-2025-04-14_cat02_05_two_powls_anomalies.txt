Let's begin by recalling the typical **Hire-to-Retire** workflow steps and their logical sequence:

**Typical normative flow:**
1. Post job advertisement.
2. Screen candidates.
3. Conduct interviews.
4. Make hiring decision.
5. Onboard the hired employee.
6. Add employee to payroll.
7. Close the case.

## Step 1: Analyze Both Models

---

### **POWL Model 1:**

```python
Post = Transition(label="Post_Job_Ad")
Screen = Transition(label="Screen_Candidates")
Interview = Transition(label="Conduct_Interviews")
Decide = Transition(label="Make_Hiring_Decision")
Onboard = Transition(label="Onboard_Employee")
Payroll = Transition(label="Add_to_Payroll")
Close = Transition(label="Close_Case")

model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close])
model1.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview)
model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard)
model1.order.add_edge(Onboard, Payroll)
model1.order.add_edge(Payroll, Close)
```

- **Order relations:**
  - Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates
  - Screen_Candidates  Make_Hiring_Decision
  - Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews (parallel with Decide since there's no order between Decide and Interview)
  - Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee
  - Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll
  - Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case

---

### Observations on Model 1:
- The **Interview** activity depends only on that candidates are screened, but **does not depend on the hiring decision**.
- The **Make_Hiring_Decision** happens **in parallel with Conduct_Interviews** rather than after interviews conclude.
- Usually, the decision should be made **after interviews**, not potentially concurrenly or even before interviews conclude.
- The process strictly orders **Screen before both Interview and Decide**, but **Interview and Decide are unordered (parallel)**.
- All other steps seem well ordered in the sequence.

---

### **POWL Model 2:**

```python
Post = Transition(label="Post_Job_Ad")
Screen = Transition(label="Screen_Candidates")
Interview = Transition(label="Conduct_Interviews")
Decide = Transition(label="Make_Hiring_Decision")
Onboard = Transition(label="Onboard_Employee")
Payroll = Transition(label="Add_to_Payroll")
Close = Transition(label="Close_Case")
skip = SilentTransition()

loop_onboarding = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Onboard, skip])
xor_payroll = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Payroll, skip])

model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close])
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Interview)
model2.order.add_edge(Interview, Decide)
model2.order.add_edge(Decide, loop_onboarding)
model2.order.add_edge(loop_onboarding, xor_payroll)
model2.order.add_edge(xor_payroll, Close)
```

- **Order relations:**
  - Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates
  - Post_Job_Ad  Conduct_Interviews (parallel with Screen)
  - Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision
  - Make_Hiring_Decision  loop_onboarding
  - loop_onboarding  xor_payroll
  - xor_payroll  Close_Case

- **Loop on Onboarding step:**  
  Allows the Onboard_Employee activity to be repeated zero or more times:  
  Essentially `(Onboard, skip)*`, meaning onboarding can be skipped or repeated, going back to onboarding.

- **XOR choice on Payroll step:**  
  Allows either Add_to_Payroll to be executed or skipped before closing.

---

### Observations on Model 2:

- The **Post_Job_Ad** enables **Screening** and **Interviews** in parallel.  
  - Typically, interviews happen **after screening**, not concurrently with job posting.
- Onboarding can **repeat arbitrarily or be skipped entirely**: Anomalous because onboarding is usually a one-time activity.
- The Payroll activity can be **skipped**, which is anomalous since adding the employee to payroll is mandatory for hire-to-retire.
- There's no explicit order requiring **Screening to finish before Interviews start**, breaking typical sequencing.
- The use of silent transitions (skip) allows highly flexible or even skipped activities leading to potential incomplete cases.

---

## Step 2: Identify Anomalies in Each Model

---

**Model 1 Anomalies:**

1. **Interview and Make Decision run in parallel:** The hiring decision should be made after interview results.
2. No explicit dependency to ensure interviews finish before decision; this is a major logical flaw.
3. Otherwise, the process is linear and complete with all activities.

---

**Model 2 Anomalies:**

1. **Interviewing starts immediately after posting the job, even before screening candidates:** breaking typical logical order.
2. **Onboarding loop allowing multiple or zero onboarding executions:** onboard usually is done once.
3. **Payroll is optional (can be skipped):** mandatory activity missing breaks process correctness.
4. Parallelism between post and interview; ignoring screenings dependencies.
5. High flexibility leads to possible skipping of critical activities.

---

## Step 3: Decide Which Model Closer to Normative Process

---

| Aspect                         | Model 1                                | Model 2                                |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Maintains logical order of posting  screening  interview  decision? | Mostly, but decision can happen parallel to interviews (flawed) | No, interviews start immediately after posting, ignoring screening |
| Mandatory activities            | All activities present and included  | Payroll and Onboarding can be skipped (anomalous) |
| Process deviations severity    | Moderate (decision before interview completion is illogical) | Severe (allowing skipping onboarding and payroll) |
| Flexibility impacting correctness | Low (tasks fixed, but ordering issue) | High (skipping payroll is a major process flaw) |

---

### **Conclusion**

**Model 1** is closer to the normative Hire-to-Retire process because:

- It maintains the full activity set without skipping mandatory steps.
- The main anomaly is the lack of strict ordering between interview and decision, which presents a logical flaw but does not fundamentally break the process.
- The rest of the process follows a reasonable ordering pattern.

**Model 2** introduces more severe anomalies by:

- Allowing skipping of onboarding and payroll steps—critical for employee integration and salary management.
- Initiating interviews before screening candidates.
- Allowing repeated onboarding, which is not standard.

These deviations fundamentally violate the essence of the employee hiring workflow and process integrity.

---

# **Summary:**

| Model | Main Anomalies | Severity | Overall Normativity Alignment |
|--------|----------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| Model 1 | Interview and decision run in parallel (decision may be premature) | Moderate | **Closer to normative**; no missing mandatory steps |
| Model 2 | Interview before screening; onboarding loop; payroll skipped | Severe | Deviates significantly from normative process |

Model 1 is a better representation of a Hire-to-Retire process despite some ordering issues, whereas Model 2 shows fundamental process anomalies that impair correctness and completeness.
