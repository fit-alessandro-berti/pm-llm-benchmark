### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

#### Using Event Log Data and Process Mining Techniques

To identify and quantify the impact of instance-spanning constraints, we can employ the following process mining techniques:

1. **Discovery and Conformance Checking:**
   - Use discovery algorithms (e.g., Alpha algorithm, Inductive Miner) to create an initial process model from the event log.
   - Conformance checking can then be applied to identify deviations from the expected process flow, highlighting areas where constraints like resource contention or batching delays are causing issues.

2. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Analyze the duration between activities to identify bottlenecks. For example, long waiting times between "Item Picking" and "Packing” may indicate contention for packing stations.
   - Use filtering to isolate specific scenarios, such as orders requiring cold-packing or containing hazardous materials, to understand their unique impact.

3. **Resource Utilization Analysis:**
   - Examine the utilization patterns of shared resources (e.g., Cold-Packing stations) to identify periods of high demand and potential bottlenecks.
   - Use queueing theory to model waiting times and resource contention.

4. **Batch Analysis:**
   - Track the formation and completion of batches to understand the delays caused by waiting for other orders to join the batch.
   - Analyze the frequency and size of batches to identify opportunities for optimization.

#### Metrics to Measure Impact

- **Waiting Time:**
  - Measure the average waiting time for orders at each step, particularly focusing on shared resources like Cold-Packing stations.
  - Calculate the waiting time specifically for orders requiring cold-packing vs. standard packing.

- **Batch Formation Time:**
  - Measure the time elapsed from when the first order in a batch is ready for shipping to when the last order in the batch is ready.
  - Track the average and maximum batch formation times for different regions.

- **Priority Handling Delays:**
  - Measure the delay caused to standard orders when express orders preempt resources.
  - Track the frequency and duration of interruptions caused by express orders.

- **Throughput Reduction:**
  - Measure the throughput of orders containing hazardous materials and compare it to the throughput of standard orders.
  - Analyze the impact of the regulatory limit on the overall processing capacity.

#### Differentiating Waiting Times

- **Within-Instance Factors:**
  - Use activity duration metrics to identify long processing times within individual activities.
  - Compare the average duration of activities for different order types (e.g., standard vs. express).

- **Between-Instance Factors:**
  - Measure the time between the completion of one activity and the start of the next activity for different orders.
  - Use resource-specific logs to identify when a resource is occupied by another order, causing delays.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

#### Potential Interactions Between Constraints

1. **Priority Handling and Cold-Packing:**
   - Express orders requiring cold-packing can exacerbate contention for limited Cold-Packing stations, leading to longer waiting times for both express and standard orders.
   - This interaction can be analyzed by tracking the frequency of express orders requiring cold-packing and their impact on queue lengths.

2. **Batching and Hazardous Material Limits:**
   - If multiple orders containing hazardous materials are destined for the same region, batching them together may lead to violations of the regulatory limit.
   - This can be analyzed by examining the composition of batches and the frequency of hazardous material orders within them.

3. **Priority Handling and Batching:**
   - Express orders may disrupt the formation of batches, as they need to be expedited regardless of batch readiness.
   - This interaction can be analyzed by tracking the frequency of batch disruptions caused by express orders and their impact on batch formation times.

#### Importance of Understanding Interactions

Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective optimization strategies. For example, if priority handling frequently disrupts batching, a dynamic batching strategy that accounts for express orders could be implemented. Similarly, if cold-packing stations are a frequent bottleneck, increasing their capacity or optimizing their use could significantly improve throughput.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

### 4. Simulation and Validation
