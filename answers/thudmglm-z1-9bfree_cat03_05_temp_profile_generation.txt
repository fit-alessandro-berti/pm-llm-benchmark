**Explanation:**  
- **Consecutive pairs** (e.g., `('OP', 'RC')`): Reflect immediate transitions with predictable average times and standard deviations. For example, (`SS`) to (`OP`) takes ~2 hours (7200 seconds) with variability (1800 seconds).  
- **Intermediate non-consecutive pairs** (e.g., `('OP', 'CA')`): Sum of delays across intermediate steps. For example, the average time from `OP` to_subs (`CA`) includes procurement, inspection, and assembly delays.  
- **Long-term pairs** (e.g., `('SS', 'AS')`): Aggregates delays across the entire supply chain (30 days average for after-sales support).  
- **Standard deviations** increase with more steps (e.g., `('DT', 'AS')` has a large std due to post-shipping variability like customer support timelines).  

This dictionary captures the cascading nature of delays in a global supply chain and emphasizes variability from short-term operational hiccups to long-term logistical factors.
