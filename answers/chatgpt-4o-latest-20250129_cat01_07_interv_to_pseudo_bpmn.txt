### **BPMN-Like Textual Process Model for Invoice Approval Process**

#### **Participants:**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)**
- **Purchasing Officer**
- **Department Manager**
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor**
- **Supplier Relationship Manager**
- **Supplier**
- **System (Automated Notifications & Logging)**

---

### **Process Steps & Flow:**

1. **Invoice Receipt (Start Event)**
   - Trigger: Supplier sends invoice (usually via email).
   - **Accounts Payable Clerk** receives the invoice.

2. **PO Check (Decision Gateway)**
   - **AP Clerk** verifies if the invoice includes a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
   - **If PO is missing**, the invoice is returned to the **Supplier** with a request for details → **Process restarts when the corrected invoice is received**.
   - **If PO is present**, the invoice is logged into the **Accounting System**.

3. **Goods/Service Receipt Confirmation (Task)**
   - **AP Clerk** forwards the invoice to **Purchasing Officer** to confirm that goods/services were received as per PO.

4. **Invoice-Purchase Order Matching (Task)**
   - **Purchasing Officer** verifies that invoice details (quantities, pricing, charges) match the PO.
   - If there are discrepancies:
     - **Minor Issues (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items)** → **Purchasing Officer** requests clarification from **Supplier** or asks **AP Clerk** to hold the invoice.
     - **Major Issues (e.g., no PO exists, unrecognized charges)** → **Escalate to AP Supervisor** for resolution.

5. **Escalation Handling (Exception Path)**
   - **AP Supervisor** intervenes in case of unresolved discrepancies.
   - **Supplier Relationship Manager** may be involved in clarifications with **Supplier**.
   - **Possible Outcomes**:
     - PO is retrospectively created (for informal service contracts).
     - Invoice is rejected if it cannot be matched.
     - Issue is resolved and the invoice continues in the process.

6. **Manager Approval (Task)**
   - **Once Purchasing confirms receipt and invoice matching is complete**, the **System** triggers an approval request to the **Department Manager**.
   - **Department Manager** reviews invoice details against budget and any notes from prior steps.
   - **If no concerns**, they approve the invoice.
   - **If concerns arise**, they may:
     - Reject the invoice (back to **AP Clerk** for investigation).
     - Request a hold for further verification.

7. **Payment Scheduling (Task)**
   - **Once approved**, the invoice is sent back to **AP Clerk** for final processing.
   - Invoice is added to the **next payment cycle**.

8. **Invoice Payment (End Event)**
   - Payment is processed according to the scheduled cycle.

### **Gateways/Decision Points:**
1. **Invoice Has PO?**
   - Yes → Proceed to logging & matching.
   - No → Return to supplier.

2. **Invoice Matches PO & Received Goods?**
   - Yes → Proceed to manager approval.
   - No → Seek resolution (supplier clarification, retrospective PO, escalation).

3. **Manager Approval?**
   - Yes → Proceed to payment scheduling.
   - No → Hold or investigate discrepancies.

---

### **Exceptions & Variations:**
- **Invoice with no PO:** Requires supplier follow-up or retrospective PO creation.
- **Discrepancies in amount or details:** Either supplier correction, internal investigation, or escalation.
- **Manager flags an issue:** May lead to further inquiries before approval.

This structured model captures the invoice approval workflow, decision points, role handoffs, and exception handling mechanisms. It can be directly mapped to a **BPMN diagram** by visualizing tasks, gateways, and message flows.
