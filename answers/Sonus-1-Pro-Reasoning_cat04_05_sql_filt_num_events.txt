Certainly! Here is the draft prompt for the benchmark, along with a detailed explanation and the final SQL query:

Draft Prompt for the Benchmark
Prompt:

Assume you have an event log stored in a DuckDB table named event_log, with each row representing a single event. The table has at least the following columns: case_id, activity, and timestamp. Each case_id groups events that belong to a single process instance (or 'case').

Your task: Please craft a DuckDB SQL query that filters out any cases containing more than six events, and returns only the events from cases that have six or fewer events in total.

In other words, the query should identify the number of events per case_id, exclude any case_id where this count is greater than six, and then return the full set of events for the remaining cases. Be sure to consider the correct grouping and filtering to achieve this result.

Detailed Explanation
Identify the Number of Events per Case:

Use a window function to count the number of events for each case_id.
Filter Cases with More Than Six Events:

Exclude any case_id where the count of events is greater than six.
Return the Full Set of Events for the Remaining Cases:

Select all events from the cases that have six or fewer events.
Solution Code
sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count
  FROM event_log
) subquery
WHERE event_count <= 6;
Explanation of the Query
Window Function:

The inner query uses COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) to add a new column event_count to each row, which represents the total number of events for that case_id.
Filtering:

The outer query selects only those rows where event_count is less than or equal to six, effectively filtering out cases with more than six events.
Example
Suppose the event_log table has the following rows:

case_id	activity	timestamp
1	A	2023-01-01
1	B	2023-01-02
2	C	2023-01-03
2	D	2023-01-04
2	E	2023-01-05
3	F	2023-01-06
3	G	2023-01-07
3	H	2023-01-08
3	I	2023-01-09
Case 1 has 2 events.
Case 2 has 3 events.
Case 3 has 4 events.
If we set the threshold to 3, then cases 1 and 2 should be included in full, while case 3 should be excluded entirely.

Applying the query:

sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count
  FROM event_log
) subquery
WHERE event_count <= 3;
This will return all events from cases 1 and 2, but exclude case 3, which has 4 events.

Final Query for the Task
sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count
  FROM event_log
) subquery
WHERE event_count <= 6;
This query ensures that only the events from cases with six or fewer events are returned, meeting the specified criteria.
