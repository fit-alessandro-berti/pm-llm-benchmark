Applying decomposition strategies can be highly beneficial for large-scale process mining projects, but they also come with their own set of challenges. Here are the main benefits and challenges:

**Benefits:**

1. **Scalability**: Decomposition allows you to break down a large, complex process into smaller, manageable subprocesses. This makes it easier to handle big data and perform analysis on each subprocess individually.

2. **Improved Visualization**: Smaller subprocesses are easier to visualize and understand than one large, complex process. This can lead to better insights and more effective communication of findings.

3. **Focused Analysis**: By decomposing the process, you can focus your analysis on specific parts of the process where issues or inefficiencies might be occurring. This targeted approach can lead to more actionable results.

4. **Easier Model Building**: Smaller subprocesses are easier to model and predict than a large, complex process. This can improve the accuracy of predictive models.

5. **Better Resource Allocation**: By understanding each subprocess in detail, you can allocate resources more effectively within the overall process.

**Challenges:**

1. **Identifying Appropriate Decomposition Points**: Determining where to decompose the process can be challenging. If done incorrectly, it can lead to subprocesses that are still too complex or don't represent meaningful parts of the overall process.

2. **Data Consistency**: When decomposing a process, you need to ensure that data is consistent across subprocess boundaries. This can be difficult to achieve in practice, especially in large-scale projects with diverse data sources.

3. **Maintaining Context**: While decomposition provides detailed insights into individual subprocesses, it can make it harder to maintain context and understand how these subprocesses interact with each other within the overall process.

4. **Complexity of Reassembly**: After analyzing each subprocess, reassembling the findings into a coherent picture of the entire process can be complex. It's important to ensure that insights from individual subprocesses are correctly integrated into the overall view.

5. **Validation and Verification**: Validating and verifying results across decomposed processes can be challenging. Ensuring that the sum of the parts equals the whole is crucial but can be difficult to achieve in practice.

6. **Tool Support**: Not all process mining tools support decomposition strategies out-of-the-box, which can limit the feasibility of these approaches in some projects.

In conclusion, while decomposition strategies offer significant benefits for large-scale process mining projects, they also present challenges that need to be carefully managed.
