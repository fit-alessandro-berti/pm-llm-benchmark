This visualization shows a series of business process flow diagrams designed to track and manage the process of order management and customer progress within a company. It is composed of several connected diagrams, each representing different stages or components of the business process. The main stages and elements are described below:

- **Sales Workflow (Monday Morning, Order Details, Crafting Order, System to draft an order)**
  - This flow starts when the customer has made an order on a Monday morning.
  - A check is conducted to see if the customer has already placed an order.
  - If the customer is not already in the database, their details are added.
  - Order details are then sent to the relevant departments or systems.

- **Creation Process (On Monday)**
  - Customer information is validated or verified.
  - Production plans are formulated based on that information.
  - Manufacture of the product detailed within those plans is carried out.

- **Production (Process Completion)**
  - Detailed production activities occur, and materials that are not faulty are used.
  - An order for these materials is placed if they're not already in the inventory (from a drawn-in diagram).

- **Procurement Process**
  - When a need for materials is confirmed, procurement processes are initiated.
  - Materials from a previous order that have not failed quality checks are returned to the system.
  - Additionally, a cancellation option for orders exists if the materials cannot be used.

- **Order Fulfillment and Production Completion Processes**
  - For non-faulty materials, the fulfillment process occurs within the warehouse.
  - The subsequent stages involve sending the completed product to the customers, highlighted by sending green product signs.

The diagrams represent detailed, interconnected steps that involve database checks, procurement, production, and sales processes, which outline how an order from a customer becomes a successfully fulfilled product, ready for shipment. The dashes, lines, and bubbles are all part of standard notations in flowchart representations.
