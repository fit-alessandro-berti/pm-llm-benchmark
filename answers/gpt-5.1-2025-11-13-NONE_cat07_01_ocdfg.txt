This visualization shows a crossprocess flow chart for an ordertocash / purchasetopay scenario. It combines several related object types and their activities into one endtoend process.

**Top layer – object types and starting points**
- Across the top are five object types, each with a count of instances:
  - VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M objects)
  - ReturnOrderItem (0.8M)
  - PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M)
  - SalesOrderItem (3.5M)
  - PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M)  
- Under each is a “Start” node. From these starts, colored paths (different colors per object type) flow downward through the process.

**Main activities and flow**
Activities are rectangular nodes with:
- A label (e.g., “Create Requisition”, “Approve Payment”, “Ship Goods”).
- A small colored dot legend indicating which object types pass through that activity.
- An “Overall” volume, e.g., “Overall: 8.5M”, representing how many events or cases reach that step.

Key branches:
- From purchase requisitions:
  - “Create Requisition”  “Approve Requisition”.
  - From “Approve Requisition” flows branch to:
    - “Send Order”
    - “Check Stock”
    - “Process Return”
    - “Approve Payment”  “Create Invoice”
- From sales orders:
  - “Create Order”  “Pack Goods”  “Ship Goods”  “Confirm Delivery”  “Close Order”.
- Vendor invoices and returns also join the shared midprocess steps such as “Process Return”, “Approve Payment”, and “Create Invoice”.

**Edges and performance metrics**
- Arrows show the direction of flow between activities.
- Along each arrow is a time annotation (e.g., 300 ms, 600 ms, 2,000 ms). This indicates the average processing or waiting time between the two steps.
- Multiple colored edges may connect the same activities, showing different object types following the same transition with their own timing.

**End states**
- Several “End” ovals at the bottom mark where different paths terminate (e.g., after “Send Order”, “Create Invoice”, “Close Order”).

Overall, the diagram is a multiobject process map that visualizes how different business objects (orders, returns, requisitions, invoices) interact across shared activities, including both throughput volumes (“Overall: xM”) and average transition times in milliseconds.
