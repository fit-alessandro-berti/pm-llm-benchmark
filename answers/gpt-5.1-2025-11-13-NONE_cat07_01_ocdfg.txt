This visualization is a process-flow diagram showing several related business workflows and their performance.

Key aspects:

1. **Multiple object types at the top**  
   - VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M objects)  
   - ReturnOrderItem (0.8M)  
   - PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M)  
   - SalesOrderItem (3.5M)  
   - PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M)  

   Each has its own **Start** node, indicating the beginning of that process stream.

2. **Activities (rectangles)**  
   Boxes represent steps in the processes, each labeled with an action and the total number of cases (“Overall”). Examples:
   - Create Requisition (3.0M)  
   - Approve Requisition (5.7M)  
   - Create Order (8.5M)  
   - Pack Goods (2.0M)  
   - Ship Goods (1.8M)  
   - Confirm Delivery (1.7M)  
   - Process Return (0.8M)  
   - Approve Payment (1.5M)  
   - Create Invoice (2.0M)  
   - Send Order (5.2M)  
   - Close Order (1.7M)

3. **Flows and paths (colored arrows)**  
   - Arrows connect activities, forming endtoend paths from Start to End.  
   - Different colors represent different object types or variants flowing through the same activities (for example, orders vs returns vs invoices).  
   - Next to many arrows are **timings in milliseconds (ms)**, indicating the average time between two steps (e.g., 400 ms from Create Order to Approve Requisition).

4. **Shared and converging steps**  
   - Several streams converge on common activities like **Approve Requisition**, **Process Return**, **Approve Payment**, and **Create Invoice**, showing that different document types eventually go through shared approval and invoicing stages.
   - From there, flows split again toward different **End** nodes at the bottom, showing multiple possible completion points.

5. **End nodes**  
   Ellipses labeled **End** mark where each path finishes, often after steps like Send Order, Create Invoice, or Close Order, with timings for the last transition.

Overall, the diagram depicts an integrated ordertocash / procuretopay process, enriched with volume metrics (number of objects per activity) and performance metrics (average transition times) for several interlinked document types.
