To optimize the given Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) for reduced turnaround times and increased flexibility in handling non-standard requests, we'll redesign the process by integrating automation, dynamic resource allocation, and predictive analytics. Here's a proposed redesign:

1. **Predictive Analytics Integration:**
   - Implement machine learning models that analyze historical data to identify patterns indicative of standard vs. non-standard requests. This could be done in an 'Analytics Gateway' before the Start Event, which dynamically sets initial process branches based on prediction confidence levels.

   *Impact*: Reduces manual intervention and improves initial routing accuracy. 

2. **Automated Initial Request Assessment:**
   - Replace Task A ("Receive Customer Request") with "Automated Request Categorization" using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess request type, potentially tagging as Standard/Custom/Unclear. This will help in deciding the initial path more accurately.

3. **Dynamic Resource Allocation:**
   - Introduce a 'Resource Allocation Task' post-Categorization that dynamically assigns resources based on current system load and predicted resource needs inferred from predictive analytics.

   *Impact*: Enhances efficiency by ensuring the right resources are allocated at the right time, reducing idle times and wait states.

4. **Adaptive Parallel Processing:**
   - Modify 'Run Parallel Checks' to include an adaptive mechanism where the number and type of checks performed (e.g., more extensive for custom requests) can dynamically adjust based on request categorization and real-time resource availability.

   *Impact*: Streamlines processing, ensuring neither over- nor under-processing for different request types.

5. **Proactive Custom Path Management:**
   - Introduce a 'Custom Feasibility Analysis Loop' that continuously monitors the progress of custom requests, revisits predictive models, and triggers early intervention if deviations from standard paths are anticipated (e.g., additional checks or consultations).

   *Impact*: Minimizes surprises and reduces customer dissatisfaction by ensuring timely handling of complex cases.

6. **Predictive Approval Pathways:**
   - Incorporate an 'Approval Prediction Task' that uses historical data to predict approval likelihood for both standard and custom paths, guiding the process towards either seeking immediate or deferred approvals as needed.

   *Impact*: Reduces delays caused by unnecessary manager involvement while ensuring compliance with organizational policies.

7. **Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement:**
   - After 'Generate Final Invoice', introduce a 'Feedback Collection' subprocess that gathers customer satisfaction metrics and process performance indicators for ongoing model refinement and process tuning.

   *Impact*: Ensures the process remains responsive to changing needs and maintains high service quality standards through iterative improvements.

**Overall Effects:**
- **Performance**: Reduced turnaround times due to proactive resource allocation, adaptive parallel processing, and predictive routing minimizing unnecessary delays.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Enhanced through accurate initial categorization, fewer surprises with custom requests managed proactively, and swift resolution facilitated by continuous improvement loops.
- **Operational Complexity**: Increased initially due to the integration of predictive models and automation tools; however, long-term benefits like reduced manual intervention, better resource management, and dynamic adaptability counterbalance this, leading to a more efficient, responsive system.
