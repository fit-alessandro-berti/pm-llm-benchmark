Here are 20 relevant questions about the ultrasound-guided central line insertion process, with confidence scores (0-100%) based on how clearly the process model supports the question:

1. Does hand washing precede getting into sterile clothes? (Confidence: 100%)

2. Is ultrasound probe preparation (gel and cover) completed before patient positioning? (Confidence: 100%)

3. Are there three different methods of vessel identification used in the process? (Confidence: 95%)

4. Does blood return verification occur after the initial puncture? (Confidence: 100%)

5. Is wire position checked in both long and short axis views? (Confidence: 100%)

6. Does cleaning the puncture area occur before draping? (Confidence: 100%)

7. Is anesthesia administered after vessel identification but before puncture? (Confidence: 95%)

8. Must the guidewire be confirmed in good position before advancing the catheter? (Confidence: 90%)

9. Is there a mandatory flow and reflow check after catheter placement? (Confidence: 100%)

10. Does the process require removal of the trocar before guidewire installation? (Confidence: 85%)

11. Are sterile implements prepared at the very beginning of the procedure? (Confidence: 100%)

12. Is ultrasound configuration completed before applying gel to the probe? (Confidence: 100%)

13. Can vessel identification methods be performed in parallel? (Confidence: 90%)

14. Is there a final position check of the catheter before completing the procedure? (Confidence: 100%)

15. Does the process require dropping the probe before removing the syringe? (Confidence: 90%)

16. Is pathway widening an optional step in the process? (Confidence: 85%)

17. Are there multiple decision points that could lead to procedure repetition? (Confidence: 90%)

18. Is sterile gel applied after covering the probe but before positioning it? (Confidence: 100%)

19. Does the removal of the guidewire occur after advancing the catheter? (Confidence: 100%)

20. Is patient positioning done after ultrasound preparation but before vessel identification? (Confidence: 100%)

These questions cover various aspects of the procedure including preparation, safety checks, sequential steps, and critical decision points. The confidence scores reflect how explicitly the information is represented in the BPMN model.
