Here is a DuckDB SQL query that fulfills the requirements of the benchmark, with `K` as a parameter you can set (e.g., 5 for the top 5 most frequent variants). The query:

1. Orders activities within each `case_id` by `timestamp` to define the process variant.
2. Constructs the variant as a list (or array) of activities in execution order.
3. Counts how many cases follow each variant.
4. Identifies the top K most frequent variants.
5. Filters the original event log to include only events from cases that belong to one of these top K variants.

```sql
-- Set the value of K (e.g., top 5 variants)
-- You can replace ?K? with a literal number or use a parameter if supported in your environment
-- For this example, we'll use 5 as K; adjust as needed.

WITH ordered_activities AS (
    -- Step 1: Order activities within each case by timestamp
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LIST(activity) OVER (
            PARTITION BY case_id 
            ORDER BY timestamp 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
        ) AS variant_sequence
    FROM event_log
),
-- Extract one variant_sequence per case (since it's repeated per row)
case_variants AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id,
        variant_sequence
    FROM ordered_activities
),
-- Step 2: Group by variant_sequence to count frequency
variant_frequency AS (
    SELECT 
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant_sequence
),
-- Step 3: Get the top K variants by frequency
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT variant_sequence
    FROM variant_frequency
    ORDER BY variant_count DESC
    LIMIT 5  -- Replace 5 with desired K
)
-- Step 4: Join back to original log to get all events from cases in top K variants
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN case_variants cv ON el.case_id = cv.case_id
INNER JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON cv.variant_sequence = tkv.variant_sequence
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

###  Explanation:

- **`ordered_activities`**: Uses the `LIST()` window function (DuckDB’s equivalent of array aggregation) over a timestamp-ordered partition to build the full activity sequence per case.
- **`case_variants`**: Deduplicates to get one variant per case.
- **`variant_frequency`**: Counts how many cases have each unique sequence.
- **`top_k_variants`**: Selects the K most frequent variants.
- Final `SELECT`: Retrieves **all original events** from cases whose variant is in the top K.

---

###  Notes:

- DuckDB supports `LIST()` as an ordered aggregate in window functions, which is crucial here.
- The `variant_sequence` is an ordered list (array) of activities, so two cases with the same sequence in the same order will have equal `variant_sequence`.
- The final result includes **all columns** from `event_log` (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) for events in top-K-variant cases.
- Replace `LIMIT 5` with your desired `K`.

---

###  Example: Setting K = 3

Change this line:
```sql
LIMIT 5
```
to:
```sql
LIMIT 3
```

This will return events only from cases that follow the 3 most frequent process variants.

This query is efficient and leverages DuckDB’s window functions and list support effectively.
