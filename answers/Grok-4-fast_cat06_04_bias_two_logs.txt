### Comparison of Event Logs

The two event logs document the processing of loan or application cases for two groups: Group A (Protected Group, e.g., potentially a minority or disadvantaged demographic) and Group B (Unprotected Group, e.g., a majority or advantaged demographic). Both logs follow a similar workflow: ApplicationReceived → DataValidation → PreliminaryScoring → ManualReview → FinalDecision. Key attributes include `LocalResident` (TRUE/FALSE), `CommunityGroup` (specific affiliation or None), `PreliminaryScore` (initial credit-like score), `ScoreAdjustment` (any modifications), and `Decision` (Approved/Rejected). Resources like Automated Sys, Checker, Scoring Engine, Underwriter, and Rules Engine are consistent across logs.

At a high level:
- **Group A (Protected)**: 3 cases (P001–P003), all with `LocalResident = FALSE` and `CommunityGroup = None`. Preliminary scores range from 710–740. No score adjustments occur. Decisions: 2 Approved (720, 740), 1 Rejected (710).
- **Group B (Unprotected)**: 3 cases (U001–U003), all with `LocalResident = TRUE`. `CommunityGroup` is "Highland Civic Darts Club" for U001/U003 (boost applied) and None for U002. Preliminary scores range from 695–720. Adjustments occur only for community-affiliated cases. Decisions: 2 Approved (730 adjusted from 720; 705 adjusted from 695), 1 Rejected (710, no adjustment).

| Aspect | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **LocalResident** | All FALSE | All TRUE |
| **CommunityGroup Usage** | All None (no affiliations noted) | 2/3 cases: "Highland Civic Darts Club" (eligible for boost); 1/3: None |
| **Score Adjustments** | None (all 0 or N/A) | +10 "Community Boost" for affiliated cases; 0 for non-affiliated |
| **Adjusted Scores** | Same as preliminary (710–740) | 730 (from 720), 705 (from 695), 710 (unchanged) |
| **Approval Rate** | 67% (2/3) | 67% (2/3) |
| **Score Threshold Insight** | ≥720 → Approved; 710 → Rejected (suggests ~715 threshold) | 710 (no boost) → Rejected; but 705 (boosted) → Approved (inconsistent with Group A) |

### Identification of Bias
The **Group B log (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias**. This is evident from the preferential treatment in scoring and decision-making that favors applicants with certain attributes, creating an uneven playing field compared to Group A. The bias is **algorithmic and procedural**, embedded in the Scoring Engine and Rules Engine, where positive adjustments and lenient thresholds disproportionately benefit Group B applicants. Group A's log, by contrast, shows a neutral, consistent process without such interventions, highlighting the disparity.

### How the Bias Manifests
The bias primarily manifests through the interplay of `LocalResident`, `CommunityGroup`, and `ScoreAdjustment`, leading to inflated scores and approvals for Group B that are not available to Group A. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Influence of LocalResident and CommunityGroup**:
   - `LocalResident = TRUE` in Group B acts as a proxy for eligibility in community-based perks, enabling access to `CommunityGroup` affiliations (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club"). This attribute triggers the "Community Boost" in PreliminaryScoring and carries through ManualReview and FinalDecision.
   - Group A, with `LocalResident = FALSE`, has no such affiliations (`CommunityGroup = None`), so they receive no boost. This creates a structural barrier: Protected Group members (e.g., non-residents or migrants) are less likely to participate in local civic groups, systematically excluding them from score enhancements.
   - Manifestation: In Group B, 2/3 cases leverage this for a +10 adjustment (U001: 720 → 730; U003: 695 → 705). U002 (no affiliation) mirrors Group A's neutrality but underscores that only affiliated Unprotected applicants benefit.

2. **Role of ScoreAdjustment Column**:
   - This column reveals explicit favoritism: Adjustments are labeled "+10 (Community Boost)" only in Group B's affiliated cases, applied consistently across stages (Scoring Engine originates it, Underwriter notes it as "Adjusted," Rules Engine finalizes it).
   - Group A has uniform "0" or N/A, indicating no equivalent mechanism (e.g., no "residency penalty" or alternative boost). This adjustment artificially elevates Group B scores by ~1.4–14% (e.g., +10 on 695 = +1.4%), pushing borderline cases over approval thresholds.

3. **Impact on Final Decisions**:
   - **Systematic Differences**: Even with comparable preliminary scores, Group B achieves higher approval rates for lower effective scores due to boosts and apparent threshold leniency. For instance:
     - P002 (Group A, 710, no adjustment) → Rejected.
     - U002 (Group B, 710, no adjustment) → Rejected (fair).
     - But U003 (Group B, 695 → 705) → Approved, despite 705 < 710. This suggests the Rules Engine applies a lower effective threshold (~700) for boosted Group B cases, or the boost overrides standard rules—neither applies to Group A.
   - Overall, the process amplifies small differences: A Protected applicant needs a higher baseline score (e.g., 720+) to approve, while an Unprotected one with community ties can approve at 695+ (post-boost). This could result in 20–30% fewer approvals for Group A over larger datasets, perpetuating disparities in resource access (e.g., loans).

### Broader Implications
These factors (`LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup`) likely stem from well-intentioned policies (e.g., rewarding civic engagement), but they inadvertently discriminate by assuming universal access to local networks—disadvantaging Protected Groups who may face barriers like relocation or exclusion. The `ScoreAdjustment` codifies this into the algorithm, making bias reproducible and scalable. To mitigate, the system could neutralize boosts for fairness (e.g., cap adjustments) or add inclusive alternatives (e.g., virtual community credits). Without intervention, this leads to unequal outcomes, eroding trust in automated decisions.
