<think>
First, I am considering the event log provided. It has three cases, each showing a sequence of activities. Let me list out the traces for each case:

- Case 1: RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC

- Case 2: RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC

- Case 3: RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC

From this, I see that the core sequence is RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC, but in some cases, there's an interruption where RMI and possibly repeated VF occur before proceeding to AD.

In Case 1 and Case 3, there's RMI followed by VF, and in Case 3, RMI is repeated twice before VF. Also, in Case 3, there are two RMI events before the VF.

Looking closely:

- Case 1: After AE, RMI, then VF, then AD.

- Case 2: No RMI, directly from AE to AD.

- Case 3: After AE, RMI, then another RMI, then VF, then AD.

So, the loop involves RMI and VF. In the loop, RMI can happen one or more times, and then VF is executed to re-validate.

In Case 1: AE  RMI  VF  AD

In Case 3: AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD

And in Case 2, no loop: AE  AD

Also, VF appears earlier in the sequence, right after RA.

The initial VF is always there, and the loop involves additional RMI and VF.

Let me think about the structure.

The process starts with RA, then VF, then AE.

After AE, there might be a loop where RMI is executed, and possibly multiple times, and then VF is re-executed, after which it proceeds to AD.

In the loop part, in Case 3, there are multiple RMI before VF, but VF is only executed once after the RMI(s).

In Case 1: one RMI, then one VF.

In Case 3: two RMI, then one VF.

So, perhaps the loop is on RMI, and after some RMI, VF is executed to exit the loop or something.

Recalling the process tree operators:

- -> (sequence): A before B

- X (xor): exclusive choice between A or B

- + (parallel): concurrent execution

- * (loop): A is executed, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

In the loop operator * (A, B), A is the "do" part, and B is the "redo" part. A is executed first, then you can choose to exit or execute B and then back to A.

But in this case, looking at the behavior:

After AE, in some cases, nothing happens, and it goes to AD.

In other cases, RMI is executed, and then VF, and then it might go back or proceed.

In the traces, after the loop part, it always goes to AD, no repetition after VF.

In Case 1 and 3, after VF (the second one), it goes directly to AD.

Also, in Case 3, there are multiple RMI before the VF.

Perhaps it's better to think of a loop where the body includes RMI and possibly multiple executions, but the loop operator in process trees is defined as * (A, B) where A is executed, then either exit or execute B and back to A.

But in this case, the repetition is on RMI, and VF seems to be part of exiting the loop.

Maybe A is the check or something.

Perhaps after AE, there's an optional loop that can be executed zero or more times, and each iteration involves RMI followed by VF.

But in the traces, when the loop is taken, it's RMI (one or more) followed by VF, then proceed.

In Case 3, there are two RMI and then one VF, so it's not that each iteration has RMI and VF; instead, RMI can repeat, and then VF is done once.

Perhaps RMI can be repeated in a loop, and after some RMI, VF is executed to break out.

But that might not fit perfectly.

Maybe there's a loop where B is RMI, and A is something else, but let's see.

Another way: perhaps after AE, there's an exclusive choice: either go directly to AD (if no missing info), or enter a loop where RMI and VF are executed, and the loop can be repeated.

But in the loop, is it repeating RMI and VF together?

In Case 1: RMI  VF  AD (so loop executed once)

In Case 3: RMI  RMI  VF  AD (here, if loop is on RMI, but VF is only once.

Perhaps the loop is specifically for RMI, and VF is part of the sequence after the loop.

Let's model it.

Suppose after AE, there is a loop * (something, RMI).

Recall * (A, B): execute A, then either exit or execute B and back to A.

For example, if A is VF, B is RMI, then it would be: execute VF first, then either exit or execute RMI and back to VF.

But in the traces, after AE, it's RMI first, then VF, not VF first.

In Case 1: AE  RMI  VF  AD

So RMI before VF.

If * (VF, RMI), it would start with VF, which is not the case.

Perhaps * (RMI, something).

Another idea: perhaps A is the body that includes RMI and a decision, but process trees have limited operators; I can't have complex bodies easily.

Perhaps use a sequence with a loop.

Let's think of the structure.

The main sequence is: RA  VF  AE  [loop part]  AD  SC  AC

The loop part can be: nothing (in Case 2), or RMI followed by VF (in Case 1 and 3), but in Case 3, multiple RMI before VF.

In Case 3, it's two RMI and then VF, so the RMI can repeat, and after some number, VF is done.

Perhaps the loop is on RMI, and VF is executed after the loop is exited.

In * (A, B), A is executed first, then loop.

But if I set A to be, say, a silent step or something, but typically A and B are subtrees.

Perhaps I can have after AE, a loop * (tau, RMI), but that would execute tau first, then either exit or execute RMI and back to tau, which might allow multiple RMI, but tau is silent, and then after loop, VF.

Let's see the behavior of * (A, B).

From the definition: execute A, then either exit, or execute B and then back to A.

So for * (A, B), possible traces: A, or A B A, or A B A B A, etc.

But in our case, for the loop part, in Case 2: no loop, so perhaps the choice to not enter the loop.

In process trees, the loop operator allows zero or more iterations, but * (A, B) always executes A at least once, then optionally repeats B and A.

From the prompt: "* ( A, B ) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again (this can happen several times until the loop is exited)."

So, A is always executed at least once, then after A, you decide to exit or do B and back to A.

In traces, it always starts with A, and A is executed in every iteration.

But in our loop part, when the loop is not taken (Case 2), nothing is executed; when taken, it starts with RMI or with VF?

In the traces, when loop is taken, it starts with RMI, ends with VF.

For example, in Case 1: RMI then VF.

In Case 3: RMI, RMI, VF.

So the first activity is RMI, last is VF in the loop part.

If I use * (VF, RMI), it would be VF first, then optionally RMI and back to VF, so traces like VF, or VF RMI VF, or VF RMI VF RMI VF, etc. But in our case, it's RMI first in some iterations? No, if * (VF, RMI), the shortest is VF, but in traces, when loop is present, it starts with RMI, not VF.

In Case 1, after AE, RMI then VF, no VF without RMI in the loop part.

In fact, the initial VF is already done before AE.

So the loop VF would be a second VF, but in * (VF, RMI), it could have VF without RMI, but in the log, when the loop is taken, there's always RMI before VF or something.

In Case 1: RMI then VF — so if * (VF, RMI), possible traces include VF (which would mean VF without RMI, but in log, when loop is executed, there's RMI), and also it could have multiple VF, but in log, VF is executed only once per loop execution in this context.

Perhaps better to have the loop on RMI.

Suppose * (RMI, something). If * (RMI, B), it executes RMI first, then either exit or execute B and back to RMI.

After RMI, it could exit or do B and RMI again.

In the traces, after some RMI, it does VF and then exits, not back to RMI directly.

In Case 3, after two RMI, it does VF, not another RMI without VF.

The decision to do VF comes after some RMI.

Perhaps B is VF, but * (RMI, VF) would be: execute RMI, then either exit or execute VF and back to RMI.

So traces: RMI (exit), or RMI VF RMI, or RMI VF RMI VF RMI, etc.

But in the log, we have sequences like RMI VF (Case 1), or RMI RMI VF (Case 3), but not RMI VF RMI, because after VF, it always goes to AD, no back to RMI.

In the traces, after VF in the loop part, it proceeds to AD, no repetition.

So the loop doesn't repeat after VF; it only repeats RMI before VF is done.

Perhaps it's not a standard loop.

Maybe use an exclusive choice after AE: either go to AD directly, or go to a sequence RMI  VF  and then back to the choice or something, but process trees don't have direct back edges; the loop operator is specifically for that.

Another way: perhaps after AE, there is a loop with A being the decision or something, but I need to use silent steps.

Silent steps (tau) can be used.

Perhaps I can have a loop * (tau, RMI), which would allow zero or more RMI, since * (tau, RMI) executes tau (silent), then either exit or execute RMI and back to tau, so possible traces: silent (do nothing), or silent RMI silent, or silent RMI silent RMI silent, etc, but the silent steps are not visible, so effectively, zero or more RMI can be executed.

Then after the loop, execute VF, then AD, etc.

In the traces, when RMI is executed, it's followed by VF, not that RMI can be alone.

In Case 2, no RMI and no VF in the loop part? No, in Case 2, after AE, directly to AD, so no additional VF or RMI.

But in the main sequence, there is already a VF after RA.

If I put a loop * (tau, RMI) after AE, then VF, then AD, let's see the traces:

- If loop not taken: after AE, VF, AD, etc.

But in Case 2, after AE, AD, no VF.

In Case 2, there is no second VF; only the first VF after RA.

In Case 1 and 3, there is a second VF after RMI.

In Case 1: activities: RA, VF (first), AE, RMI, VF (second), AD, SC, AC

In Case 2: RA, VF, AE, AD, SC, AC — only one VF

In Case 3: RA, VF, AE, RMI, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC — second VF

So the VF can be executed twice in some cases.

If I put after AE a loop that allows zero or more RMI, then a VF, then AD, then for Case 2: loop not taken (no RMI), then VF, but that would add an extra VF, which is not in Case 2.

In Case 2, there should be no VF after AE.

But in my proposed model, after loop (which could be empty), I have VF, so it would always execute VF after AE, but in Case 2, there is no VF after AE.

Problem.

Perhaps the VF is part of the loop.

Let's think of the point where the choice happens.

After AE, in some cases, directly to AD, in others, to RMI, and after RMI (possibly multiple), to VF, then to AD.

But VF is only executed if there was RMI.

Also, RMI can be zero times (in Case 2), but when zero, no VF; when one or more, then VF after the RMI(s).

In the loop, when there is RMI, it's followed by VF only once after the last RMI.

Perhaps I can model it as: after AE, exclusive choice: either -> AD, or * (RMI, tau) followed by VF then AD.

Let's see.

Using XOR choice.

After AE, X ( -> AD, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF, -> AD ) )

But that would be exclusive choice between: path 1: AD, or path 2: loop of RMI (with * (RMI, tau), which allows zero or more RMI? * (RMI, tau): execute RMI first, then either exit or execute tau and back to RMI. Since tau is silent, traces for * (RMI, tau): RMI (exit after RMI), or RMI tau RMI, or RMI tau RMI tau RMI, etc. So effectively, one or more RMI, with silent steps in between, but silent steps don't show, so one or more RMI.

Then followed by VF and AD.

So for the choice: either directly AD, or (one or more RMI followed by VF) then AD.

Now, in the traces:

- If choice is direct AD, trace: AD

- If choice is the other, trace: RMI+ VF AD (where RMI+ is one or more RMI)

But in Case 2: after AE, AD — good, no RMI, no VF.

In Case 1: after AE, RMI, VF, AD — which matches one RMI followed by VF.

In Case 3: after AE, RMI, RMI, VF, AD — matches two RMI followed by VF.

Perfect.

Now, in the XOR choice, it's exclusive, so either the direct path or the loop path.

In the loop path, the loop * (RMI, tau) ensures at least one RMI, which is correct, since when the alternative is taken, there is at least one RMI.

In Case 1 and 3, there is RMI, so yes.

Now, what about the silent tau in the loop? In * (RMI, tau), the tau is executed when deciding to loop back, but since it's silent, it doesn't appear in the trace, so the trace for the loop part is just one or more RMI concatenated.

Yes.

After the loop, VF and then AD.

In the process tree, after the XOR choice, in the second branch, it's sequence of * (RMI, tau) and then VF and then AD.

But AD is common to both branches, so to avoid repetition, in process trees, I should have the XOR before the common part.

In the sequence, after the XOR, it should go to AD only if it's part of the flow.

Let's structure it properly.

The full subtree after AE should be: X ( -> AD, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF, -> AD ) )

But this has AD in both branches, which is redundant, but in process trees, it's okay, as the XOR will choose one path, and AD is executed in both cases.

To make it cleaner, I could have X ( nothing, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) ) then -> AD, but "nothing" isn't directly representable; I might need a silent step or an empty tree, but probably better to keep AD in both.

In process trees, I can have a leaf with tau for silent step.

For the direct choice, I can have a tau or just a direct connection, but since it's a choice to do nothing or do something.

In the XOR operator, if one child is a simple leaf or something.

For the direct path, I can have a process tree that is just a tau or an empty, but perhaps better to have a sequence with no children or something, but I think having -> AD in both is fine.

I can have after AE, X ( path1, path2 ), where path1 is -> AD, and path2 is -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF, -> AD )

Yes.

Now, before that, the beginning: RA  VF  AE

Then after that, the XOR part, then AD  SC  AC

AD, SC, AC are always in sequence after the variable part.

So the full process tree should have:

Sequence of: RA, VF, AE, then the XOR part, then AD, SC, AC.

But the XOR part already includes AD in both branches, so if I put another AD after, it would be wrong.

Mistake.

In my earlier XOR, I have X ( -> AD, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF, -> AD ) ), so AD is part of the XOR subtree.

But then after this XOR, I cannot put another sequence, because AD is already included.

So perhaps the XOR should not include AD.

Better to have the XOR decide what to do before AD.

So after AE, X ( -> AD, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) )

Then after this XOR, -> AD, but no: after the XOR, it should go to AD only once.

In process trees, the XOR operator means that exactly one of the children is executed.

So if I have after AE, X ( child1, child2 ), where child1 is a process tree that does nothing or goes directly to AD, but AD is after.

Perhaps: after AE, X ( tau (silent), -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) )

Then after this XOR, -> AD  SC  AC

Let's see the traces.

For child1: tau (silent), so when chosen, it executes silent step, which doesn't appear.

For child2: sequence of * (RMI, tau) and VF.

* (RMI, tau) as before, one or more RMI.

Then VF.

So if XOR chooses child1: silent, then after XOR, AD, etc. So trace after AE: silent AD... but silent doesn't show, so directly AD.

If XOR chooses child2: execute * (RMI, tau) (one or more RMI), then VF, then after XOR, AD, etc.

So trace: RMI+ VF AD...

But in the case when child2 is chosen, after VF, it goes to AD, which is correct.

And when child1 is chosen, directly to AD.

Perfect.

And the silent tau in child1 doesn't produce any event.

In child2, the * (RMI, tau) has a silent tau, but as discussed, it allows the repetition.

In * (RMI, tau), the traces include RMI, and possibly multiple RMI with silent steps, but since silent, the activity trace is just consecutive RMI if looped.

Yes.

Now, for the loop not to require at least one RMI in the sense that when no loop, we choose child1.

In child2, * (RMI, tau) always executes at least one RMI, which is correct for when the alternative is taken.

Is there a case where there is VF without RMI? No, in the log, when VF is repeated, it's after RMI.

In Case 2, no second VF.

In the XOR, when we choose child2, we always have at least one RMI and then VF.

What if there is a case with multiple RMI but no VF? But in the log, always VF after RMI.

In Case 3, two RMI and then VF.

Now, about the parallel part: in the initial example, there was parallel, but in this log, all activities seem sequential within a case, based on timestamps.

For example, in Case 1, timestamps are sequential: RA at 08:00, VF 08:30, AE 09:00, RMI 09:20, VF 10:00, AD 10:30, etc. No overlapping, so probably no parallelism needed.

Similarly for other cases.

So I can stick with sequence and choice and loop.

Now, the full structure:

Start with sequence: RA, VF, AE, then the XOR part, then AD, SC, AC.

The XOR part is X ( tau, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) )

More precisely, the XOR has two children: one is a leaf tau (silent step), and the other is a sequence: * (RMI, tau), and VF.

In process tree terms, the child should be a process tree.

So, define:

Let xor_node = ProcessTree with operator XOR, and two children:

- child1: a leaf with label "tau" (silent step)

- child2: a sequence node with operator SEQUENCE, and two children: loop_node and VF_node

VF_node is a leaf with label "VF"

loop_node is a loop node with operator LOOP, and two children: A and B.

For loop_node * (A, B), A should be RMI, B should be tau (silent).

In * (RMI, tau): execute RMI, then either exit or execute tau and back to RMI.

Since tau is silent, the effect is that after RMI, you can choose to exit or loop back silently and execute RMI again.

So the possible traces for loop_node: RMI (if exit after first), or RMI (silent) RMI, or RMI (silent) RMI (silent) RMI, etc. So in activity traces, one or more RMI consecutively.

Yes.

Then in the sequence of loop_node and VF, so first the loop (one or more RMI), then VF.

Perfect.

And for the XOR, choosing between silent (do nothing) or the sequence (RMI+ VF).

Then after XOR, sequence to AD, SC, AC.

Now, all are leaves except the operators.

Also, need to make sure the parent pointers are set, but since I'm just describing the structure, I don't need to write code.

Now, to write it in the process tree notation.

The root should be a sequence operator, with children: RA, VF, AE, xor_node, AD, SC, AC.

But xor_node is itself a tree.

In the sequence, the children are the subtrees in order.

So root: operator SEQUENCE, children: [PT_RA, PT_VF, PT_AE, PT_XOR, PT_AD, PT_SC, PT_AC]

Where PT_RA is leaf with label "RA", similarly for others.

PT_XOR is a process tree with operator XOR, parent set to root, and children: [PT_tau1, PT_seq_loop_VF]

PT_tau1 is a leaf with label "tau"

PT_seq_loop_VF is a process tree with operator SEQUENCE, parent set to PT_XOR, and children: [PT_loop_RMI, PT_VF2]

PT_VF2 is a leaf with label "VF"

PT_loop_RMI is a process tree with operator LOOP, parent set to PT_seq_loop_VF, and children: [PT_RMI, PT_tau2]

PT_RMI is a leaf with label "RMI"

PT_tau2 is a leaf with label "tau"

In the loop * (A, B), A and B are subtrees, so PT_RMI and PT_tau2 are leaves.

Now, about the labels: in the event log, activities are like "Receive Application (RA)", but in the process tree, we can use the shorthand like "RA", as in the example.

Similarly for others.

In the loop, we have two tau nodes: one for the XOR choice (silent, meaning no action), and one for the loop back (silent decision).

That's fine.

Now, does this capture all traces?

For Case 2: after AE, XOR chooses the tau path (silent), then AD, etc. So trace: RA, VF, AE, AD, SC, AC — matches, with only one VF.

For Case 1: after AE, XOR chooses the other path, then in the sequence, loop * (RMI, tau): suppose it executes RMI and exits (since only one RMI), then VF, then AD, etc. Trace: RA, VF, AE, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC — good.

For Case 3: in the loop, it can execute RMI, then choose to loop back (via tau), execute RMI again, then exit, then VF, etc. Trace: RA, VF, AE, RMI, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC — good.

Also, the loop allows more RMI if needed, but in the log, up to two, but the model allows more, which is fine for generalization.

Now, about fitness, precision, simplicity: this model fits all traces in the log.

Precision: it doesn't allow invalid traces, like having VF without RMI in the loop part, or multiple VF without the choice.

For example, it doesn't allow a trace with AE  VF  AD without the XOR choice, but in this model, VF after AE only if the XOR chooses the loop path, which includes RMI first.

In the loop path, it's RMI then VF, so VF is always after RMI in that case.

Also, it doesn't allow RMI without being followed by VF in that context.

After the XOR and the potential loop and VF, it goes directly to AD, no other choices.

Simplicity: it uses sequence, XOR, and loop operators, which is reasonable.

No unnecessary parallel or other operators.

In the beginning, RA, VF, AE are always in sequence.

Then the variable part.

Finally, AD, SC, AC in sequence.

In the event log, AC is always last, but in the model, it's fine.

Now, to write the process tree in a descriptive way.

Since the task is to produce the final process tree model in a structural description, perhaps similar to the example.

In the example, it was given as a string like `+ ( 'A', -> ( 'B', 'C' ) )`, but with the operators defined.

So I can write it in a nested way.

Root is -> ( RA, VF, AE, X ( tau, -> ( * ( RMI, tau ), VF ) ), AD, SC, AC )

But the sequence operator is ->, but it can have multiple children.

In the prompt, -> (A, B) is for two, but probably it can be extended to more.

In the process tree object, children is a list, so it can have multiple.

In the notation, perhaps write it as a tree.

I can define it step by step.

But perhaps in a compact string.

Since it's a bit nested, I can describe it.

But for the answer, I should write it in a similar fashion.

Let me try:

The root is a sequence operator -> with children: 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', an XOR operator X with children: tau, and a sequence operator -> with children: a loop operator * with children: 'RMI', tau, and 'VF', then 'AD', 'SC', 'AC'.

More carefully:

Root: operator SEQUENCE, children:

1. Leaf: label "RA"

2. Leaf: label "VF"

3. Leaf: label "AE"

4. XOR node: operator XOR, children:

a. Leaf: label "tau"

b. Sequence node: operator SEQUENCE, children:

i. Loop node: operator LOOP, children:

- Leaf: label "RMI"

- Leaf: label "tau"

ii. Leaf: label "VF"

5. Leaf: label "AD"

6. Leaf: label "SC"

7. Leaf: label "AC"

In the sequence after XOR, it's directly AD, etc.

In my earlier thought, after the XOR node, in the root sequence, we have the XOR, then AD, SC, AC.

And the XOR handles the part before AD.

Now, about the labels: in the event log, activities are given with full names, but in the process tree, we can use the abbreviations as in the table, like "RA", "VF", etc.

I think it's fine.

To make it clear, I can use the full names, but abbreviations are okay.

In the loop, the second tau is for the loop back, and the first tau is for the silent choice.

This should work.

Is there a way to make it simpler? For example, without the silent steps, but I think silent steps are necessary to model the optional part and the loop decision.

In some process discovery algorithms, they might produce different models, but this seems to capture the behavior accurately.

About the repeating RMI: in the loop * (RMI, tau), it allows RMI to be repeated, with the decision after each RMI.

In the log, the decision might be after a series, but the model allows it, and it's fine.

I think this is a good model.

So, to box the answer, I need to present the process tree structure.
</think>

The process tree model for the given event log is designed to capture the main sequential flow of activities, the optional loop for handling missing information (with possible repetitions of "Request Missing Info" and a subsequent "Validate Form"), and the final sequence leading to case closure. The model ensures high fitness by covering all observed traces, good precision by not allowing invalid sequences, and simplicity by using only sequence, XOR choice, and loop operators without unnecessary complexity.

Here is the process tree structure in a hierarchical notation, using the defined operators and activity labels (abbreviations as used in the event log for brevity):

- Root: Operator `->` (SEQUENCE), with children:
  - `'RA'` (leaf node, activity "Receive Application")
  - `'VF'` (leaf node, activity "Validate Form" – initial validation)
  - `'AE'` (leaf node, activity "Assess Eligibility")
  - XOR node: Operator `X` (XOR), with children:
    - `tau` (leaf node, silent step – represents the choice to skip the loop)
    - Sequence node: Operator `->` (SEQUENCE), with children:
      - Loop node: Operator `*` (LOOP), with children:
        - `'RMI'` (leaf node, activity "Request Missing Info" – the part that can repeat)
        - `tau` (leaf node, silent step – represents the loop decision point)
      - `'VF'` (leaf node, activity "Validate Form" – re-validation after missing info handling)
  - `'AD'` (leaf node, activity "Approval Decision")
  - `'SC'` (leaf node, activity "Send Confirmation")
  - `'AC'` (leaf node, activity "Archive Case")

### Explanation of the Structure:
- The root sequence ensures that the process always starts with "Receive Application", followed by the initial "Validate Form" and "Assess Eligibility".
- After "Assess Eligibility", an exclusive choice (XOR) is made:
  - If no missing information is needed (as in Case 2), the silent step (`tau`) is taken, and the process proceeds directly to "Approval Decision".
  - If missing information is detected (as in Cases 1 and 3), the alternative path is taken, which includes a loop.
- The loop (`*`) allows "Request Missing Info" to be executed one or more times (handled by the loop operator with a silent step for the decision to repeat). After the loop exits, "Validate Form" is re-executed to confirm the information.
- Following the XOR choice, the process continues with "Approval Decision", "Send Confirmation", and "Archive Case" in strict sequence.
- Silent steps (`tau`) are used to model decisions without visible activities, ensuring the model accurately represents the optional and repetitive behavior without adding extra visible events.

This process tree generates all traces observed in the event log:
- Case 2: `RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC` (XOR chooses the silent path, no loop).
- Case 1: `RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC` (XOR chooses the loop path with one RMI iteration).
- Case 3: `RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC` (XOR chooses the loop path with multiple RMI iterations).

The model is concise, fitting the log perfectly while allowing for generalization (e.g., more RMI repetitions if they occur in unseen cases). No parallel operator is needed, as all activities appear sequential based on the timestamps.
