# Optimizing E-Commerce Order Fulfillment with Constraint-Aware Process Mining

---

## **1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**

To address the fulfillment center's operational challenges, we begin by applying **process mining techniques** to the event log. The log contains multi-instance dependencies, requiring advanced discovery and conformance checking methods.

### **A. Shared Cold-Packing Stations**

**Identification:**
- Use **resource-based process discovery** to map which activities (e.g., Packing) are associated with which resources.
- Group events by `Resource ID` (e.g., C1-C5 for cold stations), filter for `Cold Packing = TRUE`.
- Analyze **resource utilization metrics** (e.g., % time occupied, average queue length) and **waiting time distributions**.

**Impact Metrics:**
- **Average waiting time for cold-packing stations**
- **Throughput of cold-packing orders**
- **Utilization of cold-packing stations**
- **Number of orders delayed due to cold-packing unavailability**

**Differentiating Waiting Types:**
- Use **start and complete timestamps** to compute activity duration vs. time between complete and next activity start.
- If an order completes "Item Picking" at 10:15 and starts "Packing" at 10:20, the 5-minute gap is **inter-instance waiting** (resource contention).

---

### **B. Shipping Batching**

**Identification:**
- Group orders by `Destination Region` and `Shipping Label Generation` timestamps.
- Identify **batch formation patterns** and **batch completion delays**.
- Use **bottleneck analysis** to detect how long orders wait for their batch to complete.

**Impact Metrics:**
- **Average batch waiting time**
- **Batch size distribution**
- **Order delay due to batching (time between order completion and batch release)**
- **Batch completion rate**

**Differentiating Waiting Types:**
- Orders that complete all steps but are not released until others are ready are **batch-induced waits**.

---

### **C. Priority Handling (Express Orders)**

**Identification:**
- Filter for `Order Type = Express` and look for **interruptions** in standard order processing.
- Identify when a standard order was paused (e.g., "Packing" activity started, then later resumed).

**Impact Metrics:**
- **Number of interruptions per standard order**
- **Average interruption duration**
- **Throughput of standard vs. express orders**
- **Resource switching overhead** (time lost due to context switching)

**Differentiating Waiting Types:**
- Time between "Packing" complete and next activity start due to an express order preempting the resource is **priority-induced waiting**.

---

### **D. Hazardous Material Limits**

**Identification:**
- Count concurrent `Hazardous Material = TRUE` orders in "Packing" or "Quality Check".
- Use **conformance checking** to detect violations of the "max 10 concurrent" rule.
- Identify **throttling points** where orders are held due to regulatory limits.

**Impact Metrics:**
- **Number of orders delayed due to hazardous limits**
- **Average delay duration**
- **Throughput during hazardous material bottlenecks**
- **Number of regulatory violations (if any)**

**Differentiating Waiting Types:**
- Orders that complete Item Picking but are not assigned to Packing until hazardous capacity is available experience **regulatory-induced waiting**.

---

## **2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions**

Understanding **constraint interactions** is critical because these dependencies compound and create nonlinear delays.

### **A. Express Orders and Cold-Packing Stations**
- Express orders may preempt standard orders at cold-packing stations, increasing queue length and waiting times for standard orders.
- Cold-packing becomes a **priority bottleneck**, potentially causing **starvation** of non-express orders.

### **B. Batching and Hazardous Orders**
- If multiple hazardous orders are bound for the same region, they may be **batched together**, but only up to 10 can be processed concurrently.
- This creates **batching constraints** that interact with **regulatory limits**, potentially **stalling batch formation**.

### **C. Resource Contention and Priority Rules**
- Express orders may cause **frequent resource switching**, reducing packing station efficiency.
- This **increases idle time** due to setup or preparation, lowering **overall throughput**.

### **D. Importance of Interaction Analysis**
- Optimization strategies must consider **joint effects**, not isolated constraints.
- For example, increasing cold-packing capacity may not help if priority handling creates constant resource switching.
- A **holistic view** allows **targeted interventions** that reduce cascading delays.

## **3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation with Priority-Aware Scheduling**

**Constraint Addressed:**  
- Shared Cold-Packing Stations  
- Priority Handling

**Proposed Changes:**
- Implement a **real-time scheduling engine** that:
  - Assigns cold-packing stations based on:
    - Order type (Express > Standard)
    - Estimated processing time
    - Current queue load
    - Predicted batch formation needs

**Data Leverage:**
- Use historical data to **predict order arrival rates** and **processing durations**.
- Apply **machine learning models** to forecast cold-packing demand and schedule accordingly.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Reduced **waiting time** for both express and standard orders.
- Improved **resource utilization** without overloading cold-packing stations.
- **Balanced throughput** between express and standard orders.

---

### **Strategy 2: Smart Batching with Dynamic Trigger Conditions**

**Constraint Addressed:**  
- Shipping Batching  
- Hazardous Material Limits

**Proposed Changes:**
- Replace fixed batch sizes with **dynamic batching logic** that:
  - Batches orders when:
    - A minimum number of orders is reached
    - A time window has elapsed
    - Hazardous material count in the batch is under the regulatory limit
  - Prioritize **non-hazardous orders** to avoid holding up hazardous ones.

**Data Leverage:**
- Analyze **historical batch performance** to determine optimal trigger conditions.
- Use **clustering techniques** to group orders by destination and hazard status.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Reduced **batch waiting time**
- Fewer **violations** of hazardous material limits
- **Improved delivery efficiency** through optimized route planning

---

### **Strategy 3: Constraint-Aware Order Release Policy**

**Constraint Addressed:**  
- Hazardous Material Limits  
- Priority Handling  
- Shared Resources

**Proposed Changes:**
- Implement a **centralized order release system** that:
  - Only allows orders to enter "Packing" or "Quality Check" if:
    - Cold-packing station is available (if required)
    - Hazardous material count is under 10
    - No higher-priority order is waiting
- Use **real-time dashboards** to monitor:
  - Current hazardous order count
  - Cold-packing queue length
  - Express order backlog

**Data Leverage:**
- Use **process mining dashboards** to monitor real-time constraint status.
- Apply **predictive analytics** to anticipate upcoming resource needs.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **Prevents violations** of hazardous material limits
- **Balances resource contention** between order types
- **Reduces idle time** and unnecessary task switching

---

## **4. Simulation and Validation**

Before implementation, **simulation models** can test the proposed strategies under various scenarios.

### **Modeling Approach:**
- Use **discrete-event simulation (DES)** tools (e.g., Simul8, AnyLogic).
- Model:
  - Resource pools (cold vs. standard packing stations)
  - Batching logic
  - Priority rules
  - Hazardous material constraints

### **Validation Focus Areas:**
- **Resource contention**: Measure queue lengths and utilization under load.
- **Batching delays**: Evaluate average wait time for batch completion.
- **Priority handling**: Assess delay introduced to standard orders.
- **Regulatory limits**: Monitor throughput and compliance during peak hazardous order periods.

### **Metrics to Track in Simulation:**
- **End-to-end order cycle time**
- **Throughput (orders per hour)**
- **Resource utilization**
- **Constraint violation count**
- **Average waiting time per constraint type**

### **Outcome:**
- Validate whether proposed strategies **reduce delays** and **increase throughput** while **respecting constraints**.
- Identify **unexpected bottlenecks** or **interactions** before deployment.
