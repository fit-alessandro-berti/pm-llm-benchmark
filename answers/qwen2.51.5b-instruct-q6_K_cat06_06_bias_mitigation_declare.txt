**Rationale:**
1. **Coexistence Constraint for `FinalDecision`:** Ensures that a `ManualReview` activity always coexists with a decision step involving sensitive attributes (e.g., "Reject" after checking an `ApplicantRace`). This prevents biased outcomes where the absence of relevant information might lead to discriminatory decisions.
2. **Response Constraints:** For each response type (`Approve`, `Reject`), if they are preceded by an activity that discloses sensitive attributes (e.g., `CheckApplicantGender`), a bias mitigation check must occur before proceeding to ensure fairness in decision-making.
3. **Succession Constraint for `FinalDecision`:** Similarly, ensures the absence of relevant information (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) does not lead directly to biased outcomes without a proper bias mitigation step.

These constraints help mitigate potential biases by ensuring that sensitive information is always accompanied by appropriate checks before decisions are made, thereby maintaining fairness and reducing discrimination in loan application processes.
