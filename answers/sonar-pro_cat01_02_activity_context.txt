Justification for naming choices:

1. "Initiate Request" was renamed to reflect the channel: "Submit Online Request" for web portal submissions and "Submit In-Person Request" for branch walk-ins.

2. "Verify Documents" was split into "Initial Document Verification" and "Final Document Verification" or "Re-verify Documents" to distinguish between first and subsequent checks.

3. "Call Customer" was renamed based on the purpose of the call: "Request Missing Documents," "Clarify Account Discrepancy," "Confirm Account Adjustments," and "Request Customer Return."

4. "Submit Additional" was renamed to "Upload Additional Documents" to clarify the action taken by the customer.

These changes provide more context about each activity's role in the process, making the workflow easier to understand and analyze.
