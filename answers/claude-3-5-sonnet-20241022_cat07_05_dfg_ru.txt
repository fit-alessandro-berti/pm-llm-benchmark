This visualization appears to be a state diagram or workflow diagram representing some kind of request processing system. The diagram starts with an initial state (black dot) and flows through several processes:

1. It begins with "register request" (6)
2. Moves to "check ticket" (9)
3. Then branches to several possible paths including:
   - "decide" (9) which can lead to:
     * "reject request" (3)
     * "pay compensation" (3)
     * "reinitiate request" (3)
   - "examine thoroughly" (3)
   - "examine casually" (6)

The numbers in parentheses appear to indicate weights or processing times. The diagram uses arrows to show the flow between different states, with some paths having numbered weights on the connecting lines. The boxes are colored in purple/blue for main processes and white for outcome processes. The diagram ends with a final state indicated by a double circle.

This could represent a customer service or claims processing workflow, where requests are evaluated through different examination paths before reaching a final decision.
