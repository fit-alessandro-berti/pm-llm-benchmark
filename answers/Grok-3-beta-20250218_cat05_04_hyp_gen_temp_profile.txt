Analysis of Temporal Profile Model Anomalies
Based on the temporal profile model provided, the following anomalies stand out due to unusual average times or standard deviations:
R to P (Receive to Approve): 25 hours avg, 1 hour STDEV
The average time of ~25 hours seems reasonable, but the extremely low standard deviation (1 hour) suggests an unnaturally rigid process. Approvals typically vary based on claim complexity, yet this consistency is suspicious.
P to N (Approve to Notify): 7 days avg, 2 days STDEV
A 7-day average delay is unusually long for notifying a customer after approval, and the high standard deviation (2 days) indicates inconsistency—some notifications happen much faster, others much slower.
A to C (Assign to Close): 2 hours avg, 1 hour STDEV
Closing a claim just 2 hours after assignment, on average, is surprisingly quick. This could imply that some claims skip critical steps like evaluation or approval, especially with a moderate standard deviation.
E to N (Evaluate to Notify): 5 minutes avg, 1 minute STDEV
An average of 5 minutes is exceptionally short for transitioning from evaluation to notification, and the low standard deviation suggests this is consistent. This rapid turnaround might indicate automation or skipping of necessary reviews.
Hypotheses on Anomalies
R to P (Receive to Approve) – Low STDEV
Hypothesis: Approvals might be automated or scheduled artificially (e.g., batch processing at fixed intervals), ignoring claim-specific factors like complexity or adjuster workload.
Reason: A rigid system design or policy could enforce approvals within a narrow time frame, suppressing natural variability.
P to N (Approve to Notify) – Long Delay, High STDEV
Hypothesis: There could be a bottleneck in the notification process, possibly due to limited staff availability or delays in communication channels (e.g., manual mail vs. email).
Reason: Inconsistent resource allocation or reliance on external systems might cause erratic timing.
A to C (Assign to Close) – Short Time
Hypothesis: Some claims might be closed prematurely without proper evaluation, perhaps due to adjuster errors, system glitches, or a policy to fast-track low-value claims.
Reason: Lack of oversight or an incentive to clear backlogs could bypass intended steps.
E to N (Evaluate to Notify) – Very Short Time
Hypothesis: This could reflect an automated notification system triggered immediately after evaluation, potentially skipping human review or customer acknowledgment steps.
Reason: Over-automation or misconfigured workflows might eliminate necessary delays for quality control.
Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries
Below are SQL queries to investigate these anomalies using the claim_events table, with potential correlations to claims and adjusters.
1. R to P (Receive to Approve) – Investigate Low Variability
sql
WITH rp_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    rt.time_diff_seconds
FROM rp_times rt
JOIN claims c ON rt.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = CAST(ce.resource AS INTEGER)
WHERE rt.time_diff_seconds < 90000 - 2 * 3600  -- Below avg - 2 * STDEV
   OR rt.time_diff_seconds > 90000 + 2 * 3600  -- Above avg + 2 * STDEV;
Purpose: Identify claims where the R-to-P time deviates significantly from the average (outside 2 standard deviations). Check if specific claim types or adjusters correlate with this rigidity.
2. P to N (Approve to Notify) – Investigate Long Delays
sql
WITH pn_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    a.region,
    pn.time_diff_seconds
FROM pn_times pn
JOIN claims c ON pn.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = CAST(ce.resource AS INTEGER)
WHERE pn.time_diff_seconds > 604800 + 2 * 172800  -- Above avg + 2 * STDEV
ORDER BY pn.time_diff_seconds DESC;
Purpose: Find claims with excessively long P-to-N delays (beyond 9 days). Correlate with region or claim type to detect bottlenecks or resource issues.
3. A to C (Assign to Close) – Check Premature Closures
sql
WITH ac_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ce3.activity IN ('E', 'P') THEN 1 END) AS intermediate_steps
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    LEFT JOIN claim_events ce3 ON ce1.claim_id = ce3.claim_id 
        AND ce3.timestamp > ce1.timestamp 
        AND ce3.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
    GROUP BY ce1.claim_id, ce2.timestamp, ce1.timestamp
)
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    ac.time_diff_seconds,
    ac.intermediate_steps
FROM ac_times ac
JOIN claims c ON ac.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = CAST(ce.resource AS INTEGER)
WHERE ac.time_diff_seconds < 7200  -- Below average
  AND ac.intermediate_steps < 2;   -- Missing E or P steps
Purpose: Identify claims closed quickly after assignment with missing intermediate steps (E or P). Check adjuster patterns or claim amounts for premature closure trends.
4. E to N (Evaluate to Notify) – Investigate Rapid Transitions
sql
WITH en_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    ce1.resource AS evaluator,
    en.time_diff_seconds
FROM en_times en
JOIN claims c ON en.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce1 ON en.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'E'
WHERE en.time_diff_seconds < 300 - 2 * 60  -- Below avg - 2 * STDEV;
Purpose: Find claims with E-to-N times under 3 minutes (beyond 2 standard deviations). Examine resources involved to detect automation or skipped checks.
Conclusion
These queries help pinpoint specific claims exhibiting the identified anomalies, allowing further investigation into systemic issues, adjuster behavior, or process design flaws. Correlation with claim types, regions, or resources can reveal underlying causes like automation errors, staffing shortages, or policy inconsistencies.
