Certainly! Below is a list of 20 relevant questions and their corresponding confidence scores based on the provided data.

### Questions:

   - Confidence Score: High (7 out of 10 frequency)

2. **From which entity's approval can a 'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER' originate?**
   - Confidence Score: Moderate-High (5/8 performance from both ADMINISTRATION and SUPERVISOR to Budget Owner for DECLARATION)

3. **What's the most common reason a declaration request is not approved?**
   - Confidence Score: Very High (Reasons include Rejected by EMPLOYEE, missing documentation, etc.)

4. **In what frequency does payment handling occur after submission?**
   - Confidence Score: Medium-High (Multiple 'Payment Handled' instances showing different frequencies)

5. **How often are declarations rejected?**
   - Confidence Score: High (10/8 performance from ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER, with occasional DECLARATION REJECTED by EMPLOYEE or SUPERVISOR)

6. **During which step is approval typically rejected?**
   - Confidence Score: Moderately-High (Reasons include Rejected by SUPERVISOR or EMPLOYEE for different reasons)

7. **What's the most common reason a declaration request is denied at various levels of approval (e.g., from BUDGET OWNER to SUPERVISOR)?**
   - Confidence Score: High (Common reasons among multiple instances, indicating issues with process flow between budget owners and supervisors)

8. **How often does a 'Request Payment' occur after the final review?**
   - Confidence Score: Medium-High (Multiple times showing different frequencies)

9. **What is the frequency of declaration submission from an individual employee to the next level or team?**
   - Confidence Score: High (Frequency varies ranging from 5 to 10 submissions per request across declarations)

10. **On what type of documentation does a declaration typically rely to move through the approval process?**
    - Confidence Score: Strongly-High (Depends on reason but usually includes budget owner’s signature, etc.)

11. **How consistent is the payment request handling throughout each instance of handling payments after declarations?**
   - Confidence Score: Low-Medium (Shows a range in execution time)

12. **In which frequency can 'Final Approval' occur before or after multiple approvals are given at various levels?**
    - Confidence Score: High (Variates between 6-8 times with the final approval phase)

13. **What is the most common sequence for declaration processing from submission to review completion?**
    - Confidence Score: High (Showing sequences repeated in different forms among declarations)

14. **How often does a specific reason contribute to multiple REJECTED reasons within an instance of declaration processing?**
    - Confidence Score: Very-Low-Medium (Varies but shows common patterns across types)

15. **What percentage change is there from the last declaration submission frequency to this week's?**
   - Confidence Score: Low-Moderate (Notably higher in this last data point compared to previous weeks or months)

16. **Considering that each approval level can vary in time duration, what average time does it take from a declaration's first step until final review?**
    - Confidence Score: High-Medium (Shows variation but averages across declared states and approvals)

17. **In what frequency are multiple 'Rejection' reasons seen within an instance of the submission process for declarations?**
    - Confidence Score: Intense-Low-High (Variates significantly in how many reasons occur simultaneously depending on individual instances)

18. **What action(s) have taken to mitigate or improve issues encountered during declaration processing at various levels?**
    - Confidence Score: Moderate-Very-Low (Shows ongoing efforts across a few different methods noted)

19. **How consistent is the request for payment handling within each instance of the approval and submission process?**
    - Confidence Score: High-Medium (Varying but consistent trends in handling timeframes when making payments)

20. **What type of validation or review occurs at each level of 'declared states' to ensure timely processing by multiple entities involved in the declaration lifecycle across various instance paths?**
   - Confidence Score: Low-High (Shows a dynamic array of different types validated at numerous levels)

### Key Considerations:
1. Frequency and duration analysis.
2. Common reasons for rejections and associated steps leading up to it.
3. Variability among employees or teams in handling time frames.
4. Impact of varying performance metrics on process consistency.
5. Steps taken by various entities to ensure proper validation or review at critical stages in the declaration lifecycle.

### Proposed Confidence Scores:
- **High** (Very High, Very Low)
- **Moderate** (Lower Medium and Lower)
- **Low** (Upper Low and Lowest)
