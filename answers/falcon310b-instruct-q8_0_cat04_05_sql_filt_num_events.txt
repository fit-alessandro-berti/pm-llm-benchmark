**Sample DuckDB SQL Query:**

```sql
WITH CaseEventCounts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    CaseEventCounts cec ON e.case_id = cec.case_id
WHERE
    cec.event_count <= 6;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **CaseEventCounts CTE (Common Table Expression):** 
   - This subquery calculates the number of events for each `case_id` by grouping the `event_log` table by `case_id` and counting the rows in each group.
   
2. **Main Query:**
   - It joins the original `event_log` table with the `CaseEventCounts` CTE on `case_id`.
   - The `WHERE` clause filters out any rows where the event count (`event_count`) for the `case_id` is greater than 6.
   - Finally, it selects all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` table for the remaining cases that meet the condition of having 6 or fewer events.

This query ensures that only events from cases with 6 or fewer events are returned, effectively filtering out any cases with more than six events.
