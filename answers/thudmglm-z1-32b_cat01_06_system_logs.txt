### Explanation of Logic

#### **Case Identification Logic**
1. **Document-Centric Flow**:  
   Each document (`Document1.docx`, `Quarterly_Report.docx`, `Budget_2024.xlsx`, etc.) represents a **case** if the user interacts with it for a logical task (e.g., drafting, saving, closing). For example:
   - `Document1.docx` (Case 1) includes all interactions with the file, even after interruptions (e.g., switching to Chrome and Excel).  
   - The final `Quarterly_Report.docx` session (Case 5) is treated as a separate case from the initial focus (no activity) because it starts with new work (creating an executive summary).

2. **Task-Based Grouping**:  
   Non-document tasks (e.g., replying to an email, reviewing a PDF) are split into their own cases. For example:
   - **Email Reply (Case 2)** includes opening the email, composing, and sending.  
   - **PDF Review (Case 3)** focuses on scrolling and highlighting, marking it as a distinct task.

3. **Exclusion of Idle Focus**:  
   The initial `FOCUS` on `Quarterly_Report.docx` (08:59:50) was omitted as a standalone case because the user immediately switched away and performed no actions.

#### **Activity Naming**
- **Standardization**: Raw system actions (e.g., `TYPING`, `SAVE`) were mapped to process-friendly activities:
  - `TYPING`  `Edit Document` (with optional descriptors like "Draft Intro" for context).  
  - `FOCUS`  `Open Document` (start of engagement).  
  - `HIGHLIGHT`  `Annotate Document` (for PDF review).  
  - `CLICK` (Send)  `Send Email` (end of a task).  

#### **Handling Interruptions**
- **Temporal Ordering**: Events are ordered chronologically, even if they belong to different cases (e.g., the email task interrupts work on `Document1.docx`).  
- **Switching Events**: `SWITCH` actions were excluded as standalone activities but used to infer the end of a case (e.g., switching away from `Document1.docx` after saving).

#### **Example Workflow**
- **Case 1 (Document1.docx)**:  
  User opens the document, drafts content, saves, works on other tasks, returns to refine it with a budget reference, and closes it. This reflects a single task with natural pauses.  
- **Case 5 (Final Quarterly Report)**:  
  Distinct from earlier interactions because the user starts fresh with a new activity (executive summary), making it a separate case for process analysis.

### Process Insights
- **Tool-Friendly Structure**: This log enables tools like Disco or ProM to visualize:  
  - A looping process for `Document1.docx` (editing  saving  revisiting).  
  - Parallel tasks (e.g., working on the budget while reviewing a PDF).  
  - Bottlenecks (e.g., delays in switching between apps).
