**Assumptions and Notes:**
- **Activity Names**: I used "Item Picked" for each order line to capture granular picking events, as they occur at different times with different resources. "Delivery Dispatched" and "Delivery Arrived" are separate events per delivery to reflect the lifecycle. "Invoice Issued" per invoice and "Payment Received" per payment.
- **Resource/Actor**: Derived from the Resources table, combining name and role. For payments, no direct resource is available, so marked as "N/A".
- **Other Attributes**: Included relevant details as comma-separated key-value pairs for context.
- **Chronological Order**: Events are listed sorted by Case ID and then by Timestamp within each case.
- **Missing Data**: Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment data, so only creation and picking events are included. For order 1002, the two "Delivery Arrived" events have timestamps that are close; they are ordered chronologically. All available data is included; no fabrication of missing events.
