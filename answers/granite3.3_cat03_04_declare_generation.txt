This `declare_model` dictionary encapsulates various DECLARE constraints relevant to the multi-step product design and launch process within a manufacturing company, including existence, initial activities, responses, predecessor-successor relationships, and potential alternative flows or conditions. It provides a structured framework for analyzing and enforcing process compliance or identifying deviations and opportunities for improvement.
