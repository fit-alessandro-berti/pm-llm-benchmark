 In multi-dimensional process mining, process cubes play a significant role as they allow for a more granular and comprehensive analysis of business processes by considering various dimensions or attributes. These attributes can include the time aspect, resources involved, data artifacts, and other factors that can influence the execution of a process.

Traditional process mining approaches often focus on the flow and sequence of activities in a process without delving deeply into these additional dimensions. The main goal is to reconstruct the actual process model from event logs (sequences of process-related events), and to analyze the deviations from the ideal or reference models.

On the other hand, multi-dimensional process mining goes beyond this by exploring different aspects of processes in more detail. Process cubes are a key tool for achieving this goal. A process cube is an extension of the process model with additional dimensions, enabling:

1. Detailed analysis of each process instance (instead of just looking at overall process behavior)
2. Comparison and visualization of process instances from multiple perspectives (e.g., resource-centric or time-centric views)
3. Identification of patterns or trends that may be missed in traditional approaches due to their focus on high-level flow and sequencing of activities
4. Improved insights for business analysts, helping them understand the process behavior at a more granular level, which can ultimately lead to better decision-making and process optimization.

In summary, while traditional process mining focuses on process flow and sequence, multi-dimensional process mining with process cubes provides a more detailed analysis of processes by considering various dimensions or attributes, offering valuable insights into the execution of business processes.
