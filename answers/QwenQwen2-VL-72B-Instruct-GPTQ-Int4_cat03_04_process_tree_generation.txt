Certainly! Below is the Python code to create a process tree for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using the pm4py library:
```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Purchase-to-Pay process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Parallel block 1
parallel1 = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
A = ProcessTree(label="Create Purchase Order", parent=parallel1)
B = ProcessTree(label="Check Supplier", parent=parallel1)
parallel1.children.append(A)
parallel1.children.append(B)
root.children.append(parallel1)

# Parallel block 2
parallel2 = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
C = ProcessTree(label="Check Inventory", parent=parallel2)
D = ProcessTree(label="Order from Supplier", parent=parallel2)
parallel2.children.append(C)
parallel2.children.append(D)
root.children.append(parallel2)

# Sequence block
seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
E = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=seq)
F = ProcessTree(label="Create Invoice", parent=seq)
seq.children.append(E)
seq.children.append(F)
root.children.append(seq)

# Parallel block 3
parallel3 = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
G = ProcessTree(label="Approve Invoice", parent=parallel3)
H = ProcessTree(label="Pay Invoice", parent=parallel3)
parallel3.children.append(G)
parallel3.children.append(H)
root.children.append(parallel3)
```
In this example, the Purchase-to-Pay process tree consists of four main blocks:

1. Parallel block 1: Create Purchase Order and Check Supplier
2. Parallel block 2: Check Inventory and Order from Supplier
3. Sequence block: Receive Goods and Create Invoice
4. Parallel block 3: Approve Invoice and Pay Invoice

These blocks are organized in a parallel structure, which means they can be executed concurrently. The sequence block has its own children in a specific order.
