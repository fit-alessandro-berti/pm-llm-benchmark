Let's analyze each case in the event log against the normative process description to identify violations.

---

### **Case 1**
**Sequence:**
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

**Analysis:**
This sequence strictly follows the normative process for sufficient inventory:
1. Receive order  Check inventory (correct)
2. Check inventory  Authorize payment (correct, inventory sufficiency is confirmed)
3. Authorize payment  Package items (correct)
4. Package items  Ship order (correct)
5. Ship order  Close order (correct)

**Conclusion:** **No violations.**

---

### **Case 2**
**Sequence:**
Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Analysis:**
This sequence violates the normative process in the following ways:
1. **Check inventory  Package items:** The normative process states that "Authorize payment" must occur **after** "Check inventory" and **before** "Package items." Here, "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment," which is incorrect. Packaging should only happen after payment is authorized (since payment authorization implies inventory sufficiency is already confirmed).
2. **Authorize payment  Ship order:** While this step is technically correct (payment is authorized before shipping), the earlier violation (packaging before authorization) makes this sequence invalid. The normative process requires that "Package items" must occur **after** "Authorize payment" and **before** "Ship order."

**Conclusion:** **Violates the normative process.** The key violation is **packaging items before payment authorization**, which is illogical because payment authorization should only occur after inventory is confirmed sufficient.

---

### **Case 3**
**Sequence:**
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

**Analysis:**
This sequence violates the normative process in the following ways:
1. **Authorize payment  Cancel order:** The normative process states that if inventory is insufficient, the process should branch to "Cancel order" **immediately after** "Check inventory," without proceeding to "Authorize payment." Authorizing payment after checking inventory (and presumably finding insufficient stock) is illogical because payment authorization assumes inventory sufficiency.
2. **Cancel order  Ship order:** The normative process explicitly states that "Ship order" should **never** occur after a cancellation. Shipping is only appropriate for fulfilled orders, not canceled ones.

**Conclusion:** **Violates the normative process.** The key violations are:
   - **Authorizing payment after inventory is insufficient** (contradicts the cancellation branch).
   - **Shipping after cancellation** (illogical and explicitly prohibited).

---

### **Case 4**
**Sequence:**
Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

**Analysis:**
This sequence follows the normative process for insufficient inventory:
1. Receive order  Check inventory (correct)
2. Check inventory  Cancel order (correct, inventory is insufficient)
3. Cancel order  Close order (correct, no further fulfillment steps)

**Conclusion:** **No violations.**

---

### **Case 5**
**Sequence:**
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Analysis:**
This sequence violates the normative process in the following ways:
1. **Authorize payment  Ship order:** The normative process states that "Ship order" should only occur **after** "Package items." Shipping without packaging is illogical because items must be prepared for shipment before they can be shipped.
2. **Missing "Package items":** The normative process explicitly requires that "Package items" must occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." Skipping this step is a violation.

**Conclusion:** **Violates the normative process.** The key violation is **shipping without packaging**, which is illogical and explicitly prohibited by the normative description.

### **Summary of Violations:**
| Case ID | Violations                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | None                                                                       |
| 2       | Packaged items before payment authorization (violates order: Check  Authorize  Package) |
| 3       | Authorized payment after cancellation (illogical), shipped after cancellation (explicitly prohibited) |
| 4       | None                                                                       |
| 5       | Shipped without packaging (missing "Package items" step)                   |

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Case 2** is the most subtle violation because it appears to follow the general order of activities but skips the critical dependency that "Authorize payment" must precede "Package items."
2. **Case 3** is the most egregious because it violates two core principles: (a) it authorizes payment after cancellation (which is impossible in reality) and (b) it ships after cancellation (which is explicitly prohibited).
3. **Case 5** is a common oversight where the "Package items" step is omitted, leading to an incomplete or incorrect sequence.

### **Interpretation of Ambiguities:**
- The normative process does not explicitly state whether "Authorize payment" can occur before "Check inventory," but the description implies that inventory sufficiency is a prerequisite for payment authorization. Thus, **Case 2's sequence is invalid** because it assumes payment authorization can happen before packaging, which is impossible without confirming inventory first.
- The normative process does not explicitly allow "Cancel order" to occur before "Check inventory," but the description implies that inventory checking is a prerequisite for cancellation. However, **Case 3's sequence is still invalid** because it authorizes payment after cancellation, which is illogical and violates the principle that payment authorization requires inventory sufficiency.
