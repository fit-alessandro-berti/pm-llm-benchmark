## Step 1: Calculate the duration of each case
To identify cases with performance issues, we first need to calculate the duration of each case. This involves finding the difference between the timestamp of the "Close Claim" event and the "Submit Claim" event for each Case ID.

## Step 2: Identify the cases with significantly longer durations
We will calculate the duration for each case and then compare these durations to identify which cases are taking significantly longer.

- For Case ID 2001: $2024-04-01 10:30 - 2024-04-01 09:00 = 1.5$ hours
- For Case ID 2002: $2024-04-02 11:00 - 2024-04-01 09:05 = 25.92$ hours (or approximately 1.08 days)
- For Case ID 2003: $2024-04-03 09:30 - 2024-04-01 09:10 = 48.33$ hours (or approximately 2.01 days)
- For Case ID 2004: $2024-04-01 10:45 - 2024-04-01 09:20 = 1.42$ hours
- For Case ID 2005: $2024-04-04 14:30 - 2024-04-01 09:25 = 77.08$ hours (or approximately 3.21 days)

## Step 3: Analyze the calculated durations to identify cases with performance issues
Comparing the durations: Case ID 2001 = 1.5 hours, Case ID 2002 = 25.92 hours, Case ID 2003 = 48.33 hours, Case ID 2004 = 1.42 hours, Case ID 2005 = 77.08 hours. Cases 2003 and 2005 are significantly longer than the others.

## Step 4: Analyze the attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity) for the cases with performance issues
- Case ID 2003: Region A, Complexity High. Resources involved: CSR_Jane, Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Bill, Finance_Alan.
- Case ID 2005: Region B, Complexity High. Resources involved: CSR_Paul, Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Bill, Finance_Carl.

Both cases have High Complexity and involve multiple requests for additional documents.

## Step 5: Examine the correlation between attributes and case duration
- **Complexity**: Both Case ID 2003 and 2005 have High Complexity and are among the longest. This suggests that High Complexity claims may be associated with longer durations.
- **Region**: Case ID 2003 is in Region A, and Case ID 2005 is in Region B. Both regions have cases with significant durations, but the issue isn't exclusive to one region.
- **Resource**: Adjuster_Mike (Region A) and Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) are involved in the longer cases and are responsible for "Request Additional Documents". Manager_Bill is also common in both cases for "Approve Claim".

## Step 6: Propose explanations for the root causes of performance issues
The root causes appear to be related to the complexity of the claims and the process of requesting additional documents. High complexity claims require more time for evaluation and often result in multiple requests for additional documents, significantly extending the process duration.

## Step 7: Offer suggestions to mitigate these root causes
1. **Improve Initial Claim Assessment**: Enhance the initial assessment process for high-complexity claims to reduce the need for additional document requests.
2. **Streamline the Request for Additional Documents**: Implement a more efficient process for requesting and processing additional documents, potentially through automation or clearer guidelines.
3. **Resource Training**: Ensure that adjusters handling complex claims are adequately trained and have the necessary expertise.
4. **Managerial Oversight**: Provide Manager_Bill and other approvers with tools or processes to expedite the approval of complex claims without compromising thoroughness.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2003, 2005}$
