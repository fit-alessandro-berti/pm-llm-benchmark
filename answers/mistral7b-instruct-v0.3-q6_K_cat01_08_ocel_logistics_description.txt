 This data represents a sequence of events in an online ordering system for packages, where each event corresponds to a specific action taken by either the customer or the system. The data includes the frequency (number of times the event occurred), number of objects affected (in this case, orders and packages), and duration (time taken for the event to complete).

Here is a simplified description of the process based on the events given:

1. A customer places an order. This triggers the confirmation of the order, which is usually done by the system. The average duration for placing an order is 18600.81 seconds (approx. 5 hours).

2. Once the order is confirmed, the customer proceeds to pay for the order. After payment, the items for the order are picked from inventory. The average durations for paying an order and picking items are 7638.24 seconds (approx. 2 hours) and 7772.19 seconds (approx. 2 hours), respectively.

3. After the items have been picked, they are packaged for shipping. The package is then sent, which triggers the delivery process. The average durations for creating a package, sending a package, and delivering a package are 25911.20 seconds (approx. 7 hours), 16545.44 seconds (approx. 4.5 hours), and 22048.39 seconds (approx. 6 hours), respectively.

4. The delivery process ends when the package is delivered to the customer. At this point, the system may confirm the order's delivery to the customer.

5. It appears that sometimes a customer places an order without making a payment or picking items (the event "place order -> package delivered" occurs with a frequency of 547). In these cases, it is unclear whether the order was ever completed or if it was canceled.

6. There are also events related to packages specifically, such as creating a package and delivering a package. It seems that each created package is sent and then delivered, based on the frequency and duration of these events.
