Based on the provided image, here is a detailed description of the visualization.

### **Overview**
The image displays a **process flow diagram** (specifically a Causal Net or C-net, commonly used in process mining) that models the lifecycle of a request, likely within a customer service or administrative context. The diagram flows generally from left to right and includes a feedback loop.

In the bottom right corner, a **legend** box explains the specific notation used for connecting the process steps.

### **The Process Flow (Main Diagram)**
The process is represented by a series of "nodes" (rounded squares) labeled with a letter (a–z) and a description of the action. Small black dots on the sides of the nodes represent input and output ports, and the lines connecting them (arcs) represent the control flow.

1.  **Start: Register Request (Node a)**
    *   The process begins at node **a ("register request")**.
    *   **Output Logic:** It features an **OR-split** (indicated by curved lines connecting the output dots), meaning the process can branch into one or more of the following three paths simultaneously or selectively.

2.  **Examination Phase (Nodes b, c, d)**
    *   The flow moves to three parallel activities:
        *   **Node b:** "examine thoroughly"
        *   **Node c:** "examine casually"
        *   **Node d:** "check ticket"
    *   **Input Logic:** Each of these nodes has an **OR-join** at its input. This means they can be triggered either by the initial "register request" (a) or by the feedback loop coming from node **f**.

3.  **Decision Point (Node e)**
    *   The paths from **b**, **c**, and **d** converge at node **e ("decide")**.
    *   **Input Logic:** An **OR-join** connects the incoming flows, suggesting the decision can be made once one or a combination of the examination tasks is complete.
    *   **Output Logic:** Node **e** acts as a central hub with an **OR-split**. It distributes the flow to three possible outcomes:
        1.  Forward to **Node g ("pay compensation")**.
        2.  Forward to **Node h ("reject request")**.
        3.  Loop backward to **Node f ("reinitiate request")**.

4.  **Feedback Loop (Node f)**
    *   If the decision at **e** leads to **f ("reinitiate request")**, the flow loops back.
    *   Node **f** connects back to the inputs of nodes **b**, **c**, and **d**, effectively restarting the examination phase.

5.  **Conclusion (Nodes g, h, z)**
    *   If the process moves forward from the decision, it goes to either:
        *   **Node g:** "pay compensation"
        *   **Node h:** "reject request"
    *   Both **g** and **h** lead to the final node, **z ("end")**.
    *   **Input Logic:** The input to node **z** shows the connection points linked, acting as a join to conclude the process regardless of which path (compensation or rejection) was taken.

### **Legend Description**
The grey box in the bottom right defines the logic gates used in the diagram based on how the black connector dots are linked:

*   **XOR (Exclusive OR):** Shown as separate dots with no connecting lines. This implies a choice where only one path is taken (Split) or one path arrives (Join).
*   **AND:** Shown as dots connected by a straight vertical line or bracket. This implies all connected paths happen in parallel (Split) or must wait for each other (Join).
*   **OR:** Shown as dots connected by curved lines (arcs). This implies one or more paths can happen (Split) or merge (Join).
