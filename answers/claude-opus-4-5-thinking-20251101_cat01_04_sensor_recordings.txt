## Detailed Event Groupings and Labels

### **Phase 1: Machine Idle / Startup**
| Events | Timestamp Range | Label |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 1, 2, 3 | 08:00:00 - 08:00:10 | **Idle/Standby** |

**Key Sensor Patterns:**
- Temperature: 20-21°C (ambient)
- Vibration: 0 Hz
- Material Flow: 0 units/s
- Tool Position: 0 mm (home)
- Energy: 0.40-0.50 kWh (minimal)

**Rationale:** All readings are at baseline levels. The machine is powered on (consuming minimal energy) but not performing any active operations. Tool is at home position with no material moving through the system.

---

### **Phase 2: Cutting Metal**
| Events | Timestamp Range | Label |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 4, 5, 6 | 08:00:15 - 08:00:25 | **Cutting Metal** |

**Key Sensor Patterns:**
- Temperature: 505558°C (rapidly increasing)
- Vibration: 303538 Hz (high, increasing)
- Material Flow: 5 units/s (consistent high flow)
- Tool Position: 5710 mm (progressively engaging)
- Energy: 2.002.503.00 kWh (escalating)

**Rationale:** 
- **High vibration** is characteristic of mechanical cutting operations
- **Rising temperature** indicates friction from tool-material contact
- **Progressive tool position** shows the cutting tool advancing through material
- **Consistent material flow** indicates raw material being fed into the cutting operation
- **Increasing energy consumption** reflects the power needed for material removal

### **Phase 3: Assembling Parts**
| Events | Timestamp Range | Label |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 7, 8 | 08:00:30 - 08:00:35 | **Assembling Parts** |

**Key Sensor Patterns:**
- Temperature: 40°C (moderate, stable)
- Pressure: 2 bar (elevated)
- Vibration: 10 Hz (low, stable)
- Material Flow: 2 units/s (reduced)
- Tool Position: 15 mm (fixed)
- Energy: 2.00 kWh (steady)

**Rationale:**
- **Increased pressure** suggests parts being pressed/held together
- **Stable, low vibration** indicates positioning rather than cutting
- **Reduced material flow** represents component feeding rather than raw material
- **Fixed tool position** shows parts being held in place for assembly
- **Consistent readings across events** indicate a controlled assembly operation

---

### **Phase 4: Welding**
| Events | Timestamp Range | Label |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 9 | 08:00:40 | **Welding** |

**Key Sensor Patterns:**
- Temperature: **80°C** (peak temperature)
- Vibration: **50 Hz** (highest reading)
- Material Flow: 0 units/s (stationary)
- Tool Position: 15 mm (same as assembly)
- Energy: **5.00 kWh** (maximum consumption)

**Rationale:**
- **Extreme temperature spike** is the hallmark of welding operations
- **Peak energy consumption** reflects the power required for welding
- **Zero material flow** indicates parts are stationary being joined
- **High vibration** may result from welding arc or resistance welding process
- **Tool position unchanged** from assembly suggests in-place joining of assembled parts

---

### **Phase 5: Quality Inspection**
| Events | Timestamp Range | Label |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 10 | 08:00:45 | **Quality Inspection** |

**Key Sensor Patterns:**
- Temperature: 30°C (cooling down)
- Pressure: 1 bar (baseline)
- Vibration: 1 Hz (near zero)
- Material Flow: 0 units/s
- Tool Position: 15 mm (holding position)
- Energy: 1.00 kWh (low)

**Rationale:**
- **Minimal vibration** suggests no mechanical operation—possibly optical/sensor inspection
- **Low energy** indicates passive monitoring equipment (cameras, sensors)
- **Temperature dropping** shows post-weld cooling during inspection window
- **No material flow** means the product is stationary for measurement
- **Maintained tool position** keeps part in place for quality checks

---

### **Phase 6: Packaging**
| Events | Timestamp Range | Label |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 11, 12 | 08:00:50 - 08:00:55 | **Packaging** |

**Key Sensor Patterns:**
- Temperature: 25°C (near ambient)
- Vibration: 5 Hz (minimal)
- Material Flow: 1 unit/s (light flow)
- Tool Position: 20 mm (final position)
- Energy: 1.50-1.60 kWh (moderate-low)

**Rationale:**
- **Low material flow** likely represents packaging materials (boxes, wrapping)
- **Tool position advanced** to packaging station
- **Low vibration and temperature** indicate gentle handling, not machining
- **Stable, moderate energy** consistent with conveyor/packaging equipment
- **Near-ambient temperature** confirms no heating processes

---

### **Phase 7: Return to Idle**
| Events | Timestamp Range | Label |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 13, 14, 15 | 08:01:00 - 08:01:10 | **Idle/Cycle Complete** |

**Key Sensor Patterns:**
- All readings return to baseline (matching Events 1-3)
- Tool Position: 0 mm (returned to home)

**Rationale:** The machine has completed its cycle and returned to standby state, ready for the next production cycle.

## Conclusion

This process mining analysis successfully transformed unlabeled numerical sensor data into a coherent manufacturing process with six distinct activities. The key insight is that each manufacturing activity produces a **unique signature** across multiple sensor dimensions, allowing reliable classification even without explicit labels.
