Based on the analysis of the events, primarily using the combination of `patient_age` and `patient_gender` as key identifiers for a case, and considering the logical sequence and timing of activities within typical hospital processes, the events can be grouped into three distinct cases:

**Inferred Cases:**

**Case 1: (Patient Age 45, Gender M)**
This case follows a typical Emergency Room (ER) path involving registration, triage, imaging, doctor consultation, and discharge.
*   Event 1: Register patient (45, M, ER)
*   Event 4: Initial triage (45, M, ER)
*   Event 7: X-ray imaging (45, M, Radiology)
*   Event 12: Doctor consultation (45, M, ER) - Diagnosis: hairline_fracture
*   Event 15: Patient discharged (45, M, ER)

**Case 2: (Patient Age 62, Gender F)**
This case also follows an ER path involving registration, triage, lab tests, doctor consultation, prescription, and discharge.
*   Event 2: Register patient (62, F, ER)
*   Event 5: Initial triage (62, F, ER)
*   Event 8: Lab test requested (62, F, ER)
*   Event 10: Lab test completed (62, F, Laboratory)
*   Event 11: Doctor consultation (62, F, ER) - Diagnosis: minor_infection
*   Event 14: Prescription created (62, F, ER)
*   Event 17: Patient discharged (62, F, ER)

**Case 3: (Patient Age 28, Gender M)**
This case follows a scheduled or urgent surgical path starting in Surgery, involving consultation, preparation, surgery, recovery, and discharge.
*   Event 3: Register patient (28, M, Surgery)
*   Event 6: Doctor consultation (28, M, Surgery) - Reason: scheduled_knee_surgery
*   Event 9: Surgery preparation (28, M, Surgery)
*   Event 13: Surgery performed (28, M, Surgery)
*   Event 16: Recovery room (28, M, Surgery)
*   Event 18: Patient discharged (28, M, Surgery)

**Summary of Case Groupings by Event Number:**

*   **Case 1 (45, M):** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
*   **Case 2 (62, F):** Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
*   **Case 3 (28, M):** Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
