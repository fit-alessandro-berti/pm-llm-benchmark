1. Cases with unusually long cycle times  
• Case 101: 2 h 15 m  
• Case 103: 1 h 20 m  
 These two behave as “normal” or fast tickets (baseline  1½–2 hours).  

• Case 102: 25 h 10 m ( 1 day)  
• Case 104: 24 h 10 m ( 1 day)  
• Case 105: 49 h 05 m ( 2 days)  

Compared with the 1½-hour baseline, 102 and 104 are  13–14 times slower, and 105 is  27 times slower. These three tickets are the clear outliers driving average performance down.

2. Observed delay patterns & likely root causes  
Delay figures below are rounded; “gap” = idle time between two consecutive activities.

a. Escalation queue congestion (Cases 102, 105)  
• 102: Escalate  L2-Investigate gap = 2.5 h; L2-Investigate  Resolve = 19 h (overnight).  
• 105: Escalate  L2-Investigate gap = 28 h (spans an entire day); L2-Investigate  Resolve = 19 h.  

Why it hurts: Once a ticket leaves Level 1, it sits in an L2 backlog that is serviced only intermittently (probably one L2 shift per day). Each hand-over therefore adds a full day.

b. Late start of the first investigation, even without escalation (Case 104)  
• Assign  Investigate gap = 3.5 h (agent did not pick it up until after noon).  
• Investigate  Resolve gap = 19 h (overnight).  

Why it hurts: A simple ticket becomes a next-day ticket because the first analysis began too close to the end of a working window.

c. Long post-investigation lag (all slow cases)  
Once investigation finishes, “Resolve” is not executed until the next morning regardless of whether the solution is already known. This implies:  
• Resolution activities are gated by working hours or by an approval queue.  
• There is no policy to close tickets during the same shift.

d. Minor but visible: slower triage for Case 104 (40 min vs 5–25 min in others). Not the main cause, but evidence of workload spikes or staffing variance early in the day.

3. How these factors inflate cycle time  
• Hand-offs add fixed queue time: Every escalation injects at least one additional queue plus an extra “Investigate” step; when the specialized team is staffed only once per day, that queue  1 shift.  
• Working-time boundaries turn a few hours of effort into next-day completions. Finishing an investigation after ~15:00 automatically pushes resolution to the following morning, doubling total duration.  
• Idle windows before the first investigation (Case 104) postpone the entire downstream sequence, creating the same next-day effect even without escalation.

4. Recommendations to remove the bottlenecks  
1. Level-2 coverage & escalation SLA  
• Staff L2 in two overlapping shifts or introduce on-call coverage so escalated tickets are always picked up within (say) 2 hours.  
• Set a formal “escalation  investigation start” SLA and monitor it.  

2. Same-shift closure policy  
• If the root cause is found and fix is ready, allow agents to execute “Resolve” and “Close” immediately, even late in the day.  
• Automate closure for tickets that pass a regression checklist, leaving only exceptions for next-day review.

3. Earlier first-touch on assigned tickets  
• Trigger an alert if “Assign  Investigate” exceeds 1 hour during business hours; redistribute workload or temporarily re-route to an available agent.  

4. Smarter triage & direct-to-L2 routing  
• When the front-line diagnostician can already tell the ticket requires L2, skip the Level-1 assignment and escalate immediately. This removes one queue and 1–3 hours of effort for tickets that end up at L2 anyway.

5. Continuous monitoring dashboard  
Track gap KPIs (Assign  Investigate, Investigate  Resolve, Escalate  L2-Investigate) by day and by team. Visual outlier alerts make it easier to intervene before a ticket crosses the “next-day” threshold.

Implementing the above will address the two biggest delay generators—escalation latency and idle time across shift boundaries—bringing cycle times for complex tickets closer to 4–6 hours instead of 24–48 hours.
