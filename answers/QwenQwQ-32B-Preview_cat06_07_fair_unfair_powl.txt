Alright, I've got this task to create two POWL models based on the hiring process described for GlobalTeq Solutions. One model should show potential unfairness due to community affiliations, and the other should be a fair version without that bias.

First, I need to understand the hiring process steps:

1. **Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check:** An automated system checks resumes for key qualifications. If information is missing, applicants are asked to provide more details.

2. **Preliminary Skill Assessment:** Applicants take an online test. Those who score below a certain threshold are disqualified.

3. **Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check:** This is where potential bias might occur. Applicants with certain affiliations or local community ties might get a slight advantage in the cultural fit evaluation.

4. **Managerial Review & Final Decision:** Hiring managers review borderline candidates, and decisions are made based on the evaluations.

The task is to model this process in POWL, highlighting the potential bias in one model and removing it in the other.

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model, after the skill assessment, there's an XOR choice: one path for a standard cultural fit evaluation and another for a community affiliation check that could give a subtle advantage.

Let's break it down:

- **Start:** ReceiveApplication

- **Data Completeness Check:** Loop until all required data is present.

- **Skill Assessment:** PreliminarySkillAssessment

- **XOR Choice:**

  - **Standard Cultural Fit Check:** CulturalFitCheck

  - **Community Affiliation Check:** CommunityAffiliationCheck

- **Managerial Review:** ManagerialReview

- **Final Decision:** FinalDecision

I need to represent this in POWL, ensuring that the XOR choice is clearly modeled.

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

In this model, all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation without any special branches for community affiliations.

Steps:

- **Start:** ReceiveApplication

- **Data Completeness Check:** Loop until all required data is present.

- **Skill Assessment:** PreliminarySkillAssessment

- **Cultural Fit Check:** CulturalFitCheck

- **Managerial Review:** ManagerialReview

- **Final Decision:** FinalDecision

Again, I need to model this in POWL, ensuring there's no branching based on community affiliations.

### Implementing the Models

I'll use the pm4py library to create these models. Let's start by importing the necessary classes.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator
```

#### Model with Potential Unfairness

1. **Define Activities:**

   - ReceiveApplication

   - DataCompletenessCheck

   - RequestMoreInfo

   - PreliminarySkillAssessment

   - CulturalFitCheck

   - CommunityAffiliationCheck

   - ManagerialReview

   - FinalDecision

2. **Model the Loop for Data Completeness:**

   - A loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo until data is complete.

3. **Model the XOR Choice:**

   - After skill assessment, choose between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

4. **Sequence the Remaining Steps:**

   - ManagerialReview after cultural fit evaluation.

   - FinalDecision after managerial review.

Let's construct this step by step.

```python
# Define transitions
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="PreliminarySkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Define the XOR choice for cultural fit evaluation
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_check, community_affiliation_check])

# Define the partial order
nodes = [receive_application, data_loop, skill_assessment, cultural_fit_xor, managerial_review, final_decision]
powl_model_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Define the order
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_xor)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_xor, managerial_review)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

#### Model Without Unfairness

1. **Define Activities:**

   - Same as above, but without the CommunityAffiliationCheck.

2. **Model the Loop for Data Completeness:**

   - Same as above.

3. **Sequence the Steps:**

   - After skill assessment, directly go to CulturalFitCheck.

   - Then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

```python
# Define transitions (same as above, excluding community_affiliation_check)
# ...

# Define the loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# No XOR choice; directly use cultural_fit_check
# Define the partial order
nodes = [receive_application, data_loop, skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check, managerial_review, final_decision]
powl_model_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Define the order
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_check, managerial_review)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

### Summary

I've created two POWL models:

1. **Unfair Model:** Includes an XOR choice after skill assessment, allowing for a community affiliation check that could introduce bias.

2. **Fair Model:** All applicants follow the same path after skill assessment, undergoing the standard cultural fit check without any branching based on affiliations.

These models should effectively demonstrate the potential for bias in the hiring process and a revised process that avoids it.
