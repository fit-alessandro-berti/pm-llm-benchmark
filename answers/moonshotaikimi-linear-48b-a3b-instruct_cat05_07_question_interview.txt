To really understand how the organization actually operates, I’d like to hear more about the people, the decisions, and the places where the narrative you shared can break down or get “interesting.”

1. How is the volume/urgency of a request communicated to a regional office—email, phone, web form—and how does that immediately affect which regional coordinator (or team) is expected to respond?  
2. When the property coordinator finds missing or outdated documentation, what specific “tolerance” rules exist (e.g., grace period for expired certificates, which documents can be “provisionally accepted,” and who signs off on that decision)?  
3. The central property database is often a primary source of truth; can you walk me through an example of a field that is edited in one system and then propagated to others, and who gets notified if the propagation fails?  
4. When the algorithm (or manager) assigns a property manager, how does the system decide between “round-robin” versus “best-match” logic, and who overrides those rules if the landlord explicitly requests or pushes back against the assignment?  
5. You mentioned “special conditions”; can you give me three concrete examples of landlord demands that have triggered extra process forks or escalations in the past year?  
6. How is the introductory call recorded or summarized for audit purposes, and where does that summary live in relation to the property record and the lease file?  
7. When the inspector’s report flags issues, what dollar threshold or safety rating forces an automatic shutdown versus a contractor quote before re-inspection?  
8. Once marketing assets are live, how does the company protect the property owner’s privacy (e.g., suppressing exact unit number or owner name) while still satisfying regulatory disclosure requirements?  
9. If a property sits “activated” but receives zero tenant interest within a set period, what automatic or manual trigger causes pricing, photos, or amenities to be revisited, and who owns that trigger?  
10. During tenant screening, how does the team decide whether to reject an applicant for income-to-rent ratio versus rental history versus credit score—and can those thresholds ever be manually overridden for luxury or corporate clients?  
11. When multiple offers come in, how is the short-list presented to the landlord if the broker has disclosed an incentive (e.g., $500 off first month) that the platform does not allow to be advertised publicly?  
12. After a lease is signed, what automated test runs (e.g., checking rent-to-cost ratio against portfolio averages) might send the lease back to the property manager for revision, and how is that communicated to the landlord without breach of confidentiality?  
13. For properties needing “special insurance,” who contracts the broker, who pays the premium, and how does that cost roll into the owner’s monthly statement or the tenant’s rent?  
14. Suppose a landlord later insists on adding a custom lease clause after dozens of tenants have already applied—what workflow or exception form is used, and how does it impact already-accepted applications?  
15. How are internal auditors or compliance officers alerted to high-risk properties (e.g., luxury, furnished, short-term) for spot-checks, and what criteria dictate the frequency of those audits?  
16. Can you describe a recent case where the flow of communication broke down between two regional offices on the same property, and what tooling or process change has since prevented it?  
17. When an internal CRM record and an external listing platform diverge (e.g., rent price, square footage), which takes precedence, and how is the discrepancy detected and reconciled?  
18. How does the company measure the success or failure of a newly onboarded property within its first 90 days, and which KPIs feed back into future assignment decisions?  
19. Are there seasonal or cyclical pressures that change resource availability—e.g., fewer certified inspectors in winter or heightened marketing budgets during back-to-school season—and how does that affect sequencing?  
20. Finally, can you give me an example of a property that took unusually long or went off the standard rails, and what “human judgment” moments prolonged or accelerated the onboarding?

These questions are designed to surface the real-world nuance, governance, and exceptions that a neat process narrative often glosses over.
