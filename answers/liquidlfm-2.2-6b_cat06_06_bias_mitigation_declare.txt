# Explanation of Added Constraints:
# 1. **Coexistence Bias Mitigation for Minority Applicants:**
#    When a `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority` decision occurs, "ManualReview" is made mandatory immediately afterward. This prevents immediate bias by pausing the process and allowing a fair review step that considers application beyond sensitivity attributes.
#    
# 2. **ManualReview for Non-Minority Majority:**
#    When `CheckApplicantRace` (a hypothetical activity revealing race) is followed by `Approve_Majority`, `Reject_Majority`, or any decision, a `ManualReview` is triggered to ensure no automatic bias against alternative groups.
#    
# 3. **General and Protective Checks:**
#    - "ManualReview & FinalDecision" ensures oversight by always logging a manual check before final outcomes, maintaining a transparent process.
#    - "RequestAdditionalInfo", "Response", etc., now explicitly map to tightening responding paths, assuming they serve corrective rather than discriminatory intent.
#    
# These constraints disrupt direct biases in sensitive trait-disclosed paths while reinforcing fairness through enforced review at critical junctures. They limit the influence of sensitive country of origin or race determinations by ensuring human-in-the-loop checks post-discovery, mitigating automated bias.
```

### Rationale Summary:
The added constraints directly target two common bias vectors in automated decision systems:
- **Mitigating Immediate Outcomes:** For sensitive groups (e.g., minority applicants), automatically following decision steps after sensitive attribute checks bypasses lack of human review, reducing algorithmic bias.
- **General Fair Oversight:** Mandating manual reviews after sensitive trait disclosures creates a systemic safeguard to audit every biased-outcome path, ensuring no decision is made unaffected by protected attributes.

This maintains *consistency* (both sensitive and non-sensitive applicants follow the same overall flow) while *enforcing fairness* (preventing unjust operator bias).
