### Explanation:

1. **Case Identification**:
   - The cases were identified based on the context of the user's interaction with different applications. Each sequence of events that led to the creation, editing, or saving of a document was considered a separate case. For example, the user's work on "Document1.docx" and "Quarterly_Report.docx" were treated as separate cases.
   - The case "Edit Document1.docx" was created when the user started a new session with this document, and it continued until the user closed the document.
   - Similarly, "Edit Quarterly_Report.docx" was created for the period where the user was focused on this document.

2. **Activity Naming**:
   - The high-level activities were derived from the context of the user’s actions. For example, "Edit Document1.docx" was named based on the starting and closing of the document. Similarly, "Type Draft Intro Paragraph" and "Save Document1.docx" were derived from the specific actions the user performed.
   - Activities like "Switch to Email" and "Reply to Email" were named based on the context of the user's interaction with different applications.

3. **Coherent Narrative**:
   - The final event log tells a coherent story of the user's work sessions. It shows that the user started working on "Document1.docx," saved it, and then switched to "Budget_2024.xlsx" to update the budget figures. After completing that task, the user returned to "Document1.docx" and inserted a reference to the updated budget. The user then switched to "Quarterly_Report.docx" to draft the executive summary and save the document. Finally, the user closed all documents.

This event log is now suitable for process mining analysis, providing a clear narrative of the user's work sessions with standard activities and timestamps.
