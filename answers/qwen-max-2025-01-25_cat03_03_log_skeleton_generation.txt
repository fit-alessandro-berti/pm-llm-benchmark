To construct a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process, we need to carefully analyze the activities and their relationships based on the constraints provided. Below is the step-by-step reasoning for each constraint type:

---

### **1. Equivalence**
The equivalence constraint ensures that if one activity occurs, the other must occur the same number of times. In this scenario:
- **Receive Order (RO)** and **Invoice Customer (IC)** are equivalent because every order received must eventually be invoiced.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)** and **Dispatch (D)** are equivalent because every package with a shipping label must be dispatched.

```python
'equivalence': {('RO', 'IC'), ('GSL', 'D')}
```

---

### **2. Always Before**
The always-before constraint ensures that if the first activity occurs, the second activity must have occurred previously. In this scenario:
- **Check Availability (CA)** must always occur before **Reserve Items (RI)** because items cannot be reserved without confirming availability.
- **Pick Items (PI)** must always occur before **Quality Check (QC)** because items must be picked before they can be inspected.
- **Pack Order (PO)** must always occur before **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)** because the order must be packed before a shipping label can be generated.

```python
'always_before': {('CA', 'RI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('PO', 'GSL')}
```

---

### **3. Always After**
The always-after constraint ensures that if the first activity occurs, the second activity must occur in one of the following events. In this scenario:
- **Reserve Items (RI)** must always be followed by **Pick Items (PI)** because reserved items must eventually be picked.
- **Quality Check (QC)** must always be followed by **Pack Order (PO)** because inspected items must be packed.
- **Dispatch (D)** must always be followed by **Record Payment (RP)** because payment is typically recorded after the order is shipped.

```python
'always_after': {('RI', 'PI'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('D', 'RP')}
```

---

### **4. Never Together**
The never-together constraint ensures that two activities cannot coexist in the same case. In this scenario:
- **Reserve Items (RI)** and **Dispatch (D)** cannot coexist because once items are reserved, they are either picked and shipped or canceled.
- **Invoice Customer (IC)** and **Record Payment (RP)** cannot coexist because an invoice is generated before payment is recorded.

```python
'never_together': {('RI', 'D'), ('IC', 'RP')}
```

---

### **5. Activity Occurrences**
The activity occurrences constraint bounds the number of times an activity can occur in a case. In this scenario:
- **Receive Order (RO)** and **Invoice Customer (IC)** occur exactly once per order.
- **Check Availability (CA)** and **Reserve Items (RI)** occur at most once per order.
- **Pick Items (PI)**, **Quality Check (QC)**, and **Pack Order (PO)** occur at least once but may occur multiple times if there are multiple items in the order.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)** and **Dispatch (D)** occur exactly once per order.
- **Record Payment (RP)** occurs at most once per order.

```python
'activ_freq': {
    'RO': {1}, 
    'CA': {0, 1}, 
    'RI': {0, 1}, 
    'PI': {1, float('inf')}, 
    'QC': {1, float('inf')}, 
    'PO': {1, float('inf')}, 
    'GSL': {1}, 
    'D': {1}, 
    'IC': {1}, 
    'RP': {0, 1}
}
```

---

### **6. Directly-Follows Constraints**
The directly-follows constraint ensures that if the first activity occurs, the second activity must occur immediately after. In this scenario:
- **Receive Order (RO)** is directly followed by **Check Availability (CA)**.
- **Pick Items (PI)** is directly followed by **Quality Check (QC)**.
- **Pack Order (PO)** is directly followed by **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**.

```python
'directly_follows': {('RO', 'CA'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('PO', 'GSL')}
```

---

### **Final Log Skeleton Dictionary**

Combining all the constraints, the final Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton is:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('RO', 'IC'), ('GSL', 'D')},
    'always_before': {('CA', 'RI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('PO', 'GSL')},
    'always_after': {('RI', 'PI'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('D', 'RP')},
    'never_together': {('RI', 'D'), ('IC', 'RP')},
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1}, 
        'CA': {0, 1}, 
        'RI': {0, 1}, 
        'PI': {1, float('inf')}, 
        'QC': {1, float('inf')}, 
        'PO': {1, float('inf')}, 
        'GSL': {1}, 
        'D': {1}, 
        'IC': {1}, 
        'RP': {0, 1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {('RO', 'CA'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('PO', 'GSL')}
}
```

### **Explanation**
This Log Skeleton captures the declarative constraints governing the order fulfillment process. Each constraint type reflects specific business rules and dependencies between activities, ensuring that the process adheres to operational requirements.
