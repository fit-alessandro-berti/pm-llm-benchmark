### Brief Rationale for Added Constraints
- **existence["CheckSensitiveAttributes"]**: Ensures that checking sensitive attributes (e.g., ApplicantRace, ApplicantGender, ApplicantAge) is always part of the process, making bias explicit and requiring handling.
- **existence["ManualReview"]**: Mandates the inclusion of a manual review step in every trace, providing a human oversight mechanism to detect and mitigate potential biases in automated decisions.
- **response["CheckSensitiveAttributes"]["ManualReview"]**: Requires that after any occurrence of checking sensitive attributes, a manual review must eventually follow, preventing unchecked progression to decisions that could be influenced by sensitive data.
- **precedence["ManualReview"]["FinalDecision"]**: Enforces that a manual review must precede any final decision (e.g., Approve or Reject), ensuring bias mitigation occurs before outcomes are determined, thus promoting fairness across demographics.
- **nonsuccession["CheckSensitiveAttributes"]["Reject"]**: Prevents a direct (immediate) succession from checking sensitive attributes to a Reject decision, avoiding snap biased rejections and forcing intermediate steps like manual review for sensitive cases.

### How These Added Constraints Reduce Bias
These constraints integrate fairness checks into the loan application process by forcing the inclusion and sequencing of bias-mitigating activities (e.g., ManualReview after sensitive attribute checks and before decisions). By prohibiting direct paths to potentially biased outcomes like Reject and requiring oversight for all cases involving sensitive attributes, the model limits discriminatory sequences, ensuring consistent and equitable treatment regardless of applicant demographics such as race, gender, or age. This declarative approach promotes transparency and accountability without altering the core process flow.
