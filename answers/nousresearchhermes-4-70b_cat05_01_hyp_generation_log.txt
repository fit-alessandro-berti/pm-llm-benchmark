We are given an event log for order processing and some reference tables. The normal process flow is:
1. Register Order (Sales)
2. Perform Credit Check (Finance)
3. Validate Stock (Warehouse)
4. Confirm Shipment (Logistics)
5. Ship Goods (Logistics)
6. Issue Invoice (Finance)
7. Receive Payment (Finance)

However, looking at the example data, we can see some anomalies. Let's break down each case_id:

Case 1001: 
  Events: 
    1. Register Order -> 2. Perform Credit Check -> 3. Validate Stock -> 4. Confirm Shipment -> 5. Ship Goods -> 6. Issue Invoice -> 7. Receive Payment
  This follows the normal flow.

Case 1002:
  Events:
    8. Register Order -> 9. Confirm Shipment -> 10. Ship Goods -> 11. Perform Credit Check -> 12. Validate Stock -> 13. Issue Invoice -> 14. Receive Payment
  Anomaly: Steps 2-4 (Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment) are out of order. 
    Specifically, "Confirm Shipment" and "Ship Goods" happened before "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock". 
    This is a violation of the assumed process because credit and stock validation should happen before shipment.

Case 1003:
  Events:
    15. Register Order -> 16. Perform Credit Check -> 17. Ship Goods -> 18. Issue Invoice -> 19. Confirm Shipment -> 20. Receive Payment
  Anomaly: 
    - Step 19 (Confirm Shipment) happens after Step 17 (Ship Goods). Normally, confirmation should be before shipment.
    - Also, Validate Stock is missing.

Case 1004:
  Events:
    21. Register Order -> 22. Receive Payment -> 23. Issue Invoice -> 24. Confirm Shipment -> 25. Ship Goods
  Anomaly:
    - Receive Payment (event 22) happens very early, right after Register Order and before any other steps (like credit check, validate stock, etc.). This might imply prepayment, but then why issue invoice after payment? 
    - The normal flow expects credit check and stock validation before shipment. Here, even after payment, we have:
        - Issue Invoice (event 23)
        - Confirm Shipment (event 24) which is set to 'shipment_scheduled=N' (meaning not scheduled? but then shipped? or perhaps it means the shipment was not scheduled at that time? but event 25 is Ship Goods)
        - Ship Goods (event 25)
    - Also, note that the credit check and validate stock activities are missing entirely.

So, the main anomalies are:
1. Out-of-order activities (Case 1002 and 1003).
2. Missing activities (Case 1003: missing Validate Stock; Case 1004: missing Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock).
3. Early payment and invoice after payment (Case 1004).

Hypotheses for these anomalies:
1. System errors: The order processing system might have bugs leading to out-of-order execution or skipping steps.
2. Policy violations: Employees might be bypassing steps (e.g., to expedite an order) which should be logged but isn't.
3. Training issues: Workers might not be properly trained on the process flow.
4. Exceptional cases: Some orders might be handled differently (e.g., priority orders, prepayment orders). For example, in Case 1004, the order is of type 'standard' but has a high value (3000). However, the missing steps are critical (credit and stock). 
   - The order type for Case 1002 is 'priority'. Maybe priority orders have a different flow? But the normal flow description doesn't specify variant flows.

We can write SQL queries to investigate:

1. To find cases that do not follow the standard sequence:
   - We expect the sequence of activities to be: 'Register Order', then 'Perform Credit Check', then 'Validate Stock', then 'Confirm Shipment', then 'Ship Goods', then 'Issue Invoice', then 'Receive Payment'.
   - We can check for each case the order of activities by timestamp and see if they follow.

2. To find missing activities in the process for each case:
   - For each case, we should have 7 activities. We can group by case_id and count events, and also check for the presence of each activity.

3. To check if the anomalies are correlated with order type, customer, resource, etc.

Let's write some queries:

Query 1: Find cases that have out-of-order activities according to the normal process.
  We can assign a step number to each activity and then check if the timestamp order matches the step order within a case.

Query 2: Find cases that are missing any of the expected activities.

Query 3: For cases that have anomalies, join with the `orders` table to see order_type and order_value, and with `resources` table to see who performed the activities.

Query 4: Check if the out-of-order activities are performed by the same resource or different.

But note: The prompt says "Propose relevant SQL queries ... without any hints or guidance provided here."

Let me write the queries:

Query 1: Check for out-of-order events in the normal process.
  We create a mapping of activity to step number and then compare the step number order with timestamp order per case.

```sql
WITH activity_sequence AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    event_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    activity AS activity_name,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS event_order
  FROM order_event_log
),
step_definition AS (
  SELECT activity,
    CASE 
      WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN 1
      WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
      WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
      WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
      WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
      WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
      WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
    END AS step
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY activity
)
SELECT 
  asq.case_id,
  asq.event_id,
  asq.activity,
  asq.timestamp,
  asq.event_order,
  sd.step
FROM activity_sequence asq
JOIN step_definition sd ON asq.activity = sd.activity
WHERE sd.step IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY asq.case_id, asq.timestamp;
```

But this doesn't show the out-of-order directly. We can compare the step with the event_order? Actually, we want to see if the step order matches the event_order? 
Alternatively, we can assign the step number and then check if the step number increases with event_order within a case.

We can do:

```sql
WITH activity_step AS (
  SELECT 
    oel.*,
    CASE 
      WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN 1
      WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
      WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
      WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
      WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
      WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
      WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
    END AS step
  FROM order_event_log oel
)
SELECT 
  as1.case_id,
  as1.event_id,
  as1.activity,
  as1.timestamp,
  as1.step,
  LAG(step) OVER (PARTITION BY as1.case_id ORDER BY as1.timestamp) AS prev_step,
  LAG(step) OVER (PARTITION BY as1.case_id ORDER BY as1.timestamp) < as1.step AS step_order_correct
FROM activity_step as1
ORDER BY as1.case_id, as1.timestamp;
```

We are looking for rows where `step_order_correct` is false (i.e., the current step is less than the previous step, meaning it went backward, or jumps are not 1? but steps are not necessarily consecutive numbers in the log because we assign integer steps). Actually, we want the step to increase by 1? Not exactly, because we have 7 steps. But the step numbers are 1,2,3,...,7. So we expect each step to be exactly one more than the previous? But note: the log might not have consecutive integers? Actually, the step numbers are fixed. So we can check if the step number is the next integer? 

Alternatively, we can check if the step number is greater than the previous step? Because the step numbers are increasing in the normal flow.

So in the above query, the `step_order_correct` is: (previous step < current step). We want that to be true for the normal flow. If false, then there's an anomaly.

But note: the first event in a case: there is no previous step, so we skip.

We can then filter for rows where `step_order_correct` is false.

Query 2: Check for missing activities per case.

```sql
WITH expected_activities AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM order_event_log
  -- But note: we know the expected activities? They are the ones in the normal flow: 
  -- 'Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment'
),
case_activities AS (
  SELECT 
    oel.case_id,
    oa.activity
  FROM expected_activities oa
  LEFT JOIN order_event_log oel ON oa.activity = oel.activity
  RIGHT JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) cases ON oel.case_id = cases.case_id
)
SELECT 
  case_id,
  activity
FROM case_activities
WHERE case_activities.activity IS NULL;
```

But this will show for which case an activity is missing.

Alternatively, we can group by case_id and list the present activities and then compare.

Query 3: Join the anomaly cases with the `orders` table to get order type and value.

For example, for cases that have out-of-order events (from Query1) or missing events (from Query2), we can join with orders.

We can do:

```sql
-- Using the step_order_correct query from above, but now let's get the case_ids that have at least one stepOrderCorrect=false (excluding the first event)
WITH activity_step AS (
  SELECT 
    oel.case_id,
    oel.event_id,
    oel.activity,
    oel.timestamp,
    oel.resource,
    oel.additional_info,
    CASE 
      WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN 1
      WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
      WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
      WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
      WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
      WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
      WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
    END AS step
  FROM order_event_log oel
),
order_sequence AS (
  SELECT 
    as1.case_id,
    as1.event_id,
    as1.activity,
    as1.timestamp,
    as1.step,
    LAG(step) OVER (PARTITION BY as1.case_id ORDER BY as1.timestamp) AS prev_step,
    CASE 
      WHEN LAG(step) OVER (PARTITION BY as1.case_id ORDER BY as1.timestamp) IS NULL THEN true
      ELSE LAG(step) OVER (PARTITION BY as1.case_id ORDER BY as1.timestamp) < as1.step
    END AS step_order_correct
  FROM activity_step as1
)
SELECT 
  os.case_id,
  o.order_type,
  o.order_value,
  os.event_id,
  os.activity,
  os.timestamp,
  os.step,
  os.prev_step,
  os.step_order_correct
FROM order_sequence os
JOIN orders o ON os.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE os.step_order_correct = false;
```

Similarly, for missing activities:

```sql
WITH expected_activities AS (
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN 1
      WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
      WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
      WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
      WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
      WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
      WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
    END AS step,
    activity
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY activity
),
case_activities AS (
  SELECT 
    oel.case_id,
    ea.activity AS expected_activity,
    ea.step
  FROM expected_activities ea
  LEFT JOIN order_event_log oel ON ea.activity = oel.activity AND ea.step = 
    (SELECT CASE 
        WHEN oel2.activity = 'Register Order' THEN 1
        WHEN oel2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
        WHEN oel2.activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
        WHEN oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
        WHEN oel2.activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
        WHEN oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
        WHEN oel2.activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
      END
     FROM dual) -- This doesn't work, we need to do differently.
)
-- Alternatively, we can do:
-- Create a CTE for each case and the activities present, then left join with expected_activities and find nulls.

-- Let me do:

WITH case_events AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    CASE 
      WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN 1
      WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
      WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
      WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
      WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
      WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
      WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
    END AS step
  FROM order_event_log
),
cases_covered AS (
  SELECT 
    ce.case_id,
    ce.activity
  FROM case_events ce
),
missing_activities AS (
  SELECT 
    c.case_id,
    ea.activity
  FROM (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) c
  CROSS JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM order_event_log) ea
  LEFT JOIN cases_covered cc ON c.case_id = cc.case_id AND ea.activity = cc.activity
  WHERE cc.case_id IS NULL
)
SELECT 
  ma.case_id,
  ma.activity,
  o.order_type,
  o.order_value
FROM missing_activities ma
JOIN orders o ON ma.case_id = o.case_id;
```

Query 4: Check the resources involved in the activities that are out of order.

We can extend Query1 to include the resource and then group by case_id and resource.

But let's stick to the above.

We can also check for the case 1004: early payment and then invoice. We can write a query to find cases where "Receive Payment" happens before "Issue Invoice".

```sql
SELECT 
  oel.case_id,
  MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS payment_time,
  MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS invoice_time
FROM order_event_log oel
GROUP BY oel.case_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) < MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END);
```

But note: in case 1004, the invoice happened after payment? Actually, in the data, for case 1004:
  event_id 22: Receive Payment at 2024-02-01 09:05:00
  event_id 23: Issue Invoice at 2024-02-01 09:20:00

So payment time is before invoice time? That is unusual because normally you issue an invoice before receiving payment. But sometimes (like prepayment) it might be acceptable. However, the process flow doesn't account for prepayment.

So we can flag these.

But note: the example data only has 4 cases, so we can write a query to check the order of payment and invoice.

We can also check for the time between events to see if any step was skipped too quickly? But that might be more advanced.

These queries should help in investigating the anomalies.

### Identified Anomalies and Hypotheses

1. **Out-of-Order Process Flow**:
   - **Cases**: `1002`, `1003`
   - **Anomaly**: 
     - `1002`: "Confirm Shipment"  "Ship Goods"  "Perform Credit Check" (credit check occurs **after** shipment).
     - `1003`: "Ship Goods" occurs **before** "Confirm Shipment".
   - **Hypothesis**: 
     - Rushed processing of priority/standard orders (e.g., `1002` is labeled "priority").
     - System error in sequence enforcement or manual policy bypass.

2. **Missing Critical Activities**:
   - **Case**: `1003`
   - **Anomaly**: "Validate Stock" is missing entirely.
   - **Hypothesis**: 
     - Stock validation skipped to expedite shipping.
     - System error logging failure.

3. **Reversed Payment-Invoice Flow**:
   - **Case**: `1004`
   - **Anomaly**: 
     - "Receive Payment" occurs **before** both stock validation, credit check, and "Issue Invoice".
   - **Hypothesis**: 
     - Prepayment scenario (e.g., high-value order `order_value=3000.00`), but missing upstream checks.
     - Invoice generated post-payment for compliance, risking non-compliance.

4. **Post-Shipment Activity Discrepancy**:
   - **Case**: `1004`
   - **Anomaly**: "Confirm Shipment" occurs **after** "Ship Goods" with `additional_info=shipment_scheduled=N`.
   - **Hypothesis**: 
     - Last-minute cancellation or operational error requiring reconfirmation.
     - System mislogging event sequence.

### Proposed SQL Queries for Investigation

#### **Query 1: Detect Out-of-Order Activities**
```sql
WITH activity_sequence AS (
  SELECT 
    event_id,
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY case_id 
      ORDER BY timestamp
    ) AS actual_seq
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT 
  a.case_id,
  a.activity AS current_activity,
  LAG(a.activity) OVER (
    PARTITION BY a.case_id 
    ORDER BY a.timestamp
  ) AS prev_activity,
  a.timestamp
FROM activity_sequence a
WHERE 
  (a.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND LAG(a.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY a.case_id ORDER BY a.timestamp) = 'Ship Goods') OR
  (a.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND LAG(a.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY a.case_id ORDER BY a.timestamp) = 'Ship Goods');
```
**Purpose**: Flags cases where `Confirm Shipment` follows `Ship Goods` or `Credit Check` occurs post-shipment, violating the normal flow.

---

#### **Query 2: Identify Missing Activities per Case**
```sql
WITH expected_activities AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    COUNT(*) AS event_count
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id, activity
),
required_activities AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT activity 
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT 
  e.case_id,
  ra.activity AS missing_activity
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) e
CROSS JOIN required_activities ra
LEFT JOIN expected_activities ea 
  ON e.case_id = ea.case_id 
  AND ra.activity = ea.activity
WHERE ea.case_id IS NULL;
```
**Purpose**: Lists all activities required by the standard process (`Register Order`, `Credit Check`, `Validate Stock`, etc.) that are missing per case (e.g., `Validate Stock` in `1003`).

---

#### **Query 3: Investigate Payment-Invoice Anomalies**
```sql
SELECT 
  oel.case_id,
  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS payment_time,
  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS invoice_time,
  o.order_type,
  o.order_value
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN orders o ON oel.case_id = o.case_id
GROUP BY oel.case_id, o.order_type, o.order_value
HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) < 
       MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END);
```
**Purpose**: Identifies cases where payment precedes invoice issuance (e.g., `1004`), cross-referenced with order type/value for context.

---

#### **Query 4: Check Resource Roles in Anomalous Events**
```sql
SELECT 
  oel.case_id,
  oel.activity,
  oel.resource,
  r.role,
  r.department,
  oel.additional_info
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE oel.case_id IN (1002, 1003, 1004);
```
**Purpose**: 
- Determines if violations correlate with specific roles/departments (e.g., `Logistics` skipping credit checks).
- Reviews `additional_info` for insights (e.g., `shipment_scheduled=N` in `1004`).

---

#### **Query 5: Analyze Time Gaps Between Critical Steps**
```sql
WITH event_durations AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    LEAD(timestamp) OVER (
      PARTITION BY case_id 
      ORDER BY timestamp
    ) AS next_timestamp
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT
  ed.case_id,
  ed.activity AS current_activity,
  ed_next.activity AS next_activity,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ed_next.next_timestamp - ed.timestamp)) / 60 AS minutes_gap
FROM event_durations ed
JOIN event_durations ed_next 
  ON ed.case_id = ed_next.case_id 
  AND ed.timestamp = ed_next.timestamp
WHERE 
  (ed.activity = 'Register Order' AND ed_next.activity NOT IN ('Perform Credit Check')) OR
  (ed.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND ed_next.activity != 'Validate Stock');
```
**Purpose**: Flags short/unusual gaps between steps violating sequence rules (e.g., `1002` jumping from `Register Order` to `Confirm Shipment` in 5 minutes).

---

### Key Insights from Results
- **High-Risk Cases**:
  - `1002` (priority): Bypassed credit check until after shipment.
  - `1003`/`1004` (standard): Incomplete/no validation and reversed financial flow.
- **Resource Patterns**: 
  - `Logistics` roles frequently involved in sequence bypasses.
  - `Finance` resources payments predating core validations.
- **Process Gaps**: 
  - High-value orders (`1004`) lack critical pre-shipment checks.
  - Priority orders (`1002`) show rushed execution.

### Recommended Actions
1. **System Audit**: Enforce step dependencies in the workflow engine.
2. **Training**: Address role-specific process deviations (e.g., `Logistics` skipping credit checks).
3. **Compliance Review**: Validate reversed payment-invoice cases for audit trail adequacy (e.g., `1004`).
