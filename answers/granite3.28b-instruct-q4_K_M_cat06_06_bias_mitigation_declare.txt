**Explanation:**

1. **Coexistence Constraints (`Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`):** 
   - These constraints ensure that whenever a sensitive decision is made for an applicant from a minority group (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`), there must also be a `ManualReview`. This step introduces human oversight to check if the automated decision was fair, mitigating potential algorithmic bias.

2. **Response and Succession Constraints (`CheckApplicantRace` and `BiasMitigationCheck`):**
   - These constraints prevent immediate decisions after checking sensitive attributes like `ApplicantRace` without an intervening `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that any potential biases flagged by the attribute check are examined before a final decision is made, reducing the risk of discriminatory outcomes.

3. **Non-succession Constraint (`RequestAdditionalInfo_NonMinority` and `BiasMitigationCheck_NonMinority`):**
   - This constraint enforces that non-minority applicants also undergo a `BiasMitigationCheck` before reaching the final decision, ensuring consistency in applying bias mitigation strategies across all demographic groups.
