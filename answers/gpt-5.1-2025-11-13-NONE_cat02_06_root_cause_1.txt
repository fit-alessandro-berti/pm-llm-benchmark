1. Cases with significantly longer resolution times

Compute total cycle time per case (from “Receive Ticket” to “Close Ticket”):

- **Case 101:** 2024-03-01 08:00  10:15 (same day)  
   **2h 15m**

- **Case 103:** 2024-03-01 08:10  09:30 (same day)  
   **1h 20m**

- **Case 102:** 2024-03-01 08:05  2024-03-02 09:15  
   **25h 10m**

- **Case 104:** 2024-03-01 08:20  2024-03-02 08:30  
   **24h 10m**

- **Case 105:** 2024-03-01 08:25  2024-03-03 09:30  
   **49h 5m**

Baseline (normal) cases are 101 and 103 (1–2 hours).  
**Significantly delayed cases: 102, 104, and 105** (around 1–2 days, with 105 being the worst).

2. Likely root causes from the event patterns

### A. Escalations to Level-2 Agents

- **Case 102:** Escalation at 11:30, final resolution next day 09:00.  
  Long gap: 2024-03-01 14:00 (L2 investigate)  2024-03-02 09:00 (resolve): **~19 hours**.
- **Case 105:** Escalation at 10:00 on 2024-03-01, L2 investigates only at 14:00 on 2024-03-02  
  Gap: **~28 hours** between escalation and L2 investigation.

Impact:  
Escalated tickets wait a long time before Level-2 actually investigates and/or resolves. This suggests a **Level-2 capacity or prioritization bottleneck**.

### B. Long waiting times before / between investigations

- **Case 104:**  
  - Assign L1: 2024-03-01 09:30  
  - Investigate: 2024-03-01 13:00  
  Gap: **3.5 hours** from assignment to investigation.  
  - Investigate end: 13:00 (same timestamp for start, but assume investigation is at that time)  
  - Resolve: 2024-03-02 08:00  
  Gap: **~19 hours** between investigation and resolution.

- **Case 102:**  
  - Escalate: 11:30  
  - L2 Investigate: 14:00  
  Gap: **2.5 hours**.  
  - Investigate: 14:00  Resolve: next day 09:00  
  Gap: **~19 hours** until resolution.

- **Case 105:**  
  - Escalate: 10:00 (Mar 1)  
  - L2 Investigate: 14:00 (Mar 2)  
  Gap: **~28 hours**.  
  - L2 Investigate: 14:00 (Mar 2)  Resolve: 09:00 (Mar 3)  
  Gap: **~19 hours**.

Impact:  
Most of the extra time in delayed cases is **idle wait time**, not actual processing steps. Key wait points:
- After escalation to L2
- Between L2 investigation and resolution
- Before first investigation in some L1 cases (like 104)

This indicates **queueing / scheduling delays** and possibly tickets being paused overnight or across shifts.

### C. Delay before first investigation

Compare fast vs slow cases:

- **Fast cases:**
  - Case 101: Receive 08:00  Investigate 09:00 (1h)  
  - Case 103: Receive 08:10  Investigate 08:45 (35m)

- **Slow cases:**
  - Case 104: Receive 08:20  Investigate 13:00 (4h 40m total from receipt)  
    - Particularly, 09:30  13:00 after assignment is long.
  - Case 105: Receive 08:25  Investigate 09:10 (45m)  Escalate 10:00 (reasonable up to here; delays occur after escalation).

Impact:  
When investigation does not start quickly (case 104), **early idle time** contributes directly to longer total cycle time.

3. How these factors increase cycle time & recommendations

### How they increase cycle time

- **Escalation-related waits:**  
  Every escalation introduces a handoff. In these logs, handoffs to Level-2 are followed by long gaps before L2 activities. That implies tickets sit in a **Level-2 queue**, which directly adds many hours to cycle time.

- **Queueing before investigation or resolution:**  
  Large gaps between:
  - Assign  Investigate (L1 or L2), and  
  - Investigate  Resolve  
  suggest that work is being done in batches, only during certain shifts, or with insufficient staffing. The actual work (investigation, resolution) appears short; the **waiting dominates**.

- **Overnight and multi-day delays:**  
  For 102, 104, 105, key transitions happen late in the day and final actions appear next morning or even next day. This suggests:
  - Work is being deferred across days (e.g., end-of-day backlog), or
  - Priority / SLA categories may allow tickets to wait overnight.

### Recommendations to address bottlenecks

1. **Strengthen Level-2 capacity and responsiveness**
   - Monitor **L2 queue length** and **average time from escalation  first L2 action**.
   - Add L2 coverage during peak hours or extend coverage to reduce overnight waits.
   - Introduce **SLA for L2 response time** (e.g., first L2 action within 2 hours of escalation).

2. **Prioritize and fast-track escalated and investigated tickets**
   - Once a ticket has been escalated or investigated, treat it as **high priority** until resolved, to avoid long gaps between:
     - Escalation  L2 investigation
     - Investigation  Resolution
   - Use alerts/dashboards to flag tickets that have had no activity for a set threshold (e.g., >2–4 hours active business time).

3. **Reduce delay before first investigation (L1)**
   - For cases like 104, ensure:
     - Triage  Assign  Investigate happen in a tight timeframe for standard tickets.
   - Consider a target: **start investigation within 1 hour of assignment** for normal-priority tickets.

4. **Clarify working-hours effect**
   - Check if tickets are being left until the next working day because of shift-end. If so:
     - Either provide **overlapping shifts** or
     - Explicitly set expectations / SLAs that reflect this (e.g., “resolution in X business hours”).
   - Implement process rules to avoid making non-urgent escalations just before shift-end if they will inevitably wait many hours.

5. **Standardize escalation criteria**
   - Ensure L1 agents escalate only when needed and as early as possible:
     - Case 105 escalates at 10:00 after investigation at 09:10; this is reasonable, but if complex issues are identifiable earlier, **earlier escalation** could reduce total time.

If you’d like, I can turn this into a simple KPI set (e.g., avg time per step, per level, per case type) that you could track on a dashboard.
