**Case 1:**
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Authorize payment
- Package items
- Ship order
- Close order

**Case 2:**
- Receive order
- Check inventory

**Case 3:**

**Case 4:**
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Cancel order
- Close order

**Case 5:**
- Receive order

- Authorize payment
- Ship order
- Close order

### Analysis of Violations

**Case 1:**
- This case follows the normative process correctly:
  - Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
- No violations are observed.

**Case 2:**
- **Violation:** The activity "Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment."
  - **Explanation:** According to the normative process, "Package items" should only occur after payment has been authorized. This violation disrupts the logical flow where payment authorization ensures that the customer’s payment method is valid before items are prepared for shipment.

**Case 3:**
- **Violation:** The activity "Ship order" occurs *after* "Cancel order."
  - **Explanation:** Once an order is canceled, it is illogical to proceed with fulfillment activities such as shipping. Additionally, the presence of "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" is also questionable, but the most egregious violation is attempting to ship after cancellation.
- **Violation:** The activity "Authorize payment" occurs *before* "Cancel order."
  - **Explanation:** Payment should not be authorized if the order is going to be canceled due to insufficient inventory.

**Case 4:**
- This case follows the normative process correctly for insufficient inventory:
  - Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.
- No violations are observed.

**Case 5:**
- **Violation:** The activity "Ship order" occurs *before* "Package items."
  - **Explanation:** Items must be packaged before they can be shipped. This sequence ensures that the items are properly prepared before being sent out.
- **Additional Violation:** The activity "Package items" is missing.
  - **Explanation:** The process requires that items be packaged before shipping. Skipping this step is a clear violation of the normative process.

### Summary of Violations

- **Case 2:** Violates the sequence by packaging items before authorizing payment.
- **Case 3:** Violates the sequence by shipping an order after it has been canceled and by authorizing payment before canceling the order.
- **Case 5:** Violates the sequence by shipping an order without packaging items and by skipping the "Package items" step entirely.

These violations highlight deviations from the expected logical flow of activities, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the order handling process.
