### Rationale for Added Constraints

- **existence("ManualReview")**: Guarantees that every loan application trace includes a manual human review, preventing fully automated decisions that could embed bias.
- **responded_existence(FinalDecision → ManualReview)** and **coexistence(ManualReview ↔ FinalDecision)**: Ensures that whenever a final decision is made, a manual review has occurred (and vice versa), enforcing human oversight in all decided cases.
- **response(CheckSensitiveAttributes → ManualReview)**: Forces a manual review to occur at some point after sensitive attributes (age, gender, race) are examined.
- **precedence(ManualReview → FinalDecision)**: Prohibits any final decision unless a manual review has already taken place earlier in the trace.
- **succession(ManualReview → FinalDecision)**: Strengthens the ordering by requiring manual review and final decision to be causally linked in sequence.
- **chainresponse / chainprecedence / chainsuccession involving ManualReview and FinalDecision/CheckSensitiveAttributes**: Enforces strict immediate succession between checking sensitive data, manual review, and final decision, eliminating any intermediate automated steps that could introduce bias.
- **noncoexistence(CheckSensitiveAttributes, FinalDecision)**: Prevents traces where sensitive attributes are checked but no final decision is reached without proper mitigation (forces consistent handling).
- **nonchainsuccession(CheckSensitiveAttributes → Reject)**: Explicitly forbids an immediate rejection right after examining sensitive attributes, blocking a common path for potential discriminatory fast-rejection.

Together, these constraints significantly reduce the risk of bias by mandating human manual review as an obligatory, ordered, and immediate step whenever sensitive applicant attributes are involved, before any final decision (especially rejection) can be made. This promotes fairness, transparency, and consistency across all demographic groups in the loan application process.
