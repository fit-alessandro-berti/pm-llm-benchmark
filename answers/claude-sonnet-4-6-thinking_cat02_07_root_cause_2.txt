# Insurance Claims Processing – Performance Analysis

---

## 1. Case Duration Analysis

The first step is to compute the end-to-end lead time for each case by comparing the timestamp of the first event (Submit Claim) to the last event (Close Claim).

| Case ID | Start Timestamp   | End Timestamp     | Total Duration | Complexity | Region |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00  | 2024-04-01 10:30  | **~1.5 hours** | Low        | A      |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05  | 2024-04-02 11:00  | **~26 hours**  | Medium     | B      |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10  | 2024-04-03 09:30  | **~48 hours**  | High       | A      |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20  | 2024-04-01 10:45  | **~1.4 hours** | Low        | B      |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25  | 2024-04-04 14:30  | **~77 hours**  | High       | B      |

###  Cases with Performance Issues:
- **Case 2003** (~48 hours) — **20–30× longer** than the low-complexity baseline
- **Case 2005** (~77 hours) — **50× longer** than the low-complexity baseline; the worst offender
- **Case 2002** (~26 hours) — Moderately slow; worth monitoring

Cases **2001** and **2004** serve as the performance benchmark at ~1.5 hours each.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis by Attribute

### 2.1 Complexity — The Primary Driver

The most striking correlation is between claim complexity and duration:

| Complexity | Cases        | Avg. Duration | # of Doc. Requests |
|------------|--------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Low        | 2001, 2004   | ~1.5 hours    | 0                  |
| Medium     | 2002         | ~26 hours     | 1                  |
| High       | 2003, 2005   | ~62 hours     | 2–3                |

> **Finding:** Every increase in complexity level brings a dramatic increase in duration, driven directly by the number of **"Request Additional Documents"** cycles.

Each document request cycle introduces multi-hour (often overnight) waiting periods for the customer to respond. The cumulative wait time dwarfs all other process steps:

**Breakdown of wait time in Case 2005:**
| Step                                  | Wait Time      |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| Evaluate  1st Doc Request            | ~1.7 hours     |
| 1st Request  2nd Request             | **~29.5 hours**|
| 2nd Request  3rd Request             | **~22 hours**  |
| 3rd Request  Approve                 | **~19 hours**  |
| Approve  Pay  Close                 | ~4.5 hours     |

The three document request cycles alone account for **~70+ hours** of waiting.

### 2.2 Resource — Adjuster Behavior Varies

| Adjuster       | Region | Cases Handled      | High-Complexity Doc Requests |
|----------------|--------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Adjuster_Mike  | A      | 2001, 2003         | 2 (Case 2003)                |
| Adjuster_Lisa  | B      | 2002, 2004, 2005   | 3 (Case 2005)                |

Both adjusters performed identically on low-complexity cases (fast, no document requests). However, on **high-complexity** claims:

- **Adjuster_Mike** needed **2 rounds** of document requests (Case 2003  48 hrs)
- **Adjuster_Lisa** needed **3 rounds** of document requests (Case 2005  77 hrs)

> **Finding:** Adjuster_Lisa appears to be iterating through document requests one at a time rather than identifying all missing documents upfront. This may indicate insufficient experience with complex claims, a lack of structured checklists, or a tendency toward reactive (rather than proactive) documentation gathering. Each additional cycle adds ~20–30 hours to the case.

Additionally, for **Manager approvals**:
| Manager       | Cases Approved    | Avg. Approval Speed |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Manager_Ann   | 2001, 2002, 2004  | Fast (same day)     |
| Manager_Bill  | 2003, 2005        | Slow (next day+)    |

Manager_Bill exclusively handles the high-complexity cases and takes significantly longer to approve, though this may be partially justified by the nature of high-complexity claims. Still, this concentration warrants review.

### 2.3 Region — A Secondary Compounding Factor

| Region | Cases                    | Performance Pattern                    |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| A      | 2001 (Low), 2003 (High)  | Fast on Low; Moderate delay on High    |
| B      | 2002 (Med), 2004 (Low), 2005 (High) | Fast on Low; Worst delay on High |

When comparing the **two high-complexity cases** directly:
- **Case 2003 (Region A, Adjuster_Mike):** 48 hours, 2 doc requests
- **Case 2005 (Region B, Adjuster_Lisa):** 77 hours, 3 doc requests

Region B's high-complexity case took **~60% longer** than Region A's equivalent. While this partially reflects Adjuster_Lisa's handling, it may also indicate:
- Different regional documentation standards or regulatory requirements
- Less experienced support staff or lower resource availability in Region B
- Longer customer response times in Region B

> **Finding:** Region B shows a compounding disadvantage for complex claims — less efficient adjuster behavior + potentially slower regional processing — making it the highest-risk combination.

## 3. Summary of Root Causes

```
Root Cause 1 — HIGH COMPLEXITY  Multiple Document Request Cycles
 Each cycle introduces 20–30 hours of waiting time
 High-complexity claims with 3 cycles take 50× longer than low-complexity ones

Root Cause 2 — ADJUSTER_LISA  Reactive Document Gathering
 Requests documents one batch at a time instead of comprehensively upfront
 Results in 3 cycles vs. 2 cycles for comparable high-complexity claims
 Amplifies the delay introduced by Root Cause 1

Root Cause 3 — REGION B + HIGH COMPLEXITY  Compounding Effect
 Region B handles complex claims less efficiently than Region A
 Longest case (2005) is the intersection of High Complexity + Region B + Adjuster_Lisa
```

## 4. Recommendations

###  Short-Term
| Problem                                  | Recommendation                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multiple document request cycles         | Introduce **complexity-tiered document checklists** so adjusters request all required documents in a single, comprehensive request upfront |
| Adjuster_Lisa's iterative approach       | Provide **targeted coaching/training** on high-complexity claim documentation requirements; pair with Adjuster_Mike as a mentor |
| Long customer response waiting times     | Implement **automated follow-up reminders** to customers (e.g., at 24h and 48h after a request) to reduce idle waiting time |
| Manager_Bill bottleneck                  | Review Manager_Bill's approval workload; consider **workload balancing** or delegating pre-screening of high-complexity approvals |

###  Medium-Term
| Problem                                  | Recommendation                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Region B performance gap                 | Conduct a **regional process audit** to identify differences in workflows, staffing, or regulatory requirements between Regions A and B |
| High-complexity claim routing            | Create a **specialized high-complexity claims team** (dedicated experienced adjusters + senior managers) to handle these cases with a standardized, efficient process |
| Process redesign for document collection | Allow customers to **self-serve document submission** via a portal immediately after Submit Claim, reducing dependency on iterative requests |

###  Long-Term
- Introduce **predictive complexity scoring** at submission to flag high-complexity cases immediately and route them to specialist handlers
- Build a **process monitoring dashboard** tracking real-time KPIs (e.g., number of document request cycles per adjuster, average time between request and response) to enable proactive intervention

---

## 5. Conclusion

The root causes of performance issues in this process are **not random** — they form a clear, attributable pattern:

> **High complexity  more document cycles  exponentially longer cases**, amplified by **inexperienced or poorly-supported adjusters** (particularly Adjuster_Lisa in Region B) who fail to gather all necessary documentation in a single pass.

The most impactful single intervention would be enforcing **comprehensive upfront document collection** for medium- and high-complexity claims, which could theoretically reduce a 77-hour case to under 30 hours by eliminating redundant request-wait cycles entirely.
