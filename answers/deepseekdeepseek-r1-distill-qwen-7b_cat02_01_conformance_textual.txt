Okay, so I need to figure out which cases in the event log are deviating from the normative process described. Let me start by carefully reading through the normative description and the event log.

First, the normative process has two main paths based on inventory availability. If inventory is sufficient, the process goes: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close. If inventory is insufficient, it's: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close.

Looking at the event log, each case has a series of activities with timestamps. I'll go through each case one by one.

Case 1: 
- Receive at 9:00
- Check at 10:00
-Authorize at 11:00
- Package at 12:00
- Ship at 13:00
- Close at 14:00

This follows the correct sequence for sufficient inventory. No issues here.

Case 2:
- Receive at 9:00
- Check at 9:30
- Package at 10:00
-Authorize at 10:30
- Ship at 11:00
- Close at 11:30

Wait, the normative process says Authorize should come after Check, which is followed by Package, Ship, etc. But in this case, after Check, it jumps to Package, then Authorize. That's a violation because Authorize should only happen after Package. So this case is deviating.

Case 3:
- Receive at 9:00
- Check at 9:20
-Authorize at 9:40
- Cancel at 9:40? No, let me check: Check at 9:20, Authorize at 9:40, Cancel at 9:40? Wait, no, the timestamps are:

- 9:00: Receive
- 9:20: Check
- 9:40:Authorize
- 9:40: Cancel?

No, the Cancel is at 9:40, but according to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient, after Check, it should Cancel without Authorizing. So in this case, after Authorize, it cancels, which is a violation because you shouldn't Authorize before Canceling if inventory is insufficient.

Wait, actually, the order in the log is:

- After Check, Authorize, then Cancel.

But according to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient, after Check, it should Cancel, and then Close. So in this case, it's Authorizing before Canceling, which is incorrect.

Case 4:
- Receive at 9:00
- Check at 9:10
- Cancel at 9:20
- Close at 9:50

Here, after Check, it Cancel without Authorizing, which is correct if inventory is insufficient. So this seems okay. The process is Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. That's the correct sequence for insufficient inventory.

Case 5:
- Receive at 9:00
- Check at 10:00
-Authorize at 10:30
- Ship at 11:00
- Close at 11:30

This follows the sufficient inventory path: Receive, Check,Authorize,Ship,Close. No issues.

So, to summarize:

Case 2 violated the order by Authorizing before packaging.

Case 3 violated by Authorizing before Canceling, which is incorrect when inventory is insufficient.

Case 4 followed the correct insufficient inventory path.

Case 1 and 5 followed the correct sufficient inventory path.

I think that's all. Let me double-check the timestamps for any other possible violations.

Looking again at Case 3:

After Check, the activities are Authorize, Cancel, Close.

But according to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient, after Check, you should Cancel and then Close, without Authorizing. So having Authorize before Cancel is wrong.

Similarly, in Case 2, after Check, it went to Package, then Authorize, which is wrong because Authorize should come after Package.

So yes, these two cases are the ones violating the normative process.

The normative process describes two main paths for handling orders based on inventory availability. The expected sequence is as follows:

1. **Sufficient Inventory Path**:
   - Receive order
   - Check inventory
   - Authorize payment
   - Package items
   - Ship order
   - Close order

2. **Insufficient Inventory Path**:
   - Receive order
   - Check inventory
   - Cancel order
   - Close order

**Analysis of Event Log Cases**:

- **Case 1**: Follows the sufficient inventory path correctly.
  
- **Case 2**: Violates the process by placing "Authorize payment" before "Package items". The correct order should be "Authorize payment" after "Package items".

- **Case 3**: Violates the process by "Authorizing payment" before "Canceling order". When inventory is insufficient, "Cancel order" should immediately follow "Check inventory".

- **Case 4**: Follows the insufficient inventory path correctly.

- **Case 5**: Follows the sufficient inventory path correctly.

**Conclusion**:

Cases 2 and 3 deviate from the normative process. Case 2 incorrectly places "Authorize payment" before "Package items", and Case 3 incorrectly places "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" when inventory is insufficient.
