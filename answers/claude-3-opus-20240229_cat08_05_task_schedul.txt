I'll provide a comprehensive analysis and solution framework for Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling challenges, structured according to the requested points.

1. **ANALYZING HISTORICAL SCHEDULING PERFORMANCE AND DYNAMICS**

A. Process Discovery and Flow Analysis
- Apply process mining algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner) to reconstruct the actual process model from event logs, revealing:
  * Frequent job routing patterns
  * Deviations from planned routes
  * Parallel processing opportunities
  * Critical path identification

B. Performance Metrics Extraction
1. Flow and Lead Times:
- Calculate distribution of:
  * Total job completion time (first to last event)
  * Value-added time (sum of actual processing)
  * Non-value-added time (waiting, setup)
- Use dotted chart analysis to visualize job progression patterns

2. Queue Time Analysis:
- For each work center:
  * Extract queue entry/exit timestamps
  * Calculate queue length distributions over time
  * Identify peak congestion periods
  * Correlate with upstream/downstream events
