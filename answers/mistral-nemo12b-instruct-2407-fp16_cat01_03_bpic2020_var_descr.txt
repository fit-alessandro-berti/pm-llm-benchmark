Based on the provided process variants, here's a description of the underlying process:

**Process Name:** Declaration and Payment Process

**Actors:**
- Employee
- Administration (Admin)
- Budget Owner
- Pre-Approver
- Supervisor
- Missing (unknown role)

**States/Activities:**
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
   - The process begins when an employee submits a declaration.

2. **Declaration APPROVED/REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION/PRE_APPROVER/SUPERVISOR/BUDGET OWNER/MISSING**
   - The submitted declaration is reviewed and either approved or rejected by the respective role.
   - If approved, it moves to the next step. If rejected, it can go back to the employee for resubmission or follow different paths based on the rejector's role.

3. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
   - Once all necessary approvals are obtained, the declaration is marked as final approved by the supervisor.

4. **Request Payment**
   - After final approval, a request for payment is initiated.

5. **Payment Handled**
   - The payment process is completed successfully.

**Process Variants:**
The data shows various process variants based on different approval/rejection paths:

- **Direct Paths:** Some declarations are approved directly by the administration and then the supervisor (with or without budget owner involvement), followed by payment.
  - Frequency: 4618, 2473, 1392, 575
  - Performance: 810187.903, 1084338.407, 854633.975, 861058.409

- **Rejection and Resubmission Paths:** Some declarations are rejected at various stages (admin, pre-approver, supervisor, budget owner, or missing) and sent back to the employee for resubmission.
  - Frequency: 345, 188, 174, 77, 57, 49, 40, 36, 31, 29, 22, 21, 18, 14, 11, 10, 8 (multiple times), 6 (multiple times), 5
  - Performance: 1604595.638, 2061236.516, 727139.517, 1728631.623, 1519728.789, 1685420.041, 1947246.400, 2542497.917, 713794.452, 2790977.310, 1227602.318, 872310.667, 653277.889, 1005677.500, 2544294.364, 2054847.800, 1377215.500, 295700.250, 71336.875, 4922455.714, 2936133.833, 2006332.000, 1482400.000, 13805869.200, 2249318.200

- **Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions:** Some declarations go through multiple rejections and resubmissions before being final approved.
  - Frequency: 36, 29, 22, 14, 11, 10, 8 (multiple times), 6 (multiple times), 5
  - Performance: 2542497.917, 2790977.310, 1227602.318, 1005677.500, 2544294.364, 2054847.800, 1377215.500, 295700.250, 71336.875, 4922455.714, 2936133.833, 2006332.000, 1482400.000, 13805869.200, 2249318.200

- **Direct Payment Paths (after final approval):** Some declarations are approved directly and proceed to payment without any rejections.
  - Frequency: 4
  - Performance: 9110508.000, 3502608.250, 1530125.750

**Performance Metric:** The performance metric seems to be a cost or amount associated with each process variant.

In summary, the underlying process involves declaration submission, approval/rejection by different roles, final approval, payment request, and payment handling. There are multiple variants of this process based on different approval/rejection paths and resubmissions.
