Here’s a concise DuckDB query that returns **all events belonging to cases with six or fewer events**:

```sql
-- Option 1: using a subquery with GROUP BY / HAVING
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

**Alternative (windowfunction) version**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS case_cnt
    FROM event_log
) AS t
WHERE case_cnt <= 6;
```

Both statements:

1. Compute the number of rows (events) per `case_id`.
2. Keep only those `case_id`s whose total count is 6.
3. Return every row (event) that belongs to the retained cases.

You can add an `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` clause if you want the result sorted chronologically per case.
