The process underlying this data appears to be a business workflow for processing and approving tax declarations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. An employee submits a tax declaration (SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. The declaration is reviewed by an administration level user (ADMINISTRATION) who then forwards it for approval via PRE_APPROVER.
3. If the PRE_APPROVER approves, the declaration moves to SUPERVISOR level approval.
4. The SUPERVISOR reviews and finalizes the approval of the tax declaration.
5. Once finalized, the declaration is sent for payment processing, which involves:
	* Payment being approved by the supervisor or missing (in cases where payment request is rejected).
	* Payment handled by a specific workflow step if available and the flow has the option to send it to this node
6. If the tax declaration is rejected at any level, it can be sent back to one of several nodes for further processing:
	* To SUPERVISOR again.
	* Rejected by EMPLOYEE themselves.
	* Rejected by a BUDGET OWNER.
	* Rejected by PRE_APPROVER.
7. If the tax declaration is approved, but rejected at the level responsible for final approval (missing payment):
   - It may then be submitted again to an Employee
   or forwarded for rejection by SUPERVISOR
