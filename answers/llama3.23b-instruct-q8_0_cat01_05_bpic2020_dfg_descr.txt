Based on the provided data, it appears to be a workflow or business process involving multiple steps and stakeholders in an organization. Here's a breakdown of the process:

**Overview**

The process involves various declarations submitted by employees, which are then reviewed and approved/approved by different levels of management, including supervisors, administration, budget owners, and pre-approvers.

**Process Steps**

1. **Declaration Submission**: An employee submits a declaration (e.g., payment request or approval) to the system.
2. **Initial Review**: The submitted declaration is initially reviewed by an administrator (e.g., Administrator) who checks its validity and accuracy.
3. **Approval/Rejection**: Based on the review, the administrator decides whether to approve or reject the declaration.
4. **Pre-Approver Review**:
	* If approved, the declaration is forwarded to a pre-approver (e.g., PRE_APPROVER).
	* The pre-approver reviews and approves/rejects the declaration.
5. **Supervisor Review**:
	* If approved by the pre-approver, the declaration is forwarded to a supervisor (e.g., SUPERVISOR).
	* The supervisor reviews and approves/finalizes the declaration.
6. **Budget Owner Review**:
	* If approved by the supervisor, the declaration is forwarded to a budget owner (e.g., BUDGET_OWNER).
	* The budget owner reviews and approves/rejects the declaration.
7. **Final Approval**:
	* If approved by the budget owner, the declaration is finalized as FINAL_APPROVED.
8. **Payment Processing**:
	* Once declared FINAL_APPROVED, a request for payment is sent to a Payment Handler (e.g., PAYMENT_HANDLED).
9. **Payment Handling**:
	* The Payment Handler processes the payment and handles any related activities.

**Error Paths**

The process also includes error paths where declarations are rejected at various stages:

1. Rejected by Administrator
2. Rejected by Pre-Approver
3. Rejected by Supervisor (in some cases)
4. Rejected by Budget Owner (in some cases)

These error paths result in the declaration being resubmitted or returned to the employee for re-submission.

**Special Cases**

The data also includes special cases where:

1. A declaration is rejected and then resubmitted.
2. A declaration is approved but not finalized due to errors (e.g., missing data).
3. A declaration is finally approved, but then rejected again due to an error.

This process appears to involve a complex series of approvals, reviews, and rejections, with various stakeholders involved in ensuring the accuracy and validity of the declarations.
