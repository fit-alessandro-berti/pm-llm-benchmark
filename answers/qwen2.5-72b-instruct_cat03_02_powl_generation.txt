### Explanation:
1. **Initial Step (SR -> CS)**:
   - The `initial_step` is a `StrictPartialOrder` that contains the `Service Request (SR)` and `Contract Setup (CS)`. The order is defined such that `CS` can only start after `SR` is completed.

2. **Initial Configuration (DA, ACI)**:
   - The `initial_configuration` is a `StrictPartialOrder` that contains `Datacenter Allocation (DA)` and `Access Control Initialization (ACI)`. These tasks can be performed concurrently, so no order is defined between them.

3. **Looped Configuration (BNC -> D&R)**:
   - The `loop` is an `OperatorPOWL` with the `LOOP` operator, containing `Base Network Configuration (BNC)` and `Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)`. This loop continues until the configuration is stable.

4. **Exclusive Choice (CD or MD)**:
   - The `xor` is an `OperatorPOWL` with the `XOR` operator, containing `Containerized Deployment (CD)` and `Monolithic Deployment (MD)`. Only one of these deployments will be chosen.

5. **Final Steps (QA, SA, GLA)**:
   - The `final_steps` is a `StrictPartialOrder` that contains `Quality Assurance (QA)`, `Security Audit (SA)`, and `Go-Live Approval (GLA)`. `QA` and `SA` can be performed concurrently, but both must be completed before `GLA` can start.

6. **Combining All Steps**:
   - The `root` is the main `StrictPartialOrder` that combines all the steps in the correct order: `initial_step` -> `initial_configuration` -> `loop` -> `xor` -> `final_steps`.

This Python code constructs the described complex digital service provisioning process as a POWL model, ensuring all the dependencies and concurrent tasks are accurately represented.
