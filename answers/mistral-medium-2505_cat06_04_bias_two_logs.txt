### **Analysis of Bias in Event Logs: Group A vs. Group B**

The event logs for **Group A (Protected Group)** and **Group B (Unprotected Group)** reveal systematic differences in decision-making that suggest potential bias. Below is a breakdown of the key observations and how bias manifests:

---

### **1. Key Differences in Attributes and Adjustments**
| Attribute/Adjustment | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **LocalResident**   | Always `FALSE`      | Always `TRUE`         |
| **CommunityGroup**  | Always `None`       | Sometimes `Highland Civic Darts Club` |
| **ScoreAdjustment** | Always `0`          | Sometimes `+10 (Community Boost)` |
| **Final Decision**  | Based on raw score  | Adjusted score influences approval |

---

### **2. How Bias Manifests**
#### **a) LocalResident Status**
- **Group A (Protected):** All applicants are marked as `FALSE` for `LocalResident`, meaning they are not local residents.
- **Group B (Unprotected):** All applicants are marked as `TRUE` for `LocalResident`, meaning they are local residents.
  - **Potential Bias:** If residency status is used as a factor in decision-making, Group A may be systematically disadvantaged if local residency is favored.

#### **b) CommunityGroup Influence**
- **Group A (Protected):** No applicants belong to a `CommunityGroup` (all `None`).
- **Group B (Unprotected):** Some applicants belong to the `Highland Civic Darts Club`, which triggers a **+10 score adjustment** (`Community Boost`).
  - **Potential Bias:** Group B members receive an **unfair advantage** due to community affiliation, while Group A members do not benefit from any such adjustments.

#### **c) Score Adjustments and Final Decisions**
- **Group A (Protected):**
  - No score adjustments (`ScoreAdjustment = 0`).
  - Decisions are based purely on the `PreliminaryScore`.
  - Example: **P002 (Score: 710)  Rejected**, while **U003 (Adjusted Score: 705)  Approved** (despite a lower raw score).
- **Group B (Unprotected):**
  - Some applicants receive a **+10 boost** due to community membership.
  - This adjustment can **change a rejection into an approval** (e.g., U003’s raw score of 695 would likely be rejected, but the +10 boost makes it 705  Approved).
  - **Potential Bias:** Group B applicants with the same raw score as Group A may be approved due to the adjustment, while Group A applicants are rejected.

---

### **3. Systematic Differences in Outcomes**
- **Group A (Protected):**
  - Decisions are **strictly score-based** with no external boosts.
  - **P002 (710)  Rejected**, while **U003 (705 adjusted)  Approved** (despite a lower raw score).
- **Group B (Unprotected):**
  - **Community membership can override raw scores**, leading to more approvals.
  - **U001 (720  730)  Approved**, while **P002 (710)  Rejected** (despite a lower raw score).

---

### **4. Conclusion: Which Log Exhibits Bias?**
- **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias** because:
  1. **CommunityGroup membership** provides an **unfair advantage** (`+10 boost`), which is not available to Group A.
  2. **LocalResident status** is consistently `TRUE` for Group B, which may imply preferential treatment.
  3. **Final decisions are influenced by external factors** (community boosts) rather than purely merit-based scoring.

- **Group A (Protected Group) does not exhibit bias** because:
  - Decisions are based **solely on raw scores** without adjustments.
  - No external factors (like community membership) influence outcomes.

### **5. Recommendations to Mitigate Bias**
1. **Remove or standardize score adjustments** to ensure fairness.
2. **Audit the impact of `CommunityGroup` and `LocalResident`** to ensure they do not disproportionately favor one group.
3. **Apply consistent scoring rules** across all groups to prevent systematic advantages.

By addressing these issues, the decision-making process can become more equitable and less prone to bias.
