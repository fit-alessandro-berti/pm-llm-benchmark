**Comprehensive Process Mining–Based Approach to Optimize Patient Flow in a Multi-Specialty Outpatient Clinic**

---

### **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

**Defining Waiting Time:**  
In this context, *waiting time* (or queue time) is the duration between the **completion of one activity** and the **start of the next activity** in a patient’s care pathway. For example, if a patient completes registration at 09:08:45 and begins the nurse assessment at 09:15:20, the waiting time is 6 minutes and 35 seconds. This reflects idle time during which the patient is ready for the next step but is delayed due to resource unavailability, scheduling misalignment, or process inefficiencies.

**Methodology for Calculation:**  
Using the event log:
- Group events by **Case ID** (Visit ID).
- Sort events chronologically by timestamp.
- For each pair of consecutive activities (e.g., Registration  Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation), compute:  
  `Waiting Time = Start Time of Next Activity – Completion Time of Previous Activity`  
  If negative (e.g., due to data errors or overlapping), treat as zero.
- Aggregate waiting times across all visits for each inter-activity transition.

**Key Queue Metrics to Calculate:**
- **Average & Median Waiting Time**: Central tendency indicators; median is robust to outliers.
- **90th Percentile Waiting Time**: Captures experience of high-wait patients (critical for satisfaction).
- **Maximum Waiting Time**: Highlights worst-case scenarios.
- **Queue Frequency**: % of visits experiencing any wait > 0 between two activities.
- **Excessive Wait Incidence**: % of visits with waiting time exceeding a clinically acceptable threshold (e.g., >15 minutes between nurse and doctor).
- **Patient-Segmented Metrics**: Stratify by *Patient Type* (New vs. Follow-up) and *Urgency* (Normal vs. Urgent) to uncover disparities.

**Identifying Critical Queues:**  
Prioritize queues using a **multi-criteria scoring system**:
1. **Impact**: High average or 90th percentile wait time.
2. **Volume**: High frequency (e.g., occurs in >80% of visits).
3. **Vulnerability**: Disproportionately affects high-priority groups (e.g., urgent or new patients).
4. **Downstream Effect**: Delays that cascade (e.g., long waits before doctor consultation delay diagnostics and checkout).

*Example*: If the queue between *Nurse Assessment* and *Doctor Consultation* has a 90th percentile wait of 45 minutes and affects 95% of new patients, it is a top-priority bottleneck.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis**

Beyond identifying *where* queues occur, process mining enables deep root cause diagnosis:

**Potential Root Causes:**
- **Resource Bottlenecks**: Limited doctors, exam rooms, or diagnostic equipment (e.g., only one ECG machine).
- **Poor Resource Scheduling**: Doctors double-booked or not aligned with patient inflow.
- **High Variability in Service Times**: Some consultations take 10 minutes, others 40—creating unpredictable downstream waits.
- **Inefficient Handovers**: Lack of real-time visibility when a patient is ready for the next step.
- **Appointment Scheduling Mismatch**: Fixed 15-minute slots for variable-length visits cause accumulation.
- **Arrival Clustering**: Patients arrive in waves (e.g., mornings), overwhelming capacity.
- **Patient Heterogeneity**: New patients require longer registration/nursing, but are scheduled like follow-ups.

**Process Mining Techniques for Diagnosis:**
- **Resource Utilization Analysis**:  
  Calculate utilization rates per resource (e.g., Dr. Smith is booked 95% of the time; Room 3 is idle 40%). High utilization (>85%) often correlates with queuing.
  
- **Bottleneck Analysis via Cycle & Wait Time Correlation**:  
  Use tools like *bottleneck heatmap* to show which resources consistently have long queues before their activity.

- **Variant Analysis**:  
  Cluster patient pathways into common variants (e.g., “New + Cardio + ECG” vs. “Follow-up + Dermatology”). Compare waiting times across variants to isolate problematic flows.

- **Throughput Time Decomposition**:  
  Break total visit duration into *processing time* (activity duration) vs. *waiting time*. If waiting constitutes >60% of total time, process redesign is needed.

- **Arrival vs. Capacity Alignment**:  
  Plot patient arrival rates (by hour) against staff/resource availability to detect mismatches (e.g., 20 patients arrive at 9 AM, but only 2 doctors are on duty).

These analyses reveal whether delays stem from *capacity*, *coordination*, or *variability*—guiding targeted interventions.

### **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Real-Time Demand**  
- **Target Queue**: Between Nurse Assessment and Doctor Consultation (especially for high-volume specialties like Cardiology).  
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Static doctor schedules misaligned with actual patient inflow and case complexity.  
- **Data Support**: Variant analysis shows Cardiology new patients have 30-min avg wait; resource logs show doctors idle early but overwhelmed post-10 AM.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Use predictive models (from historical logs) to forecast hourly demand by specialty/patient type.  
  - Implement a flexible daily schedule where doctors float between specialties or adjust session lengths based on morning inflow.  
  - Introduce a “buffer doctor” for overflow during peak hours.  
- **Expected Impact**: Reduce 90th percentile wait by 35–50% (e.g., from 45 to 25 minutes) without adding full-time staff.

**Strategy 2: Redesign Patient Flow via Parallel Processing**  
- **Target Queue**: Between Doctor Consultation and Diagnostic Tests (e.g., ECG, Blood Draw).  
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Sequential workflow forces patients to wait for test scheduling after consultation, even if test resources are free.  
- **Data Support**: Logs show ECG rooms are underutilized in mornings while patients wait post-consultation in afternoons.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Enable *pre-consultation diagnostics* for routine tests (e.g., ECG for known cardiac patients) based on triage.  
  - Introduce a “diagnostic hub” where nurses can order standard tests immediately after assessment if criteria are met.  
  - Use digital alerts to notify test techs when a patient is en route.  
- **Expected Impact**: Eliminate 15–20 minutes of average post-consultation wait; reduce total visit duration by 12–18%.

**Strategy 3: Smart Appointment Scheduling with Duration Intelligence**  
- **Target Queue**: Registration-to-Nurse and overall front-desk congestion.  
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Uniform appointment slots ignore variability in patient type (New vs. Follow-up) and service time.  
- **Data Support**: Analysis shows new patients take 2.5× longer in registration and nursing than follow-ups, yet both are given same slot length.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Replace fixed slots with *data-driven time blocks*: e.g., 20 min for new patients, 10 min for follow-ups.  
  - Stagger arrivals (e.g., every 8–12 minutes instead of on the hour) to smooth demand.  
  - Reserve “urgent slots” dynamically based on real-time no-shows or cancellations.  
- **Expected Impact**: Reduce registration-to-nurse wait by 40%; decrease front-desk queue length by 50%.

### **4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints**

**Trade-offs to Anticipate:**
- **Bottleneck Shifting**: Reducing doctor wait times may increase pressure on diagnostics if ECG capacity isn’t scaled. *Mitigation*: Monitor all queues post-implementation via real-time dashboards.
- **Staff Workload**: Dynamic scheduling may increase cognitive load for schedulers or doctors. *Mitigation*: Use decision-support tools to automate slot recommendations.
- **Care Quality Risk**: Parallel diagnostics could lead to unnecessary tests. *Mitigation*: Embed clinical decision rules (e.g., only order ECG if cardiac history) into workflow logic.
- **Cost Constraints**: Avoid hiring; instead, optimize existing capacity. Floating doctors or cross-training nurses may require minimal training investment but yield high ROI.

**Balancing Objectives:**  
- Use **multi-objective optimization**: Set targets like “reduce 90th percentile wait by 30% without increasing staff FTEs or reducing consultation time below clinical minimums.”  
- Prioritize **high-impact, low-cost** changes first (e.g., scheduling logic over facility expansion).  
- Engage clinicians in design to ensure changes support—not hinder—care quality.

### **5. Measuring Success**

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
1. **Average & 90th Percentile Waiting Time** per critical queue (e.g., Nurse  Doctor).
2. **Total Visit Duration** (door-to-door time).
3. **Patient Satisfaction Scores** (e.g., % rating wait time as “acceptable”).
4. **Resource Utilization Rate** (target: 70–85% to avoid both underuse and burnout).
5. **On-Time Start Rate** for doctor consultations (measures scheduling accuracy).

**Ongoing Monitoring Approach:**
- **Continuous Event Log Ingestion**: Automate daily ingestion of event logs into a process mining platform (e.g., Celonis, Disco, or open-source PM4Py).
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Display live KPIs for managers, with alerts for queues exceeding thresholds.
- **A/B Testing**: Pilot changes in one specialty (e.g., Cardiology) vs. control (e.g., Dermatology) to isolate impact.
- **Feedback Loops**: Monthly reviews comparing pre- and post-implementation metrics; adjust strategies based on emerging variants or new bottlenecks.

By embedding process mining into operational governance, the clinic can sustain improvements and foster a culture of data-driven, patient-centered care.
