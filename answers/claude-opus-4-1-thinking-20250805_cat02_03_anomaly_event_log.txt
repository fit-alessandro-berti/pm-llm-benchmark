## Analysis of P2P Process Anomalies

After analyzing the event log, I've identified significant anomalies in **Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004**. Case 1001 follows the standard P2P process flow correctly.

### **Case 1001:  Normal Process**
This case follows the standard P2P sequence properly:
Requisition  Approval  PO  Goods Receipt  Invoice  Matching  Payment  Close

### **Case 1002:  Multiple Critical Violations**

**Anomalies identified:**
1. **Purchase Order issued before requisition approval** (PO at 08:40, Approval at 08:00 next day)
2. **Payment released before goods receipt** (Payment on Feb 3, Goods on Feb 4)
3. **Payment released before invoice matching** (Payment at 07:15, Matching on Feb 5)
4. **Requisition approved AFTER payment was made**

**Why problematic:**
- **Compliance violation**: Bypassing approval controls exposes the organization to unauthorized spending
- **Fraud risk**: Paying before receiving goods creates opportunity for fictitious purchases
- **Financial control breakdown**: No verification that goods/services match what was ordered before payment
- **Audit failure**: Violates segregation of duties and approval hierarchies

### **Case 1003:  Premature Payment**

**Anomalies identified:**
1. **Payment released before goods receipt** (Payment Feb 8, Goods Feb 10)
2. **Payment released before invoice receipt** (Payment Feb 8, Invoice Feb 9)
3. **Three-way matching performed after payment**

**Why problematic:**
- **Cash flow risk**: Paying for goods not yet received or verified
- **No recourse**: Difficult to recover funds if goods are never delivered or are non-conforming
- **Accounting issues**: Payment without proper documentation violates accrual accounting principles

### **Case 1004:  Goods Before Purchase Order**

**Anomalies identified:**
1. **Goods received before Purchase Order issued** (Goods at 09:00, PO at 09:15)

**Why problematic:**
- **Contractual risk**: No formal agreement in place when goods were received
- **Price uncertainty**: Terms and conditions not established before receipt
- **Maverick buying**: Indicates potential circumvention of procurement policies
- **Legal liability**: Accepting goods without a PO may create implied contracts with unfavorable terms

## Summary of Key Risks

These anomalies indicate serious control weaknesses that could lead to:
- **Financial losses** through fraud or error
- **Regulatory non-compliance** 
- **Inability to dispute incorrect charges**
- **Weak vendor management**
- **Poor budget control**

**Recommendation**: Implement system controls to enforce proper sequencing of P2P activities and investigate these cases for potential policy violations or system configuration issues.
