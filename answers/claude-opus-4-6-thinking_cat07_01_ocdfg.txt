# Description of the Visualization

## Overview
This is an **Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) flowchart** that depicts multiple interrelated business processes across procurement, sales, and order management. It visualizes how different object types flow through various process activities.

## Object Types (Top Row)
The diagram tracks **five distinct object types**, each represented by different colors:

| Object Type | Volume | Color |
|---|---|---|
| **PurchaseRequisitionItem** | 2.0M objects | Purple |
| **SalesOrderItem** | 3.5M objects | Orange |
| **PurchaseOrderItem** | 5.0M objects | Blue |
| **VendorInvoiceItem** | 1.2M objects | Green |
| **ReturnOrderItem** | 0.8M objects | Red/Pink |

## Key Process Activities
The diagram includes several major process steps, each showing an **overall volume**:

1. **Create Requisition** (3.0M)  **Approve Requisition** (5.7M)
2. **Create Order** (8.5M)  **Pack Goods** (2.0M)  **Ship Goods** (1.8M)  **Confirm Delivery** (1.7M)
3. **Send Order** (5.2M), **Check Stock** (1.0M), **Process Return** (0.8M)
4. **Approve Payment** (1.5M)  **Create Invoice** (2.0M)
5. **Close Order** (1.7M)

## Flow Characteristics
- **Transition times** are annotated on edges (e.g., 300ms, 450ms, 600ms)
- Multiple **Start** and **End** nodes indicate parallel process streams
- Colored paths show how different object types traverse shared and unique activities
- **Convergence points** (like Approve Requisition) show where multiple object types interact
- **Feedback loops** exist (e.g., between Check Stock and Approve Requisition)

## Insights
- The process is **highly interconnected**, with objects from different types sharing activities
- **Approve Requisition** is a major hub with 5.7M overall interactions
- The right side represents a **fulfillment chain** (Create Order  Pack  Ship  Confirm  Close)
- The left side focuses on **procurement and invoicing**
- Return processing feeds back into the approval cycle
