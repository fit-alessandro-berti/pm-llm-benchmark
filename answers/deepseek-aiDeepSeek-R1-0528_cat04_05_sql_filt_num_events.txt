We are going to use a common approach: 
 1. First, compute the number of events per case_id.
 2. Then, filter the case_ids that have more than six events (we will exclude these).
 3. Finally, select all events from the event_log that belong to the case_ids that have six or fewer events.

 We can achieve this by using a subquery that counts the events per case and then filters the cases. Then we join back to the original table to get the events.

 Alternatively, we can use a window function to avoid a join? But note: we want to filter entire cases. 

 Another option: use a CTE (Common Table Expression) or a subquery to compute the counts and then use that to filter.

 Let me write using a subquery in the FROM clause to get the case_ids that we want, and then join to the event_log.

 However, note: we can also use the `HAVING` clause if we group by case_id? But we want to return individual events, not aggregates.

 So, step-by-step:

 Option 1 (using a subquery and then a join):
   Step 1: Create a subquery that groups by case_id and counts the events, then filters to only include case_ids with count <= 6.
   Step 2: Join this subquery back to the original event_log on case_id to get all the events for these cases.

 Option 2 (using a window function): 
   We can compute the count per case_id for every row (using a window function) and then filter the rows where the count for the case is <= 6.

 But note: the window function approach will compute the same count for every row in the same case, and then we can filter by that count. This avoids a join and might be efficient.

 Let me write both and then choose.

 However, the prompt does not specify performance or size, so we can choose either. I'll go with the window function because it avoids a join and is straightforward.

 Using window function:

   SELECT *
   FROM (
     SELECT 
        *,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS case_event_count
     FROM event_log
   ) 
   WHERE case_event_count <= 6;

 But note: this will compute the count for every row and then filter. It's efficient because DuckDB can optimize window functions.

 Alternatively, we can use a CTE and then join:

   WITH case_counts AS (
     SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as event_count
     FROM event_log
     GROUP BY case_id
     HAVING event_count <= 6
   )
   SELECT e.*
   FROM event_log e
   JOIN case_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id;

 Both methods are valid. The window function method might be slower if the table is very large because it computes the count for every row? But DuckDB is columnar and might optimize the window function with a partition by.

 However, note: the window function method will scan the entire table and then compute the window. The group by method also scans the entire table but then does a join. 

 Since the problem does not specify the size, I'll choose the window function for simplicity.

 But wait: what if there are duplicate rows? The count in the window function counts each row. That is correct because each row is an event.

 However, the problem says "each row representing a single event", so duplicates are not an issue? Actually, duplicates in events might exist? But the problem does not specify. We are counting events per case, so if there are duplicate events, they are separate events? The problem says "each row representing a single event", so each row is one event.

 So, both methods are correct.

 However, the window function method might be less efficient for large data because it has to compute the count for every row? But then again, the group by method also has to do a full scan and then a join. 

 Let me check: DuckDB might be able to push the filter condition on the window function. But I'm not sure.

 Alternatively, we can use the `IN` operator:

   SELECT *
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (
     SELECT case_id
     FROM event_log
     GROUP BY case_id
     HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
   );

 This is also a valid method and might be efficient because DuckDB can optimize the IN with a semi-join.

 I think the IN method is clear and efficient.

 Let me write that:

   SELECT *
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (
     SELECT case_id
     FROM event_log
     GROUP BY case_id
     HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
   );

 This will return all events for cases that have six or fewer events.

 We can also use EXISTS, but IN is straightforward.

 However, note: what if there are NULL case_ids? The problem does not specify, but typically case_id should not be null. We assume non-null.

 So, I'll go with the IN method.

 But let me compare:

   Window function: 
      Pros: one pass, but might materialize a large intermediate result?
      Cons: if the table is huge, the window function might use more memory?

   IN with subquery:
      The subquery is aggregated and then we do a semi-join. DuckDB might use a hash aggregate and then a hash join, which is efficient.

 Since the problem does not specify the size, and we are filtering out many cases (only keeping cases with <=6 events), the subquery will be small. So the IN method might be better.

 But note: the subquery returns only the case_ids that meet the condition, and then we do a semi-join. This should be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can use a CTE for the subquery to make it more readable.

 However, the query is short enough.

 Final decision: use the IN method.

 But wait: what if we have a case with 0 events? That's impossible because the event_log has events. So every case_id in the event_log has at least one event.

 So, we are safe.

 Let me write the query accordingly.

To solve this problem, you need to filter out cases with more than six events and return all events from cases with six or fewer events. Here's the DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes this efficiently:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Subquery for Case Filtering**:
   - The inner query (`SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`) calculates the number of events per `case_id`.
   - The `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` clause ensures only `case_id`s with **six or fewer events** are retained.

2. **Main Query**:
   - The outer query selects all columns (`SELECT *`) from the `event_log`.
   - The `WHERE case_id IN (...)` clause filters events to include **only those cases** identified by the subquery.

### Key Features:
- **Efficiency**: Uses a single pass over the data for grouping and a semi-join for filtering.
- **Clarity**: Clearly separates the logic for identifying qualifying cases and retrieving their events.
- **Correctness**: Handles all edge cases (e.g., cases with 1–6 events are included; cases with >6 events are excluded).

This query ensures you get all event details for cases meeting the event-count requirement without unnecessary complexity.
