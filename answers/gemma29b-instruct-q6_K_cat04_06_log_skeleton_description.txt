The data represents a workflow process, likely for expense reimbursement or a similar approval process. 

Here's a breakdown based on the provided information:

**Process Stages:**

* **Employee Initiates:** The process starts with an "Employee" submitting a request, represented by "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".
* **Supervisor Review:** The request then moves to a "Supervisor" for review and approval ("Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR").
* **Pre-Approver Review:** Next, a "Pre-Approver" (potentially someone in finance or a department head) reviews the request ("Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER").
* **Administration Review:** The request goes to "Administration" for final approval ("Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION").
* **Budget Owner Approval:**  There's a stage for a "Budget Owner" to approve the request, indicating budgetary considerations ("Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER").

**Possible Rejection Points:**

* At each stage, the request can be rejected:
    * "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR"
    * "Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER"
    * "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION"
    * "Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER"
    * "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" (This might indicate an incomplete form or missing information)
    * "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" (Perhaps the employee made a change and needs to resubmit)

* **Final Approval:**  Once all approvals are granted, the process reaches "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR".
* **Payment:**  After final approval, "Payment Handled" likely signifies the release of funds.

**"Request Payment"** seems to be a trigger point, initiating the entire approval workflow.
