Certainly! Below is a Python dictionary representing a temporal profile for a subset of activity pairs in the global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics. I've estimated the average times and standard deviations based on the typical durations and variabilities associated with these activities.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (14400, 7200),       # Average: 4 hours, StdDev: 2 hours
    ('OP', 'RC'): (518400, 86400),     # Average: 6 days, StdDev: 1 day
    ('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 1800),        # Average: 2 hours, StdDev: 0.5 hours
    ('QI', 'CA'): (10800, 3600),        # Average: 3 hours, StdDev: 1 hour
    ('CA', 'PT'): (18000, 3600),       # Average: 5 hours, StdDev: 1 hour
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 1800),        # Average: 2 hours, StdDev: 0.5 hours
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 900),          # Average: 1 hour, StdDev: 0.25 hours
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 43200),     # Average: 2 days, StdDev: 0.5 days
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800),   # Average: 30 days, StdDev: 7 days

    # Cross-step pairs
    ('SS', 'RC'): (532800, 86400),     # Average: 6.25 days, StdDev: 1 day (SS to RC considering OP)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (583200, 86400),     # Average: 6.8 days, StdDev: 1 day (OP to CA considering RC and QI)
    ('RC', 'PT'): (34560, 8640),       # Average: 9.6 hours, StdDev: 2.4 hours (RC to PT considering QI and CA)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (25200, 3600),       # Average: 7 hours, StdDev: 1 hour (QI to PK considering CA and PT)
    ('CA', 'WS'): (10800, 3600),       # Average: 3 hours, StdDev: 1 hour (CA to WS considering PT and PK)
    ('PT', 'DT'): (176400, 43200),     # Average: 2 days, StdDev: 0.5 days (PT to DT considering PK and WS)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (2620800, 604800),   # Average: 30.5 days, StdDev: 7 days (PK to AS considering WS and DT)
    ('SS', 'PT'): (626400, 86400),     # Average: 7.3 days, StdDev: 1 day (SS to PT considering OP, RC, QI, CA)
    ('OP', 'WS'): (633600, 86400),     # Average: 7.4 days, StdDev: 1 day (OP to WS considering RC, QI, CA, PT, PK)
}

# The values are in seconds

This dictionary includes both directly connected and cross-step activity pairs. The average times and standard deviations are estimated based on typical delays and variabilities associated with each step in the supply chain process.
