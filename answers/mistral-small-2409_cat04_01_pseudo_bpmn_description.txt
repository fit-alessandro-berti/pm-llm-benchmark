The pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a business process for handling customer requests, which can be either standard or custom. Let's break down each step, the gateways, and the overall flow of the process:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Start Event**
   - The process begins when a customer request is received.

2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
   - This is the initial task where the customer's request is received and logged into the system.

3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**
   - This gateway evaluates whether the request is standard or custom.
   - **Standard Path:** If the request is standard, the process follows the tasks for standard validation.
   - **Custom Path:** If the request is custom, the process follows the tasks for custom feasibility analysis.

4. **[Standard Path] Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
   - Validates the standard customer request against predefined criteria.

5. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
   - This gateway splits the process into two parallel paths:
     - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**
       - Checks the creditworthiness of the customer.
     - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
       - Checks whether the required inventory is available.

6. **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
   - The process waits for both parallel checks to complete before proceeding.

7. **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
   - Calculates and sets the delivery date based on the results of the checks.

8. **[Custom Path] Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
   - Evaluates whether the custom request is feasible.

9. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
   - This gateway decides the next step based on the feasibility analysis:
     - **If Yes:** Proceeds to prepare a custom quotation.
     - **If No:** Sends a rejection notice to the customer and ends the process.

10. **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
    - Prepares a quotation for the custom request.

11. **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
    - Sends a rejection notice to the customer if the customization is not feasible.

12. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
    - This gateway determines if manager approval is required before proceeding.
    - **If Yes:** The process follows the approval path.
    - **If No:** The process skips the approval step and proceeds directly to invoice generation.

13. **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
    - Obtains approval from a manager.

14. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
    - This gateway checks if the manager has granted the approval:
      - **If Yes:** Proceeds to generate the final invoice.
      - **If No:** Triggers a re-evaluation of the conditions.

15. **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
    - Generates the final invoice for the customer.

16. **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
    - Re-evaluates the conditions if the approval is not granted.

17. **Loop Back**
    - If conditions need to be re-evaluated, the process loops back to the task where the custom quotation is prepared (Task E1 for custom path) or the delivery date is calculated (Task D for standard path).

18. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
    - Sends a confirmation to the customer after the final invoice is generated.

19. **End Event**
    - The process ends after the confirmation is sent to the customer.

### Key Differences Based on Request Type

- **Standard Request:**
  - Follows a straightforward path with standard validation (Task B1), parallel checks (Tasks C1 and C2), and delivery date calculation (Task D).
  - Approval might not be needed, allowing direct invoice generation.

- **Custom Request:**
  - Involves a feasibility analysis (Task B2) and conditional paths based on feasibility.
  - Requires more steps, including custom quotation preparation and potential rejections.
  - More likely to need manager approval before proceeding.

### Conditions for Approvals and Rework

- **Approvals:** Required if the process reaches the "Is Approval Needed?" gateway. This is typically more common in the custom path.
- **Rework:** Triggered if manager approval is not granted, leading to a re-evaluation of conditions and potentially looping back to earlier tasks (Task E1 or Task D).

Overall, this process ensures that customer requests are thoroughly vetted and appropriately handled, with clear paths for both standard and custom requests, and built-in mechanisms for approvals and rework as needed.
