Below is the integrated event log produced by combining and structuring data from the provided tables. Each event is a row associated with a case (the order_id), representing steps like order creation, item picking, dispatch, arrival, invoice issuing, and payment reception.

**Assumptions:**
- The primary process instance (the **Case ID**) is the `order_id`.
- Each significant step in the order lifecycle generates an event (as logically defined above).
- Resources/Actors are included where available.
- Events are chronologically ordered for each case.

###  **Notes:**  
- Order **1004** has picking but no recorded deliveries, invoices, or payments yet.
- Orders with multiple deliveries/invoices/payments (*e.g., order 1002*) have multiple corresponding events.
- "Additional Attributes" provide richer context about each event, useful for enhanced process analysis.
- The event log meticulously captures how resources (human/system actors) contribute at each stage along with timestamps, fulfilling essential criteria for effective process mining analysis.
