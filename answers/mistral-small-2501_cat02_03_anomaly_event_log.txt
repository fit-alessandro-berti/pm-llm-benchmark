To identify anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process, we need to compare the sequences of activities in each case against the standard P2P process flow. The typical sequence of activities in a P2P process is as follows:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Issue Purchase Order**
4. **Receive Goods**
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**
7. **Release Payment**
8. **Close Case**

Let's analyze each case to identify any unusual or anomalous sequences:

### Case 1001
1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Issue Purchase Order**
4. **Receive Goods**
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**
7. **Release Payment**
8. **Close Case**

**Anomalies:** None.

### Case 1002
1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Issue Purchase Order**
3. **Vendor Invoice Received**
4. **Release Payment**
5. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
6. **Receive Goods**
7. **Match Invoice to PO**
8. **Close Case**

**Anomalies:**
- The **Approve Purchase Requisition** activity is performed after the **Issue Purchase Order** activity. This is problematic because the purchase order should typically be issued only after the requisition is approved.
- The **Vendor Invoice Received** and **Release Payment** activities occur before the **Receive Goods** activity. This is unusual and problematic because typically, goods should be received before an invoice is processed and payment is made.

### Case 1003
1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Issue Purchase Order**
4. **Release Payment**
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**
6. **Receive Goods**
7. **Match Invoice to PO**
8. **Close Case**

**Anomalies:**
- The **Release Payment** activity occurs before the **Vendor Invoice Received** and **Receive Goods** activities. This is problematic because payment should typically be made after the goods are received and the invoice is matched to the purchase order.

### Case 1004
1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Receive Goods**
4. **Issue Purchase Order**
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**
7. **Release Payment**
8. **Close Case**

**Anomalies:**
- The **Receive Goods** activity occurs before the **Issue Purchase Order** activity. This is problematic because goods should typically be received after the purchase order is issued to the vendor.

### Summary of Anomalies and Their Potential Problems:

1. **Case 1002:**
   - **Issue Purchase Order** before **Approve Purchase Requisition:** This can lead to unauthorized or improper purchases.
   - **Vendor Invoice Received** and **Release Payment** before **Receive Goods:** This can result in payments being made for goods that have not been received, leading to potential fraud or errors in inventory management.

2. **Case 1003:**
   - **Release Payment** before **Vendor Invoice Received** and **Receive Goods:** This can result in payments being made without verifying the receipt of goods or the validity of the invoice, increasing the risk of fraud and financial losses.

3. **Case 1004:**
   - **Receive Goods** before **Issue Purchase Order:** This can lead to discrepancies in inventory records and financial reporting, as goods are being received without a corresponding purchase order.

These anomalies highlight potential issues in the P2P process that could lead to fraud, financial losses, and operational inefficiencies. Addressing these anomalies would involve reviewing the process flow, ensuring compliance with standard procedures, and implementing controls to prevent such deviations.
