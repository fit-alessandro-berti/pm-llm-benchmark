### 1. Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

The following anomalies have been identified in the temporal profile model:

- **(R, P):** The average time from **Receive** to **Approve** is approximately 1.04 days (90,000 seconds), with a **very low standard deviation of 3,600 seconds (1 hour)**. This suggests a rigid, possibly enforced or automated approval window that lacks variability, which is unusual in most real-world insurance claim handling.

- **(P, N):** The average time from **Approve** to **Notify** is **7 days (604,800 seconds)** with a **high standard deviation of 172,800 seconds (2 days)**. This indicates a significant and inconsistent delay in customer notification after approval, which could reflect operational bottlenecks or poor prioritization.

- **(A, C):** The average time from **Assign** to **Close** is **2 hours (7,200 seconds)** with a standard deviation of 1 hour. This is unusually fast and may suggest that claims are being **closed prematurely**, potentially before being fully evaluated or approved.

- **(E, N):** The average time from **Evaluate** to **Notify** is **5 minutes (300 seconds)** with a very low standard deviation of 60 seconds. This extremely short interval may indicate that **notifications are being sent too quickly**, possibly without sufficient review or that **intermediate steps are being skipped**.

### 2. Hypotheses for Anomalies

#### (R, P): Low Variability in Approval Timing
- **Hypothesis 1:** An automated approval system is enforcing a fixed schedule or time limit for approvals.
- **Hypothesis 2:** Claims are being manually fast-tracked or batch-approved at fixed intervals, such as at the end of a business day.
- **Hypothesis 3:** The model is skewed by a subset of claims (e.g., very simple or low-value claims) that are approved quickly and dominate the average.

#### (P, N): Long and Variable Delay in Notification
- **Hypothesis 1:** Notifications are being manually sent by adjusters who are overburdened or lack access to automated tools.
- **Hypothesis 2:** There is a backlog in the notification stage, possibly due to a lack of dedicated resources or a system bottleneck.
- **Hypothesis 3:** Some claims are being approved but not followed up on, possibly due to oversight or system failure.

#### (A, C): Premature Closure
- **Hypothesis 1:** Adjusters are closing claims before completing all required steps, possibly due to pressure to reduce workload or meet KPIs.
- **Hypothesis 2:** The system allows for invalid closures (e.g., a bug in the workflow logic).
- **Hypothesis 3:** Certain claim types or regions are being closed improperly or too quickly due to policy misapplication.

#### (E, N): Too Rapid Notification
- **Hypothesis 1:** Notifications are being auto-generated immediately after evaluation, without waiting for approval or final review.
- **Hypothesis 2:** The evaluation process is being recorded as completed, but in reality, it is not fully conducted before notification.
- **Hypothesis 3:** The system is mislogging the timeline, and the notification may actually occur after approval, but the timestamps are incorrectly recorded.

### 3. SQL Verification Queries

#### A. Identify Claims with Anomalous Time Intervals

**Query: Claims with unusually fast approval (R to P)**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END) AS receive_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) - 
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS time_to_approve
FROM 
    claim_events e
JOIN 
    claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE 
    e.activity IN ('R', 'P')
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id
HAVING 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) - 
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END))) < 82800
    OR 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) - 
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END))) > 97200;
```

> This query identifies claims where the time from **Receive** to **Approve** is outside the expected range (±2 hours from 25 hours average).

---

**Query: Claims with unusually long approval to notification delay (P to N)**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) - 
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS time_to_notify
FROM 
    claim_events e
JOIN 
    claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE 
    e.activity IN ('P', 'N')
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id
HAVING 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) - 
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END))) > 777600
    OR 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) - 
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END))) < 540000;
```

> This identifies claims where the **Approve to Notify** time is outside the expected range (7 days ± 2 days).

---

**Query: Claims closed immediately after assignment (A to C)**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END) AS assign_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) - 
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS time_to_close
FROM 
    claim_events e
JOIN 
    claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE 
    e.activity IN ('A', 'C')
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id
HAVING 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) - 
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END))) < 10800;
```

> This identifies claims closed **within 3 hours** of assignment, which may suggest **premature closure**.

---

**Query: Claims with rapid evaluation to notification (E to N)**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN e.timestamp END) AS evaluate_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) - 
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS time_to_notify
FROM 
    claim_events e
JOIN 
    claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE 
    e.activity IN ('E', 'N')
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id
HAVING 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) - 
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN e.timestamp END))) < 360;
```

> This identifies claims where **notification occurs within 6 minutes** of evaluation, which may indicate **skipped steps** or **auto-notification**.

#### B. Correlation with Adjusters and Claim Types

**Query: Anomalous claim timing by adjuster**
```sql
SELECT 
    e.resource,
    COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
    AVG(CASE 
        WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e.timestamp - prev_event_time))
        ELSE NULL 
    END) AS avg_time_to_approve,
    STDDEV(CASE 
        WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e.timestamp - prev_event_time))
        ELSE NULL 
    END) AS stdev_time_to_approve
FROM (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_event_time,
        LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
        resource
    FROM 
        claim_events
) e
WHERE 
    prev_activity = 'R' AND activity = 'P'
GROUP BY 
    e.resource
ORDER BY 
    avg_time_to_approve;
```

> This query identifies **adjusters** or **resources** who are associated with **abnormally fast or slow approval times**, potentially pointing to **individual performance issues** or **systematic problems** in certain workflows.

---

**Query: Anomalous claim timing by claim type**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
    AVG(CASE 
        WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e.timestamp - prev_event_time))
        ELSE NULL 
    END) AS avg_time_to_approve,
    STDDEV(CASE 
        WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e.timestamp - prev_event_time))
        ELSE NULL 
    END) AS stdev_time_to_approve
FROM (
    SELECT 
        e.claim_id,
        e.activity,
        e.timestamp,
        LAG(e.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY e.claim_id ORDER BY e.timestamp) AS prev_event_time,
        LAG(e.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY e.claim_id ORDER BY e.timestamp) AS prev_activity,
        c.claim_type
    FROM 
        claim_events e
    JOIN 
        claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
) sub
WHERE 
    prev_activity = 'R' AND activity = 'P'
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_type
ORDER BY 
    avg_time_to_approve;
```

> This query helps **identify claim types** that show **abnormal approval patterns**, which may indicate **specific process issues** in certain insurance lines.
