To construct a temporal profile for the given global supply chain process, we need to estimate the average time and standard deviation for various pairs of activities that eventually follow each other in the process. These estimates will be based on logical reasoning about the nature of the activities and their dependencies.

Here is the Python dictionary representing the temporal profile:

```python

### Explanation:
1. **Activity Dependencies**: The delays between activities are estimated based on logical dependencies. For example, `Supplier Selection (SS)` must occur before `Order Placement (OP)`, and there is typically a delay of about one day between these steps.
2. **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation reflects variability in the process due to factors like supplier lead times, testing thoroughness, or distribution network efficiency.
3. **Complexity**: Pairs of activities separated by multiple steps (e.g., `SS → AS`) have larger average delays and higher variability compared to directly connected activities (e.g., `PT → PK`).

This dictionary provides a representative subset of activity pairs, capturing both direct and indirect dependencies in the supply chain process.
