## 1. Cases that take **significantly longer** to finish  

First we compute the total lead‑time for each case (difference between the first *Submit Claim* event and the final *Close Claim* event).

| Case ID | First timestamp | Last timestamp | Lead‑time (days h m) |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **2001** | 2024‑04‑01 09:00 | 2024‑04‑01 10:30 | \(0\text{ d }1\text{ h }30\text{ m}\) |
| **2002** | 2024‑04‑01 09:05 | 2024‑04‑02 11:00 | \(1\text{ d }1\text{ h }55\text{ m}\) |
| **2003** | 2024‑04‑01 09:10 | 2024‑04‑03 09:30 | \(2\text{ d }0\text{ h }20\text{ m}\) |
| **2004** | 2024‑04‑01 09:20 | 2024‑04‑01 10:45 | \(0\text{ d }1\text{ h }25\text{ m}\) |
| **2005** | 2024‑04‑01 09:25 | 2024‑04‑04 14:30 | \(3\text{ d }5\text{ h }5\text{ m}\) |

### What counts as “significantly longer”?

* The majority of cases (2001, 2004) finish within **≈ 1.5 h**.  
* Case 2002 needs **≈ 26 h** – already an order of magnitude higher.  
* Cases 2003 and 2005 exceed **48 h** (2 days + ) and **77 h** (3 days +), respectively.  

Hence the **problematic cases** are **2002, 2003, 2005**.

## 2. Attribute‑level analysis  

### 2.1 Complexity  

| Complexity | Cases (lead‑time) | Avg. lead‑time |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Low  | 2001 (1 h 30 m), 2004 (1 h 25 m) | \( \approx 1\text{ h }27\text{ m} \) |
| Medium | 2002 (26 h) | \( \approx 26\text{ h} \) |
| High | 2003 (48 h 20 m), 2005 (77 h 5 m) | \( \approx 62\text{ h} \) |

**Observation:** Lead‑time grows with the *Complexity* level.  
*Medium* cases are ~20 × longer than *Low* cases, while *High* cases are ~3 × longer than *Medium* cases.

### 2.2 Number of “Request Additional Documents” events  

| Case | Complexity | # Requests | Time between first request & approval |
|------|------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| 2001 | Low | 0 | – |
| 2002 | Medium | 1 | 2024‑04‑01 14:00 → 2024‑04‑02 10:00 = **20 h** |
| 2003 | High | 2 | 2024‑04‑01 11:00 → 2024‑04‑02 16:00 = **29 h** (first request) <br> 2024‑04‑01 17:00 → 2024‑04‑02 16:00 = **23 h** (second request) |
| 2005 | High | 3 | 2024‑04‑01 11:30 → 2024‑04‑04 10:00 = **70 h** (first request) <br> 2024‑04‑02 17:00 → 2024‑04‑04 10:00 = **41 h** (second) <br> 2024‑04‑03 15:00 → 2024‑04‑04 10:00 = **19 h** (third) |

**Observation:**  
* Each additional “request” adds a **large waiting window** (≈ 20 – 70 h).  
* High‑complexity cases tend to have **multiple** requests, compounding the delay.

### 2.3 Region  

| Region | Cases (lead‑time) | Avg. lead‑time |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| A | 2001 (1 h 30 m), 2003 (48 h 20 m) | \( \approx 24\text{ h }55\text{ m} \) |
| B | 2002 (26 h), 2004 (1 h 25 m), 2005 (77 h 5 m) | \( \approx 34\text{ h }10\text{ m} \) |

The **average** for Region B is higher, but the spread is driven by the presence of both a very fast (2004) and a very slow (2005) case. No clear systematic regional effect emerges once we control for *Complexity*.

### 2.4 Resource  

| Resource | Cases (lead‑time) | Avg. lead‑time |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| CSR_Jane / CSR_Paul / CSR_Mary (front‑office) | 2001 (1 h 30 m), 2004 (1 h 25 m), 2002 (26 h), 2005 (77 h) | \( \approx 26\text{ h } \) |
| Adjuster_Mike | 2001 (1 h 30 m), 2003 (48 h 20 m) | \( \approx 24\text{ h }55\text{ m} \) |
| Adjuster_Lisa | 2002 (26 h), 2004 (1 h 25 m), 2005 (77 h) | \( \approx 34\text{ h } \) |
| Manager_Ann | 2001, 2002, 2004 (all ≤ 1 h 30 m) | \( \approx 1\text{ h }35\text{ m} \) |
| Manager_Bill | 2003 (48 h 20 m), 2005 (77 h 5 m) | \( \approx 62\text{ h} \) |
| Finance_Alan / Finance_Carl | All fast (≤ 1 h 30 m) | – |

**Observation:**  
* The **manager** who signs off the claim appears to be a strong differentiator.  
  * *Manager Ann* handles low‑ and medium‑complexity cases and finishes within an hour.  
  * *Manager Bill* is involved only in high‑complexity cases and the lead‑time jumps to days.  

* The **adjuster** does not show a clear pattern; both Adjuster Mike and Adjuster Lisa work on fast and slow cases, but the slowness aligns with the number of document‑request cycles rather than the individual adjuster.

## 3. Interpretation & Recommendations  

### 3.1 Root‑cause summary  

| Root cause | Evidence from the log |
|------------|-----------------------|
| **Claim complexity** | Lead‑time rises from ~1 h (Low) → 26 h (Medium) → >48 h (High). |
| **Multiple “Request Additional Documents” cycles** | Each extra request adds ~20‑70 h of waiting time; high‑complexity cases have 2‑3 requests. |
| **Manager responsible for approval** | Cases approved by *Manager Bill* (high‑complexity) are the longest; *Manager Ann* (low/medium) finishes quickly. |
| **Region** | No consistent pattern after controlling for complexity; region alone is not a primary driver. |
| **Specific resources (adjusters)** | No clear correlation; the same adjuster can be fast or slow depending on claim complexity. |

### 3.2 Why these attributes cause delays  

| Attribute | Why it can create a bottleneck |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Complexity** | High‑complexity claims often need more evidence, specialist reviews, and cross‑departmental validation, naturally extending the process. |
| **Document‑request loops** | Each loop requires the claimant to gather and resend information, and the adjuster to re‑evaluate. If the claimant’s response time is long (e.g., waiting until the next business day), the overall lead‑time inflates dramatically. |
| **Manager Bill vs. Manager Ann** | *Manager Bill* may be a senior manager with a heavier workload or stricter validation rules for high‑risk claims, causing longer approval times. |
| **Region** | Although not decisive here, different regional offices may have varying SLAs, staffing levels, or local regulations that could become a factor in larger datasets. |
| **Resource workload** | Adjusters handling many high‑complexity cases simultaneously could experience queueing, but the current sample is too small to confirm. |

### 3.3 Actionable mitigation strategies  

| Strategy | Targeted root cause | Practical steps |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Standardise document‑request handling** | Multiple request loops | 1. Introduce a **single‑request checklist** that captures all required documents up‑front (e.g., via a dynamic web‑form). <br>2. Use **automated reminders** (email/SMS) to claimants with a 24‑h response deadline. <br>3. Allow **parallel processing** – while waiting for documents, start preliminary checks that do not depend on missing items. |
| **Complexity‑aware routing** | Claim complexity | 1. At *Submit Claim* stage, auto‑classify complexity using rule‑based or ML scoring. <br>2. Route **high‑complexity** cases to a **dedicated fast‑track team** (e.g., a senior adjuster + specialist manager) to avoid queuing with low‑complexity work. |
| **Approval‑process optimisation** | Manager‑ delay | 1. Empower **Manager Ann** (or equivalent) with limited‑risk authority to approve certain high‑complexity claims after a predefined checklist, reducing reliance on *Manager Bill*. <br>2. Implement **SLA dashboards** for managers, highlighting pending approvals > 4 h. |
| **Resource load balancing** | Potential adjuster overload | 1. Monitor **adjuster work‑in‑progress** counts; rebalance when an adjuster exceeds a threshold (e.g., > 5 active high‑complexity cases). <br>2. Cross‑train adjusters to handle both medium and high complexity, providing backup capacity. |
| **Region‑level capacity planning** | Possible hidden regional effects | 1. Collect **regional workload metrics** (cases per day, average staffing). <br>2. If a region consistently shows higher lead‑times, consider **staff augmentation** or **process harmonisation** (e.g., sharing best‑practice templates). |
| **Analytics & continuous monitoring** | All root causes | 1. Build a **process‑mining dashboard** that visualises average cycle times per attribute (Complexity, Resource, Region). <br>2. Set **alert thresholds** (e.g., any case > 48 h triggers a case‑review). <br>3. Conduct **monthly root‑cause reviews** to validate whether interventions are effective. |

### 3.4 Quick‑win implementation plan (first 3 months)

| Month | Activity | Owner | Success metric |
|-------|----------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Deploy a **single‑request checklist** in the claim‑submission portal; add automated reminder workflow. | Product & IT | Reduction of “Request Additional Documents” events per case from 2.0 → ≤ 0.5 (pilot). |
| 1‑2 | Define **complexity scoring rules** and configure routing to a **high‑complexity fast‑track team**. | Business Analyst & Operations | Average lead‑time for high‑complexity cases drops from 62 h → ≤ 30 h. |
| 2 | Grant **limited approval authority** to Manager Ann for high‑complexity claims meeting checklist criteria. | Governance Committee | Approval‑step duration for high‑complexity cases falls from > 20 h → ≤ 4 h. |
| 2‑3 | Implement **adjuster workload dashboard** and set re‑balancing rules. | Operations Manager | No adjuster exceeds 5 concurrent high‑complexity cases; queue‑time per adjuster ≤ 2 h. |
| 3 | Launch **process‑mining KPI dashboard** (lead‑time by attribute, SLA compliance). | Data Science Team | Real‑time alerts generated for any case > 48 h; 90 % of alerts resolved within 8 h. |

## 4. Take‑away  

- **Complexity** and the **number of document‑request cycles** are the primary drivers of the long durations observed in cases 2002, 2003, 2005.  
- The **approval manager** (Bill vs. Ann) further amplifies the delay for high‑complexity claims.  
- **Region** and **adjuster** identity do not show a systematic impact in this small sample, but they should be monitored as the dataset grows.  

By **standardising upfront information capture**, **routing high‑complexity work to a specialised team**, and **empowering a faster approval path**, the organization can cut the average lead‑time for problematic cases from several days to **under 24 h**, delivering a markedly better customer experience and lower operational cost.
