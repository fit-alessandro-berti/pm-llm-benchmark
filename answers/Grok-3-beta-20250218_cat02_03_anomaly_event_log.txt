Let’s analyze the event log for the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process and identify anomalies by comparing the sequence of activities in each case against the standard P2P process flow. The typical P2P process follows this sequence:
Create Purchase Requisition – Request for goods/services is initiated.
Approve Purchase Requisition – Requisition is reviewed and authorized.
Issue Purchase Order (PO) – Formal order is sent to the vendor.
Receive Goods – Goods are delivered by the vendor.
Vendor Invoice Received – Invoice is sent by the vendor.
Match Invoice to PO – Invoice is verified against the PO and goods receipt.
Release Payment – Payment is made to the vendor.
Close Case – Process instance is completed.
Deviations from this sequence can indicate inefficiencies, errors, or potential fraud. Let’s examine each case:
Case 1001
Sequence: Create Purchase Requisition → Approve Purchase Requisition → Issue Purchase Order → Receive Goods → Vendor Invoice Received → Match Invoice to PO → Release Payment → Close Case
Analysis: This case follows the standard P2P process flow perfectly. All steps occur in the expected order, with reasonable time progression.
Anomaly: None identified.
Case 1002
Sequence: Create Purchase Requisition → Issue Purchase Order → Vendor Invoice Received → Release Payment → Approve Purchase Requisition → Receive Goods → Match Invoice to PO → Close Case
Analysis: Several anomalies are present:
Issue Purchase Order before Approve Purchase Requisition: The PO is issued (2024-02-01 08:40) before the requisition is approved (2024-02-03 08:00). In a standard P2P process, approval of the requisition is required before a PO can be issued to ensure proper authorization.
Release Payment before Receive Goods and Match Invoice to PO: Payment is released (2024-02-03 07:15) before goods are received (2024-02-04 09:00) and before the invoice is matched to the PO (2024-02-05 08:00). Typically, payment should only be released after goods are received and the invoice is verified against the PO and receipt to confirm accuracy and delivery.
Why Problematic:
Issuing a PO without approval bypasses internal controls, risking unauthorized purchases.
Paying before goods are received and invoices are matched increases the risk of overpayment, payment for undelivered goods, or fraud (e.g., paying a fake invoice). This also disrupts cash flow management and audit trails.
Case 1003
Sequence: Create Purchase Requisition → Approve Purchase Requisition → Issue Purchase Order → Release Payment → Vendor Invoice Received → Receive Goods → Match Invoice to PO → Close Case
Analysis: Significant anomalies include:
Release Payment before Vendor Invoice Received and Receive Goods: Payment is released (2024-02-08 11:00) before the invoice is received (2024-02-09 12:00) and goods are delivered (2024-02-10 13:00). In a standard P2P process, payment occurs after goods receipt and invoice verification.
Match Invoice to PO after Payment: Invoice matching (2024-02-11 14:00) happens after payment, which is illogical since matching should confirm payment legitimacy.
Why Problematic:
Paying without an invoice or goods receipt is a major control violation, risking payment for non-existent goods or services (potential fraud).
Matching the invoice after payment defeats the purpose of verification, as funds are already disbursed without ensuring accuracy or delivery. This could lead to financial loss or disputes with the vendor.
Case 1004
Sequence: Create Purchase Requisition → Approve Purchase Requisition → Receive Goods → Issue Purchase Order → Vendor Invoice Received → Match Invoice to PO → Release Payment → Close Case
Analysis: One key anomaly:
Receive Goods before Issue Purchase Order: Goods are received (2024-02-06 09:00) before the PO is issued (2024-02-06 09:15). In a standard P2P process, a PO must be issued to the vendor first to initiate the delivery of goods.
Why Problematic:
Receiving goods before issuing a PO suggests a lack of formal agreement with the vendor, which could lead to disputes over pricing, quantities, or terms. It also bypasses procurement controls, potentially resulting in untracked or unauthorized purchases. This could complicate inventory management and financial reconciliation.
Summary of Anomalies and Their Implications
Case ID
Anomaly
Potential Issues
1002
PO issued before requisition approval; Payment before goods received/invoice matched
Unauthorized purchases, risk of fraud, overpayment, or payment for undelivered goods
1003
Payment before invoice received and goods delivered; Matching after payment
Fraud risk, financial loss, inability to verify delivery or invoice accuracy before funds are spent
1004
Goods received before PO issued
Lack of formal vendor agreement, untracked purchases, disputes over terms, inventory mismanagement
Conclusion
Case 1001 aligns with standard P2P practices, while Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 exhibit anomalies that deviate from best practices. These deviations could indicate process inefficiencies, weak internal controls, or intentional circumvention (e.g., fraud). Businesses should investigate these cases further—e.g., checking for manual overrides, vendor collusion, or system errors—and strengthen controls like mandatory requisition approval before PO issuance and payment holds until invoice matching is complete.
