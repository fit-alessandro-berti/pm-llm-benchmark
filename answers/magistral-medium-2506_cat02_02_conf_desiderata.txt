### **Part 1: Normative Process Violations**

#### **Case 1:**
- **Compliance:** This case follows the normative rules perfectly. The sequence is correct:
  1. Application Received
  2. Credit Check (before Risk Assessment)
  3. Risk Assessment (before Loan Decision)
  4. Loan Decision (Approved)
  5. Inform Applicant (after Loan Decision)
  6. Finalize Documentation (since loan was approved)
  7. Close Case

No normative violations are present.

#### **Case 2:**
- **Violations:**
  1. **Out-of-order execution:** The sequence starts with "Application Received," but the next step is "Risk Assessment," which violates the rule that **Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment**.
  2. **Incorrect post-rejection action:** After the loan was rejected, the process still executed "Finalize Documentation," which is explicitly forbidden for rejected loans.

**Conclusion:** Case 2 violates normative rules in two ways:
  - Incorrect activity order (Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
  - Unnecessary and invalid "Finalize Documentation" after rejection.

#### **Case 3:**
- **Compliance:** This case follows the normative sequence correctly:
  1. Application Received
  2. Credit Check (followed by Risk Assessment)
  3. Risk Assessment (before Loan Decision)
  4. Loan Decision (Approved)
  5. Inform Applicant (after Loan Decision)
  6. Finalize Documentation (since loan was approved)
  7. Close Case

No normative violations are present, but there are **desiderata violations** (discussed below).

### **Part 2: Desiderata Violations**

Desiderata are recommended but not strictly enforced. Violations here indicate suboptimal but not incorrect behavior.

#### **Case 1:**
- **No violations:** All activities happen within reasonable timeframes.
  - Credit Check within 30 minutes of application.
  - Applicant informed within 2 hours of decision.

#### **Case 2:**
- **Normative violations already identified**, but we also observe:
  - The follow-up call is missing (though this is a desideratum, not a strict rule).
  - However, since normative rules are violated, desiderata are secondary.

#### **Case 3:**
- **Violations:**
  1. **Delayed Credit Check:**
     - Application received on 2024-01-12, but Credit Check done on 2024-01-14 (more than 24 hours later).
     - **Desideratum Violation:** Credit check should ideally happen within 24 hours.
  2. **Delayed Applicant Notification:**
     - Loan decision made on 2024-01-14 12:00, but applicant informed on 2024-01-16 15:00 (~51 hours later).
     - **Desideratum Violation:** Applicant should ideally be informed within 48 hours.
  3. **Missing Follow-up Call:**
     - No follow-up call was logged before closing the case.
     - **Desideratum Violation:** A follow-up call is recommended but not mandatory.

**Conclusion:** Case 3 does not violate normative rules but fails to meet three desiderata conditions:
  - Slow credit check.
  - Delayed applicant notification.
  - Missing follow-up call.

### **Possible Interpretations/Justifications**

#### **Case 2 (Normative Violations):**
- **Possible Reason for Risk Assessment Before Credit Check:**
  - The system may have a bug where activities are logged incorrectly.
  - Alternatively, a human operator may have mistakenly performed Risk Assessment before realizing the Credit Check was missing (later corrected, but still a violation).

- **Reason for Finalize Documentation After Rejection:**
  - This could be a **process error** (e.g., an employee forgot to check the decision and followed the default path).
  - Alternatively, the log may contain an error (e.g., a mislabeled event).

#### **Case 3 (Desiderata Violations):**
- **Delayed Actions:**
  - High workload or staff shortages may have caused delays in credit checks and notifications.
  - The applicant may have taken longer to respond, delaying the process.
- **Missing Follow-up Call:**
  - The organization may have decided it was unnecessary (since it’s a desideratum).
  - Alternatively, it may have been performed but not logged.

### **Final Summary of Findings**

| Case ID | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Violations? | Notes |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| 1       |  No                 |  No                  | Fully compliant. |
| 2       |  Yes                | (Not relevant due to normative violations) | 1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check. <br> 2) Finalized docs after rejection. |
| 3       |  No                 |  Yes                | 1) Credit check delayed (>24h). <br> 2) Applicant notified late (>48h). <br> 3) No follow-up call. |

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- For Case 2: Fix the process to enforce the correct order and prevent invalid actions after rejection.
- For Case 3: Optimize workflows to meet time-based desiderata (e.g., automate reminders for credit checks and notifications).
- For all cases: Ensure follow-up calls are logged if performed, or consider making them mandatory if they improve customer satisfaction.
