Here is a **textual BPMN-like process model** of the **Invoice Approval Process**, derived from the five stakeholder interviews. This model includes **activities, sequence flows, gateways, roles, data objects, and exception handling**, as required.

##  **Invoice Approval Process – Textual BPMN Model**

---

###  **Roles Involved:**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**
- **Supplier** (External)

---

###  **Data Objects / Artifacts:**
- **Invoice (with or without PO)**
- **Purchase Order (PO)**
- **System Confirmation (from Purchasing)**
- **System Approval (from Manager)**
- **Supplier Communication (Email or Revised Invoice)**

---

##  **Process Flow**

### 1. **Start Event: Invoice Received**
- **Trigger:** Invoice received (typically via email).
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)

---

### 2. **Check for PO Number**
- **Activity:** Check if the invoice contains a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
- **Role:** Mary

####  **If PO exists:**
- **Next:** Log the invoice into the accounting system.
- **Data Object:** Invoice + PO

####  **If PO is missing:**
- **Next:** Escalate to Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
- **Activity:** Request PO or revised invoice from supplier.
- **Role:** Karen

---

### 3. **Forward Invoice for PO Matching**
- **Activity:** Forward the logged invoice to the Purchasing Department for matching.
- **Role:** Mary
- **Data Object:** Invoice + PO

---

### 4. **Purchasing Department PO Matching**
- **Activity:** Purchasing Officer (Dan) compares invoice with PO:
  - Quantities
  - Prices
  - Delivery charges
- **Role:** Dan

####  **If match confirmed:**
- **Next:** Send confirmation to Accounts Payable.
- **Data Object:** System Confirmation

####  **If discrepancy found:**
- **Next:** Hold invoice and escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
- **Role:** Dan  Mary  Rita

---

### 5. **Escalation to Supervisor (Rita) – Exception Handling**
- **Activity:** Supervisor investigates:
  - Missing PO
  - Discrepancies in pricing or quantity
  - Unmatched invoices (e.g., informal services)
- **Role:** Rita

####  **If resolved:**
- **Next:** Return invoice to normal flow (Purchasing confirmation, Manager approval, etc.)

####  **If unresolved:**
- **Next:** May reject or create retrospective PO with department head.

---

### 6. **Manager Approval Request**
- **Activity:** System sends automatic approval request to Department Manager (Carlos).
- **Trigger:** After PO match and Purchasing confirmation.
- **Role:** Carlos

####  **If approved:**
- **Next:** Schedule for payment.
- **Data Object:** System Approval

####  **If rejected or suspicious:**
- **Next:** Hold invoice and investigate.
- **Role:** Mary or Rita
- **May involve:** Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) for contract verification.

---

### 7. **Schedule for Payment**
- **Activity:** Invoice is added to the next scheduled payment run.
- **Role:** Mary or Accounts Payable Team
- **Output:** Payment processed.

---

##  **Exception Handling / Alternate Paths**

### 1. **Missing PO**
- **Path:** Invoice  Missing PO  Escalate to Karen  Request PO or revised invoice from supplier.
- **Role:** Karen

### 2. **PO Mismatch or Discrepancy**
- **Path:** Invoice  PO mismatch  Hold  Escalate to Rita  Resolve  Return to normal flow.

### 3. **Manager Rejects Invoice**
- **Path:** Invoice  Manager rejects  Hold  Investigate  Possibly re-approve or reject.

### 4. **Unmatched Invoice (No PO)**
- **Path:** Invoice  No PO found  Escalate to Rita  Investigate  May create retrospective PO or reject.

---

##  **Gateways / Decision Points**

| Gateway | Description | Outcomes |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **PO Exists?** | Does the invoice have a valid PO? |  Proceed with matching,  Escalate |
| **PO Matches Invoice?** | Does the invoice match the PO? |  Confirm,  Escalate |
| **Manager Approval?** | Does the manager approve the invoice? |  Schedule payment,  Hold for investigation |
| **Discrepancy Resolved?** | Can the discrepancy be resolved? |  Continue,  Reject or escalate to Rita |

---

##  **End Event: Payment Scheduled**
- **Outcome:** Invoice approved and added to the payment cycle.
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Team

---

##  **Notes on Ambiguity / Uncertainty**
- **Conflicting paths:** Some paths are implied (e.g., after manager approval, it "goes back to AP" – assumed to be scheduling).
- **Uncertainty in rework loops:** Not all rejections are clearly described (e.g., what happens after a manager rejects – re-investigation is assumed).
- **Escalation paths:** Some escalation triggers are ambiguous (e.g., when does Mary escalate to Rita? – assumed on unresolved discrepancies or missing POs).

---

##  **Summary of Process Flow in BPMN Terms**

```
[Start Event: Invoice Received]
   
[Check for PO Number] (Gateway)
   
     [Log Invoice in System]  [Forward to Purchasing]
   
[PO Matching by Purchasing] (Activity)
   
     [Send Confirmation to AP]  [Trigger Manager Approval]
   
     [Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)]  [Resolve Exception]
   
[Manager Approval Request] (Gateway)
   
     [Schedule Payment]
   
[End Event: Payment Scheduled]
   
     [Hold Invoice]  [Investigate]  (Loop back or Reject)
```
