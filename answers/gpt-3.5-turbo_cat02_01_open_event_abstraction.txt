Event abstraction can be effectively utilized to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs by grouping similar events together based on certain criteria, such as event type, time frame, or outcome. This can help simplify the process model and make it easier to understand and analyze.

One way to use event abstraction is to create high-level abstract events that represent a series of related low-level events. For example, instead of showing every individual event in a process model, the model can be simplified by grouping similar events together under a single abstract event. This can help reduce the complexity of the model and make it easier to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Another way to utilize event abstraction is to categorize events based on certain attributes, such as the department or system responsible for the event. This can help organize the process model and make it easier to track the flow of events through different parts of the system.

Overall, event abstraction can help improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs by simplifying the model, organizing related events, and highlighting important patterns and trends in the data. By effectively utilizing event abstraction, organizations can gain valuable insights from their event logs and make more informed decisions to optimize their processes.
