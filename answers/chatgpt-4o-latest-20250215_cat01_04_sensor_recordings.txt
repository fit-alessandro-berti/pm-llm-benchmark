### **Manufacturing Process Analysis & Activity Inference**  

#### **Step 1: Identifying Phases in the Data**  
We analyze patterns in sensor readings to detect changes indicative of different activities. Key observations:  

1. **Idle States** (Events #1-3, #13-15)  
   - Low temperature (20-21°C)  
   - No vibration (0 Hz)  
   - No material flow (0 units/s)  
   - Low energy consumption (~0.40-0.50 kWh)  
   - Interpretation: Machine is in standby or waiting for the next operation.  

2. **Cutting Metal** (Events #4-6)  
   - Sudden increase in temperature (from 21°C to 58°C)  
   - High vibration levels (30-38 Hz)  
   - Material flow present (5 units/s)  
   - Energy consumption rises (2.00-3.00 kWh)  
   - Interpretation: High vibration and material flow suggest a cutting process, likely where a tool is engaged with raw material.  

3. **Assembling Parts** (Events #7-8)  
   - Temperature stabilizes at 40°C  
   - Lower vibration (10 Hz)  
   - Moderate material flow (2 units/s)  
   - Tool position increases (15 mm)  
   - Energy consumption remains stable (2.00 kWh)  
   - Interpretation: The lower vibration and stable energy usage suggest an assembly process where components are aligned and fixed.  

4. **Welding** (Event #9)  
   - Sharp temperature spike (80°C)  
   - Highest vibration recorded (50 Hz)  
   - No material flow (0 units/s)  
   - Energy usage peaks (5.00 kWh)  
   - Interpretation: The high heat and vibration indicate a welding process, where metal pieces are fused together.  

5. **Quality Inspection** (Events #10-12)  
   - Temperature decreases (30°C → 25°C)  
   - Vibration is low (1-5 Hz)  
   - Minimal material flow (1 unit/s)  
   - Tool position adjusts slightly (15 → 20 mm)  
   - Energy usage drops (1.00-1.60 kWh)  
   - Interpretation: The stable, low-intensity activity suggests an inspection phase, where measurements are taken or minor adjustments are made.

### **Step 2: Assigning Activity Labels**  

| **Event Range** | **Assigned Activity**      | **Reasoning** |
|---------------|--------------------|------------|
| #1-3         | **Idle**            | No activity, no material flow, low energy usage. |
| #4-6         | **Cutting Metal**    | Increased vibration, material flow, rising temperature. |
| #7-8         | **Assembling Parts** | Moderate vibration, stable temperature, controlled material flow. |
| #9           | **Welding**          | High temperature, high vibration, peak energy usage. |
| #10-12       | **Quality Inspection** | Low vibration, slight tool movements, decreasing energy usage. |
| #13-15       | **Idle**            | Return to standby state, no material flow, low energy. |
