Based on the provided data, it appears that the process underlying this data involves the following steps:

1. **Employee submits a declaration**.
2. **Declaration is reviewed by different parties**:
    - Administration
    - Pre-approver (if applicable)
    - Budget owner (if applicable)
    - Supervisor
3. **Declaration may be rejected or approved**.
4. **Missing information may be requested**.
5. **Employee may resubmit the declaration with missing information filled in**.
6. **Final approval is given by the supervisor**.
7. **Request for payment is submitted**.
8. **Payment is handled**.

This process appears to be related to expense reports or other financial submissions. The data provides insights into the frequency and performance of different steps in the process, as well as the overall success rate of the process (percentage of declarations that are finally approved and paid).

Here are some additional observations based on the data:

* The process seems to be generally successful, with a high percentage of declarations being approved and paid.
* There are some variations in the performance of different steps, with the highest percentage of success rate for "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and the lowest for "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING".
* The data also provides insights into the reasons for rejection (missing information, incorrect information, etc.) and the actions taken to address these issues (resubmission of the declaration with missing information, etc.).

Overall, the data provides valuable insights into the process of expense report approval and payment, which could be used to identify areas for improvement and to optimize the efficiency of the process.
