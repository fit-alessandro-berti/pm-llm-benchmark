Analyzing the provided process variants, we can identify several potential root causes for performance issues in the process:

1. **Rejection and re-submission loops**: Many variants involve rejection and re-submission of the declaration. For example, `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` or `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`. These loops can significantly increase the overall processing time and contribute to performance issues.

2. **Multiple approval levels**: Some variants involve multiple approval levels, such as `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`. While this may be a necessary step in some cases, it can slow down the process when not necessary.

3. **Missing or incomplete information**: The presence of `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING` variants suggests that sometimes the declaration is approved without complete information, leading to rework and delays.

4. **High rejection rates for certain approvers**: For example, `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER` variants have a relatively high frequency and performance time, indicating that this approver may be a bottleneck in the process.

5. **Long processing times for certain steps**: Some steps, such as `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION` and `Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`, have very high performance times (13805869.200 and 2544294.364, respectively). These steps may be causing significant delays in the process.

6. **Inefficient routing**: Some variants involve complex routing, such as `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`. These complex routes can lead to longer processing times and increased likelihood of errors.

By addressing these specific issues, the process can be optimized to reduce performance issues and improve overall efficiency.
