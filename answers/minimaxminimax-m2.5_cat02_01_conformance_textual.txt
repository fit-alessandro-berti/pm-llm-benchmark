First, I need to understand the normative process from the description. The process always starts with "Receive order." After that, "Check inventory" must occur before any decisions about payment or fulfillment. So, the first two activities should always be "Receive order" followed by "Check inventory."

Now, there are two main scenarios:

1. If inventory is sufficient: The sequence should be Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.

2. If inventory is insufficient: The sequence should be Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.

Key constraints:

- "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging.

- "Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping.

- "Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.

- "Close order" should be the final activity in all scenarios.

Now, let's look at each case in the event log:

Case 1:

- Receive order

- Check inventory

- Authorize payment

- Package items

- Ship order

- Close order

This matches the expected flow for sufficient inventory: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. So, no violation here.

Case 2:

- Receive order

- Check inventory

- Package items

- Authorize payment

- Ship order

- Close order

Here, after "Check inventory," we have "Package items" before "Authorize payment." According to the constraints, "Authorize payment" should occur before "Package items" because payment authorization must be done before packaging. So, this is a violation. Specifically, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which violates the rule that packaging should only occur after authorization.

Case 3:

- Receive order

- Check inventory

- Authorize payment

- Cancel order

- Ship order

- Close order

In this case, after "Check inventory," we have "Authorize payment" and then "Cancel order." But according to the process, if inventory is insufficient, we should cancel immediately after checking inventory, without authorizing payment. Here, payment is authorized before cancellation. Also, after "Cancel order," we have "Ship order," which should not happen because shipping should never occur after cancellation. Moreover, the sequence should be Cancel order  Close order directly, but here we have Ship order before Close order, which is incorrect. So, multiple violations: authorizing payment before cancellation, and shipping after cancellation.

Case 4:

- Receive order

- Check inventory

- Cancel order

- Close order

This matches the expected flow for insufficient inventory: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. So, no violation here.

Case 5:

- Receive order

- Check inventory

- Authorize payment

- Ship order

- Close order

Here, after "Authorize payment," we have "Ship order," but there's no "Package items" activity. According to the constraints, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items." So, this is a violation because shipping happens without packaging. Also, the sequence should include packaging between authorization and shipping.

Now, to summarize:

- Case 1: No violation.

- Case 2: Violation – Package items before Authorize payment.

- Case 3: Violations – Authorize payment before Cancel order, and Ship order after Cancel order.

- Case 4: No violation.

- Case 5: Violation – Ship order without Package items.

I should explain each violation clearly, referencing the normative description.

For case 2, the constraint is: "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping." So, packaging before authorization is wrong.

For case 3, there are two issues. First, "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging. But in this case, after authorizing payment, we cancel the order, which implies that payment was authorized even when inventory might be insufficient? The description says if inventory is insufficient, after checking inventory, we should cancel directly. Authorizing payment when inventory is insufficient doesn't make sense. Also, "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation." Here, shipping after cancellation is violated.

For case 5, "Ship order should only occur after packaging." Without packaging, shipping is not allowed.

I think that covers all violations. Now, I need to present the answer.

Based on the normative process description, the expected flow is as follows:

- **For sufficient inventory**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
- **For insufficient inventory**: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.

Key constraints include:
- "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."
- "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
- "Ship order" must occur after "Package items" and never after a cancellation.
- "Close order" is the final activity in all cases.

### Violations Identified:

**Case 2:**
- **Violation**: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
- **Explanation**: According to the normative process, payment authorization must be completed before packaging items. Here, the order is packaged before authorizing payment, which violates the constraint that packaging should only occur after authorization.

**Case 3:**
- **Violation 1**: "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order."
- **Explanation**: When inventory is insufficient, the process should branch to cancellation immediately after checking inventory, without authorizing payment. Authorizing payment before cancellation is illogical and violates the process flow for insufficient inventory.
- **Violation 2**: "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
- **Explanation**: Shipping should never occur after a cancellation. Once an order is canceled, the process should proceed directly to "Close order," not ship the order. This violates the rule that shipping is only allowed after packaging and never after cancellation.

**Case 5:**
- **Violation**: "Ship order" occurs without "Package items."
- **Explanation**: The process requires that items be packaged before shipping. Here, the order is shipped directly after payment authorization, skipping the packaging step, which violates the constraint that shipping must follow packaging.

### Cases Without Violations:
- **Case 1**: Follows the expected sequence for sufficient inventory.
- **Case 4**: Follows the expected sequence for insufficient inventory.

In summary, Cases 2, 3, and 5 deviate from the normative process, while Cases 1 and 4 adhere to it.
