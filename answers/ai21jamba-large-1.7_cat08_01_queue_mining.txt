### 1. Queue Identification and Characterization

#### **Calculating Waiting Times**

Using the event log, waiting time (or queue time) between consecutive activities can be calculated as the time difference between the **COMPLETION** of the preceding activity and the **START** of the subsequent activity.

- **Example:** For activities "Registration"  "Nurse Assessment" for a patient:$Waiting Time = Nurse Assessment Start - Registration Completion$

#### **Key Metrics to Characterize Queues**

1. **Average Waiting Time** (e.g., by activity, by patient type).
2. **Median Waiting Time** (for outlier-robust insights).
3. **Maximum Waiting Time** to identify extreme cases.
4. **Percentile Metrics** (e.g., 90th percentile) to identify "excessive" waits.
5. **Queue Frequency**: Count of visits experiencing waiting times above a threshold (e.g., 15 minutes).
6. **Queue Impact by Patient Type or Urgency**:
	- Highlight differences in wait times between "New" and "Follow-up" patients or between "Urgent" and "Normal" cases.

#### **Identifying Critical Queues**

Criteria to prioritize queues for action:

1. **Highest Average Waiting Time** (bottlenecks causing delays).
2. **Highest 90th Percentile Waiting Time** (indicates severe cases beyond typical).
3. **Most Frequently Affected Patients**: Activities/resources with a high frequency of delays.
4. **Impact on Patient Outcomes**: Queues affecting "Urgent" cases or high-volume departments.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

#### **Potential Root Causes of Significant Queues**

1. **Resource Bottlenecks**:
	- Limited availability of staff (e.g., doctors, nurses) or equipment (e.g., ECG rooms).
	- Overloaded resources due to poor capacity planning.
2. **Dependence on Activity Scheduling**:
	- **Sequential Design**: Activities cannot start until the previous completes.
	- **Delays in Patient Flow**: Misaligned scheduling (e.g., multiple patients scheduled for the same resource simultaneously).
3. **Process Variability**:
	- Variability in service times (e.g., longer consultation time for complex cases).
	- Variability in patient arrival rates (unexpected surges).
4. **Appointment Overbooking**:
	- Scheduling policies leading to patient clustering.
5. **Urgency-Based Delays**:
	- Urgent cases disrupting standard patient flow.

#### **Using Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Analysis**

1. **Resource Utilization Analysis**:
Analyze resource workload (e.g., staff, rooms) to identify under- or overutilized resources.
2. **Variant Analysis**:
Identify process variants (e.g., New vs. Follow-up) with significantly different performance and find deviations.
3. **Control-Flow Analysis**:
Identify inefficiencies in process flow paths, such as delays in specific transitions.

### 3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

#### **Strategy 1: Optimize Resource Schedules**

- **Target Queue**: High average waiting time between **Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Tests**.
- **Root Cause**: Limited doctor or diagnostic equipment availability at peak times.
- **Proposed Action**: Adjust doctor/staff schedules to better align with patient peak volumes (e.g., morning surges).
- **Impact**: Expected 20% reduction in average waiting time by spreading resource capacity across demand peaks.

#### **Strategy 2: Implement Parallelization of Activities**

- **Target Queue**: High waiting times between **Registration  Nurse Assessment**.
- **Root Cause**: Sequential activity design causing patients to idle.
- **Proposed Action**: Introduce parallel activities (e.g., allow some patients to jump to Nurse Assessment before Registration is fully done).
- **Impact**: Expected 15% reduction in total visit duration by overlapping non-conflicting activities.

#### **Strategy 3: Revise Appointment Scheduling**

- **Target Queue**: Long waits for **Follow-up patients** (due to overbooking).
- **Root Cause**: Uniform appointment scheduling does not account for variability in complexity.
- **Proposed Action**: Use data-driven appointment scheduling (e.g., buffer times for complex cases, different slots for "New" vs. "Follow-up").
- **Impact**: Expected 25% reduction in average Follow-up visit time.

### 4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints

#### **Potential Trade-offs**

1. **Resource Overload**: Increasing resource availability could lead to staff fatigue and burnout.
2. **Cost Impact**: Hiring additional staff or extending working hours may increase operational costs.
3. **Care Quality**: Over-parallelization could lead to rushed care or miscommunication.

#### **Balancing Conflicting Objectives**

- Conduct **Cost-Benefit Analysis** for each optimization.
- Use **simulation modeling** to predict downstream impacts of proposed changes (e.g., shifted bottlenecks).
- Pilot changes in small departments to measure cost and quality trade-offs before scaling.

### 5. Measuring Success

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

1. **Process KPIs**:
	- Average patient wait time (by activity).
	- Percentage of patients with wait times above 15 minutes.
	- Overall visit duration (from start to check-out).
2. **Resource KPIs**:
	- Resource utilization rates (e.g., % time used for key staff/equipment).
3. **Patient KPIs**:
	- Patient satisfaction (via surveys).
	- Percentage of "Urgent" cases completed within clinical guidelines.

#### **Ongoing Process Monitoring**

- Leverage **real-time process mining tools** using live event logs.
- Implement dashboards to monitor KPIs and detect any new bottlenecks.
- Set **thresholds for alerts**: Notify management if waiting times exceed acceptable levels.
