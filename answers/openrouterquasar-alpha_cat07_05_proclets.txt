### **Overview**

This image illustrates a communication process in a healthcare setting involving lab visits and lab tests. It includes three parts:

1. **(a) Process interaction model**
2. **(b) Class diagram**
3. **(c) Example communication/performance message**

### **(a) Two proctet classes connected through two channels**

This section depicts the workflow of two interconnected processes: **Lab visit** and **Lab test**.

**Lab visit process:**
- **Actors:** doctor, lab assistant
- **Steps:**
  - *Order entry* (initiated by the doctor)
  - *Take blood sample* (by lab assistant)
  - *Send/Submit order* via **Order system**
  - *Receive result* from Lab test via **HIS** (Health Information System)
  - *Judge results*:
    - If fine: **Send report** to patient (finalizes process)
    - If not: undertake *Do tests again* and *Receive updated result*

**Lab test process:**
- **Actors:** chemical analysts
- **Steps:**
  - *Perform test*
  - *Make report*
  - *Finish lab test*
  - If necessary, *Perform test again* and *Provide updated report*

**Communication Channels:**
- **Order system:** Connects *Lab visit* to *Lab test* (sending requests to create a test order)
- **HIS:** For receiving the test results and updates between systems

### **(b) Class diagram containing the two proctet classes**

This diagram clarifies the relationship between the two processes:

- A **Lab visit** *requires* **one or more** **Lab tests** (1..* multiplicity)
- Each **Lab test** is associated with **exactly one** **Lab visit** (1..1 multiplicity)

### **(c) Example of a performative**

A message communication format including:

| Time   | Channel       | Sender               | Receivers             | Action   | Content                            | Scope    | Direction |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------|------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| 11:00  | Order system   | Lab visit - John    | Lab test - HGB John   | Create   | Can you perform an HGB test for John? | Private  | OUT       |

This represents an example message sent via the **Order system** from **Lab visit** to **Lab test** requesting an HGB (hemoglobin) test for a patient named John.

---

### **Summary**

- The visualization models a healthcare scenario where lab test orders and results flow between two interconnected systems (Lab visit and Lab test).
- It shows process steps, actor roles, communication pathways, and the nature of interaction.
- The class diagram captures the cardinality of the relationship.
- The performative example clarifies the structure of a typical message exchange in the process.

This visualization is useful for understanding process orchestration and communication within healthcare information systems.
