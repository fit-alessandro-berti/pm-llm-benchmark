Explanation of the logic
------------------------
1. **Case grouping**  
   - Each **document, email thread, or artifact on the desktop** became its own case (`case_id`).  
     – `Document1.docx`  `doc1-drafting` and subsequent follow-up (`cross-ref-content`).  
     – Email about the annual meeting  `email-annual`.  
     – The PDF  `review-report`.  
     – `Budget_2024.xlsx`  `excel-update`.  
     – `Quarterly_Report.docx`  `quart-rpt-prep`.  
   - A switch that **cross-references one artifact into another** (inserting budget figures into Document1) becomes the small bridging case `cross-ref-content`.

2. **Activity naming**  
   Low-level events were aggregated into *higher-level* process steps that analysts would recognise:  
   - `TYPING` became `Compose Text`, `Draft Executive Summary`, or `Update Budget Spreadsheet` depending on context.  
   - `OPEN/FOCUS` events were converted into descriptive start activities (e.g., `Open PDF for Review`).  
   - `HIGHLIGHT` in the PDF transformed into the analytical label `Annotate PDF`.

3. **Temporal order and sequence consistency**  
   Events are kept in strict ascending order; each case ends with the natural closing action (`Send`, `Save`, `Close`) before the user moves on.

The resulting log tells a coherent story:  
Create a draft Word document  Handle an email  Review a PDF  Update a spreadsheet  Integrate the update back into the draft  Resume working on the more formal quarterly report.
