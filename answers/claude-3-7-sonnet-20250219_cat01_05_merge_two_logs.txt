# Merged Event Log Analysis

I'll analyze both logs, match corresponding events, and create an integrated event log with enriched attributes.

## Event Matching Approach

1. **Primary matching criteria**: Order ID and timestamp proximity (within 2 seconds)
2. **Secondary matching**: Event name/type semantic similarity
3. **Resolution strategy**: For matched events, I'll combine all attributes and note any discrepancies

## Detailed Event Analysis

### Event 1: Order Received
- **Log A**: `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z, Order Received, Order#1234`
- **Log B**: `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, OrderReceived, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"`
- **Match**: ✓ (2-second difference, semantically identical event names)
- **Reasoning**: Clear match based on timestamp proximity and identical event meaning

### Event 2: Order Validated
- **Log A**: `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z, Order Validated, Order#1234`
- **Log B**: `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, OrderValidation, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"`
- **Match**: ✓ (1-second difference, semantically identical event names)
- **Reasoning**: Clear match based on timestamp proximity and identical event meaning

### Event 3: Payment Processed
- **Log A**: `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234`
- **Log B**: `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z, PaymentCheck, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"`
- **Match**: ✓ (5-second difference, semantically related event names)
- **Reasoning**: Although slightly outside the 2-second window, the semantic similarity of the event names and the logical sequence strongly suggests these are the same event. The note "Payment gateway delay" explains the timestamp difference.

### Event 4: Quality Check
- **Log A**: No matching event
- **Log B**: `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection"`
- **Match**: ✗ (Only in Log B)
- **Reasoning**: No corresponding event in Log A, likely because System A doesn't track quality inspections

### Event 5: Item Shipped
- **Log A**: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234`
- **Log B**: `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z, Shipping, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"`
- **Match**: ✓ (2-second difference, semantically identical event names)
- **Reasoning**: Clear match based on timestamp proximity and identical event meaning

### Event 6: Item Delivered
- **Log A**: `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234`
- **Log B**: No matching event
- **Match**: ✗ (Only in Log A)
- **Reasoning**: No corresponding event in Log B, likely because System B doesn't track delivery confirmation

## Summary of Matching Decisions

1. **Timestamp tolerance**: Generally used a 2-second window, with one exception for the Payment event where context justified a 5-second difference
2. **Event naming**: Matched events based on semantic similarity despite different naming conventions
3. **Unique events**: Preserved events that appeared in only one system
4. **Timestamp resolution**: Included both timestamps for merged events to maintain full data provenance
5. **Attribute integration**: Combined all available attributes from both systems for enriched event data

This integrated log provides a more complete view of the order fulfillment process while preserving the unique information from each system.
