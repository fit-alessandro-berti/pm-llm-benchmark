Based on the provided normative process description, I need to analyze each case in the event log to see if there are any deviations from the expected order of activities. The key rules I should consider are:

- Checking the inventory must occur immediately after receiving an order, before any other activities.
- Payment authorization is only meaningful after the inventory check, assuming sufficient stock is available.
- Packaging of items must come after the authorization of payment but before shipping.
- Shipping is only appropriate once the items are packaged.
- Cancellation occurs once inventory is found to be insufficient, and in such a scenario, the process should go directly to "Cancel order" followed by "Close order."
- "Close order" should be the last activity in any scenario.

**Case 1**

**Sequence:**
- Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order.

**Analysis:**
No deviation. The sequence aligns with the normative description for fulfilling orders when inventory is sufficient.

**Case 2**

**Sequence:**
- Receive order, Check inventory, Package items, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.

**Violation:**
There is a deviation here. According to the normative process, payment authorization should occur before the items are packaged. Case 2's activity flow violates this by packaging items before authorization, which is supposed to occur only after checking inventory and before packaging.

**Case 3**

**Sequence:**
- Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order.

**Violation:**
Case 3 deviates from the intended process after checking inventory. Once an order is canceled, shipping should not happen. "Ship order" appearing after a "Cancel order" entry is forbidden. This case represents an illogical flow because processes should not move towards fulfillment (shipping) after cancellation.

**Case 4**

**Sequence:**
- Receive order, Check inventory, Cancel order, Close order.

**Analysis:**
No deviation. The sequence aligns with the normative description for cancellation scenarios due to insufficient stock.

**Case 5**

**Sequence:**
- Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.

**Violation:**
This case violates the requirement that the items must be packaged before shipping. Case 5 skips the "Package items" activity before moving directly from authorization to shipping, which is not acceptable based on the process description.

**Summary**

- **Case 2:** Items packaged before payment authorization.
- **Case 3:** Shipping is included after an order cancellation.
- **Case 5:** Direct shipping without packaging the items.

These three cases—2, 3, and 5—deviate from the expected process flow and violate some of the basic constraints described in the normative flow.
