Here’s what the event log shows.

1) Which cases take significantly longer
- Baseline (low complexity, straight-through): 
  - Case 2001 (A/Low): 1h30m
  - Case 2004 (B/Low): 1h25m
- Long-running:
  - Case 2002 (B/Medium): 25h55m
  - Case 2003 (A/High): 48h20m
  - Case 2005 (B/High): 77h05m

2) What’s driving the delays (attribute patterns)

Strongest pattern: more “Request Additional Documents”  longer lead time
- Number of document requests vs cycle time:
  - 0 requests: ~1.4–1.5h (Cases 2001, 2004)
  - 1 request: 25h55m (Case 2002)
  - 2 requests: 48h20m (Case 2003)
  - 3 requests: 77h05m (Case 2005)
- The EvaluateApprove phase dominates total duration when requests occur:
  - Case 2002: 24h15m of 25h55m (93%)
  - Case 2003: 30h20m of 48h20m (63%)
  - Case 2005: 72h10m of 77h05m (94%)

Complexity
- All high-complexity cases (2003, 2005) have multiple document requests and are the slowest.
- Medium complexity (2002) still triggers a request and an overnight wait.
- Low complexity completes straight-through in ~1.5 hours regardless of region.

Region
- Low complexity: Region A (2001) and B (2004) are equally fast  no regional issue for simple work.
- High complexity: Region B (Case 2005) is slower than Region A (Case 2003): 77h vs 48h. This suggests an interaction effect: Region B + high complexity tends to have more/longer document cycles.

Resources
- Adjusters:
  - Adjuster_Mike (A): 0 requests (Case 2001), 2 requests (Case 2003).
  - Adjuster_Lisa (B): 0 requests (Case 2004), 1 request (Case 2002), 3 requests (Case 2005).
  - In the high-complexity cases, Lisa’s case (2005) has more request iterations and longer gaps between them (29.5h, 22h, 19h). This could indicate workload, thoroughness/training differences, or region-specific documentation demands. Sample size is small but the signal aligns with Region B + high complexity.
- Managers:
  - Manager_Bill appears only on high-complexity cases (2003, 2005). Approvals tend to occur later (e.g., 16:00), which can push payment to the next day. The gating effect exists but is secondary to the document cycle.
- Finance:
  - Payments are generally same-day within 0.5–4 hours after approval, except when approvals occur late afternoon (e.g., 2003 approved at 16:00  paid next morning). Finance is a minor contributor relative to the document cycle.

Time-of-day effect
- Requests or approvals late in the day create overnight waits, inflating lead time (e.g., 2002 request at 14:00  approval next morning; 2003 approval at 16:00  payment next morning).

3) Likely root causes and how to mitigate

Root causes
- High complexity  incomplete first request  multiple document request iterations; most of the total time is spent waiting in this loop.
- Region B on high complexity (often with Adjuster_Lisa) shows more rework and longer gaps between document requests, suggesting either:
  - Heavier workload/queues,
  - Less complete initial checklists,
  - Stricter or more varied regional requirements,
  - Customer responsiveness differences.
- Late-in-day actions (requests/approvals) trigger overnight delays.

Mitigations
- Reduce document-request rework (“first-time-right”):
  - Introduce a high-complexity checklist/template to compile a complete document package at the first request.
  - Require a brief peer review or senior adjuster “doc-list sanity check” before sending the first request on high-complexity cases.
  - Provide claimant-facing dynamic checklists and a guided upload portal with completeness checks.
  - Auto-enrich from external data sources where possible (police reports, repair estimates, medical billing) to shrink doc demands.
- Triage and specialization:
  - Route high-complexity claims to a specialized team; set an SLA for Evaluatefirst Request within 60 minutes and limit to one iteration whenever possible.
  - If a second request becomes necessary, trigger an automatic escalation/coaching review.
- Address Region B/high-complexity performance:
  - Review Adjuster_Lisa’s workload and WIP limits; rebalance assignments.
  - Targeted training on high-complexity doc requirements; align Region B documentation standards with Region A where feasible.
  - Provide region-specific checklists and examples to reduce back-and-forth.
- Time-of-day safeguards:
  - Set a cut-off for sending document requests late in the day; if after a threshold, proactively schedule a follow-up call next morning.
  - Reserve earlier approval slots for high-complexity cases so Finance can pay same day.
- Monitoring and controls:
  - Add KPIs: number of document requests per case, EvaluateApprove lead time, and rework rate by adjuster/region/complexity.
  - Build alerts when a case hits more than one document request or exceeds an EvaluateApprove SLA.

In short: Cases 2002, 2003, and especially 2005 take much longer, primarily because document-request loops dominate the cycle. High complexity is the main driver; Region B combined with high complexity shows the worst performance, likely due to additional rework and wait times. Tightening the first request quality, specializing high-complexity handling, balancing workloads in Region B, and managing time-of-day cutoffs should materially reduce lead times.
