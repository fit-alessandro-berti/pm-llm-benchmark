### Proposed High-Level Process Steps for Manufacturing Workflow

#### 1. **Material Preparation**
- **Description:** This step encompasses activities related to acquiring and preparing raw materials before they enter the assembly phase.
- **Examples of Low-Level Events:**
  - Retrieve raw metal sheet (CaseID: A1, Timestamp: 2024-03-01 08:00:05)
  - Scan barcode (PartID: M-045) 
  - Place metal sheet on table (TableID: T-3) 
  - Align metal sheet
  - Preheat metal sheet

#### 2. **Assembly**
- **Description:** This step involves the integration of pre-prepared materials to form complete components.
- **Examples of Low-Level Events:**
  - Pick up welding tool (Operator B, ToolID: W-12)
  - Weld corner A
  - Weld corner B 
  - Measure weld integrity

#### 3. **Quality Inspection**
- **Description:** This step includes checks and assessments to ensure the components meet specified quality standards.
- **Examples of Low-Level Events:**
  - Visual check (Operator C, Check: Passed)
  
### Justification for Groupings

1. **Material Preparation**:
   - These events are logically sequential steps that directly lead up to assembling a component. The retrieval and preparation of raw materials set the foundation before any assembly operations begin.

2. **Assembly**:
   - This group is consistent with manufacturing workflows where components must be joined together to form products. Events such as picking tools, performing welding, and measuring weld integrity are essential in ensuring that parts come together correctly.
   
3. **Quality Inspection**: 
   - Quality checks are a critical phase after assembly. These events ensure compliance with quality standards before the product is deemed fit for use or further processing.

### Naming of High-Level Activities

1. **Material Preparation**
2. **Assembly**  
3. **Quality Inspection**

These names clearly reflect their respective roles in the manufacturing process, making it easier to understand and analyze each phase separately while maintaining coherence across related events.

By categorizing low-level events into these high-level steps with defined justifications, we achieve a more organized view of the manufacturing workflow, enhancing clarity for both technical analysis and operational insights.
