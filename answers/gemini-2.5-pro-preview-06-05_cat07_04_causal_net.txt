This image displays a process model, likely representing a business workflow for handling a request, such as an insurance or compensation claim. The model is composed of two main parts: a flowchart diagram and a legend explaining the notation.

### 1. The Legend (Key)

The grey box at the bottom right serves as a legend for the different types of logical gateways (connectors) used in the flowchart:

*   **Splits (Diverging Paths):**
    *   **XOR-split:** An exclusive choice. The process flow takes exactly one of the outgoing paths.
    *   **AND-split:** A parallel split. The process flow takes all outgoing paths simultaneously.
    *   **OR-split:** An inclusive choice. The process flow can take one or more of the outgoing paths.

*   **Joins (Converging Paths):**
    *   **XOR-join:** A simple merge. The process continues as soon as one of the incoming paths arrives.
    *   **AND-join:** A synchronization point. The process waits for all incoming paths to complete before continuing.
    *   **OR-join:** A synchronizing merge. The process waits for all *active* incoming paths to complete. This is used to merge paths that were split by a corresponding OR-split.

### 2. The Process Flowchart

The main diagram illustrates a step-by-step process with several conditional paths and loops. The boxes with rounded corners represent activities or tasks.

Here is a breakdown of the process flow:

1.  **Start:** The process begins with activity **a: register request**.
2.  **Initial Examination (OR-split):** After the request is registered, an **OR-split** occurs. This means one or more of the following activities can be initiated:
    *   **b: examine thoroughly**
    *   **c: examine casually**
    *   **d: check ticket**
3.  **Decision Point (OR-join):** The paths from activities `b`, `c`, and `d` converge at an **OR-join** before activity **e: decide**. This means the process waits for all the initiated examination tasks to be completed before a decision is made.
4.  **The Decision and its Outcomes:** Activity `e` is a central decision hub.
    *   **Main Outcome (XOR-split):** The flow proceeds to an **XOR-split**, leading to one of two mutually exclusive outcomes:
        *   **g: pay compensation**
        *   **h: reject request**
    *   **End:** Both paths from `g` and `h` merge at an **XOR-join** and lead to the final state **z: end**, which concludes the process.
5.  **Loops and Rework:** The process includes several loops, indicating possibilities for rework or re-evaluation:
    *   **Re-initiation Loop:** From the `decide` step (`e`), there is a path to **f: reinitiate request**. This suggests that if the decision is neither to pay nor reject, the request might need to be re-processed.
    *   **Return to Start:** After `reinitiate request` (`f`), one path loops back to the beginning, just after `register request` (`a`), effectively restarting the examination phase.
    *   **Return to Check Ticket:** Another path from `f` leads back to `check ticket` (`d`). A similar path exists from `examine casually` (`c`) to `check ticket` (`d`), suggesting that a casual examination might trigger a need to check the ticket.
    *   **Check Ticket Self-Loop:** Activity `d` (`check ticket`) has a small loop back to itself, implying it might be a repetitive task.

In summary, the visualization depicts a complex and flexible process for handling requests. It starts with registration, moves to an inclusive examination phase, and culminates in a decision. The process can end with paying or rejecting the request, or it can be looped back for re-initiation or further checks.
