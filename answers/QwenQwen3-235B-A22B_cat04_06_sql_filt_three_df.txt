<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to write a DuckDB SQL query that filters out certain cases based on a sequence of activities and a time condition. Hmm.

First, the problem says to identify cases that have the exact sequence of three activities: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed by 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order'. And these must be consecutive with no other events in between. Then, among those cases, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Then exclude those cases from the final result. So, the final output should have all events except those in cases that met both the sequence and the timing condition.

Okay, how to approach this?

I think I need to find all the cases that have that exact three-event sequence. Then, for those sequences, check the time between Create and Confirm. If that time is more than 5 days, then exclude those cases.

So the steps would be:

1. Find all case_ids that have the sequence of three activities in order, consecutive.

2. For each of these, check the time difference between Create Order and Confirm Order.

3. Filter those cases where this time difference is more than 5 days.

4. Then, select all events from event_log where case_id is NOT in this filtered list.

But how do I find consecutive sequences of three events in SQL?

Hmm, DuckDB has window functions. Maybe using row_number() over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) to order the events in each case.

Then, for each case, we can look for rows where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and the next row is 'Create Order', and the row after that is 'Confirm Order'.

So, using lead() function perhaps.

Like, for each row, check if current activity is 'Approve...', lead(activity,1) is 'Create...', lead(activity,2) is 'Confirm...'.

And also that the timestamps are in order (but the order is enforced by the row_number, so maybe the lead is sufficient).

Wait, but if the events are ordered by timestamp, then consecutive rows would be the order of occurrence.

So for each row, if the current row and the next two rows (in the same case) form the sequence, then that's a match.

So using LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next1, LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next2.

Then, filter where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', next1 = 'Create Order', next2 = 'Confirm Order'.

That would give us the starting event of the three-event sequence. Each such occurrence would be in a case that has the consecutive sequence.

Then, once we have all such case_ids, we can then check the time difference between Create Order and Confirm Order events.

Wait, but how to get the timestamps for Create and Confirm in that sequence.

So for each row that is the start of the sequence (Approve), then the next row is Create, and then Confirm.

So for the Approve row, the Create is next1, so its timestamp would be the timestamp of the current row's next row. Similarly, the Confirm's timestamp would be the lead(timestamp, 2).

So for each such Approve row that has the next two activities, we can get the Create's timestamp and Confirm's timestamp.

Then calculate the difference between Confirm.timestamp and Create.timestamp. If that's more than 5 days, then we need to include this case_id in the list of cases to exclude.

Once we have all those case_ids, then the final query is all events where case_id not in that list.

So putting it all together:

First, find all the cases with the sequence.

Then, for each such case, check the time between Create and Confirm.

Now, how to structure this.

Maybe a CTE that identifies all the sequences, then calculates the time difference, then filter those with >5 days.

So:

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        timestamp AS approve_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts
    FROM event_log
    WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
    -- Wait, but this WHERE clause would filter out other activities, but we need to check the consecutive sequence in the entire log. So if there are other activities in between, but we just ignore them, but in this approach, the LEADs would skip them. Wait, no.

Wait, no. Because the LEAD functions are applied over all events in the case ordered by timestamp, regardless of their activity. So if we have a row with Approve, then some other activity, then Create, then the LEAD(1) would be that other activity, not Create. So the filtering on activity in the CTE would not be correct.

So the problem with including that WHERE clause is that we would exclude events not in the three activities, but we need to process all events to check the sequence.

Ah, right. So the CTE should look at all events, and then in the WHERE clause, filter to find the rows where the current activity is Approve, next1 is Create, next2 is Confirm.

So:

First, create a CTE that for each event in each case, compute the next 1 and next 2 activities and timestamps.

Then, filter for rows where the current activity is 'Approve', next1 is 'Create', next2 is 'Confirm'.

Then, in that subset, get the create_ts and confirm_ts, and calculate the difference.

Then, collect all case_ids where this difference is >5 days.

So:

WITH Sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        timestamp AS approve_time,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_time,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_time
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT * FROM Sequences;

Wait, but Sequences would have all events, but only those events that have two subsequent events in the same case. Hmm. Then, filter in the Sequences CTE:

SELECT
    case_id,
    approve_time,
    create_time,
    confirm_time
FROM (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        timestamp,
        activity,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next1_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next2_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_time,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_time
    FROM event_log
) sub
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND next1_activity = 'Create Order'
  AND next2_activity = 'Confirm Order'

Yes. This subquery approach would work. So:

The inner subquery gets each event, and its next two events (activity and timestamp). Then, filter where the current activity is Approve, next1 is Create, next2 is Confirm.

Then, for each such row, we have the case_id, create_time, confirm_time. Then, compute the difference between confirm_time and create_time.

In DuckDB, to calculate the difference in days, we can use the DATE_DIFF function.

So:

For each such case in the filtered subquery, if confirm_time - create_time > 5 days, then collect the case_id.

Once we have all those case_ids, then the final query is to select all events where case_id NOT IN that list.

Wait, but note that a case can have multiple instances of the sequence. For example, two separate sequences of Approve, Create, Confirm. Each of these sequences would be considered. If any of them have the time difference >5 days, then the case should be excluded. Wait, no: the problem says "cases that have the sequence and then time between Create and Confirm >5 days". So if a case has even one such sequence with the time condition, then all events in that case are excluded?

Wait, according to the prompt:

"you need to identify any case that contains the three-activity sequence [...] and the time between Create and Confirm is more than 5 days. Then exclude them from your final result."

So if a case has at least one occurrence of the sequence followed by the time condition, then the entire case's events are excluded.

So our list of case_ids to exclude is all case_ids that have at least one such sequence with the time condition.

So the plan:

1. Find all case_ids that have at least one occurrence of the sequence (three in a row) with time between Create and Confirm >5 days.

Then, in the final query, select all events where case_id NOT IN that list.

Now, how to implement that.

Putting this together:

First, the CTE:

WITH SequenceWithTimes AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        create_time,
        confirm_time
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next1,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next2,
            timestamp,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_time,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_time
        FROM event_log
    ) sub
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next1 = 'Create Order'
      AND next2 = 'Confirm Order'
),
FilteredCases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM SequenceWithTimes
    WHERE confirm_time > create_time + INTERVAL 5 days
    -- Or using DATE_DIFF, but DuckDB's interval math should handle this.
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM FilteredCases)

Wait, but in DuckDB, handling intervals: adding 5 days could be done with create_time + INTERVAL '5 days'.

But confirm_time > create_time + 5 days would be correct. Or using DATE_DIFF.

But need to make sure that the difference between confirm_time and create_time is more than 5 days.

In DuckDB, DATE_DIFF('day', create_time, confirm_time) >5 ?

Wait, DATE_DIFF returns the number of intervals between two dates. So if confirm_time is 5 days and 1 hour after create_time, DATE_DIFF('day', create_time, confirm_time) would be 5. But the actual elapsed time is more than 5 days (5 days and 1 hour). Hmm. So using (confirm_time - create_time) > INTERVAL '5 days' would be better. Because interval comparison would check if the time difference is more than 5 days.

But DuckDB's timestamp subtraction? Wait, DuckDB has support for interval types.

Wait, if create_time and confirm_time are TIMESTAMPs, then confirm_time - create_time gives an interval.

So, in DuckDB:

WHERE confirm_time - create_time > INTERVAL '5 days'

But how to handle that. Let's check.

Yes, in DuckDB, the subtraction of two timestamps gives an interval. So yes, we can do:

WHERE confirm_time - create_time > INTERVAL '5 days'

But perhaps in the FilteredCases CTE:

SELECT case_id
FROM SequenceWithTimes
WHERE confirm_time - create_time > INTERVAL '5 days'

But wait, the create_time and confirm_time in the SequenceWithTimes CTE are the timestamps of Create and Confirm events. So yes.

But wait, in the inner query:

In the subquery, create_time is the LEAD(timestamp, 1) when current event is Approve. So that's the Create event's timestamp.

Similarly, confirm_time is the LEAD(timestamp, 2), which is the Confirm event's timestamp.

So create_time and confirm_time are the Create and Confirm events. So the time between Create and Confirm is confirm_time - create_time. We need to filter when this is more than 5 days.

Thus, in the FilteredCases CTE:

WHERE confirm_time - create_time > INTERVAL '5 days'

Now, putting all together:

WITH SequenceWithTimes AS (
    SELECT
        sub.case_id,
        sub.create_time,
        sub.confirm_time
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next1,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next2,
            timestamp,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_time,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_time
        FROM event_log
    ) sub
    WHERE sub.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND sub.next1 = 'Create Order'
      AND sub.next2 = 'Confirm Order'
), FilteredCases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM SequenceWithTimes
    WHERE confirm_time - create_time > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM FilteredCases)

Wait, but this would have all the cases in FilteredCases excluded.

But wait, the problem says: exclude cases that have the sequence AND the time condition. So cases that have the sequence but not the time condition are not excluded.

But this query does that: FilteredCases are those that have both the sequence and the time condition.

So the final query returns all events from cases that are not in FilteredCases. That meets the requirement.

But wait: what if a case has multiple sequences, one with the time condition and others without? Then it would be in FilteredCases and thus excluded.

Now, possible edge cases.

Another thing: the case_id could be NULL? Probably not, given the problem description.

Now, possible issues:

1. The inner query in SequenceWithTimes may have multiple rows per case_id, each representing a possible sequence.

But in the FilteredCases, we just select case_id if any of their sequences meet the time condition.

That's correct.

But in the FilteredCases CTE, using SELECT DISTINCT case_id? Because if a case has multiple qualifying sequences, it's still just once in the list.

But in the 'NOT IN' clause, duplicates don't matter. However, using SELECT DISTINCT may be more efficient.

So maybe:

FilteredCases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM SequenceWithTimes
    WHERE confirm_time - create_time > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

But not necessary, since NOT IN with duplicates still works.

Another thing: in the inner subquery, the LEAD functions are ordered by timestamp, which is correct.

But in DuckDB, the LEAD functions would return NULL if there isn't a next row. So the WHERE clause in the inner query would filter out any rows where Approve is followed by less than two events. Which is correct.

So, this approach should work.

Testing.

Suppose a case has:

Approve

Create

Confirm

Time between Create and Confirm is 6 days.

Then, the inner query would pick this sequence, FilteredCases would have this case_id, and the final query would exclude all events in this case.

If the time was 5 days exactly or less, then not excluded.

If a case has the three events in order, but not consecutive. Like:

Approve, Other Activity, Create, Confirm.

Then the inner query would not find a row where Approve's next1 is Create and next2 is Confirm. So that case would not be in FilteredCases.

Thus, the query correctly captures only consecutive sequences.

So this should handle all the cases.

Potential problem: if the timestamps are not in order. Wait, the window function orders by timestamp. So the LEADs are ordered by timestamp ascending. So the Create event would have a later timestamp than Approve, Confirm than Create.

But the problem says that the timestamp is when the activity occurred. So the ordering should be correct.

But what if the data has multiple events with same timestamp? Hmm. Then the order of events would be undefined, which could cause issues. But the problem doesn't mention handling such cases, so we can assume that timestamps are unique and ordered.

Thus, the query should be correct.

So the final query is as above.
</think>

To address the problem, we need to filter out all events from cases that:

1. **Contain the exact sequence** of activities: `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`, `'Create Order'`, `'Confirm Order'` in **direct succession** (i.e., no other events in between).
2. **Have a time gap** of **more than 5 days** between the `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` events in that sequence.
3. **Exclude all events** from such cases from the final result.

We can achieve this using **window functions** to detect sequences and **interval comparisons** to measure time differences. Here's the final query:

###  Final DuckDB SQL Query

```sql
WITH SequenceWithTimes AS (
    SELECT
        sub.case_id,
        sub.create_time,
        sub.confirm_time
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next1,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next2,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_time,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_time
        FROM event_log
    ) sub
    WHERE sub.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND sub.next1 = 'Create Order'
      AND sub.next2 = 'Confirm Order'
),
FilteredCases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM SequenceWithTimes
    WHERE confirm_time - create_time > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM FilteredCases);
```

---

###  Explanation

1. **SequenceWithTimes CTE**:
   - Uses `LEAD()` to look ahead in the event log for each case.
   - Identifies all cases where the sequence `'Approve'  'Create'  'Confirm'` occurs **consecutively**.
   - Captures the timestamps of the `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` events for each such sequence.

2. **FilteredCases CTE**:
   - Filters the identified sequences to only those where the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` is **more than 5 days**.
   - Uses `DISTINCT` to ensure each case is only listed once, even if it has multiple qualifying sequences.

3. **Final SELECT**:
   - Returns **all events** from the `event_log` table **excluding** those from cases that matched both the sequence and the time condition.

---

###  Notes

- This query assumes that `timestamp` is of type `TIMESTAMP` or `DATE` in DuckDB.
- The use of `INTERVAL '5 days'` ensures accurate interval-based comparisons.
- The query is efficient for large datasets due to the use of window functions and avoids unnecessary joins or subqueries.

---

This approach ensures that only the cases meeting **both** the sequence and timing criteria are excluded from the final result set.
