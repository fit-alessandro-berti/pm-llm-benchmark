The user wants an analysis: identify which cases have significantly longer total resolution times compared to others; determine potential root causes; explain how these factors lead to increased cycle times and propose insights or recommendations.

We have event log with 5 cases: 101-105. Let's compute durations:

Case 101: Received at 2024-03-01 08:00, closed at 2024-03-01 10:15. Duration: 2h 15m (2.25 hours). No escalation, quick.

Case 102: Received at 2024-03-01 08:05, closed at 2024-03-02 09:15. That's 1 day + 1h10m? Let's calculate: from 08:05 2024-03-01 to 09:15 2024-03-02: 24h + 1h10m = 25h10m. That's approx 25.17 hours. So about 25 hours. Contains escalation to Level-2 at 11:30, then investigate issue at 14:00, then next day resolve at 09:00. There's a long gap between escalation and investigation: from 11:30 to 14:00 same day (2.5h). Then a long gap from investigation (14:00) to next day resolve (09:00) ~19 hours? Actually 14:00 to 09:00 next day is 19 hours, but it's a different day. That's a long waiting period before resolution.

Case 103: Received 08:10, closed 09:30 same day, 1h20m. Very quick.

Case 104: Received 08:20, closed 2024-03-02 08:30 => 24h10m? Let's compute: 08:20 on March 1 to 08:30 on March 2 = 24h10m (24h +10m). So about 24.17 hours. Investigate at 13:00 (same day), resolve at 08:00 next day. That's a 19-hour gap between investigation and resolution (13:00 -> 08:00 next day). So there is a big delay after investigation.

Case 105: Received 08:25, closed 2024-03-03 09:30. That's 2 days + 1h5m? Let's compute: 08:25 March 1 to 09:30 March 3 = 2 days + 1h5m = 48h + 1h5m = 49h5m (approx 49.08h). Contains escalation to Level-2 at 10:00 same day, then investigation by Level-2 at 14:00 next day (i.e., after ~28h wait). Then resolution after that: 09:00 two days later, which is approx 19h after second investigation. Actually timeline: 105 escalation at 10:00 on March1, next "Investigate Issue" at 14:00 March 2 (that's 28h later). Then "Resolve Ticket" at 09:00 March 3 (that's 19h later). So huge delays.

Thus, cases 102, 104, and 105 have long durations. Those with escalations (102, 105) have longer durations. Also 104 is long without escalation? It had no escalation but had a big delay after investigation (maybe waiting for resolution). However 104 also had relatively long triage and assign times but no escalation.

Potential root causes:

- Escalation to Level-2 introduces extra handling time and possibly wait for specialized resources. Cases 102 and 105 show escalation, with large gaps between escalation and investigation, and between investigation and resolution.

- Long waiting times after investigation before resolution (cases 104, 105, 102) indicate that after the actual work is done, the ticket is not being resolved quickly; maybe waiting for approval, for the agent to mark resolved, or for customer confirmation.

- Triage and assignment may be delayed for certain tickets, possibly due to workload or mis-prioritization.

- The timeline suggests that after investigation, there may be manual follow-up, like awaiting customer feedback, or waiting for some internal process.

- Cases that involve escalation (level-2) also may involve handoff delays, unavailability of specialized agents, and longer processing.

- For case 104, there was a gap between investigation (13:00) and resolution (08:00 next day). This might indicate that the investigation didn't fully resolve; maybe they needed additional info or approval.

- The average resolution time across the five cases: 101 (2.25h), 102 (25.17h), 103 (1.33h), 104 (24.17h), 105 (49.08h). Average is about (2.25+25.17+1.33+24.17+49.08)/5 = 101.999/5  20.4h. So any above ~20h are significantly longer: 102, 104, 105. The standard deviation might be high. Using median (~24?), but anyway.

Now root cause analysis: (1) Escalation to Level-2 leads to extra time because Level-2 may have limited capacity and may not be available immediately. The gap between escalation and next activity (Investigate) is too large: case 102: escalation at 11:30, investigate at 14:00 (2.5h) but then wait until next day to resolve (19h). In case 105: escalation at 10:00, next investigation at 14:00 next day (28h). This suggests that escalation triggers a hand-off but the second-level team might not start work until next day. The cause could be shift schedules: level-2 only works business hours or only certain times, while level-1 continues working.

- Additionally, after investigation, there may be a "pending" status awaiting resolution: maybe the agent needs to input resolution details, but they wait until next day because of shift handoff.

- Also, maybe there is a lack of automated closure; resolution and closure may be manual, causing delays.

Potential recommendations:

- Improve escalation handling: ensure Level-2 agents are available promptly, perhaps have on-call rotation, or enable asynchronous handoff.

- Implement "Investigation Complete" trigger to automatically propose resolution, reducing manual delay.

- Add SLA for post-investigation resolution (e.g., within X hours) to avoid overnight gaps.

- For cases with no escalation but still long (case 104), review the handoff from investigation to resolution: maybe the agent resolved but didn't close due to missing steps; could add an auto-escalation to manager if resolution not logged within a certain time.

- Use case prioritization: ensure high-impact tickets get faster triage and assignment, reducing wait times.

- Consider analyzing the timestamp of each activity more granularly: find which activity has longest wait: e.g., "Assign to Level-1 Agent" to "Investigate Issue" is small; but biggest delays are between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket" across many cases.

- Suggest implementing a real-time monitoring dashboard that flags tickets that have been in "Investigate" for > X hours.

- Provide training for Level-1 agents to resolve more tickets without escalation; possibly build knowledge base.

- Maybe implement parallel processing: while awaiting escalation, continue other tasks.

- Suggest analyzing the overall process: remove redundant steps (maybe "Assign to Level-1 Agent" is not needed for escalated cases; can assign directly to Level-2).

Now produce a thorough answer with bullet points: Identify long cases; compute durations; highlight root causes; propose recommendations.

Will also mention metrics: total resolution time, wait times between activities.

**1.  Which cases are “significantly” slower than the rest?**  

| CaseID | Receivetime | Closetime | Total elapsed time* |Escalation? |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------------|--------------|
| 101 | 2024030108:00 | 2024030110:15 | **2h15m** | No |
| 102 | 2024030108:05 | 2024030209:15 | **25h10m** | Yes –Escalate to Level2 |
| 103 | 2024030108:10 | 2024030109:30 | **1h20m** | No |
| 104 | 2024030108:20 | 2024030208:30 | **24h10m** | No |
| 105 | 2024030108:25 | 2024030309:30 | **49h05m** | Yes –Escalate to Level2 |

\*Elapsed time = *Close*–*Receive* (rounded to the nearest minute).

- **Average resolution time** across the five tickets = (2h15m+25h10m+1h20m+24h10m+49h05m)/5  **20h24m**.  
- Tickets whose total time is **1×average (20h)** can be flagged as “longrunning”.  
- **Cases102,104 and105** clearly exceed this threshold; 105 is more than **2×average** and is the clear outlier.

**2.  Where are the biggest timegaps?**

| CaseID | ActivitytoActivity wait (hours) | Notable gaps |
|---------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| **101** | All steps 1h | – |
| **102** | •EscalateInvestigate: **2.5h**  <br>•InvestigateResolve: **19h** (overnight) | Long “pendingresolution” after investigation |
| **103** | All steps 1h | – |
| **104** | •InvestigateResolve: **19h** (overnight) | Same pattern as 102 – after the work is done the ticket sits for almost a day |
| **105** | •EscalateInvestigate (Level2): **28h**  <br>•InvestigateResolve: **19h** | Two distinct handoff delays – escalation and postinvestigation pending |

**Takeaway:**  
- **Escalation** (cases102 &105) introduces a *handoff* delay before the next investigation starts (2.5h in 102, 28h in 105).  
- **Postinvestigation “pending”** is the dominant delay in *all* long cases (102,104,105). After the actual work is completed, the ticket stays open for ~19h before the “Resolve” activity is recorded.

**3.  Rootcause hypothesis**

| Potential cause | Evidence from the log | How it inflates cycle time |
|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Limited Level2 capacity / shift schedule** | Escalated tickets (102,105) wait many hours before Level2 begins investigation (2.5h & 28h). | Handoff latency  whole ticket stretched by a whole shift (or more). |
| **Manual “resolveandclose” step** | After investigation, there is a ~19h gap before “Resolve” is logged in 102,104,105. | The work is done but the agent must manually mark the ticket resolved – often delayed until the next business day or until the agent is free. |
| **Lack of automated escalation triggers** | Escalation occurs, but the next activity (“Investigate”) is not triggered automatically; depends on Level2 availability. | Unnecessary waiting time that could be reduced by oncall rotation or autorouting. |
| **Ticketlevel priority / workload imbalance** | 104 has no escalation yet still takes >24h; triagetoassign took 1h (08:2009:30) which is comparable to faster tickets, but the postinvestigation wait is identical to escalated cases. | Indicates a systemic “pendingresolution” bottleneck, not just escalation. |
| **Missing “investigationcomplete” notification** | In all long cases the “Resolve” activity is recorded many hours after the last investigation. | Suggests the system does not automatically prompt the agent to close the ticket once investigation is finished. |

In short, **two interrelated problems** dominate:

1. **Escalation handoff delays** – Level2 resources are not instantly available, causing a waiting period before the ticket can be worked on again.  
2. **Postinvestigation “pendingresolution”** – after the technical work is done the ticket lingers, often overnight, because the closure step is manual and not triggered by the completion of investigation.

**4.  Recommendations to shrink the cycle time**

| # | Recommendation | Expected impact |
|---|----------------|-----------------|
| **A** | **Implement a “Level2 oncall” or “followthesun” model** – ensure at least one senior agent is available whenever an escalation occurs (e.g., a shared queue with automatic roundrobin). | Cuts the escalationtoinvestigation gap from hours to minutes. |
| **B** | **Autogenerate a “Resolve” prompt** when the last “Investigate” activity is logged. If the agent does not confirm within a predefined SLA (e.g., 2h), raise a reminder to a team lead. | Removes the 19h overnight lag; the ticket will be resolved the same day the investigation finishes. |
| **C** | **Introduce a “pendingresolution” SLA** – e.g., “Resolve must be recorded within 4h of the last investigation”. Monitor tickets breaching this SLA in a realtime dashboard. | Drives accountability and reduces manual lag. |
| **D** | **Optimise the escalation path** – for known complex issue types, route the ticket directly to Level2 at the “Assign” stage, skipping a Level1 investigation that will inevitably be escalated. | Eliminates the redundant Level1 investigation step, saving ~23h per escalated case. |
| **E** | **Add a “quickclose” button** for tickets that meet clear resolution criteria (e.g., “customer confirmed fix”). This can be done while the agent is still online, avoiding a later “close” activity. | Reduces the number of distinct “Resolve” & “Close” steps, cutting overall handling time. |
| **F** | **Capacitybased routing** – if the Level1 queue >X tickets, automatically promote the oldest tickets to Level2 (or a senior pool) to balance load. | Prevents a backlog of tickets that would otherwise wait for a Level1 agent, reducing the overall average. |
| **G** | **Postanalysis review** – after each week, run a simple loganalysis (like the one above) to identify any new patterns (e.g., new escalation delays, recurring “pendingresolution” spikes). | Continuous improvement loop; prevents new bottlenecks from becoming systemic. |

**Implementation roadmap (shortterm  mediumterm)**  

1. **Immediate (this week)** – Enable an alert for tickets that stay in “Investigate” >4h without a “Resolve”. This requires only a simple rule in the casemanagement system.  
2. **This sprint** – Add the “quickclose” button and autoprompt after investigation (recommendationsB&E).  
3. **Next 24 weeks** – Set up a small oncall roster for Level2 (recommendationA) and adjust routing logic to skip Level1 for highcomplexity categories (recommendationD).  
4. **Quarterly** – Review the aggregated resolutiontime distribution to validate that the median drops below 8h (the current bestinclass for similar support organizations).

### Summary

- **Longrunning tickets:** 102,104 and105 (24h).  
- **Key bottlenecks:**  
  *Escalation handoff delays* (especially for 102 & 105) and *postinvestigation pendingresolution gaps* (present in all three long tickets).  
- **Impact:** Each unwanted hour inflates the overall cycle time, lowers SLA compliance, and can frustrate customers.  
- **Actionable fixes:** Ensure Level2 is reachable instantly, automate the “resolve” step after investigation, and enforce tight SLAs for the pendingresolution phase.  

By tackling the handoff latency and the manual “closeticket” lag, the organization can bring the average resolution time back down to the 24hour range demonstrated by cases101 and103, while still handling complex escalations efficiently.
