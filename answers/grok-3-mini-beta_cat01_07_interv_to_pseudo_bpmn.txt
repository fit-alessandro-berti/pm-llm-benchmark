First, I need to create a BPMN-like textual process model from these interview excerpts. The output should be a structured textual description that someone could use to draw a BPMN diagram. Key elements include activities/tasks, sequence flow, gateways/decision points, roles/participants, artifacts/inputs/outputs, and exceptions/variations.

Summarize the main process from the interviews:

- The process starts when an invoice arrives, typically via email.

- Initial check: Does it have a valid PO number?

- If no PO, it's sent back to the supplier.

- If yes, it's logged into the accounting system.

- Then, it's forwarded to Purchasing for confirmation of receipt and matching with PO.

- If there are discrepancies, there might be clarifications or escalations.

- After confirmation, it's sent to the Department Manager for approval.

- If approved, it's scheduled for payment.

- Exceptions involve escalations to supervisors or supplier relationship managers.

Now, identify the key elements:

**Activities/Tasks:**

- Receive invoice

- Check for PO number

- Send back to supplier if no PO

- Log invoice into accounting system

- Forward to Purchasing for confirmation

- Match invoice against PO

- Confirm receipt of goods/services

- Resolve discrepancies (which might involve contacting supplier, escalating, etc.)

- Send to Department Manager for approval

- Approve or reject invoice

- Schedule for payment

From the interviews, some tasks are handled by specific roles:

- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary): Handles initial checks, logging, forwarding, matching.

- Purchasing Officer (Dan): Confirms receipt and matches invoice to PO.

- Department Manager (Carlos): Approves the invoice.

- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita): Handles escalations and exceptions.

- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen): Helps with supplier communications for issues.

**Sequence Flow:**

Based on Mary's description:

1. Receive invoice

2. Check for PO

- If no PO, send back to supplier

- If yes, log into system

3. Forward to Purchasing

4. Purchasing confirms receipt and matches

- If discrepancies, resolve (which might loop back or escalate)

5. After confirmation, send to Manager for approval

6. If approved, schedule for payment

Dan and Carlos confirm this flow from their perspectives.

**Gateways/Decision Points:**

- Decision: Does invoice have PO number? (Exclusive gateway)

  - Yes: Proceed to log

  - No: Send back to supplier

- After forwarding to Purchasing: Is there a discrepancy? (Decision point)

  - If yes, resolve (which could involve multiple steps)

  - If no, proceed to Manager approval

- Manager's decision: Approve or reject?

  - If reject, might investigate or hold

- Also, in exceptions, if issues can't be resolved, escalate.

From Rita's interview, there are cases where invoices don't have PO but are for informal services, leading to retrospective actions.

**Roles/Participants:**

- Accounts Payable Clerk (e.g., Mary)

- Purchasing Officer (e.g., Dan)

- Department Manager (e.g., Carlos)

- Accounts Payable Supervisor (e.g., Rita)

- Supplier Relationship Manager (e.g., Karen)

- Supplier (external)

**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**

- Invoice (input, document)

- Purchase Order (PO) (artifact, used for matching)

- Confirmation emails

- System notifications for approvals

- Payment scheduling

**Exceptions/Variations:**

- No PO: Send back or, in some cases (Rita), create retrospective PO

- Discrepancies: Resolve by contacting supplier, escalate to supervisor or Karen

- Manager rejection: Investigate further

- Rework loops: If discrepancies, might loop back to clarification steps

Now, I need to consolidate conflicting accounts. From the interviews, there's general agreement, but some variations:

- Mary says if no PO, send back. Rita mentions sometimes no PO for informal services, and they might create a retrospective PO.

- Discrepancy resolution: Can involve multiple people (Dan, Mary, Rita, Karen)

I should note uncertainties, like the exact path for exceptions.

Structure the textual description in a BPMN-like format. Since it's textual, I can use a step-by-step narrative with elements like:

- Start event: Invoice arrival

- Tasks with roles

- Gateways with conditions

- End events

Use a format like:

- Process starts with [Event]

- Then [Task] performed by [Role]

- Decision: [Condition]? If yes, [Path]; if no, [Path]

- Etc.

End with [Event]

Also, include parallel or alternative flows where applicable.

Outline the main flow:

1. Start: Invoice received

2. Task: Check for PO number by Accounts Payable Clerk

3. Gateway: Exclusive - If no PO, send back to supplier and end or loop? (Mary says send back, but it might be resent later)

   - If no PO, Task: Send back to supplier (by AP Clerk), then end or wait for resubmission. But since it's a process instance, perhaps it ends, and a new instance starts when resent.

   - In BPMN, this could be an end event or a loop.

   From Rita, sometimes they handle no PO internally, so add a variation.

4. If yes PO, Task: Log invoice into accounting system by AP Clerk

5. Task: Forward to Purchasing for confirmation by AP Clerk

6. Task: Purchasing confirms receipt and matches invoice to PO by Purchasing Officer

7. Gateway: Is there a discrepancy?

   - If no, proceed

   - If yes, resolve discrepancy (which could be a sub-process)

8. After no discrepancy or resolution, Task: Send to Department Manager for approval

9. Task: Manager reviews and approves or rejects

10. Gateway: If approved, schedule for payment; if rejected, handle rejection (e.g., investigate)

11. End: Payment scheduled

For the resolution of discrepancies, it's complex:

- Might involve emailing Purchasing, contacting supplier, escalating to supervisor or Karen.

This could be modeled as a sub-process or with additional gateways.

To keep it clear, I can describe the main flow and then note exception paths.

Final output should be textual, so perhaps use a structured list or pseudo-BPMN notation.

Example structure:

- **Start Event:** Invoice Arrival

- **Task:** Check for Valid PO Number (performed by Accounts Payable Clerk)

- **Exclusive Gateway:** PO Present?

  - **Yes Path:**

    - **Task:** Log Invoice into Accounting System (Accounts Payable Clerk)

    - **Task:** Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Confirmation (Accounts Payable Clerk)

    - **Task:** Confirm Receipt and Match Invoice to PO (Purchasing Officer)

    - **Exclusive Gateway:** Discrepancy Found?

      - **No Path:**

        - **Task:** Send to Department Manager for Approval (system automated)

        - **Task:** Manager Approval (Department Manager)

        - **Exclusive Gateway:** Approved?

          - **Yes Path:**

            - **Task:** Schedule for Payment (Accounts Payable Clerk)

            - **End Event:** Payment Scheduled

          - **No Path:**

            - **Task:** Reject and Investigate (Department Manager or escalate)

            - Possibly loop back or end

      - **Yes Path (Discrepancy):**

        - **Task:** Resolve Discrepancy (could involve multiple roles: Purchasing, AP Clerk, Supplier Relationship Manager, or escalate to Supervisor)

        - After resolution, go back to Confirmation or proceed

  - **No Path (No PO):**

    - **Task:** Send Back to Supplier (Accounts Payable Clerk)

    - Or, in some cases, **Task:** Handle Informal Invoice (e.g., create retrospective PO, involving Supervisor)

    - End Event or loop

Note ambiguities: For no PO, Mary says send back, but Rita says sometimes handle internally. So, I should indicate that.

For discrepancy resolution, it's not fully specified, so describe it generally.

Ensure the description is logical and coherent.

Write it in a clear, step-by-step manner.

Below is a BPMN-like textual process model for the invoice approval process, based on the consolidated information from the provided interview excerpts. This model captures the key elements specified in the task: activities/tasks, sequence flow, gateways/decision points, roles/participants, artifacts/inputs/outputs, and exceptions/variations. I have strived for clarity and logical coherence by synthesizing the accounts from all interviewees (Mary, Dan, Carlos, Rita, and Karen). Where there are inconsistencies or ambiguities in the transcripts (e.g., handling invoices without a PO number), I have noted them explicitly to indicate uncertainty.

The model is described in a structured, step-by-step textual format that mimics BPMN elements. This format uses:
- **Start/End Events** to denote the beginning and end of the process.
- **Tasks** to describe activities, including the role responsible.
- **Sequence Flow** to outline the order of steps.
- **Exclusive Gateways** to represent decision points with conditional branches.
- **Roles/Participants** integrated into task descriptions.
- **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs** mentioned where relevant (e.g., as data objects).
- **Exceptions/Variations** highlighted in conditional paths or notes.

The description is designed to be unambiguous enough for someone to convert it into a visual BPMN diagram.

### **BPMN-Like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

#### **Process Overview**
This model describes the standard invoice approval process based on the accounts of key stakeholders. The process begins when an invoice is received and ends when it is either scheduled for payment or rejected. The main flow is linear with decision points for handling PO validation, discrepancies, and approvals. Exceptions, such as invoices without a PO or unresolved discrepancies, introduce variations and potential rework loops.

#### **Start Event**
- **Event:** Invoice Arrival  
  - **Description:** An invoice is received, typically via email.  
  - **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice (input document), which may include details like supplier information, line items, and a potential PO number.  
  - **Roles Involved:** Accounts Payable Clerk (e.g., Mary) is the primary handler at this stage.

#### **Task 1: Check for Valid PO Number**
- **Description:** The Accounts Payable Clerk reviews the invoice to determine if it has a valid purchase order (PO) number.  
- **Performed by:** Accounts Payable Clerk.  
- **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice (input), PO Number (data object, referenced for validation).  
- **Sequence Flow:** This is the first step after invoice arrival.

#### **Exclusive Gateway: PO Number Present?**
- **Description:** A decision point based on the presence of a valid PO number. If no PO is found, the process branches to handle the exception; if a PO is present, it proceeds to logging.  
- **Conditions:**
  - **No Path (No PO):** If the invoice lacks a PO number, it is sent back to the supplier for clarification. In some cases (based on Rita's account), it may be handled internally by creating a retrospective PO, but this is not standard and depends on the invoice type (e.g., informal services).  
    - **Task 2a: Send Back to Supplier or Handle Internally**  
      - **Description:** The Accounts Payable Clerk emails the supplier to request a corrected invoice with a PO number. If the invoice is for informal services, it may be escalated to the Accounts Payable Supervisor to create a retrospective PO or decide on rejection.  
      - **Performed by:** Accounts Payable Clerk (primary); Accounts Payable Supervisor (for internal handling).  
      - **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice (output, sent back or flagged); Email notification (data object).  
      - **Roles Involved:** Supplier (external participant) is contacted. Supplier Relationship Manager (e.g., Karen) may be involved to facilitate communication.  
      - **Exceptions/Variations:** This path may lead to a rework loop if the supplier resubmits the invoice, starting a new process instance. Uncertainty exists due to conflicting accounts: Mary emphasizes sending back, while Rita notes internal handling for certain cases.  
      - **End Event (for this path):** Invoice Returned or Rejected  
        - **Description:** The process ends here if the invoice is sent back or rejected internally. A new instance may begin if the supplier resubmits.
  - **Yes Path (PO Present):** If a valid PO number is present, the process continues to the next task.  
    - **Sequence Flow:** Proceeds to Task 2b.

#### **Task 2b: Log Invoice into Accounting System**
- **Description:** The invoice is entered into the accounting system for tracking.  
- **Performed by:** Accounts Payable Clerk.  
- **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice (input), Accounting System (system artifact; e.g., database entry created).  
- **Sequence Flow:** Follows the "Yes" path from the PO gateway.

#### **Task 3: Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Confirmation**
- **Description:** The invoice is sent to the Purchasing department for verification that the goods or services were received and that details match the PO.  
- **Performed by:** Accounts Payable Clerk.  
- **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice (data object, forwarded via email or system notification), PO (referenced for matching).  
- **Sequence Flow:** Occurs after logging.

#### **Task 4: Confirm Receipt and Match Invoice to PO**
- **Description:** The Purchasing Officer reviews the invoice against the PO to confirm receipt of goods/services and check for accuracy in quantities, prices, and other details.  
- **Performed by:** Purchasing Officer (e.g., Dan).  
- **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice, PO (both data objects used for comparison).  
- **Sequence Flow:** Follows forwarding from Accounts Payable.

#### **Exclusive Gateway: Discrepancy Found?**
- **Description:** A decision point to check for any mismatches, such as incorrect pricing, missing items, or extra charges. If discrepancies exist, the process branches to resolution; if not, it proceeds to managerial approval.  
- **Conditions:**
  - **No Path (No Discrepancy):** If everything matches, the invoice is sent to the Department Manager for approval.  
    - **Sequence Flow:** Proceeds to Task 5.
  - **Yes Path (Discrepancy Found):** If discrepancies are identified, the process enters a resolution phase, which may involve rework or escalation.  
    - **Task 5a: Resolve Discrepancy**  
      - **Description:** The Purchasing Officer or Accounts Payable Clerk contacts the supplier for clarification. If the issue persists, it may be escalated to the Accounts Payable Supervisor or Supplier Relationship Manager. Resolution could include requesting a corrected invoice, checking contracts, or deciding on rejection.  
      - **Performed by:** Purchasing Officer (initially), Accounts Payable Clerk, Accounts Payable Supervisor (e.g., Rita for escalations), or Supplier Relationship Manager (e.g., Karen for supplier communication).  
      - **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice, PO, Email notifications or contract documents (data objects).  
      - **Exceptions/Variations:** This step may involve a rework loop, where the process returns to Task 4 (Confirm Receipt and Match) after resolution. Escalation occurs if the discrepancy cannot be resolved easily (e.g., to Rita or Karen). Uncertainty exists in the exact sequence, as accounts vary: Dan focuses on contacting the supplier, while Karen and Rita emphasize their roles in complex cases.  
      - **Sequence Flow:** After resolution, the process loops back to the Discrepancy Gateway or proceeds to Task 5 if cleared.

#### **Task 5: Send to Department Manager for Approval**
- **Description:** The invoice is forwarded to the Department Manager for final review and approval, typically via an automated system notification.  
- **Performed by:** System (automated), triggered by Accounts Payable or Purchasing.  
- **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice, PO, and confirmation details (data objects displayed in the system for review).  
- **Sequence Flow:** Follows the "No" path from the Discrepancy Gateway or after discrepancy resolution.

#### **Task 6: Manager Approval**
- **Description:** The Department Manager reviews the invoice details, PO, and confirmation. They approve if everything is correct or reject if issues are found (e.g., budget overruns or suspicious items).  
- **Performed by:** Department Manager (e.g., Carlos).  
- **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice, PO (reviewed in the system).  
- **Sequence Flow:** Occurs after forwarding.

#### **Exclusive Gateway: Approved?**
- **Description:** A decision point based on the manager's review. If approved, the invoice moves to payment scheduling; if rejected, it is handled for further investigation.  
- **Conditions:**
  - **Yes Path (Approved):** If the manager approves, the invoice is scheduled for payment.  
    - **Task 7: Schedule for Payment**  
      - **Description:** The Accounts Payable Clerk adds the invoice to the payment cycle.  
      - **Performed by:** Accounts Payable Clerk.  
      - **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice (updated in system), Payment Schedule (output data object).  
      - **Sequence Flow:** Leads to the end event.
    - **End Event: Payment Scheduled**  
      - **Description:** The process ends with the invoice ready for payment.
  - **No Path (Rejected):** If the manager rejects the invoice, it is sent back for investigation or held.  
    - **Task 7a: Reject and Investigate**  
      - **Description:** The Department Manager or Accounts Payable Clerk investigates the issue, which may involve escalating to the Accounts Payable Supervisor or contacting the supplier. This could lead to a rework loop back to earlier steps (e.g., discrepancy resolution).  
      - **Performed by:** Department Manager (initially), Accounts Payable Clerk, or Accounts Payable Supervisor.  
      - **Artifacts Involved:** Invoice (flagged), Rejection Notification (data object).  
      - **Exceptions/Variations:** Rejection is rare (e.g., once every couple of months per Carlos) and may result in the invoice being returned to Purchasing or Supplier Relationship Manager for further action. After investigation, the process might loop back to Task 4 or end in rejection.  
      - **End Event (for this path):** Invoice Rejected  
        - **Description:** The process ends if the invoice is ultimately rejected.

#### **End Events**
- **Payment Scheduled:** Standard end for approved invoices.
- **Invoice Returned or Rejected:** Ends for invoices without PO or with unresolvable issues.
- **Note on End States:** The process may not always have a clean end; rework loops (e.g., after discrepancy resolution) could restart the flow, but each instance is assumed to terminate when payment is scheduled or the invoice is rejected.

#### **Key Notes on Ambiguities and Variations**
- **Consolidation of Conflicting Accounts:** The core flow is consistent across interviews, but variations exist in exception handling. For instance, invoices without a PO are typically sent back (per Mary and Dan), but Rita's account suggests internal handling for informal cases, introducing uncertainty. I have represented this as a conditional path with a note.
- **Rework Loops and Escalations:** Discrepancy resolution and manager rejections may involve loops back to earlier tasks, but the exact triggers and sequences are not fully detailed in the interviews. These are modeled as gateways with descriptive tasks.
- **Roles and Collaboration:** Multiple roles interact, especially in exceptions (e.g., Karen's indirect involvement). This is captured in task assignments, but the process is primarily driven by Accounts Payable and Purchasing.
- **Artifacts and Data Flow:** Invoices and POs are central artifacts, with emails and system notifications facilitating handoffs. No parallel flows were indicated, so the model remains sequential with exclusive gateways.
- **Overall Coherence:** This model reflects a standard process with clear decision points, while noting exceptions to maintain fidelity to the empirical data. It should be adaptable for visual BPMN diagramming, with elements like gateways and tasks clearly defined.
