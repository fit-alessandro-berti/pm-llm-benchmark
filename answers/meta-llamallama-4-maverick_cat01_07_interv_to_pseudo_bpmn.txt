**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

### Process Overview

The invoice approval process begins when an invoice is received by the Accounts Payable department. The process involves several roles: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Department Manager (Carlos), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), and Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen).

### Activities/Tasks

1. **Receive Invoice**: Accounts Payable Clerk receives the invoice via email.
2. **Check PO Number**: Verify if the invoice is associated with a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
3. **Log Invoice**: If the PO number is valid, log the invoice into the accounting system.
4. **Request PO Details**: If the PO number is missing or invalid, request the supplier to provide more details.
5. **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**: Purchasing Officer confirms that the goods or services were received as per the PO.
6. **Match Invoice to PO**: Accounts Payable Clerk matches the invoice line items against the PO in the system.
7. **Resolve Discrepancies**: If discrepancies are found, Accounts Payable Clerk or Purchasing Officer coordinates with the supplier to resolve them.
8. **Escalate Exception**: If discrepancies cannot be resolved easily, escalate the issue to the Accounts Payable Supervisor.
9. **Approve Invoice**: Department Manager approves the invoice after confirmation from Purchasing.
10. **Schedule Payment**: Accounts Payable Clerk schedules the payment after managerial approval.
11. **Create Retrospective PO**: In cases where an invoice is received without a corresponding PO, create a retrospective PO with the department head's approval.

### Sequence Flow

1. **Receive Invoice**  **Check PO Number**
2. **Check PO Number**  **Request PO Details** (if PO number is missing/invalid)
3. **Check PO Number**  **Log Invoice** (if PO number is valid)
4. **Log Invoice**  **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**
5. **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**  **Match Invoice to PO**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**  **Approve Invoice** (if matches)
7. **Match Invoice to PO**  **Resolve Discrepancies** (if discrepancies found)
8. **Resolve Discrepancies**  **Escalate Exception** (if cannot be resolved)
9. **Escalate Exception**  **Create Retrospective PO or Reject Invoice** (under supervision of Accounts Payable Supervisor)
10. **Approve Invoice**  **Schedule Payment**

### Gateways/Decision Points

1. **PO Number Check**: If the invoice has a valid PO number, proceed to log the invoice; otherwise, request more details from the supplier.
2. **Invoice Matching**: If the invoice matches the PO, send it for approval; if not, resolve discrepancies or escalate.
3. **Discrepancy Resolution**: If discrepancies are resolved, continue with the approval process; if not, escalate to supervisor.
4. **Managerial Approval**: If the manager approves, schedule the payment; if not, the invoice is either rejected or put on hold.

### Roles/Participants

- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**: Receives and logs invoices, matches invoices to POs, and schedules payments.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**: Confirms receipt of goods/services and coordinates with suppliers on discrepancies.
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**: Approves invoices after confirmation from Purchasing.
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**: Handles exceptions, coordinates between departments, and ensures problem invoices are resolved.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**: Assists in resolving issues with suppliers.

### Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs

- **Invoice**: The document received from suppliers that initiates the process.
- **Purchase Order (PO)**: The document against which invoices are matched.
- **Confirmation Email**: Sent by Purchasing to Accounts Payable after verifying receipt of goods/services.
- **Retrospective PO**: Created in cases where an invoice is received without a corresponding PO.

### Exceptions/Variations

- **Missing PO Number**: If an invoice is received without a PO number, the process involves requesting more details from the supplier or creating a retrospective PO.
- **Discrepancies in Invoice**: If there are discrepancies between the invoice and PO, the process involves resolving these discrepancies, potentially escalating to the supervisor.
- **Informal Contracts**: Invoices for services contracted informally may require a retrospective PO or special approval.

### Notes on Uncertainty/Ambiguity

- The exact steps and decisions made during discrepancy resolution and exception handling can vary based on the specific circumstances and the judgment of the personnel involved.
- The involvement of the Supplier Relationship Manager is indirect and based on the need for supplier coordination.
