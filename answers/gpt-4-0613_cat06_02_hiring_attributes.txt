Sensitive attributes for fairness in this context could be 'case:citizen', 'case:gender', 'case:german speaking', and 'case:religious'. These attributes are potentially sensitive because they contain personal information that can be used to discriminate against individuals. Making decisions based on these attributes could lead to biased outcomes and violate principles of fairness and equality. 

Attribute 'case:citizen': This attribute specifies whether the candidate is a citizen. Using this attribute for decision making might result in discrimination against non-citizens. 

Attribute 'case:gender': This attribute specifies the gender of the candidate. Using this attribute for making hiring decisions may lead to gender bias. 

Attribute 'case:german speaking': This attribute specifies whether the candidate speaks German. Using this for selection might be discriminatory against non-German speakers unless the role demands it.

Attribute 'case:religious': This attribute specifies the religious inclination of the candidate. Using this attribute might result in religious discrimination. 

Therefore, care must be taken to ensure these attributes are not used to unfairly discriminate applicants during the hiring process. Fairness here means providing equal opportunity to all candidates, irrespective of their personal attributes.
