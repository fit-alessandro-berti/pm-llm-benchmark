**Explanation (high-level):**

- The root is a `+` (parallel) between two main branches:
  1. **Direct path (no RMI):** RA  VF (optional)  AE  AD  SC  AC  
     (The VF can be present before or after RMI, but in this branch, it's not repeated.)
  2. **With RMI loop path:** RA  RMI  (optionally re-VF)  AE  AD (with SC  AC)  
     The RMI is in a loop: after RMI, you can validate again (re-VF), then continue to approval.  
     The loop exits after AD is reached.

- The RMI loop is modeled using `* ( ... )` where after each RMI, you either proceed to AD (after possible re-validation) or go back to RMI.

- The use of `XOR` allows for the presence or absence of re-validation after RMI (you either do it or not).

- All activities are leaves labeled appropriately.

This model is simple enough for interpretation, precise in capturing the observed repetitions and choices, and reflects the main flow of the process as observed in the log.
