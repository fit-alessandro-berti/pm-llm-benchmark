This diagram is a **business process/workflow model** that illustrates how a particular request-handling process is structured. It shows the activities (tasks) that can happen, the order or branching in which they occur, and how they eventually converge to an end point. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the main elements:

---

## 1. Main Process Flow

1. **Activities (labeled boxes)**  
   - Each rounded box (e.g., “register request,” “examine thoroughly,” “decide,” etc.) represents a **task** or **activity** in the process.  
   - For example:  
     - **a: “register request”** – The process starts with registering the request.  
     - **b: “examine thoroughly”**  
     - **c: “examine casually”**  
     - **d: “check ticket”**  
     - **f: “reinitiate request”** – Notice this can loop back to “register request.”  
     - **e: “decide”**  
     - **g: “pay compensation”**  
     - **x: “reject request”**  
     - **z: “end”** – The process ends here.

2. **Flow Arrows (edges)**  
   - The arrows indicate **the sequence or possible transitions** between activities.  
   - You can see there is a loop involving the tasks **b, c, d, f** (the “examine” steps and reinitiation). This means the request can be examined in different ways and possibly reinitiated multiple times before moving on.

3. **Decision Point (“decide”)**  
   - After the examinations are complete, the process reaches the **“decide”** activity (labeled **e**).  
   - From there, it branches to either **“pay compensation”** (g) or **“reject request”** (x).  
   - Ultimately, both paths converge toward the **“end”** (z).

## 2. Gateway Notation (the legend)

In the bottom-right corner, you see a small legend describing typical **split and join gateways** in workflow or process-modeling notations:

- **XOR-split / XOR-join** – An exclusive decision or merge (only one path is taken/merged).  
- **AND-split / AND-join** – A parallel split or merge (all paths are taken or synchronized).  
- **OR-split / OR-join** – A conditional split or merge (one or more paths might be taken, and you join only the paths that were actually active).

These gateways help clarify **how** branching and merging of the process flow should occur. In the main diagram, the looping and branching among **b, c, d, f** could be seen as different kinds of splits/joins depending on the underlying rules.

## 3. Overall Interpretation

- The diagram shows that once a request is **registered** (activity a), it can go through various levels of examination (thorough, casual, check ticket) in any order or combination, potentially looping back if needed.  
- Eventually, there is a **decision** (activity e) about the outcome: either **compensate** (g) or **reject** (x).  
- Both of these outcomes lead to the final **end** (z).

Hence, the visualization captures **all possible paths** from the start of the process (register request) to the end (process concluded), including loops, multiple types of examination, and a final decision with two possible outcomes.
