```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 6
    )
);
```

###  Explanation:

- **Inner Query**:  
  Groups events by `case_id` and counts the number of events per case using `COUNT(*)`.  
  The `HAVING COUNT(*) > 6` filters out only those `case_id`s that have **more than six events**.

- **Outer Query**:  
  Selects all rows from `event_log` where the `case_id` is **not** in the list of cases with more than six events.

This ensures that only events from cases with **six or fewer events** are returned.

### Alternative (More Explicit & Safe) Version (Avoids `NOT IN` with NULLs):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
    )
);
```

>  This version is often preferred in production because:
> - It avoids potential issues with `NOT IN` when the subquery returns `NULL` (though in this case, no `NULL` case_id would be produced).
> - It's more readable and logically clearer: "select only events from cases with 6 events".

---

### Final Recommendation:

Use the **second version** for clarity, correctness, and robustness:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
    )
);
```  **Recommended Benchmark Query**.
