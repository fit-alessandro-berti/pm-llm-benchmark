Here's a **DuckDB SQL query** that fulfills all the requirements outlined in your prompt. This query:

1. Extracts the **ordered sequence of activities per case** using `ARRAY_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp`.
2. Groups by the **activity sequence** to identify **unique process variants**.
3. Counts how many cases belong to each variant.
4. Filters to return only the **top K variants** based on frequency.
5. Returns **all events** from the original `event_log` that belong to those top K variants.

###  Final Query:

```sql
WITH ordered_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM
        ordered_sequences
    GROUP BY
        activity_sequence
),

top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM
        variant_counts
    ORDER BY
        variant_count DESC
    LIMIT :k  -- Replace :k with your desired value of K
)

SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
WHERE
    el.case_id IN (
        SELECT
            os.case_id
        FROM
            ordered_sequences os
        WHERE
            os.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
    );
```

###  Explanation:

- **`ordered_sequences`**: For each `case_id`, we create a list (array) of activities ordered by `timestamp`.
- **`variant_counts`**: Counts how many cases have the same activity sequence.
- **`top_k_variants`**: Selects the top K most frequent variants.
- **Final `SELECT`**: Returns all events from the original `event_log` where the `case_id` corresponds to one of the top K variants.

---

###  Notes:

- Replace `:k` with the desired value of `K` (e.g., `LIMIT 5` for top 5 variants).
- This query assumes that the `activity` and `timestamp` columns are correctly populated and that `case_id` uniquely identifies a process instance.

Let me know if you want this as a stored procedure or if you'd like to include additional metadata like the variant name or its frequency in the output.
