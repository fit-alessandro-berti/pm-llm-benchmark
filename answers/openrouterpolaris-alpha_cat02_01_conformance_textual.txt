Here’s a concise, rule-based evaluation of each case.

First, interpret the normative description into concrete constraints (most strict, but consistent with the text):

Main structural rules:
1) Start:
   - The first event must be: Receive order.
2) Inventory before decisions:
   - Check inventory must occur after Receive order and before:
     - Authorize payment
     - Package items
     - Cancel order
     - Ship order
3) Two valid scenario patterns:

   a) Fulfillment (sufficient inventory):
      - Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close
      - Constraints:
        - Authorize payment only after Check.
        - Package items only after Authorize payment and before Ship.
        - Ship only after Package items.
        - No Cancel order in this path.
        - Close order is last.

   b) Cancellation (insufficient inventory):
      - Receive  Check  Cancel order  Close
      - Constraints:
        - Cancel only after Check.
        - No Authorize payment, Package items, or Ship after Cancel.
        - Close order is last.

4) General:
   - Close order must be the final activity.
   - Ship order must never occur after Cancel order.
   - Payment should not be authorized if the order ends in the cancel path (strongly implied “must branch”).

Now apply these to each case.

Case 1:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close
- All constraints satisfied:
  - Correct start.
  - Inventory checked before authorization.
  - Authorization before packaging.
  - Packaging before shipping.
  - No cancel in fulfillment scenario.
  - Close is final.
Conclusion: Case 1 is compliant.

Case 2:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close
Violations:
- “Package items” only after authorization:
  - Norm: Package items should only occur after Authorize payment.
  - Here, Package items occurs before Authorize payment.
- Process logic: They prepared items prior to confirming payment, contrary to description.
Conclusion: Case 2 violates the normative process.

Case 3:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close
Violations:
- Mixed branches:
  - After Check, they Authorized payment, then Cancelled.
  - Normative description: If inventory insufficient  branch to Cancel; if sufficient  proceed to fulfillment.
    - Once Cancel order is executed, it is “illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment.”
- Ship after cancel:
  - Norm: Ship order should never occur after a cancellation.
  - Here, Ship order occurs after Cancel order.
- Also, authorizing payment for an order that ends canceled conflicts with the intended “branching” logic (payment authorization is meant for the fulfillment path).
Conclusion: Case 3 violates the normative process (multiple violations).

Case 4:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close
- Matches the cancellation scenario exactly:
  - Check before Cancel.
  - No fulfillment activities after Cancel.
  - Close is final.
Conclusion: Case 4 is compliant.

Case 5:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close
Violations:
- Missing packaging step in fulfillment path:
  - Norm: Package items should occur after authorization and before shipping.
  - Here, Ship order happens directly after Authorize payment with no Package items.
Conclusion: Case 5 violates the normative process.

Final answer:

- Compliant cases:
  - Case 1
  - Case 4

- Non-compliant cases:
  - Case 2: Packaged before payment authorization.
  - Case 3: Authorized then canceled; shipped after cancellation; mixes cancel and fulfillment paths.
  - Case 5: Shipped without prior packaging step.
