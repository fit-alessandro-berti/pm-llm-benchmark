 The BPMN 2.0 XML provided defines a process model with several tasks. Here is the list of tasks within the process model, along with their respective `id` attributes and names:

1. `idb86a1356-bb12-4a45-b1a3-d430cf587b6b` - Task name: "decide"
2. `idd3814e0c-ae8b-41d6-b7a1-7c0e9385eb3e` - Task name: "pay compensation"
3. `id8c2e27f2-838e-47e7-9506-1387d1d642eb` - Task name: "check ticket"
4. `id1c963927-0fbe-4028-9d31-536a6e5362a9` - Task name: "examine casually"
5. `id3a2e2f29-0e15-4dca-9602-6f8929a0dbcb` - Task name: "register request"
6. `idfe1bd2a5-fb67-4a1a-b520-d7d02ee587e7` - Task name: "reject request"
7. `idc5b9256f-0a5c-43f7-9877-8a7d17977ee2` - Task name: "examine thoroughly"
8. `id25fcead3-d54b-47a1-b9dc-5ac5df8a31db` - Task name: "reinitiate request"

These tasks are part of the process flow, which also includes start events, end events, exclusive gates, parallel gates, and sequence flows that define the order of execution and the paths that the process can take.
