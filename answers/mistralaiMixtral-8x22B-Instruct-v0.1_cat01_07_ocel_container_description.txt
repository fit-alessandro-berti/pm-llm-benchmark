 Based on the provided object-centric event log, here is a description of the main processes for each object type:

1. Handling Unit:
   - The process begins with "Collect Goods" and directly follows with "Load Truck" for all handling units.

2. Truck:
   - For most trucks, "Load Truck" follows "Load Truck" repeated times (frequency = 8559), indicating loading operations at various stages or locations.
   - After loading, some trucks proceed to "Drive to Terminal" (frequency = 1989).
   - The "Drive to Terminal" activity is sometimes followed by "Load Truck" again (frequency = 1988), suggesting further loading tasks at the terminal.

3. Container:
   - The process for containers shares some similarities with that of trucks, as "Load Truck" follows "Load Truck" for container loading tasks too.
   - "Order Empty Containers" is followed by "Pick Up Empty Container" and then "Load Truck".
   - Following the terminal arrival, containers go through additional activities like "Weigh", "Place in Stock", and "Bring to Loading Bay" before they are finally loaded onto a vehicle.

4. Vehicle:
   - For vehicles, "Load to Vehicle" activities follow each other (frequency = 1827), indicating continuous loading tasks.
   - Vehicles are also booked through "Book Vehicles", and eventually, they depart after all loading tasks are completed.
   - The process may involve rescheduling containers and vehicle bookings.

5. Forklift:
   - The process for forklifts consists of moving containers between different activities like "Bring to Loading Bay", "Load to Vehicle", "Weigh", and "Place in Stock".

6. Customer Order:
   - Customer orders are registered and then transport documents are created for them.

7. Transport Document:
   - Transport documents are created, vehicles are booked, empty containers are ordered, and finally, the transport process starts with "Depart".
   - This process may also involve container rescheduling.
