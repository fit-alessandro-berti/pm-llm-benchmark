Here's a breakdown of the analysis, identifying long-running cases, potential causes, and recommendations:

**1. Identifying Long-Running Cases:**

First, let's calculate the total resolution time for each case:

*   **Case 101:** 2 hours, 15 minutes (8:00 - 10:15)
*   **Case 102:** 25 hours, 10 minutes (8:05 - next day 9:15)
*   **Case 103:** 1 hour, 20 minutes (8:10 - 9:30)
*   **Case 104:** 24 hours, 10 minutes (8:20 - next day 8:30)
*   **Case 105:** 49 hours, 5 minutes (8:25 - two days later 9:30)

Based on this, **Cases 102, 104, and 105** are significantly longer than Cases 101 and 103. They stand out as taking a full day or even two, while the others are resolved within a couple of hours.

**2. Determining Potential Root Causes:**

Let's examine the activities and timings within the long-running cases:

*   **Case 102:**
    *   Noticeable delay (2.5 hours) between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent".
    *   Significant delay (19 hours) from "Investigate issue" at 2 pm to "Resolve Ticket" the next day. This indicates a likely overnight delay.
    *   **Key Issue:** Escalation and potential overnight delay in resolution by Level-2.

*   **Case 104:**
    *   Long delay (3.5 hours) between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and the start of "Investigate Issue."
    *   Overnight delay (19 hours) between first investigation, and resolution of ticket.
    *   **Key Issue:** Significant delay before the Level-1 agent begins investigating, combined with an overnight delay.

*   **Case 105:**
    * Very short delay (10 mins) between "Assign to Level-1 agent" and "investigate issue"
    *   A short investigation, but it ends with escalation
    *   A very long time (29 hours) between the escalation, and the Level-2 agent starting to investigate.
    * Another long time (19 hours) between "Investigate Issue" to "Resolve Ticket."
    *   **Key Issue:** Very significant delay after escalation and the level 2 agent starting the investigation, combined with another delay before resolution.

**General Patterns and Root Causes:**

*   **Escalation Delays:** Cases involving escalation (102 and 105) take considerably longer. This points to a bottleneck in the Level-2 support process. The time between escalation and Level-2 actually starting to investigate is a critical issue.
*   **Investigation Delays (Level-1):** Case 104 shows a significant delay before the Level-1 agent even *begins* investigating.  This suggests potential issues with workload management, prioritization, or agent availability at Level-1.
*   **Overnight Delays:** All prolonged cases span multiple days, suggesting issues with after-hours support or handover processes. The consistent 19-hour gaps between the start of investigations and the final resolution on the next day are very strong indicators of this.

**3. Explanation and Recommendations:**

*   **Escalation Bottleneck (Level-2):**  The Level-2 team may be understaffed, overwhelmed with a backlog of escalated tickets, lacking clear prioritization rules for escalated issues, or lacking necessary tools/resources.

    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Resource Allocation:** Evaluate the workload and staffing of the Level-2 team. Consider adding more agents or providing additional training.
        *   **Prioritization:** Implement a clear and strict prioritization system for escalated tickets, perhaps based on severity or impact.
        *   **SLA Monitoring:** Introduce Service Level Agreements (SLAs) specifically for escalated tickets, with alerts for potential breaches.
        *   **Knowledge Transfer:**  Investigate why so many tickets are being escalated.  If Level-1 agents can be trained to handle some of these issues, it will reduce the burden on Level-2.
        * **On-call system:** Some form of support should be available, or at least on-call, during off hours.

*   **Level-1 Investigation Delays:** The delay before Level-1 agents start investigating suggests problems with how tickets are assigned or how agents manage their queues.

    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Automated Assignment:**  Consider an automated ticket assignment system that distributes tickets based on agent availability and skill set.
        *   **Workload Balancing:** Implement mechanisms to prevent agents from becoming overloaded, ensuring a more even distribution of tickets.
        *   **Real-time Monitoring:**  Provide supervisors with real-time dashboards to monitor agent workload and ticket queues, allowing for proactive intervention.
        *   **Clearer Triage:** The triage process might need refinement to better identify the complexity of tickets upfront, ensuring they are routed to the appropriate level (Level-1 or Level-2) more accurately.

* **Overnight Delays:**
    * **Recommendations:**
        * Examine options to reduce this delay, including:
            * After hours support.
            * A well defined handover process.
            * An on-call system.

By addressing these identified bottlenecks, the customer support ticket resolution process can be significantly optimized, leading to faster resolution times and improved customer satisfaction.
