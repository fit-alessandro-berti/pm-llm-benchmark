Of course. Here is the integrated event log generated from the provided ERP data tables.

### Assumptions and Design Choices

Before presenting the log, here are the key assumptions and design choices made during the data integration process:

1.  **Case ID**: As requested, `order_id` is used as the unique `Case ID` to trace each process instance from start to finish.
2.  **Granularity of Events**:
    *   **Item Picking**: Each row in the `Order Lines` table is treated as a separate `Item Picked` event. This provides a granular view of the warehouse operations, showing that multiple items for the same order can be picked by different people at different times.
    *   **Delivery**: Each row in the `Delivery` table generates two distinct events: `Order Dispatched` (using `delivery_dispatch_date`) and `Order Arrived` (using `delivery_arrival_date`). This correctly models the duration of the shipping activity.
    *   **Multiple Records**: Cases with multiple deliveries, invoices, or payments (e.g., Order 1002) will have corresponding multiple events in the log, accurately reflecting process variations like split shipments and partial payments.
3.  **Resource Mapping**: The `Resource` column is populated by joining the ID fields (`sales_person_id`, `picker_id`, `carrier_id`, `billing_person_id`) with the `Resources` table to get the full name. For the `Payment Received` event, no direct resource is available, so the field is left empty.
4.  **Attribute Enrichment**:
    *   **Case Attributes**: Attributes from the `Orders` table (`customer_type`, `order_priority`) are treated as case-level attributes and are included in every event row for that case to provide context.
    *   **Event Attributes**: Attributes specific to an event (e.g., `invoice_id`, `invoice_amount`, `item_id`, `quantity`) are included only in the rows for their corresponding events.
5.  **Incomplete Traces**: The log includes all available events for every case. For example, Order 1004 is an incomplete process in the given data, and the log reflects this by only showing the `Order Created` and `Item Picked` events.

### Final Event Log

The following table is the comprehensive event log, sorted by `Case ID` and then chronologically by `Timestamp`.
