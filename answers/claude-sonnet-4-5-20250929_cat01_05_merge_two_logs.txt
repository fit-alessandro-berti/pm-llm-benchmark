# Merged Event Log Analysis and Integration

## Matching Strategy

I will use the following approach:
1. **Timestamp tolerance**: ±2 seconds for matching events
2. **Event name mapping**: Identify semantically equivalent events despite naming differences
3. **Primary timestamp**: Use Log A timestamp as primary (System A timeline)
4. **Attribute enrichment**: Combine all attributes from both logs for matched events

## Event Name Mapping Analysis

| Log A Event | Log B Event | Semantic Match? | Timestamp Diff |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Order Received | OrderReceived |  Yes | 2 sec |
| Order Validated | OrderValidation |  Yes | 1 sec |
| Payment Processed | PaymentCheck |  Yes | 5 sec |
| Item Shipped | Shipping |  Yes | 2 sec |
| Item Delivered | (none) |  No match | N/A |
| (none) | Quality Check |  No match | N/A |

## Matching Decisions

### Event 1: Order Received / OrderReceived
- **Match**: YES
- **Reasoning**: Names are semantically identical, timestamp difference is 2 seconds (within tolerance)
- **Timestamp selected**: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z (Log A - primary)

### Event 2: Order Validated / OrderValidation
- **Match**: YES
- **Reasoning**: Clear semantic equivalence, timestamp difference is 1 second (within tolerance)
- **Timestamp selected**: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z (Log A - primary)

### Event 3: Payment Processed / PaymentCheck
- **Match**: YES (with caveat)
- **Reasoning**: Despite 5-second difference (exceeds strict 2-second tolerance), these are semantically the same event. Log B notes mention "Payment gateway delay" which explains the offset. No other payment events exist, so this is clearly the same business event.
- **Timestamp selected**: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z (Log A - primary)

### Event 4: Quality Check (Log B only)
- **Match**: NO
- **Reasoning**: This event appears only in Log B at 10:03:00Z. No corresponding event in Log A. This represents additional process detail captured by System B.
- **Action**: Include as standalone event with Log B attributes only

### Event 5: Item Shipped / Shipping
- **Match**: YES
- **Reasoning**: Semantically equivalent, timestamp difference is 2 seconds (at tolerance boundary)
- **Timestamp selected**: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z (Log A - primary)

### Event 6: Item Delivered (Log A only)
- **Match**: NO
- **Reasoning**: No corresponding event in Log B. System B may not track final delivery.
- **Action**: Include as standalone event with Log A attributes only

[Event 3 - MERGED]
timestamp_primary: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z
timestamp_system_b: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z

[Event 5 - MERGED]

## Summary Statistics

- **Total events in merged log**: 6
- **Merged events**: 4 (67%)
- **System A only events**: 1 (17%)
- **System B only events**: 1 (17%)
- **Average timestamp difference for merged events**: 2.5 seconds

## Key Insights

1. **System B provides richer context**: Every matched event from System B includes user_id, resource_id, and descriptive notes that enhance process understanding.

2. **Payment event timing discrepancy**: The 5-second gap between payment events suggests System A records the initiation while System B records completion, consistent with the "gateway delay" note.

3. **Process coverage differences**: 
   - System B captures operational detail (Quality Check) not visible to System A
   - System A tracks customer-facing completion (Item Delivered) not captured by System B

4. **Timestamp patterns**: System B consistently records events 1-2 seconds earlier, suggesting it captures events at initiation while System A records at completion/acknowledgment.

This merged log provides a more complete view of the order fulfillment process than either system alone.
