<think>
First, I need to understand the event log. There are three cases:

- Case 1: RA -> VF -> AE -> RMI -> VF -> AD -> SC -> AC

- Case 2: RA -> VF -> AE -> AD -> SC -> AC

- Case 3: RA -> VF -> AE -> RMI -> RMI -> VF -> AD -> SC -> AC

From this, I see that the process starts with RA, VF, AE. Then, there might be zero or more occurrences of RMI and VF. After that, it goes to AD, SC, AC.

In Case 1, after AE, there's RMI then VF, then AD. In Case 2, no RMI or extra VF, directly to AD. In Case 3, after AE, two RMI and then VF, then AD.

So the loop involves RMI and VF. But in the sequence, RMI is followed by VF, and this can happen multiple times or not at all.

Looking at the operators:

- -> for sequence

- X for exclusive choice

- + for parallel

- * for loop

The loop operator * (A, B) means A is executed, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

In this case, the loop seems to be around requesting missing info and re-validating the form.

Perhaps A is the body that is repeated, and B is the option to loop back.

In the description: * (A, B) - A is executed, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

So for example, * (A, B) could mean: do A, then choose to stop or do B and then A again.

But in our case, the loop involves multiple RMI and then VF.

In Case 3, it's AE -> RMI -> RMI -> VF -> AD

After AE, there can be multiple RMI, and then a VF, and this block can be repeated or not.

In Case 1: after AE, one RMI and one VF.

In Case 2: no RMI or VF, directly to AD.

In Case 3: after AE, two RMI and one VF.

But in Case 1 and 3, there's a VF after the RMI(s), but in the initial part, there's already a VF before AE.

Let's list the traces clearly:

Trace 1: RA, VF, AE, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC

Trace 2: RA, VF, AE, AD, SC, AC

Trace 3: RA, VF, AE, RMI, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC

So, after RA and VF and AE, there might be a loop that includes RMI and possibly multiple RMI, but in the traces, RMI is always followed by VF eventually, but in Trace 3, there are two RMI before VF.

In Trace 3, it's RMI, RMI, VF – so multiple RMI can happen before a VF.

But VF might be the action that re-validates after missing info is requested.

Perhaps the loop is structured such that after AE, there can be a loop where you can request missing info (RMI), and after some RMI, you do VF, and then decide to loop back or not.

But in the loop operator * (A, B), it's A then optionally B and A again.

Here, A and B need to be subtrees.

Maybe I need to model the part after AE as a loop.

Let me think about what A and B could be.

Perhaps the loop body includes RMI and the decision.

Since there can be multiple RMI before a VF, maybe RMI can be repeated, and then VF is done.

But in the process tree operators, we have sequence, choice, parallel, loop.

The loop operator is specific: * (A, B) - do A, then either exit or do B and A again.

In standard process mining, loops are often modeled with a do-part and a redo-part.

In this case, perhaps after AE, there is a loop where A is, say, the validation or something.

Let's identify the common parts.

All traces have: RA -> VF -> AE -> [optional loop] -> AD -> SC -> AC

The optional loop involves RMI and VF.

In the loop, it seems that RMI can occur multiple times, and then VF is done, and after VF, it might loop back or go to AD.

In Trace 1: after AE, RMI, VF, then AD – so one iteration.

In Trace 2: no loop, directly AD.

In Trace 3: after AE, RMI, RMI, VF, then AD – so multiple RMI before VF.

The multiple RMI suggest that RMI itself might be repeatable, or perhaps the loop allows multiple executions.

But in the given loop operator * (A, B), it's not directly supporting multiple executions of B or something.

Let's read the loop operator again: * (A, B) - A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again (this can happen several times until the loop is exited).

So, for example, * (A, B) could be: do A, then if continue, do B and A, then if continue, do B and A, etc., until exit.

The sequence is A, (B A)*, optional B or something? No: after A, either exit or do B and then back to after A, I think.

From the description: A is executed, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

So the possible executions: A then exit, or A then B then A then exit, or A then B then A then B then A then exit, etc.

So the traces for * (A, B) are: A, or A B A, or A B A B A, etc. Always ending with A, and B can be between A's.

In our case, for the loop part, in Trace 1: RMI VF

In Trace 3: RMI RMI VF

But in the loop operator, if I set A to VF and B to RMI, then * (VF, RMI) would give traces: VF, or VF RMI VF, or VF RMI VF RMI VF, etc.

But in the log, when the loop happens, it starts with RMI, not VF.

In Trace 1: after AE, RMI then VF

In * (A, B), it starts with A.

If I set A to RMI, B to something.

* (RMI, B): traces RMI, or RMI B RMI, or RMI B RMI B RMI, etc.

But in the log, it ends with VF, and in Trace 1 it's RMI VF, which could be part of RMI then exit, but there's no B.

Perhaps I need to include VF in A or B.

Maybe the loop is * (something, something).

Another way: perhaps the loop body is RMI, and after RMI, you can choose to do VF and loop back or do VF and exit.

But the operator doesn't directly support that.

Perhaps I can model it as a sequence with a loop.

Let's think differently.

Perhaps after AE, there is an optional loop that consists of RMI followed by VF, and this can be repeated.

In Trace 3, there are two RMI before one VF, so it's not RMI VF as a block.

Unless RMI can be executed multiple times before VF.

But in the process tree operators, I don't have a way to model arbitrary repetitions of a single activity easily, except through the loop operator.

With * (A, B), if I set A to RMI and B to epsilon or something, but there's no epsilon, only tau for silent steps.

The leafs can be activities or tau (silent steps).

Tau is a silent step, which doesn't produce an event.

Perhaps I can model the loop to allow multiple RMI.

For example, if I have * (tau, RMI), but that would be silent, then optionally RMI and silent again, which doesn't match.

Perhaps I can have a loop where A is RMI, and B is also RMI or something, but * (A, B) with A and B both RMI would give RMI, or RMI RMI RMI, etc., but it always ends with RMI, and in the log, after multiple RMI, there's a VF.

In the traces, after the RMI(s), there's always a VF before going to AD.

In cases with loop, it's one or more RMI followed by one VF.

In Trace 1: one RMI, one VF

Trace 3: two RMI, one VF

So the block is (RMI+ VF)? That is, one or more RMI followed by VF.

But in process tree, I need to model this with the given operators.

Perhaps I can model RMI as having a loop itself, but that might not be accurate.

Since the number of RMI can vary, but always followed by VF, and VF is also done at the beginning.

Another way: perhaps the VF after RMI is part of the loop.

Let's see the entire flow.

All traces have RA -> VF -> AE

Then, optionally, a block of RMI and VF.

Then AD -> SC -> AC.

In the optional part, when present, it's one or more RMI followed by VF.

But notice that VF is also done before AE, so it's like VF can be done multiple times, but the first VF is before AE, and the additional VF is after RMI.

In terms of sequence, it's fixed: RA -> VF -> AE, then [optional: (RMI VF)* or something], but in Trace 3, it's RMI RMI VF, which could be seen as (RMI VF) with multiple RMI, but it's not grouped.

Perhaps I can model the part after AE as a loop where the "do" part is RMI, and the "redo" part is to do RMI again or do VF.

But with the given loop operator, it's a bit tricky.

Let's recall the loop operator * (A, B): traces like A, or A B A, or A B A B A, etc.

If I set A to VF and B to RMI, traces: VF, or VF RMI VF, or VF RMI VF RMI VF, etc.

But in the log, when the loop happens, it starts with RMI, not VF. For example, after AE, RMI then VF.

So it doesn't match.

If I set A to RMI and B to VF, traces: RMI, or RMI VF RMI, or RMI VF RMI VF RMI, etc.

In Trace 1: RMI (and then exit, but it should be followed by VF in the log? No, in * (A, B), if you exit after A, you have just RMI, but in the log, when there's a loop, it's RMI VF for one iteration, but if you exit after A, you have only RMI, but in the process, after RMI, VF is always done before AD.

In the traces with loop, it's always RMI followed by VF, and for multiple RMI, it's multiple RMI then VF, which doesn't fit the * (A, B) pattern directly.

For Trace 3: RMI RMI VF – this could be seen as a sequence of RMI and then VF, but with RMI repeatable.

Perhaps I can model a subtree for the loop part.

Maybe use a parallel operator or choice, but that might not capture the order.

Another idea: after AE, there is an exclusive choice: either go directly to AD, or enter a loop that does RMI and then VF, and can loop back.

But the loop operator is for the tree, so perhaps I can have X ( -> (AD, ...), * (something, something) )

Let's think.

Perhaps the loop is * (VF, RMI), but as I said, it starts with VF.

But in the log, the optional part starts with RMI.

Unless I add a silent step or something.

Perhaps the structure is: after AE, there is a loop where you can choose to do RMI or to do VF and exit the loop.

But with exclusive choice inside the loop.

The loop operator * (A, B) is fixed.

I could model it as a sequence with a loop that has choice.

But I need to use the given operators.

Perhaps use the loop operator with A being a choice.

For example, * (A, B) where A is X (tau, RMI) or something, but it's getting complicated.

Let's think about the minimal model that fits the traces.

The part after AE can be: nothing, or RMI VF, or RMI RMI VF, etc.

So the language is { epsilon, (RMI)+ VF }

That is, zero or more RMI followed by VF, but only if there is at least one RMI, no: in Trace 2, nothing, in Trace 1, RMI VF, Trace 3, RMI RMI VF.

In Trace 2, it's empty, in others, one or more RMI followed by VF.

In Trace 2, no RMI and no VF, directly to AD.

In Trace 1 and 3, there is RMI and VF.

But there is already a VF before AE in all traces.

So the additional VF is only when there is RMI.

So after AE, the behavior is: either directly to AD (no additional activities), or do one or more RMI followed by VF, then to AD.

To model "one or more RMI followed by VF" with the process tree operators.

With the loop operator, if I want to model a repeatable sequence, it's a bit tricky.

I could model RMI as having a loop itself.

For example, for RMI, I can have a subtree that allows multiple executions.

But RMI is an activity, so if I make a subtree for the loop part.

Let's define a subtree for the optional part after AE.

Let me define a process tree node for the loop.

Suppose I have a loop * (A, B).

I want the traces for the loop part to be epsilon or RMI+ VF.

But with * (A, B), the traces always include at least A, unless I use choice.

Perhaps after AE, there is an exclusive choice: X ( -> (AD), L ), where L is a loop that does RMI and then VF, and can loop back.

But for L, if I use * (RMI, VF), then * (RMI, VF) has traces RMI, or RMI VF RMI, etc., but I need it to start with RMI and end with VF or something.

For * (RMI, VF), traces: RMI (exit), or RMI VF RMI (exit), or RMI VF RMI VF RMI, etc.

But in the log, for the loop part, when present, it's RMI...RMI VF, so it ends with VF, so I need to ensure that it doesn't exit after RMI without VF.

In * (RMI, VF), it can exit after RMI, giving just RMI, but in the log, when RMI is done, it's always followed by VF in that block.

In Trace 1: RMI VF

In Trace 3: RMI RMI VF

So no trace with just RMI or just VF in that part.

In * (RMI, VF), it can have "RMI" as a possible trace if exit after A, but in the log, "RMI" alone is not a valid completion; it's always followed by VF when present.

In * (RMI, VF), it can have "RMI VF RMI" etc., which has multiple RMI with VF in between, but in the log, in Trace 3, it's RMI RMI VF, no VF in between the RMI.

In * (RMI, VF), the trace "RMI VF RMI" has VF between RMI, but in the log, the VF is only at the end.

So it doesn't match.

For example, * (RMI, VF) could produce RMI VF RMI, which would be RMI, VF, RMI, but in the log, it's consecutive RMI then VF, no VF in between.

So that's not correct.

Perhaps I need a way to model a loop where RMI can be repeated, and then VF is done to exit.

With the given operators, perhaps I can use a sequence with a loop for RMI.

For example,  after AE, have X ( -> (AD), -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) ) or something.

Let's think.

Suppose I have a loop for RMI: * (RMI, tau) - this would give traces RMI, or RMI tau RMI, but tau is silent, so the visible traces are RMI (from A and exit), or RMI RMI (from A B A, but B is tau, so just A A, but since B is tau, it's silent, so traces RMI or RMI RMI or RMI RMI RMI, etc., always ending with RMI.

Then, if I have * (RMI, tau) followed by VF, then the traces would be (RMI+ ) VF, since * (RMI, tau) gives RMI+, and then VF.

And for the case with no loop, I can have an exclusive choice.

But * (RMI, tau) gives traces where RMI is executed one or more times, with silent steps, but the visible behavior is RMI repeated.

In * (A, B), with B=tau, traces: A (visible), or A B A (B silent, so A A), or A B A B A (A A A), etc.

Yes, so visible traces for * (RMI, tau) are RMI, RMI RMI, RMI RMI RMI, ..., so one or more RMI.

Then, if I have a sequence -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ), that would give traces RMI VF, RMI RMI VF, RMI RMI RMI VF, etc., which matches the loop part when present.

But in the case where there is no loop, like Trace 2, I need nothing.

So I can have after AE, an exclusive choice X ( nothing, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) )

But how to represent "nothing" in process tree? Probably using a silent step or an empty choice.

In process trees, for exclusive choice, if one child is tau or something.

Exclusive choice X (A, B) means either A or B is executed.

If I want a choice between doing nothing or doing the loop part.

"Doing nothing" can be represented by a silent step tau, but tau is an activity that happens but is not visible, but in terms of control flow, it might work.

In the loop part, when I choose the "nothing" option, if I use X ( tau, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) ), then if I choose tau, I have a silent event, then go to AD.

But in the event log, there are no silent events, so the trace would have an extra tau, but since it's silent, it doesn't appear in the log, so the visible trace for that choice is just going to AD.

Similarly, for the other choice, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) , visible traces RMI+ VF.

And since X is exclusive choice, in some cases it chooses tau (silent), in others it chooses the sequence.

But in the process, the decision is not explicitly modeled, but it fits the behavior.

Moreover, in the traces, when there is no RMI, there is no additional VF, which is correct.

In this model, when I choose the loop part, I always do at least one RMI and then VF, but in the log, in Trace 2, no RMI and no VF, which is covered by choosing tau.

In Trace 1 and 3, I choose the other branch and do one or more RMI followed by VF.

In the exclusive choice, I can choose to do the sequence or not.

But in the sequence -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ), * (RMI, tau) requires at least one RMI, so I get at least one RMI and VF.

But in the log, the minimal loop is one RMI and one VF, as in Trace 1.

There is no case with zero RMI but still VF or something; when there is loop, at least one RMI and one VF.

In Trace 2, no additional activities.

So with X ( tau, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) ), the possible behaviors after AE:

- Choose tau: silent, then AD

- Choose -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ): do one or more RMI, then VF, then AD

Visible traces: epsilon (after silent), or RMI+ VF.

Perfect, matches the log.

Now, about the silent step: in the process tree, tau is allowed as a leaf.

In the exclusive choice, one child is tau, the other is the sequence.

In the loop * (RMI, tau), B is tau, which is fine.

Now, the full process tree.

The main sequence is RA -> VF -> AE -> [the choice part] -> AD -> SC -> AC

After the choice part, it goes to AD.

In the choice, when I choose tau, it goes to AD, when I choose the sequence, after VF it goes to AD.

So the structure should be a sequence: -> ( RA, VF, AE, X ( tau, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) ), AD, SC, AC )

In the sequence operator -> (A, B, C, ...), it means A then B then C in order.

And X is exclusive choice.

* is loop.

All operators are binary, I think? In the example, -> (A, B) is binary, but in the construction, children can be multiple.

Looking back at the example: seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root); then append multiple children.

In the ProcessTree object, children is a list, so operators can have multiple children.

In the initial description: -> (A, B) but in the code, seq.children.append(B) and append(C), so -> can have multiple children, meaning A then B then C, etc.

Similarly for other operators.

In the prompt: "-> ( A, B ) tells that the process tree A should be executed before the process tree B" but in the code, it has multiple children, so probably -> with multiple children means sequence.

In the example: seq.children.append(B) and append(C), and it's Operator.SEQUENCE.

Similarly, for XOR, PARALLEL, etc., can have multiple children.

For XOR, exclusive choice between multiple options.

For PARALLEL, true concurrency.

For LOOP, it's binary: * (A, B), so probably loop has exactly two children.

In the loop operator description: * (A, B), so likely two children.

In the code, when constructing loop, it should have two children.

In the example construction, for sequence, multiple children are added.

But for loop, probably it expects two children: the "do" part and the "redo" part.

In the prompt: "* ( A, B ) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again"

So yes, binary operator with two children.

In my earlier idea, for the RMI repetition, I used * (RMI, tau), which is fine, two children: A=RMI, B=tau.

Tau is a process tree with label="tau" or something.

In the leafs, it can be tau.

Now, for the exclusive choice after AE, I have X with two children: one is tau, the other is -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF )

-> here might have multiple children, but in this case, it's a sequence of two elements: the loop and VF.

So I can make a sequence node with two children: the loop node and the VF node.

Similarly, the main sequence: RA -> VF -> AE -> X_node -> AD -> SC -> AC

Where X_node is the exclusive choice with two children: tau and the sequence of loop and VF.

Now, about the beginning: all traces start with RA, VF, AE.

And end with AD, SC, AC.

No parallel or other choices there.

In the log, there might be concurrency, but in this log, all activities are in sequence per trace, no parallel indicated by timestamps or anything, but since timestamps are sequential in each trace, probably no concurrency.

In the prompt, it mentions that in the example, parallel allows different orders, but here, in the traces, the order is fixed except for the loop part.

In this specific log, all activities are in order, so sequence should be fine.

Now, to write the process tree.

Also, need to make sure about the loop.

In my model, I have a silent tau in the choice and in the loop.

Is that acceptable? Probably, as silent steps are allowed.

Perhaps I can avoid some silent steps.

Another way to model it without silent steps.

For example, after AE, have an exclusive choice: X ( -> (AD), -> (RMI, X ( -> (AD), -> (VF, and loop back or something)) ) ) but it's messy.

With the loop operator, it's harder.

Perhaps use a loop where A is X (something).

But with silent steps, it might be simpler.

In process mining, silent steps are often used to model choices.

Now, to confirm the traces.

In my model:

The process tree root is sequence with children: RA, VF, AE, X_node, AD, SC, AC

X_node is XOR with two children: tau_silent, and seq_loop

seq_loop is sequence with two children: loop_rmi, VF

loop_rmi is loop with two children: RMI, tau_redo (another silent tau)

In * (A, B) = * (RMI, tau), A is RMI, B is tau.

Possible behaviors:

After AE, X_node: either choose tau_silent: silent step, then AD

Or choose seq_loop: first execute loop_rmi = * (RMI, tau)

* (RMI, tau): executes RMI, then either exit or execute tau (silent) and then RMI again.

So visible traces for loop_rmi: RMI (if exit after first A), or RMI RMI (if do B and A again), etc., so RMI one or more times.

Then after loop_rmi, execute VF.

So overall for seq_loop: RMI+ VF

Then after X_node, to AD.

So yes.

In the exclusive choice, when choosing the loop part, it does at least one RMI and VF, which is correct for the log.

For no loop, silent step and to AD.

The silent steps don't produce events, so the traces match.

About simplicity: this model has silent steps, but it captures the behavior.

Perhaps I can model it without silent steps by having a different structure.

For example, after AE, have an exclusive choice between: -> (AD) and -> (RMI, then another exclusive choice between -> (AD) and -> (RMI, ... ) but it would need a recursive definition, which might not be directly possible in a tree, or I can unfold it, but for arbitrary repetitions, it's infinite.

So using the loop operator with silent steps is a way to compactly represent it.

In process mining, this is common.

Now, to write the process tree structure.

I need to specify the tree.

Probably in a similar notation as the example.

So, the root is a sequence operator with children:

- Activity: RA

- Activity: VF

- Activity: AE

- XOR operator with two children:

- Silent: tau

- Sequence operator with two children:

- Loop operator with two children:

- Activity: RMI

- Silent: tau

- Activity: VF

- Then back to the main sequence: Activity: AD

- Activity: SC

- Activity: AC

In the sequence, after the XOR, then AD, etc.

In tree terms, the root has children in order.

In the ProcessTree, the operator is set, and children are ordered.

For the XOR part, it's one child of the main sequence.

To write it clearly.

Perhaps I can define subtrees.

But for the answer, I need to describe the structure.

Since the task is to produce the final process tree model, just the structure.

So, I can write it in a nested way.

Let me try to write it similar to the example.

The root is -> ( RA, VF, AE, X ( tau, -> ( * ( RMI, tau ), VF ) ), AD, SC, AC )

Yes.

In this notation, the operators are binary or multi-ary? In the ->, I have multiple arguments, which is fine as per the code.

Similarly for X.

And * has two arguments.

Also, tau is a leaf with label "tau".

In the event log, there is also the initial VF, and in the loop, another VF, which is correct.

Is there any other behavior? In the log, sometimes multiple RMI, handled.

No parallel, no other choices.

About fitness, precision: this model can produce the observed traces, and also some with silent steps, but since silent, not visible.

It can produce traces with multiple RMI and VF, which are in the model, but in the log, maximum two RMI, but the model allows more, but that's ok for generalization.

It doesn't allow traces without VF after RMI, which is good.

Precision: it might allow more behaviors, like choosing the loop but only doing RMI without VF? No, because in the sequence, after * (RMI, tau), it must do VF.

In * (RMI, tau), it always does at least one RMI and ends with RMI, then VF, so always RMI and VF when chosen.

And the exclusive choice ensures that either nothing (silent) or the loop part.

So it should be precise for the observed behavior.

Simplicity: it uses the necessary operators.

Perhaps I can avoid one silent step.

For example, instead of having tau in the XOR, maybe model the loop differently.

But I think it's fine.

Another common way is to have the loop include the decision.

But with the given operator, this works.

Now, to box the answer.

So the process tree is:

A sequence of: 'Receive Application (RA)', 'Validate Form (VF)', 'Assess Eligibility (AE)', an exclusive choice between silent step (tau) and a sequence of a loop (with 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' and silent step tau) and 'Validate Form (VF)', then 'Approval Decision (AD)', 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 'Archive Case (AC)'.

To write it formally.

Perhaps in the same notation as the prompt.

Like: -> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', X ( tau, -> ( * ( 'RMI', tau ), 'VF' ) ), 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )

Yes.

And specify that tau is the silent step.

In the process tree, the labels are as given.

I think this should be the answer.
</think>

The discovered process tree model captures the main sequential flow of the process, including the optional loop for handling missing information (RMI) and re-validation (VF). The model uses silent steps (tau) to represent invisible choices and loop decisions, ensuring a balance of fitness, precision, and simplicity. The structure is as follows:

- Root operator: Sequence ()
  - Child 1: Activity 'Receive Application (RA)'
  - Child 2: Activity 'Validate Form (VF)'
  - Child 3: Activity 'Assess Eligibility (AE)'
  - Child 4: Exclusive Choice (X) with two children:
    - Child 1: Silent step (tau) – represents the option to skip the loop and proceed directly.
    - Child 2: Sequence () with two children:
      - Child 1: Loop (*) with two children:
        - Child 1 (A): Activity 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' – the main body of the loop.
        - Child 2 (B): Silent step (tau) – represents the decision to redo the loop (i.e., repeat RMI).
      - Child 2: Activity 'Validate Form (VF)' – executed after the loop completes.
  - Child 5: Activity 'Approval Decision (AD)'
  - Child 6: Activity 'Send Confirmation (SC)'
  - Child 7: Activity 'Archive Case (AC)'

This process tree ensures:
- **Fitness**: All traces in the event log can be replayed (e.g., no loop for Case 2, one or more RMI followed by VF for Cases 1 and 3).
- **Precision**: The model does not allow invalid traces, such as RMI without subsequent VF in the loop or missing the initial sequence.
- **Simplicity**: It uses a compact structure with minimal operators, leveraging the loop for repetition and exclusive choice for the optional behavior.

In a more compact notation similar to the prompt:
```
-> ( 'Receive Application (RA)', 'Validate Form (VF)', 'Assess Eligibility (AE)', X ( tau, -> ( * ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', tau ), 'Validate Form (VF)' ) ), 'Approval Decision (AD)', 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 'Archive Case (AC)' )
```
