--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. PROCESS DISCOVERY AND CONFORMANCE CHECKING
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Event-log construction  
• Primary case notion – “Vehicle-Day” (e.g., V12-20241205). Gives a full working shift from “Start Shift” to “End Shift”.  
• Secondary case notion – “Package” (P-level). Allows drill-down to single deliveries and failed attempts.  
• Steps  
  1. Harmonise clocks (time-zone, GPS vs. scanner drift).  
  2. Map source attributes to one canonical schema:  
     – Activity (verb + noun) e.g., “Depart Depot”, “Arrive Customer”.  
     – Lifecycle (start/complete) where required for duration metrics.  
     – Resource (Driver ID, Vehicle ID).  
  3. De-duplicate bursts from GPS (keep status change only or resample every 2–3 min).  
  4. Enrich with master data: planned sequence (#stop order, planned ETA, distance, capacity left), fuel level, maintenance category.  
  5. Link maintenance logs during a shift as “Maintenance Start/End” activities inside the same case.  
Challenges: inconsistent IDs, missing GPS segments (urban canyons), different granularity (seconds vs. minutes), and nested processes (package inside route). Solutions: fuzzy matching, interpolation, multi-level process mining plug-ins.

1.2 Discovery  
• Run Inductive Miner (noise threshold  0.1) on Vehicle-Day log to obtain a sound, comprehensible model; switch to Fuzzy Miner for high-volume GPS variants.  
• Create two views:  
  A. High-level (Depot  multiple Customer Stops  Depot).  
  B. Detail view with traffic/idle/unscheduled-stop loops.  
• Overlay frequency and performance (edge thickness = #cases, colour = mean duration) to spot dominant paths and long waits.

1.3 Conformance to plan  
• Generate reference model from dispatch table: ordered list of planned stops with expected service & travel times.  
• Use alignment-based conformance: for every case produce  
  – Move on Log (unplanned stop, extra loop)  
  – Move on Model (skipped / out-of-order stop)  
  – Temporal deviation (t planned vs. actual).  
• Typical deviations we track  
  • Sequence: overtaken stops, reverse ordering, missed stops.  
  • Content: unscheduled fuel or personal breaks, maintenance interruptions.  
  • Timing: > X min early/late arrival at customer, overtime at end of shift.  
  • Velocity: prolonged “Low-Speed” or “Idle” segments not foreseen in plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS & BOTTLENECKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Key KPIs derivable from the log  
1. On-Time Delivery Rate (%) – Delivery Success within customer time-window / total deliveries.  
2. Average Service Time per Stop – Depart Customer ­ Arrive Customer.  
3. Travel vs. Service Ratio – (Travel Time)/(Service Time) per route.  
4. Average Idle/Traffic Delay per route – (duration of “Low Speed < 8 km/h” or “Idle”).  
5. Fuel per km & per package – fuel sensor  / GPS distance or interpolated consumption curves.  
6. Vehicle Utilisation – (Shift duration – maintenance downtime) / legally available hours.  
7. Failed-Delivery Rate and Re-delivery cost.  
8. Mean Time Between Unscheduled Repairs (MTBUR).

2.2 Techniques  
• Performance-annotated process maps to visualise slow transitions (thick red edges).  
• Dotted Charts: x-axis time-of-day, y-axis vehicles – cluster congestion patterns.  
• Resource/route filters to compare:  
   – Top-20% vs. bottom-20% drivers (variant analysis).  
   – Morning vs. afternoon tours.  
   – Urban vs. suburban postcodes.  
• Bottleneck quantification: KPI if a given activity is removed/optimised (what-if plug-ins), or path-frequency × average delay.  
• Geo-heatmaps overlaying “Low-Speed” & long “ArriveDepart” durations to identify traffic or parking hotspots.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Potential causes and supporting analyses:

A. Sub-optimal routing  
   – Compare planned vs. fastest historical path (graph mining). High sequence deviation + longer travel time  planning issue.  
B. Wrong travel-time estimates  
   – Regression of actual travel time against distance, time-of-day, weekday. Systematic underestimation  parametric error.  
C. Traffic congestion patterns  
   – Correlate GPS “Low-Speed” events with external traffic feeds; high correlation for certain corridors 07:30–09:00.  
D. Service-time variability  
   – Box-plot service times by customer type, parcel count; heavy-tail for apartment buildings w/out elevators.  
E. Vehicle reliability  
   – Process variant “Maintenance loop present” shows +18 min average route delay; unscheduled repairs concentrate on older vans.  
F. Driver behaviour  
   – Idle > 10 min, harsh acceleration counts; cluster drivers by eco-score vs. fuel per km.  
G. Failed deliveries  
   – Variant “Delivery Failed  Re-delivery next day” lengthens lead-time by 1.4 days; high in postcodes with absent daytime customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. DATA-DRIVEN OPTIMISATION STRATEGIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy 1 – Dynamic, traffic-aware re-routing  
• Target inefficiency: long travel & idle times caused by congestion and sequence deviations.  
• Root cause: static overnight route planning ignores real-time traffic.  
• Process-mining insight: 32 % of cases show >15 min “Low-Speed” on the same city arteries between 08:00–09:30; reordering later stops reduces delay variance by 27 %.  
• Action: Implement mid-shift re-optimisation engine that uses historical delay probabilities mined from the log + live traffic API; new sequence sent to driver app.  
• Expected impact: +8 pp On-Time Delivery, 12 % fuel (less idle), 0.3 h average overtime.

Strategy 2 – Predictive maintenance scheduling  
• Target: unscheduled breakdowns causing route interruptions and costly towing.  
• Root cause: time-based maintenance intervals ignore actual utilisation patterns.  
• Insight: event log shows rising engine-warning frequency after 8 000 km since last service; breakdown probability doubles after first warning.  
• Action: Build survival model using process data; schedule service windows before risk > 20 %; replace vans with chronic alerts.  
• Impact: 60 % unscheduled maintenance minutes, +0.5 pp vehicle utilisation, 5 % maintenance cost.

Strategy 3 – Smart customer time-window & notification management  
• Target: failed deliveries and re-delivery mileage.  
• Root cause: customer not home; time windows too narrow or unrealistic.  
• Insight: 70 % of failures occur in 12:00–14:00 slot for residential addresses; actual arrival distribution shifted to late afternoon.  
• Action:  
   1. Use arrival histograms per postcode to offer “data-driven” windows that align with route reality.  
   2. Push proactive ETA SMS 20 min before arrival (GPS-based).  
• Impact: 35 % failed attempts, 7 % total kilometres, +4 pp On-Time Delivery.

Strategy 4 – Targeted eco-driving & parking-speed training (optional extra)  
• Focus on drivers with top quartile idle & service times; use replay animations to show inefficiencies.  
• Expected: 6 % fuel, 2 min median service time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS & CONTINUOUS MONITORING
--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 Respecting constraints  
• Driver hours: optimisation solver includes legal max shift (e.g., 9 h driving, 56 h/week).  
• Vehicle capacity: territory re-balancing keeps weight/volume  rated.  
• Customer promises: new routing must not violate confirmed windows unless re-negotiated (Strategy 3).  
• Maintenance slots scheduled outside peak demand; spare vans kept ready.

5.2 Monitoring framework  
• Daily automated ETL to update event log  process-mining server (Celonis/PM4Py).  
Dashboards:  
  • KPI tiles: On-Time %, Fuel/km, Avg Idle, Failed-Delivery %, MTBUR.  
  • Conformance heat-map: deviation count by route & driver.  
  • Real-time alert: if live alignment shows >2 unplanned stops or ETA drift >15 min, dispatch notified.  
  • Trend charts pre- vs. post-implementation (A/B routes) to verify ROI.  
  • Drill-down filters: day-of-week, weather, vehicle age.  
Governance: monthly review meeting; adjust thresholds; retrain predictive models every quarter.
