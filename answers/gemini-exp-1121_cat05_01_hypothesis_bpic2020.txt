| 2   | What is the average performance time for the most common process variant?                                        | 100%             | Performance data is available for each variant, simple average calculation needed.                                                                                                                                            |
| 3   | What percentage of declarations are successfully paid without any rejections?                                  | 95%              | Can be calculated by summing frequencies of successful paths and dividing by total frequency. Minor assumption that "Payment Handled" implies successful payment.                                                        |

Assumption is that presence in path indicates involvement.                                                                                       |

| 7   | What is the average performance time for declarations that are rejected by the Administration at least once?      | 90%              | Can calculate by averaging performance times for variants including "REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION," weighted by frequency.                                                                                                         |
| 8   | How does the involvement of a Pre-Approver affect the average performance time?                                  | 85%              | Can compare average performance of variants with and without "PRE_APPROVER". Requires grouping and weighted averages.                                                                                                         |
| 9   | What is the performance time difference between the fastest and slowest process variants for successful payments? | 85%              | Can directly compare minimum and maximum performance times for variants ending in "Payment Handled."                                                                                                                           |
| 10  | How many declarations are saved without being submitted?                                                         | 100%             | Direct data available for "SAVED by EMPLOYEE."                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11  | What percentage of rejections by the Supervisor are followed by a successful payment after re-submission?          | 80%              | Needs careful analysis of paths involving supervisor rejections followed by eventual payment. Can be derived but requires some manual path tracing and calculation.                                                        |
| 12  | Are there any bottlenecks in the process, and where are they most likely occurring?                              | 75%              | Can infer potential bottlenecks by looking at steps preceding high rejection rates or long performance times, but requires some interpretation and additional process knowledge (e.g., we don't have individual step times).     |
| 13  | What is the financial impact of the different process variants (e.g., cost per variant)?                         | 60%              | Data doesn't include cost information. Would need external data or assumptions to answer.                                                                                                                                      |
| 14  | Does the performance time correlate with the number of steps in the process variant?                              | 75%              | Can be analyzed by plotting number of steps vs. performance time. Requires some data manipulation and correlation analysis.                                                                                                    |
| 15  | What is the impact of missing information ("MISSING") on the declaration process?                               | 80%              | Can analyze variants involving "MISSING." Frequency and performance implications can be assessed.                                                                                                                               |
| 16  | How often does an employee re-submit a declaration after it has been rejected?                                   | 85%              | Can be determined by analyzing paths containing multiple "SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" after rejections.                                                                                                                              |
| 17  | Is there a significant difference in performance between declarations approved by the Administration vs. a Pre-Approver? | 80%              | Can compare average performance times of paths involving these two approvers. Needs grouping and significance testing might be needed for robust conclusions.                                                                       |
| 18  | What percentage of declarations require more than one submission by the employee due to rejections?                 | 85%              | Can be calculated by summing frequencies of variants with multiple submissions and dividing by the total number of submitted declarations.                                                                                        |
| 19  | Are there any patterns or correlations between specific employee roles and the likelihood of rejections?            | 60%              | Data doesn't contain employee-specific information. Would need additional data on employee roles and rejection rates to answer this.                                                                                              |
| 20  | What would be the impact on overall performance if we could eliminate all rejections from the process?             | 70%              | Can be estimated by recalculating weighted average performance, excluding rejection paths. However, it's an assumption that the system would behave the same without rejections and actual impact might be different. |
