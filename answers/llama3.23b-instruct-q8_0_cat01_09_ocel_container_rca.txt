Based on the provided data, here are some potential root causes for the performance issues:

1. **Forklift activities affecting other processes**: The long durations of "Load to Vehicle" (up to 49 hours), "Place in Stock" (up to 27 hours), and "Depart" (up to 11 hours) suggest that these activities can significantly delay neighboring processes, such as "Weigh", "Bring to Loading Bay", and "Book Vehicles". This could be due to inefficiencies in forklift routing or operations.
2. **Container reservation conflicts**: The frequent need to reschedule containers ("Reschedule Container" activity), which results in delays and increased waiting times, indicates potential issues with container availability, reservations, or real-time tracking.
3. **Empty container ordering issues**: The prolonged time taken by the "Order Empty Containers" process (up to 43 days) might be due to inefficiencies in replenishment logistics, inventory management, or delayed communication between departments.
4. **Transport document creation and updating bottlenecks**: The long duration of the "Create Transport Document" activity (up to 329 hours) suggests that there may be limitations or inefficiencies in this process, which could be caused by inadequate data integration, manual processing, or excessive checks.

To mitigate these performance issues, consider:

1. Implementing more efficient forklift routes and operations.
2. Optimizing container reservations and real-time tracking systems.
3. Streamlining empty container ordering processes to reduce lead times.
4. Improving transport document creation, updating, and data integration processes to reduce manual steps and checks.

By addressing these specific process-related issues, the organization can aim to optimize performance, reduce delays, and improve overall efficiency.
