We are going to break down the problem into steps:

 Step 1: For each case_id, get the ordered sequence of activities (by timestamp) and represent it as a string (or array) to define the variant.
 Step 2: Count the number of cases per variant and then determine the top K variants by frequency.
 Step 3: Use the top K variants to filter the original event_log to only include cases that have one of these top K variants.

 However, note: We are not given a specific K. Let's assume we are to get the top 1 variant? But the problem says "top K", so we need to make K configurable.
 Since the problem does not specify K, we can either use a variable or choose a fixed K. In DuckDB, we can use the LIMIT clause with an ordered count.

 But note: the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

 Let's assume we are to get the top 3 variants (if we have to choose a fixed K). However, to make it flexible, we can use a parameter. But DuckDB doesn't have stored parameters in the same way.
 Alternatively, we can use a CTE and then use a limit. Since the problem doesn't specify, let's choose K=3.

 Steps:

 1. Create a CTE (or subquery) that for each case_id, computes the variant (the ordered sequence of activities) as a string (or array). We can use string_agg to form a string of activities ordered by timestamp.

 2. Then, we count the cases per variant and order by frequency (descending) and take the top 3.

 3. Then, we can filter the original event_log by case_id that are in the set of case_ids that have one of the top 3 variants.

 However, note: the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

 So we need to get the case_ids that have the top K variants. But note: the top K variants are defined by the variant string and then we take the top K by frequency.

 But note: multiple case_ids can have the same variant. So we can do:

 - First, compute the variant for each case.
 - Then, compute the frequency of each variant and rank them (or use a window function) to get the top K.
 - Then, we can get the case_ids that have a variant that is in the top K.

 Alternatively, we can do:

 Step 1: Assign a variant string to each case.
 Step 2: Count the cases per variant and assign a rank (or use a limit) to get the top K variants.
 Step 3: Then, we can join back to the original event_log on case_id, but only for cases that have a variant in the top K.

 Let's write the query accordingly.

 We'll use:

 WITH case_variants AS (
   SELECT 
     case_id,
     string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
 ),
 variant_counts AS (
   SELECT 
     variant,
     COUNT(*) as frequency
   FROM case_variants
   GROUP BY variant
   ORDER BY frequency DESC
   LIMIT 3  -- top 3 variants
 )
 SELECT el.*
 FROM event_log el
 WHERE el.case_id IN (
   SELECT case_id
   FROM case_variants cv
   WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)
 )
 ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;

 However, note: the problem does not specify an order for the final output, but typically we might want to order by case and then by timestamp.

 But wait: the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

 This query does that.

 However, note: the variant is computed by ordering the activities by timestamp. We are using string_agg with an ORDER BY timestamp to get the sequence.

 Let me test the logic:

 - We are aggregating the activities in the order of timestamp, so the string will represent the sequence.

 But note: what if two activities have the same timestamp? The problem says "ordered sequence of activities that occur in a single case, determined by sorting events within that case by their timestamp". So if two activities have the same timestamp, then the order is non-deterministic? But the problem doesn't specify. We assume that the timestamp is unique per case? Or if not, we might need to break ties. The problem doesn't specify, so we assume the timestamp is unique enough to order.

 Alternatively, we can use an array_agg to preserve the order and then use that for grouping? But the problem says "process variant" is the ordered sequence, so we can use string_agg to form a string that represents the sequence.

 But note: if two different sequences form the same string? For example, if we have activities 'A' and 'B' and then again 'A' and 'B', then the string would be 'A -> B -> A -> B'. This is safe.

 Let's write the query accordingly.

 However, note: the problem does not specify the delimiter. We use ' -> ' but it can be any delimiter that does not appear in the activity names. If activity names can contain ' -> ', then we might have issues. But the problem does not specify, so we assume it's safe.

 Alternatively, we can use array_agg and then use the array for grouping. But then we cannot use IN with an array of arrays? We can use a hash of the array? Or we can convert the array to a string? Let's stick with string_agg because it's simpler.

 But note: the problem does not require the variant to be a string, but we need to group by the variant. So we can use either.

 Let me adjust: if we use array_agg, then we can group by the array. But then we cannot use the array in the IN clause? Actually, in DuckDB, we can. But let's check the documentation? Alternatively, we can use the string representation.

 Since the problem does not specify, let's use string_agg.

 However, note: the problem says "complete activity sequence", so the string representation is acceptable.

 Let's run with the above query.

 But wait: the problem says "top K variants by their frequency", and we are using a LIMIT 3. What if there are ties? The problem does not specify how to break ties. We are simply taking the top 3 by frequency, and if there are multiple variants with the same frequency, we are taking the first 3 we get when ordering by frequency descending. This might be non-deterministic if there are ties. The problem doesn't specify, so we assume that it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can use a window function to get all variants that are in the top K by frequency, even if there are ties? But the problem says "top K variants", so if we have ties for the K-th place, we might get more than K. The problem doesn't specify. Let's assume we want exactly the top K, and if there are ties we break arbitrarily.

 We can use:

 WITH ...,
variant_ranks AS (
  SELECT variant, frequency,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as rank
  FROM variant_counts
)
...

 But then we can filter by rank <= K. However, the problem does not specify the behavior in case of ties. We are going to use the simple LIMIT approach, which may arbitrarily break ties.

 Since the problem does not specify, we'll use LIMIT.

 Let me adjust the query to use a parameter for K? We can use a variable. But in DuckDB, we can use the `?` parameter if we are using the API. In a standalone SQL, we can use a CTE to define K.

 Alternatively, we can use a constant. Let's assume we want K=3.

 Final query:

WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    variant,
    COUNT(*) as frequency
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
  ORDER BY frequency DESC
  LIMIT 3
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM case_variants cv
  WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)
)
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;

 This should return all events from the top 3 variants, ordered by case and then by timestamp.

 However, note: the problem does not require the output to be ordered, but it's typical to order by case and timestamp for readability.

 Let me check: the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

 We are returning the events in the order of the original log? Not necessarily, we are ordering by case_id and timestamp. But the original log might have been in any order. The problem doesn't specify the order, so we can choose. We choose to order by case and then timestamp.

 Alternatively, we can remove the ORDER BY if the problem does not require a specific order.

 But the problem says "the sequence of activities" is determined by sorting by timestamp, so we are consistent by ordering by case_id and timestamp in the final output.

 We'll keep the ORDER BY.

 Let me test with a sample data:

 event_log:
 case_id, activity, timestamp
 1, 'A', '2024-01-01 10:00'
 1, 'B', '2024-01-01 11:00'
 2, 'A', '2024-01-01 10:00'
 2, 'B', '2024-01-01 11:00'
 3, 'A', '2024-01-01 10:00'
 3, 'C', '2024-01-01 11:00'

 Then, the variants:
   Case1: 'A -> B'
   Case2: 'A -> B'
   Case3: 'A -> C'

 Then, variant_counts:
   'A -> B' -> 2
   'A -> C' -> 1

 Then, top 2 variants (if K=2) would be 'A -> B' and 'A -> C'. But if we set K=1, then only 'A -> B'.

 So the query with K=1 would return events for case1 and case2.

 This matches.

 We are done.

Here's a DuckDB SQL query that solves the problem step by step:

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    -- Step 1: Construct ordered sequence of activities per case
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    -- Step 2: Count cases per variant and rank by frequency
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS variant_rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    -- Step 3: Get top K variants (replace 3 with desired K value)
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    WHERE variant_rank <= 3  -- Top 3 variants
),
top_k_cases AS (
    -- Step 4: Get case_ids belonging to top K variants
    SELECT DISTINCT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    INNER JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON cs.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
)
-- Final result: All events from cases in top K variants
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN top_k_cases tkc ON el.case_id = tkc.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

**Explanation of each step:**

1. **`case_sequences` CTE**: 
   - Groups events by `case_id`
   - Uses `string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp)` to create ordered sequences
   - Result: each case_id mapped to its complete activity sequence

2. **`variant_counts` CTE**:
   - Groups by `activity_sequence` to count cases per variant
   - Uses `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)` to rank variants by frequency
   - Result: each variant with its case count and rank

3. **`top_k_variants` CTE**:
   - Filters `variant_counts` to get only the top K variants
   - Change `3` to any desired K value

4. **`top_k_cases` CTE**:
   - Joins `case_sequences` with `top_k_variants` to get all case_ids that belong to top variants

5. **Final SELECT**:
   - Joins original event log with filtered cases
   - Returns all events for cases in top K variants
   - Ordered by case_id and timestamp for readability

**Key features:**
- Uses `string_agg()` with `ORDER BY timestamp` to preserve activity order
- Handles ties in variant frequency through `ROW_NUMBER()` ranking
- Efficiently filters using CTEs before final join
- Maintains all original event data for the selected cases

To modify K, simply change the `3` in `WHERE variant_rank <= 3` to your desired value.
