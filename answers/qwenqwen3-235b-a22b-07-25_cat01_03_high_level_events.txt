### **Proposed High-Level Manufacturing Process Steps**

Based on the analysis of the provided event log, we identify **four coherent high-level activities** that represent distinct stages in the manufacturing workflow. These stages are derived from patterns in **temporal proximity**, **functional purpose**, **resource roles**, and **logical progression** of low-level events.

Below is the structured representation of the high-level activities, including their constituent low-level events, naming, and justifications.

---

### **1. Material Preparation**
**Description:** Initial setup and conditioning of the raw material before active processing begins.  
**Constituent Low-Level Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet  
- Scan barcode  
- Place metal sheet on table  
- Align metal sheet  
- Preheat metal sheet  

**Case Examples (from log):**
- Case A1: Events from `2024-03-01 08:00:05` to `2024-03-01 08:00:20`
- Case B2: Events from `2024-03-01 08:00:05` to `2024-03-01 08:00:25`

**Rationale:**
- These events occur at the beginning of each case and prepare the workpiece for further operations.
- They involve **material handling (Operator A)**, **verification (barcode scan)**, **positioning (placement and alignment by robot)**, and **conditioning (preheating)**.
- Functionally, this phase ensures the raw material is correctly identified, positioned, and brought to optimal temperature for downstream processing.
- Temporal clustering: All occur within the first ~20 seconds of each case.

### **2. Component Assembly (Welding)**
**Description:** Joining parts or features of the component using welding operations.  
**Constituent Low-Level Events:**
- Pick up welding tool  
- Weld corner A  
- Weld corner B  

**Case Examples:**
- Case A1: Events from `2024-03-01 08:01:00` to `2024-03-01 08:01:10`
- Case B2: Events from `2024-03-01 08:01:03` to `2024-03-01 08:01:12`

**Rationale:**
- These events represent the **core fabrication step** — physically assembling the part via welding.
- The sequence follows a **logical dependency**: tool must be picked up before welding can occur.
- Performed by **Operator B**, indicating a specialized role in assembly.
- Immediate temporal succession with no intervening unrelated events.
- The two welds (corner A and B) are of the same type and likely part of a single assembly routine.

### **3. Quality Verification**
**Description:** Objective and subjective checks to ensure product meets quality standards.  
**Constituent Low-Level Events:**
- Measure weld integrity  
- Visual check  

**Case Examples:**
- Case A1: Events at `2024-03-01 08:01:20` and `2024-03-01 08:02:00`
- Case B2: Events at `2024-03-01 08:01:22` and `2024-03-01 08:02:05`

**Rationale:**
- Both events serve a **quality assurance function**, albeit different modalities:
  - *Measure weld integrity*  automated, quantitative check (sensor-based).
  - *Visual check*  manual, qualitative inspection (human operator).
- Separated in time due to intermediate coating/drying, but **functionally grouped** as verification tasks.
- Performed by different resources (**Quality Sensor #1** and **Operator C**) but aligned in purpose: validation of product quality.
- Occur **after major processing steps**, suggesting a checkpoint before finalization.

>  **Note:** Although drying occurs between these two events, the *Visual Check* likely inspects the **final product**, including coating. Thus, the entire QA phase spans from weld inspection to final visual approval.

---

### **4. Surface Treatment & Curing**
**Description:** Application and stabilization of protective coating on the finished component.  
**Constituent Low-Level Events:**
- Apply protective coating  
- Dry coating  

**Case Examples:**
- Case A1: Events from `2024-03-01 08:01:30` to `2024-03-01 08:01:45`
- Case B2: Events from `2024-03-01 08:01:35` to `2024-03-01 08:01:50`

**Rationale:**
- These events form a **chemical/thermal treatment sequence**:
  - Coating application  followed by drying (curing).
- Performed by dedicated equipment (**Coating Unit #3**, **Heating Unit #2**) — indicating a specialized subsystem.
- Temporally adjacent and functionally interdependent: drying is necessary after coating.
- Represents a **finish process**, not part of structural assembly or inspection.

### **Aggregation Logic & Inference Rules**

To generalize grouping across the full event log, the following **rules** can be applied:

1. **Temporal Proximity:** Events occurring within a short time window (<30 seconds) and without interruptions are grouped if functionally related.
2. **Functional Cohesion:** Events serving the same goal (e.g., preparation, joining, inspection) are grouped even if not fully contiguous (e.g., QA checks may be split by treatment).
3. **Resource Specialization:** Events performed by the same or similar resource types (e.g., operators with specific roles, dedicated machines) suggest a common phase.
4. **Sequential Dependencies:** Actions that depend on prior completion (e.g., pick tool  weld) belong to the same high-level step.
5. **Phase Separators:** Automated quality checks or transitions to new machines often mark boundaries between high-level stages.

### **Conclusion**

This abstraction transforms a granular, machine-level event log into a **human-readable, process-centric workflow**. It enables:
- **Process monitoring** at a strategic level.
- **Performance analysis** (e.g., time per high-level step).
- **Anomaly detection** (e.g., missing steps, long delays between phases).
- **Compliance and audit reporting** with clear stage definitions.

The proposed grouping reflects the natural **phases of metal fabrication**: preparation  assembly  finishing  verification. This structure can be applied consistently across all cases in the full log.
