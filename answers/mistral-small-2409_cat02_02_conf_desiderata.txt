### Identifying Violations of Normative Rules

**Case 1:**
- **Compliance:** Case 1 follows the strict sequence correctly.
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **Conclusion:** No normative violations.

**Case 2:**
- **Violation:** The sequence was violated with the Risk Assessment occurring before the Credit Check.
  - Correct Sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant
  - Observed Sequence: Application Received  Risk Assessment  Credit Check  Loan Decision  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **Reasons for Violation:**
  - The Risk Assessment was performed before the Credit Check, which contradicts the ordering rules.
  - Finalize Documentation was performed after a rejection, which is not allowed.

**Case 3:**
- **Violation:** No direct normative rules were violated, but it's important to note that the sequence and ordering rules were adhered to.
  - Correct Sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
  - Observed Sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **Conclusion:** No normative violations, but the Follow-up Call was missing.

### Identifying Violations of Desiderata Conditions

**Desiderata Conditions:**
1. Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours of the application.
2. Applicant should be informed within 48 hours of the loan decision.
3. A Follow-up Call to the applicant is encouraged before closing the case.

**Case 1:**
- **Compliance:** All desiderata conditions were met.
  - Credit Check was completed within 24 hours of the application.
  - Applicant was informed within 48 hours of the loan decision.
  - Follow-up Call is not recorded, but not a serious issue.

**Case 2:**
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - Sequence violation (addressed above).
  - Finalize Documentation after rejection.
- **Conclusion:** Serious normative violations overshadow desiderata concerns.

**Case 3:**
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - Credit Check was completed more than 24 hours after the application.
  - Inform Applicant was done later than recommended 48 hours.
  - Follow-up Call was missing.
- **Conclusion:** While these are suboptimal, they are not severe violations.

### Suggested Interpretations or Justifications

**Case 2:**
- **Justification:** The sequence violation (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) might have occurred due to an operational oversight or miscommunication within the team. The finalization after rejection could be a procedural error, highlighting the need for stricter adherence to the decision logic.

**Case 3:**
- **Interpretation:** The delay in the Credit Check and informing the applicant might be due to staffing issues or a high volume of applications. The missing Follow-up Call could have been overlooked due to workload or procedural gaps.

**General Recommendations:**
- **Enhanced Training:** Ensure all staff are well-trained on the strict sequence and ordering rules.
- **Automation:** Implement automated checks and reminders to enforce the strict sequence and timing recommendations.
- **Process Review:** Regularly review processes to identify bottlenecks causing delays and ensure all steps are followed correctly.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a feedback mechanism to quickly address procedural errors and ensure timely follow-ups.

By addressing both the normative violations and the desiderata violations, the loan application process can be made more efficient and compliant with established guidelines.
