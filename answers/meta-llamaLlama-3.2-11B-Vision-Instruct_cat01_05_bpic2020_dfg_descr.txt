The process underlying this data appears to be a workflow for managing declarations, which are likely financial or administrative documents. The process involves several roles: EMPLOYEE, SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, and BUDGET OWNER.

Here is a step-by-step description of the process:

1. **Declaration Submission**: The process begins with an EMPLOYEE submitting a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. **Initial Review**: The submitted declaration is reviewed by ADMINISTRATION (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION) or PRE_APPROVER (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER). If approved, it proceeds to the next step.
3. **Budget Owner Review**: If the declaration is approved by ADMINISTRATION, it is then reviewed by BUDGET OWNER (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER). If approved, it proceeds to the next step.
4. **Final Approval**: If the declaration is approved by BUDGET OWNER, it is then reviewed by SUPERVISOR for final approval (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR). Alternatively, if the declaration was initially approved by PRE_APPROVER, it may also proceed to final approval by SUPERVISOR (Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
5. **Payment Request**: Once the declaration is FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, a payment request is made (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment).
6. **Payment Handling**: The payment request is then handled (Request Payment -> Payment Handled).
7. **Rejection**: If any of the previous steps result in rejection, the declaration is sent back to the EMPLOYEE for revision. The rejection can occur at various stages, including:
	* ADMINISTRATION (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION)
	* PRE_APPROVER (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER)
	* SUPERVISOR (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR)
	* BUDGET OWNER (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER)
	* MISSING (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING)
8. **Revision and Resubmission**: If the declaration is rejected, it is sent back to the EMPLOYEE for revision and resubmission.

The process appears to be designed to ensure that
