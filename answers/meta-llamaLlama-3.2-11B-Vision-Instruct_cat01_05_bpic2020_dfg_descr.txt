A fascinating swimlane diagram!

After analyzing the data, I've identified the process underlying this flow:

**The Process: Expense Declaration and Payment**

The process involves an employee submitting a declaration, which is then reviewed and approved by various individuals, with the goal of receiving payment.

**Steps:**

1. **Employee Submission**: An employee submits a declaration ( Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. **Initial Review**: The employee's submission is reviewed by a pre-approver (Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER), an administration (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION), or a budget owner (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER). If approved, the process proceeds to steps 4-6. If rejected, the submission is resent to the employee for resubmission (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
3. **Final Approval**: The approved declaration is then reviewed by a supervisor (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR), who grants final approval.
4. **Request for Payment**: Once finalized, a request for payment is generated (Request Payment).
5. **Payment Processing**: The payment is processed (Payment Handled).
6. **Closure**: The declaration is marked as FINAL_APPROVED, and the process is complete.

**Potential Issues and Failures:**

* A submission can be rejected by any of the intermediate approvers, causing a loop back to step 1.
* A supervisor can also reject a submission, causing a loop back to step 1.
* There is a possibility of a declaration being submitted but not making it through the approvals process, as indicated by the paths terminating at unknown states (e.g., Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by MISSING).
* Payment can fail to be processed, as indicated by the flow from Request Payment to Declaration REJECTED by MISSING.

**Possible Causes of Certain Outcomes:**

* The unusual high performance values in the Payment Handled -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE path could indicate a delayed payment schedule.
* The high frequency of path from Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE to Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR could indicate a bottleneck or inconsistent activity in the approval process.

This is a high-level summary of the process, drill-down further to explore specific aspects and potential improvements to optimize the flow!
