**Explanation and Breakdown:**

1.  **`RankedActivities` CTE:**
    *   Assigns a rank to each activity within a `case_id` based on the `timestamp` using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)`. This ensures activities are numbered in the correct order within each case.
    *   Includes the original `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp` for later use.

2.  **`ActivitySequences` CTE:**
    *   Aggregates the activities for each `case_id`.
    *   Uses `STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY activity_order)` to create a comma-separated string representing the activity sequence for each case, maintaining the order determined by `activity_order`.
    *  Calculates and keeps track of the number of activities in each sequence (`num_activities`), which is not strictly required in the final query but potentially helpful for some analyses.

3.  **`VariantCounts` CTE:**
    *   Calculates the frequency of each unique activity sequence (variant).
    *   `COUNT(*)` counts the number of cases having the same `activity_sequence`.
    *   `ORDER BY case_count DESC` sorts the variants by their frequency in descending order.
    *   `LIMIT 10` selects the top 10 variants (this is where you set the value for `K`).  Replace `10` with the desired value for `K` (e.g., `LIMIT 5` for the top 5 variants).

4.  **`TopVariantCases` CTE:**
    *   This CTE efficiently identifies the `case_id`s that belong to the top K variants, based on a join between `ActivitySequences` and `VariantCounts`.  It avoids redundant joins.

5.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   Selects all columns (`el.*`) from the original `event_log` table.
    *   Joins the `event_log` with the `TopVariantCases` CTE using `case_id` to filter down to only the events belonging to cases that are part of the top K variants.
    *   `ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp` orders the results by case and timestamp for easy verification and consistent results.

**How to Run and Adapt:**

1.  **Create the `event_log` table:** You'll need to create the `event_log` table in your DuckDB environment before running the query. Example data and table creation (using DuckDB's SQL syntax):

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE event_log (
        case_id VARCHAR,
        activity VARCHAR,
        timestamp TIMESTAMP
    );

    INSERT INTO event_log VALUES
    ('case1', 'A', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
    ('case1', 'B', '2023-01-01 11:00:00'),
    ('case1', 'C', '2023-01-01 12:00:00'),
    ('case2', 'A', '2023-01-02 10:00:00'),
    ('case2', 'B', '2023-01-02 11:00:00'),
    ('case2', 'D', '2023-01-02 12:00:00'),
    ('case3', 'A', '2023-01-03 10:00:00'),
    ('case3', 'B', '2023-01-03 11:00:00'),
    ('case3', 'C', '2023-01-03 12:00:00'),
    ('case4', 'A', '2023-01-04 10:00:00'),
    ('case4', 'B', '2023-01-04 11:00:00'),
    ('case4', 'C', '2023-01-04 12:00:00'),
    ('case5', 'X', '2023-01-05 10:00:00'),
    ('case5', 'Y', '2023-01-05 11:00:00');
    ```

2.  **Run the query:**  Execute the SQL query in your DuckDB environment.  Remember to replace `LIMIT 10` with your desired `K` value (e.g., `LIMIT 2` to get the top 2 variants).

3.  **Analyze the results:** The output will be a set of rows from your original `event_log` table, but only for the cases that belong to the top K most frequent activity sequences (process variants).

This solution efficiently handles the complex task of variant identification, counting, and filtering within a single SQL query.  It leverages window functions and CTEs for clarity and performance.
