The picture is a Petri-net style process model (often called a “workflow net”) that shows how a customer-request case is handled.  
It is divided into two parts:

1. The actual process (upper left).  
2. A legend that explains the routing constructs (lower right).


1. Process part  

Elements  
• White rounded rectangles = activities / tasks (Petri-net transitions).  
• Small filled black circles = conditions / control-flow places.  
• Arrows = causal flow between tasks and conditions.

Flow of the case

a  register request                (start activity)

(routing node) b  examine thoroughly  
                     c  examine casually  
 d  check ticket
(The first task may branch to one, several, or all of these three
 examinations, depending on the split rule that is chosen.)

b, c, d   e  decide                 (their results are synchronised here)

e  decide  can produce three outcomes  
• g  pay compensation  z  end  
• h  reject request    z  end  
• f  re-initiate request  loop back to the examination phase  
  (f feeds tokens back to the places in front of b, c, d, so the file
   can be examined again.)

Thus the process starts with a request, may go through one or more
examination tasks, is decided, and then either ends (payment or
rejection) or is recycled for another round of examination.


2. Legend part  

The grey inset explains the six gateway patterns that can be built with
a Petri net:

XOR-split   – one outgoing branch gets one token.  
AND-split   – every outgoing branch gets a token (parallelism).  
OR-split    – a non-empty subset of outgoing branches gets tokens.  

XOR-join    – the first arriving token lets the downstream flow continue.  
AND-join    – waits for a token on every incoming branch.  
OR-join     – waits for a token on each branch that has actually been taken
              earlier in the case.

These rules are realised in the main diagram by choosing the appropriate
marking behaviour when transition a or transition e fires.


Summary  
The visualisation is a Petri-net description of a request-handling
process with alternative or parallel examinations, a decision point, two
possible completions, and a feedback loop, accompanied by a legend that
shows how XOR, AND and OR splits/joins look in this notation.
