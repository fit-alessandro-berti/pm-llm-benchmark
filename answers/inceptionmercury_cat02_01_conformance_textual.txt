Okay, I understand the task. I need to analyze the event log and identify cases that deviate from the normative process description. Here's my analysis:

**Analysis of Event Log Cases:**

*   **Case 1:** This case follows the normative process perfectly. The sequence is Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close.

*   **Case 2:** This case violates the normative process. The "Package items" activity occurs before "Authorize payment." According to the process description, payment authorization must occur *before* packaging.

    *   **Violation:** "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment."

*   **Case 3:** This case violates the normative process. The "Ship order" activity occurs after "Cancel order." According to the process description, shipping should never occur after a cancellation.

    *   **Violation:** "Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order."

*   **Case 4:** This case follows the normative process for insufficient inventory scenarios. The sequence is Receive, Check, Cancel, Close.

*   **Case 5:** This case violates the normative process. The "Ship order" activity occurs before "Package items." According to the process description, items must be packaged before they can be shipped.

    *   **Violation:** "Ship order" occurred before "Package items."

**Summary of Violations:**

*   **Case 2:** "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment."
*   **Case 3:** "Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order."
*   **Case 5:** "Ship order" occurred before "Package items."

I have identified the cases that violate the normative process and explained the specific violations based on the textual description provided.
