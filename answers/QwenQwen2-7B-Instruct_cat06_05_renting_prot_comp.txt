From the provided data, several significant differences between the process variants for the protected and unprotected groups can be identified:

1. **Job Sampling**: The groups display different frequencies for complete or partial rental processes, which can indicate varying levels of success or outcome. For instance, the protected group's process variant "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" is relatively rare (1), suggesting that a more extensive screening process may be applied only in exceptional cases or for certain types of tenants. Meanwhile, the unprotected group has several instances of this variant, indicating it is a more typical part of their process.

2. **Embedded Variations**: Notably, the protected group includes process variants with over-repetition or specific steps within the workflow —e.g., orchestrating themselves multiple times with "Pay Rent" and other procedural steps— suggesting complex management of different situations or stages within the same account. The unprotected group largely avoids these repetitions, except for the less common occurrences of step "Tenant Cancels Appartment", indicating a less complex or straightforward process flow in general.

3. **Action Speed**: Average times for individual actions vary significantly between groups. Justlyn, the protected group, shows faster completion times (times in thousands), which might indicate improved operational efficiency or reduced transactional overhead. This contrasts with the unprotected group's times, which are generally greater, possibly offering insights about the predominant process model or the Bleakley diversity & inclusion strategy.

4. **Workflow Boundaries**: The prerequisites for entering specific workflows differ between the two groups. For example, specific input triggers such as identifying interest 'Appointed for Appointment', cessation of interest 'Reject Prospective Tenant', or interactions extending into long-term commitments like 'Pay Rent' have more pronounced indicators leading to various outcomes in each group.

5. **Stopping Points**: The protected group has several variation points where a path is terminated at the rejection or cancellation stage. This could reflect a strategy to manage less satisfactory or risky tenant applicants more quickly. In comparison, the unprotected group as a whole, while having a larger volume in terms of cancellations, has fewer segmentation in paths before the cancellation step, potentially outlining a different set of workflow priorities.

6. **Screening and Inspection**: The protected group intertwines extensive screening processes from the beginning or during the application process, suggesting a heightened focus on security or differentiated values. The unprotected group primarily uses standard screening,
