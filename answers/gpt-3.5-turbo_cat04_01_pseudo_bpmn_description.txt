**Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Start Event:** The process starts with receiving a customer request.

2. **Task A - Receive Customer Request:** This task signifies the initial step of the process, where the system captures the customer's request.

3. **Gateway (XOR) - Check Request Type:** This gateway diverges the flow based on whether the request is standard or custom.

4. **Task B1 - Perform Standard Validation:** If the request is standard, this task performs validation checks.

5. **Gateway (AND) - Run Parallel Checks:** Once the standard validation task is passed, two parallel tasks (Credit Check and Inventory Check) are executed simultaneously.

6. **Task C1 - Credit Check:** This task assesses the customer's creditworthiness.

7. **Task C2 - Inventory Check:** This task verifies the availability of the requested inventory.

8. **Task D - Calculate Delivery Date:** After both parallel checks are completed, the system calculates the delivery date based on the assessment.

9. **Task B2 - Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis:** If the request is custom, this task performs a feasibility analysis.

10. **Gateway (XOR) - Is Customization Feasible?:** This gateway determines whether customization is feasible.

11. **Task E1 - Prepare Custom Quotation:** If customization is feasible, this task prepares a custom quotation.

12. **Task E2 - Send Rejection Notice:** If customization is not feasible, a rejection notice is sent to the customer, and the process ends.

13. **Gateway (XOR) - Is Approval Needed?:** This gateway decides whether manager approval is necessary.

14. **Task F - Obtain Manager Approval:** If approval is required, this task involves seeking approval from a manager.

15. **Gateway (XOR) - Is Approval Granted?:** This gateway determines if the manager has approved the request.

16. **Task G - Generate Final Invoice:** If approval is granted, the final invoice is generated.

17. **Task H - Re-evaluate Conditions:** If approval is not granted, or if conditions change, this task triggers a re-evaluation process.

18. **Task I - Send Confirmation to Customer:** Towards the end of the process, a confirmation is sent to the customer.

19. **End Event:** The process concludes after all necessary steps have been completed.

This BPMN representation showcases a structured workflow that handles standard and custom requests differently in parallel paths. It incorporates validation, feasibility analysis, approval processes, and re-evaluation conditions to ensure efficient processing of customer requests. The gateways and conditions in the process ensure that the system follows predefined paths based on the nature of the customer request and the outcome of validation and approval steps.
