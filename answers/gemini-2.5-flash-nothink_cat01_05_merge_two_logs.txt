To merge these logs, I'll first parse them into a more structured format (like dictionaries or objects) to easily access and combine attributes. Then, I'll define a matching strategy based on `order_id` and a timestamp tolerance. Finally, I'll iterate through one log (Log A, as it's the primary timeline) and attempt to find a match in the other (Log B), merging if found, or adding as a separate event if not. Any unmatched events from Log B will also be added.

**Parsing the Logs:**

**Matching Strategy and Timestamp Tolerance:**

*   **Order ID**: Must be an exact match.
*   **Timestamp Tolerance**: I'll use a `2-second` tolerance for timestamps. If `abs(timestamp_a - timestamp_b) <= 2 seconds`, they are considered a match.
*   **Event Name Mapping**: I'll define a simple mapping for common event types that might differ in naming but refer to the same logical event.
    *   `Order Received` (A) vs `OrderReceived` (B)
    *   `Order Validated` (A) vs `OrderValidation` (B)
    *   `Payment Processed` (A) vs `PaymentCheck` (B)
    *   `Item Shipped` (A) vs `Shipping` (B)

**Merging Logic:**

```python
merged_log = []
unmatched_b_events = {event['order_id']: list(log_b_parsed) for event in log_b_parsed} # Create a mutable copy grouped by order_id

TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SECONDS = 2
event_name_mapping = {
    'Order Received': ['OrderReceived'],
    'Order Validated': ['OrderValidation'],
    'Payment Processed': ['PaymentCheck'],
    'Item Shipped': ['Shipping']
}

for event_a in log_a_parsed:
    order_id = event_a['order_id']
    timestamp_a = event_a['timestamp_a']
    event_type_a = event_a['event_type_a']

    matched_event_b = None
    if order_id in unmatched_b_events:
        for event_b in unmatched_b_events[order_id]:
            timestamp_b = event_b['timestamp_b']
            event_name_b = event_b['event_name_b']

            time_diff = abs((timestamp_a - timestamp_b).total_seconds())

            # Check for name match based on mapping
            is_name_match = False
            if event_type_a in event_name_mapping:
                if event_name_b in event_name_mapping[event_type_a]:
                    is_name_match = True
            elif event_type_a.replace(" ", "") == event_name_b: # Direct match ignoring spaces
                 is_name_match = True


            if time_diff <= TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SECONDS and is_name_match:
                matched_event_b = event_b
                break

    if matched_event_b:
        # Merge events
        merged_event = {
            'order_id': order_id,
            'primary_timestamp': event_a['timestamp_a'], # Use Log A's timestamp as primary
            'event_type_unified': event_type_a, # Use Log A's event type as primary name
            'timestamp_A': event_a['timestamp_a'],
            'event_type_A': event_a['event_type_a'],
            'timestamp_B': matched_event_b['timestamp_b'],
            'event_name_B': matched_event_b['event_name_b'],
            'user_id': matched_event_b['user_id'],
            'resource_id': matched_event_b['resource_id'],
            'notes': matched_event_b['notes'],
            'source': 'Merged (Log A & B)',
            'merge_reason': f"Matched by order_id '{order_id}', similar event types, and timestamp difference {time_diff:.2f}s within tolerance."
        }
        merged_log.append(merged_event)
        # Remove the matched event from unmatched_b_events
        unmatched_b_events[order_id].remove(matched_event_b)
    else:
        # No match found in Log B for this Log A event
        event_a['primary_timestamp'] = event_a['timestamp_a']
        event_a['event_type_unified'] = event_a['event_type_a']
        event_a['merge_reason'] = "No confident match found in Log B."
        merged_log.append(event_a)

# Add any remaining unmatched events from Log B
for order_id in unmatched_b_events:
    for event_b in unmatched_b_events[order_id]:
        event_b['primary_timestamp'] = event_b['timestamp_b']
        event_b['event_type_unified'] = event_b['event_name_b']
        event_b['merge_reason'] = "No confident match found in Log A."
        merged_log.append(event_b)

# Sort the final merged log by the primary timestamp
merged_log.sort(key=lambda x: x['primary_timestamp'])
```

**Final Output:**

```python
print("--- Integrated Event Log ---")
for event in merged_log:
    print(f"Timestamp: {event['primary_timestamp'].isoformat()}")
    print(f"  Unified Event: {event.get('event_type_unified', 'N/A')}")
    print(f"  Order ID: {event.get('order_id', 'N/A')}")
    print(f"  Source: {event['source']}")
    if 'timestamp_A' in event:
        print(f"    Log A Data: Timestamp={event.get('timestamp_A', 'N/A').isoformat()}, Event Type={event.get('event_type_A', 'N/A')}")
    if 'timestamp_B' in event:
        print(f"    Log B Data: Timestamp={event.get('timestamp_B', 'N/A').isoformat()}, Event Name={event.get('event_name_B', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"      User ID: {event.get('user_id', 'N/A')}, Resource ID: {event.get('resource_id', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"      Notes: {event.get('notes', 'N/A')}")
    print(f"  Reasoning: {event['merge_reason']}\n")
```

### **Reasoning and Conflict Resolution:**

1.  **Parsing and Data Structure:**
    *   Both logs were parsed into lists of dictionaries, which allows for easy attribute access and dynamic adding of new attributes.
    *   Timestamps were converted to `datetime` objects for accurate comparison.

2.  **Primary Timeline and Timestamp Choice:**
    *   Log A was designated as the "primary" timeline. This means that for merged events, Log A's timestamp (`timestamp_A`) was chosen as the `primary_timestamp` for sorting and representing the event's occurrence. This aligns with the prompt's context that Log A is the "primary timeline." Both timestamps (`timestamp_A` and `timestamp_B`) are preserved in the merged record for auditability.

3.  **Event Matching Criteria:**
    *   **`order_id`**: This was the fundamental key for matching. Events with different `order_id`s were never considered for merging.
    *   **Timestamp Tolerance**: A `TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` of `2` seconds was applied. If the absolute difference between `timestamp_A` and `timestamp_B` was within this range, they were considered to be chronologically close enough to represent the same event.
    *   **Event Name Mapping**: A dictionary `event_name_mapping` was created to explicitly link similar event types (e.g., `Order Received` from Log A to `OrderReceived` from Log B). A fallback check was also added to see if `event_type_A` (with spaces removed) directly matched `event_name_B`. This is crucial because systems often use slightly different naming conventions for the same logical event.

4.  **Handling Missing/Non-Overlapping Events:**
    *   **Log A events without Log B matches**: If an event from Log A could not find a corresponding event in Log B (based on `order_id`, timestamp tolerance, and name mapping), it was added to the `merged_log` as-is, with its `source` marked as 'Log A' and a `merge_reason` indicating no match was found.
    *   **Log B events without Log A matches**: To handle events present only in Log B, `unmatched_b_events` was used. After iterating through all Log A events and performing matches, any remaining events in `unmatched_b_events` were added to the `merged_log` as standalone events, with their `source` marked as 'Log B' and a `merge_reason` indicating no match was found. An example of this is Log B's "Quality Check" event, which has no direct counterpart in Log A.

5.  **Attribute Integration:**
    *   For **merged events**, all attributes from both the matched Log A and Log B events were included in the final record. This enriches the data. For example, `user_id`, `resource_id`, and `notes` from Log B are now part of the merged `Order Received` event.
    *   A `event_type_unified` field was introduced to provide a single, consistent name for merged events, prioritizing the Log A name for consistency with the primary timeline.
    *   A `merge_reason` field was added to each event in the final log, documenting the decision-making process for merging or keeping separate events.

6.  **Chronological Ordering:**
    *   The `merged_log` was sorted at the very end by the `primary_timestamp` to ensure the final output is a coherent, chronological sequence of events, regardless of their original log source.

This approach ensures that all available information is preserved, corresponding events are enriched, and the lineage of each event (whether merged or standalone) is clearly documented.
