Explain the likely deviations from the standard sequence.
*   **Model 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Order of activities:** Model 1 indicates ` Model 1's` nodes activities are done in a specific order.  
    *   * The most severe anomaly is the order of activities where it allows ` Interview activities, the ` Interviews and the screening activities` are performed after the ` Make_Hiring_ decision`  This deviates from normal operations in the process of workflows. This model indicates that the tasks should follow the order.
    *   The model deviates by making the `  `Make_Hiring_Decision` which is a  `  `Onboard_ employees`  before the `Make_Hiring_decision`  `

    *   **Model 2:**
        *   The model represents model's behavior in a **`Hire-to-Retial sequence of activities. It` contains anomalies` which are likely to be deviations.
        the  `Interview' models in the ` Hire to Retails' are done in a specific order as per the model. It `  reveals the structure of events
          *   In the `Hire-to-Retail` model, the ` loop_onboarding` is present, which makes the model a cycle that is, it involves a cycle, which means the process executes the operations, but loops back, to the same activities, if the `Onboard` and `skip`  elements are present.

**Deliverable:**
Answer the following questions with a short text:

*   **Model 
1:**
    *   Describe the process of the model 1.
    *   What are the anomalies present in the model?
*   **Answer:** The model suggests the process will run through a standard sequence of activities and not from the normal workflow of a typical sequence.
    *   *   The main anomaly is the reorder of activities, Specifically, the ` screen` and the ` Interview` which deviates from a normal sequence and the normal flow of events.
    *   *   Another anomaly is the `loop_onboarding` and `xor_payroll`. The `Loop` operator may cause an unusual re-ordering, or a skip to the `xor_payroll` .
        *   The model ` suggests  a `Loop` activity which suggests that there is the possibility for `loop_onboarding` to occur which would be an anomaly.
        *   The model's `xor_payroll` is also an anomaly where activities can be skipped.

*   **Model 2:**
    *   Describe the process of the model 2.
    *   What are the anomalies present in the model?
*   **Answer:** The model deviates from what would normally happen in a standard Hire-to-Retire process.
    *   *   The model `Model 2` has an anomaly of `loop_onboarding`
    *   *   `The model's contains an anomaly of  `xor_payroll`.
    *   *   The `Loop` operator, may cause an unusual re-ordering, or a skip, to the `xor_payroll` .

*   **Which model is closer to a standard Hire-to-Retire process and why?**

*   **Answer:** Model 1  is closer to a standard Hire-to-Retire process.
    *   Model 1 is closer because, although the event order deviates, the model's nodes resemble a standard hire-to-retire process flow.
    *   `Model 2 has loop activities and XOR operators that have the potential to diverge significantly from a typical process flow.
    *    `Model 2's, loop_onboarding`  means you execute  `Onboard` then either exit the loop or repeat  `Onboard` again, making this an anomaly, whereas the `xor_payroll` causes the `Payroll`  activity or `skip`, which can cause issues with the process.
