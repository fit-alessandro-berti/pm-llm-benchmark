Below are two POWL models represented using transitions and operators, as described in the instructions. The first model incorporates a potential source of unfairness through an XOR choice (one branch performing a standard “CulturalFitCheck,” and the other doing a “CommunityAffiliationCheck” that may confer an unfair advantage). The second model removes this source of unfairness, having all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation without any special community-based branch.

In both models, we use the following activity labels from the description:

- **ReceiveApplication**: Initial receiving of the candidate’s application.
- **DataCompletenessCheck**: Check if the application has all required information.
- **RequestMoreInfo**: If data is incomplete, request more info and re-check.
- **SkillAssessment**: Online skill test.
- **CulturalFitCheck**: Standard cultural fit evaluation.
- **CommunityAffiliationCheck**: Specialized cultural fit check that grants an advantage if an applicant has community affiliation (used only in the unfair model).
- **ManagerialReview**: Hiring manager’s final review of borderline candidates.
- **FinalDecision**: Approve or reject the candidate.

The loop is used to represent the repeated data completeness checks and requests for more info until the application data is satisfactory. The XOR is used to represent a branching in the evaluation process.

### Model 1: POWL with Potential Unfairness

**Process Structure (Conceptual):**

1. ReceiveApplication → loop(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo) → SkillAssessment → XOR(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck) → ManagerialReview → FinalDecision

This model introduces an XOR choice after the skill assessment. One branch goes to a standard cultural fit check, while the other uses a community affiliation check that might offer an unfair advantage.

**POWL Code:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Transitions
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop structure for data completeness:
# * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, more_info])

# XOR structure for cultural fit vs community check
xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_affiliation])

# Main partial order
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, loop_node, skill_assessment, xor_node, manager_review, final_decision])

# Add ordering edges:
# ReceiveApplication --> loop_node
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, loop_node)
# loop_node --> SkillAssessment
root_unfair.order.add_edge(loop_node, skill_assessment)
# SkillAssessment --> xor_node
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor_node)
# xor_node --> ManagerialReview
root_unfair.order.add_edge(xor_node, manager_review)
# ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision
root_unfair.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

### Model 2: POWL Without Unfairness

**Process Structure (Conceptual):**

1. ReceiveApplication → loop(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo) → SkillAssessment → CulturalFitCheck → ManagerialReview → FinalDecision

Here, all candidates undergo the same cultural fit check. We remove the XOR branching and the special community-based check to avoid any subtle bias.

**POWL Code:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Transitions
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop structure for data completeness:
# * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, more_info])

# No XOR here, just a single cultural fit check
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, loop_node, skill_assessment, cultural_fit, manager_review, final_decision])

# Add ordering edges:
# ReceiveApplication --> loop_node
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, loop_node)
# loop_node --> SkillAssessment
root_fair.order.add_edge(loop_node, skill_assessment)
# SkillAssessment --> CulturalFitCheck
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit)
# CulturalFitCheck --> ManagerialReview
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)
# ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision
root_fair.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

**Summary:**

- **Model 1 (Unfairness):** Incorporates an XOR branching after the skill assessment, allowing for a “CommunityAffiliationCheck” path that can lead to subtle biases.
- **Model 2 (No Unfairness):** Removes the community-based XOR branching, ensuring all applicants undergo the same “CulturalFitCheck,” thereby reducing the potential for subtle unfairness.
