### Assumptions:

1. **Order Creation Date**: An "Order Created" event was assumed to occur at the time recorded in the `order_date` field in the Orders table.
2. **Items Picking**: Each individual picking event from the Order Lines table was listed separately. As each item was picked, one event was generated per `item_picking_date` for that item.
3. **Deliveries**: If a delivery involved multiple shipments, they were listed separately. "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events were created for each shipment's corresponding `delivery_dispatch_date` and `delivery_arrival_date` to reflect sequence and carrier details.
4. **Invoicing**: Separate invoices were created as separate events, using the `invoice_issue_date`.
5. **Payments**: Each payment for invoices was treated as a separate event, using the `payment_date` and linking it to the matching invoice in the Payments table.

This event log assumes all available data is accurate and complete. If entries were missing, additional steps would be needed to ensure all events are correctly traced from order to completion.
