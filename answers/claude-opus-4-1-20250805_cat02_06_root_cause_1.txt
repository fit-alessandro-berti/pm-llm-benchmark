## Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process

### 1. Case Resolution Time Analysis

Let me first calculate the total resolution time for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Duration | 
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|
| 101 | 2024-03-01 08:00 | 2024-03-01 10:15 | **2 hours 15 minutes** |
| 102 | 2024-03-01 08:05 | 2024-03-02 09:15 | **25 hours 10 minutes** |
| 103 | 2024-03-01 08:10 | 2024-03-01 09:30 | **1 hour 20 minutes** |
| 104 | 2024-03-01 08:20 | 2024-03-02 08:30 | **24 hours 10 minutes** |
| 105 | 2024-03-01 08:25 | 2024-03-03 09:30 | **49 hours 5 minutes** |

**Cases with significantly longer resolution times:**
- **Case 105**: 49+ hours (extreme outlier)
- **Case 102**: 25+ hours (high)
- **Case 104**: 24+ hours (high)

The average for the quick cases (101, 103) is approximately 1.75 hours, making the delayed cases 14-28 times longer.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

#### **Pattern 1: Escalation to Level-2 Agents**
- **Cases 102 and 105** both required escalation to Level-2 agents
- These are also the two longest cases (25+ and 49+ hours respectively)
- **Key finding**: 100% of escalated cases experienced significant delays

#### **Pattern 2: Waiting Time Analysis**

**Case 102 (Escalated):**
- 2.5 hours wait between Level-1 assignment and escalation
- **19-hour overnight delay** between escalation (14:00) and investigation (next day 09:00)
- Investigation to resolution: 19 hours (includes overnight)

**Case 105 (Escalated):**
- Quick initial processing until escalation
- **28-hour delay** between escalation (10:00) and Level-2 investigation (next day 14:00)
- Investigation to resolution: 19 hours (includes overnight)

**Case 104 (Non-escalated but delayed):**
- 40-minute delay for triage (vs. 5-15 minutes for others)
- **3.5-hour delay** between assignment (09:30) and investigation (13:00)
- **19-hour delay** for resolution (13:00 to next day 08:00)

#### **Pattern 3: Time-of-Day Effects**
- Activities after 14:00 often experience overnight delays
- Level-2 agents appear to have limited availability
- Some Level-1 agents may have high workload causing investigation delays

### 3. Key Insights and Recommendations

#### **Primary Bottleneck: Level-2 Agent Availability**
- **Finding**: Level-2 escalations add 20-45+ hours to resolution time
- **Root cause**: Insufficient Level-2 agent capacity or availability
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Increase Level-2 agent staffing
  - Implement on-call rotation for critical hours
  - Consider skill development to promote Level-1 agents

#### **Secondary Issue: Level-1 Agent Workload Distribution**
- **Finding**: Some Level-1 assignments show 3.5-hour delays before investigation
- **Root cause**: Uneven workload distribution or agent availability
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement workload balancing in assignment algorithm
  - Monitor agent queue lengths in real-time
  - Set SLA alerts for investigation start times

#### **Process Improvement Opportunities**

1. **Escalation Criteria Review**
   - Analyze if Level-1 agents could handle more complex issues with training
   - Implement knowledge base to reduce escalation needs

2. **Triage Optimization**
   - Case 104's triage took 40 minutes vs. 5-15 for others
   - Standardize triage procedures and set time targets

3. **24/7 Coverage Assessment**
   - Consider extending Level-2 support hours
   - Implement follow-the-sun support model if serving global customers

4. **SLA Implementation**
   - Set maximum wait times between activities
   - Alert supervisors when tickets exceed thresholds
   - Prioritize tickets approaching SLA breach

#### **Expected Impact**
Addressing these bottlenecks could reduce average resolution time for complex tickets from 25-49 hours to under 8 hours, significantly improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
