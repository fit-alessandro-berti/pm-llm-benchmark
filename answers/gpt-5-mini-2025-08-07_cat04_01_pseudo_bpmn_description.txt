Summary overview
- This process models handling a customer request that can be either a standard product/order or a custom order. It covers validation/feasibility checks, parallel checks for standard requests, calculation or quotation, an approval step if required, possible rework loops, invoice generation, and finally sending confirmation to the customer.
- Key control nodes:
  - XOR gateway = exclusive decision (only one outgoing path taken).
  - AND gateway = parallel split (all outgoing paths executed) and AND join waits for all parallel branches to complete.

Stepbystep explanation (purpose of each element)
1. Start Event
   - The process begins when a customer request arrives.

2. Task A: "Receive Customer Request"
   - Record request details (type, items, customer info, deadlines, pricing constraints).
   - This populates the process data used by subsequent decisions.

3. Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type"
   - Decision based on request attributes (e.g., SKU matches standard products vs. custom engineering required).
   - Only one branch is taken: Standard OR Custom.

Standard path
4. Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"
   - Validate order against standard rules: item codes, pricing, address, basic credit rules, simple business rules.
   - If validation fails there might be an implied error handling (not shown), otherwise proceed.

5. Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"
   - Split into two parallel activities that run concurrently:
     - Task C1: "Credit Check" — verify customer creditworthiness and payment terms.
     - Task C2: "Inventory Check" — confirm stock availability and reservation.
   - These checks run at the same time to shorten lead time.

6. AND Join: "All Parallel Checks Completed"
   - The process waits until both Credit Check and Inventory Check are finished (both must complete, regardless of outcome—exceptions would be handled by their own flows).

7. Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"
   - Use inventory availability, lead times, and any constraints from the checks to set an estimated delivery date for the standard order.

Custom path
4'. Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"
   - Evaluate technical feasibility, capacity, cost, lead time, and whether the custom request can be fulfilled at acceptable terms.

5'. Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"
   - If No  Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"  End Event (process ends for infeasible requests).
   - If Yes  Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation" — produce price, specifications, and lead time for customer approval.

Convergence after Standard or Custom path
- After Task D (standard) or Task E1 (custom quotation) completes, both paths converge to an XOR gateway: "Is Approval Needed?"

Gateway: "Is Approval Needed?"
- Condition-driven choice:
  - If Yes  Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"
  - If No  directly to Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"
- Typical conditions that trigger "Yes": order value above threshold, non-standard pricing, deviations from policy, high-risk customers, public holidays affecting supply, or bespoke technical changes.

Approval branch
1. Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"
   - Send submitted documentation (quotation or calculated delivery date + order facts) to a manager or approval authority.

2. Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"
   - If Yes  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"
   - If No  Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"

3. Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"
   - Re-assess price, delivery, scope, or feasibility in light of the manager’s feedback.
   - Make changes to quotation (custom path) or to delivery calculation/terms (standard path).

Loop-back after re-evaluation
- The process loops back to:
  - Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation) if the original request was Custom; rework produces a revised quotation to present again for approval/acceptance.
  - Task D (Calculate Delivery Date) if the original request was Standard; rework adjusts delivery date/conditions and then may require approval again if conditions still trigger approval.
- This loop can repeat until approval is granted or until an alternative termination (e.g., rejection or cancellation) is reached. The diagram implies repeated iterations but doesn’t show limits — in practice you’d enforce retry limits or an explicit rejection path.

Final steps
- Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"
  - Create the final invoice/order confirmation reflecting approved terms (prices, delivery date, quantities).
- Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"
  - Send invoice/order confirmation and delivery details to the customer.
- End Event
  - Process completes successfully after confirmation; an alternative End Event occurs earlier if customization is infeasible and a rejection notice was sent.

How the gateways control flow (quick reference)
- XOR (exclusive): only one outgoing path taken based on conditions; used for Check Request Type, feasibility decision, Is Approval Needed, and Is Approval Granted.
- AND (parallel): used to run independent checks simultaneously (Credit and Inventory). The AND join synchronizes and waits for both results.

Differences between Standard and Custom requests
- Standard:
  - Goes through standard validation, then parallel operational checks (credit and inventory), and computes a delivery date.
  - Typically simpler, faster, and more automated; approval may be needed only for exceptional circumstances (e.g., high value).
- Custom:
  - Requires feasibility analysis and, if feasible, creation of a custom quotation (more manual, may involve engineering and commercial review).
  - If infeasible  immediate rejection and process ends.
  - If feasible  quotation may require approval and iterative rework to adjust scope/price.

When approvals or rework are triggered
- Approval is triggered by the "Is Approval Needed?" condition. Common triggers:
  - High monetary value transactions
  - Non-standard pricing or discounts
  - Custom or bespoke work
  - Risky customers or policy exceptions
- If approval is denied, the "Re-evaluate Conditions" task is executed, which modifies the quotation (custom) or delivery/terms (standard) and loops back for re-approval. Rework continues until approval or another terminal outcome (rejection/cancellation) occurs.

Operational considerations / assumptions (practical notes)
- The diagram assumes the process retains context (knows whether the case started as Standard or Custom) so it can loop back correctly to D or E1.
- Error and exception handling (e.g., failed credit check, inventory shortfall, timeouts while waiting for approval) aren’t shown but should be modelled in an executable process.
- The AND parallel checks should define how failures are handled: e.g., if Inventory Check fails, do you cancel the order or place a back-order? That influences subsequent paths.
- The approval loop should have stop conditions (max iterations, fallback options) to avoid infinite cycles.

If you want, I can:
- Draw the equivalent BPMN diagram with swimlanes and explicit error paths.
- Suggest specific approval conditions or thresholds tailored to your business.
- Add exception handling for failed checks (credit reject, stockouts), or model timeouts and escalation for approvals.
