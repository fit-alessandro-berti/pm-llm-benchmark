This visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** that describes the workflow of handling an order, involving multiple departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

Here’s a breakdown of the process:

---

### **1. Sales Swimlane**
- **Start event:** The process begins Monday morning.
- **Check order completeness.**
- **Check if the customer is already in the database.**
  - If not, **add the customer to the database.**
- Once the customer is verified, the process continues.
- **Send order details** (message event) to the next process.
- Finally, **draft invoice.**

---

### **2. Production Swimlane**
- Triggered when **order details arrive.**
- **Plan production.**
  - If suitable materials are not available or faulty, it triggers a Procurement process.
- **Manufacture product.**
- Once production is complete, a message is sent to **Warehouse (product complete).**

---

### **3. Procurement Swimlane**
- Triggered when **order details arrive** or when materials are not available.
- **Material Compensation Subprocess:**
  - **Order materials.**
  - If needed, **return materials.**
- **Check materials.**
  - If materials fail, the process may lead to **order cancellation.**

---

### **4. Warehouse Swimlane**
- Triggered when the **product is complete.**
- **Send product** to the customer.
- Produces a **product sent** message, which completes the process.

### **Key Features of the BPMN Diagram:**
- **Pools/Swimlanes:** Separate roles/departments (Sales, Production, Procurement, Warehouse).
- **Events:**
  - Start events (circle).
  - Intermediate message events (envelopes).
  - End events (bold circles).
- **Gateways (diamonds):** Used for decision-making (e.g., checking if customer exists, verifying materials).
- **Message flows (dashed arrows):** Represent communication between departments.
- **Subprocess:** Procurement includes a “Material Compensation Subprocess.”

 **Summary**:  
This BPMN diagram models the **order fulfillment process** across four departments. It starts with validating the order and customer details, proceeds through production planning and procurement (if materials are needed), moves to manufacturing, and ends with the warehouse shipping the completed product and invoicing the customer.

Would you like me to **simplify this into a step-by-step summary** for easier explanation to non-technical stakeholders (e.g., managers/customers)?
