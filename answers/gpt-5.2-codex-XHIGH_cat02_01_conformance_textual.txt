Below is a casebycase check against the two normative paths implied by the description:

**Allowed paths from the text**

1) **Fulfillment path (inventory sufficient):**  
Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close

2) **Cancellation path (inventory insufficient):**  
Receive  Check  Cancel order  Close

Additional rules:
- **Check inventory** must happen before any authorization/fulfillment.  
- **Authorize payment** must occur **before** packaging.  
- **Package items** must occur **before** shipping.  
- **Ship order** must never occur after cancellation.  
- **Close order** must be the final step.

---

##  Conforming cases

**Case 1**  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
 Exactly matches the normal fulfillment sequence.

**Case 4**  
Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
 Matches the cancellation path.

---

##  Deviating cases

### **Case 2**
Receive  Check  **Package**  **Authorize**  Ship  Close  
**Violation:** Packaging happens *before* payment authorization.  
Text says authorization must precede packaging.  
(“Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging.”)

---

### **Case 3**
Receive  Check  Authorize  **Cancel**  **Ship**  Close  
**Violations:**
- Cancellation occurs after authorization instead of directly after inventory check.  
- Shipping occurs **after cancellation**, which is explicitly forbidden.  
- No packaging step prior to shipping.  

This case violates both the cancellation path and the shipping rule.

---

### **Case 5**
Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship**  Close  
**Violation:** Shipping occurs without packaging.  
The text requires packaging **before** shipping.

---

# **Final Answer (Summary)**

**Nonconforming cases:** **2, 3, and 5**

- **Case 2:** Packaging before authorization (wrong order).  
- **Case 3:** Cancellation happens after authorization and is followed by shipping (both forbidden).  
- **Case 5:** Shipping without packaging (missing required step).

**Cases 1 and 4 conform.**
