The main differences between the two groups are:

1. The number of process variants in each group indicates how many different processes can occur during a visit to emergency room (ER) and outpatient department (OPD). In general, a lower frequency means fewer variations.

2. The performance value reflects the success rate of treatment procedures across various departments such as ER, OPD, diagnostic examination etc. A higher performance value means more successful treatments. 

3. In group 1, some processes have only one variant while in group 2, several process variants exist for each department (e.g., Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis). This implies that each department has its own procedures.

4. The groups differ in their discharge frequencies too. Group 1 shows more patients discharged soon after the visit (less than a day), which is likely due to successful treatments and fewer complications, whereas in group 2, many visits lead to prolonged stays or even diagnoses. This suggests that there are more complex cases within group 2.

5. Finally, the number of time series values per patient shows how often different processes occur together (e.g., Register at ER -> Thorough Examination). Higher numbers indicate multiple encounters, possibly due to multi-factorial illnesses or treatment errors.

These differences are indicative of varying degrees of complexity in each department and indicate which groups require more careful follow-up. For instance, a lower frequency in Group 1 suggests fewer complications, whereas the higher frequencies in Group 2 likely mean there's room for improvement.
