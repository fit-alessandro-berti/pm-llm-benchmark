Here's an analysis of the event log, renaming recurring activities to reflect their contextual differences, followed by the revised log and justifications.

### 1. Identification of Recurring Activities and Contextual Meanings

After reviewing the provided event log, the following activities appear multiple times within the same case, with distinct contextual meanings:

*   **`Verify Documents`**: This activity occurs twice in Case C001 and twice in Case C003.
    *   **First Instance (C001, C003)**: The initial `Verify Documents` activity (C001 at 09:20, C003 at 11:25) serves as the primary check of customer-provided documentation for identity or request completeness.
    *   **Second Instance (C001, C003)**: The subsequent `Verify Documents` activity (C001 at 10:30, C003 at 12:20) occurs after additional information has been provided by the customer (C001) or after an internal account adjustment (C003). This indicates a re-verification process to ensure the updated state of the case is correctly documented or approved.

*   **`Call Customer`**: This activity occurs twice in Case C002.
    *   **First Instance (C002)**: The `Call Customer` activity at 09:00 is described as clarifying an "account discrepancy." This suggests a proactive call initiated by the agent to resolve an issue or gather necessary information to proceed.
    *   **Second Instance (C002)**: The `Call Customer` activity at 09:50 is a "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made." This call is made after an internal process step (`Adjust Account`) has been completed, serving to confirm the resolution with the customer.

### 3. Justification for Naming Choices

*   **`Verify Documents`** was renamed to:
    *   **`Initial Document Verification`**: This name reflects the first time documents are checked in a case, as seen in C001 and C003, where it's described as the primary identity or document check.
    *   **`Re-verify Documents`**: This name is used for the second occurrence in C001 and C003. The context clearly indicates these are subsequent checks performed after new information was provided or an internal adjustment was made, necessitating a review of the updated state.

*   **`Call Customer`** (in C002) was renamed to:
    *   **`Call Customer for Clarification`**: This applies to the first call in C002, which aimed to "clarify account discrepancy." The name highlights that the call's purpose was to resolve an ambiguity or gather missing details proactively.
    *   **`Call Customer Follow-up`**: This applies to the second call in C002, described as a "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made." This name clearly indicates it's a post-resolution check to ensure customer acknowledgment and satisfaction after an internal action.
