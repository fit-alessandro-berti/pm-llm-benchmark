The diagram is a detailed flowchart illustrating the process of shipping goods from a computer hardware shop. It is divided into three main sections: Logistics, Dispatch of Goods, and Warehouse. The process begins with the initiation of shipping goods, where the shipment method is clarified. If special handling is required, insurance is checked and, if necessary, the parcel is insured. The package label is then written, and offers from three logistic companies are obtained. A logistic company is selected, and an order is placed. The process then moves to the warehouse section, where goods are packaged. If packaging takes more than 48 hours, the customer is notified about the delay. Once packaged, the shipment paperwork is filled out, and the package is moved to the pickup area, marking the shipment as prepared. The diagram uses various symbols such as diamonds to represent decision points, rectangles for process steps, and arrows to indicate the flow of the process. Overall, the diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the steps involved in shipping goods, highlighting the decision points and the sequence of activities required to complete the process.
