Below are targeted, open-ended questions to clarify and deepen understanding of your property onboarding process. I’ve grouped them by topic so you can answer them in a structured way, but feel free to respond in any order.

Initial contact & intake
- Can you walk me through the very first interactions when a landlord contacts a regional office — who takes the call, what information is captured, and how is the request logged?
- What documentation do you require by policy at intake, and how do you handle documents that vary by city or property type?
- How do you verify the identity and ownership of the landlord? Describe any checks or evidence you require beyond deeds.

Documentation verification & data entry
- How do you decide a document is “outdated” or insufficient, and what specific updates are typically requested?
- Who is responsible for entering property details into the central database, and what fields are mandatory versus optional?
- How do you validate the accuracy of the recorded property attributes (e.g., square footage, unit count, amenities)?

Property manager assignment
- What exact factors are weighted when assigning a property manager (workload, geography, experience, specialty) and how are trade-offs handled?
- Can you describe a scenario where a property manager is passed over due to workload or specialization — what happens next?
- How do you track and update managers’ capacity, geographic coverage, and specialty experience over time?

Introductory meeting & expectation alignment
- What is the typical agenda for the manager-landlord introductory call or meeting?
- How are special landlord requirements (e.g., furnished units, custom clauses, pet policies) documented and propagated to other teams?
- How do you resolve mismatches in expectations discovered during this meeting?

Inspections, repairs & compliance
- How are the photographer and certified inspector scheduled and coordinated with the landlord and manager?
- What standards or checklists do inspectors use, and how are inspection findings classified by severity?
- When issues are found, how do you decide whether the company arranges repairs, the landlord arranges them, or the property is rejected?

Marketing & pricing
- How is the initial pricing range determined and who approves it? What inputs or market signals are used?
- How do you decide which marketing channels and materials to use for different property types or markets?
- How often do you revisit pricing after activation, and who owns that decision?

Activation in portal & systems
- What exactly changes in your systems when a property is “activated” — what is visible to public vs internal users?
- How do you ensure data consistency across the central database, rental portal, CRM, and any third-party listing sites?
- What controls exist to prevent a property from being activated prematurely (e.g., before inspection passes or documents are complete)?

Tenant screening & leasing
- What are your screening criteria and how are exceptions (e.g., borderline credit, alternative income proof) evaluated?
- How are competing applications prioritized and what negotiation levers (promotions, lease length) are typically used?
- Who drafts and approves lease templates, and how are landlord-specific clauses incorporated while maintaining compliance?

Financials, deposits & payment flows
- How is the security deposit handled (custody, accounting) and who reconciles it?
- What payment channels do you offer for rent and fees, and how are landlord preferences configured?
- How is the agreed rental price evaluated by the financial analyst against profitability targets — what inputs and tolerances are used?

Quality checks, compliance & audits
- What is the scope and timing of the compliance officer’s lease review relative to lease-signing?
- How often are internal audits performed on new onboardings, and what common issues do they surface?
- How do you document and close audit findings or compliance exceptions?

Roles, responsibilities & handoffs
- Can you map the key roles involved from intake to move-in, and where the formal handoffs occur?
- Who is the single point of accountability for ensuring onboarding milestones are completed?
- How are responsibilities split between regional offices and central teams (IT, marketing, finance, legal)?

Exceptions, escalations & special cases
- What are your defined exception types (special insurance needs, custom clauses, conditional approvals), and how is each handled?
- What is the escalation path for unresolved issues or landlord disputes, and who has final decision authority?
- How frequently do special-case properties occur and how do they affect timelines or costs?

Timing, SLAs & throughput
- What are your target SLAs for each major phase (documentation verification, inspection, marketing, activation, tenant placement)?
- How do you measure and manage bottlenecks in the onboarding pipeline?
- What is the average total time from initial contact to first tenant move-in, and what causes significant variance?

Communication & tracking
- How is communication tracked across stakeholders (landlord, manager, contractors, support teams)? Which channels are primary?
- What information or status updates are routinely shared with landlords, and how often?
- How do you prevent or resolve communication breakdowns between regional and central teams?

Data quality, privacy & security
- What data validation or quality checks are run on property and landlord data before activation?
- How do you handle sensitive information (IDs, financial documents) and what are your privacy safeguards?
- How are data changes audited and who can modify critical fields?

Performance metrics & continuous improvement
- What KPIs do you track for the onboarding process (time-to-activate, conversion rate, inspection pass rate, landlord satisfaction)?
- How do you collect feedback from landlords and tenants about the onboarding experience, and how is that feedback used?
- Can you describe a recent process change you made and what drove that change?

Legal, insurance & regulatory
- How do you ensure local housing regulations and permitting requirements are met across multiple cities?
- How are insurance requirements determined and evidenced, and what happens if a landlord cannot obtain required coverage?
- How do you handle differing legal lease requirements in different jurisdictions?

Post-onboarding & handoff to operations
- What ongoing responsibilities does the assigned property manager retain after move-in versus what transitions to operations or maintenance teams?
- How do you confirm the property has been successfully handed off into regular management workflows?

Risk management & contingency planning
- What are your main onboarding risks (financial, legal, reputational) and how are they mitigated?
- Do you maintain contingency plans for failed inspections, prolonged vacancies, or contractor unavailability?

Prioritization & capacity planning
- How do you prioritize which properties to onboard first if resources are limited?
- How do you forecast and plan capacity for photographers, inspectors, and managers during peak periods?

Closing/summary questions
- What are the most frequent pain points or delays you encounter, and what would you change if resources were unlimited?
- Are there any informal or ad-hoc steps your teams take that aren’t captured in the formal process description?
- What examples can you share of particularly challenging onboardings and how your organization resolved them?

If helpful, I can reformat these into a short interview script or a checklist grouped by the onboarding stages so you can use them directly in a follow-up session.
