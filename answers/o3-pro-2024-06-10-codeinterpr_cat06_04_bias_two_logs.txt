Short answer  
The bias is visible in the Group B (Unprotected-group) log.  
Applicants in that log receive systematic score uplifts that are never given to otherwise comparable applicants in the Group A (Protected-group) log. Because those uplifts depend on attributes that correlate with group membership (LocalResident = TRUE and belonging to a named CommunityGroup), they raise the final scores—and therefore the likelihood of approval—only for the unprotected group. The protected group is structurally excluded from the same benefit.

Detailed comparison  

1. LocalResident  
   • Group A: always FALSE  
   • Group B: always TRUE  

   This immediately separates the two populations. Any rule that gives extra credit to local residents will be facially neutral but will operate only in Group B.

2. CommunityGroup  
   • Group A: None for every case  
   • Group B: “Highland Civic Darts Club” for two of the three cases  

   Membership in a community group is therefore unavailable to the protected group. In the unprotected group it appears hand-in-hand with LocalResident = TRUE.

3. ScoreAdjustment  
   • Group A: always 0  
   • Group B: +10 whenever CommunityGroup is present, otherwise 0  

   The +10 “Community Boost” is the direct mechanism of bias. It increases the preliminary score for some unprotected applicants but never for protected applicants.

4. How the adjustment affects decisions  

   Preliminary   Final   Final  
   score         score    decision  
   --------------------------------  
   P001  720    720    Approved  
   U001  720    730    Approved (same starting risk, higher ending score)

   P002  710    710    Rejected  
   U002  710    710    Rejected (no community boost, same outcome)

   P—     —   (no case)  
   U003  695    705    Approved (community boost flips the decision)

   • U003 demonstrates disparate impact: a below-threshold preliminary score (695) is pushed above the apparent 700–720 cut-off and the applicant is approved.  
   • A protected applicant with 695 would have remained below the threshold and been rejected, but there is no mechanism for that applicant to obtain the same boost.

5. Why this is bias  
   a. Direct effect: A rule that grants +10 if (LocalResident AND CommunityGroup) is formally group-neutral but, in practice, applies only to the unprotected group because the protected group never meets the condition.  
   b. Disparate treatment: Two otherwise identical applicants (same preliminary score, same data quality) are treated differently based solely on attributes that correlate with protected status.  
   c. Disparate impact: The adjustment changes the distribution of final scores, allowing lower-quality unprotected cases to be approved while preventing protected cases from achieving the same threshold.

6. Potential fairness problems  
   • Equal-treatment violation: Group membership determines access to the boost.  
   • Calibration/score neutrality: Final scores are no longer calibrated across groups; a 730 in Group B may reflect the same underlying risk as a 720 in Group A.  
   • Individual fairness: “Similar individuals should be treated similarly” fails when community affiliation (which is not directly related to creditworthiness) overrides the raw score only for one group.

Conclusion  
The event log for Group B contains an embedded rule (“Community Boost” contingent on LocalResident = TRUE and CommunityGroup  None) that confers a systematic advantage exclusively on the unprotected group. Group A never receives comparable adjustments, so applicants in the protected group face a higher effective approval threshold. This constitutes a clear case of bias in the decision process.
