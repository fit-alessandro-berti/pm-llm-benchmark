The only cases that deviate from the normative description are 2, 3 and 5.  Here is how each one violates the intended flow:

1. Case 1  
   - Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
   - Status: fully compliant with the “instock” scenario.

2. Case 2  
   - Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close  
   - Violations:  
     a) “Package items” occurs before “Authorize payment.”  Normative rule: you may only package once you know payment is approved.  
     b) “Authorize payment” slips in after packaging, so the packagebeforepayment rule is inverted.

3. Case 3  
   - Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close  
   - Violations:  
     a) In an “outofstock” (cancellation) branch, you must not authorize payment—authorization only makes sense when inventory is sufficient.  
     b) “Ship order” after “Cancel order” is illogical: once an order is canceled it must go straight to “Close,” no shipping.

4. Case 4  
   - Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
   - Status: perfectly matches the “insufficient inventory” branch.

5. Case 5  
   - Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close  
   - Violations:  
     a) Missing “Package items” entirely. Normative rule: you must package before you ship.  
     b) “Ship order” directly after payment authorization skips the required preparation step.

Summary of rule breaches:  
- You must always run “Check inventory” before any authorize/package/ship.  
- “Authorize payment” only in the instock branch, and only before packaging.  
- “Package items” only after authorization and must precede shipping.  
- “Ship order” never follows a cancellation and always follows a packaging step.  
- “Close order” must be the last activity.  
Cases 2, 3 and 5 each violate one or more of these constraints.
