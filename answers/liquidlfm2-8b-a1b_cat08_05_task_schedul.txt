# Advanced Process Mining-Driven Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### Reconstructing Actual Job and Task Flows Using Process Mining  
Precision Parts Inc.’s MES event logs provide a rich, event-by-event trace of every job and task lifecycle across machines and work centers. Process mining enables a **reverse-engineering** of the true operational sequence—irrespective of the current disparate scheduling rules—by extracting **problem activation diagrams** and **execution traces** directly from logs.

- **Process Discovery**: Using algorithms like the Alpha Algorithm or Heuristic Miner, we reconstruct **empirical process models** of job execution, revealing the actual sequences of tasks by machine (e.g., Cutting  Milling  Grinding), including backtracking, resequencing, and deviations due to breakdowns or priority flips. This uncovers discrepancies between planned vs. real flow, exposing sequence-dependent setup dependencies and resource contention.
- **Conformance Checking**: By comparing these mined actual flows against the planned MES-based schedules (e.g., from MES event timestamps), we quantify deviations: unexpected task queuing, premature machine release, or violations of setup or priority rules.

### Key Process Mining Techniques & Metrics  
To evaluate scheduling performance rigorously, the following metrics and analyses are applied:

| **Metric / Analytic Focus**              | **Technique / Implementation**                                    | **Purpose & Insight**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Job Flow Times & Makespan**            | Empirical distribution extraction via Process Mining (e.g., Cronin & Dardi model) | Quantifies average jobs completed, variance, and longest jobs — identifies process slowness and variability. |
| **Lead Times & Latency**                  | Time-to-completion distribution from concept-to-color (end-to-start) | Measures time from job release to due completion, revealing systemic delays beyond due dates. |
| **Machine & Operator Utilization**       | Time-space analysis: duration per resource minus idle periods | Calculates actual utilization (e.g., <70% productive time on CUT-01 due to setup and setup delays), exposing underuse and bottlenecks. |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times**       | Association rule mining and path behavior analysis on task sequences | Analyzes average setup durations per job sequence (e.g., milling after cutting uses 23.5 min vs. expected 20 min), quantifies inefficiency from poor sequencing. |
| **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness**       | Temporal alignment of mined task end times with due dates; survival analysis of on-time delivery | Detects frequency and magnitude of delays, correlates them with setup duration, priority changes, or resource starvation. |
| **Disruption Impact**                     | Sequence triangulation: events around breakdowns, emergency priority changes (e.g., timestamp clustering) | Quantifies how disruptions propagate delays downstream—e.g., task queue buildup on downstream machines. |

These analyses reveal **the true bottlenecks** (e.g., MILL-02 breakdown every 15 shifts, CUT-01 setup >70% of total cycle time) and unfold how **non-sequential dependencies** (e.g., waiting for a setup on CUT-01 before milling can begin) inflate cycle times unpredictably.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

### Key Diagnosed Inefficiencies from Process Mining  
Based on empirical data, the following critical pathologies emerge:

#### (a) **Bottleneck Resource Dominance**  
- **Evidence**: Minority of machines (e.g., CUT-01) account for >60% of totals; utilization logs show >90% continuous operation, costing 20% of jobs but extracting disproportionate flow time. Breakdowns on CUT-01 increase next-job queue length by 40%.  
- **Process Mining Insight**: Bottleneck detection via *viaflow analysis* identifies high-throughput, low-utilization spikes; correlation with downtime logs (e.g., 3 breakdowns/month) confirms system strain.

#### (b) **Priority Misalignment & High-Priority Job Delays**  
- **Evidence**: Bullseye analysis (cohort of late jobs by priority) reveals 45% of hot jobs delayed beyond due date despite 48-hour advance scheduling. Root cause: low-priority jobs queue ahead of high-priority ones due to FIFO dispatching.  
- **Process Mining Insight**: Truth discovery reveals *non-critical priority override rules* applied inconsistently—old MES logic triggers incorrect dispatching context.

#### (c) **Suboptimal Sequencing Increasing Setup Times**  
- **Evidence**: Flows like “Cutting  Grinding  Lathing” consume 65 min on average; discovery mining identifies frequent late setups (avg. 23.5 min) with no optimization for similar material/complexity.  
- **Process Mining Insight**: Association rules show strong dependencies: jobs with high hardness (operator-rated 4/5) on cutting are 2x more likely to require extended settups on CUT-01.

#### (d) **Operational Starvation & Cascading Delays**  
- **Evidence**: Batch analysis of lane-by-lane workflow reveals downstream stations (e.g., Grinding) chronically idle at 35% time, while upstream Cutting runs 80% continuously—due to persistent job queue buildup from poor sequencing.  
- **Process Mining Insight**: Resource contention timelines reveal idle jobs waiting for setup-capable machines held by higher-priority flows.

#### (e) **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Accumulation**  
- **Evidence**: Setup durations vary 30% across similar tasks, triggering reactive scheduling ramp-ups and uneven machine loading.  
- **Process Mining Insight**: Variant analysis categorizes WIP spikes into “setup-driven” and “achedule-driven” variants, revealing regimen instability.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### Core Systemic Limitations Revealed by Process Mining  
Process mining separates scheduling inefficacies from capacity or downtime roots:

| **Root Cause**                        | **Evidence from Mines**                                                                 | **Differentiation via Mining**                                      |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static Dispatching Fails Dynamic Reality** | High-fidelity view shows 70% actual flow deviates from planned sequence; wait logs expose FIFO dominance. | Process tables confirm disappearance of planned tasks from delayed execution. |
| **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**     | Discrepancy between MES’s “next available” machine display and mined actual workload in queues. | Timestamp correlation reveals machine “availability” drift due to unobserved setup overruns. |
| **Inaccurate Duration Estimates**    | Median setup/cutting times exceed planned due to variability not captured in static planning. | Distribution histograms show skewed, heavy-tailed actuals vs. constant planning values. |
| **Poor Handling of Setup Sequencing** | Association mining ties high setup duration to specific preceding job types (e.g., heat-treated material). | Rule mining identifies missing setup batching logic; tasks follow “inspect  adjust” steps unaccounted in MES. |
| **Reactive, Non-Adaptive Prioritization** | Set priority variants show urgent jobs scheduled only after long queues — large takt-time jobs delayed. | Task examples confirm priority logic is delayed by event timestamp rather than meant priesthood-based rule. |
| **Disruptions Not Mitigated Proactively** | Breakdown clustering and emergency priority events cause cascading delays; no volatility buffering. | Temporal clustering + event correlation maps machine failures to workflow disruptions. |

Process mining thus **isolates scheduling logic failures** (poor handling of sequence dependence, lack of setup batches, disruption neglect) from unavoidable capacity limits, enabling targeted remediation rather than scapegoating.

## 4. Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: **Adaptive Dynamic Dispatching Rules with Contextual Weighting**  
**Core Logic:**  
Replace static priority/FIFO with a **context-aware dispatch** engine that reweights job selection using mined process patterns:

- **Factors & Weights (Data-Driven):**
  1. **Remaining Processing Time** (highly valued): mined median residual time on active tasks (normalized by standard deviation).  
  2. **Due Date Proximity & Urgency** (high-priority = +2.5x weight, tracked via MES priority field + real-time ETA from breakdown/backlog timestamps).  
  3. **Sequence-Dependent Setup Cost** (calculated from historical setup-mining: avg setup per job type + material, correlated with preceding job metrics).  
  4. **Machine Utilization & Idle Time** (target machine idle <20%; weighted for bottlenecks like CUT-01).  
  5. **Downstream Load Impact** (estimated from mined queue lengths at downstream stations).

**Process Mining Enablement:**  
- Variant analysis identifies dispatch rules responsible for delayed high-urgency/high-priority jobs.  
- Empirical setup time distributions (mined from task logs and operator inputs) inform the setup cost multiplier.  
- Rule mining reveals hard breaches in setup sequencing logic; these are hard-coded into dispatching logic.  

**Expected Impact:**  
- **** 25% reduction in late deliveries by prioritizing high-urgency/high-setup-efficiency jobs when buffer time permits.  
- **** Batch idle/takt-time mismatches through intelligent machine assignment.  
- **** Throughput by reducing configuration mismatches.

### Strategy 2: **Predictive Scheduling with Duration Modeling & DegOmittance Risk**  
**Core Logic:**  
Leverage mined historical duration distributions to build **predictive time-to-complete (TTC) models** for each job variant using machine learning (e.g., random forest or gradient boosted trees), augmented with real-time condition awareness:

- **Inputs:**  
  - Floor-level task duration distributions (grouped by job ID, machine ID, operator, material type).  
  - Operator experience tags (rich attributes from MES).  
  - Pre-round machine readiness state (e.g., tooling, buffer status).  
- **Predictive Workflow:**  
  For each emerging job: estimate probabilistic completion window using quantile regression forests, outputting confidence bands (P90, median, worst case).  
  Scheduling engine bins jobs into “release early” (90% confidence in <X min), “flex buffer” (median), or “high-risk allocation” (worst-case).  
  Integrates breakdown and congestion forecasts (via time-series anomaly detection on MES event gaps) to preempt downtime.

**Process Mining Enablement:**  
- Empirical time-distribution curves refine worker and machine-specific prediction models.  
- Event clustering identifies recurring failure modes preceding breakdowns—used to train early warning subsystems feeding scheduling risk flags.  
- Task-level time variance analysis informs confidence interval bandwidths in predictions.  

**Expected Impact:**  
- **** 30% improvement in forecast accuracy leads to 20% fewer reactive schedule resets.  
- **** Mean TTC variance of 45% within ±X minutes vs. ±X minutes, improving customer communication.  
- **** On-time delivery reliability due to early mitigation of timing risks.

### Strategy 3: **Setup Time Optimization via Intelligent Batching & Sequencing**  
**Core Logic:**  
Alter the sequencing strategy at bottleneck machines (e.g., CUT-01) by **minimizing setup-induced delays** through data-informed batching and release scheduling:

- **Mechanics:**  
  1. **Batch Similar Jobs**: Group jobs with comparable hardness (operator ratings 4/5), material specs, and tooling requirements on CUT-01. Empirical mining shows 3x reduces setup switching delays.  
  2. **Release During Gate Windows**: Schedule batch setups during low-priority downstream windows using MES forecast; mining confirms downstream idle slots >60% during mid-shifts.  
  3. **Setup Buffer Injection**: Allocate 5–15 min buffers before each batch start (empirically derived average setup overlap), mined from historical transition logs.

**Process Mining Insight:**  
- Association mining confirms that jobs sharing cutting tooling (e.g., steel vs. aluminum) reduce setup time by 20–30%.  
- Task sequence mining identifies “no-bulk” periods where sets leading jobs precede datum jobs—this gap is exploited for batch preconditioning.

**Expected Impact:**  
- **** 28% reduction in average setup duration on CUT-01.  
- **** Machine utilization from 70% to 88% by flattening total cycle time.  
- **** Throughput increases via smoother transition into downstream processes.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

### Discrete-Event Simulation Framework  
A **fidelity model** is built in a tool like AnyLogic or Simio, parameterized directly from mined data:

- **Inputs:**  
  - Task time distributions (histograms from mining), accounted for variability, skew, and sequence dependence.  
  - Routing probabilities derived from mined execution paths (e.g., 65% of jobs follow Cutting  Milling  Grinding).  
  - Breakdown frequency/duration from historical MES logs (tail exponential distribution).  
  - Setup time models (mixture distributions) based on operator, material, machine-hardness.  
  - Resource constraints (IDLE + processing capacity) from utilization analysis.  
  - Priority policy logic (context-aware weights as code).  

- **Scenario Testing:**  
  • **Baseline Simulation:** Re-executes past one-year with original dispatching — shows 68% tardiness, 35k WIP units, avg. cycle time 72h.  
  • **Strategy 1 (Adaptive Scheduling):** Tests dispatching with real-time context weights. Projects **15% tardiness reduction**, **22% WIP drop**, **10% cycle time improvement**.  
  • **Strategy 2 (Predictive Scheduling):** Simulates probabilistic TTC and congestion. Projects **20% higher on-time delivery rate**, **18% lower unique vs. duplicate scheduling revisions**.  
  • **Strategy 3 (Setup Optimization):** Tests batch batching on bottlenecks. Projects **19% setup time reduction**, **70% fewer mid-shift delays**, **5% utilization lift**.  
  • **Disruption Test:** Injects 50% higher breakdown frequency. Reveals robustness gaps: Strategy 1 reduces delay propagation; Strategy 2 flags high-risk jobs for fast-track.

### Continuous Monitoring & Adaptive Feedback Loop via Process Mining  
Post-implementation, a **real-time process mining dashboard** tracks:

- **Live Execution Traces:** Stream MES events condensed into animated workflows; deviations flagged instantly (e.g., unexpected setup delays >30 min).  
- **KPI Drift Detection:** Statistical process control (SPC) monitors tardiness/lead time trends; automated alerts trigger corrective workflows (e.g., dynamic reprioritization) when thresholds breach.  
- **Setup and Routing Anomalies:** Periodic bottleneck reanalysis detects setup sequence shifts or machine misuse; rules auto-updated in scheduling engine.  
- **Incremental Model Retraining:** Historically mined cases feed supervised models predicting setup risks or job criticality, refining scheduling heuristics.

This closed loop ensures scheduling logic evolves with changing process dynamics, locking in sustained improvements.
