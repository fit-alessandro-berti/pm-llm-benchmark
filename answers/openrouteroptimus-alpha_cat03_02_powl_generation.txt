**Explanation of structure:**

- `SR  CS  (DA & ACI in parallel)  [BNC LOOP D&R]  (CD XOR MD)  (QA & SA in parallel)  GLA`
- Loops (via LOOP operator) and choices (via XOR operator) use `OperatorPOWL` as per POWL definition.
- Parallel/concurrent activities (partial order with no edge between nodes) use `StrictPartialOrder`.
- The entire flow is a `StrictPartialOrder` where each main phase is a node, and edges enforce the required sequence between phases.
- The final approval is ensured to occur after both QA and SA.

**Note:**  
If you want to avoid a nested strict partial order for QA/SA, you could substitute `post_deployment_PO` directly into the main structure if desired, but grouping them helps clarity.
