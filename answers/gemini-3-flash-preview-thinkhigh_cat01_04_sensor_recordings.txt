Based on an analysis of the sensor data patterns, I have categorized the event log into seven distinct phases. Here is the process mining breakdown of the manufacturing cycle for Machine M1.

### Process Summary Table

| Event Range | Assigned Activity Label | Rationale for Label |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 – 3** | **Machine Idling / Standby** | Ambient temperature, zero vibration, zero flow, and minimal energy draw indicate the machine is powered on but inactive. |
| **4 – 6** | **Cutting / Machining** | Rapid increase in vibration and temperature, combined with a progressive change in tool position (5mm to 10mm) and high material flow. |
| **7 – 8** | **Assembly / Part Joining** | Vibration drops, tool position stabilizes, and pressure increases to 2 bar, suggesting parts are being pressed or held together. |
| **9** | **Welding / Thermal Fusion** | A massive spike in temperature (80°C) and energy consumption (5.0 kWh) with zero material flow indicates a high-heat stationary task. |
| **10** | **Cooling / Stabilization** | Sharp drop in temperature and energy while the tool remains in position; the machine is "resting" after the high-heat weld. |
| **11 – 12** | **Quality Inspection / Packaging** | Material flow resumes at a low rate and tool moves to its final position (20mm) with low energy, suggesting movement to a discharge area. |
| **13 – 15** | **Reset / Cycle Completion** | All sensors return to baseline (0 vibration, 0 flow, 0 position), indicating the machine has reset for the next part. |

### Detailed Analysis & Deduction Rationale

#### 1. Machine Idling (Events 1–3)
*   **Observations:** Temperature is at 20°C (room temp), energy is <0.5 kWh, and all mechanical sensors (Vibration, Flow, Tool Position) are at 0.
*   **Deduction:** This is the baseline state. The machine is awaiting a command or a new workpiece.

#### 2. Cutting / Machining (Events 4–6)
*   **Observations:** Vibration levels jump to 30–38 Hz, and the tool position is actively changing (5mm $\rightarrow$ 7mm $\rightarrow$ 10mm). Material flow is high (5 units/s).
*   **Deduction:** The movement of the tool combined with high vibration and rising heat indicates friction-based work. The flow rate suggests raw material is being fed into a cutting head.

#### 3. Assembly / Part Joining (Events 7–8)
*   **Observations:** The tool stops moving (stays at 15mm), vibration drops significantly (10 Hz), but **pressure increases** to 2 bar.
*   **Deduction:** Increased pressure with reduced vibration suggests the machine is no longer cutting but is instead pressing two components together. The material flow remains low as the parts are positioned.

#### 4. Welding (Event 9)
*   **Observations:** A massive energy spike to 5.0 kWh (the highest in the log) and a temperature surge to 80°C. Material flow stops completely.
*   **Deduction:** High-intensity energy and heat concentrated in a stationary position are classic signatures of an electrical weld or thermal fusion process.

#### 5. Cooling (Event 10)
*   **Observations:** Temperature drops from 80°C to 30°C in five seconds. Vibration and flow are near zero. 
*   **Deduction:** This is a "dwell time" common after welding, allowing the joint to solidify before the tool releases the part.

#### 6. Quality Inspection / Packaging (Events 11–12)
*   **Observations:** The tool moves to its maximum position (20mm), and energy/flow shows a small, steady increase.
*   **Deduction:** This represents the removal of the finished part from the work area. The low-intensity activity is consistent with a sensor-based quality check or a conveyor moving the part to the packaging stage.

#### 7. Reset (Events 13–15)
*   **Observations:** All readings return to the exact values seen in Events 1–3.
*   **Deduction:** The tool has retracted to the "Home" position (0mm), and the machine is ready for the next cycle.
