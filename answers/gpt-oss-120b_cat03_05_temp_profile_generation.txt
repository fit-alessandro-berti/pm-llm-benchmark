We need to produce a Python dictionary with estimated average times and std devs for pairs of activities in the supply chain. Should not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt? Actually the user says "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." Means we should generate estimated numbers ourselves, not copy from prompt. So we need to produce dictionary with plausible numbers (seconds, hours, days). Provide subset of pairs, including non-direct pairs. Use realistic estimates. Provide code block with python dict. Ensure formatting: code block with language python, proper formatting, numbers. Use LaTeX for any math? Not needed. Provide explanation? Probably just dictionary. Could also include comments. Ensure not too long lines >80 chars. Use Prettier style. Let's craft.

We'll include pairs like ('SS','OP'), ('SS','RC'), ('OP','RC'), ('OP','QI'), ('RC','QI'), ('RC','CA'), ('QI','CA'), ('QI','PT'), ('CA','PT'), ('PT','PK'), ('PK','WS'), ('WS','DT'), ('DT','AS'), plus longer distance pairs like ('SS','CA'), ('SS','PT'), ('OP','PK'), ('RC','WS'), ('QI','DT'), ('CA','AS'), etc.

Provide average times in seconds: e.g., 2 days = 172800 sec, std dev 1 day = 86400 sec. Use plausible numbers.

Make sure lines not exceed 80 chars. Use line breaks.

Let's craft dictionary with maybe 20 entries.

Will include comments? Could include inline comments after each entry, but that may exceed line length. Use separate comment lines.

Will output code block.

Here is a representative temporal‑profile dictionary for the global‑supply‑chain process.  
The values are **estimated** average delays (in seconds) together with a plausible
standard‑deviation that reflects the variability typically observed in such
operations.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly consecutive activities
    ("SS", "OP"): (2 * 24 * 3600, 0.5 * 24 * 3600),   # supplier selection → order placement
    ("OP", "RC"): (5 * 24 * 3600, 1 * 24 * 3600),    # order placement → receive components
    ("RC", "QI"): (1 * 24 * 3600, 0.5 * 24 * 3600),  # receive components → quality inspection
    ("QI", "CA"): (0.5 * 24 * 3600, 0.25 * 24 * 3600),# inspection → component assembly
    ("CA", "PT"): (1 * 24 * 3600, 0.5 * 24 * 3600),  # assembly → product testing
    ("PT", "PK"): (0.25 * 24 * 3600, 0.125 * 24 * 3600),# testing → packaging
    ("PK", "WS"): (0.125 * 24 * 3600, 0.0625 * 24 * 3600),# packaging → warehouse storage
    ("WS", "DT"): (2 * 24 * 3600, 1 * 24 * 3600),    # storage → distribution
    ("DT", "AS"): (7 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),    # distribution → after‑sales support

    # Pairs separated by one intermediate step
    ("SS", "RC"): (7 * 24 * 3600, 1.5 * 24 * 3600),
    ("OP", "QI"): (6 * 24 * 3600, 1.2 * 24 * 3600),
    ("RC", "CA"): (1.5 * 24 * 3600, 0.75 * 24 * 3600),
    ("QI", "PT"): (1.5 * 24 * 3600, 0.8 * 24 * 3600),
    ("CA", "PK"): (1.25 * 24 * 3600, 0.6 * 24 * 3600),

    # Longer‑range pairs (multiple steps in between)
    ("SS", "CA"): (10 * 24 * 3600, 2 * 24 * 3600),
    ("SS", "PT"): (11 * 24 * 3600, 2.5 * 24 * 3600),
    ("OP", "PK"): (8 * 24 * 3600, 1.8 * 24 * 3600),
    ("RC", "WS"): (4 * 24 * 3600, 1 * 24 * 3600),
    ("QI", "DT"): (6 * 24 * 3600, 1.5 * 24 * 3600),
    ("CA", "AS"): (12 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),

    # Very distant pairs (covering most of the process)
    ("SS", "DT"): (15 * 24 * 3600, 4 * 24 * 3600),
    ("OP", "AS"): (20 * 24 * 3600, 5 * 24 * 3600),
}
```

*Each tuple is `(average_time_seconds, standard_deviation_seconds)`.  
The numbers are deliberately coarse (days expressed in seconds) to reflect the
typical variability of a global, multi‑stage supply‑chain workflow.*
