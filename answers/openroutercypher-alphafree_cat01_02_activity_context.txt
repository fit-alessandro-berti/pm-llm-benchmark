To achieve the task, I'll perform the following steps:

1. **Identify repeated activities**: Notice which activities appear multiple times within the same case.

2. **Assess context and timing**: Consider the contextual clues and the position of each activity.

3. **Rename activities**: Create contextually distinct names for each recurring activity that reflects their role or purpose at that particular point in the process.

Let's begin by considering the different activities and their occurrences.

### Case-by-case analysis for each activity

#### Case C001:
- **Verify Documents** (2 occurrences):
  1. Initial document verification by Agent (incomplete).
  2. Re-checking documents after customer submits the additional required ID scan.

- **Call Customer** (1 occurrence):
  - A call to request missing documents.

#### Case C002:
- **Call Customer** (2 occurrences):
  1. Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.
  2. Follow-up call to confirm adjustments.

- **Verify Documents** (1 occurrence):
  - Identity verification without additional submission.

#### Case C003:
- **Verify Documents** (2 occurrences):
  1. Initial physical verification of ID.
  2. Re-verification after making internal account adjustments.

- **Call Customer** (1 occurrence):
  - A call made to request the customer's return to the branch.

### Rename the activities to reflect contextual differences

Here’s the updated event log with the activities renamed:

### Contextual Clues and Justification

- **Initial vs. Retry Document Verification (C001)**\
  The activity "Verify Documents" means different things when it happens the second time (after the customer uploads additional documents). Thus, *Initial Document Verification* vs. *Document Verification Retry*.

- **Different purposes of calls (C001, C003, C002)**\
  Calls occur in various contexts:
  - *Request Missing Documents Call* (C001): To request more information.
  - *Customer Recall Call* (C003): To bring the customer back to the branch.
  - *Discrepancy Clarification Call* (C002) and *Adjustment Confirmation Call* (C002): Different stages of communication regarding account issues.

- **Account Adjustment Naming (C002, C003)**\
  Clearly distinguish internal account changes and their related document verification by renaming:
  - In C002, *Adjust Account* is renamed *Account Adjustments*.
  - In C003, *Adjust Account* becomes *Internal Account Correction*, linked to a document re-verification step (*Re-verification of Documents*).

These names capture the nuanced meanings and roles of activities, providing clarity in the process flow, and ensuring each activity is contextually distinct and well-defined.
