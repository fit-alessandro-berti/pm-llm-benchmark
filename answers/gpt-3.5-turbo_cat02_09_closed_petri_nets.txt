Opposite Concept:
- Sink Place: A sink place in a Petri net is a place where tokens are consumed and do not leave the place. It represents a termination point for tokens in the system.

More general concept:
- Transition: A transition in a Petri net represents a state change in the system where tokens move from input places to output places. Transitions can be categorized as immediate or live based on their firing rules and behavior.

Explanation:
- Source Place: A source place in a Petri net is a place where tokens are produced and added to the system. It represents the starting point for tokens in the system to enter and flow through the Petri net.
- Immediate Transition: An immediate transition in a Petri net can fire as soon as its input places have the necessary tokens, without any delay. It represents a state change that occurs instantly.
- Live Transition: A live transition in a Petri net is one that can fire if all its input places have tokens, and at least one output place has enough capacity to accommodate all the tokens produced by the transition. It ensures that the system remains in a valid state after firing.
- Bounded Net: A bounded net in Petri nets is one in which the number of tokens in each place and the maximum number of tokens that can be produced or consumed by each transition is limited. This constraint helps in analyzing the behavior and properties of the system.
- Free Choice Net: A free choice net in Petri nets is one in which any enabled transition can fire independently of other transitions. This property allows for greater concurrency and flexibility in the system's behavior.
