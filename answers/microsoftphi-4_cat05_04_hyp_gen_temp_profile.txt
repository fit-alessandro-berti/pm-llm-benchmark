### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive to Approve (R to P):**
   - **Anomaly:** The average time between "Receive" (R) and "Approve" (P) is around 25 hours with a very low standard deviation. 
   - **Issue:** This suggests a highly consistent yet unexpectedly rapid approval process.
   
2. **Approve to Notify (P to N):**
   - **Anomaly:** An average of 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days for the time between "Approve" (P) and "Notify" (N).
   - **Issue:** The significant variability suggests sporadic delays in notification after approval.

3. **Assign to Close (A to C):**
   - **Anomaly:** Claims are closed in an average of 2 hours after being assigned.
   - **Issue:** This could indicate that claims are being closed without going through necessary intermediate steps like evaluation.

4. **Evaluate to Notify (E to N):**
   - **Anomaly:** Only 5 minutes on average between "Evaluate" (E) and "Notify" (N).
   - **Issue:** This may suggest a lack of thorough evaluation or omitted steps.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R to P:**
   - **Hypothesis:** The rigid scheduling might be due to automated pre-approval checks that bypass normal procedures, or an internal mandate to speed up certain types of claims.
   
2. **P to N:**
   - **Hypothesis:** There may be resource constraints or backlogs causing varied delays, or certain conditions inadvertently pushing claims to the bottom of the queue.

3. **A to C:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Claims might be improperly classified upon assignment, or there could be a system flaw allowing direct closure without criterion evaluation.

4. **E to N:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Possible automation in notification processes leading to inadvertent bypassing of necessary approvals, or data entry errors that rush the evaluation process.

### Proposed Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **R to P Anomaly Verification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, 
          LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp AS time_to_approval
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'R'
   ```
   - **Objective:** Identify claims where time to approval is either much less than 25 hours or very consistent across claims.

2. **P to N Anomaly Verification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, 
          LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp AS time_to_notify
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'P'
   ```
   - **Objective:** Detect claims with notification times significantly deviating from the 7-day average, identifying any patterns or outliers.

3. **A to C Anomaly Verification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, 
          LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp AS time_to_close
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'A'
   ```
   - **Objective:** Spot claims closed within an unusually short period post-assignment, possibly without evaluation.

4. **E to N Anomaly Verification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, 
          LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp AS time_to_notify_post_eval
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'E'
   ```
   - **Objective:** Find cases where evaluation and notification occur almost instantaneously, checking for missing or skipped steps.

These queries allow analyzing individual claim records to better understand the causes of these anomalies, potentially identifying systemic issues or areas for process improvement.
