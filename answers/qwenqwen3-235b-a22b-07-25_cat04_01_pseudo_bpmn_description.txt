The pseudo-BPMN representation describes a **customer request handling process** in a business environment—likely a sales, order fulfillment, or service provisioning system—where requests are categorized as either **standard** or **custom**, and processed accordingly. Below is a **detailed analysis** of the process, including the purpose of each step, the role of gateways, path convergence, and conditions under which approvals or rework loops are triggered.

---

### **1. Overall Process Objective**

The business process aims to:
- Receive and evaluate a customer request.
- Validate or analyze the request based on its type.
- Perform necessary checks (credit, inventory) or feasibility studies.
- Generate a quotation or rejection.
- Obtain approval if required.
- Finalize the order with an invoice.
- Send confirmation to the customer.

The process emphasizes **decision logic**, **parallel processing**, and **conditional rework**, reflecting a structured and scalable approach to handling diverse customer demands.

---

### **2. Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **Start Event**
- **Purpose**: Triggers the process when a customer submits a request (e.g., product order, service inquiry).
- **Input**: Customer request form, specification, or digital submission.

---

#### **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose**: Formal acknowledgment and intake of the request into the system.
- **Action**: Capture request details, assign a unique ID, and classify the request type (standard/custom).
- **Output**: Structured data for downstream processing.

---

#### **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**
- **Type**: **Exclusive (XOR) Gateway** – only one path is taken based on a condition.
- **Condition**: "Is the request type Standard or Custom?"
- **Paths**:
  - **Standard Request**: Routine, predefined product/service with known specs.
  - **Custom Request**: Requires tailored design, engineering, or configuration.

> This split ensures **path-specific handling** based on complexity and resource needs.

---

### **Path 1: Standard Request**

#### **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
- **Purpose**: Verify that the request conforms to standard product rules (e.g., supported configurations, valid options).
- **Action**: Check against catalog, pricing rules, compliance.

#### **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
- **Type**: **Parallel (AND) Gateway** – splits the flow into multiple concurrent paths.
- **Purpose**: Execute **independent checks simultaneously** to save time.
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - **Task C1: Credit Check** – Assess customer’s creditworthiness (e.g., payment history, credit limit).
  - **Task C2: Inventory Check** – Confirm product availability in stock or production pipeline.

> **Note**: These tasks run in parallel because they do not depend on each other.

#### **Join (All Parallel Checks Completed)**
- **Purpose**: Synchronize the flow after both parallel tasks are completed.
- **Behavior**: The process waits for **both** checks to finish before proceeding.
- **Outcome**: Enables delivery date calculation only when both credit and inventory are confirmed.

#### **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
- **Purpose**: Estimate when the product can be delivered based on inventory status and logistics.
- **Input**: Results from credit and inventory checks.
- **Output**: Delivery timeline for inclusion in the invoice.

---

### **Path 2: Custom Request**

#### **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
- **Purpose**: Assess technical, engineering, or production feasibility of the custom request.
- **Action**: Involve design/engineering teams, cost modeling, timeline estimation.

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
- **Decision**: Based on technical or economic constraints.
- **Paths**:
  - **Yes**: Proceed to quotation.
  - **No**: Request cannot be fulfilled.

#### **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
- **Purpose**: Inform the customer that the request cannot be fulfilled.
- **Action**: Automated or manual communication with explanation.
- **Flow**: Leads directly to **End Event** – process terminates here for infeasible custom requests.

#### **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
- **Purpose**: Generate a tailored price and timeline proposal.
- **Content**: Includes cost breakdown, delivery estimate, terms.
- **Trigger**: Feasibility confirmed.

---

### **Convergence Point: After Standard or Custom Path Tasks**

> At this stage, both the **Standard** (after Task D) and **Custom** (after Task E1) paths converge.

- **Standard Path**: Task D  Next
- **Custom Path**: Task B2  Feasible? Yes  Task E1  Next

> **Note**: The **Custom Rejection Path (E2)** does **not** converge here—it ends early.

---

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
- **Decision Point**: Based on business rules (e.g., order value, risk level, customer status).
- **Factors**:
  - **Standard Path**: High-value orders, credit risk, new customers.
  - **Custom Path**: All custom quotes may require approval by default.
- **Paths**:
  - **Yes**: Proceed to manager approval.
  - **No**: Skip approval and generate invoice directly.

---

### **Approval Sub-Process (If Approval Needed)**

#### **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
- **Purpose**: Add oversight for higher-risk or higher-value decisions.
- **Action**: Manager reviews validation/feasibility results and quotation.

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
- **Decision**: Manager accepts or rejects the proposal.
- **Paths**:
  - **Yes**  Task G: Generate Final Invoice
  - **No**  Task H: Re-evaluate Conditions

#### **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
- **Purpose**: Address the reasons for rejection (e.g., too costly, low margin, risk).
- **Action**: Revise terms, explore alternatives, or adjust scope.

> **Critical Rework Loop**:
- **For Custom Requests**: Loop **back to Task E1** (Prepare Custom Quotation) – revise and re-submit.
- **For Standard Requests**: Loop **back to Task D** (Calculate Delivery Date) – possibly adjust delivery or inventory sourcing.

> This loop allows iterative refinement until approval is obtained or the request is abandoned.

> **Note**: The process does **not** loop back to the beginning—only to the last major decision point in each path, ensuring efficiency.

---

### **Post-Approval or Direct Invoice Path**

#### **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
- **Purpose**: Create the official billing document.
- **Trigger**:
  - Directly after approval.
  - Or if no approval was needed, after convergence.
- **Content**: Final pricing, delivery date, terms, taxes.

---

#### **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- **Purpose**: Notify the customer that the request is accepted and processed.
- **Content**: Invoice copy, delivery timeline, next steps.
- **Channel**: Email, portal, or physical mail.

---

#### **End Event**
- **Purpose**: Terminate the process successfully.
- **Reached by**:
  - All approved and invoiced requests (via Task I).
  - Rejected custom requests (via Task E2).

---

### **3. Key Process Characteristics**

#### **Decision Logic**
- **XOR Gateways**: Used for **mutually exclusive choices**:
  - Request type (Standard vs. Custom).
  - Feasibility (Yes/No).
  - Approval granted (Yes/No).
- **AND Gateway**: Enables **parallel execution** of independent checks (credit + inventory), improving efficiency.

#### **Path Convergence**
- The **Standard** and **Custom** paths converge **after** their respective core processing (D and E1), before the approval decision.
- This allows **uniform handling** of invoicing and confirmation, regardless of request type.

#### **Rework Mechanism**
- **Approval denial** triggers a **targeted rework loop**:
  - **Custom**: Back to quotation (E1) – revise offer.
  - **Standard**: Back to delivery date (D) – adjust fulfillment plan.
- **No full restart** – maintains process efficiency.

### **4. Differences Based on Request Type**

| Aspect | **Standard Request** | **Custom Request** |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Validation** | Standard rules check | Feasibility analysis (technical/economic) |
| **Parallel Checks** | Credit + Inventory | Not applicable (handled later if needed) |
| **Quotation** | Based on catalog pricing | Custom pricing and terms |
| **Rejection Point** | After validation or checks | After feasibility analysis |
| **Rework Loop Target** | Task D (Delivery Date) | Task E1 (Quotation) |
| **Approval Likelihood** | Conditional (value/risk-based) | Likely required (higher uncertainty) |

---

### **5. Conditions for Approval & Rework**

#### **Approval Needed When**:
- Order exceeds a monetary threshold.
- Customer has poor credit history.
- Request involves high customization or risk.
- Internal policy mandates review for non-standard items.

#### **Re-evaluation Triggered When**:
- Manager **denies approval** due to:
  - Unacceptable risk.
  - Insufficient margin.
  - Resource constraints.
- Team must **revise and re-submit** the proposal.

### **6. Summary of Flow Variants**

1. **Standard Request – No Approval Needed**:
   > A  B1  C1 & C2 (in parallel)  D  G  I  End

2. **Standard Request – Approval Needed & Granted**:
   > A  B1  C1 & C2  D  F  (Approved)  G  I  End

3. **Standard Request – Approval Denied**:
   > ...  D  F  (Denied)  H  **Loop to D**  (revise delivery)  F  (Approved)  G  I  End

4. **Custom Request – Feasible, No Approval**:
   > A  B2  (Feasible)  E1  G  I  End

5. **Custom Request – Feasible, Approval Denied**:
   > ...  E1  F  (Denied)  H  **Loop to E1**  (revise quote)  F  G  I  End

6. **Custom Request – Not Feasible**:
   > A  B2  (Not Feasible)  E2  End

### **Conclusion**

This process is **robust, decision-driven, and adaptable**, supporting both routine and complex customer demands. It uses **XOR gateways** for conditional routing, **AND gateways** for efficiency, and **targeted rework loops** to handle approval rejections without restarting. The design ensures **scalability**, **risk control**, and **customer communication** at key stages, making it suitable for sales, manufacturing, or service industries handling mixed-order portfolios.
