 To address potential bias in the loan application review process, we will add several DECLARE constraints to the given model. These constraints will ensure that decisions are not directly influenced by sensitive attributes and that additional checks are in place for fairness. Here is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with the newly introduced constraints:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Ensures bias mitigation checks exist
    },
    "absence": {
        "DirectBias": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Ensures no direct biased actions
    },
    "exactly_one": {
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Ensures only one final decision per application
    },
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Requires a bias check if race is checked
    },
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Manual review must coexist with approving a minority applicant
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Manual review must coexist with rejecting a minority applicant
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Response to checking race should be a bias check
    },
    "precedence": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # A bias mitigation check should precede final decisions
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Bias mitigation should be followed by approval
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Bias mitigation should be followed by rejection
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Checking race should not coexist with final decisions without a check in between
    },
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Checking race should not be directly succeeded by approval
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Checking race should not be directly succeeded by rejection
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

**Rationale for Added Constraints:**

1. **Existence of BiasMitigationCheck:** By ensuring that a `BiasMitigationCheck` exists in the process, we can be more confident that decisions are not made solely based on sensitive attributes.

2. **Absence of DirectBias:** The `absence` constraint ensures that there is no activity named `DirectBias`, which represents a direct biased action. This enforces that decisions are not directly linked to sensitive attributes.

3. **Coexistence with ManualReview:** For decisions involving minority applicants, a `ManualReview` activity must be present. This ensures that decisions for sensitive demographics are scrutinized more carefully.

4. **Response and Succession Constraints:** By requiring a `BiasMitigationCheck` to follow activities that check sensitive attributes (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`), we prevent immediate biased decisions. The `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede any final decision, ensuring a fair evaluation.

5. **Non-succession Constraints:** We prevent direct succession from a sensitive attribute event (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to a decision event (`Approve` or `Reject`) without an intervening `BiasMitigationCheck`, thus avoiding immediate biased outcomes.

6. **Precedence of BiasMitigationCheck:** A `BiasMitigationCheck` should always precede a final decision to ensure that any potential bias has been addressed before a decision is made.

These constraints collectively aim to reduce bias in the loan application process by enforcing additional checks, preventing direct succession of sensitive attribute checks with decision steps, and ensuring that each decision is well-considered and fair.
