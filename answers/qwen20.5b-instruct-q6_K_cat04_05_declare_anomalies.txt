Based on the constraints provided, I would like to highlight a couple of anomalies that could be observed:

1. **Co-Existence**: It seems the "Co-Existence" constraint is not clearly defined or used consistently across all cases. Co-existence means that both the response and its predecessor are satisfied, but without specifying what follows them in time. This ambiguity can lead to incorrect outcomes based on different interpretations of "follows".

2. **Precedence**: In some constraints, precedence seems to be weaker than others. It's not clear whether it applies when A occurs before B (indicating the existence constraint) or vice versa (indicating the pre-existence constraint). This could lead to incorrect outcomes for certain combinations where one event follows another.

3. **Sufficiency**: The "Succession" and "Chain succession" constraints are stronger than those of "Precedence" and "Co-Existence". For example, Succession applies to any number of events, but does not specify that the event precedes its predecessor; Chain succession is satisfied by only a limited set of possible events.

4. **Inception**: In some cases, there seems to be an intransitivity between "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled". It could mean that Request Payment follows Payment Handled (in which case the next occurrence would also satisfy the absence condition), but it may not necessarily imply payment or handling.

5. **Missing Dependencies**: Some of the missing dependencies seem to depend on either the request or the completion, rather than a strict chain between them. This can lead to incorrect outcomes where one dependency depends on another.

These anomalies could be addressed by refining these constraints and possibly adding additional conditions or ensuring that specific events (and their order) are always followed in time and space.
