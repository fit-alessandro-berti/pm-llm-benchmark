Okay, here is a Python dictionary representing an estimated temporal profile for the described global supply chain process. The times are in seconds.

I've made estimations based on the nature of each activity in a complex, global, high-tech electronics manufacturing context.

*   **Short Durations (hours to a day):** Internal handoffs, quick inspections, packaging.
*   **Medium Durations (days to weeks):** Component assembly, product testing, supplier selection, internal logistics, warehouse storage before specific orders.
*   **Long Durations (weeks to months):** Order placement to component receipt (supplier lead times, international shipping), distribution to customers, and especially the time from an early process step to eventual after-sales support.

Standard deviations are estimated as a fraction of the average, generally larger for processes with more external dependencies or inherent variability (e.g., supplier lead times, customer behavior for after-sales).

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly or closely connected activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (432000, 129600),       # Avg: 5 days (negotiation, finalization), STDEV: 1.5 days
    ('OP', 'RC'): (5443200, 1814400),     # Avg: 9 weeks (supplier lead time, shipping), STDEV: 3 weeks
    ('RC', 'QI'): (21600, 7200),          # Avg: 6 hours (unloading, initial check-in to inspection start), STDEV: 2 hours
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 86400),        # Avg: 2 days (thorough inspection, kitting for assembly), STDEV: 1 day
    ('CA', 'PT'): (604800, 172800),       # Avg: 7 days (complex assembly), STDEV: 2 days
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 28800),         # Avg: 1 day (testing and result logging), STDEV: 8 hours
    ('PK', 'WS'): (14400, 3600),          # Avg: 4 hours (packaging to warehouse slotting), STDEV: 1 hour
    ('WS', 'DT'): (1209600, 604800),      # Avg: 2 weeks (average time in warehouse before order fulfillment), STDEV: 1 week
    ('DT', 'AS'): (7776000, 2592000),     # Avg: ~3 months (delivery + usage time until first support incident), STDEV: ~1 month

    # Pairs with intermediate steps (eventually following)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (5875200, 1850000),     # SS -> OP -> RC (sum of SS-OP and OP-RC, slightly higher combined STDEV)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (6220800, 1900000),     # OP -> RC -> QI -> CA
    ('RC', 'PT'): (864000, 200000),       # RC -> QI -> CA -> PT (internal factory flow)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (864000, 190000),       # QI -> CA -> PT -> PK
    ('CA', 'WS'): (705600, 180000),       # CA -> PT -> PK -> WS
    ('PT', 'DT'): (1310400, 610000),      # PT -> PK -> WS -> DT
    ('SS', 'CA'): (6480000, 2000000),     # From initial supplier selection to component assembly starting
    ('OP', 'PT'): (6825600, 2000000),     # From order placement to product testing starting
    ('RC', 'DT'): (2088000, 650000),      # From receiving components to distribution start
    ('SS', 'DT'): (7689600, 2200000),     # From supplier selection to distribution
    ('SS', 'AS'): (15465600, 3500000)     # From supplier selection to potential after-sales support (long lifecycle view)
}

# Example of how to access an item:
# print(f"Average time between Supplier Selection (SS) and Receive Components (RC): {temporal_profile[('SS', 'RC')][0]} seconds")
