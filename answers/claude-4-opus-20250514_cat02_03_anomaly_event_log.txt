I'll analyze each case in the event log to identify anomalies based on standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process practices.

## Analysis of Anomalies:

### Case 1001: **Normal Process**
This case follows the standard P2P sequence:
1. Create Purchase Requisition  Approve  Issue PO  Receive Goods  Invoice Received  Match Invoice  Release Payment  Close Case

This represents a compliant process flow with proper controls.

### Case 1002: **Multiple Critical Anomalies**
**Issues identified:**
1. **Missing Approval Before PO** (Critical): Purchase Order issued immediately after requisition creation without approval
2. **Payment Before Goods Receipt** (Critical): Payment released before goods were received
3. **Late Approval**: Approval occurred after payment was already made
4. **Invoice Before Goods**: Invoice received and paid before goods arrival

**Why problematic:** This violates fundamental controls - paying without receiving goods exposes the organization to fraud, non-delivery risk, and circumvents approval authority limits.

### Case 1003: **Severe Process Violations**
**Issues identified:**
1. **Payment Before Invoice** (Critical): Payment released 1 day before invoice was even received
2. **Payment Before Goods Receipt**: Payment made 2 days before goods arrived
3. **Completely Reversed Sequence**: The normal sequence of GoodsInvoicePayment is completely inverted

**Why problematic:** This suggests potential fraud or severe control breakdown. Paying before receiving an invoice or goods violates basic financial controls and audit requirements.

### Case 1004: **Procurement Control Failure**
**Issues identified:**
1. **Goods Received Before PO**: Goods received before Purchase Order was issued
2. **Retroactive PO Creation**: PO created after goods were already received

**Why problematic:** This indicates "maverick buying" where someone circumvented procurement procedures. This can lead to:
- Unauthorized commitments
- Budget overruns
- Compliance violations
- Weakened negotiating position with vendors

## Summary of Key Anomalies:

1. **Payment without goods receipt** (Cases 1002, 1003) - High fraud risk
2. **Payment before invoice** (Case 1003) - Violates basic accounting controls
3. **Missing or late approvals** (Case 1002) - Bypasses authorization controls
4. **Goods receipt before PO** (Case 1004) - Indicates maverick spending

These anomalies suggest serious control weaknesses that could expose the organization to financial loss, fraud, and compliance violations. Immediate investigation and process remediation would be recommended.
