The pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a process for handling customer requests, distinguishing between standard and custom request types. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Process Overview
The process begins with receiving a customer request and involves various checks and validations that differ based on the nature of the request (standard or custom). The process includes decision points, called gateways, that determine the next steps based on specific conditions. It ends with sending a confirmation back to the customer.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Start Event**: The trigger that initiates the process.

2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**: The customer request is received, marking the official start of the processing.

3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**:
   - This exclusive decision point checks whether the request is standard or custom.
   - **Standard Request Path**:
     1. **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**: Standard validation steps are conducted.
     2. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**: An AND gateway enables concurrent execution of multiple tasks.
       - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**: The customer's creditworthiness is assessed.
       - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**: The availability of requested items in inventory is verified.
     3. After both parallel checks are completed, the tasks converge back:
       - **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**: Based on validation and checks, the delivery date is calculated.
   - **Custom Request Path**:
     1. **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**: A detailed analysis to determine if the custom request is feasible.
     2. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**: This decision point checks the feasibility of customization.
       - **If Yes**: 
         - **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**: A quotation specific to the custom request is prepared.
       - **If No**:
         - **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**: A rejection notice is sent to the customer, and the process terminates here for this path (end event).

4. **Post Validation/Quotation Tasks**:
   - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**: This decision point checks if managerial approval is required for proceeding.
     - **If Yes**:
       - **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**: Request for necessary managerial approval.
       - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**: This checks if the approval was granted.
         - **If Yes**: 
           - **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**: An invoice is generated.
         - **If No**:
           - **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**: Conditions are re-evaluated based on feedback.
             - **Custom Path**: Loops back to **Task E1 ("Prepare Custom Quotation")**.
             - **Standard Path**: Loops back to **Task D ("Calculate Delivery Date")**.
     - **If No Approval Needed**: Directly proceed to **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**.

5. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**: Final step involves sending an order confirmation to the customer.

6. **End Event**: Marks the conclusion of the process.

### Detailed Explanation of Components

- **Gateways**: 
  - **XOR (Exclusive)** gateways are decision points where only one path is taken based on a condition.
  - **AND gateways** are used to branch the flow into parallel tasks that can be executed concurrently.

- **Task Differentiation**:
  - For a **Standard Request**: 
    - Involves standard validation, parallel checks (credit and inventory), and delivery date calculation.
  - For a **Custom Request**: 
    - Involves feasibility analysis, which may lead to either a custom quotation or a rejection notice.

- **Approvals and Rework**:
  - Approval is conditionally required based on the type of request or other criteria.
  - If approval is requested and denied, the relevant steps differ between standard (re-evaluate delivery conditions) and custom (re-evaluate and potentially modify quotation).

### Convergence and Loops
- Parallel tasks in the standard path converge before calculating the delivery date.
- If rework is needed due to denial of approval, paths loop back to specific tasks (either delivery calculation for standard or quotation preparation for custom), ensuring that all necessary conditions are reassessed.

This detailed representation ensures that every possible outcome of customer requests is managed effectively, accommodating both standard and custom demands while also incorporating necessary checks, validations, and approvals.
