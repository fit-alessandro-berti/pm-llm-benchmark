Here’s a stepbystep explanation of the business process behind your pseudoBPMN, including what each task does, how gateways work, where paths diverge/converge, and how standard vs. custom requests behave.

---

## 1. Overall Business Context

The process describes how a company handles incoming customer requests for products or services. It distinguishes between:

- **Standard requests**: Pre-defined, typical offers (e.g., catalog items).
- **Custom requests**: Tailored offers that may require special production, configuration, or conditions.

The process ensures:
- The request is valid and feasible.
- Necessary checks (credit, inventory, feasibility) are performed.
- Approvals are obtained when needed.
- The customer receives a final confirmation (quotation/order/invoice).

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Description

### 2.1 Start Event  Task A: "Receive Customer Request"

- **Purpose**: This is where the process begins when a customer sends a request (order, quote request, customization inquiry, etc.).
- **What happens**:
  - Capture basic request details (customer data, requested product/service, quantity, delivery preferences).
  - Create a case/record in the system to track the process.

---

### 2.2 XOR Gateway: "Check Request Type"

- **Gateway type**: XOR (exclusive OR)
  - Only one outgoing path is taken.
- **Business meaning**: The system or an employee determines whether the request is:
  - A **Standard** request, or
  - A **Custom** request that requires tailored work.

**Outgoing paths:**
1. **If Type = Standard  Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
2. **If Type = Custom  Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**

---

## 3. Standard Request Path

### 3.1 Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"

- **Purpose**: Ensure that a standard request is complete and valid.
- **Typical activities**:
  - Check that requested items/services exist in the catalog.
  - Validate pricing rules.
  - Confirm that customer data (billing, shipping, tax info) is complete.
  - Validate requested delivery date format, address, etc.
- **Outcome**: The request is either validated successfully or flagged internally for correction (in your pseudo-BPMN, we assume it passes to the next step).

---

### 3.2 AND Gateway: "Run Parallel Checks"

- **Gateway type**: AND-split (parallel)
  - Both outgoing paths are executed in parallel.
- **Business meaning**: Once the request is valid, two independent checks start at the same time:
  1. **Credit Check (Task C1)**
  2. **Inventory Check (Task C2)**

#### Task C1: "Credit Check"

- **Purpose**: Assess the customer’s ability to pay.
- **Typical activities**:
  - Check credit limit and current exposure.
  - Look up payment history, overdue invoices.
  - Flag potential credit risk.
- **Outcome**: Credit status (e.g., OK, needs approval, or declined).

#### Task C2: "Inventory Check"

- **Purpose**: Verify that the requested items are available in the requested quantity and timeframe.
- **Typical activities**:
  - Check stock levels in warehouse(s).
  - Check planned replenishments or production.
- **Outcome**: Availability status (e.g., available, partial, or not available).

---

### 3.3 Parallel Join (AND-join)  Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"

- **Gateway type**: AND-join
  - Waits for all incoming parallel branches (C1 and C2) to finish.
- **Business meaning**: The process must have both credit and inventory information before proceeding.

#### Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"

- **Purpose**: Determine a realistic delivery date for the standard request.
- **Typical activities**:
  - Combine:
    - Inventory availability (from C2),
    - Production or supplier lead times (if needed),
    - Logistics transit times.
  - Possibly consider customer priorities or service levels.
- **Outcome**: A planned delivery date that will be reflected in the quotation/invoice sent to the customer.

---

## 4. Custom Request Path

### 4.1 Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"

- **Purpose**: Assess whether the requested customization can be provided at all and under what conditions.
- **Typical activities**:
  - Evaluate technical feasibility (can we build/configure this?).
  - Check capacity (engineering, production, implementation resources).
  - Consider regulatory, compliance, or safety constraints.
  - Rough cost and lead-time estimation.
- **Outcome**: A conclusion on feasibility (feasible vs. not feasible) along with conditions (cost, timeline, constraints).

---

### 4.2 XOR Gateway: "Is Customization Feasible?"

- **Gateway type**: XOR (exclusive OR)
- **Business meaning**: Decide which outcome path to take based on feasibility analysis.

**Outgoing paths:**

1. **If Yes  Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
   - The customization is possible.
2. **If No  Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"  End Event**
   - The customization is not possible.

#### Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"

- **Purpose**: Create a detailed offer for the custom request.
- **Typical activities**:
  - Define scope and specification of the customization.
  - Calculate custom pricing, margins, discounts.
  - Estimate delivery date/implementation timeline.
  - Specify special terms (e.g., non-cancellable, milestone payments).
- **Outcome**: A draft/custom quotation ready for approval and/or customer communication.

#### Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"

- **Purpose**: Inform the customer that the requested customization cannot be provided.
- **Typical activities**:
  - Explain reasons for rejection, where appropriate.
  - Optionally propose alternatives (e.g., similar standard product).
- **Outcome**: Process ends for this request (End Event).

---

## 5. Convergence of Standard and Custom Paths

After:
- The **Standard path** completes Task D (delivery date calculated), or
- The **Custom path** completes Task E1 (custom quotation prepared),

the process flows into a common decision point:

### XOR Gateway: "Is Approval Needed?"

- **Gateway type**: XOR
- **Business meaning**: Decide whether this specific case requires managerial approval before finalizing the invoice/offer.

**Typical conditions for approval:**
- Custom deal or non-standard terms.
- High order value exceeding a threshold.
- Customer with poor or borderline credit.
- Margins below a minimum level.

**Outgoing paths:**

1. **If Yes  Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
2. **If No  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**

---

## 6. Approval and Rework Loop

### 6.1 Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"

- **Purpose**: Get a manager or authorized person to approve or reject the proposed deal.
- **Typical activities**:
  - Manager reviews pricing, margins, risks.
  - Manager reviews credit and feasibility information.
  - Manager confirms or rejects the proposed conditions (price, scope, delivery date).

---

### 6.2 XOR Gateway: "Is Approval Granted?"

- **Gateway type**: XOR
- **Business meaning**: Decide what to do based on the manager’s decision.

**Outgoing paths:**

1. **If Yes  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
2. **If No  Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**

---

### 6.3 Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions" (Rework)

- **Purpose**: Modify the offer or conditions so that it might be acceptable on a second review.
- **Behavior differs by request type**:
  - **For Custom requests**:
    - Loop back to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**.
    - Rework could involve:
      - Adjusting scope/specification.
      - Increasing price or changing payment terms.
      - Extending delivery time.
  - **For Standard requests**:
    - Loop back to **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**.
    - Rework could involve:
      - Adjusting delivery date.
      - Changing fulfillment location or split deliveries.
      - Possibly incorporating different inventory or shipping options (depending on business rules).

**Loop behavior**:
- This creates a **rework loop**: after adjusting conditions, the process may go again through the “Approval Needed?” gateway, and possibly through approval (F) again, until a configuration is acceptable and gets approved.

---

## 7. Finalization and Customer Communication

### 7.1 Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"

- **Purpose**: Formalize the outcome of the process into a final commercial document (invoice, order confirmation, or formal quotation).
- **Typical activities**:
  - Populate all agreed terms: items, quantities, prices, discounts.
  - Include delivery dates, payment terms, and conditions.
  - Generate document in the system (PDF, EDI, etc.).

---

### 7.2 Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"

- **Purpose**: Communicate the final decision and conditions to the customer.
- **Typical activities**:
  - Send the invoice/quotation/contract via email, portal, or EDI.
  - Provide any additional instructions (e.g., payment details, next steps).
- **Outcome**: Customer is officially informed; the process then reaches the **End Event**.

---

## 8. Summary of Key Differences and Conditions

### 8.1 Standard vs. Custom Requests

- **Standard Request**:
  - Validation is straightforward (Task B1).
  - Parallel operational checks: credit and inventory (C1 & C2).
  - Delivery date is calculated algorithmically based on standard rules (D).
  - Typically approval may be required only for unusually large or high-risk orders.

- **Custom Request**:
  - Focus on feasibility and custom design (Task B2).
  - Decision on feasibility (XOR gateway).
  - If feasible, a custom quotation is prepared (E1).
  - If not feasible, the process ends with a rejection notice (E2).
  - More likely to require approval due to non-standard nature and higher risks.

### 8.2 When Approval is Needed

- Driven by business rules at the “Is Approval Needed?” gateway:
  - Custom offer?  Often “Yes”.
  - Order value over threshold?  “Yes”.
  - Margins too low?  “Yes”.
  - Customer risk profile problematic?  “Yes”.
- Otherwise, the process can skip approval and go directly to invoice generation.

### 8.3 When Rework (Loop) is Triggered

- If the manager does **not** grant approval at “Is Approval Granted?”:
  - Standard request: Rework delivery/conditions via Task D.
  - Custom request: Rework custom quotation via Task E1.
- Loop may repeat until:
  - Conditions are acceptable and get approved, or
  - The company decides to cancel the process (not modeled, but possible in practice).
