Below is a step-by-step explanation of the business process described by your pseudo-BPMN, including the purpose of each task, the role of the gateways, how paths differ for standard vs. custom requests, and when approvals and rework are triggered.

---

## 1. Overall Business Context

The process describes how a company handles customer requests for products or services, which can be either:

- **Standard** (predefined offerings, usually routine), or  
- **Custom** (tailored solutions requiring feasibility analysis).

The process covers:
- Initial receipt and classification of the request,
- Validation and checks (credit, inventory, feasibility),
- Potential approval steps,
- Final pricing/invoicing,
- Customer communication.

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Description

### 2.1 Start Event  Task A: "Receive Customer Request"

**Purpose:**  
This is the entry point. A customer sends a request (e.g., via email, web form, phone, sales rep). The process starts when the request is formally received and recorded.

**Outcome:**  
You now have a defined “case” with basic details (customer, requested product/service, quantity, deadlines, etc.) and can proceed to categorize it.

---

### 2.2 XOR Gateway: "Check Request Type"

This is an **exclusive gateway (XOR)**, meaning the process follows exactly **one** outgoing path based on a decision.

**Decision:** Is the request:
- **Standard**  follow the **Standard path**, or  
- **Custom**  follow the **Custom path**.

This decision is typically based on:
- Whether the requested product/service is part of the standard catalog,
- Whether the required configuration falls within predefined limits (e.g., standard options vs. special engineering).

---

## 3. Standard Request Path

### 3.1 Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"

**Purpose:**  
For standard requests, perform routine checks, such as:
- Confirm requested product/service is indeed in the standard catalog,
- Validate customer data (e.g., account status, billing info),
- Check basic constraints (minimum order quantity, standard pricing rules, etc.).

**Outcome:**  
The request is confirmed as valid and can proceed to more detailed operational checks.

---

### 3.2 AND Gateway: "Run Parallel Checks"

This is a **parallel gateway (AND)** that **splits** the flow into multiple activities that can occur simultaneously.

**Meaning:**  
Two checks are carried out in parallel:
- **Task C1: Credit Check**
- **Task C2: Inventory Check**

Both must be completed before proceeding.

---

### 3.3 Task C1: "Credit Check"

**Purpose:**  
Assess the customer’s financial reliability:
- Check credit limit,
- Check outstanding invoices,
- Apply internal credit rules.

**Outcome:**  
Result might be:
- Within acceptable credit terms,
- Requires special payment conditions,
- Or potentially not acceptable (may impact later steps, e.g., approval needed).

---

### 3.4 Task C2: "Inventory Check"

**Purpose:**  
Verify if enough stock or capacity is available to fulfill the order:
- Check warehouse stock levels,
- Analyze production capacity or lead times,
- Identify any supply constraints.

**Outcome:**  
You know whether you can supply the requested quantity and by when.

---

### 3.5 Parallel Join: "All Parallel Checks Completed"

This is the **AND-join** counterpart of the parallel gateway:

**Meaning:**  
The process waits until **both**:
- Credit Check (C1), and  
- Inventory Check (C2)  

are completed. Only then does the flow continue.

---

### 3.6 Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"

**Purpose:**  
Based on credit and inventory results, determine:
- When the order can be shipped or delivered,
- Any constraints that affect scheduling.

Inputs include:
- Inventory availability and replenishment times,
- Production capacity,
- Internal lead times.

**Outcome:**  
A realistic delivery date (or date range) is calculated for the standard request.

---

## 4. Custom Request Path

### 4.1 Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"

**Purpose:**  
For custom requests, evaluate whether the requested customization is technically and commercially feasible. This typically involves:
- Technical feasibility: Can the product/service be modified as requested?
- Cost and time: Can it be delivered within acceptable cost and schedule?
- Resource availability: Engineering, production, materials.

**Outcome:**  
Documented feasibility result: feasible as requested, feasible with changes, or not feasible.

---

### 4.2 XOR Gateway: "Is Customization Feasible?"

**Meaning:**  
This is an exclusive gateway evaluating the outcome of the feasibility analysis.

- **If Yes (feasible)**  proceed to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**.
- **If No (not feasible)**  proceed to **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**.

Only **one** of these paths is taken.

---

### 4.3 Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"

**Purpose:**  
For feasible custom requests, prepare a detailed quotation:
- Custom technical solution description,
- Pricing (often cost-plus or value-based),
- Delivery timelines and conditions,
- Special terms and conditions.

**Outcome:**  
A custom quotation ready for internal approval (if required) and then for sending to the customer.

---

### 4.4 Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"  End Event

**Purpose:**  
If customization is not feasible:
- Inform the customer politely that the request cannot be fulfilled,
- Optionally suggest alternatives (e.g., standard product or lesser customization).

**Outcome:**  
Process ends for this request (End Event) because the order cannot proceed.

---

## 5. Convergence of Standard and Custom Paths

After either:
- Standard path reaches **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**, or  
- Custom path reaches **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**,  

both paths converge in the sense that they now feed into a common decision point about approval.

The pseudo-BPMN phrase:

> "After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed"

means:  
- From **Task D (Standard)**, or  
- From **Task E1 (Custom)**,  

the process flows into the next XOR gateway.

---

## 6. Approval Logic

### 6.1 XOR Gateway: "Is Approval Needed?"

**Meaning:**  
Another exclusive decision.

**Criteria for needing approval might include:**
- High order value or high discount,
- High risk (credit or technical risk),
- Unusual payment terms,
- Strategic customers or non-standard conditions.

- **If Yes**  go to **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**.
- **If No**  skip directly to **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**.

Only one branch is followed.

---

### 6.2 Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"

**Purpose:**  
A manager or designated authority reviews:
- Calculated delivery dates (for standard requests),
- Custom quotation (for custom requests),
- Financial conditions, risks, and margins,
- Contractual and compliance aspects.

They decide to:
- Approve, or  
- Reject / request changes.

---

### 6.3 XOR Gateway: "Is Approval Granted?"

**Meaning:**  
Checks the result of Task F.

- **If Yes**  proceed to **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**.
- **If No**  proceed to **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**.

---

## 7. Rework / Loopback

### 7.1 Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"

**Purpose:**  
When approval is **not** granted:
- Identify what needs to change for the request to be acceptable:
  - For a custom request: adjust technical scope, price, or terms.
  - For a standard request: adjust delivery date, quantity, or terms.
- Possibly communicate internally with sales, engineering, or finance to refine the proposal.

**Outcome:**  
A revised proposal needs to be re-prepared and then possibly re-approved.

---

### 7.2 Loop Back to E1 (Custom) or D (Standard)

The pseudo-BPMN states:

> Loop back to Task E1 (for Custom Path) or Task D (for Standard Path)

**Meaning:**
- If the request is **Custom**:
  - After re-evaluation, you go back to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"** to create a modified/custom quotation (for example, adjusted pricing, scope or terms).
  - Then you again pass through the “Is Approval Needed?” gateway, possibly requiring another approval cycle.

- If the request is **Standard**:
  - After re-evaluation, you go back to **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"** to adjust delivery dates, quantities, or other standard parameters.
  - Then again through the “Is Approval Needed?” gateway and possibly the approval step.

This loop continues until:
- Approval is granted, or  
- The process is terminated (e.g., customer withdraws request, or internally you decide not to proceed—though this termination is not explicitly shown in the pseudo-BPMN).

---

## 8. Finalization and Customer Communication

### 8.1 Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"

**Purpose:**  
Once:
- Approval is not required, or  
- Approval has been granted,  

the company generates the final commercial document, which may be:
- A formal order confirmation with pricing,
- A final invoice (if the process combines quotation and invoicing),
- A binding commercial offer.

**Outcome:**  
A final document is produced that clearly states the agreed price, conditions, and (for standard) delivery dates.

---

### 8.2 Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"  End Event

**Purpose:**  
Communicate the result to the customer:
- For standard orders: send order confirmation including delivery dates and prices.
- For custom orders: send the approved custom quote/invoice and conditions.

**Outcome:**  
Customer receives confirmation; the process ends (End Event). Subsequent operational processes (e.g., order fulfillment, delivery, billing collection) would start in their own workflows.

---

## 9. How Tasks Differ for Standard vs. Custom Requests

**Standard Requests (B1  C1/C2  D):**
- Focus on **routine operational checks**:
  - Standard validation (B1),
  - Parallel credit and inventory checks (C1, C2),
  - Delivery date calculation (D).
- The solution itself is predefined; you only validate feasibility within standard limits and schedule.

**Custom Requests (B2  feasibility  E1 or E2):**
- Focus on **technical and commercial feasibility**:
  - In-depth feasibility analysis (B2),
  - Decision if feasible (gateway),
  - Either prepare a **custom quotation** (E1) or send **rejection** (E2).
- Requires more cross-functional input (engineering, product development) and can fail at feasibility stage before pricing.

Downstream:
- Both standard and custom paths converge into the same approval logic and invoicing/confirmation steps, but:
  - **Standard**: approval is for the standard order conditions and delivery.
  - **Custom**: approval is for the custom proposal (scope, price, risk).

---

## 10. When Approvals and Rework Are Triggered

**Approval is triggered when:**
- The “Is Approval Needed?” XOR gateway evaluates to **Yes**, based on rules such as:
  - Order value above a threshold,
  - Significant discounts or non-standard payment terms,
  - High-risk customers or custom engineering.

**Rework is triggered when:**
- The “Is Approval Granted?” XOR gateway evaluates to **No**:
  - Manager or approver does not accept the conditions,
  - They may request changes to price, delivery, scope, risk mitigation, or contractual clauses.

**Rework path:**
- Perform re-evaluation (Task H),
- Then loop back to:
  - **Task D** for standard requests to recalculate delivery or conditions, or  
  - **Task E1** for custom requests to prepare a revised custom quotation.

This loop can repeat until an acceptable version is approved and the process moves to final invoicing and confirmation.

This covers the purpose of each step, the meaning of the gateways, how paths diverge, converge, and loop back, and how standard and custom requests are treated differently throughout the process.
