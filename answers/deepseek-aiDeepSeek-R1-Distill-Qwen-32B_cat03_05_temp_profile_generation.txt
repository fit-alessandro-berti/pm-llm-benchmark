Okay, so I need to create a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for a global supply chain process involving high-tech electronics manufacturing. The dictionary should map pairs of activities to their average time and standard deviation. The activities involved are Supplier Selection (SS), Order Placement (OP), Receive Components (RC), Quality Inspection (QI), Component Assembly (CA), Product Testing (PT), Packaging (PK), Warehouse Storage (WS), Distribution (DT), and After-Sales Support (AS).

First, I need to understand what a temporal profile is. From the prompt, it's a model that describes the average and standard deviation of the times between pairs of activities that eventually follow each other in process executions. So, for every possible pair of activities where one comes before another in a trace, I need to estimate these two values.

The example given in the prompt uses tuples like ('A', 'B') with values (average, stdev). So I'll structure my dictionary similarly.

Now, considering the process steps, I should think about the typical sequence of activities. Usually, it would go something like SS -> OP -> RC -> QI -> CA -> PT -> PK -> WS -> DT -> AS. But there might be some parallel steps or variations, but for simplicity, I'll assume a linear sequence.

I need to consider all possible pairs where one activity precedes another, not just directly connected ones. For example, SS precedes OP, RC, QI, etc., all the way to AS. Similarly, OP precedes RC, QI, CA, etc.

But the prompt says to include a representative subset, ensuring complexity by considering pairs separated by multiple steps. So I don't need every possible pair, but a good mix, including some that are not directly connected.

Let me list the activities in order:

1. SS
2. OP
3. RC
4. QI
5. CA
6. PT
7. PK
8. WS
9. DT
10. AS

Now, I'll think about the time between each pair. Since I don't have explicit numbers, I have to estimate based on typical processes.

Starting with SS to OP: Supplier selection to placing an order. This might involve negotiation, so perhaps a few days. Let's say an average of 5 days, which is 432000 seconds. Standard deviation could be a day, 86400 seconds.

OP to RC: Order placement to receiving components. Lead time varies, but for high-tech, maybe 10 days on average, with a week of deviation. 864000 seconds average, 604800 stdev.

RC to QI: Receiving to inspection. Probably same day, but could take a day or two. Maybe 1 day average, 12 hours stdev. 86400, 43200.

QI to CA: Inspection to assembly. If inspection is quick, maybe same day. Average 1 day, stdev half a day. 86400, 43200.

CA to PT: Assembly to testing. Testing might be done the next day. Average 1 day, stdev 12 hours. 86400, 43200.

PT to PK: Testing to packaging. Packaging could be same day as testing. Average 1 day, stdev 6 hours. 86400, 21600.

PK to WS: Packaging to storage. Immediate, maybe a few hours. Average 4 hours, stdev 2 hours. 14400, 7200.

WS to DT: Storage to distribution. Could be same day or a week. Average 3 days, stdev 2 days. 259200, 172800.

DT to AS: Distribution to after-sales. Support starts after distribution, maybe same day or a few days. Average 1 day, stdev 12 hours. 86400, 43200.

Now, considering some indirect pairs:

SS to RC: Supplier selection to receiving. That's SS -> OP -> RC. So average might be 5 + 10 = 15 days, which is 1,296,000 seconds. Stdev would be sqrt( (5 days stdev)^2 + (10 days stdev)^2 ), but maybe just average the stdevs? Or keep it higher. Maybe 15 days average, stdev 10 days. 1,296,000, 864,000.

SS to PT: From SS to PT, that's SS->OP->RC->QI->CA->PT. So average would be 5+10+1+1+1 = 18 days, 1,555,200 seconds. Stdev could be 10+7+1+1+1 = 20 days? Or maybe 1,555,200 average, stdev 1,296,000.

OP to QI: OP->RC->QI. 10 +1 = 11 days, 950,400 seconds. Stdev 604800 + 43200 = maybe 648,000.

RC to PT: RC->QI->CA->PT. 1+1+1=3 days, 259,200 seconds. Stdev 43200*3 = 129,600.

QI to PK: QI->CA->PT->PK. 1+1+1=3 days, 259,200. Stdev same as above.

CA to WS: CA->PT->PK->WS. 1+1+4=6 hours? Wait, PK to WS is 4 hours, so CA to PT is 1 day, PT to PK 1 day, PK to WS 4 hours. So total is 2 days and 4 hours, which is 2.0833 days, 180,000 seconds. Stdev would be sum of individual stdevs: 43200 + 43200 + 7200 = 93,600.

PT to DT: PT->PK->WS->DT. 1 day + 4 hours + 3 days = 4.0833 days, 350,400 seconds. Stdev 21,600 + 7,200 + 172,800 = 201,600.

PK to AS: PK->WS->DT->AS. 4 hours +3 days +1 day= 4.1667 days, 360,000 seconds. Stdev 7200 +172,800 +43,200= 223,200.

I think that's a good mix. I'll include these pairs along with some directly connected ones to make the dictionary comprehensive but not too lengthy.

This dictionary includes a mix of directly connected and indirect activity pairs, providing a comprehensive temporal profile for the supply chain process.
