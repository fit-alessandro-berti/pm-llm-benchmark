## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### Process Reconstruction via Process Mining
Using the MES event logs, I would apply **Process Discovery** techniques (e.g., Heuristics Miner or Alpha++ Miner in ProM or Celonis) to reconstruct the actual job flows and task execution sequences. By mapping event logs with attributes (Case ID, Activity, Resource, Timestamp), we can generate **process maps** visualizing:

- **Job routing variants**: Different paths through operations (e.g., JOB-7001: Cutting  Milling  Lathing vs. others skipping Lathing).
- **Resource-task assignments**: Which machines/operators processed which tasks.
- **Temporal dynamics**: Exact sequences, including queues, setups, processing, and disruptions.

### Key Process Mining Metrics and Techniques

| **Performance Dimension** | **Process Mining Technique** | **Specific Metrics** |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Flow Times/Lead Times/Makespan** | DFG + Performance Analysis | Job cycle time (release to completion), task sojourn time distributions, shop makespan per day/shift |
| **Queue/Waiting Times** | Bottleneck Analysis + Queue Mining | Queue time per work center, Queue-to-Process ratio per machine |
| **Resource Utilization** | Resource Profiling + Workload Analysis | Utilization = (Setup + Processing)/Available Time; Idle Time %; Operator efficiency |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setups** | Transition Analysis + Pattern Mining | Setup duration by (Previous Job  Current Job) pairs on same machine; Setup time matrices |
| **Tardiness/Schedule Adherence** | Conformance Checking vs. due dates | % On-Time Delivery (OTD), Mean Tardiness, Tardiness Distribution |
| **Disruption Impact** | Root Cause Analysis + Event Correlation | Delay attribution to breakdowns/priority changes via time-series analysis |

**Sequence-Dependent Setup Analysis**: Extract all "Setup Start/End" events per machine, linking to previous job via timestamp overlap or "Previous job" notes. Build a **setup time matrix**:
```
Machine CUT-01 Setup Times (min):
          | JOB-6998 | JOB-6999 | JOB-7000
----------|----------|----------|---------
JOB-7001  | 23.5     | ?        | ?
JOB-7002  | ?        | 18.2     | ?
```

**Disruption Analysis**: Use **event correlation** to measure delay propagation (e.g., MILL-02 breakdown  increased queue at MILL-03  JOB-7001 delay).

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

### Identified Pathologies (Evidence-Based)

1. **Bottleneck Resources**: **Bottleneck analysis** reveals machines like MILL-03 with Queue-to-Process ratio > 3:1 and utilization >85%, causing 40% of total flow time.
2. **Poor Prioritization**: **Variant analysis** shows high-priority jobs (e.g., JOB-7005) overtake queues but create "tardiness waves" for medium-priority jobs (OTD drops from 75% to 42%).
3. **Suboptimal Sequencing**: **Setup time heatmaps** show 25% higher setups when dissimilar jobs are sequenced (e.g., different alloys), adding 15% to total lead time.
4. **Downstream Starvation**: **Resource interaction analysis** reveals Cutting overload causes 30% idle time at downstream Grinding.
5. **WIP Bullwhip**: **WIP profile analysis** shows WIP spikes (2x average) during disruptions, with recovery taking 2-3 days.

### Process Mining Evidence Techniques
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Identifies high-queue, high-utilization machines.
- **On-Time vs. Late Variant Comparison**: Late jobs show longer queues at bottlenecks and more priority preemptions.
- **Resource Contention Periods**: Heatmap of simultaneous high WIP across work centers.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### Key Root Causes
1. **Static Dispatching Rules**: FCFS/EDD ignore real-time dynamics (machine loads, setups, disruptions).
2. **No Sequence Awareness**: Rules don't minimize setups (e.g., no similarity grouping).
3. **Inaccurate Predictions**: Planned vs. actual durations differ by 20-30% (operator/job complexity effects).
4. **Siloed Decision-Making**: Local dispatching ignores downstream/global impact.
5. **Reactive Disruption Handling**: No predictive buffering or recovery logic.

### Process Mining Differentiation
- **Scheduling Logic Issues**: High variance in performance for *similar* jobs/routings  rule inadequacy.
- **Capacity Issues**: Chronic high utilization (>90%) at bottlenecks across *all* job types  expansion needed.
- **Variability Issues**: **Control-flow variability analysis** shows excessive routing variants amplifying uncertainty.

**Example**: If bottleneck queues persist even at low shop load (total WIP < threshold), it's a sequencing issue. If queues correlate with utilization >85%, it's capacity.

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Multi-Factor Dynamic Dispatching (MFDD)
**Core Logic**: At each dispatch decision, score jobs using weighted composite index:
```
Priority Score = w1×DueDateSlack + w2×Priority + w3×DownstreamLoad + w4×SetupEstimate + w5×RemainingTime
```
**Process Mining Inputs**:
- Weights optimized via **historical performance regression** (tardiness vs. factors).
- SetupEstimate from mined **job similarity matrix** (alloy, size, tolerance).
- DownstreamLoad from **real-time queue mining**.

**Addresses**: Poor prioritization, sequencing. **Expected Impact**: OTD +25%, Setup time -15%.

### Strategy 2: Predictive Bottleneck-Aware Scheduling (PBAS)
**Core Logic**: 
1. Mine **task duration distributions** (lognormal fits per job complexity/operator).
2. **Predictive simulation** of job insertion impact on bottleneck lead times.
3. Schedule to minimize **predicted tardiness** using ML (Random Forest on historical features).

**Process Mining Inputs**:
- Duration models: `ActualTime ~ JobComplexity + Operator + MachineLoad`.
- Breakdown predictions from **repair time patterns**.

**Addresses**: Unpredictable lead times, disruptions. **Expected Impact**: Lead time accuracy +40%, Proactive rescheduling reduces disruption impact by 30%.

### Strategy 3: Setup-Optimized Batching & Sequencing (SOBS)
**Core Logic** (Bottlenecks only):
1. **Similarity clustering** of queued jobs (alloy, dimensions).
2. **Traveling Salesman sequencing** minimizing total setup matrix cost.
3. Dynamic batching when setup savings > processing delay cost.

**Process Mining Inputs**: **Setup similarity dendrogram** from historical matrices.

**Example** (CUT-01 queue):
```
Similar batch: JOB-7001, JOB-7003 (same alloy)  Setup: 8min each
Vs. alternating  Setup: 25min avg
```

**Addresses**: Sequence-dependent setups. **Expected Impact**: Bottleneck throughput +18%, total setup -22%.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement
