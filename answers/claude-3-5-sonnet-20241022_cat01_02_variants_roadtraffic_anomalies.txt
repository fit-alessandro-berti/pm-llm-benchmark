Looking at the variants, here are the main process-specific anomalies:

1. Order Violations:
- "Payment" appearing before "Send Fine" in some variants (e.g., "Create Fine -> Payment -> Send Fine")
- "Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture" appearing before "Insert Fine Notification" in some cases
- Some variants show "Payment" occurring multiple times in sequence (up to 4 times)

2. Late Penalties:
- Cases where "Add penalty" appears after "Payment"
- Variants where "Add penalty" occurs after "Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture"

3. Collection Inconsistencies:
- Some fines go directly to "Send for Credit Collection" after standard steps
- Other fines go to collection only after failed appeals
- Cases where "Send for Credit Collection" occurs after "Payment"

4. Appeal Process Variations:
- Multiple paths for appeals (Prefecture vs. Judge)
- Some appeal processes lack notification steps
- Cases where appeal processes are initiated but lack complete resolution steps

5. Performance Anomalies:
- Significant performance variations for similar paths (e.g., variants with "Appeal to Judge" show very different performance times)
- Some longer sequences (with more steps) showing shorter performance times than simpler variants

These anomalies suggest issues with process standardization and potential compliance problems in the fine management system.
