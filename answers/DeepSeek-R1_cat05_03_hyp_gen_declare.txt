### **Anomalies Identified**  
1. **Contradiction Between Precedence and Noncoexistence**  
   - The `precedence` rule for "C" (Close) requires only "R" (Receive) to precede it, allowing claims to skip intermediate steps (A, E, P, N).  
   - The `noncoexistence` rule forbids "E" (Evaluate) and "C" (Close) from coexisting, contradicting the intended flow where "E" must precede "C".  

2. **Weak Responded Existence for Evaluation**  
   - The `responded_existence` rule allows "A" (Assign) to occur *before or after* "E" (Evaluate), violating the requirement that adjusters must be assigned *before* evaluation.  

3. **Missing Constraints for Critical Steps**  
   - No rules enforce "P" (Approve) or "N" (Notify), allowing claims to bypass approval or customer notification entirely.

### **Hypotheses for Anomalies**  
1. **Over-Prioritization of Speed**  
   - The loose `precedence` rule for "C" might reflect pressure to close claims quickly, sacrificing compliance with intermediate steps.  

2. **Misinterpretation of Noncoexistence**  
   - The `noncoexistence` rule may have been intended to prevent concurrent evaluation and closure but was misconfigured to block sequential execution.  

3. **Incremental Policy Changes**  
   - New requirements (e.g., mandatory adjuster assignment) might have been added without updating existing constraints (e.g., `responded_existence`).  

4. **Data-Driven Bias**  
   - Historical data with frequent skipped steps (e.g., unapproved claims) could have skewed automated constraint discovery.

### **SQL Verification Strategies**  

#### **1. Claims Closed Without Evaluation**  
```sql  
SELECT c.claim_id  
FROM claims c  
WHERE EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce  
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'  
)  
AND NOT EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce  
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'  
);  
```  

#### **2. Evaluation and Closure Coexistence**  
```sql  
SELECT claim_id  
FROM claim_events  
WHERE activity IN ('E', 'C')  
GROUP BY claim_id  
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2;  
```  

#### **3. Evaluation Without Prior Adjuster Assignment**  
```sql  
SELECT ce_eval.claim_id  
FROM claim_events ce_eval  
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_assign  
    ON ce_eval.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id  
    AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'  
    AND ce_assign.timestamp < ce_eval.timestamp  
WHERE ce_eval.activity = 'E'  
AND ce_assign.event_id IS NULL;  
```  

#### **4. Claims Missing Approval or Notification**  
```sql  
SELECT c.claim_id  
FROM claims c  
WHERE EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce  
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'  
)  
AND (  
    NOT EXISTS (  
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce  
        WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'P'  
    )  
    OR NOT EXISTS (  
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce  
        WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'N'  
    )  
);  
```  

#### **5. Adjuster Assignment After Evaluation**  
```sql  
SELECT ce_eval.claim_id  
FROM claim_events ce_eval  
JOIN claim_events ce_assign  
    ON ce_eval.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id  
    AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'  
    AND ce_assign.timestamp > ce_eval.timestamp  
WHERE ce_eval.activity = 'E';  
```  

These queries validate whether the anomalies in the DECLARE model align with real-world process deviations.
