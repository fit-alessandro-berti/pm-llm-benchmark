<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the goal is to write a DuckDB SQL query that filters out certain cases based on specific conditions and then returns all events except those from the filtered cases. Let me break down the requirements first.

First, the query needs to identify cases that have the sequence of three activities: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' in that exact order without any other events in between. Then, among those cases, we need to consider only those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence is more than 5 days. Finally, we should exclude all events from such cases, returning everything else.

Hmm, okay. Let's start with the first part: finding cases with that exact sequence of three activities in succession. To do this, I need to track the order of activities within each case. Since the events are timestamped, I can order them by timestamp and check the sequence.

One approach for detecting sequences in event logs is to use window functions. For each event, I can get the next activity and the one after that, then check if they form the required sequence. Let's see:

For each row in the event_log, I can look at the current activity, the next activity (lead over 1), and the next+next activity (lead over 2). But I need to ensure that these three are consecutive events in the same case. So, the case_id must be the same for all three. 

Wait, the lead function's default partition is the same partitioning, so if I partition by case_id and order by timestamp, then the lead activities would be the next ones in the same case. That makes sense.

So, for each event, if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next one (lead(1)) should be 'Create Order', and the one after that (lead(2)) should be 'Confirm Order'. If that's true for any row in the case, then that case has the sequence. 

But I have to be careful because that sequence might not be the only three in the case, but we just need at least one occurrence of that exact trio in a row. So, if any such triplet exists in a case, that case is considered as having the sequence.

Once I find such cases, the next step is to check the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence. Wait, but the time between the second and third events (Create Order and Confirm Order) in the triplet must be more than 5 days.

Hmm, so first, for each triplet that matches the sequence, we need to calculate the time difference between the second and third events. Then, if any such triplet in the case has a difference exceeding 5 days, then the case should be excluded.

Wait, the problem states: "Among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is more than 5 days."

Ah, right. So first, the case has to have the sequence. Then, among those cases, we select the ones where in that specific triplet, the time between Create and Confirm is >5 days. Those cases are the ones to exclude from the final result.

Therefore, the final result is all events except those cases that meet both conditions: the sequence exists and the time between those two is over 5 days.

So the plan is:

1. Find all cases where the three activities appear in sequence as specified. Let's call these cases that have the sequence.

2. For those cases, check if in the triplet (the three activities in order), the time between the second (Create Order) and third (Confirm Order) is more than 5 days. If yes, then those cases need to be excluded.

3. The final result is all events except those from such cases.

Therefore, the steps in SQL would involve:

- First, identifying which cases have the sequence. 

- Then, for those cases, check if any of their qualifying triplets meet the time condition. If yes, exclude the entire case.

- Then, return all events not in those excluded cases.

Alternatively, since we need to exclude cases where both conditions are met, perhaps we can first find all cases that meet both conditions, and then select all events except those cases.

So, first, let's get the list of cases to exclude (those with the sequence and the time condition), then subtract those cases from the entire event_log.

Let me think about how to structure this. Let's start with the first part: detecting the sequence.

To detect the sequence, for each row, we can check if the next two activities are the required ones. Let me structure this:

SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,

LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,

LEAD(activity,2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,

LEAD(timestamp,2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp

FROM event_log;

Then, for each row, if activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', next_activity is 'Create Order', and next_next_activity is 'Confirm Order', then this triplet exists in the case. 

So, the first condition is that there exists at least one such triplet in the case.

Additionally, for such cases, we need to check the time between the second and third event in that triplet. The time between the second (Create Order) and third (Confirm Order) must be more than 5 days. 

Wait, the second event's timestamp is the timestamp of the 'Create Order' event, and the third's timestamp is the 'Confirm Order' one. So the time difference is next_next_timestamp (third event's timestamp) minus the second event's timestamp. Wait, no: the second event's timestamp would be LEAD(timestamp,1), but the third is LEAD(timestamp,2). Wait, perhaps it's better to structure it as:

The triplet's three events are:

1. Current row: Approve Purchase Requisition with timestamp t1.

2. Next row (next_activity) is Create Order with timestamp t2.

3. Next_next row is Confirm Order with timestamp t3.

So the time between the Create Order and Confirm Order is t3 - t2. We need that difference to be greater than 5 days.

Wait, the problem says the time between the Create Order and Confirm Order of that sequence must be more than 5 days. So for the triplet, the time between the second and third events (Create Order and Confirm Order) must be over 5 days.

Therefore, for each triplet that matches the activity sequence, calculate the time difference between the second and third events. If any such triplet in the case has that difference >5 days, then the case is to be excluded.

Therefore, the steps would be:

1. For each case, check if there exists at least one triplet of events in the sequence (Approve -> Create -> Confirm), and in that triplet, the time between Create and Confirm is more than 5 days.

2. Any case that has at least one such triplet is to be excluded.

Therefore, the excluded cases are those where:

EXISTS (a triplet where the activities are in order, and their timestamps have the required time difference).

Hmm, this seems a bit complex. Let me think of how to structure this in SQL.

Alternatively, perhaps using a CTE to first find all cases that have such triplets, and then check the timing condition for those triplets.

Alternatively, for each case, we can look for any instances of the three activities in order, and for those instances, check the time between the second and third.

Alternatively, perhaps using a window function to capture the needed data, then aggregate.

Let me try to outline the steps in code:

First, create a CTE that, for each triplet occurrence in a case, calculates the time between Create and Confirm.

Wait, perhaps first, for each row where the triplet exists, we can note the necessary timestamps and check the time between the second and third.

Alternatively, for each row where the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', check the next two activities and their timestamps.

Let me structure this step by step.

First, let's find all the triplets in the event log that form the required sequence:

SELECT case_id,

       timestamp AS approve_time,

       LEAD(timestamp) OVER w AS create_time,

       LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER w AS confirm_time,

       activity,

       LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_activity,

       LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_activity

FROM event_log

WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)

WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

AND LEAD(activity) OVER w = 'Create Order'

AND LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w = 'Confirm Order'

;

Wait, that would give me all the starting points of the triplet (i.e., the Approve event that is followed by Create and then Confirm). So for each such occurrence, I can compute the time between Create and Confirm (create_time and confirm_time). Wait, actually, the Create Order's timestamp is the second in the triplet, and Confirm is the third. So the time difference would be confirm_time - create_time.

Wait, the 'Approve' is the first, then 'Create' is the next, then 'Confirm'. So for each such triplet, the time between Create and Confirm is confirm_time - create_time. 

Therefore, for each such triplet, if (confirm_time - create_time) > interval '5 days', then that triplet is part of the condition for exclusion.

Therefore, the cases that have at least one such triplet (i.e., a triplet where the time between Create and Confirm is over 5 days) must be excluded.

Therefore, the excluded cases are those where there exists at least one triplet in their events where the three activities are in order and the time between Create and Confirm is >5 days.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. Find all cases where there exists at least one triplet of events in the required sequence, and in that triplet, the time between Create and Confirm is >5 days.

Once we have those case_ids, we can exclude all events from those cases.

Therefore, the final query would be:

SELECT * 

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (

    (SELECT case_id 

     FROM event_log

     WHERE ... the triplet exists and time condition met ... )

)

But how to structure the subquery?

Alternatively, the subquery needs to find all case_ids that have at least one occurrence of the triplet where the time between Create and Confirm is more than 5 days.

Let me structure the subquery as:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id

FROM event_log

WHERE EXISTS (

    SELECT 1

    FROM event_log e2

    WHERE e2.case_id = event_log.case_id

    AND e2.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND LEAD(e2.activity) OVER w = 'Create Order'

    AND LEAD(e2.activity, 2) OVER w = 'Confirm Order'

    AND DATEDIFF('day', LEAD(e2.timestamp), 2, e2.timestamp) ... wait, perhaps better to calculate the time difference between the Create and Confirm times.

Wait, perhaps using window functions in a CTE.

Alternatively, here's an approach using a CTE to first find all triplets in the log that match the activity sequence, then check the time between the second and third events in those triplets, and collect the case_ids where this time exceeds 5 days.

Let me try to write this as a CTE.

First, let's create a CTE that captures all the relevant triplets and their timing.

Let me define:

WITH triplet_candidates AS (

    SELECT case_id,

           e1.timestamp as approve_time,

           e2.timestamp as create_time,

           e3.timestamp as confirm_time,

           e1.activity as activity1,

           e2.activity as activity2,

           e3.activity as activity3

    FROM event_log e1

    JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.timestamp = LEAD(e1.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY e1.case_id ORDER BY e1.timestamp)

    JOIN event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.timestamp = LEAD(e2.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY e2.case_id ORDER BY e2.timestamp)

    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'

    AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'

)

Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated with joins. Maybe a better approach is to use window functions to check for the activities and times.

Alternative approach:

For each row in the event_log, we can check if the next two activities form the required sequence. 

So, using window functions, for each row where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', we can check the next two activities and timestamps.

So:

WITH candidate_events AS (

    SELECT *, 

        LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_act,

        LEAD(timestamp) OVER w AS next_time,

        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER w AS next_next_time

    FROM event_log

    WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)

)

SELECT case_id,

    CASE 

        WHEN activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 

        AND next_act = 'Create Order' 

        AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order' 

        THEN 1 

        ELSE 0 

    END AS is_triple,

    TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) AS time_diff

FROM candidate_events

WHERE (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 

    AND next_act = 'Create Order' 

    AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order')

)

So for each occurrence of such a triplet, compute the time difference between the second and third events (next_time is the Create Order's timestamp, and next_next_time is the Confirm Order's timestamp. So the difference is next_next_time - next_time.

Wait, wait, the triplet is:

Current row's activity: Approve (activity)

next_act is next row's activity (Create Order)

next_next_act is the third row's activity (Confirm Order)

The timestamps for Create is next_time, and Confirm is next_next_time.

Thus, the time difference is next_next_time - next_time.

We need that difference >5 days.

Therefore, in the CTE, for each such triplet occurrence (rows where the activity and the next two are in the sequence), compute this difference, and then find cases where any such triplet has a difference >5 days.

Therefore, the subquery to find excluded cases would be:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id

FROM (

    SELECT case_id,

        TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) AS time_diff

    FROM candidate_events

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND next_act = 'Create Order'

    AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

) AS valid_triplets

WHERE time_diff > 5

Wait, but TIMESTAMPDIFF in DuckDB can calculate the difference in days. Wait, need to confirm the function. In DuckDB, the function to calculate the difference between two timestamps can be done via (next_next_time - next_time), but need to convert that to days.

Alternatively, use TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time). Note that TIMESTAMPDIFF returns the difference in days between the two timestamps. Wait, but the order matters: TIMESTAMPDIFF(unit, start, end) gives the difference between end and start.

Wait, in the triplet, the Create Order's timestamp is next_time, Confirm is next_next_time. So the time between Create and Confirm is next_next_time - next_time. 

Therefore, the difference in days would be (next_next_time - next_time) / interval '1 day' ?

Alternatively, DuckDB has a function called DATEDIFF which can be used. For example, DATEDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) gives the number of days between next_time and next_next_time. But I need to confirm the exact function.

Alternatively, compute the difference using division:

(DATE_PART('epoch', next_next_time - next_time)::INT / (60*60*24) AS days_diff

But perhaps it's easier to use TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time). Let me check DuckDB's documentation.

Wait, in DuckDB, the TIMESTAMPDIFF function is used as TIMESTAMPDIFF(unit, start, end). The unit can be 'day', so TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) would give the difference in days between next_time and next_next_time. But the sign depends on order. Since next_next_time is later than next_time (since the events are ordered by timestamp), the result will be positive.

So, the difference in days is TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time).

So, in the CTE, for each triplet row, compute that difference. If any such triplet in the case has this difference >5, then the case is excluded.

Therefore, the excluded case IDs are those that have at least one triplet where the time difference between Create and Confirm is >5 days.

Putting this together, the subquery for excluded cases would be:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id

FROM (

    SELECT case_id,

           TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) AS time_diff

    FROM candidate_events

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND next_act = 'Create Order'

    AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

) AS relevant_triplets

WHERE time_diff > 5

So, the CTE candidate_events would be the same as the previous candidate_events.

Wait, but maybe I need to structure this in a CTE first.

Alternatively, let me structure the query step by step.

First, find all the candidate triplets (the three activities in order). For each such triplet, compute the time between the second and third.

Then, if any triplet in the case has this time_diff >5, the case is excluded.

Therefore, the excluded case IDs are those where exists a row in the triplet_candidates where time_diff >5.

Therefore, the subquery for excluded cases is:

SELECT case_id

FROM (

    SELECT case_id, 

           TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', coalesce(next_time, 0), next_next_time) AS time_diff

    FROM (

        SELECT case_id,

               activity,

               LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

               LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_act,

               LEAD(timestamp) OVER w AS next_time,

               LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER w AS next_next_time

        FROM event_log

        WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)

    ) AS triplet_candidates

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND next_act = 'Create Order'

    AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

)

WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) > 5

GROUP BY case_id

HAVING COUNT(*) >=1 

Wait, perhaps better to structure it as:

The subquery for excluded case_ids:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id

FROM (

    SELECT case_id,

           TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) AS time_diff

    FROM (

        SELECT case_id,

               activity,

               LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

               LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_act,

               LEAD(timestamp) OVER w AS next_time,

               LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER w AS next_next_time

        FROM event_log

        WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)

    ) AS w

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND next_act = 'Create Order'

    AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

) AS triplet_data

WHERE time_diff >5

Thus, the CTE would first get all the triplet candidates with their timestamps, filter for the three activities in order, compute the time difference, then check if that's over 5 days.

So the excluded cases are those case_ids where there exists a triplet where time_diff >5.

Once we have those case_ids, the final query is event_log where case_id not in (excluded_case_ids).

Putting it all together in SQL:

WITH triplet_info AS (

    SELECT case_id,

           TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) AS time_diff,

           activity,

           LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

           LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_act,

           LEAD(timestamp) OVER w AS next_time,

           LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER w AS next_next_time

    FROM event_log

    WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)

),

triplet_candidates AS (

    SELECT case_id,

           TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) AS time_diff

    FROM triplet_info

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

        AND next_act = 'Create Order'

        AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

)

SELECT * 

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM triplet_candidates WHERE time_diff >5)

Wait, no, not exactly. Because triplet_candidates has all the triplets that form the sequence, and we need to select the cases where any of their triplet_candidates has time_diff >5.

Therefore, the excluded cases are those where any such triplet has time_diff >5.

Therefore, the excluded case_ids are:

SELECT case_id FROM triplet_candidates WHERE time_diff >5

So the main query would be selecting all events where case_id not in (SELECT case_id FROM triplet_candidates WHERE time_diff >5).

Wait, but the triplet_candidates can have multiple entries for the same case (if there are multiple such triplets in a case), so using DISTINCT in the subquery.

So, the excluded case list is:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM triplet_candidates WHERE time_diff >5

Therefore, the final query would be:

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (

    (SELECT DISTINCT case_id 

     FROM (

        SELECT case_id,

               TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) AS time_diff

        FROM (

            SELECT case_id,

                activity,

                LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

                LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_act,

                LEAD(timestamp) OVER w AS next_time,

                LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER w AS next_next_time

            FROM event_log

            WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)

        ) AS triplet_candidates

        WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

        AND next_act = 'Create Order'

        and next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

     ) AS triplet_with_time

     WHERE time_diff >5

 )

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to first get all the triplet candidates with their time differences, then get the case_ids where any of their triplet candidates have a time_diff >5.

Putting this into a subquery:

So, the full query would be:

WITH triplet_data AS (

    SELECT case_id,

           TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', LEAD(timestamp) OVER w, LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER w) AS time_diff,

           activity,

           LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

           LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_act

    FROM event_log

    WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)

),

filtered_triplets AS (

    SELECT case_id, time_diff

    FROM triplet_data

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND next_act = 'Create Order'

    AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

),

excluded_cases AS (

    SELECT DISTINCT case_id

    FROM filtered_triplets

    WHERE time_diff >5

)

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)

Wait, but the time_diff in the triplet_data is calculated as the difference between the second and third events. Wait, actually, the triplet_data's time_diff should be calculated as the difference between next_next_time (Confirm's timestamp) minus next_time (Create's timestamp). So the TIMESTAMPDIFF would be:

TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) would give the days between Create and Confirm.

Wait, TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) gives the number of days between next_time and next_next_time. So if that is >5, then that triplet qualifies.

Wait, let me think again:

In the triplet_data CTE, the time_diff would be the difference between the third and second event's timestamps.

Therefore, in the filtered_triplets CTE, the time_diff is calculated as TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) ?

Wait, in the base CTE:

The triplet_data's time_diff should be the difference between the Confirm's timestamp and Create's timestamp. 

Wait, in the triplet_data CTE:

The variables would be:

current row's activity is Approve,

next_act is Create,

next_next_act is Confirm.

The timestamps for those are:

current row's timestamp: the Approve's time.

Next row's (the Create) timestamp is next_time.

Next_next row (Confirm) is next_next_time.

Thus, the time between Create and Confirm is next_next_time - next_time, which is expressed in days via TIMESTAMPDIFF.

Wait, TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) would give the number of days between next_time and next_next_time, so if that's >5, then that triplet's time is sufficient.

Therefore, in the filtered_triplets, we select those where time_diff >5.

Wait, but in the CTE triplet_data, how is time_diff calculated?

Wait, maybe in the first CTE:

triplet_data is:

SELECT case_id,

       TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', LEAD(timestamp) OVER w, LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER w) AS time_diff,

       activity,

       LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

       LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_act

    FROM event_log

    WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER by timestamp)

Wait, that's not quite right. Wait, the LEAD(timestamp) over w would be the next timestamp, so for the current row (Approve), the next timestamp is the Create's, and the next_next is Confirm's.

So the time_diff is TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time (Create's time), next_next_time (Confirm's time)), which would be the days between Create and Confirm.

Therefore, in the triplet_data, the time_diff is the days between Create and Confirm.

Then, in the filtered_triplets, we pick those rows where activity is Approve, next_act is Create, next_next_act is Confirm, and time_diff >5.

Wait, so the filtered_triplets would be the triplet candidates that meet the activity sequence and have the time >5.

Wait, actually, the filtered_triplets is the triplet_candidates (those that have the activity sequence), and then among them, the ones with time_diff >5 are the ones to exclude.

So the excluded_case is the distinct case_ids from filtered_triplets where time_diff >5.

Putting it all together:

WITH triplet_info AS (

    SELECT case_id,

        activity,

        LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_act,

        LEAD(timestamp) OVER w AS next_time,

        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER w AS next_next_time

    FROM event_log

    WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER by timestamp)

),

excluded_cases AS (

    SELECT DISTINCT ti.case_id

    FROM triplet_info ti

    WHERE ti.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND ti.next_act = 'Create Order'

    AND ti.next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

    AND TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', ti.next_time, ti.next_next_time) >5

)

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)

Wait, that seems better.

Wait, in the triplet_info CTE, I have for each row the current activity, next activity, next_next activity, and their timestamps. 

Then, in the excluded_cases, we look for rows where:

- The current activity is Approve,

- next_act is Create,

- next_next_act is Confirm,

AND the time between next_time (Create's timestamp) and next_next_time (Confirm's timestamp) is >5 days.

Therefore, if any row in triplet_info for a case has those conditions, then that case is excluded.

So the excluded_cases CTE is selecting all case_ids where there exists a row in triplet_info meeting those conditions.

Therefore, the CASE_IDs in excluded_cases are the ones to exclude.

Therefore, the final query would exclude those cases.

Wait, but the WHERE clause in the excluded_cases CTE includes the condition on the time_diff. 

Wait, the TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) is the number of days between Create and Confirm. So if that is >5, then the case should be excluded.

Therefore, the subquery for excluded_cases is:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id

FROM triplet_info

WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

AND next_act = 'Create Order'

AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

AND (next_next_time - next_time) > (5 * 24*60*60) * 1000000000  -- if timestamp is in seconds or microseconds, but maybe better to use TIMESTAMPDIFF function.

Alternatively, using TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) >5.

Assuming TIMESTAMPDIFF returns days as a float, so >5.

Thus, the query:

WITH triplet_info AS (

    SELECT case_id,

           activity,

           LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

           LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_act,

           LEAD(timestamp) OVER w AS next_time,

           LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER w AS next_next_time

    FROM event_log

    WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)

),

excluded_case_ids AS (

    SELECT DISTINCT case_id

    FROM triplet_info

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND next_act = 'Create Order'

    AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

    AND TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) >5

)

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excludeds_case_ids)

Wait, but I might have a typo in the name (excludeds_case_ids vs excluded_cases). Let me correct that.

Wait, let's write the CTEs properly.

Wait, also, in the triplet_info, the columns are:

case_id,

activity,

next_act,

next_next_act,

next_time,

next_next_time.

Then, in the excluded_case_ids CTE, the conditions are:

activity is Approve,

next_act is Create,

next_next_act is Confirm,

AND the time between Create and Confirm (next_time and next_next_time) is more than 5 days.

Thus, the WHERE clause in the CTE is the rows that meet the activity sequence and the time condition.

Therefore, the CTE will have all the rows in the triplet_info that are part of a qualifying triplet that meets the time condition. 

Each such row's case_id is part of the excluded cases. 

So, the excluded cases are the distinct case_ids from this.

Therefore, the main query can then exclude those case_ids.

Now, I need to make sure that the TIMESTAMPDIFF is correct.

Another thing to consider is that sometimes, the LEAD function might return NULL if there aren't enough rows left. So we need to filter out cases where next_act or next_next_act are NULL. Because otherwise, the LEAD might return NULL, leading to errors.

So in the WHERE clause of the excluded_case_ids CTE, we need to ensure that next_act and next_next_act are not null. Because otherwise, the LEAD might be null, so we need to have the next_act and next_next_act not null.

So adding conditions like next_act is not null and next_next_act is not null?

Alternatively, in the WHERE clause in the CTE's WHERE clause:

activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

AND next_act = 'Create Order'

AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

This will automatically exclude rows where any of those next activities are null (since they can't equal the required strings if they are null). So that's okay.

Now, putting this all together.

Wait, also, in the triplet_info, the next_time and next_next_time must also be valid. But if the activity sequence is correct, then those timestamps are valid.

So the query structure seems okay.

Wait, but in the CTE triplet_info, the LEAD function is applied over the window. For the last two rows in a case, LEAD might return null. So the WHERE clause in the CTE's WHERE clause will filter out any rows where the next_act and next_next_act are not the required activities, so only the valid triplets are considered.

Thus, the final query would be:

WITH triplet_info AS (

    SELECT case_id,

        activity,

        LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

        LEad(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_act,

        LEad(timestamp) OVER w AS next_time,

        LEad(timestamp, 2) OVER w AS next_next_time

    FROM event_log

    WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER by timestamp)

),

excluded_case_ids AS (

    SELECT DISTINCT case_id

    FROM triplet_info

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND next_act = 'Create Order'

    AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'

    AND TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) >5

)

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_case_ids)

Wait, but in the triplet_info, for each row where the current activity is Approve, and next activities are Create and Confirm, then the case is considered, and if any of those rows in the case has a time_diff >5, then the case is excluded.

Therefore this should work.

Wait, but the TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) gives the days between the Create and Confirm. So if that's over 5, then the case is excluded.

Therefore, the CTE excluded_case_ids will have the case_ids where such a triplet exists with time_diff >5.

Therefore, the final query will return all events not in those excluded cases.

But wait, is that all?

Wait, what about a case that has multiple such triplets, some with time_diff >5 and others not? The case would still be excluded because at least one triplet meets the condition.

Yes, because the excluded_case_ids selects any case that has at least one triplet where the time is >5 days.

Thus, the above query should work.

Wait, but let me check for possible errors.

Wait, the TIMESTAMPDIFF function in DuckDB: according to DuckDB's documentation, TIMESTAMPDIFF(unit, start, end) returns the difference between end and start in terms of the unit. So for days, TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) would be the number of days between next_time and next_next_time. Since next_time is the timestamp of the Create Order, next_next_time is the Confirm's timestamp. So the difference is (next_next_time - next_time) in days.

Thus, if that difference >5, then the case is excluded.

Another possible issue is the case where a case has multiple triplets. For example, a case might have two such triplets, one with time_diff 3 and another with 6. So the second one would qualify, so the case is excluded.

So the query is correct in that case.

Now, let's check the code:

Wait, in the CTE triplet_info, the LEAD functions are spelled with capital L? Probably not. Wait, in SQL, the function is LEAD, so I must have spelled them correctly. Let me correct that:

In the CTE:

LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_act,

LEAD(activity,2) OVER w as next_next_act,

LEAD(timestamp) OVER w as next_time,

LEAD(timestamp,2) OVER w as next_next_time

Wait, the syntax for LEAD is LEAD(expression, offset, default) OVER window. So in the triplet_info:

LEAD(activity, 1) would have offset 1 (default is 1, so just LEAD(activity) is same as LEAD(activity, 1). But in the first LEAD (next_act), which is the next activity), that's offset 1. The next_next_act is offset 2.

Wait, in the triplet_info, the next_act is the next row's activity (offset 1), so the next_act is the next row's activity, which is the second activity in the triplet, and next_next_act is the third.

Wait, putting together:

The current row is the first activity (Approve), next is Create (offset1), next_next (offset2) is Confirm.

Thus, the code seems okay.

Another thing: the TIMESTAMPDIFF function in DuckDB.

Wait, DuckDB's TIMESTAMPDIFF function returns the number of units between the two timestamps. So the difference between next_next_time and next_time in days.

Wait, TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', next_time, next_next_time) gives the number of days between next_time and next_next_time. So if next_next_time is 6 days after next_time, it would be 6, so that case would be excluded.

Thus, the query should work.

Now, let's test this logic with some examples.

Sup

Testing example 1:

Case1 has the sequence Approve -> Create -> Confirm with time between Create and Confirm of 6 days. 

In triplet_info, the row for the Approve event would have next_act = Create, next_next_act = Confirm, and time_diff 6. So it would be included in excluded_case_ids.

Thus, case1 is excluded.

Case2 has the same sequence but with 3 days between Create and Confirm. Then the time_diff is 3, so not in excluded_case_ids. Thus, case2 is not excluded, so its events are included.

Another edge case: a case has the sequence but the time is exactly 5 days. Since it's not >5, so it's not excluded. Thus, that case's events stay in the result.

Another edge case: a case has the sequence but the time is 5.1 days (e.g., 5 days and 12 hours). That
