### Violations Identified:

1. **Case 2**  
   **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."  
   - The normative process mandates that "Authorization of payment" must precede "Package items" in the inventory-sufficient scenario.  
   - **Explanation:** In Case 2, after checking inventory, the system proceeds to "Package items" (09:30) *before* authorizing payment (10:30). This violates the constraint that payment authorization is a prerequisite to packaging. Without valid payment approval, preparing items for shipment is logically inconsistent.  

2. **Case 3**  
   **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."  
   - The normative process explicitly states that   cancelation, subsequent activities must involve "Close order," *not* shipping.  
   - **Explanation:** Case 3 follows the sequence: Cancel  Ship  Close. Shipping after cancellation is prohibited because canceled orders cannot be finalized by shipping. The presence of "Ship order" here directly contradicts the "Cancel order" activity, violating the exclusivity of post-cancellation workflows.  

3. **Case 5**  
   **Violation:** Missing "Package items" before "Ship order."  
   - The normative flow requires "Package items" to occur after authorization and before shipping in inventory-sufficient cases.  
   - **Explanation:** In Case 5, authorization (10:30) is followed by shipping (11:00) without a "Package items" step. This skips a mandatory intermediate activity, creating a gap in process integrity. Shipping items without packaging contradicts the requirement that items must be prepared before shipment.  

### Key Points of Ambiguity and Interpretation:
- **Payment Authorization Precedence:** While the normative process specifies "Authorize payment" *after* inventory check, there is no explicit mention of handling partial payment approvals or conditional releases. However, the normative text implies that payment must be explicitly authorized *before* any fulfillment-related steps (/ship).  
- **Cancellation Workflow:** The normative process does not address scenarios where cancellation might be reversed or involve partial fulfillment. In this context, "Ship order" after "Cancel order" is unambiguously forbidden.  
- **Missing Step in Case 5:** The absence of "Package items" creates a gap in the workflow. Interpretation: The omission is a procedural error, not a deviation to an "extraordinary circumstance," as the normative process does not permitting bypassing Packaging.  

### Non-Violating Cases:
- **Case 1**: Follows the "Normal Flow" (Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close) correctly.  
- **Case 4**: Follows the "Cancellation Flow" (Receive  Check  Cancel  Close) correctly.  

### Conclusion:
Cases 2, 3, and 5 violate the normative process due to sequence of activities, missing steps, and post-cancellation shipping. These deviations undermine process integrity, risking payment disputes (Case 2), fulfillment errors (Case 3), and incomplete shipments (Case 5). The normative process should enforce strict adherence to the defined preconditions for each activity.
