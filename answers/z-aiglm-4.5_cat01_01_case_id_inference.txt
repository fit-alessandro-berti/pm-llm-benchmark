Based on the event attributes and logical sequencing, the events can be grouped into three distinct cases using the following reasoning:

### Key Grouping Criteria:
1. **Patient Attributes**: `patient_age` and `patient_gender` are consistent within a patient's journey. Three unique combinations exist:
   - **Case A**: 45-year-old male (45M)
   - **Case B**: 62-year-old female (62F)
   - **Case C**: 28-year-old male (28M)

2. **Logical Activity Flow**: Activities follow a coherent sequence for each patient (e.g., registration  triage/consultation  procedures  discharge).

3. **Timestamp Order**: Events for each case occur in chronological order without temporal conflicts (e.g., no overlapping impossible activities like simultaneous surgeries for the same patient).

4. **Department Context**: Departments align with the patient journey (e.g., ER cases stay in ER/Laboratory/Radiology, Surgery cases stay in Surgery).

### Case Groupings:

#### **Case A: 45M (ER Patient)**
- **Events**: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
- **Journey**:  
  - Registration in ER (Event 1)   
  - Triage in ER (Event 4)   
  - X-ray in Radiology (Event 7)   
  - Doctor consultation in ER with fracture diagnosis (Event 12)   
  - Discharge from ER (Event 15).  
- **Why**: Consistent age/gender (45M), ER/Radiology departments, and logical injury-treatment-discharge sequence.

#### **Case B: 62F (ER Patient)**
- **Events**: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  
- **Journey**:  
  - Registration in ER (Event 2)   
  - Triage in ER (Event 5)   
  - Lab test requested in ER (Event 8)   
  - Lab test completed in Laboratory (Event 10)   
  - Doctor consultation in ER with infection diagnosis (Event 11)   
  - Prescription created in ER (Event 14)   
  - Discharge from ER (Event 17).  
- **Why**: Consistent age/gender (62F), ER/Laboratory departments, and logical infection-test-treatment-discharge sequence.

#### **Case C: 28M (Surgery Patient)**
- **Events**: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18  
- **Journey**:  
  - Registration in Surgery (Event 3)   
  - Doctor consultation in Surgery for scheduled surgery (Event 6)   
  - Surgery preparation in Surgery (Event 9)   
  - Surgery performed in Surgery (Event 13)   
  - Recovery room in Surgery (Event 16)   
  - Discharge from Surgery (Event 18).  
- **Why**: Consistent age/gender (28M), Surgery department throughout, and logical surgical journey from consultation to discharge.

### Validation:
- **No Attribute Conflicts**: Each case has unique `patient_age` + `patient_gender` combinations.  
- **Temporal Consistency**:  
  - Case A: Events span 08:05–08:30 (no overlaps).  
  - Case B: Events span 08:07–08:35 (lab test precedes consultation).  
  - Case C: Events span 08:07–08:40 (surgery prep precedes surgery).  
- **Logical Sequences**:  
  - ER cases (A and B) involve diagnostics/tests before treatment.  
  - Surgery case (C) follows a pre-op  surgery  post-op  discharge flow.  
- **Department Alignment**:  
  - Cases A/B use ER, Laboratory, and Radiology.  
  - Case C uses Surgery exclusively.  

### Final Case IDs:
- **Case A**: Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
- **Case B**: Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  
- **Case C**: Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
