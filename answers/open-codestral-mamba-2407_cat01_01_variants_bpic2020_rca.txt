Based on the data provided, it's difficult to identify specific root causes for the performance issues without more context or information. However, some potential factors that could contribute to performance issues in this process include:

1. Variance in processing times: The processing times for different paths through the process vary significantly, from a few hours to several days. This could be due to a number of factors, such as differences in the complexity of the requests, the availability of necessary approvers or budget owners, or differences in the time it takes for employees to submit or respond to requests.
2. Inconsistent or unclear communication: There may be inconsistencies or unclear communication in the process, leading to confusion or delays in approvals. This could result in requests being rejected or approved multiple times before they finally reach a final approval stage, causing delays and decreased performance.
3. Inefficient or ineffective process: The process itself may be inefficient or ineffective, leading to delays and decreased performance. For example, there may be unnecessary steps or approvals, or steps that are not clearly defined or communicated.
4. Resource constraints: There may be resource constraints, such as a lack of budget owners or approvers, or a shortage of employees to handle the requests. This could result in delays and decreased performance.
5. Data errors or inconsistencies: There may be data errors or inconsistencies in the process, such as missing or incomplete information, that cause delays and decreased performance.

To address performance issues, it may be necessary to address one or more of these factors. This could involve optimizing the process, improving communication, streamlining the process, providing additional resources, or addressing data errors or inconsistencies. Additionally, it may be helpful to analyze the data more closely to identify specific trends or patterns that could provide further insights into the root causes of performance issues.
