**Activity Renaming Justification:**

* **Verify Documents (Repeated):** This activity was renamed to more specific terms like **Executive Document Screening**, **Confirm Identity**, **Document Upload**, **Document Re-confirmation**, **Credential Verification**, **Outreach Call**, and others. These replacements pinpoint *who* performs the verification (Agent, Supervisor, Customer), *what* is being verified (IDs, credentials, discrepancies), and *how* (over the phone, in-person).

* **Call Customer (Repeated):** **Executive Document Screening**, **Initial Inquiry**, **Customer Outreach Call**, "Account Adjustment Call", and **Follow-Up Call** are examples. These signpost the reason for the call: screening, initial inquiry, resolving account discrepancies, or confirming adjustments.

* **Submit Additional (Repeated):** **Customer Document Upload** highlights the specific action taken, differentiating between general submission and a specific instance of document upload.
* **Adjust Account (Repeated):** Renamed to **Account Update** and **Internal Corrective Action** to indicate the context – either a proactive automation or a reactive response to identified issues.



This revised log aims for clarity by providing a contextual lens to each activity, making it easier to trace the flow of information and actions within each case.
