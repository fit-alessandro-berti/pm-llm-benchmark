 Based on the provided process data and considering only process-specific factors, here are some root causes that could be contributing to the performance issues:

1. **High Rejection Rates**: The frequent rejections by various roles (Admin, Supervisor, Budget Owner, Pre_Approver) lead to additional steps and delays in the process.
   - Admin rejects 5 declarations.
   - Supervisor rejects 6 declarations before final approval.
   - Budget Owner rejects 1 declaration.
   - Pre_Approver rejects 2 declarations before final approval.

   This causes employees to resubmit declarations multiple times, increasing the overall process time and reducing efficiency.

2. **Sequential Approval Process**: The current process flow requires linear approvals from Admin, Supervisor, Budget Owner (in some cases), and Pre_Approver (in some cases). This can cause bottlenecks if one role is slower than others or has a higher workload.
   - In the first case, Admin approval takes 2 steps, then Supervisor approval, then Payment Handled.
   - In the second case, there are additional approvals from Budget Owner and Supervisor before Payment Handled.

3. **Lack of Parallel Processing**: There's no indication that multiple approvals can occur simultaneously. Implementing parallel processing could significantly reduce overall process time.

4. **Inconsistent Final Approval**: In some cases, the final approval comes from Supervisor, while in others, it's the Budget Owner or Pre_Approver. This inconsistency might lead to confusion and further delays.

5. **Employee Resubmissions**: Employees have to resubmit declarations multiple times due to rejections. This increases the workload on both employees and approvers, causing inefficiencies.
   - In the third case, employees submit and get rejected 6 times before giving up.
   - In other cases, there are 3-4 resubmissions before final approval.

To improve performance, consider addressing these root causes by implementing parallel processing, reducing rejections through improved guidelines or training, and standardizing the final approval role.
