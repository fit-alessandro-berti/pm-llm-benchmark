 Based on the provided data, several process-specific root causes can be identified that contribute to performance issues:

1. **Rejections and Rework**:
   - The presence of multiple rejection paths significantly increases the time and effort required to complete a declaration. For example:
     - Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION (and so on)
   - These rejection loops, often leading to multiple submissions and approvals, add unnecessary delays.

2. **Multiple Approval Layers**:
   - The process variants indicate that some declarations require approval from multiple entities before final approval (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR). This adds complexity and time to the process.

3. **Frequency of Rejections**:
   - High frequency paths where rejections occur indicate frequent issues with initial submissions:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION (frequency = 174, performance = 727139.517)
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR (frequency = 57, performance = 1519728.789)
   - These rejections suggest potential issues with the initial submission quality or clarity of requirements.

4. **Supervisory Bottlenecks**:
   - Some paths show delays specifically at the SUPERVISOR stage:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR (frequency = 31, performance = 713794.452)
   - This suggests that the supervisory approval stage might be a bottleneck, possibly due to workload or other constraints.

5. **Missing Approvals**:
   - Paths where declarations are REJECTED due to MISSING indicate potential procedural issues or lack of clarity in required approvals:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING (frequency = 21, performance = 872310.667)
   - This suggests process gaps or lack of documentation leading to missed approvals.

6. **High Performance Costs in Specific Paths**:
   - Certain paths have significantly higher performance costs, indicating inefficiencies:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 174, performance = 727139.517)
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR (frequency = 57, performance = 1519728.789)
   - These high costs suggest that the process may need to be streamlined or that there are inefficiencies in these specific paths.

### Summary of Root Causes:
- **Rejections and multiple submissions** leading to increased cycle time.
- **Multiple approval layers** contributing to complexity and delays.
- **Supervisory bottlenecks** causing delays at the final approval stage.
- **Missing approvals** indicating procedural gaps or lack of clarity.
- **High performance costs** in specific paths suggesting inefficiencies.

Addressing these root causes through process improvement initiatives, such as streamlining approval steps, enhancing initial submission quality, and reducing rejections, can significantly improve overall performance.
