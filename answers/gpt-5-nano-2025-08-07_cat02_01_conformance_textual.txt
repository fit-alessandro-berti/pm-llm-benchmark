Here is the assessment of each case against the normative process and the reasons for any deviations.

Summary
- Compliant cases: Case 1, Case 4
- Non-compliant cases: Case 2, Case 3, Case 5

Detailed evaluation

Case 1
- Observed sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order
- Compliance reasoning:
  - Check inventory occurs before payment authorization.
  - Payment authorization occurs before packaging.
  - Packaging occurs before shipping.
  - Shipping occurs before closing.
  - Close order is final.
- Status: Compliant (follows the standard path for sufficient inventory).

Case 2
- Observed sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
- Compliance issues:
  - Package items occurs before Authorize payment. The normative rule requires Authorize payment after Check inventory and before Packaging.
  - Therefore, the sequence violates the rule: "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging."
- Status: Non-compliant. The packaging-before-authorization ordering is violated.

Case 3
- Observed sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order
- Compliance issues:
  - After Check inventory, the process should branch into either:
    - Sufficient stock path: Authorize payment -> Package -> Ship -> Close
    - Insufficient stock path: Cancel -> Close
  - In Case 3, cancellation occurs after authorization, which contradicts the intended branching: if stock is insufficient, there should be no payment authorization, no packaging, and no shipping.
  - Additionally, shipping occurs after cancellation, which is explicitly forbidden by the rule: "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation."
- Status: Non-compliant. Violates both the branching rule (do not authorize or ship if inventory is insufficient) and the prohibition on shipping after cancellation.

Case 4
- Observed sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order
- Compliance reasoning:
  - This matches the intended Insufficient Stock path: after checking inventory, cancel, then close.
  - No payment authorization, no packaging, no shipping occur after cancellation.
  - Close order is final.
- Status: Compliant. This aligns with the described alternate path for insufficient inventory.

Case 5
- Observed sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
- Compliance issues:
  - Packaging is missing entirely. The normative process requires "Package items" after authorization and before shipping.
  - Without packaging, shipping is not properly sequenced according to the described rules.
- Status: Non-compliant. Violates the required Packaging step and its ordering relative to Shipping.

Notes on interpretation
- The normative description states that after a stock check, if stock is insufficient you should Cancel and then Close (Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close). It also says Ship should occur only after Packaging and never after a cancellation, and that Authorize payment should occur after Check inventory and before Packaging.
- There is an implicit branching rule: if stock is sufficient, follow the “payment authorization  packaging  shipping  close” chain; if stock is insufficient, follow the “cancel  close” chain. Case 3 violates this branching by authorizing payment and shipping after a cancellation.
- Some ambiguities (e.g., whether an extraordinary path could place a cancellation before some checks) are resolved by treating the described branching and the explicit ordering constraints as binding for evaluation.

Final verdict
- Case 1: OK
- Case 2: Violation (Packaging before Authorization)
- Case 3: Violation (Shipping after Cancellation; improper branching; missing proper packaging)
- Case 4: OK (valid insufficient-stock path)
- Case 5: Violation (Missing Packaging; shipping without packaging)

If you’d like, I can map each case to a formal representation of the allowed sequences (e.g., automaton or constraint-based model) to automatically detect similar deviations in larger logs.
