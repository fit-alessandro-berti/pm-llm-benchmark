Looking at this supply chain process, I need to identify which pairs of activities might naturally occur in sequence across different process executions, then estimate their temporal distances based on typical supply chain operations.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Procurement activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (28800, 14400),      # 8 hours average, 4 hours deviation - supplier selection to order
    ('OP', 'RC'): (172800, 86400),     # 48 hours average, 24 hours deviation - order to receipt
    
    # Quality and assembly
    ('RC', 'QI'): (14400, 7200),       # 4 hours average, 2 hours deviation - receipt to inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 43200),      # 24 hours average, 12 hours deviation - inspection to assembly (may wait for components)
    
    # Production
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 129600),    # 72 hours average, 36 hours deviation - assembly to testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (72000, 36000),      # 20 hours average, 10 hours deviation - testing to packaging
    
    # Storage and distribution
    ('PK', 'WS'): (36000, 18000),      # 10 hours average, 5 hours deviation - packaging to storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (432000, 216000),    # 120 hours average, 60 hours deviation - storage to shipment
    
    # Post-sales
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 302400),    # 168 hours average, 84 hours deviation - delivery to support
    
    # Complex relationships with waiting periods
    ('SS', 'RC'): (201600, 100800),    # 56 hours average, 28 hours deviation - selection to receipt
    ('QI', 'PK'): (345600, 172800),    # 96 hours average, 48 hours deviation - inspection to packaging (through assembly/testing)
    ('CA', 'DT'): (432000, 216000),    # 120 hours average, 60 hours deviation - assembly to distribution
    ('OP', 'PK'): (259200, 129600),    # 72 hours average, 36 hours deviation - order to packaging
    
    # Long-cycle relationships
    ('SS', 'PT'): (345600, 172800),    # 96 hours average, 48 hours deviation
    ('RC', 'DT'): (518400, 259200),    # 144 hours average, 72 hours deviation
}
```

This temporal profile captures:
- **Direct sequential relationships** with realistic manufacturing delays
- **Indirect relationships** where activities may not be immediately consecutive but occur in sequence across different executions
- **Waiting periods** represented by longer average times with higher deviations
- **Complex supply chain dependencies** including quality gates and storage delays
- **Variability** appropriate for manufacturing processes (typically 50-100% of average)

The estimates reflect: short-cycle internal operations (hours), medium-cycle procurement and testing (days), long-cycle global supply chains (weeks), and post-sales support (weeks).
