The image presents a comprehensive diagram illustrating the process of lab testing, comprising three distinct sections: (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels, (b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes, and (c) Example of a performative speech act.

**Section (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels**

*   The flowchart is divided into two main sections: "Lab visit" and "Lab test".
*   The "Lab visit" section involves the following steps:
    *   Order entry
    *   Take blood sample
    *   Judge results
    *   Everything fine
    *   Send report
*   The "Lab test" section involves the following steps:
    *   Perform test
    *   Make report
    *   Finish lab test
*   The two sections are connected by two channels: "HIS" and "Order system".

**Section (b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes**

*   The class diagram illustrates the relationship between "Lab visit" and "Lab test".
*   The "Lab visit" class requires a "Lab test".

**Section (c) Example of a performative speech act**

*   The table provides an example of a performative speech act, which is a speech act that performs an action.
*   The table includes the following columns:
    *   Time
    *   Channel
    *   Sender
    *   Receivers
    *   Action
    *   Content
    *   Scope
    *   Direction

The image effectively conveys the complex process of lab testing through a clear and concise visual representation.
