**1. Cases Violating the Normative Process:**  
Cases **2**, **3**, and **5** violate the normative process.

**2. Explanation of Violations:**  

**Case 2**  
- **Violation:** "Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment."  
- **Rule Violated:** The normative process explicitly states that payment authorization must occur *before* packaging items. Payment authorization depends on confirming inventory sufficiency, and packaging should only follow successful authorization.  
- **Interpretation:** The sequence "Check inventory → Package items → Authorize payment" reverses the required order of "Authorize payment → Package items." This could lead to packaging items without confirming payment validity, risking financial loss.

**Case 3**  
- **Violation 1:** "Cancel order" occurs *after* "Authorize payment."  
  - **Rule Violated:** If inventory is insufficient (leading to cancellation), payment authorization should *never occur*. Authorization is only valid if inventory is confirmed sufficient.  
  - **Interpretation:** The process implies that inventory sufficiency determines the branch. If "Cancel order" follows "Check inventory," it suggests insufficient inventory, making "Authorize payment" invalid. Here, the sequence mixes incompatible paths.  

- **Violation 2:** "Ship order" occurs *after* "Cancel order."  
  - **Rule Violated:** Cancellation prohibits fulfillment activities (e.g., shipping).  
  - **Interpretation:** Shipping after cancellation is illogical and violates the process’s intent to halt fulfillment once an order is canceled.

**Case 5**  
- **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs *without* "Package items."  
- **Rule Violated:** The normative process mandates that items must be packaged before shipping.  
- **Interpretation:** Skipping packaging implies shipping unprepared items, which violates the logical and operational sequence. The step "Package items" is critical for ensuring order integrity before shipment.

**Ambiguity Resolution:**  
The normative description assumes inventory sufficiency is the sole branching condition. Cases like **3** (authorizing payment before cancellation) might reflect external issues (e.g., payment failure), but the textual description does not account for such scenarios. Thus, deviations from the inventory-driven branching logic are treated as violations.  

**Correct Cases:**  
- **Case 1** and **Case 4** follow the normative sequences (sufficient and insufficient inventory paths, respectively).
