Here are the main anomalies by case, with why they are problematic relative to a standard P2P flow (Approve PR  Issue PO  Receive Goods/Services  Vendor Invoice Received  3-way match  Release Payment  Close):

Case 1001 (mostly normal)
- Sequence follows best practice: PR created/approved  PO issued  goods received  invoice received  match  payment  close. No anomaly.

Case 1002 (multiple control and segregation-of-duties issues)
1) PO issued before PR approval
   - Activity order: Create PR  Issue PO  Approve PR.
   - Why problematic: Issuing a PO without prior approval bypasses budget/authority controls and increases risk of unauthorized spend.

2) Payment before approval, receipt, and matching
   - Activity order: Vendor Invoice Received  Release Payment  Approve PR  Receive Goods  Match Invoice to PO.
   - Why problematic: Paying before PR approval, goods receipt, and 3way match undermines core P2P controls, risking overpayment, fraud, duplicate/erroneous invoices, or paying for unreceived goods.

3) Goods received after payment
   - Why problematic: Cash out before confirming delivery exposes the company to non-delivery or disputes and weakens leverage with the vendor.

Overall: This case violates approval sequencing and 3way match discipline, indicating severe control breakdown.

Case 1003 (payment before invoice and goods receipt)
1) Payment released before invoice received and goods receipt
   - Activity order: Release Payment  Vendor Invoice Received  Receive Goods  Match Invoice to PO.
   - Why problematic: Payment without an invoice and receipt breaks standard accounting and control practices. There is no basis to pay (no invoice) and no confirmation of delivery (no GR). The later “Match Invoice to PO” is moot if payment already occurred, risking unmatched/late corrections and write-offs.

2) Match performed after payment
   - Why problematic: 3way match is intended to precede payment to prevent errors; performing it after payment reduces it to a detective control and may not prevent loss.

Case 1004 (goods receipt before PO issuance)
1) Goods received before PO issued
   - Activity order: Receive Goods  Issue PO.
   - Why problematic: Receiving without a PO suggests maverick buying or after-the-fact PO creation, which bypasses sourcing, terms negotiation, and budget approval. It complicates matching and increases price/terms risk.

2) Tight timing but otherwise plausible
   - After-the-fact PO is followed by invoice, match, payment. While the remainder is in order, the initial receipt-before-PO is a key control breach.

Summary of risk themes across anomalies
- Approval sequencing violations (PO before PR approval; payments before approvals).
- Payment before 3way match and before goods receipt/invoice.
- After-the-fact POs and receipts without prior authorization.
- These issues expose the organization to unauthorized spend, fraud, overpayment/duplicate payment, paying for undelivered goods, audit findings, and financial misstatements.
