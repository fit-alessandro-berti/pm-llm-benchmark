### Analysis of Event Logs

#### Normative Rules Violations:
1. **Case 2:**
   - **Violation:** The credit check was performed after risk assessment (Credit Check occurred at 08:20 on January 11th, while Risk Assessment was conducted before that).
     - This violates the sequence constraint where Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.
   - Additionally, there's an attempt to finalize documentation post-rejection. Finalize Documentation should not occur after a rejection decision but Case 2 has performed it at 10:00 on January 11th.

#### Desiderata Violations:
1. **Case 3:**
   - The credit check was initiated more than 24 hours (specifically, two days later) from the receipt of application.
     - This violates the preferred timing condition that suggests performing a Credit Check promptly within 24 hours after receiving an Application.
   - It took over 70 hours to inform the applicant about their loan decision (from January 14th's Loan Decision to January 16th Inform Applicant), which exceeds the recommended 48-hour window for informing applicants of their decisions.
   - There was no follow-up call conducted before closing the case. While this is a desideratum and not mandatory, it’s advisable to perform one to ensure clarity between all parties involved.

### Interpretation and Justification

**Case 2:** 
- The sequence error (Credit Check after Risk Assessment) suggests potential miscommunication or system malfunction, requiring process review for consistency.
- Finalizing documentation post-rejection indicates a procedural mistake that should be rectified through training on the loan application process steps.

**Case 3:**
- Delays in performing credit checks could be due to heavy workloads or operational constraints necessitating prioritization of applications. While it doesn’t violate rules, improved efficiency might expedite initial processing phases.
- The significant delay in informing applicants about their decisions can lead to dissatisfaction and potential loss of trust if consistent communication isn't maintained. Implementing better tracking systems for timely follow-ups could mitigate this issue.
- Not conducting a Follow-up Call suggests perhaps the decision was straightforward (likely based on clearly defined criteria), but maintaining best practices encourages proactive engagement with clients.

### Recommendations:
- For **Case 2**, ensure that system workflows strictly enforce the correct order of steps, possibly by setting up automated checks or reminders for staff to perform Credit Checks before Risk Assessments.
- For both **Cases 2 and 3**, consider reinforcing training programs focusing on process adherence and the importance of timely actions as per best practices.
- Implementing a follow-up mechanism could include automated reminders for managers or supervisors, ensuring all desiderata are at least attempted.

By addressing these points, the loan application process can be streamlined to enhance both compliance with strict rules and alignment with recommended best practices.
