Applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects can have significant benefits, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. Below, we outline the main benefits and challenges to consider:

### Main Benefits:

1. **Improved Scalability**: Decomposition allows for handling large and complex event logs by breaking them down into more manageable subsets. This enables process mining tools to perform more efficiently, reducing computational time and resource requirements.

2. **Enhanced Insights**: By focusing on specific subprocesses or elements of the process, decomposition facilitates a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the process's intricacies. This can lead to the identification of optimization opportunities that might be overlooked in a holistic, undifferentiated analysis.

3. **Simplified Communication**: Decomposed process models can be more accessible to stakeholders who are familiar with specific parts of the overall process. This simplification aids in communicating findings and proposed changes, enhancing stakeholder buy-in and participation in process improvement initiatives.

4. **Targeted Improvement Initiatives**: Decomposition enables the identification and prioritization of high-impact areas for improvement. By concentrating on the most problematic or inefficient subprocesses, organizations can maximize the return on investment (ROI) from their process mining efforts.

5. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: As processes evolve, decomposed models can be more easily updated or extended, allowing for agile response to changing operational landscapes or new strategic objectives.

### Main Challenges:

1. **Identification of Relevant Decomposition Points**: Determining the most effective way to decompose a process can be challenging. Incorrect decomposition can lead to fragmented insights that do not accurately represent the overall process dynamics.

2. **Context Loss**: Breaking down a process into smaller parts risks losing the broader contextual relationships between different subprocesses. Ensuring that the decomposed views still provide useful, actionable insights requires careful consideration.

3. **Integration of Results**: After analyzing decomposed subprocesses, integrating the findings to form a coherent overall improvement strategy can be complex. This step requires careful planning to ensure that localized improvements do not inadvertently worsen the overall process efficiency.

4. **Data Quality Issues**: Decomposition may exacerbate existing data quality issues if not all subprocesses have equally robust event logging. Managing and mitigating these disparities is crucial for reliable insights.

5. **Stakeholder Alignment**: With multiple, decomposed views of the process, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned with the overall strategy and goals can become more complicated. Effective communication and change management are essential to overcome this challenge.

6. **Tool Support and Limitations**: Not all process mining tools are equally adept at handling decomposition strategies, either in terms of functionality or scalability. Selecting the appropriate toolset that supports the chosen decomposition approach is vital for project success.

To effectively apply decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects, it's essential to:
- Carefully plan the decomposition approach aligned with project objectives.
- Utilize suitable process mining tools that support decomposition.
- Ensure robust data quality across all subprocesses.
- Maintain a holistic view to integrate and align all stakeholders with the overarching strategy.
