Let's go through the event logs to identify any deviations from the normative process described.

**Case 1:**
- Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order.
- Violation: No violation. This case follows the sequence where the order is received, inventory is checked, payment is authorized, items are packaged, shipped, and then closed. This matches the expected flow when inventory is sufficient.

**Case 2:**
- Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Package items, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
- Violation: The violation here is in the sequence of activities after checking inventory. It should be Authorize payment before packaging, but in Case 2, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." This deviates from the norm because authorization of payment is supposed to happen after confirming inventory and before packaging the items.

**Case 3:**
- Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order.
- Violation: Two violations occur here:
  - After checking inventory and before canceling the order, the process includes an authorization of payment. This is illogical because once an order is canceled, there's no point in proceeding with payment authorization or any fulfillment activities.
  - "Ship order" occurs after a cancellation has been made. According to the normative process, shipping should not happen after a cancellation.

**Case 4:**
- Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Cancel order, Close order.
- Violation: No violation. This case follows the correct sequence for insufficient inventory: receive order, check inventory, cancel order, and then close order.

**Case 5:**
- Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
- Violation: The violation in this case is similar to Case 2. After checking inventory, the process skips packaging and goes directly to shipping, which should only occur after items have been properly packaged. Therefore, "Ship order" happening before "Package items" violates the normative process.

**Summary:**
Violations occur in Cases 2, 3, and 5:
- Case 2 violates by authorizing payment before packaging.
- Case 3 violates by authorizing payment after canceling an order and shipping after canceling.
- Case 5 violates by shipping items without packaging them first.

Final Answer: The final answer is that Cases 2, 3, and 5 violate the normative process as described. I hope it is correct.
