Step-by-Step Analysis of the Event Log
Step 1: Calculate the Total Resolution Time for Each Ticket
First, we need to determine the total resolution time for each ticket by finding the difference between the timestamp of the "Close Ticket" activity and the timestamp of the "Receive Ticket" activity.

Case 101:

Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:00
Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 10:15
Total Resolution Time: 2 hours 15 minutes
Case 102:

Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05
Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:15
Total Resolution Time: 1 day 1 hour 10 minutes
Case 103:

Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:10
Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:30
Total Resolution Time: 1 hour 20 minutes
Case 104:

Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:20
Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:30
Total Resolution Time: 1 day 0 hours 10 minutes
Case 105:

Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:25
Close Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:30
Total Resolution Time: 2 days 1 hour 5 minutes
Step 2: Determine What Constitutes a "Significantly Longer" Resolution Time
To determine what constitutes a significantly longer resolution time, we can calculate the average resolution time and then identify any tickets that take more than one standard deviation above the mean.

First, convert the total resolution times into minutes:

Case 101: 2 hours 15 minutes = 135 minutes
Case 102: 1 day 1 hour 10 minutes = 1440 + 70 = 1510 minutes
Case 103: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
Case 104: 1 day 0 hours 10 minutes = 1440 + 10 = 1450 minutes
Case 105: 2 days 1 hour 5 minutes = 2880 + 65 = 2945 minutes
Calculate the average resolution time:

 minutes
1224+1061.65=2285.65 minutes

Tickets with resolution times significantly longer than the average (more than 2285.65 minutes) are:

Case 105: 2945 minutes
Tickets with resolution times longer than 1 day (1440 minutes) but less than 2285.65 minutes are:

Case 102: 1510 minutes
Case 104: 1450 minutes
Step 3: Analyze the Tickets with Longer Resolution Times
Let's analyze the tickets with longer resolution times to identify patterns or factors causing delays.

Case 102:
Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05
Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:30 (25 minutes after receipt)
Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:00 (30 minutes after triage)
Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 2024-03-01 11:30 (2.5 hours after assignment)
Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 14:00 (2.5 hours after escalation)
Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:00 (17 hours after investigation)
Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:15 (15 minutes after resolution)
Potential Delays:

Long time between assignment to Level-1 Agent and escalation: 2.5 hours
Long time between escalation and investigation: 2.5 hours
Long time between investigation and resolution: 17 hours
Case 104:
Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:20
Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:00 (40 minutes after receipt)
Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:30 (30 minutes after triage)
Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 13:00 (3.5 hours after assignment)
Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:00 (17.5 hours after investigation)
Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:30 (30 minutes after resolution)
Potential Delays:

Long time between assignment to Level-1 Agent and investigation: 3.5 hours
Long time between investigation and resolution: 17.5 hours
Case 105:
Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:25
Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:35 (10 minutes after receipt)
Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:00 (25 minutes after triage)
Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 09:10 (10 minutes after assignment)
Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 2024-03-01 10:00 (50 minutes after investigation)
Investigate Issue: 2024-03-02 14:00 (1 day 4 hours after escalation)
Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:00 (1 day 19 hours after last investigation)
Close Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:30 (30 minutes after resolution)
Potential Delays:

Long time between escalation and further investigation: 1 day 4 hours
Long time between investigation and resolution: 1 day 19 hours
Step 4: Identify Root Causes and Propose Recommendations
From the analysis, the following factors are contributing to the longer resolution times:

Escalation Delays:

Case 102: Long time between escalation and investigation (2.5 hours).
Case 105: Long time between escalation and further investigation (1 day 4 hours).
Investigation and Resolution Delays:

Case 102: Long time between investigation and resolution (17 hours).
Case 104: Long time between investigation and resolution (17.5 hours).
Case 105: Long time between investigation and resolution (1 day 19 hours).
Assignment Delays:

Case 102: Long time between assignment to Level-1 Agent and escalation (2.5 hours).
Case 104: Long time between assignment to Level-1 Agent and investigation (3.5 hours).
Recommendations to Address Performance Bottlenecks
Improve Escalation Process:

Smooth Handover: Ensure that there is a smooth handover process when tickets are escalated to Level-2 agents.
Timely Notifications: Provide Level-2 agents with timely notifications about escalated tickets to reduce waiting times.
Dedicated Resources: Consider having dedicated Level-2 agents available during peak times to handle escalated tickets more quickly.
Increase Resources for Level-2 Team:

Additional Agents: If the Level-2 team is consistently backed up, consider increasing the number of agents or specialists in that team.
Prioritization: Implement a system to prioritize escalated tickets based on severity or impact to reduce waiting times.
Optimize Investigation and Resolution Steps:

Efficiency Tools: Investigate why there are long delays between investigation and resolution, even in non-escalated cases.
Training and Tools: Provide Level-1 agents with more tools or training to resolve issues more efficiently, reducing the need for escalations.
Resource Access: Ensure that agents have access to necessary resources and information to resolve tickets promptly.
Implement Time Limits for Each Step:

Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Set SLAs for each activity, such as maximum allowable time between assignment and investigation start, or between investigation and resolution.
Compliance Monitoring: Monitor compliance with these SLAs and address any consistently missed targets.
Regularly Review and Analyze Ticket Resolution Times:

Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor ticket resolution times to identify any emerging trends or issues.
Process Mining: Use process mining or other analytical tools to visualize and understand the flow of tickets through the support process.
Enhance Communication and Coordination:

Collaboration: Improve communication between Level-1 and Level-2 agents to ensure a smoother transition during escalations.
Shared Goals: Foster a culture of collaboration and shared goals between different levels of support agents.
By addressing these areas, the customer support team can work towards reducing resolution times and improving overall performance.
