## Process Mining-Driven Optimization of Resource Assignment at TechSolve Solutions

Our goal is to transform TechSolve's resource assignment from a suspected point of inefficiency into a strategic advantage, leveraging the rich data within the incident management event log.

### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

This phase focuses on understanding the "as-is" state of resource utilization and interactions.

**A. Performance and Behavior of Individual Agents and Support Tiers:**

Using the event log, we will extract and analyze the following metrics for individual agents and aggregated by tier (L1, L2, L3):

*   **Workload Distribution:**
    *   *Metric:* Number of unique cases handled, total active time spent on tickets, number of concurrent cases handled over time.
    *   *Analysis:* Identify overloaded or underutilized agents/tiers. Visualize distribution using histograms or box plots.
*   **Activity Processing Times:**
    *   *Metric:* Average, median, and distribution of time spent per activity (e.g., `Work L1 Start` to `Work L1 End`, `Work L2 Start` to `Work L2 End`) per agent and tier.
    *   *Analysis:* Identify agents/tiers that are particularly fast or slow for specific types of work. This helps understand efficiency and potential training needs.
*   **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1:**
    *   *Metric:* Percentage of tickets created and assigned to L1 that are resolved by L1 without escalation.
    *   *Analysis:* Crucial for L1 effectiveness. Low FCR might indicate issues with L1 skills, empowerment, or ticket complexity misjudgment.
*   **Frequency of Handling Specific Ticket Types/Skills:**
    *   *Metric:* Count and proportion of tickets handled by each agent/tier, broken down by `Ticket Category` and `Required Skill`.
    *   *Analysis:* Understand specialization and how well current assignments align with it. Are L1 agents attempting complex tasks? Are specialists handling trivial ones?
*   **Ticket "Ping-Pong" & Reassignment Frequency:**
    *   *Metric:* Number of reassignments per ticket, number of times a ticket revisits the same agent or tier after being passed on.
    *   *Analysis:* Highlights inefficiency and rework.

**B. Actual Assignment Patterns, Escalations, and Reassignments:**

Process mining techniques will be crucial here:

*   **Process Discovery (Automated Process Map Generation):**
    *   *Technique:* Generate a process map focusing on activities like `Assign L1`, `Assign L2`, `Assign L3`, `Escalate L2`, `Escalate L3`, `Reassign`. The map will visually show the actual paths tickets take, including frequencies and bottlenecks.
    *   *Comparison:* This "as-is" discovered process map can be directly compared to TechSolve's documented, intended assignment logic (e.g., L1 round-robin, then skill-based escalation). Deviations will be immediately apparent.
*   **Resource Interaction Analysis (Social Network Analysis):**
    *   *Technique:* Construct a social network where agents are nodes and handovers (assignments, escalations, reassignments) are edges. The thickness/color of edges can represent frequency or duration.
    *   *Revelation:* This reveals key "connectors," isolated agents, common handover paths, and "bottleneck" resources who receive many tickets or from whom many tickets are escalated. It can also show if escalations consistently go to specific L2/L3 agents regardless of documented skill matching.
*   **Role Discovery:**
    *   *Technique:* Cluster agents based on their activity profiles (which activities they perform most frequently).
    *   *Revelation:* This can uncover *de facto* roles that may not align with official tiers or skill documentation. For example, certain L1 agents might be unofficially specializing in certain categories, or L2s might be acting more like L1s.
*   **Variant Analysis:**
    *   *Technique:* Identify common and rare process variants related to assignments.
    *   *Revelation:* Show dominant paths for escalations (e.g., L1 -> L2 specific team -> L3 specific expert) versus less common, perhaps more problematic, paths.

**C. Utilization of Specific Skills:**

*   **Skill Mismatch Analysis:**
    *   *Technique:* For each activity where an agent works on a ticket (e.g., `Work L1 Start`, `Work L2 Start`), compare the agent's `Agent Skills` with the `Ticket Required Skill`.
    *   *Analysis:*
        *   Quantify instances where the assigned agent *lacks* the `Required Skill`.
        *   Quantify instances where highly skilled agents (e.g., L2/L3 with `Networking-Firewall`) are assigned tickets with a `Required Skill` that L1 could handle (e.g., `Basic-Troubleshoot` or even a more general skill the L1 possesses).
        *   Identify "hot" skills (high demand, low supply) and "cold" skills (low demand, potentially oversupply).
*   **Specialist Workload Breakdown:**
    *   *Technique:* Filter the event log for L2/L3 agents. Analyze the `Required Skill` of tickets they handle.
    *   *Analysis:* Calculate the percentage of time specialists spend on tasks matching their core, advanced skills versus tasks that are simpler or could be handled by L1 or less specialized L2 agents.

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Based on the analysis in step 1, we can pinpoint:

*   **Skill-Based Bottlenecks:**
    *   *Identification:* Long waiting times (time between `Assign Lx` and `Work Lx Start`) for tickets with specific `Required Skill`. Correlate this with the number of available agents possessing that skill.
    *   *Quantification:* Average waiting time for tickets requiring skill X when agent pool for skill X is Y.
*   **Delays from Reassignments/Escalations:**
    *   *Identification:* Process map highlighting frequent loops or back-and-forth handovers. Social network analysis showing tickets bouncing between agents.
    *   *Quantification:* Average time added to ticket lifecycle per reassignment/escalation. Percentage of tickets exceeding a certain number of reassignments.
*   **Impact of Incorrect Initial Assignments:**
    *   *Identification:* High FCR failure at L1, quick escalations from L1 to L2 (short `Work L1 Start` to `Work L1 End` followed by `Escalate L2`). Tickets where `Required Skill` changes shortly after initial assignment.
    *   *Quantification:* Percentage of L1 assignments escalated within X minutes. Correlation between initial `Ticket Category` / `Required Skill` and likelihood of reassignment.
*   **Underperforming/Overloaded Agents/Teams:**
    *   *Identification:* Workload distribution charts (from 1A) showing significant disparities. Agents with consistently long processing times for similar tasks.
    *   *Quantification:* Standard deviation of workload across agents. List of top 5 overloaded and underutilized agents.
*   **Correlation between Assignment Patterns and SLA Breaches:**
    *   *Identification:* Using conformance checking or variant analysis, compare cases that breached SLAs vs. those that met them.
    *   *Analysis:* Do breached tickets have more reassignments? Are they more likely to involve skill mismatches? Do they wait longer for specific skilled resources?
    *   *Quantification:* Percentage of SLA breaches linked to >N reassignments. Percentage of SLA breaches where assigned agent lacked the `Required Skill`. Average delay contributed by assignment issues in breached tickets.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Digging deeper into *why* these issues occur:

*   **Deficiencies in Current Assignment Rules:**
    *   *Evidence:* If analysis shows round-robin is strictly followed even when a skilled agent is idle and a ticket requiring their skill is waiting, or if L1 escalates to L2 round-robin pool instead of a specific L2 skilled agent.
*   **Inaccurate/Incomplete Agent Skill Profiles:**
    *   *Evidence:* Frequent reassignments with `Notes` indicating "Needs different skill" *after* an agent has been assigned based on their documented skills.
*   **Poor Initial Ticket Categorization or Skill Requirement Identification:**
    *   *Evidence:* `Ticket Category` or `Required Skill` changing frequently after initial creation or L1 assessment. High number of reassignments where the `Required Skill` column is updated.
*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility into Agent Workload and Availability:**
    *   *Evidence:* Round-robin assigning to an already overloaded agent while another is idle. This is harder to directly mine but can be inferred if workload imbalances persist despite available capacity.
*   **Insufficient Training or Empowerment of L1 Agents:**
    *   *Evidence:* High L1 escalation rates for tickets with `Required Skill` that L1 agents *should* possess or could be trained for. Short L1 handling times before escalation for common issues.
*   **Process Mining for Root Cause Identification:**
    *   **Variant Analysis:** Compare the "happy path" (e.g., L1 resolution or direct L1 to skilled L2 assignment and resolution) with problematic variants (multiple reassignments, long delays). Isolate the differences in ticket attributes, initial assignment choices, or agent characteristics that distinguish these paths.
    *   **Decision Mining (using Decision Tree Classifiers):**
        *   Model key decision points like "L1: Resolve or Escalate?" or "Dispatcher: Assign to Agent X or Agent Y?".
        *   Inputs: Ticket attributes (Priority, Category, Required Skill), current agent workload (if inferable), agent skills.
        *   Output: The actual decision made (e.g., escalated, assigned to Agent A).
        *   *Analysis:* Understand which factors *actually* drive these decisions. For instance, are escalations primarily driven by `Required Skill`, or does `Ticket Category` play a bigger role than it should? Are P2/P3 tickets disproportionately escalated even if L1 has the skill, perhaps due to perceived pressure? This helps uncover flawed decision logic.

### 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

Here are three distinct, data-driven strategies:

**Strategy 1: Intelligent Skill-Based & Proficiency-Weighted Routing**

*   **Issue Addressed:** Skill mismatches, specialists handling low-skill tasks, inefficient escalations.
*   **PM Insights Leveraged:**
    *   Identification of common `Required Skill` for different `Ticket Category` and `Priority`.
    *   Analysis of `Agent Skills` effectiveness (which skills lead to faster resolution by which agents).
    *   Quantification of delays due to skill-mismatched assignments.
*   **Data Required:**
    *   Accurate and up-to-date `Agent Skills` (ideally with proficiency levels: e.g., Basic, Intermediate, Expert).
    *   Reliable `Required Skill` for each ticket (potentially enhanced by Natural Language Processing on ticket descriptions if `Required Skill` is often inaccurate).
    *   Real-time agent availability.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  When a ticket needs assignment (new or escalated), the system identifies the `Required Skill`.
    2.  It then searches for available agents in the appropriate tier (or the next tier for escalations) who possess that skill.
    3.  If multiple agents are available, it prioritizes based on:
        *   Proficiency level in the required skill (expert preferred).
        *   Current workload (to balance load).
        *   Avoid assigning overqualified specialists to basic tasks if less-skilled but capable agents are available.
*   **Expected Benefits:**
    *   Reduced reassignments due to skill mismatch (-20-30%).
    *   Faster resolution times by matching tickets to the best-suited agent more quickly (+10-15% throughput for skilled tasks).
    *   Improved utilization of specialist skills (specialists focus on complex issues).
    *   Better L1 FCR if L1s are assigned tasks they are truly skilled for.

**Strategy 2: Workload-Aware & SLA-Conscious Dynamic Assignment**

*   **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution, SLA breaches due to overloaded key resources, delays caused by queues.
*   **PM Insights Leveraged:**
    *   Agent workload patterns and processing times (from 1A).
    *   Identification of bottleneck resources and queues (from 1B and 2A).
    *   Correlation of workload/queue times with SLA breaches (from 2E).
*   **Data Required:**
    *   Real-time agent status (Available, Busy, On Break).
    *   Current number of active tickets per agent.
    *   Estimated effort/handling time per ticket type/priority (derived from historical PM data).
    *   SLA target for each ticket.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  Integrates with Strategy 1 (skill matching is primary).
    2.  Among skill-matched available agents, the system calculates a "capacity score" based on:
        *   Current number of assigned tickets.
        *   Sum of estimated remaining work on their current tickets.
        *   Proximity of their currently assigned tickets to their SLA deadlines.
    3.  Assigns the new ticket to the skill-matched agent with the best capacity score (i.e., most available to handle it promptly without jeopardizing other SLAs).
    4.  For P1/P2 tickets nearing SLA, the system could even flag the need to potentially interrupt a less critical task if no suitable agent is immediately free.
*   **Expected Benefits:**
    *   More balanced workload across agents.
    *   Reduced waiting times in queues (-15-25%).
    *   Improved SLA compliance, especially for P2/P3 tickets, by prioritizing assignment to agents who can act quickly (+10-20% SLA adherence).
    *   Reduced agent burnout.

**Strategy 3: Predictive L1 Escalation Guidance & Proactive L2/L3 Alerting**

*   **Issue Addressed:** Unnecessary L1 escalations, delays in engaging L2/L3 when genuinely needed, L1s spending too much time on tickets they will inevitably escalate.
*   **PM Insights Leveraged:**
    *   Characteristics of tickets successfully resolved by L1 vs. those consistently escalated (from variant analysis and decision mining on L1 resolution/escalation).
    *   L1 FCR rates for different `Ticket Category`/`Required Skill` combinations.
    *   Typical L1 handling time before escalation for complex issues.
*   **Data Required:**
    *   Historical data on ticket attributes, L1 handling time, `Agent Skills` of L1, and resolution path (L1 resolved vs. escalated to L2/L3).
    *   Keywords from ticket descriptions.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  **L1 Escalation Prediction:** When an L1 agent picks up a new ticket, a predictive model (trained on historical data) provides a "probability of L1 resolution" score and highlights key factors (e.g., "Tickets with 'firewall access request' in description and 'Network' category are resolved by L1 only 15% of the time").
    2.  **Guided Escalation:** If probability is low (e.g., <20%), the system can suggest immediate escalation or a very short time-boxed L1 attempt. It can also pre-suggest the most likely L2 skill/team based on the ticket profile.
    3.  **Proactive L2/L3 Alerting:** For tickets with a very high probability of needing L2/L3 (e.g., specific P1/P2 categories with known complex `Required Skill`), the system could flag these to the relevant L2/L3 queue or team lead even while L1 does initial triage, allowing them to anticipate and prepare.
*   **Expected Benefits:**
    *   Increased L1 FCR for appropriate tickets (L1s focus where they can succeed).
    *   Reduced time wasted by L1 on unresolvable issues.
    *   Faster engagement of L2/L3 specialists for complex tickets, reducing overall resolution time for these (-10-15% for complex tickets).
    *   More empowered L1 agents with clearer guidance.

### 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

**A. Business Process Simulation:**

*   **Purpose:** To test and compare the proposed assignment strategies in a virtual environment before committing to full-scale implementation, minimizing risk and allowing for refinement.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  **Baseline Model:** Use the "as-is" process model discovered through process mining (including arrival rates, activity durations, resource availability, existing assignment logic) as the baseline in a simulation tool. Validate this model against historical KPIs.
    2.  **"To-Be" Models:** Create new simulation models by altering the resource assignment logic according to each of the three proposed strategies (or combinations). Input the same historical ticket arrival patterns.
    3.  **Comparison:** Run simulations and compare KPIs like:
        *   Average ticket resolution time (overall and by Priority/Category).
        *   SLA compliance rates (P1, P2, P3, P4).
        *   Resource utilization rates (per agent, per tier).
        *   Number of reassignments and escalations.
        *   Queue lengths and waiting times for specific skills/tiers.
    *   This allows quantifying the potential impact (e.g., "Strategy 1 is projected to reduce P2 SLA breaches by 12%").

**B. Implementation and Monitoring:**

*   **Phased Rollout:** Implement the chosen strategy (or a hybrid) in a phased manner, perhaps starting with a specific ticket category or support team to manage change and gather early feedback.
*   **Continuous Monitoring with Process Mining Dashboards:**
    *   **Purpose:** Track the ongoing effectiveness of the new strategies, identify any unintended consequences, and enable continuous improvement.
    *   **Key Resource-Related KPIs to Track:**
        *   **SLA Compliance:** Overall and specifically for P2/P3 tickets.
        *   **Reassignment Rate:** Number of reassignments per ticket; reassignments within/between tiers.
        *   **First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate:** For L1.
        *   **Skill Utilization Rate:** Percentage of time agents work on tickets matching their primary skills; instances of over/under-qualification for assigned tasks.
        *   **Agent Workload Balance:** Distribution of active tickets and total work time across agents.
        *   **Queue Times:** Average waiting time for assignment at each tier and for specific skills.
        *   **Processing Times:** Average time agents spend actively working on tickets.
        *   **End-to-End Resolution Time:** Overall and by priority/category.
    *   **Process Views for Dashboards:**
        *   **Updated Process Map:** Visualizing the new flow, highlighting adherence to new assignment rules.
        *   **Resource Performance Dashboard:** Showing individual and team KPIs (workload, throughput, processing times).
        *   **SLA Conformance Dashboard:** Tracking compliance and highlighting cases at risk.
        *   **Skill Demand vs. Supply Dashboard:** Monitoring if skill gaps are emerging or being addressed.
        *   **Bottleneck Analysis View:** Continuously checking for new or persistent bottlenecks in the assignment or resolution phases.

By adopting this systematic, data-driven approach, TechSolve Solutions can move beyond anecdotal evidence and hunches to make informed decisions that optimize their resource assignment, leading to improved efficiency, better SLA performance, and higher satisfaction for both customers and support agents.
