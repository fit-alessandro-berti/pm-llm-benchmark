# Process Mining Event Log

**Assumptions Made:**
- **Case ID**: `order_id` as the primary case identifier.
- **Picking Events**: Created **one "Items Picked" event per order** using the **earliest `item_picking_date`** for that order (represents when picking started/completed for the order).
- **Delivery Events**: Created **separate "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events for each delivery record** (allows split shipments to be visible).
- **Invoice Events**: One "Invoice Issued" event per invoice record.
- **Payment Events**: One "Payment Received" event per payment record.
- **Resources**: Mapped using the Resources Table where available.
- **Chronological Order**: Events sorted by `Timestamp` within each `order_id`.
- **Missing Data**: Order 1004 has no delivery/invoice/payment records.
