### High-Level Process Steps for Manufacturing Event Log

---

#### **1. Material Preparation**
**Included Low-Level Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
These events represent the initial phase of the process where raw materials are retrieved, identified, positioned, and prepared for further processing. They are temporally close, involve setup activities, and are logically grouped as the foundational step before any actual manufacturing (like welding) begins.

**Name Justification:**
This name reflects the purpose of this step: preparing the material for subsequent operations.

---

#### **2. Assembly / Welding**
**Included Low-Level Events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
These events are sequential actions that form a coherent task — assembling or joining parts via welding. The use of a specific tool and execution of welds indicates a distinct phase focused on component construction.

**Name Justification:**
"Welding" captures the core action, while "Assembly" provides broader context in case other joining methods are used in variations of the process.

---

#### **3. Quality Inspection (Automated & Manual)**
**Included Low-Level Events:**
- Measure weld integrity
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
These two checks occur after the main fabrication steps and are aimed at evaluating whether the product meets quality standards. One is performed by an automated sensor; the other by a human operator, but both serve the same functional purpose.

**Name Justification:**
Reflects the intent to inspect and validate product quality through different means.

---

#### **4. Post-Processing / Finishing**
**Included Low-Level Events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:**
These steps occur after quality checks and involve applying a finish to the product to protect or enhance it. The drying step is directly dependent on the coating application, indicating a tightly coupled sub-process.

**Name Justification:**
“Post-processing” or “Finishing” indicates the final stages of production where the product is readied for shipment or next use.

### Conclusion

By grouping events based on:
- **Temporal proximity**
- **Functional similarity**
- **Resource type or role**
- **Logical sequence in the workflow**

We can abstract the detailed event log into a more interpretable and analyzable representation of the overall manufacturing process. This abstraction supports process mining, performance analysis, bottleneck identification, and compliance checking.
