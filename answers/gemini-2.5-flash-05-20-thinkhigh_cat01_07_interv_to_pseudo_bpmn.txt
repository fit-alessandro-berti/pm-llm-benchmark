**Notes/Ambiguities/Clarifications:**

*   **Note 1 (Missing PO from Dan's side):** When Dan informs Mary about a missing PO, Mary's process would logically loop back to her initial "Check for Valid PO Number" task, as she is responsible for obtaining it.
*   **Note 2 (Other Discrepancy from Dan's side, unresolvable by Purchasing):** When Dan asks Mary to hold and clarify, it means the invoice has an issue that Mary needs to address. She will then perform her "Match Invoice Line Items against PO in System" task, which will likely lead her down the "No Match (Discrepancy)" path, triggering her own "Email Purchasing Team to Clarify" or "Escalate Invoice to AP Supervisor." This reflects Mary's central coordination role.
*   **Note 3 (Manager Rejection):** Carlos's rejection for "suspicious" items or "big differences" implies a significant issue beyond routine clarification. This is best routed directly to the Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) for their exception handling process, as stated by Rita, "I mostly come into play when there are exceptions."
*   **System Role:** The "System" is explicitly modeled as a pool for automated tasks (sending notifications, processing approvals) and is implicitly involved in tasks like "Log Invoice into Accounting System" or "Approve Invoice in System."
*   **Supplier Interactions:** The model illustrates various paths for supplier interaction, reflecting different roles initiating contact (AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, AP Supervisor, Supplier Relationship Manager) depending on the nature and stage of the issue.
*   **Rework Loops:** Explicit loops back to prior steps (e.g., after supplier sends corrected invoice, after clarification from purchasing) indicate necessary rework within the process.
