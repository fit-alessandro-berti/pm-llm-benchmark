Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies, I've identified some key differences between the protected and unprotected groups. Please note that these differences are based on the provided data and may not be exhaustive or definitive.

**1. Registration point:** The protected group has a more balanced registration point between "ER" (Emergency Room) and "FD" ( possibly First Diagnosis or First Department), whereas the unprotected group has a higher frequency of registration at "FD".

**2. Examination and diagnosis:** The unprotected group has a higher frequency of "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination" compared to the protected group. This might indicate that the unprotected group requires more detailed or specialized examinations.

**3. Treatment success and discharge:** Both groups have similar frequencies of "Treatment successful" and "Discharge", but the unprotected group has a higher frequency of "Treatment unsuccessful" and subsequent re-diagnosis and re-treatment. This could suggest that the unprotected group faces more challenges in achieving successful treatment outcomes.

**4. Performance metrics:** The performance metrics (e.g., execution time) seem to be similar between the two groups, with some variants having slightly higher or lower values.

**5. Variant complexity:** The unprotected group has more complex variants, with more activities and higher frequencies of re-diagnosis and re-treatment. This might indicate that the unprotected group requires more resources or attention.

**6. UnCompleted or Missing Processes:** In the unprotected group there are process variant like: Discharge, Thorough Examination, and Diagnosis. This could indicate that there are missing data in the unprotected group.

The observed differences might be due to various factors, such as:
- Different demographics or characteristics between the protected and unprotected groups
- Variations in healthcare policies or treatment protocols
- Differences in resource allocation or availability
- Potential biases in data collection or recording
Further analysis and investigation would be necessary to determine the root causes of these differences and their implications. 

Please note that this analysis is based on a limited view of the data, and more insights might be gained by exploring additional aspects of the process variants, such as patient outcomes, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness. 

Also, this analysis was made considering that the provided data reflect some knowledge about healthcare process, this might not be the case if other processes or domain is being analyzed.
