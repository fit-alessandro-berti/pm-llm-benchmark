# **Comprehensive Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Operations**

---

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

### **1.1 Data Integration and Preprocessing**

To perform process mining, the first step is to **integrate and preprocess** the data from multiple sources into a **cohesive event log**. This involves:

- **Data Cleaning and Normalization:**
  - Aligning timestamps across all systems to a common timezone and format.
  - Resolving duplicate or conflicting events (e.g., multiple GPS points for the same vehicle at the same time).
  - Mapping GPS coordinates to meaningful locations (e.g., depot, customer addresses, traffic zones) using geocoding or predefined lookup tables.
  - Filling in missing fields (e.g., missing package IDs in vehicle GPS events) using contextual inference or flagging for review.

- **Event Log Construction:**
  - Creating a unified event log with a **Case ID** (e.g., `Vehicle-Day`) to group events by vehicle per day.
  - Including **Activity/Status** (e.g., 'Arrive Customer', 'Delivery Failed', 'Unscheduled Stop') as process activities.
  - Mapping **resources** (e.g., Driver ID, Vehicle ID) and **objects** (e.g., Package ID) to enable resource and object-centric analysis.

- **Challenges:**
  - **Data Gaps:** Missing timestamps or GPS data can create incomplete process flows.
  - **Event Overlap:** Events from different systems may occur simultaneously, requiring temporal resolution.
  - **Data Granularity:** GPS data is high-frequency, while scanner events are sparse; alignment is critical for accurate process modeling.
  - **Event Typology:** Distinguishing between **vehicle-level** and **package-level** events is essential for modeling both fleet and customer delivery processes.

### **1.2 Process Discovery Algorithms**

Using **process discovery algorithms** (e.g., **Alpha Miner**, **Heuristic Miner**, **Inductive Miner**), we can visualize the **actual delivery process** from depot departure to depot return, including:

- **Delivery Sequence:** The order of customer stops and delivery outcomes.
- **Unplanned Stops:** Such as traffic delays, maintenance stops, or failed delivery attempts.
- **Vehicle Behavior:** Idle times, speed variations, and route deviations.

These models will provide a **process map** that reflects the **real-world execution** of the delivery process, including:

- **Variants:** Different delivery sequences and deviations from the planned route.
- **Loops and Repeats:** Re-delivery attempts or repeated customer visits.
- **Resource Usage:** How drivers and vehicles are utilized over time.

### **1.3 Conformance Checking Against Planned Routes**

To compare the **actual process** with the **planned process**, we will use **conformance checking techniques** such as:

- **Fitness Metrics:** Measures how well the actual process adheres to the planned route (e.g., using **Token-based Conformance Checking**).
- **Deviation Detection:** Identifying:
  - **Sequence deviations** (e.g., visiting a customer before the planned time).
  - **Unplanned stops** (e.g., unscheduled maintenance, traffic delays).
  - **Missed deliveries** or **re-delivery attempts**.
  - **Timing discrepancies** (e.g., significant delays at a customer stop).

By aligning the **dispatch system’s planned route** (as a reference process model) with the **actual event log**, we can identify **where and why** the delivery process deviates from the plan.

## **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

### **2.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

To evaluate operational efficiency, we define the following **KPIs** based on the event log:

| KPI Name | Description | Calculation |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | % of deliveries completed within customer-specified time windows | (Number of on-time deliveries) / (Total deliveries) |
| **Average Time per Delivery Stop** | Avg time spent per customer stop (from 'Arrive Customer' to 'Depart Customer') | Sum of stop durations / Total stops |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio** | Ratio of travel time to total delivery time | (Sum of travel time) / (Sum of total delivery time) |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/package** | Fuel used per kilometer per package delivered | (Total fuel used) / (Total km driven * Total packages delivered) |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | % of time a vehicle is actively working (excluding idle time) | (Active time) / (Total shift time) |
| **Traffic Delay Frequency** | Avg number of traffic-related delays per route | Count of 'Low Speed Detected' events per route |
| **Rate of Failed Deliveries** | % of deliveries that were attempted but failed | (Number of failed deliveries) / (Total deliveries) |

### **2.2 Bottleneck Identification Techniques**

Using **process mining techniques**, we can identify bottlenecks in the delivery process:

- **Time Analysis (e.g., TimeGraph, Time Petri Net):**
  - Identify **activities with high dwell times** (e.g., long customer interaction times, repeated attempts).
  - Highlight **traffic hotspots** by correlating GPS speed data with event logs.

- **Resource Analysis (e.g., Resource Profile, Resource-Centric Process Mining):**
  - Compare **driver performance** (e.g., delivery rate, time per stop) to identify skill gaps or inefficiencies.
  - Analyze **vehicle performance** (e.g., fuel efficiency, frequency of breakdowns).

- **Variants Analysis (e.g., Process Tree Mining, Variant Analysis):**
  - Compare **high-performing vs. low-performing routes** to identify optimal delivery sequences.
  - Identify **common deviations** (e.g., frequent re-deliveries, traffic-induced delays).

- **Dwell Time Analysis:**
  - Quantify the **time spent at customer locations** (from 'Arrive Customer' to 'Depart Customer') to identify delays due to:
    - Customer unavailability.
    - Driver inefficiencies.
    - Poor parking availability.

These analyses will help quantify the **impact of bottlenecks** on KPIs like on-time delivery rate and fuel efficiency.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

### **3.1 Potential Root Causes**

Beyond identifying **where** inefficiencies occur, we investigate the **why** behind them:

- **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
  - Static routes may not account for real-time traffic or customer availability, leading to **delays and re-routes**.

- **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
  - Overly optimistic estimates in the dispatch system can cause **delays** and **missed time windows**.

- **Traffic Congestion:**
  - Repeated **low-speed events** or **unplanned stops** in certain zones indicate **traffic hotspots**.

- **Variability in Service Time:**
  - High variability in **customer interaction time** (e.g., long dwell times, failed deliveries) affects **delivery punctuality**.

- **Vehicle Breakdowns and Maintenance:**
  - Frequent **unscheduled stops** or **engine warnings** may indicate **poor maintenance scheduling** or **vehicle aging**.

- **Driver Behavior:**
  - Variability in **time per stop**, **fuel efficiency**, or **route adherence** may reflect **driver skill or behavior** differences.

- **Failed Delivery Attempts:**
  - High **failed delivery rates** may be due to **inaccurate delivery time windows**, **poor address data**, or **customer unavailability**.

### **3.2 Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Validation**

- **Variant Analysis:**
  - Compare **high-performing vs. low-performing routes** to identify **sequence patterns** that lead to better outcomes.

- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Correlate **GPS speed data** with **event types** to detect **traffic-induced delays**.

- **Dwell Time Analysis:**
  - Analyze **time spent at customer locations** to identify **inefficiencies in service time**.

- **Maintenance Event Correlation:**
  - Cross-reference **maintenance logs** with **vehicle GPS data** to identify **patterns of breakdowns** and **impact on delivery performance**.

These techniques will help **validate root causes** and **quantify their impact** on KPIs like on-time delivery rate and fuel consumption.

## **5. Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring**

### **5.1 Accounting for Operational Constraints**

Each proposed strategy must consider:
