To identify the root causes for performance issues in the process, we need to consider the frequency and performance data for each process variant. Here are some key observations:

1. **High-Frequency Variants with High Performance:**
   - Variant consuming 810187.903 performance (Admin Approval, Budget Owner Approval, and Supervisory Final Approval).
   - Variant consuming 1084338.407 performance (Admin Approval, Budget Owner Approval, and Supervisory Final Approval).
   - Variant consuming 1604595.638 performance (Rejection, Resubmission, Admin Approval, Supervisory Final Approval).

2. **Identify Variants with Very High Performance:**
   - Variant consuming 9110508.000 performance (Admin Approval, Supervisory Final Approval, Payment Handling).
   - Variant consuming 13805869.200 performance (Admin Rejection, Payment Handling).

3. **Common Issues:**
   - **Rejection and Resubmission:** Variants involving multiple rejections and resubmissions (e.g., multiple rejections by Administration, Budget Owner, or Supervisors) tend to have high performance. This is likely due to the overhead of repeated rejections and reprocessing.
   - **Highly Frequent and Low Performance Variants:** Variants that are relatively frequent but have low performance (e.g., Declaration Saved) could indicate issues such as errors in the system or unnecessary steps.

4. **Variants with Both High Frequency and Performance:**
   - Variants where both frequency and performance are high (e.g., Admin Approval, Budget Owner Approval, and Supervisory Final Approval) may still have underlying inefficiencies that need to be optimized.
   - Variants with high frequency and performance (e.g., uploaded case with high pre-approval and final approval without rejections) might need to be more deeply analyzed to understand why they have such high performance.

### Root Causes for High Performance Issues

1. **Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions:**
   - Frequent rejections and re-submissions (variants consuming 1604595.638, 2061236.516) suggest that there are processes or decisions that are being challenged multiple times, leading to higher performance overhead.
   - Example: Rejection by Administration, Rejection by Employee, Re-submission, and then multiple approvals leading to payment.

2. **High Frequencies with High Performance:**
   - Variants consuming 9110508.000, 13805869.200, etc., indicate high performance but also high frequency. This suggests issues such as:
     - System inefficiencies or bottlenecks in payment handling.
     - Frequent administrative tasks that aren't streamlined.
     - Potential system errors or delays in final stages.

3. **Complex Decision Paths:**
   - Variants with complex paths (e.g., multiple approvals and rejections) are taking a lot of time, which could be due to:
     - Manual interventions that are time-consuming.
     - Inefficiencies in decision-making or approval workflows.
     - System delays due to complex logic.

### Recommendations

1. **Optimize Approvals and Rejections:**
   - Simplify the approval paths to reduce the number of rejections and resubmissions. Consider automating some approvals where appropriate.
   
2. **Streamline Payment Handling:**
   - Review the payment handling process to identify bottlenecks and optimize it. Ensure that payment processing can keep up with high performance requirements.

3. **Improve System Efficiency:**
   - Investigate system inefficiencies and delays, especially where high performance is achieved. Look for opportunities to speed up automated processes.

4. **Bias Towards Simpler Approvals:**
   - Encourage the most straightforward workflow (Admin and Supervisory Final Approval) to reduce the complexity and overhead.

By addressing these specific areas, you can reduce the performance penalties and streamline the process.
