```sql
SELECT
  el.*
FROM
  event_log AS el
WHERE
  el.case_id IN (
    SELECT
      case_id
    FROM
      event_log
    GROUP BY
      case_id
    HAVING
      COUNT(*) <= 6
  );
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Outer Query:** `SELECT el.* FROM event_log AS el` - This selects all columns from the `event_log` table, aliased as `el`.

2. **`WHERE el.case_id IN (...)`:** This filters the events based on whether their `case_id` is present in the result of the subquery.

3. **Subquery:** `SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` - This is the core logic:
   - `SELECT case_id`:  Selects the `case_id`.
   - `FROM event_log`: Specifies the table.
   - `GROUP BY case_id`: Groups the rows by `case_id`, so we can count events for each case.
   - `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`:  This is the crucial filtering step.  `COUNT(*)` counts the number of events within each `case_id` group.  The `HAVING` clause filters these groups, keeping only those where the count is less than or equal to 6.

**How it works:**

The subquery first identifies all `case_id` values that have 6 or fewer events.  Then, the outer query selects all rows from the `event_log` where the `case_id` matches one of the `case_id` values returned by the subquery.  This effectively filters out cases with more than six events and returns only the events from the remaining cases.

**Why this is a good solution:**

* **Clear and Readable:** The query is relatively easy to understand, with a clear separation of concerns between identifying valid `case_id`s and selecting the corresponding events.
* **Efficient (for DuckDB):** DuckDB is optimized for analytical queries.  Using a subquery with `IN` is generally a good approach for this type of filtering in DuckDB.  DuckDB's query planner can often optimize this pattern effectively.
* **Correctness:**  The query accurately implements the requirements of the prompt.
* **Standard SQL:**  The query uses standard SQL syntax, making it portable to other database systems with minor adjustments if needed.
