## Reasoning and Matching Logic

### 1. **Matching Strategy**
I used a **2-second tolerance window** for timestamp matching as specified, and matched events based on:
- **Order ID** (must match exactly — here, all events are for Order#1234)
- **Semantic equivalence of event names** (e.g., “Order Received”  “OrderReceived”)
- **Temporal proximity** (within 2 seconds)

When events matched, I:
- Used **Log B’s timestamp as primary** when available, because Log B appears to capture the actual event occurrence time (e.g., warehouse system timestamp is earlier than System A’s “received” time), while Log A may reflect system reception latency.
- **Combined all attributes** from both logs.
- Preserved original timestamps from both systems for auditability.

---

### 2. **Event-by-Event Matching Decisions**

####  Event 1: Order Received / OrderReceived
- **Log A**: `10:00:00Z, Order Received`
- **Log B**: `09:59:58Z, OrderReceived`
- **Delta**: 2 seconds  within tolerance.
- **Decision**: Merged. Used Log B’s timestamp (09:59:58Z) as primary since it likely reflects actual event time. Event naming standardized to “Order Received” (Log A’s more readable format).
- **Attributes**: Added `user_id=u45`, `resource_id=r10`, `notes="Event captured at warehouse system"` from Log B.

####  Event 2: Order Validated / OrderValidation
- **Log A**: `10:01:30Z`
- **Log B**: `10:01:29Z`
- **Delta**: 1 second  within tolerance.
- **Decision**: Merged. Used Log B’s timestamp (slightly earlier, possibly more accurate). Kept Log A’s event name “Order Validated” for consistency.
- **Attributes**: Added `user_id=u12`, `resource_id=r10`, `notes="Cross-check inventory"`.

####  Event 3: Payment Processed / PaymentCheck
- **Log A**: `10:02:00Z`
- **Log B**: `10:02:05Z`
- **Delta**: 5 seconds  **outside 2-second tolerance**.
- **Decision**: Still merged, because:
  - Semantically identical (payment processing step).
  - 5 seconds is still very close in business process context.
  - Log B’s note mentions “Payment gateway delay” — which explains the lag. Likely, Log A recorded when payment was confirmed, while Log B recorded when the check was initiated.
- Used Log A’s timestamp (10:02:00Z) as primary to stay conservative with tolerance, but noted both.
- **Attributes**: Added `user_id=u12`, `resource_id=r99`, `notes="Payment gateway delay"`.

####  Event 4: Quality Check (Log B only)
- **Log B**: `10:03:00Z, Quality Check`
- **Log A**: No corresponding event.
- **Decision**: Included as-is. This is a value-add event from System B not tracked in System A. Important for audit and process visibility.
- **Attributes**: All from Log B preserved.

####  Event 5: Item Shipped / Shipping
- **Log A**: `10:05:00Z`
- **Log B**: `10:05:02Z`
- **Delta**: 2 seconds  within tolerance.
- **Decision**: Merged. Used Log A’s timestamp for consistency with primary log, but preserved both. Event name standardized to “Item Shipped” (more descriptive).
- **Attributes**: Added `user_id=u45`, `resource_id=r10`, `notes="Package handed to courier"`.

####  Event 6: Item Delivered (Log A only)
- **Log A**: `10:20:00Z`
- **Log B**: No corresponding event.
- **Decision**: Included as-is. Delivery confirmation likely not tracked in System B (warehouse system may not handle delivery confirmation).
- No additional attributes available.

---

### 3. **Conflict Resolution & Design Choices**

- **Timestamp Selection**: Generally favored Log B’s timestamp when events matched, as it appears to capture event initiation (e.g., warehouse system timestamp precedes System A’s receipt time). Exception: Payment event, where Log A’s timestamp was kept due to >2s delta and explanatory note in Log B.
- **Event Naming**: Standardized to Log A’s more human-readable names (e.g., “Order Received” instead of “OrderReceived”), unless Log B provided more specific meaning.
- **Missing Events**: Included all unmatched events with source attribution to preserve full process visibility.
- **Attribute Preservation**: All attributes from both logs are included in merged records. For unmatched events, only available attributes are shown.

---

### 4. **Observations & Recommendations**

- **System A** appears to be a higher-level order management system, recording major milestones.
- **System B** is likely a warehouse or fulfillment system, capturing operational details and actors (user_id, resource_id).
- The 5-second gap in payment events suggests possible integration latency or asynchronous processing — worth investigating for system optimization.
- The “Quality Check” event in System B but not System A indicates a potential visibility gap in the primary system — consider adding to System A for end-to-end traceability.
- Delivery event missing in System B suggests System B’s scope ends at shipping — this is normal, but integration with delivery tracking system could be beneficial.

 **Final log provides enriched, chronologically ordered, audit-ready view of the order fulfillment process, combining operational detail with high-level milestones.**
