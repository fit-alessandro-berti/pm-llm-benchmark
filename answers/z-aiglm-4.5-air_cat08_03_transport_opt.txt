### Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels

---

#### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

**Data Preprocessing and Integration:**  
- **Challenges:**  
  - **Heterogeneity:** GPS (continuous events), scanners (discrete milestones), dispatch (static plans), and maintenance (irregular events) require alignment.  
  - **Data Quality:** GPS inaccuracies (e.g., location drift), missing scanner events, or misaligned timestamps.  
  - **Granularity:** GPS data points (e.g., every 30 seconds) vs. scanner events (e.g., per delivery).  
  - **Context Linking:** Connecting GPS stops to scanner events (e.g., "Arrive Customer" must match a low-speed GPS reading).  

- **Integration Steps:**  
  1. **Case Definition:** Use `Vehicle ID + Date` as the case identifier (`Case ID`).  
  2. **Event Alignment:**  
     - GPS events: Discretize into activities (e.g., "Travel," "Idle," "Low Speed [Traffic]").  
     - Scanner events: Map to milestones (e.g., "Scan at Depot"  "Departure Confirmed").  
     - Dispatch data: Attach planned route stops and time windows to each case.  
     - Maintenance logs: Flag "Unscheduled Stop" during shifts.  
  3. **Temporal Syncing:** Align scanner events with GPS data within ±2 minutes tolerance.  
  4. **Attribute Enrichment:** Add planned vs. actual locations, time windows, and package IDs to events.  

**Process Discovery:**  
- **Algorithm:** Use the **Inductive Miner** to generate a process model reflecting *actual* flows.  
- **Key Activities:**  
  - Standard Flow: `Start Shift  Depart Depot  Travel  Arrive Customer  Delivery Attempt  Depart Customer  ...  Return Depot  End Shift`.  
  - Deviations: `Unscheduled Stop` (e.g., maintenance), `Delivery Failed`, or `Low Speed [Traffic]`.  
- **Visualization:** Petri nets or BPMN diagrams showing:  
  - Frequency of routes (e.g., 70% linear, 30% with detours).  
  - Common replay traces (e.g., 80% succeed on first delivery attempt).  

**Conformance Checking:**  
- **Comparison:** Overlay planned routes (dispatch) onto the actual model.  
- **Deviation Types:**  
  - **Sequence Deviations:** Drivers visiting stops out of planned order (e.g., due to traffic).  
  - **Unplanned Stops:** Unscheduled maintenance or breaks not in the plan.  
  - **Timing Deviations:** Significant delays at stops (e.g., actual arrival > planned window).  
  - **Missing Activities:** Skipped stops or failed deliveries.  
- **Metrics:**  
  - **Fitness:** % of actual events adhering to the planned model (e.g., 60% fitness indicates high deviation).  
  - **Replay:** Highlight deviations (e.g., red arcs for unplanned stops).

#### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  
| **KPI** | **Calculation** | **Impact** |  
|---------|----------------|------------|  
| On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR) | `(Successful Deliveries within Window / Total Deliveries) × 100` | Customer satisfaction |  
| Avg. Time per Delivery Stop | `(Total 'Arrive' to 'Depart' Time) / Successful Deliveries` | Driver efficiency |  
| Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio | `(Total Travel Time) / (Total Service Time)` | Routing efficiency |  
| Fuel Consumption/km | `(Est. Fuel Usage from Distance/Speed) / Total km` | Operational cost |  
| Vehicle Utilization Rate | `(Total Operational Time) / Shift Duration` | Asset usage |  
| Traffic Delay Frequency | `Count of 'Low Speed' Events > 5 min` | External factor impact |  
| Failed Delivery Rate | `(Failed Deliveries) / (Total Attempts)` | Rework cost |  

**Bottleneck Identification:**  
- **Techniques:**  
  - **Performance Spectrum:** Identify activities with highest duration/variability (e.g., service time at residential vs. commercial zones).  
  - **Variant Analysis:** Compare high- vs. low-performing routes (e.g., Route A: OTDR=90% vs. Route B: 60%).  
  - **Social Network Analysis:** Identify drivers/suppliers causing delays (e.g., Driver D105 has 20% higher avg. service time).  
- **Bottleneck Examples:**  
  - **Hotspots:** GPS shows frequent "Low Speed" near shopping centers (e.g., 8:00–10:00 AM).  
  - **Activities:** High variability in "Depart Customer" time indicates parking issues.  
  - **Temporal:** Afternoon routes show 30% longer travel times vs. morning.  
- **Quantifying Impact:**  
  - Bottleneck X adds 45 mins/day/vehicle  OTDR drops by 15% and fuel costs rise by 10%.

#### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

**Potential Root Causes & Process Mining Validation:**  
| **Root Cause** | **Process Mining Analysis** |  
|----------------|------------------------------|  
| **Suboptimal Routing** | Compare planned vs. actual route distances. Inductive Miner reveals frequent "Detour" variants (e.g., 40% of cases reroute for traffic). |  
| **Inaccurate Travel Estimations** | Scatter plot of planned vs. actual travel times. Shows consistent underestimation (e.g., planned 30 mins, actual 50 mins) on certain roads. |  
| **Traffic Congestion** | Cluster "Low Speed" events by location/time. Heatmap identifies 10:00–11:00 AM bottlenecks on Highway X. |  
| **High Service Time Variability** | Histogram of "Arrive Customer" to "Depart Customer" duration. Peaks at 8 mins (residential) vs. 3 mins (office). |  
| **Vehicle Breakdowns** | Correlate "Unscheduled Stop" with maintenance logs. 70% of stops precede "Repair Needed" events. |  
| **Failed Deliveries** | Variant analysis shows 60% of failures occur after 3:00 PM; linked to "Customer Not Home" notes. |  
| **Driver Behavior** | Social network analysis: Drivers using less fuel-efficient routes show 15% higher idle times. |

#### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Route Re-Optimization**  
- **Targets:** Travel time delays, suboptimal routing.  
- **Root Cause:** Static plans ignore real-time traffic.  
- **Proposal:** Integrate GPS traffic data with dispatch system to re-route vehicles mid-shift.  
- **Process Mining Insights:**  
  - "Low Speed" events on Highway X cause 25% of delays.  
  - Variant analysis shows 70% of efficient routes avoid this road.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  -  20% travel time,  15% OTDR,  10% fuel costs.  

**Strategy 2: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**  
- **Targets:** Unscheduled stops, maintenance costs.  
- **Root Cause:** Reactive maintenance causes downtime.  
- **Proposal:** Use GPS/engine data (idle time, mileage) to predict failures.  
- **Process Mining Insights:**  
  - "Unscheduled Stop" correlates with high mileage (>200 km/day).  
  - Regression models flag vehicles with >80% idle time as high-risk.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  -  50% unscheduled stops,  30% repair costs,  10% vehicle utilization.  

**Strategy 3: Delivery Time Window Optimization**  
- **Targets:** Failed deliveries, OTDR.  
- **Root Cause:** Inflexible time windows and customer availability.  
- **Proposal:** Cluster failed deliveries by location/time; adjust windows for "Customer Not Home" hotspots.  
- **Process Mining Insights:**  
  - 3:00–5:00 PM failures are 3× higher; linked to residential zones.  
  - Variant analysis shows 90% of failures occur at apartments.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  -  40% failed deliveries,  25% OTDR,  15% re-delivery costs.

#### **5. Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

**Accounting for Constraints:**  
- **Driver Hours:** Dynamic routing algorithms cap driving at 8 hours/day (EU regulations).  
- **Vehicle Capacity:** Re-optimization avoids overloading (e.g., stops split if near capacity).  
- **Time Windows:** Adjustments must not violate customer constraints (e.g., "Morning Only" windows).  

**Continuous Monitoring Plan:**  
- **Dashboards:**  
  - **Real-Time KPIs:** Live OTDR, route adherence, and anomaly alerts (e.g., "Vehicle V12 delayed >30 mins").  
  - **Historical Tracking:** Monthly trends for fuel/km, failed delivery rates, and maintenance costs.  
- **Process Views:**  
  - **Conformance Monitoring:** Weekly replay of planned vs. actual routes.  
  - **Bottleneck Heatmaps:** Visualize recurring traffic/service delays.  
  - **Variant Analysis:** Track emerging variants (e.g., spike in "Failed Delivery" routes).  
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  - Monthly process mining audits to refine models (e.g., update traffic patterns).  
  - Alert thresholds: Trigger re-optimization if OTDR drops below 85% or fuel costs rise 15%.

### Summary
By integrating event data into a unified log, Speedy Parcels can discover actual process flows, quantify deviations from plans, and pinpoint bottlenecks (e.g., traffic, service time). Optimization strategies—dynamic routing, predictive maintenance, and time window adjustments—target root causes validated by process mining. Continuous monitoring ensures sustained improvements while respecting operational constraints, ultimately enhancing punctuality and reducing costs.
