Let's break this down step by step to analyze the event log and uncover performance patterns.

### **1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**

We calculate the total cycle time for each case (from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket"):

- **Case 101**: 2024-03-01 08:00  2024-03-01 10:15 = **2h 15m**
- **Case 102**: 2024-03-01 08:05  2024-03-02 09:15 = **25h 10m**
- **Case 103**: 2024-03-01 08:10  2024-03-01 09:30 = **1h 20m**
- **Case 104**: 2024-03-01 08:20  2024-03-02 08:30 = **24h 10m**
- **Case 105**: 2024-03-01 08:25  2024-03-03 09:30 = **49h 5m**

 **Outliers**:
- **Case 102** (~25h): Over 10x longer than average.
- **Case 104** (~24h): Also significantly delayed.
- **Case 105** (~49h): The longest resolution time.

> Average of *non-delayed* cases (101 & 103): ~1.8h  
> 102, 104, and especially 105 clearly deviate from the norm.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis: What’s Causing the Delays?**

Let’s look at delays **between** events and presence of **escalations**.

#### **Case 102**
- **Escalation?** Yes  `Escalate to Level-2 Agent` at 11:30 on Mar 1.
- **Big gap**: After escalation, next activity is `Investigate Issue` at **14:00 on Mar 1** (wait = 2.5h), then another **19-hour gap** until resolution on Mar 2.
- **Insight**: Investigation started same-day post-escalation, but resolution only next day — possibly idle overnight.

#### **Case 104**
- **No escalation**, but:
- **Huge delay**: `Assign to Level-1 Agent` at 09:30  `Investigate Issue` at **13:00** (wait = **3h 30m**).
- Then another **long delay**: Investigation  resolution takes nearly 19 hours.
- **Insight**: Delayed investigation start and overnight gap suggest under-resourcing or prioritization issues.

#### **Case 105**
- **Escalation?** Yes  `Escalate to Level-2 Agent` at 10:00 on Mar 1.
- **Massive gap**: No activity until **14:00 on Mar 2** — **almost 28 hours** delay after escalation.
- Investigation starts next day, resolution follows next morning.
- **Insight**: Escalated ticket sat idle for a full day — likely lack of Level-2 capacity or poor handoff process.

### **3. Patterns & Performance Bottlenecks**

####  **Key Observations**
| Factor | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Escalation** | Cases with escalation (102, 105) show **long idle periods post-escalation** — especially 105. |
| **Wait Time Before Investigation** | Case 104 shows long handoff delay even without escalation. |
| **Overnight Delays** | All long-running cases have gaps spanning end-of-day, indicating **lack of after-hours coverage** or poor queuing. |
| **No Off-Hours Processing** | Work resumes at ~8–9 AM next day — business hours bottleneck. |

####  **Root Causes**
1. **Level-2 Bottleneck**: Escalated tickets (102, 105) wait **hours to days** before being picked up, suggesting **limited Level-2 capacity** or **poor prioritization of escalations**.
2. **Inefficient Handoffs**: Delays between assignment/investigation/escalation point to **poor task routing** or **agent availability gaps**.
3. **No SLA Enforcement**: No evidence of urgency or alerting for pending escalations.
4. **Working Hours Dependency**: Most delays align with business hours — tickets don’t get processed outside 8–9 AM to 5 PM.

### **Recommendations**

1. **Monitor Escalation Queue Age**  
    Implement real-time alerts when an escalated ticket isn't actioned within 1–2 hours.

2. **Improve Level-2 Capacity or Rotations**  
    Consider staggered shifts or on-call rotation for Level-2 agents to reduce next-day delays.

3. **Set SLAs for Handoff Times**  
    Define max allowable time between:
   - Assignment  Investigation
   - Escalation  Level-2 Investigation
   (e.g., <1 hour for Level-1, <2 hours for Level-2)

4. **Automate Assignment Post-Escalation**  
    Ensure Level-2 tickets are auto-assigned and appear in the correct queue.

5. **Analyze Ticket Volume vs. Staffing**  
    If many escalations occur on certain days, adjust staffing or upstream triage to reduce unnecessary escalations.

6. **Introduce Business Hours Adjustment in Metrics**  
    Distinguish between active processing time and calendar delays due to nights/weekends.

###  **Summary of Insights**

- **Delayed cases**: 102, 104, 105 — all involve **long idle periods**, particularly across days.
- **Primary driver of extended cycle time**: **Escalation delays** and **after-hours stagnation**.
- Most cycle time isn’t active work — it’s **waiting** due to process inefficiencies, not complexity.

> **Bottom Line**: The biggest bottleneck isn’t how long it takes to resolve a ticket — it’s how long tickets **wait** to be worked on, especially after escalation.
