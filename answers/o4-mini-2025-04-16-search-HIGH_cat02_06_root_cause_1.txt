## 1. Cases with Extended Resolution Times

By computing the elapsed time from “Receive Ticket” to “Close Ticket” for each case, we find:

- **Case 103**: 08:10  09:30 on 2024-03-01  **1 h 20 m**  
- **Case 101**: 08:00  10:15 on 2024-03-01  **2 h 15 m**  
- **Case 104**: 08:20 on 2024-03-01  08:30 on 2024-03-02  **24 h 10 m**  
- **Case 102**: 08:05 on 2024-03-01  09:15 on 2024-03-02  **25 h 10 m**  
- **Case 105**: 08:25 on 2024-03-01  09:30 on 2024-03-03  **49 h 05 m**

The overall average resolution time is roughly **20 h 24 m**. Cases 102, 104, and especially 105 exceed this average substantially, indicating performance outliers.

## 2. Potential Root Causes

1. **Escalation-Related Delays**  
   - Cases 102 and 105 both escalate to Level-2 (L2) support.  
   - In Case 102: the ticket is escalated at 11:30 AM on March 1, investigated at 2:00 PM the same day, but then sits idle until 9:00 AM the next morning  ~19 h idle.  
   - In Case 105: after escalation at 10:00 AM on March 1, the next activity (investigation) doesn’t occur until 2:00 PM on March 2  ~28 h gap.  
   - These gaps suggest that L2 assignment or handoff processes lack timely scheduling and may depend on limited shifts or manual routing.

2. **Overnight/Outside-Business-Hours Bottlenecks**  
   - Case 104 never escalates but, after beginning investigation at 1:00 PM on March 1, only gets resolved at 8:00 AM on March 2  ~19 h overnight wait.  
   - Similarly, non-escalated tickets aren’t processed outside core hours, forcing resolution tasks to wait for the next business day.

3. **Long Inter-Activity Waits**  
   - In Case 104: “Assign to Level-1” occurs at 9:30 AM, but investigation doesn’t start until 1:00 PM  **3½ h idle** even during business hours.  
   - In Case 102: nearly 2½ h passes between “Assign to Level-1” and “Escalate to Level-2,” potentially reflecting slow decision or authorization processes.

## 3. How These Factors Inflate Cycle Time

- **Handoff Inefficiencies**  
  Each escalation requires manual coordination between teams. Without automated notifications or real-time routing, tickets languish in queues, compounding overall duration.

- **Shift-Based Processing**  
  If support activities are restricted to standard business hours, any work that bridges an overnight period effectively adds an entire non-working block to cycle time.

- **Lack of Parallelism**  
  Sequential progression (triage  assign  investigate  resolve) means that delays in any one stage propagate downstream without overlap or contingency steps to mitigate them.

## 4. Recommendations to Reduce Bottlenecks

1. **Implement Automated Escalation Routing**  
   - Use ticket-routing rules or an SLA-driven engine that immediately notifies and assigns escalated tickets to the correct L2 resource, reducing manual handoff times.

2. **Extend Coverage or Introduce Follow-the-Sun Shifts**  
   - Even a small overnight or weekend on-call rotation can eliminate the 19–28 hour holds observed in both escalated (Cases 102, 105) and non-escalated (Case 104) scenarios.

3. **Enforce Stage-Specific SLAs with Alerts**  
   - Define maximum allowable wait times per stage (e.g., “Investigate within 1 h of assignment”). Trigger reminders or manager escalations when thresholds are breached.

4. **Parallelize Preliminary Investigation**  
   - Allow Level-1 agents to begin gathering logs or asking clarifying questions immediately upon receipt, even if the ticket may soon be escalated, so that L2 has context and can hit the ground running.

5. **Monitor and Optimize Idle Time**  
   - Regularly analyze inter-activity gaps (e.g., assigninvestigate, escalateinvestigate) via dashboards. Target the longest-lag segments for process improvement workshops or automation pilots.

By streamlining handoffs, covering critical time windows, and enforcing tighter stage SLAs, the organization can drive down the outlier resolution times (notably Cases 102, 104, and 105) and align overall cycle times closer to the 1–3 hour range demonstrated by the best-performing tickets.
