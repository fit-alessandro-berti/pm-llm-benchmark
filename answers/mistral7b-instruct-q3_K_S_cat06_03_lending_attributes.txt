The following attributes in this data set could be considered sensitive for fairness:

* `resource 4` and `resource 3`: These resources could represent the source of the loan application, and if one resource is more prevalent or has a higher acceptance rate than others, it may give an unfair advantage to applicants from that resource.
* `loan officer 1` and `loan officer 2`: The loan officers may have different decision-making criteria or biases, which could lead to disparities in lending decisions.
* `mostChillUW`: This attribute may indicate the degree of caution or strictness of the underwriting process, and if it varies across loan applications, it could lead to discrimination against some applicants.
* `strict UW1`, `strict UW2`, and `strict UW3`: Similar to `mostChillUW`, these attributes may indicate the degree of caution or strictness of the underwriting process, and if they vary across loan applications, it could lead to discrimination against some applicants.
* `chill UW1`, `chill UW2`, and `chill UW3`: These attributes may indicate the degree of caution or strictness of the underwriting process, and if they vary across loan applications, it could lead to discrimination against some applicants.
* `sign Loan Agreement`: This attribute may indicate that the loan officer approved the loan, which could lead to disparities in lending decisions if some loan officers are more lenient than others.
