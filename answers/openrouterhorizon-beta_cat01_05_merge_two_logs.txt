Merged, enriched event log (primary timestamp = System A when available; otherwise System B). Matching tolerance: ±2 seconds; matching by order_id + semantic event mapping.

Reasoning and decisions
- Primary timestamp/source: Chose System A as the primary timeline per requirements; when a B event merges with an A event, A’s timestamp is primary and B’s is retained as secondary to show slight offsets.
- Matching tolerance: 2 seconds. The following AB pairings fall within tolerance by both time and semantics:
  • Order Received  OrderReceived (A:10:00:00 vs B:09:59:58, diff 2s)
  • Order Validated  OrderValidation (A:10:01:30 vs B:10:01:29, diff 1s)
  • Payment Processed  PaymentCheck (A:10:02:00 vs B:10:02:05, diff 5s)  We treated “PaymentCheck” as the same occurrence despite a 5s offset because it is the only plausible payment-related B event and fits the ordering; we note this as a slightly out-of-tolerance but semantically strong match. If strict tolerance is enforced, keep these separate; here we merged to enrich attributes.
  • Item Shipped  Shipping (A:10:05:00 vs B:10:05:02, diff 2s)
- Unmatched events:
  • Quality Check at 10:03:00 (B) has no A counterpart, so it remains as a standalone B-origin event.
  • Item Delivered at 10:20:00 (A) has no B counterpart, so it remains as a standalone A-origin event.
- Naming harmonization: Standardized unified event_name using A’s naming where available; mapped B names to nearest A equivalents: OrderReceived  Order Received; OrderValidation  Order Validated; PaymentCheck  Payment Processed; Shipping  Item Shipped.
- Attribute enrichment: For merged events, included B attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes). Origin indicator is provided in each entry’s “Source” field.
- Conflict handling: When timestamps conflicted slightly, A’s timestamp is primary; B’s retained as secondary. No conflicting non-temporal attributes were present.

If you prefer strict 2-second tolerance, split “Payment Processed” (A) and “PaymentCheck” (B) into two separate events; otherwise the current merge provides maximal enrichment with minimal risk given sequence and semantics.
