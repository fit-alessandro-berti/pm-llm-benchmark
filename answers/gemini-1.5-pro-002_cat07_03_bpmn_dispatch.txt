The visualization is a cross-functional flowchart depicting the process of dispatching goods at a Computer Hardware Shop. It outlines the steps involved across different departments: Secretary, Warehouse, and Logistics.  The process begins with "Ship goods".

Here's a breakdown following the flow:

1. **Secretary:**
    * **Ship Goods:** This is the starting point.
    * **Clarify Shipment Method:** The shipment method is determined.
    * **Special Handling?:** A decision point to check if special handling is required.
    * **If "no" for special handling:**
        * **Check if Insurance is Required:** Based on order details and customer information, a check is performed.
        * **If Insurance Necessary:** Proceeds to "Insure Parcel" in the Logistics swimlane.
        * **Always:** Proceeds to "Write Package Label" regardless of insurance.
    * **If "yes" for special handling:** The process joins the path after insurance is considered and proceeds to "Write Package Label."

2. **Logistics:**
    * **Insure Parcel:** (Only if insurance is necessary)
    * **Write Package Label:**  A package label is created.
    * **Get 3 offers from logistic companies:** Logistics companies are contacted for quotes.
    * **Select Logistic Company and Place Order:** A logistics company is chosen, and the shipment order is placed.

3. **Warehouse:**
    * **Package Goods:**  The goods are packaged (48-hour delay built into the process).
    * **Notify Customer about Delay:** If there's a delay after 48 hours, the customer is notified.
    * After packaging:
        * **Fill out Shipment Paperwork:** Necessary paperwork is completed.
        * **Move Package to Pickup Area:**  The package is moved to the designated pickup area.
        * **Shipment Prepared:** The process ends, indicating the shipment is ready for pickup.

The diagram uses different symbols to represent various actions:

* **Oval:** Start and end points.
* **Rectangle:** Process steps.
* **Diamond:** Decision points.
* **Cylinder:** Data store (customer information).
* **Document Icon:** Order details.
* **Clock:** Delay.
* **X in Diamond:** Merge paths.
* **+ in Diamond:** Split/fork paths.
* **Arrows:** Indicate the flow of the process.

The swimlanes (Secretary, Warehouse, Logistics) clearly delineate the responsibilities of each department in the overall process.
