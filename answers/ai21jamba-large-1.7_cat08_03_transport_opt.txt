### Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**

1. **Integration of Data Sources**:
	- **Timestamp Alignment**: Ensure all data sources (GPS, scanners, dispatch, and maintenance logs) are synchronized to a common timezone and granularity (e.g., seconds).
	- **Event Log Construction**:
		- **Case IDs**: Use `Vehicle ID` combined with `Date` as the unique identifier for each vehicle’s operations in a day.
		- **Activities**: Use `Event Type` or `Activity/Status` to describe the steps in the delivery process (e.g., "Depart Depot," "Arrive Customer," "Delivery Success").
		- **Attributes**: Include supporting data (e.g., vehicle ID, driver ID, package ID, location, and speed) as event attributes.
		- **Sequence**: Order events by `Timestamp` and ensure they are linked by `Case ID`.
	- **Route and Scheduling Data**: Incorporate planned routes and delivery time windows from the dispatch system.
	- **Vehicle Maintenance**: Integrate maintenance records as events, noting when and how they intersect with operational activities.

### **Challenges**:

- **Data Quality Issues**: Missing data (e.g., skipped scans), inconsistent timestamps, or incorrect location fixes.
- **Granularity Gaps**: Variation in event logging frequencies (e.g., GPS positions logged every few seconds vs. scanner logs for milestones).
- **Data Volume**: Handling six months of event data requires scalable process mining tools or pre-aggregating data for high-priority KPIs.

### **Process Discovery**:

- **Algorithm**: Apply a process discovery algorithm (e.g., Heuristics Miner, Fuzzy Miner, or Inductive Miner) to generate an **actual process model** from the event log.
- **Outcome**: Visualize the delivery process, including:
	- **Main Path**: Standard sequence (e.g., "Depart Depot  Arrive Customer  Delivery Success  Return Depot").
	- **Variants**: Highlight deviations (e.g., failed deliveries, unscheduled stops).
	- **Time Dimensions**: Include average and variance of activity durations and travel times.

### **Conformance Checking**:

- **Comparing Actual vs. Planned Processes**:
	- Align the discovered process model with the **planned routes** from the dispatch system.
	- Identify deviations such as:
		- **Sequence Deviations**: Skipped stops or out-of-order deliveries.
		- **Timing Deviations**: Late arrivals or prolonged service time.
		- **Unplanned Events**: Stops for maintenance, traffic delays, or extended idle times.

## **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:

1. **Delivery Performance**:
	- On-Time Delivery Rate (% of deliveries meeting customer time windows).
	- Average Time per Delivery Stop (scan arrival to departure).
	- Rate of Failed Deliveries (% of stops with failed deliveries).
	- Reattempt Rate (% of failed deliveries requiring a reattempt).
2. **Operational Efficiency**:
	- Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio.
	- Vehicle Utilization Rate (percentage of operational shift time spent delivering).
3. **Cost-Related Metrics**:
	- Fuel Consumption per Package or Kilometer.
	- Maintenance Duration vs. Operational Time.

### **Performance Metrics Calculation**:

- Use timestamps from the GPS and scanner logs to calculate durations for travel, idling, and delivery.
- Use GPS and fuel consumption (if recorded) for mileage-based KPIs.

### **Bottleneck Identification**:

- **Process Mining Techniques**:
	- Use **variant analysis** to compare efficient vs. inefficient delivery routes.
	- Identify **time-consuming activities** (e.g., extended idle times, repeated customer visits).
	- Apply **time-series analysis** to detect recurring bottlenecks in specific locations, times of day, or routes.
- **Examples of Bottlenecks**:
	- **Time-Based**: Peak-hour deliveries leading to congestion-related delays.
	- **Activity-Specific**: High service times caused by customer unavailability.
	- **Vehicle-Specific**: Certain vehicle types or routes with higher travel/maintenance issues.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes**:

1. **Route and Scheduling Issues**:
	- Suboptimal routing (static routes failing to adapt to real-time conditions like traffic).
	- Overloading certain vehicles or inefficient load balancing.
2. **Traffic Congestion**:
	- Variability in travel time due to peak-hour delays or roadwork.
3. **Service Time Variability**:
	- Delays caused by customer availability or finding parking in dense urban areas.
4. **Vehicle Breakdown**:
	- Higher frequency of unscheduled stops and maintenance needs.
5. **Driver-Related Factors**:
	- Variability in driving behavior (speed, idling) or route adherence.
6. **Failed Deliveries**:
	- Customer-related issues (not home, incorrect address), leading to re-deliveries and costs.

### **Validation with Process Mining**:

1. **Variant Analysis**:
	- Compare performance (time, cost) across routes, drivers, or times of day.
	- Identify high-performing vs. low-performing routes or vehicles.
2. **Correlation Analysis**:
	- Link traffic data (external source) with GPS-based delays to confirm congestion effects.
3. **Activity-Specific Dwell Time Analysis**:
	- Quantify time spent on specific activities (e.g., "Arrive Customer" to "Depart Customer").
4. **Maintenance Impact Analysis**:
	- Assess how unscheduled maintenance disrupts delivery schedules and vehicle availability.

## **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Implement Dynamic Routing**

- **Targeted Inefficiency**: Suboptimal route planning that fails to adapt to real-time traffic or delays.
- **Root Cause**: Static route assignment; unexpected traffic or customer unavailability.
- **Process Mining Supported Insights**:
	- Use historical GPS and delivery logs to create optimized route variants.
	- Integrate real-time traffic data to dynamically update routes during shifts.
- **Expected Impact**:
	- Reduced travel time and fuel consumption.
	- Higher on-time delivery rates.

### **Strategy 2: Optimize Delivery Time Windows**

- **Targeted Inefficiency**: High rate of failed deliveries due to poor time window estimation or communication.
- **Root Cause**: Inflexible delivery time windows; inaccurate predictions of service times.
- **Process Mining Supported Insights**:
	- Analyze historical delivery success rates across time windows.
	- Provide estimated service times to customers dynamically based on past performance.
- **Expected Impact**:
	- Lower failed deliveries and reattempts.
	- Improved customer satisfaction.

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance and Driver Performance**

- **Targeted Inefficiency**: Vehicles breaking down or idling during shifts, leading to delays.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of predictive maintenance and suboptimal driver behavior (e.g., excessive idling).
- **Process Mining Supported Insights**:
	- Identify patterns in maintenance logs related to breakdowns (triggers and timing).
	- Analyze driver behavior linked to fuel efficiency and service time deviations.
- **Expected Impact**:
	- Fewer vehicle breakdowns and lower maintenance costs.
	- Reduced fuel consumption and travel times.

## **5. Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring**

### **Addressing Constraints**:

1. **Driver Working Hours**: Ensure planned routes respect shift duration and overtime limits.
2. **Vehicle Capacity**: Balance load volumes to prevent overloading or underutilization.
3. **Customer Time Windows**: Prioritize meeting critical time windows while maintaining overall route efficiency.

### **Continuous Monitoring Plan**:

1. **Process Mining Dashboards**:
	- Real-time visibility into **KPIs** (on-time delivery, budget adherence, traffic delays).
	- **Variant Monitoring**: Track process execution to identify recurring deviations.
	- **Bottleneck Alerts**: Automated detection of traffic hotspots, prolonged delays, or maintenance issues.
2. **Key Metrics to Track**:
	- Route efficiency (travel time, planned vs. actual).
	- Vehicle utilization and fuel consumption.
	- Failed delivery and reattempt rates.
	- Maintenance frequency and vehicle downtime.
3. **Continuous Improvement**:
	- Monthly reviews of process insights for recalibrating routes and schedules.
	- Driver feedback integration for addressing practical challenges.

## **Conclusion**:

By combining **process discovery, performance analysis**, and **root cause validation**, Speedy Parcels can leverage process mining to transition from reactive to proactive optimization. The strategies proposed address both **operational inefficiencies** and **cost drivers**, while ongoing monitoring ensures sustainable improvements and adaptability to changing conditions.
