To solve this problem in DuckDB, we can use **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **Window Functions** (`LEAD`). 

Window functions allow us to look at the next rows within the same `case_id` to verify direct succession and calculate time differences.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
WITH EventSequences AS (
    -- Step 1: Use LEAD to look ahead at the next two activities and their timestamps
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS third_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS third_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
ExcludedCases AS (
    -- Step 2: Identify cases matching the sequence and the time condition
    -- Sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'
    -- Condition: 'Confirm Order' - 'Create Order' > 5 days
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM EventSequences
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND third_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (third_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
-- Step 3: Return all events for cases NOT in the exclusion list
SELECT 
    case_id, 
    activity, 
    timestamp
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM ExcludedCases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation:

1.  **`EventSequences` CTE**:
    *   We use `LEAD(activity, 1)` to see the immediate next event and `LEAD(activity, 2)` to see the event after that within each `case_id`.
    *   We also fetch the timestamps for those future events to perform the duration calculation.
    *   The `PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp` ensures that we only look at events belonging to the same process instance in their correct chronological order.

2.  **`ExcludedCases` CTE**:
    *   We filter for the specific pattern where the current row is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the third is 'Confirm Order'.
    *   We apply the logic `(third_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'`. This specifically measures the gap between the second and third steps of that sequence.
    *   `SELECT DISTINCT case_id` ensures we get a unique list of IDs that met this "bad" criteria.

3.  **Final Selection**:
    *   We select all columns from the original `event_log`.
    *   We use `WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)` to filter out every event associated with the cases identified in the previous step.
    *   Finally, we order the results by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain the logical flow of the process log.
