# Comprehensive Process Mining Strategy for Fulfillment Center Optimization: Managing Instance-Spanning Constraints

## Section 1: Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

### Foundational Approach: Preparing the Event Log

Before applying specific techniques, the event log must be enriched and structured appropriately. Each event record must carry both case-level attributes (Order Type, Destination Region, Requires Cold Packing, Hazardous Material flag) and precise START/COMPLETE timestamps with resource assignments. From these raw events, we derive activity durations, resource utilization timelines, and crucially, the inter-case waiting periods that are the fingerprints of instance-spanning constraints.

The analysis begins by constructing a **resource-timeline overlay** — a synchronized view of all cases mapped against shared resources over time. This allows us to visually and algorithmically detect when a case's waiting period is causally explained by another case's occupancy of the same resource.

---

### 1A. Shared Cold-Packing Stations (Limited Specialized Resource)

**Identification Technique:**

Using resource-centric process mining, we extract all events where the Resource column contains Cold-Packing station identifiers (C1 through C5 in the scenario). We construct a **resource utilization Gantt chart** showing each station's occupancy over time. For every order requiring cold packing, we compute:

- **Expected Wait Start:** The timestamp when the previous activity (Item Picking COMPLETE) ended for that order
- **Actual Activity Start:** The timestamp when Packing START is recorded at a Cold-Packing station
- **Queue Entry Observation:** If Packing START is significantly later than Picking COMPLETE, and all 5 cold stations are confirmed occupied during that interval (via the resource timeline), the gap is attributable to cold-station contention

We apply a **queue reconstruction algorithm**: at any timestamp T, count the number of orders whose Picking COMPLETE time  T AND whose Packing START time > T AND whose Cold Packing flag = TRUE. This gives us the instantaneous cold-packing queue depth.

**Specific Metrics:**

| Metric | Calculation | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Cold-Pack Waiting Time (CPWT) | Packing_START  Picking_COMPLETE (for cold orders only, excluding cases with zero-minute transition) | Average/median/90th percentile waiting due to station unavailability |
| Cold Station Utilization Rate | Sum(active occupancy time) / (5 stations × total observation hours) | Whether stations are at capacity or have slack |
| Cold Queue Length Distribution | Count of orders waiting at each hour/day of week | Peak demand periods |
| Cold-Wait as % of Total Cycle Time | CPWT / (Order Received  Shipping Label) | Relative impact on end-to-end performance |

**Expected Findings:** During peak hours or peak seasons, CPWT likely spikes dramatically. If the 90th percentile CPWT exceeds, say, 45 minutes while average cold packing activity duration is only 15 minutes, the resource is clearly the bottleneck, not the activity itself.

---

### 1B. Shipping Batch Formation Delays

**Identification Technique:**

Batching delays are identified by examining the gap between Quality Check COMPLETE and Shipping Label Generation COMPLETE (or START, if available). The event log notes "System (Batch B1)" as the resource for Shipping Label Gen., which gives us the batch identifier. We reconstruct batch membership by grouping all orders sharing the same Batch ID or, if not explicitly logged, by grouping orders with identical Destination Region and Shipping Label timestamps that are within a narrow temporal window.

For each batch, we identify:
- The **earliest Quality Check COMPLETE** across all batch members (the first order ready)
- The **latest Quality Check COMPLETE** (the last order ready, triggering batch release)
- The **Shipping Label Generation timestamp** (when the batch was processed)

The waiting time attributable to batching for any individual order is: `Batch_Release_Time  Order_QC_COMPLETE_Time`. The first-ready order waits longest; the last-ready order waits near zero time for batch formation (though may still wait for label generation processing).

**Specific Metrics:**

| Metric | Calculation | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Batch Wait Time (BWT) | Shipping_Label_START  QC_COMPLETE per order | Individual order delay from batching |
| Batch Formation Duration | Latest_QC_COMPLETE  Earliest_QC_COMPLETE within batch | How long a batch takes to accumulate |
| Batch Size Distribution | Count of orders per batch | Whether batch sizes are consistent |
| Regional Batch Frequency | Batches per region per day | Dispatch cadence by region |
| Premature Completion Ratio | Orders that completed QC >X minutes before batch release | Proportion of orders suffering significant hold |

**Technique — Dotted Chart Analysis:** Plotting all orders on a timeline with events as dots, grouped by Destination Region, visually reveals the "staircase" pattern of batch releases — many orders complete QC, then all simultaneously receive Shipping Labels at a fixed dispatch time. This is the visual signature of batch-induced waiting.

---

### 1C. Priority Handling (Express Order Preemption)

**Identification Technique:**

Preemption leaves a specific pattern in the event log: a standard order's activity on a resource has a COMPLETE timestamp, but the resource was simultaneously assigned to an express order between the standard order's natural expected completion and actual completion, OR a standard order shows an unusually long duration at a step compared to its historical baseline.

More precisely, we look for **resource-level timeline interruptions**:
1. Standard Order A starts Packing at Station S7 at 10:20
2. Express Order B arrives needing Packing at 10:22
3. Station S7's next event shows Express Order B's Packing START (if A was paused/preempted)
4. Standard Order A's Packing COMPLETE is delayed beyond its expected duration

We compare actual activity durations for standard orders against the distribution of that activity's duration in periods with no express orders present — any statistically significant elongation during periods of express order presence indicates preemption effect.

We also measure **queue-jumping impact**: for express orders, compute (Expected wait based on FIFO queue position)  (Actual wait). Negative values confirm the express order jumped ahead.

**Specific Metrics:**

| Metric | Calculation | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Express-Induced Delay (EID) for Standard Orders | Actual duration during express overlap  baseline duration | Time added to standard orders per preemption event |
| Express Order Priority Benefit | FIFO-expected wait  Actual wait for express orders | Time saved for express orders |
| Preemption Frequency | Count of interruption events per day | How often standard orders are disrupted |
| Express Order Cycle Time | End-to-end time for express vs. standard orders | Whether priority handling achieves SLA targets |
| Collateral Delay Propagation | Downstream delay in standard orders after preemption | Cascade effects through subsequent steps |

---

### 1D. Hazardous Material Regulatory Limits

**Identification Technique:**

This constraint is a **global concurrency limit** across the facility. We reconstruct the instantaneous count of hazardous orders in Packing or Quality Check at every moment T:

```
Hazmat_Active(T) = count of orders where:
  Hazardous_Material = TRUE
  AND (Packing_START  T  Packing_COMPLETE
       OR QC_START  T  QC_COMPLETE)
```

We plot this count as a time series. Whenever it reaches 10, any newly arriving hazardous order must wait — this waiting is attributable to the regulatory constraint. We identify **constraint-binding intervals** (periods where Hazmat_Active(T) = 10) and compute for each delayed order the duration of its forced wait before it could enter Packing or Quality Check.

**Specific Metrics:**

| Metric | Calculation | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Regulatory Binding Time | Sum of durations where Hazmat_Active(T) = 10 | How often the 10-order cap is reached |
| Hazmat-Induced Wait (HIW) | Activity_START  Previous_Activity_COMPLETE for hazmat orders during binding | Delay directly caused by regulatory limit |
| Hazmat Throughput Rate | Hazmat orders completed per hour during peak | Actual processing speed vs. theoretical |
| Compliance Margin | Distribution of peak Hazmat_Active values | How close to limit the facility operates |
| Non-Hazmat Impact | Throughput change at Packing/QC during binding intervals | Whether hazmat limits affect overall flow |

---

### 1E. Differentiating Within-Instance vs. Between-Instance Waiting Time

This differentiation is methodologically critical and requires a systematic decomposition of each inter-activity gap:

**Framework for Gap Decomposition:**

For any gap between Activity_A_COMPLETE and Activity_B_START for a given order:

```
Total Gap = Within-Instance Time + Between-Instance Time

Where:
Within-Instance Time = Time attributable to:
  - Transport/handoff between physical locations
  - Internal process preparation time
  - Data entry or system processing delays specific to this order
  
Between-Instance Time = Time attributable to:
  - Resource occupied by another order (contention waiting)
  - Waiting for batch to form (other orders not ready)
  - Regulatory limit reached (other hazmat orders present)
  - Preempted by higher-priority order from another case
```

**Practical Decomposition Method:**

**Step 1 — Establish Baseline Within-Instance Times:** For each activity transition (e.g., PickingPacking), analyze the distribution of transition times when the next resource is *immediately available* (confirmed by resource timeline showing the station was idle at the moment the previous activity completed). The median or 25th percentile of these "uncontested" transitions represents the irreducible within-instance time.

**Step 2 — Resource Availability Check:** For each observed gap, check the target resource's timeline. If the resource was busy throughout the gap, the entire gap minus the baseline within-instance time is between-instance (resource contention).

**Step 3 — Batch Wait Attribution:** If the next activity is Shipping Label Generation and the order belongs to a batch, the batch formation period is classified as between-instance.

**Step 4 — Regulatory Wait Attribution:** If the order is hazmat and the Hazmat_Active count was at 10 throughout the gap, the excess gap beyond baseline is between-instance (regulatory).

**Step 5 — Residual Analysis:** Any remaining unexplained gap is classified as within-instance (e.g., unusual activity complexity, rework, data issues for that specific order).

This produces for each case: `[Within-Instance Wait, Cold-Resource Wait, Batch Wait, Preemption Wait, Regulatory Wait]` — a decomposed waiting time profile that directly quantifies the impact of each constraint.

## Section 2: Analyzing Constraint Interactions

The four constraints do not operate in isolation. Their interactions create compound effects that are more damaging than any single constraint acting alone, and optimization strategies that ignore these interactions will underperform or create unintended consequences.

### Interaction 1: Express Orders × Cold-Packing Scarcity (Amplified Resource Contention)

When an express order requiring cold packing arrives, it not only jumps the cold-packing queue but may preempt an in-progress standard cold-pack order. This has cascading effects:

- The preempted standard order returns to the queue, now behind additional express and standard orders that may have arrived during preemption
- The cold-packing queue grows longer for all subsequent standard orders because the express order's cold-packing time is "additional" occupancy of the already scarce cold station
- If multiple express cold-pack orders arrive in close succession (which is likely during peak periods since express is a premium service offered precisely when demand is high), the cold-packing queue can become severely backed up specifically for standard cold-pack orders

**Quantification:** Cross-tabulate CPWT (Cold-Pack Wait Time) by whether at least one express cold-pack order was active during the waiting period. We expect to find CPWT is 2-4× higher for standard cold-pack orders that waited while express orders were present vs. those that didn't.

**Interaction Implication:** Any strategy addressing cold-packing scarcity must explicitly account for express order frequency. A simple FIFO queue improvement at cold packing would be undone if express preemption is not also addressed.

---

### Interaction 2: Batching × Hazardous Material Limits (Regulatory Clustering Risk)

Orders destined for the same geographic region often share demographic and product-type characteristics. If a particular region (e.g., "South") has high demand for products that include hazardous materials (industrial cleaners, batteries, etc.), then batch formation creates a dangerous convergence: multiple hazmat orders complete QC at roughly the same time (having been processed as part of the same operational wave), then simultaneously enter the Packing queue for the next available batch.

This means:
- Multiple hazmat orders simultaneously enter Packing, rapidly consuming the 10-order regulatory limit
- Other hazmat orders (from different regions) that happen to arrive at Packing during this window are forced to wait
- The batch itself may be delayed because orders within it are waiting for regulatory clearance, creating a feedback loop where the batch formation time extends because some members are held at Packing

**Quantification:** Analyze temporal clustering of hazmat orders entering Packing, broken down by destination region. Compute correlation between batch formation timing and hazmat regulatory binding events. If binding events spike 15-30 minutes after major batch-processing windows, the interaction is confirmed.

**Interaction Implication:** Batching logic must consider the hazmat composition of orders being grouped. Mixing hazmat and non-hazmat orders in batches, or staggering hazmat orders across time, can prevent these binding events.

---

### Interaction 3: Priority Handling × Batching (Express Orders Disrupting Batch Timelines)

Express orders by definition have tight delivery windows, making batching with standard orders problematic:

- An express order completing QC should not wait for a standard-order batch to form — the batching constraint effectively nullifies the priority advantage that was gained at earlier steps
- Conversely, if express orders are excluded from batching (given dedicated single-order label generation), their individual route optimization is inferior, potentially affecting delivery performance despite fast processing

Furthermore, if an express order was added to an existing regional batch because it appeared to be the "last order needed" to trigger dispatch, and another standard order in that batch was delayed (perhaps by a regulatory hazmat hold), the express order may actually be held waiting for the batch when it should have been dispatched individually.

**Quantification:** For express orders, compute separately: (a) cases where express order was in a batch, (b) cases where it received individual label generation. Compare end-to-end times. Also measure what percentage of express orders missed their delivery SLA specifically due to batch waiting.

**Interaction Implication:** Batching logic needs an explicit bypass or fast-track rule for express orders, but this must be designed carefully to avoid route inefficiencies that cause their own delivery delays.

---

### Interaction 4: All Four Constraints Converging During Peak Season

During peak seasons (holidays, promotional events), all constraints become simultaneously binding:

- Cold-packing demand surges (more perishable gift orders)
- Express order volume spikes (last-minute shoppers)
- Hazmat order volume increases (consumer electronics, cleaning products as gifts)
- Batch sizes grow as regional demand increases, extending batch wait times

This convergence means that a standard cold-pack hazmat order placed during peak season faces: (1) long wait for cold station, (2) further delay if express orders preempt the station, (3) if batched with other hazmat orders, potentially hits the regulatory limit at Packing, (4) finally waits for a large regional batch to form. The compound delays can easily transform a normally 2-hour fulfillment into a 6-8 hour ordeal.

**Why Understanding Interactions is Crucial for Strategy Development:**

Without recognizing these interactions, a process analyst might propose: "Add 2 more cold-packing stations" — which addresses constraint 1 but fails to prevent the batching-hazmat binding loop (constraint 2+4 interaction). Or propose "reduce batch sizes" — which helps batching wait but may create so many small batches that route inefficiency increases delivery times even though fulfillment times improve. Effective optimization must treat the constraint network holistically, designing interventions that are aware of second-order effects on the other constraints.

## Section 3: Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Intelligent Dynamic Resource Allocation with Predictive Queuing for Cold-Packing Stations

**Primary Constraints Addressed:** Shared Cold-Packing (primary), Priority Handling (secondary)

**Specific Changes Proposed:**

*1a. Predictive Queue Management System:* Using the event log's historical data, build a time-of-day and day-of-week demand model for cold-packing requests. The model predicts, at any given moment, how many cold-pack orders are expected to enter the queue in the next 30-60 minutes based on:
- Current Item Picking activity for cold-pack orders (orders currently being picked will arrive at Packing within predictable time windows)
- Historical arrival rate patterns by time-of-day
- Current promotional/seasonal context

This prediction feeds into a **dynamic allocation system** that temporarily converts standard packing stations into cold-capable stations when predicted cold demand exceeds 4× station capacity. (This requires stations with portable cold-pack equipment, or pre-positioned cold supplies at select standard stations — a modest capital investment with high operational flexibility payoff.)

*1b. Differentiated Express Handling for Cold-Packing:*

Instead of hard preemption (which disrupts in-progress standard cold-pack orders and creates wasted partial-work inefficiency), implement a **"next-in-sequence priority"** rule: an express cold-pack order does not interrupt an actively running standard cold-pack job, but is inserted as the absolute next job at the first available cold station. This limits the maximum additional wait for express orders to one cold-packing cycle duration (typically 10-20 minutes based on historical data), while eliminating the wasteful restart costs of preemption.

*1c. Cold-Packing Station Reservation Policy:* Reserve 1 of 5 cold stations exclusively for express orders during peak hours (empirically defined from the historical queue analysis as, e.g., 11am-2pm and 6pm-9pm). Outside peak hours, all 5 stations are shared. This reservation policy is adjusted monthly based on updated demand analysis.

**Data/Analysis Leverage:**

- Historical CPWT by time-of-day  defines peak windows and reservation timing
- Current WIP pipeline (orders in Picking stage)  feeds predictive model
- Cold-packing activity duration distribution  calibrates "next-in-sequence" maximum express wait
- Express order SLA compliance rate  measures effectiveness of reservation policy

**Expected Outcomes:**

- 40-60% reduction in cold-packing queue wait for standard orders (from elimination of preemption waste and dynamic capacity addition)
- Maintained or improved express order cycle time (reservation ensures express orders are never more than one cycle behind)
- Cold station utilization more evenly distributed across hours, reducing peak saturation
- Reduced end-to-end time for all cold-pack orders, with a target of CPWT falling below 20 minutes at the 90th percentile

---

### Strategy 2: Dynamic Batch Formation with Constraint-Aware Dispatch Triggers

**Primary Constraints Addressed:** Shipping Batching (primary), Hazardous Material Limits (secondary), Priority Handling (tertiary)

**Specific Changes Proposed:**

*2a. Replace Fixed-Schedule Batching with Multi-Criteria Dynamic Dispatch:* Currently, batches appear to be formed on a fixed regional schedule (implied by the log pattern). Replace this with a dynamic trigger system where a batch is dispatched when ANY of the following conditions are met:

- **Size Trigger:** Batch reaches N orders (where N is calculated from historical data to represent the point of diminishing route optimization returns — typically 80-90% of maximum route efficiency is achieved with 8-12 orders)
- **Time Trigger:** The oldest order in the batch has been waiting more than T minutes (where T is set at, e.g., 30 minutes for standard, 10 minutes for batches containing any express order)
- **Hazmat Trigger:** The batch contains 3 hazmat orders AND adding another would risk creating a binding regulatory event at Packing for subsequent batch waves
- **Express Override Trigger:** Any express order completing QC is immediately dispatched either solo or with any already-waiting orders for its region

*2b. Hazmat-Aware Batch Composition Management:* When forming batches, the system applies a **hazmat load balancing rule**: if a regional batch already contains 3 hazmat orders, subsequent hazmat orders for that region are held for the next batch cycle (max hold: 15 minutes) rather than being added to the current batch. This prevents the temporal clustering of hazmat orders at Packing that creates regulatory binding events.

*2c. Pre-Batch Staging Buffer:* Create a small "batch staging" zone where orders completing QC wait for their batch. This is already implicit in the current process, but formalizing it with a digital tracking system allows real-time visibility into batch composition, wait times per order in staging, and triggers.

**Data/Analysis Leverage:**

- Historical batch size vs. route efficiency data  calibrate size trigger N
- Historical BWT distribution  set time trigger T at a level that reduces 90th percentile BWT by 50%
- Hazmat temporal clustering analysis  inform hazmat load balancing thresholds
- Express SLA miss analysis  determine express time trigger

*Example Calculation:* If historical data shows that batches of 8+ orders achieve route efficiency within 5% of optimal, but batches of 4-7 orders achieve 85% efficiency, and waiting from 4 to 8 orders takes on average 35 minutes, then the time trigger at 30 minutes means dispatching with 4-7 orders when efficiency trade-off is small relative to BWT saved. The route cost difference can be quantified and compared against the SLA compliance benefit.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- 50-65% reduction in average Batch Wait Time (particularly for first-ready orders in a batch, who currently wait the longest)
- Near-elimination of express orders being held for batch formation
- 30% reduction in hazmat regulatory binding events through temporal deconcentration of hazmat orders across batch waves
- Marginal (5-10%) increase in per-order shipping cost due to slightly smaller average batches — acceptable trade-off given SLA compliance improvements

---

### Strategy 3: Integrated Constraint-Aware Scheduling and Flow Orchestration System

**Primary Constraints Addressed:** Hazardous Material Limits (primary), All Constraints via integrated scheduling (comprehensive)

**Specific Changes Proposed:**

*3a. Real-Time Hazmat Flow Controller:* Implement a digital orchestration layer that maintains a real-time count of hazmat orders in Packing and Quality Check (Hazmat_Active counter). When this counter reaches 8 (two below the regulatory limit), the system:

- Flags the next 2-3 hazmat orders in the Packing queue as "conditional release" — they will be released only as current hazmat orders complete
- Routes incoming non-hazmat orders ahead of these conditional-release hazmat orders at Packing (since there is no regulatory barrier for them)
- Generates alerts for supervisors showing expected time to next hazmat slot opening

This creates a **2-order buffer below the regulatory limit**, ensuring compliance is maintained even under timing uncertainty (e.g., a quality check taking longer than expected) while maximizing hazmat throughput.

*3b. Global Priority Scheduling Matrix:* Replace ad-hoc priority rules with a formalized scheduling matrix that simultaneously considers all constraints. Each order waiting for a resource receives a dynamic priority score:

```
Priority Score = Base_Priority × SLA_Urgency_Factor × Resource_Wait_Penalty × Constraint_Compliance_Factor

Where:
- Base_Priority: Express=10, Standard=1
- SLA_Urgency_Factor: Increases as order approaches its SLA deadline (exponential curve)
- Resource_Wait_Penalty: Increases with time already waited (prevents starvation of standard orders)
- Constraint_Compliance_Factor: Reduces score if dispatching this order would violate hazmat limit or leave batch formation critically short-handed
```

This matrix is recalculated every 5 minutes and governs which order next accesses any shared resource. The **Resource_Wait_Penalty** is a critical addition not in the current process — it ensures that standard orders that have already been waiting 45+ minutes effectively gain priority over newly-arrived express orders (beyond a threshold), preventing indefinite starvation of standard orders during sustained express demand.

*3c. Cross-Constraint Workload Leveling:* Using the predictive demand model from Strategy 1, introduce **workload leveling at Order Received/Item Picking** for hazmat orders during periods when the Packing/QC pipeline is already hazmat-saturated. Specifically, if the predictive model shows that releasing all currently-picking hazmat orders will fill the hazmat limit for the next 2 hours, new hazmat order picking is briefly delayed (maximum 15 minutes) to create a smoother arrival pattern at Packing.

**Data/Analysis Leverage:**

- Real-time event log data  live Hazmat_Active counter and queue monitoring
- Historical activity duration distributions  accurate predictions of when current hazmat orders will complete, enabling precise conditional release timing
- SLA deadline data per order  SLA_Urgency_Factor calculation
- Resource wait time history  calibrate wait penalty curve to prevent starvation while maintaining priority differentiation

**Expected Outcomes:**

- Full regulatory compliance maintained with 99%+ reliability (vs. potential near-misses with current unmonitored approach)
- 20-35% improvement in hazmat order throughput during binding periods (by pre-positioning orders for immediate entry as slots open)
- Significant reduction in standard order starvation events (wait time for standard orders reduced by ~25% due to wait penalty factor)
- Integrated scheduling matrix reduces total number of preemption events by 40% (by anticipating express needs and pre-positioning resources before hard preemption becomes necessary)
- Foundation for future ML-based scheduling optimization as the constraint-aware scoring system generates rich training data on decision outcomes

## Section 4: Simulation and Validation

### Why Simulation is Essential Here

The instance-spanning constraints create complex interdependencies that make analytical estimation unreliable. A change to batching logic affects the hazmat clustering problem; a cold-packing reservation policy affects express order SLA performance. Simulation allows testing of proposed strategies in a controlled environment where all constraints are simultaneously active, at realistic scale, before any operational disruption occurs.

### Building the Simulation Model

**Foundation: Process Mining-Informed Parameterization**

The simulation model is built directly from the event log using the following data-driven parameterization approach:

1. **Activity Duration Distributions:** For each activity at each resource type, fit empirical distributions (not assumed normal — use actual fitted distributions such as log-normal, gamma, or empirical kernel density) from the historical data. Separate distributions are fitted for: cold-pack vs. standard packing, hazmat vs. non-hazmat QC, express vs. standard orders.

2. **Arrival Process Modeling:** Fit non-homogeneous Poisson process parameters for order arrivals, with separate parameters for each hour of day and day of week. Include seasonal multipliers for peak periods. Importantly, fit separate arrival streams for: Standard/Non-Cold/Non-Hazmat, Standard/Cold, Standard/Hazmat, Express/Cold, Express/Non-Cold, etc. (all meaningful attribute combinations).

3. **Routing Logic:** Implement the process flow as discovered by the process mining analysis, including any observed variants (e.g., orders that go directly from Picking to QC without Packing, if such variants exist).

**Specific Instance-Spanning Constraint Modeling (Critical):**

*Resource Contention (Cold-Packing):*
Implement cold-packing stations as shared resources with capacity = 5. Model the proposed reservation policy as a resource partition: 1 unit reserved for express, 4 shared. The simulation engine must enforce true mutual exclusion — only one order per station at a time. The dynamic conversion of standard stations must be modeled as a capacity increase event triggered when the predictive model signals high demand (implemented as a conditional rule in the simulation).

*Batching Logic:*
Implement a batch accumulator for each region with the multi-criteria dispatch triggers from Strategy 2. Orders completing QC enter a batch accumulator; the accumulator releases a batch when size trigger OR time trigger conditions are met. This requires the simulation to track cross-instance state (batch accumulator contents), which is a key requirement distinguishing this from simple single-instance simulation.

*Priority Preemption:*
Implement the "next-in-sequence priority" rule: express orders cannot interrupt active processing, but receive highest priority in the queue. Model this as a priority queue with preemption-at-completion semantics. Compare outcomes against a hard-preemption simulation run to quantify the efficiency difference.

*Hazmat Limit:*
Implement a global semaphore with capacity = 10, acquired at Packing START and released at QC COMPLETE for all hazmat orders. Orders that cannot acquire the semaphore enter a waiting state. The 2-order buffer strategy from Strategy 3 is implemented as a conditional rule: when semaphore count  8, conditional-release orders pause and yield to non-hazmat orders.

**Validation of Simulation Model:**

Before testing optimization strategies, validate the baseline simulation against historical performance:

- Run the simulation with current process logic and historical arrival parameters
- Compare simulated KPIs against historical KPIs: mean/median/90th percentile end-to-end time, throughput per day, SLA compliance rate, cold-packing queue length distribution, batch wait time distribution, hazmat binding event frequency
- Target: simulated KPIs within ±10% of historical actuals across all major metrics

If the baseline model doesn't replicate historical performance, diagnose and correct before testing optimizations. Common issues: arrival rate miscalibration, incorrect resource capacity assumptions, missing routing variants.

**Experimental Design for Strategy Testing:**

Run simulation experiments as a factorial design:

| Experiment | Strategy 1 (Dynamic Cold-Pack) | Strategy 2 (Dynamic Batching) | Strategy 3 (Integrated Scheduling) |
|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Baseline | Off | Off | Off |
| S1 Only | On | Off | Off |
| S2 Only | Off | On | Off |
| S3 Only | Off | Off | On |
| S1+S2 | On | On | Off |
| S1+S3 | On | Off | On |
| S2+S3 | Off | On | On |
| All Three | On | On | On |

Each experiment runs 30+ simulation replications (random seeds) to establish statistical confidence intervals. The full factorial design reveals not just individual strategy effectiveness but interaction effects between strategies — whether they are complementary or create new conflicts.

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

Vary key parameters to understand robustness:
- Arrival rate × 1.5 (peak season stress test)
- Express order proportion increased to 20% (from typical 10%)
- Cold-packing activity duration increased 50% (equipment degradation scenario)
- Batch size trigger varied from 6 to 15 orders

The strategies should remain effective across these variations, not just the average historical case.

**KPIs Tracked in Simulation:**

- End-to-end cycle time (mean, 90th, 99th percentile)
- SLA compliance rate (express and standard separately)
- Cold-packing queue wait time
- Batch wait time
- Hazmat binding events per day
- Resource utilization rates
- Throughput (orders per hour)
- Standard order starvation events (orders waiting >60 minutes for any resource)

## Section 5: Monitoring Post-Implementation

### Continuous Monitoring Architecture

The monitoring system is built on a **real-time process mining platform** that ingests event data from the warehouse management system (WMS) with near-real-time latency (ideally 5 minutes). The monitoring framework has three layers: operational (real-time alerts), tactical (daily/weekly performance dashboards), and strategic (monthly trend analysis).

### Constraint-Specific Monitoring Metrics and Dashboards

- Alert: Any order waiting >25 minutes in batch staging (approaching time trigger threshold)
- Alert: Any express order in batch staging (immediate attention required)

*Daily trend charts:*
- Average BWT (Batch Wait Time) by region: trend line with pre-implementation baseline overlay
- Batch size distribution histogram: are batches being dispatched at appropriate sizes or are they consistently very small (indicating time triggers firing too early) or large (indicating holdups)?
- Batch dispatch reason distribution: % dispatched by size trigger, time trigger, hazmat trigger, express trigger — validates that the logic is working as designed

*Weekly KPI table:*

| Metric | Target | This Week | Baseline |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Mean BWT | 20 min | — | — |
| 90th %ile BWT | 35 min | — | — |

*Daily trend charts:*
- Express order end-to-end cycle time: distribution chart with SLA threshold line
- Express SLA compliance rate (target: >98%)
- Standard order preemption events per day: should trend toward zero as next-in-sequence policy takes effect
- Standard order starvation events per day (orders waiting >60 minutes for any single resource): measure of whether priority handling creates unacceptable delays for standard orders
- Wait Penalty Factor activations: count of orders where wait penalty exceeded standard priority (confirms system preventing starvation)

*Alert:* Express SLA compliance dropping below 95% for any single day  immediate investigation

---

**Dashboard 4: Hazardous Material Compliance and Flow Monitor**

This dashboard serves dual compliance and performance purposes:

*Real-time compliance panel (critical):*
- Live Hazmat_Active counter (large, prominently displayed): current count of hazmat orders in Packing + QC
- Color coding: Green (0-7), Yellow (8-9), Red (10 — limit reached)
- Conditional-release queue: count of hazmat orders waiting for slot (should be small)
- Alert: Hazmat_Active reaching 9  warning; reaching 10  immediate supervisor alert

*Compliance record (for regulatory audit):*
- Log of all moments where Hazmat_Active count hit 10 (should be rare, ideally zero with buffer strategy)
- Compliance attestation report: daily/weekly confirmation that regulatory limit was never exceeded
- Duration of near-limit (8-9 count) periods: should decrease post-implementation

*Performance panel:*
- Hazmat-Induced Wait (HIW) trend: rolling average, target 10 minutes median
- Hazmat throughput rate: hazmat orders processed per hour during peak periods (target: 20% improvement vs. baseline)
- Binding events per day: should trend to near-zero with 2-order buffer strategy

**Dashboard 5: Integrated Process Performance (Executive View)**

*High-level KPIs:*
- Overall order end-to-end time: mean, 90th percentile, by order type
- Overall SLA compliance rate (express: >98%, standard: >92%)
- Daily throughput (orders shipped per day)
- Constraint utilization summary: % of time each constraint is binding

*Decomposed Waiting Time Waterfall:* For a representative sample of orders each week, show the decomposed waiting time breakdown:

```
Total Cycle Time
 Actual Processing Time (value-adding)
 Within-Instance Waiting (non-value-adding, internal)
 Cold-Resource Wait (between-instance)
 Batch Wait (between-instance)
 Priority/Preemption Wait (between-instance)
 Regulatory Wait (between-instance)
```

This waterfall, tracked over time, shows whether between-instance waits are being systematically reduced while within-instance time remains stable (confirming it's the constraint management, not activity performance, that changed).

*Interaction Monitoring:* Track compound events (e.g., orders that experienced BOTH cold-resource wait AND batch wait) — these should become rarer as strategies take effect, confirming that constraint interactions are being broken.

### Continuous Improvement Protocol

The monitoring system is not merely observational — it feeds back into strategy refinement:

**Monthly Review Cycle:**
1. Pull rolling 4-week performance data from all dashboards
2. Compare against simulation-predicted outcomes (from Section 4)
3. Identify any divergences — e.g., if Strategy 2 batch triggers are firing too frequently (small batches, high shipping cost) or too rarely (high BWT), recalibrate triggers based on actual vs. predicted demand patterns
4. Re-run simulation with updated parameters to predict effect of recalibration before applying

**Seasonal Adjustment:**
- 6 weeks before known peak seasons (e.g., holiday season starting early November), run simulation stress tests with peak arrival multipliers
- Pre-adjust resource reservation levels, batch trigger thresholds, and hazmat buffer size based on simulation outputs
- Activate enhanced monitoring (more frequent dashboard refresh, lower alert thresholds) during peak periods

**Anomaly Detection:**
Implement statistical process control (SPC) charts for each key metric. When a metric exceeds its upper control limit (not just its target), it triggers an automated investigation workflow: the process mining system automatically runs a comparison of the current period's event log against the baseline to identify which constraint is newly binding and what changed in the arrival pattern or resource availability to cause it.

## Summary: Strategic Integration

The five-part strategy outlined above forms an integrated optimization system. The analytical foundation (Section 1) rigorously quantifies each constraint's impact using precise event-log decomposition methods. The interaction analysis (Section 2) ensures strategies do not create new problems while solving existing ones. The three strategies (Section 3) address constraints at different levels: resource allocation (Strategy 1), process logic (Strategy 2), and system-wide orchestration (Strategy 3). Simulation (Section 4) provides a risk-free testing environment that explicitly respects the cross-instance dependencies that make this problem complex. And continuous monitoring (Section 5) ensures sustained improvement through feedback loops that track constraint management effectiveness with precision.

The critical thread throughout is the explicit treatment of **between-instance dependencies** as first-class process characteristics — not as anomalies to be averaged away, but as structurally important constraints that require their own data models, metrics, optimization rules, and monitoring indicators. This represents the highest-value application of process mining principles: using event-level data to understand not just how individual cases flow, but how their interactions shape the emergent behavior of the entire fulfillment system.
