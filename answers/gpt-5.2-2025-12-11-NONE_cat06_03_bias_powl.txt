The subtle bias is introduced by the **XOR choice after scoring**:

- Path 1: `…  PreliminaryScoring (C)  CheckLocalAffiliation (D)  …`
- Path 2: `…  PreliminaryScoring (C)  skip  …`

Because **D is optional**, only some applicants receive the *extra processing* that can produce a **score uplift** (“local resident and member of a known community group”). If the uplift increases approval probability or improves offered terms, then the process is effectively:

- “If you have (or can demonstrate) local affiliation, you may get a slightly better outcome than someone with the same underlying creditworthiness.”

That is a form of **procedural preferential treatment** embedded in the workflow: the model explicitly creates a branch where a characteristic unrelated (or only loosely related) to repayment risk can affect the final decision.

### Why this can be biased even if the group is “not legally protected”
Even when “local affiliation” is not a protected class, giving it an incremental advantage can still undermine fairness:

1. **Unequal treatment for equally qualified applicants**  
   Two applicants with the same validated data and preliminary score can receive different outcomes solely because one qualifies for/gets routed to D. That violates a common fairness norm: *similar cases should be treated similarly*.

2. **Proxy discrimination risk**  
   “Local resident” and “known community group” can correlate strongly with protected attributes (race/ethnicity, nationality, religion, socioeconomic status). So an uplift for “locals” can become a **proxy** that indirectly disadvantages outsiders, migrants, or minority communities—even if the system never uses protected attributes explicitly.

3. **Access and documentation asymmetry**  
   Membership in “known community groups” often depends on social capital, stable housing, language proficiency, and familiarity with local institutions. Applicants who are new, transient, or marginalized may be less able to demonstrate affiliation, turning D into an advantage for those already better positioned.

4. **Opacity and contestability**  
   If applicants aren’t told that local affiliation can improve outcomes, those who skip D may never realize they were eligible or disadvantaged. That harms procedural justice (ability to understand and challenge decisions).

### Implications for final decisions (F): fairness and equity impacts
- **Approval rate shifts**: borderline applicants routed through D may be pushed over the approval threshold, while similar borderline applicants without affiliation are rejected.  
- **Terms and pricing disparities**: even if approvals don’t change, small uplifts can translate to better interest rates/limits, compounding wealth inequality.  
- **Systemic exclusion**: over time, “outsiders” (new residents, people without recognized affiliations) may face consistently worse outcomes, reinforcing inequity unrelated to repayment ability.

In short, the XOR branch makes “local affiliation” a *selective benefit channel*. Even if it targets a non-protected group, it can still be unfair (unequal treatment), and it can easily become **indirect discrimination** via correlation with protected characteristics—creating equity issues in the final lending outcomes.
