Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies, here are the main differences in treatment between the 'protected' group (first) and the 'unprotected' group (second):

1. **Expert Examination**: The unprotected group has a significantly higher frequency of expert examinations compared to the protected group:
   - Unprotected: 3597 (sum of frequencies for expert examination)
   - Protected: 648 (sum of frequencies for expert examination)

2. **Thorough Examination**: The unprotected group also undergoes thorough examinations more frequently than the protected group, both as a standalone step and in combination with other steps:
   - Unprotected: 1357 (sum of frequencies for thorough examination)
   - Protected: 489 (sum of frequencies for thorough examination)

3. **Treatment Success Rate**: The unprotected group has a higher treatment success rate compared to the protected group, indicated by the frequency of 'Treatment successful' steps:
   - Unprotected: 5162 (sum of frequencies for treatment successful)
   - Protected: 1478 (sum of frequencies for treatment successful)

4. **Discharge**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of direct discharges without any treatment or with unsuccessful treatments, which might indicate that some cases in the protected group could be resolved through simpler processes:
   - Unprotected: 505 (frequency for 'Discharge' step)
   - Protected: No direct discharge steps mentioned

5. **Process Complexity**: The unprotected group has more complex process variants involving multiple unsuccessful treatments and diagnoses before achieving a successful treatment, as seen in the high frequency of steps like "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment" compared to the protected group.

6. **Performance (Time)**: While not directly related to unfairness, it's worth noting that the performance times are generally higher for the unprotected group, which could indicate longer wait times or more complex treatments:
   - Unprotected: Average performance = 319987.524
   - Protected: Average performance = 260004.254

These differences might suggest that the 'unprotected' group is subject to more thorough and complex examinations, leading to a higher treatment success rate but also longer wait times. However, it's essential to consider other factors and data points to determine if these differences are unfair or simply reflect different needs between the two groups.
