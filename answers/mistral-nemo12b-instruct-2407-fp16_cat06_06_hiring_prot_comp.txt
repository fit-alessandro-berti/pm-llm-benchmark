Based on the provided data, here are the main differences between the patient flows in the Emergency Room (ER) and Fast Track/Urgent Care (FD):

1. **Patient Volume and Frequency:**
   - The ER has a higher overall patient volume. The 'Discharge' event frequency is 505 for ER compared to only 297 for FD.
   - Some specific paths are more frequent in the ER, such as:
     - Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (frequency = 279 vs. FD's 184)
     - Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (frequency = 592 vs. FD's 360)

2. **Expert Examination and Thorough Examination:**
   - The ER performs more expert examinations (frequency = 592 + 102 + 40 = 734) compared to FD (frequency = 360 + 190 + 35 = 575).
   - Similarly, the ER conducts more thorough examinations (frequency = 279 + 97 = 376) than FD (frequency = 184 + 100 = 284).

3. **Treatment Unsuccessful Events:**
   - The ER has a higher frequency of 'Treatment unsuccessful' events, especially after expert examinations and thorough examinations:
     - Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful (frequency = 40) vs. FD's 15
     - Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful (frequency = 97) vs. FD's 29

4. **Multiple Rounds of Diagnosis and Treatment:**
   - The ER has a higher frequency of patient flows involving multiple rounds of diagnosis and treatment before discharge:
     - Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> ... -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (frequency = 40) vs. FD's 35
     - Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> ... -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (frequency = 97) vs. FD's 29

These differences suggest that the ER handles more complex cases, performs more thorough assessments, and deals with a higher volume of patients compared to FD. This is likely due to the ER being designed for severe and immediate medical needs, while FD caters more to less critical urgent care cases.
