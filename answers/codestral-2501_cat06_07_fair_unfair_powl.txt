Sure, let's construct the two POWL models based on the provided description.

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model includes an XOR branch where applicants can either go through a standard cultural fit evaluation or a community affiliation check that gives a subtle advantage.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness check
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Define the XOR choice for cultural fit evaluation
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_check, community_affiliation_check])

# Define the main process flow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, loop, skill_assessment, xor, managerial_review, final_decision])

# Add the order of execution
root.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

# Print the model
print(root)
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model ensures that all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process without any special community-based branch.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness check
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Define the main process flow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, loop, skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check, managerial_review, final_decision])

# Add the order of execution
root.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_check, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

# Print the model
print(root)
```

These models represent the hiring process with and without potential unfairness, respectively. The first model includes an XOR branch that can introduce bias, while the second model ensures a fair evaluation process by removing the selective advantage branch.
