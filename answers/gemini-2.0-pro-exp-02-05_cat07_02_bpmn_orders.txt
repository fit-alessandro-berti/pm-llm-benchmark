This image displays a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 Collaboration diagram, illustrating an order fulfillment process involving four participants represented by pools: **Sales**, **Production**, **Procurement**, and **Warehouse**.

Here's a breakdown of the process flow:

1.  **Sales Pool:**
    *   The process starts on "Monday morning" (timer start event).
    *   Sales first checks the incoming order for completeness.
    *   Then, it checks if the customer already exists in the database.
    *   An exclusive gateway directs the flow:
        *   If the customer is *not* in the database, they are added (interacting with a "database" data store).
        *   If the customer *is* in the database, this step is skipped.
    *   The paths merge, and Sales then sends the "Order details" via message flow to both Production and Procurement.
    *   Sales then waits for a message indicating "Product sent".
    *   Upon receiving this confirmation, Sales drafts the invoice.
    *   The Sales part of the process ends.

2.  **Production Pool:**
    *   The process here starts upon receiving the "Order details" message from Sales.
    *   A parallel gateway splits the flow: Production simultaneously begins to "Plan production" *and* waits for a message confirming "Material not faulty" from Procurement.
    *   Once both planning is done and materials are confirmed okay (synchronized by a joining parallel gateway), Production proceeds to "Manufacture product".
    *   Upon completion, a "Product complete" message is sent to the Warehouse.
    *   The Production flow ends.

3.  **Procurement Pool:**
    *   This process also starts upon receiving the "Order details" message from Sales.
    *   It enters a "Material Compensation Subprocess" where materials are ordered. This task has a timer boundary event (`<d3`); if ordering takes too long, a compensation activity "Return material" is triggered.
    *   After the subprocess, Procurement checks the received materials. This task has an error boundary event; if an error occurs during the check (e.g., materials are faulty), the process terminates via an "Order cancellation" end event.
    *   If the materials check is successful, a "Material not faulty" message is sent to Production.
    *   The main Procurement flow ends.

4.  **Warehouse Pool:**
    *   The process starts upon receiving the "Product complete" message from Production.
    *   The Warehouse performs the task "Send product".
    *   After sending, it sends a "Product sent" message back to Sales.
    *   The Warehouse flow ends.

In summary, this BPMN diagram visualizes a collaborative process where Sales initiates an order, coordinates with Production and Procurement (which handles material acquisition and validation), and finally involves the Warehouse for shipping, before Sales concludes with invoicing. The diagram highlights dependencies, parallel activities, decision points, potential exceptions (timer, error), and communication between different departments.
