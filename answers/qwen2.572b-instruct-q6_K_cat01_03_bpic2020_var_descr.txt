The data you've provided represents a detailed process map for handling declarations, likely in a financial or administrative context within an organization. The process involves multiple stages of submission, approval, rejection, and payment handling, with various roles such as EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, and others involved at different steps. Hereâ€™s a structured description of the underlying process:

### 1. **Initial Submission**
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: This is the starting point where an employee submits a declaration.

### 2. **Approval Stages**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**: The administration reviews and approves the declaration.
   - **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**: In some cases, the budget owner also needs to approve the declaration.
   - **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**: In other variants, a pre-approver is involved in the approval process.

### 3. **Final Approval**
   - **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: The final approval is given by a supervisor.

### 4. **Payment Process**
   - **Request Payment**: After final approval, a request for payment is initiated.
   - **Payment Handled**: The payment is processed and completed.

### 5. **Rejection and Resubmission**
   - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION/BUDGET OWNER/SUPERVISOR/PRE_APPROVER**: At various stages, the declaration can be rejected. If rejected, it goes back to the employee.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**: The employee acknowledges the rejection and may resubmit the declaration.
   - **Resubmission Loop**: The process can loop back to earlier stages if the declaration is resubmitted after being rejected.

### 6. **Special Cases**
   - **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE**: This indicates that an employee has saved a draft of the declaration, but not submitted it yet.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING**: This suggests a special case where a required approval or action is missing, leading to rejection and resubmission.

### Performance Metrics
- **Frequency**: The number of times each variant occurs.
- **Performance (Time in seconds)**: The total time taken for each variant from submission to completion or final state.

### Common Variants
1. **Standard Approval Path**:
   - `SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - This is the most common and efficient path, with a high frequency (4618) and relatively low performance time (810187.903 seconds).

2. **Additional Approval Path**:
   - `SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - This path involves an additional approval step, leading to a slightly higher performance time (1084338.407 seconds) and lower frequency (2473).

3. **Direct Final Approval Path**:
   - `SUBMITTED -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - This path is faster but less frequent, with a performance time of 854633.975 seconds and a frequency of 1392.

### Complex Variants
- **Rejection and Resubmission**:
   - These variants involve multiple rejections and resubmissions, leading to significantly higher performance times and lower frequencies. For example:
     - `SUBMITTED -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (2790977.310 seconds, frequency 29).

### Insights
- **Efficiency**: The standard approval path is the most efficient and frequently used.
- **Bottlenecks**: Complex variants with multiple rejections and resubmissions are less common but take significantly longer to complete, indicating potential bottlenecks in the process.
- **Role Importance**: The roles of ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR, and PRE_APPROVER are crucial at different stages, with their actions directly affecting the performance time.

This structured description should help you understand the flow and dynamics of the declaration handling process within your organization.
