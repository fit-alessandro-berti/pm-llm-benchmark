Sure, I have a series of questions that could help deepen my understanding of your property onboarding process:

1. Can you provide more details on the initial contact with the landlord? What information is typically required at this stage, and how is it recorded?
2. How do you determine which documents are necessary for the property coordinator to verify? Are there standardized checklists or specific criteria that must be met?

7. How often do property inspections reveal issues that need to be addressed? What is the most common type of issue found, and how is it typically resolved?
8. Could you walk me through the steps taken by the property manager to address inspection issues? How do they coordinate with landlords and contractors?
9. What is the process for creating marketing materials once the property passes inspection? Who is involved in this process, and how long does it usually take?
10. How do you keep the online listings and internal pricing models up-to-date with market trends? What tools and data sources are used?
