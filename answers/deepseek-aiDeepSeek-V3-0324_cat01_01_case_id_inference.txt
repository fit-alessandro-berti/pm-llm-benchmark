To group these events into separate cases, we need to look for consistent attributes across events that would logically belong to the same patient journey. The key attributes to consider are `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, and the logical sequence of activities for a given patient. 

Here’s how the events can be grouped into three distinct cases:

### Case 1: 45-year-old male (ER patient)
- **Attributes**: `patient_age: 45`, `patient_gender: M`, `department: ER`
- **Events**:
  1. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: insurance=private`  
  4. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z, activity: Initial triage, resource: Nurse Joy, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: triage_code=3`  
  7. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, resource: Radiology Tech, department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: body_part=left_leg`  
  12. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture`  
  15. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z, activity: Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: followup=outpatient_clinic`  

### Case 2: 62-year-old female (ER patient)
- **Attributes**: `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F`, `department: ER`
- **Events**:
  2. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: insurance=public`  
  5. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z, activity: Initial triage, resource: Nurse Mark, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: triage_code=2`  
  8. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z, activity: Lab test requested, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: test_type=blood_panel`  
  10. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z, activity: Lab test completed, resource: Lab Technician, department: Laboratory, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: results=normal_levels`  
  11. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: diagnosis=minor_infection`  
  14. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z, activity: Prescription created, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: medication=antibiotics`  
  17. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z, activity: Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: followup=pharmacy_pickup`  

### Case 3: 28-year-old male (Surgery patient)
- **Attributes**: `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M`, `department: Surgery`
- **Events**:
  3. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: insurance=private`  
  6. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery`  
  9. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, activity: Surgery preparation, resource: Surgical Nurse, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: prep_type=general_anesthesia`  
  13. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, activity: Surgery performed, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: procedure=arthroscopy`  
  16. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z, activity: Recovery room, resource: Recovery Nurse, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: condition=stable`  
  18. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z, activity: Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: followup=physiotherapy_sessions`  

### Summary of Case Groupings:
- **Case 1**: Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 (45-year-old male, ER)  
- **Case 2**: Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 (62-year-old female, ER)  
- **Case 3**: Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 (28-year-old male, Surgery)  

The grouping is based on the consistency of `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `department`, as well as the logical sequence of activities for each patient (e.g., registration → triage → tests/treatment → discharge). The timestamps also support this grouping, as events for the same patient are interleaved with events for other patients.
