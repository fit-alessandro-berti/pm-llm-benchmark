# Event Log for Process Mining

## Overview and Assumptions

Before presenting the event log, here are my assumptions and methodology:

1. **Case ID**: Using `order_id` as the case identifier
2. **Activity granularity**: Each item pick, delivery, invoice, and payment is treated as a separate event
3. **Resource mapping**: Resource IDs are mapped to names using the Resources table
4. **Order 1004**: Has no delivery, invoice, or payment records — this represents an incomplete/in-progress order
5. **Multiple deliveries/invoices**: When an order has multiple deliveries or invoices, each generates separate events
6. **Chronological ordering**: Events are sorted by Case ID, then by timestamp within each case

## Assumptions Made

1. **Payment Resource**: The Payments table does not include a resource/actor field, so the Payment Received events have no assigned resource (marked as "—").

2. **Order 1004 Incomplete**: Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment records in the source data. This could represent:
   - An order still in progress
   - A cancelled order
   - Missing data
   
3. **Activity Naming**: 
   - "Item Picked" is used instead of "Items Picked" to reflect that each line item picking is a discrete event
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" maintain delivery-level granularity

4. **Chronological Validity**: All timestamps follow logical process flow (Order  Pick  Dispatch  Arrival  Invoice  Payment) for complete orders.

5. **Multiple Deliveries (Order 1002)**: The split shipment scenario is captured with two dispatch and two arrival events, each tied to a specific delivery_id.
