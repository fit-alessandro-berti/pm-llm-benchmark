<think>
We need to write a DuckDB SQL query that does the following: Identify any case (case_id) that contains a direct sequence of three activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' in that order, with no other events in between. Among those cases, filter further where the time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Then exclude those cases from final result. Return all events from event_log except those belonging to cases matching both criteria.

We need to produce a query for DuckDB. We need to ensure we can detect direct succession. Several ways: window functions lead/lag to get previous and next activities sorted by timestamp per case, then filter. Or self-joins. Because we need to ensure direct succession, no events in between. So we need to sort events per case by timestamp, then assign a row_number. Then find triples where activity1 = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', activity2 = 'Create Order', activity3 = 'Confirm Order' and they are consecutive rows (row numbers i, i+1, i+2). Then compute time difference between activity2 and activity3 timestamps; if > 5 days, mark that case as to be excluded.

Thus steps:

1. Create a CTE `ordered_events` that selects case_id, activity, timestamp, row_number() over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as rn.

2. Then create CTE `triples` that join ordered_events to itself to get consecutive triples: join with same case, rn = rn+1 for second, and rn = rn+2 for third.

Or use LAG/LEAD: use lead() to fetch next activity and next after next. Example:

```
SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    lead(activity) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as activity_next,
    lead(activity, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as activity_next2,
    lead(timestamp) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as ts_next,
    lead(timestamp, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as ts_next2
FROM event_log
```

Then filter where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and activity_next = 'Create Order' and activity_next2 = 'Confirm Order'.

Then compute diff = ts_next2 - ts_next; if diff > interval '5 days', then mark case_id to exclude.

We can then use CTE `exclude_cases` that selects distinct case_id from those triples where diff > interval '5 days'.

Finally select * from event_log where case_id not in (select case_id from exclude_cases).

Alternatively, use left join and filter.

We need to ensure correct handling of timestamp differences: DuckDB supports interval and date diff. Use `datediff(day, ts_next, ts_next2)` > 5. Or simply `ts_next2 - ts_next > interval '5 days'`. In DuckDB, we can do `ts_next2 - ts_next > INTERVAL '5 days'`. Or `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ts_next2 - ts_next)) > 5*24*3600`.

Better to use `ts_next2 - ts_next > INTERVAL '5 days'`.

Thus final query:

```
WITH ordered AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        lead(activity) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as act1,
        lead(activity, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as act2,
        lead(timestamp) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as ts1,
        lead(timestamp, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as ts2
    FROM event_log
),
seq_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM ordered
    WHERE
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND act1 = 'Create Order'
        AND act2 = 'Confirm Order'
        AND ts2 - ts1 > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM seq_cases);
```

Potential nuance: The requirement is "these three events must appear in this exact order, with no other event from the same case in between them." Using lead ensures consecutive rows as per timestamp ordering, which ensures no other events between. However, if there are ties (multiple events with same timestamp), they could be considered consecutive but may not be considered direct succession. Usually process logs have timestamps unique per case. We can also add tie-breaker using row_number with ordering by timestamp, maybe also by event ID.

Better to have row_number.

But the above approach is fine.

We need to ensure final query returns all columns. Also need to handle potential performance.

We can use a subquery with `EXCEPT` or `NOT EXISTS`.

Option: Use `NOT EXISTS` rather than `NOT IN` to avoid null issues.

Thus final query:

```
WITH ordered AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        lead(activity) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp, activity) as act_next,
        lead(activity, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp, activity) as act_next2,
        lead(timestamp) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp, activity) as ts_next,
        lead(timestamp, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp, activity) as ts_next2
    FROM event_log
),
exclude_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM ordered
    WHERE
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND act_next = 'Create Order'
        AND act_next2 = 'Confirm Order'
        AND ts_next2 - ts_next > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM exclude_cases ex
    WHERE ex.case_id = e.case_id
);
```

This meets the requirement.

Alternatively, we can use `EXCEPT` but not needed.

We need to ensure proper grouping, ordering, filtering. We can optionally order final result.

Thus final answer: Provide the query.

We might also include explanation.

Thus final answer: Provide the query with explanation.

Now we need to produce final answer: a DuckDB SQL query that does the above.

We should ensure correct handling of timestamp differences > 5 days. Use interval or datediff.

We also need to ensure that we use the correct function for interval.

In DuckDB, interval syntax: `INTERVAL '5' DAY` or `INTERVAL '5 days'`. I think it's `INTERVAL '5 days'`. Or `INTERVAL '5' DAY`. Both may work.

Thus final query:

```
WITH ordered AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        lead(activity) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as next_act,
        lead(activity, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as next2_act,
        lead(timestamp) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as next_ts,
        lead(timestamp, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as next2_ts
    FROM event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM ordered
    WHERE
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_act = 'Create Order'
        AND next2_act = 'Confirm Order'
        AND next2_ts - next_ts > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
LEFT JOIN cases_to_exclude c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
WHERE c.case_id IS NULL;
```

Alternatively using NOT EXISTS.

Thus final answer: Provide query with explanation.

Potential edge cases: Cases where the sequence appears multiple times, but at least one instance meets the time condition -> exclude case. That matches requirement: any case that contains the sequence and time diff >5 days is excluded.

If there are multiple sequences with different times, we need to exclude if any matches >5 days. Using distinct case_id from any matching triple does that.

Thus final query.

Now the final answer: Provide query and explanation.

Also ensure that we mention ordering if needed: the final result can be ordered by case_id, timestamp.

Thus final answer: Provide query.

Now I will write final answer accordingly.

**DuckDB solution**

```sql
-- 1  Order every event inside its case and look ahead two rows
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        "timestamp",
        -- activity of the next event (if any)
        lead(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS act_next,
        -- activity of the event after the next (if any)
        lead(activity,2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS act_next2,
        -- timestamps of the next two events
        lead("timestamp") OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS ts_next,
        lead("timestamp",2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS ts_next2
    FROM event_log
),

-- 2  Find the cases that contain the *exact* threestep pattern
--     and where the gap between step2 and step3 is > 5 days
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM ordered_events
    WHERE
        activity            = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'   -- step 1
        AND act_next        = 'Create Order'                   -- step 2
        AND act_next2       = 'Confirm Order'                  -- step 3
        AND ts_next2 - ts_next > INTERVAL '5 days'            -- timing condition
)

-- 3  Return every row *except* those belonging to the flagged cases
SELECT
    e.*
FROM event_log AS e
LEFT JOIN cases_to_exclude AS x
       ON e.case_id = x.case_id
WHERE x.case_id IS NULL               -- keep only nonmatching cases
-- (optional) order the final result for readability
ORDER BY e.case_id, e."timestamp";
```

### How it works

| Step | What the CTE does | Why it satisfies the requirement |
|------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| **`ordered_events`** | Adds `lead()` columns that give the next two activities **and their timestamps** for each row (ordered by `timestamp` inside each `case_id`). | Because the rows are ordered by time, `lead()` guarantees that the three activities are *consecutive* – there is no other event from the same case in between. |
| **`cases_to_exclude`** | Filters the rows where the threeactivity pattern appears **exactly** (`Approve Purchase Requisition`  `Create Order`  `Confirm Order`) and checks that the time between the second and third event exceeds 5 days (`ts_next2 - ts_next > INTERVAL '5 days'`). `DISTINCT case_id` ensures that a case is flagged even if the pattern occurs only once. | This directly implements the two conditions: (1) the precise sequence without gaps, and (2) the >5day lag between “Create Order” and “Confirm Order”. |
| **Final `SELECT`** | Leftjoins the original log to the list of cases to exclude and keeps only rows where the join fails (`x.case_id IS NULL`). | All events belonging to a case that meets *both* criteria are removed, leaving exactly the events from cases that **do not** meet the criteria. |

### DuckDB notes

* `INTERVAL '5 days'` (or `INTERVAL '5' DAY`) is the native interval syntax.  
* `lead()` works over a `PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp` window, which is efficient in DuckDB.  
* The query returns **all columns** from `event_log`. If you need a subset, replace `e.*` with the desired column list.  

Feel free to add an `ORDER BY` clause (as shown) or additional filters; the core logic stays the same.
