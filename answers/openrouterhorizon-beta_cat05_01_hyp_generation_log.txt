Here are key anomalies in the event log, plausible causes, and SQL queries to investigate each. All queries are PostgreSQL-compatible and target order_event_log, optionally joining orders and resources.

A. Out-of-order or skipped control-flow steps
1) Shipment before prerequisite checks (credit/stock/confirmation)
Observed: case_id 1002 and 1003 show Ship Goods before Perform Credit Check and/or Validate Stock and/or Confirm Shipment.
Why it might happen:
- Policy violations or workarounds (rush/priority orders skipping checks)
- System integration latency or backfilled timestamps
- Training issues or missing enforcement in the workflow engine
- Incorrect activity labeling (e.g., “Ship Goods” logged when actually “Pick Goods”)
SQL investigations:
-- Cases where Ship Goods occurs before Perform Credit Check
WITH firsts AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) AS credit_ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT f.case_id, f.ship_ts, f.credit_ts
FROM firsts f
WHERE f.ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND f.credit_ts IS NOT NULL
  AND f.ship_ts < f.credit_ts
ORDER BY f.case_id;

-- Cases where Ship Goods occurs before Validate Stock
WITH firsts AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) AS stock_ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT f.case_id, f.ship_ts, f.stock_ts
FROM firsts f
WHERE f.ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND f.stock_ts IS NOT NULL
  AND f.ship_ts < f.stock_ts
ORDER BY f.case_id;

-- Cases where Ship Goods occurs before Confirm Shipment
WITH firsts AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT f.case_id, f.ship_ts, f.confirm_ts
FROM firsts f
WHERE f.ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND f.confirm_ts IS NOT NULL
  AND f.ship_ts < f.confirm_ts
ORDER BY f.case_id;

-- Count and rate of such inversions overall
WITH pairs AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) ship_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) credit_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) stock_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Confirm Shipment' THEN timestamp END) confirm_ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND credit_ts IS NOT NULL AND ship_ts < credit_ts) AS ship_before_credit,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND stock_ts IS NOT NULL AND ship_ts < stock_ts) AS ship_before_stock,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND confirm_ts IS NOT NULL AND ship_ts < confirm_ts) AS ship_before_confirm,
  COUNT(*) AS total_cases
FROM pairs;

-- Are inversions concentrated by order_type or value?
WITH pairs AS (
  SELECT o.case_id, o.order_type, o.order_value,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Ship Goods' THEN e.timestamp END) ship_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN e.timestamp END) credit_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Validate Stock' THEN e.timestamp END) stock_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Confirm Shipment' THEN e.timestamp END) confirm_ts
  FROM orders o
  JOIN order_event_log e USING (case_id)
  GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_type, o.order_value
)
SELECT order_type,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND credit_ts IS NOT NULL AND ship_ts < credit_ts) AS ship_before_credit_cnt,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND stock_ts IS NOT NULL AND ship_ts < stock_ts) AS ship_before_stock_cnt,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND confirm_ts IS NOT NULL AND ship_ts < confirm_ts) AS ship_before_confirm_cnt,
       AVG(order_value) FILTER (WHERE ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND credit_ts IS NOT NULL AND ship_ts < credit_ts) AS avg_value_ship_before_credit
FROM pairs
GROUP BY order_type;

2) Missing mandatory steps
Observed: Some cases may lack Perform Credit Check or Validate Stock entirely.
Why it might happen:
- Automations replacing manual steps without logging
- Data loss or event ingestion gaps
- Alternate paths for preapproved customers or prepaid orders
SQL investigations:
-- Which cases are missing key steps
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Perform Credit Check') has_credit,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Validate Stock') has_stock,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Confirm Shipment') has_confirm,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Ship Goods') has_ship
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM steps
WHERE NOT has_credit OR NOT has_stock OR (has_ship AND NOT has_confirm)
ORDER BY case_id;

-- Missing steps by order_type
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT o.case_id, o.order_type,
         BOOL_OR(e.activity='Perform Credit Check') has_credit,
         BOOL_OR(e.activity='Validate Stock') has_stock
  FROM orders o
  LEFT JOIN order_event_log e USING (case_id)
  GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_type
)
SELECT order_type,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT has_credit) AS missing_credit_cnt,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT has_stock) AS missing_stock_cnt,
       COUNT(*) AS total_cases
FROM steps
GROUP BY order_type;

B. Financial sequence anomalies
1) Payment before invoice
Observed: case_id 1004 has Receive Payment before Issue Invoice.
Why it might happen:
- Prepayment policy not reflected in standard flow
- Manual receipt entry before billing due to rush or system lag
- Training or access control issues
SQL investigations:
-- Cases with payment before invoice
WITH times AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS pay_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS inv_ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT case_id, inv_ts, pay_ts
FROM times
WHERE pay_ts IS NOT NULL AND inv_ts IS NOT NULL AND pay_ts < inv_ts
ORDER BY case_id;

-- Payments with no invoice at all
WITH times AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Receive Payment') has_payment,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Issue Invoice') has_invoice
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT case_id
FROM times
WHERE has_payment AND NOT has_invoice;

-- Compare paid amounts vs order_value, and timing deltas
WITH agg AS (
  SELECT e.case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Issue Invoice' THEN e.timestamp END) AS inv_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Receive Payment' THEN e.timestamp END) AS pay_ts,
         MAX(CASE WHEN e.activity='Receive Payment' THEN e.additional_info END) AS pay_info
  FROM order_event_log e
  GROUP BY e.case_id
)
SELECT a.case_id, o.order_value, a.inv_ts, a.pay_ts,
       a.pay_info,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (a.pay_ts - a.inv_ts))/3600 AS hours_pay_after_inv
FROM agg a
JOIN orders o USING (case_id)
WHERE a.pay_ts IS NOT NULL;

C. Logistics confirmation after shipment
Observed: case_id 1003 shows Confirm Shipment after Ship Goods; 1002 confirms before credit/stock.
Why it might happen:
- Using “Confirm Shipment” as post-facto acknowledgment
- Process modeling mismatch (confirmation intended pre-shipment)
- Parallel activities with late logging
SQL investigations:
-- Identify cases where Confirm Shipment occurs after Ship Goods
WITH firsts AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Confirm Shipment' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT case_id, confirm_ts, ship_ts
FROM firsts
WHERE confirm_ts IS NOT NULL AND ship_ts IS NOT NULL AND confirm_ts > ship_ts
ORDER BY case_id;

-- Look at additional_info flags around shipment confirmation
SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp, resource, additional_info
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity IN ('Confirm Shipment','Ship Goods')
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

D. Role/department mismatches
1) Activities performed by unexpected roles or departments
Observed: “Ship Goods” by WarehouseClerk_n (Logistics) seems fine, but check systematically.
Why it might happen:
- Misassigned user accounts or shared logins
- Cross-department overrides during peak times
SQL investigations:
-- Map activities to roles/departments, detect anomalies
WITH act_roles AS (
  SELECT e.activity, r.role, r.department, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM order_event_log e
  LEFT JOIN resources r ON r.resource_id = e.resource
  GROUP BY e.activity, r.role, r.department
)
SELECT *
FROM act_roles
ORDER BY activity, cnt DESC;

-- Events with missing resource metadata or unexpected department by activity
SELECT e.case_id, e.event_id, e.activity, e.timestamp, e.resource, r.department
FROM order_event_log e
LEFT JOIN resources r ON r.resource_id = e.resource
WHERE r.resource_id IS NULL
   OR (e.activity='Perform Credit Check' AND r.department <> 'Finance')
   OR (e.activity='Issue Invoice' AND r.department <> 'Finance')
   OR (e.activity='Receive Payment' AND r.department <> 'Finance')
   OR (e.activity IN ('Validate Stock','Ship Goods','Confirm Shipment') AND r.department <> 'Logistics')
   OR (e.activity='Register Order' AND r.department <> 'Sales')
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.event_id;

E. Throughput time and bottlenecks
1) Unusual delays or extremely fast transitions
Observed: case_id 1004 has immediate payment after order; others have short end-to-end times.
Why it might happen:
- Prepayment flows; automated steps; backdating; clock sync issues
SQL investigations:
-- End-to-end cycle time from Register Order to Receive Payment
WITH times AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Register Order' THEN timestamp END) reg_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) pay_ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT case_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (pay_ts - reg_ts))/3600 AS hours_end_to_end
FROM times
WHERE reg_ts IS NOT NULL AND pay_ts IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY hours_end_to_end;

-- Stage-to-stage durations per case
WITH ev AS (
  SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
  FROM order_event_log
),
t AS (
  SELECT case_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Register Order' THEN timestamp END) AS t_register,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) AS t_credit,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) AS t_stock,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Confirm Shipment' THEN timestamp END) AS t_confirm,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS t_ship,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS t_invoice,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS t_payment
  FROM ev GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT case_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_credit - t_register))/60 AS m_register_to_credit,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_stock - t_credit))/60 AS m_credit_to_stock,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_confirm - t_stock))/60 AS m_stock_to_confirm,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_ship - t_confirm))/60 AS m_confirm_to_ship,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_invoice - t_ship))/60 AS m_ship_to_invoice,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_payment - t_invoice))/60 AS m_invoice_to_payment
FROM t;

F. Data quality: duplicate or conflicting events
Why it might happen:
- Retries, parallel systems, or manual corrections creating duplicates or conflicting timestamps
SQL investigations:
-- Duplicate events by case/activity at same timestamp
SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id, activity, timestamp
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY cnt DESC;

-- Multiple distinct resources performing the same activity first for a case
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, resource,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id, activity ORDER BY timestamp, event_id) AS rn
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY case_id, activity;

G. Policy alignment: priority orders and accelerations
Hypothesis: Priority orders may legitimately bypass some checks or reorder steps.
SQL investigations:
-- Compare anomaly rates by order_type = 'priority' vs others
WITH pairs AS (
  SELECT o.case_id, o.order_type,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Ship Goods' THEN e.timestamp END) ship_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN e.timestamp END) credit_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Validate Stock' THEN e.timestamp END) stock_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Confirm Shipment' THEN e.timestamp END) confirm_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Issue Invoice' THEN e.timestamp END) inv_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity='Receive Payment' THEN e.timestamp END) pay_ts
  FROM orders o
  JOIN order_event_log e USING (case_id)
  GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_type
)
SELECT order_type,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ship_ts < credit_ts) AS ship_before_credit,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ship_ts < stock_ts) AS ship_before_stock,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ship_ts < confirm_ts) AS ship_before_confirm,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE pay_ts < inv_ts) AS pay_before_invoice,
  COUNT(*) AS total_cases
FROM pairs
GROUP BY order_type;

H. Resource-specific patterns
Hypothesis: Certain managers or clerks are associated with early shipment or late confirmation.
SQL investigations:
-- Resources associated with Ship Goods before checks
WITH times AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) ship_ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
shipper AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (case_id)
         case_id, resource AS shipper
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity='Ship Goods'
  ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
),
checks AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) credit_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) stock_ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT s.shipper,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE t.ship_ts < c.credit_ts) AS ship_before_credit_cnt,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE t.ship_ts < c.stock_ts) AS ship_before_stock_cnt,
       COUNT(*) AS total_shipped_cases
FROM times t
JOIN shipper s USING (case_id)
LEFT JOIN checks c USING (case_id)
GROUP BY s.shipper
ORDER BY ship_before_credit_cnt DESC;

I. Content anomalies in additional_info
Hypothesis: Flags like attempted_early=Y, late_confirmation=Y, shipment_scheduled=N correlate with control-flow anomalies.
SQL investigations:
-- Extract and correlate additional_info flags with anomalies
SELECT e.case_id, e.event_id, e.activity, e.timestamp, e.resource, e.additional_info
FROM order_event_log e
WHERE e.additional_info ILIKE '%attempted_early=Y%'
   OR e.additional_info ILIKE '%late_confirmation=Y%'
   OR e.additional_info ILIKE '%shipment_scheduled=N%'
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;

-- Join flags with inversion checks (example for attempted_early=Y)
WITH flags AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE additional_info ILIKE '%attempted_early=Y%'
),
pairs AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) ship_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) credit_ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT p.case_id, p.ship_ts, p.credit_ts, (p.ship_ts < p.credit_ts) AS ship_before_credit
FROM pairs p
JOIN flags f USING (case_id);

Next steps:
- Validate whether policy allows prepayment and shipment-before-check for priority orders; adjust conformance rules accordingly.
- If policies forbid these inversions, implement workflow guardrails (e.g., technical preconditions, role-based checks).
- Address data-quality issues (time sync, idempotent ingestion, consistent activity taxonomy).
- Train/communicate to resources with higher anomaly rates; review access controls and segregation of duties.
