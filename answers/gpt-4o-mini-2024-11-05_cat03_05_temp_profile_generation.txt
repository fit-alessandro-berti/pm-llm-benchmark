Here is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for a global supply chain process in manufacturing high-tech electronics. The dictionary includes pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps, with estimated average times and standard deviations.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 43200),  # 1 day average, 12 hours deviation (supplier lead time)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (172800, 86400),  # 2 days average, 1 day deviation (lead time plus shipping)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (259200, 86400),  # 3 days average, 1 day deviation (lead time + QC wait)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (86400, 43200),   # 1 day average, 12 hours deviation (order processing time)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (129600, 86400),  # 1.5 days average, 1 day deviation (time to get to QC)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 21600),   # 12 hours average, 6 hours deviation (inspection wait time)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 43200),   # 1 day average, 12 hours deviation (assembly preparation time)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200),   # 1 day average, 12 hours deviation (assembly to testing)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 21600),   # 12 hours average, 6 hours deviation (testing to packaging)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 43200),   # 1 day average, 12 hours deviation (packaging to storage)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),  # 3 days average, 1 day deviation (storage to distribution)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 172800), # 1 week average, 2 day deviation (distribution to after-sales support)
    ('SS', 'PK'): (604800, 259200), # 1 week average, 3 days deviation (supplier to packaging)
    ('OP', 'WS'): (345600, 129600), # 4 days average, 1.5 days deviation (order to storage)
    ('RC', 'DT'): (604800, 259200), # 1 week average, 3 days deviation (receive to distribution)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (777600, 259200), # 9 days average, 3 days deviation (inspection to distribution)
    ('CA', 'DT'): (864000, 432000), # 10 days average, 5 days deviation (assembly to distribution)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (777600, 259200), # 9 days average, 3 days deviation (packaging to after-sales support)
    ('DT', 'CA'): (1296000, 604800),# 15 days average, 7 days deviation (distribution to assembly)
}

### Explanation:
- **Activity pairs**: These are chosen based on activities that can eventually follow one another, either directly or after some intermediate steps.
- **Average time**: The estimated average time between pairs of activities, which reflects real-world delays like lead times, processing times, and transport times.
- **Standard deviation**: Reflects the variability in the time between activities due to factors like unexpected delays, production issues, or variability in shipping times.

The time units are in seconds, with common averages representing days or hours. The standard deviations are calculated based on expected variations in each process step.
