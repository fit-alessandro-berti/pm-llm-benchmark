Below is an analysis of the two models with respect to what one would expect for a normative Hire-to-Retire process, followed by a conclusion on which is closer to that ideal.

  
1. Analysis of Model 1

•Sequence of steps:  
– The activities are defined as: Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  {Make_Hiring_Decision, Conduct_Interviews}  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case.  
– There is a clear chain for most of the process (the later steps “Onboard_Employee”, “Add_to_Payroll”, and “Close_Case” are ordered correctly).  

•Identified anomaly:  
– After “Screen_Candidates,” two outgoing edges lead to both “Make_Hiring_Decision” and “Conduct_Interviews.” This means that the process does not force one to conduct the interviews before making a hiring decision. In a normative process, you would expect that a hiring decision is taken only after the interviews have been conducted.  
– Although the essential activities are present and none are omissible, the partial order leaves the relative ordering of “Conduct_Interviews” and “Make_Hiring_Decision” ambiguous. This could result in a scenario where the hiring decision is made before the interviews occur—a deviation from the usual good practice.

  
2. Analysis of Model 2

•Sequence of steps:  
– The model again lists the usual activities (posting, screening, interviewing, deciding, onboarding, payroll, and closing) but introduces two operators:
 A LOOP operator (“loop_onboarding”) around the “Onboard_Employee” activity, and  
 An XOR operator (“xor_payroll”) that chooses between “Add_to_Payroll” or a silent (skip) transition.
  
•Identified anomalies:  
– Ordering anomaly: There is an edge from “Post_Job_Ad” to both “Screen_Candidates” and “Conduct_Interviews,” meaning that interviews can start in parallel with or even before screening. Normatively, screening should precede interviewing to ensure that only qualified candidates are interviewed.  
– Loop structure on onboarding: The loop operator (with “Onboard_Employee” and a skip option) could imply repeated onboarding or even the possibility of looping without proper exit conditions. Onboarding is usually a onetime event and should not be treated as a repetitive activity.  
– Optional payroll: The XOR operator makes “Add_to_Payroll” optional. In a normative Hire-to-Retire process, adding the new hire to the payroll is an essential step and should not be skippable through a silent transition.

  
3. Which Model Is Closer to the Normative Process?

Model 1 retains all the essential steps, and at least the overall flow resembles the traditional sequence—even though the ordering between “Conduct_Interviews” and “Make_Hiring_Decision” is not strictly enforced. In contrast, Model 2 not only presents an ordering issue (by allowing interviews to potentially occur before screening) but also structurally permits the skipping (or repetition) of very important activities (onboarding and payroll).

•Impact on Process Correctness and Integrity:  
– In Model 1, the anomaly is limited to a potential mis-sequencing between interviews and decision making. While this is significant (as a hiring decision is normally made after interviewing), it does not allow for the complete omission of any critical steps.  
– Model 2’s design allows for the possibility that crucial steps might be bypassed (e.g., skipping the payroll addition altogether or altering the onboarding step due to its loop structure). This not only deviates from the standard process but could also lead to a fundamentally flawed implementation of the Hire-to-Retire logic.

  
Conclusion

Model 1 more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process. Even though it does not fully enforce that interviews occur before the hiring decision, all essential steps are preserved, and none can be skipped. Model 2, on the other hand, introduces multiple structural deviations (concurrent screening and interviewing, looping of onboarding, and optional payroll inclusion) that more severely violate the process integrity expected from a standard Hire-to-Retire workflow.
