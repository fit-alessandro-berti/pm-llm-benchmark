The primary difference between the two data sets in this comparison is their usage context and target populations.

1. The first set of data focuses on renting processes, including viewing appointments, property inspections, contracts, rent payments, and tenant cancellations for apartments or other rental units.

2. The second dataset represents different applications from a group that may not necessarily be specifically interested in the housing sector. It includes applications related to viewing properties, rejecting prospective tenants, moving in, paying rent, tenant cancellations, etc.

3. From a general perspective, the first set is more focused on rental transactions and their various steps, which could include everything from initial contact to termination of a lease. The second dataset, while it overlaps with many of these aspects, might also cover other types of applications not typically associated directly with property rentals, such as those involving student housing, shared accommodations, or vacation homes.

In terms of target populations, the first set likely targets individuals or businesses interested in renting properties, whereas the second set targets a broader range of entities who may need to deal with related rental-related activities.
