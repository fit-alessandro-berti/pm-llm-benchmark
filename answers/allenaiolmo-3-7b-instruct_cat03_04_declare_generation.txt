Below is an example of how you might construct a `pm4py`-style **DECLARE model** as a Python dictionary for the described multi-department product launch process.  
I will include **all required keys** and provide example entries for some of the activities, using **support = 1.0** (since the prompt specifies this for the base rules) and plausible **confidence values** for demonstration.  
For brevity, I’ll include a few key activities per rule type, but you can extend the dictionary as needed for your specific data.

```python
from copy import deepcopy

# Activity names
activities = [
    'Idea Generation (IG)', 
    'Design Draft (DD)', 
    'Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)', 
    'Cost Evaluation (CE)', 
    'Prototype Creation (PC)', 
    'Laboratory Testing (LT)', 
    'User Testing (UT)', 
    'Approval Gate (AG)', 
    'Marketing Plan (MP)', 
    'Final Launch (FL)'
]

# DECLARE model structure
declare_model = {
    # Existence rules: which activities must always happen together
    'existence': {
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.95},
        'DD': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.98},
        'TFC': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.92},
        'CE': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.97},
        'PC': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.90},
        'LT': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.89},
        'UT': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.93},
        'AG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.96},
        'MP': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.91},
        'FL': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.94}
        # Add more combinations as needed (e.g., IG -> DD -> TFC)
    },
    'absence': {},  # You may define absence rules if needed (empty for demo)
    'exactly_one': {},  # Optional, e.g., only one of X or Y can happen
    'init': {  # Initial activity
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.99}
    },
    # Responded existence: e.g., if IG exists, then DD must exist (as an example)
    'responded_existence': {
        'DD': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.99},  # after IG
        # Or: 'DD': {'support': ...}, 'TFC': {...}, etc.
    },
    'coexistence': {  # e.g., TFC and LT must both happen before FL
        'FL': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.97},
        # or combinations like 'TFC' and 'LT' together before 'FL'
    },
    'response': {  # e.g., after AG, then MP must happen
        'MP': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.95}
    },
    'precedence': {  # e.g., IG -> DD (if IG occurs, DD must follow)
        'DD': {'parent': 'IG', 'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.97}
    },
    'succession': {  # e.g., after DD, TFC can occur
        'TFC': {'parent': 'DD', 'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.96}
    },
    'altresponse': {},  # Alternative responses (if any)
    'altprecedence': {}, # Alternative precedences
    'altsuccession': {},# Alternative successions
    'chainresponse': {}, # Sequential chain of responses
    'chainprecedence': {},# Sequential precedences
    'chainsuccession': {},# Sequential successions
    'noncoexistence': {}, # Activities that cannot happen together (e.g., FL and PC)
    'nonsuccession': {}, # Activities that cannot succeed each other (e.g., AG then FL)
    'nonchainsuccession': {}, # Non-sequential conflict
}

# Optional: You can extend the dictionary with more specific rules based on your process knowledge
# For example, a rule that after User Testing (UT), Approval Gate (AG) must follow:
# 'succession': {
#     'AG': {'parent': 'UT', 'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.99}
# }

# The above structure demonstrates the required keys and structure per your prompt.
```

### **Explanation of the Structure**

- **Existence:** Lists mandatory combinations of activities (e.g., all required steps must be performed).
- **Precedence/Succession:** Defines which activities must come before or after others (e.g., `DD` can only occur after `IG`).
- **Coexistence/Noncoexistence:** Activities that must or must not occur together.
- **Response/Chainresponse:** Models reactions to events (e.g., after approval, marketing begins).
- **Support/Confidence:** Set to 1.0 for base support (as per prompt), but you can adjust confidence based on your data.
- **You can add as many activity entries as you have relevant rules.**

### **How to Use in pm4py**

Once you have this dictionary, you can convert it to a `Model` object using `pm4py.models DECLARE` by passing the dict (after converting types if needed, as pm4py may require a specific structure).

**Note:**  
You should tailor the values (supports, confidences, and the actual keys) to your real data and process understanding. This template gives you a solid starting point for your manufacturing product launch process.

Let me know if you want a more **specifically populated example** (with real data values or more detailed rules)!
