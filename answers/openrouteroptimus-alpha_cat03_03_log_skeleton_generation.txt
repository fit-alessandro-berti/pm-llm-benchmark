Here's a detailed Log Skeleton for the **Order Fulfillment** process described. The constraints are chosen to reflect a **typical, strict order fulfillment process**, where, for example, certain steps logically precede others, must always happen together, or have activity frequency restrictions.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # If the first activity occurs, it has the same number of occurrences as the second one.
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'IC'),         # Every order received should result in one invoice.
        ('PO', 'GSL'),        # Every packed order gets a shipping label.
        ('D', 'PO'),          # Every dispatched order must have been packed.
    },

    # If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have happened previously.
    'always_before': {
        ('RI', 'CA'),         # Can't reserve until availability is checked.
        ('PI', 'RI'),         # Can't pick until reserved.
        ('QC', 'PI'),         # Can't check quality before picking.
        ('PO', 'QC'),         # Can't pack before quality check.
        ('GSL', 'PO'),        # Can't generate shipping label before packing.
        ('D', 'GSL'),         # Can't dispatch before label is generated.
        ('RP', 'IC'),         # Can't record payment before invoicing.
    },

    # If the first activity occurs, the second follows at some future point within the case.
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),         # Checking availability must follow order reception.
        ('CA', 'RI'),         # Reserve must follow availability.
        ('RI', 'PI'),         # Pick must follow reservation.
        ('PI', 'QC'),         # Quality check must follow picking.
        ('QC', 'PO'),         # Packing follows quality check.
        ('PO', 'GSL'),        # Label follows packing.
        ('GSL', 'D'),         # Dispatch follows label.
        ('IC', 'RP'),         # Payment is eventually recorded after invoice.
    },

    # Pairs of activities that cannot co-exist in the same case.
    # (Here, none—assuming all activities should be in each order lifecycle;
    # but if e.g., failed QC returns order to start, you could add constraints)
    'never_together': set(),

    # Activity occurrences. Most activities happen only once per order.
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {1},
    },

    # Directly-follows: If the first occurs, the second occurs immediately after.
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('IC', 'RP'),
    },
}
```

### **Explanation**

- **Equivalence:**  
  - Each order received results in an invoice – (`RO`, `IC`)
  - Each pack operation matches a shipping label – (`PO`, `GSL`)
  - Each packed order is dispatched – (`PO`, `D`)
- **Always Before:**  
  - Enforces the required process order (e.g., must check before reserving).
- **Always After:**  
  - Ensures that certain steps always happen after a given activity (e.g., payment after invoice).
- **Never Together:**  
  - Empty: All activities are part of the standard process.
- **Activity Occurrences:**  
  - Each activity expected once per order/case.
- **Directly-Follows:**  
  - Encodes the strict sequential flow between each adjacent activity.

**If you need to allow for exceptions or variations—like skipped Quality Check, or multiple payments—you can adapt `activ_freq` or add more to `never_together`.**
