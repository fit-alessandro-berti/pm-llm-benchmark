The figure you’ve provided is actually a composite of three related sub-views, labeled (a), (b) and (c), which together illustrate how two “proclet” classes (Lab visit and Lab test) interact via message-passing channels, how they relate structurally, and what a single message (“performative”) might look like in tabular form.

1. Subfigure (a): Two proclet classes connected through two channels  
   • Left side (“Lab visit” proclet):  
     – Swimlanes for two roles: doctor (top) and lab assistant (below).  
     – Activities in sequence:  
       1. Order entry (performed by doctor)  
       2. Take blood sample (performed by lab assistant)  
       3. Receive result (lab assistant)  
       4. Judge results (lab assistant) – this decision point branches to either “Everything fine” or “Do tests again.”  
       5. If “Everything fine,” proceed to Send report (lab assistant) and terminate.  
       6. If “Do tests again,” loop back via the same channels to request repeated testing and then Receive updated result, before eventually sending the report.  
   • Right side (“Lab test” proclet):  
     – Single swimlane for chemical analyst.  
     – Activities in sequence:  
       1. Perform test  
       2. Make report  
       3. Finish lab test (join node)  
       4. If a retest is requested (loop), Perform test again and Provide updated report, then finish.  
   • Communication channels (dashed boxes):  
     – Order system channel: directed from Lab visit’s “Take blood sample” to Lab test’s “Perform test.” Multiplicity on both ends is “1..1” (exactly one message per test request).  
     – HIS (Hospital Information System) channel: directed back from Lab test’s “Make report” to Lab visit’s “Receive result.” Lower branch carries repeated-test messages similarly. Multiplicities “1..*” on the Lab visit side reflect that a visit may receive one or more results, and “1..1” on the Lab test side that each report is sent exactly once per test.  

2. Subfigure (b): Class diagram containing the two proclet classes  
   • Two UML-style classes:  
     – Lab visit  
     – Lab test  
   • Association between them labeled “requires,” with multiplicities:  
     – From Lab visit to Lab test: 1..* (each visit requires one or more tests)  
     – From Lab test back to Lab visit: 1..1 (each test belongs to exactly one visit)  

3. Subfigure (c): Example of a performative (message)  
   A single-row table showing how a concrete message in this framework might be recorded:  
   • Time: 11:00  
   • Channel: Order system  
   • Sender: Lab visit – John  
   • Receiver(s): Lab test – John  
   • Action (performative type): Create  
   • Content: “Can you perform a HGB test for John?”  
   • Scope: Private  
   • Direction: OUT (indicating an outbound message)

Taken together, these three views show (a) the dynamic interaction of two collaborating processes via message channels, (b) their static class-level relationship, and (c) the schema of an individual inter-proclet message.
