Each process step also shows the time taken (in milliseconds) and the overall number of objects processed. The diagram visually represents how these items move through various stages, showing the interaction and transition between different processes. The arrows indicate the direction of flow and the time taken for each transition, providing a detailed view of the process efficiency and bottlenecks. The main message of the diagram is to illustrate the workflow and processing times for different types of items in a procurement and order management system.
