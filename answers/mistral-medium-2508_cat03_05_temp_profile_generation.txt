Here’s a Python dictionary representing the **temporal profile** for the global supply chain process, with estimated average times and standard deviations for pairs of activities that may eventually follow each other (including non-adjacent pairs). The values are in **seconds** and are based on realistic assumptions about supply chain timelines (e.g., procurement delays, manufacturing lead times, testing durations, etc.).

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected pairs (common sequences)
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 21600),       # 1 day avg (±6 hours) for supplier selection  order placement
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 172800),     # 7 days avg (±2 days) for order placement  receiving components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 1800),         # 1 hour avg (±30 mins) for receiving  inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 7200),        # 4 hours avg (±2 hours) for inspection  assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 10800),       # 6 hours avg (±3 hours) for assembly  testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 3600),         # 2 hours avg (±1 hour) for testing  packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800),         # 1 hour avg (±30 mins) for packaging  warehouse storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 86400),      # 2 days avg (±1 day) for storage  distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800),    # 30 days avg (±7 days) for distribution  after-sales support

    # Non-adjacent but eventually following pairs (skipping intermediate steps)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (691200, 180000),     # ~8 days avg (±2 days) for supplier selection  receiving components
    ('SS', 'QI'): (694800, 181800),     # ~8.05 days avg (±2.1 days) for SS  QI
    ('OP', 'QI'): (608400, 173400),     # ~7.02 days avg (±2 days) for OP  QI
    ('OP', 'CA'): (622800, 175800),     # ~7.2 days avg (±2 days) for OP  CA
    ('RC', 'PT'): (28800, 14400),       # 8 hours avg (±4 hours) for RC  PT
    ('RC', 'PK'): (36000, 18000),       # 10 hours avg (±5 hours) for RC  PK
    ('QI', 'PT'): (21600, 10800),       # 6 hours avg (±3 hours) for QI  PT (same as CAPT if no delays)
    ('QI', 'WS'): (43200, 21600),       # 12 hours avg (±6 hours) for QI  WS
    ('CA', 'WS'): (28800, 14400),       # 8 hours avg (±4 hours) for CA  WS
    ('PT', 'DT'): (176400, 88200),      # ~2 days avg (±1 day) for PT  DT (includes packaging/storage)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (2628000, 604800),    # ~30.4 days avg (±7 days) for PK  AS

    # Long-range dependencies (e.g., early steps to late steps)
    ('SS', 'PT'): (715200, 183600),     # ~8.2 days avg (±2.1 days) for SS  PT
    ('SS', 'DT'): (885600, 216000),     # ~10.2 days avg (±2.5 days) for SS  DT
    ('OP', 'DT'): (781200, 205200),     # ~9 days avg (±2.4 days) for OP  DT
    ('RC', 'DT'): (190800, 95400),      # ~2.2 days avg (±1.1 days) for RC  DT
    ('QI', 'DT'): (187200, 93600),      # ~2.2 days avg (±1.1 days) for QI  DT
    ('SS', 'AS'): (3412800, 777600),    # ~40 days avg (±9 days) for SS  AS
    ('OP', 'AS'): (3326400, 756000),    # ~38.5 days avg (±8.7 days) for OP  AS
}
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Procurement Delays (`SS``OP``RC`)**:
   - Supplier selection to receiving components (`SS``RC`) takes ~8 days on average, with high variability due to supplier lead times.
   - Order placement to receipt (`OP``RC`) dominates this delay (~7 days).

2. **Manufacturing Flow (`RC``QI``CA``PT`)**:
   - Inspection (`QI`) and assembly (`CA`) are relatively fast (~1–6 hours), but cumulative delays can add up.
   - Testing (`PT`) may introduce bottlenecks if issues are found.

3. **Logistics and Distribution (`PK``WS``DT`)**:
   - Warehouse storage (`WS`) to distribution (`DT`) takes ~2 days, reflecting batching/shipping schedules.
   - Distribution to after-sales (`DT``AS`) has a long tail (~30 days), accounting for customer usage before support is needed.

4. **Long-Range Dependencies**:
   - Early steps like `SS` or `OP` can influence late steps (e.g., `SS``AS` spans ~40 days).
   - Variability increases for long-range pairs due to compounded uncertainties.

5. **Standard Deviations**:
   - Higher for external dependencies (e.g., `OP``RC`) or long-range pairs.
   - Lower for internal, controlled steps (e.g., `RC``QI`).

### Usage Example:
To check if a deviation occurs for a given `ZETA` (e.g., `ZETA = 2`):
```python
def is_deviation(pair, observed_time, zeta=2):
    avg, stdev = temporal_profile.get(pair, (0, 0))
    lower_bound = avg - zeta * stdev
    upper_bound = avg + zeta * stdev
    return observed_time < lower_bound or observed_time > upper_bound

# Example: Check if OPRC took 10 days (864000 seconds) with ZETA=2
print(is_deviation(('OP', 'RC'), 864000))  # True (upper bound is ~604800 + 2*172800 = 950400)
```

This profile can be refined with real event log data, but the estimates above capture realistic supply chain dynamics.
