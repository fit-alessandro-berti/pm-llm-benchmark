### Step 1: Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

First, let's calculate the total resolution time for each case:

- **Case 101:** 
  - Received: 2024-03-01 08:00
  - Closed: 2024-03-01 10:15
  - Total Time: 2 hours 15 minutes (~135 minutes)

- **Case 102:** 
  - Received: 2024-03-01 08:05
  - Escalated: 2024-03-01 11:30
  - Investigated: 2024-03-01 14:00
  - Resolved: 2024-03-02 09:00
  - Closed: 2024-03-02 09:15
  - Total Time: 18 hours 10 minutes (~1090 minutes)

- **Case 103:** 
  - Received: 2024-03-01 08:10
  - Closed: 2024-03-01 09:30
  - Total Time: 1 hour 20 minutes (~80 minutes)

- **Case 104:** 
  - Received: 2024-03-01 08:20
  - Closed: 2024-03-02 08:30
  - Total Time: 23 hours 10 minutes (~1390 minutes)

- **Case 105:** 
  - Received: 2024-03-01 08:25
  - Escalated: 2024-03-02 14:00
  - Investigated: 2024-03-03 09:00
  - Resolved: 2024-03-03 09:30
  - Closed: 2024-03-03 09:30
  - Total Time: 30 hours 5 minutes (~1805 minutes)

From these calculations, cases **102**, **104**, and **105** have significantly longer resolution times compared to the average.

### Step 2: Determine Potential Root Causes

#### Case 102:
- **Escalation:** The ticket was escalated to a Level-2 Agent, which should have taken less time. However, the delay in escalation and the subsequent long investigation time likely contributed to the overall delay.
- **Long Investigation Time:** The investigation took a long time (from 11:30 to 14:00 on the same day, and then from 14:00 the next day to 9:00 the following day). This delay could be due to the nature of the issue or insufficient resources from the Level-1 Agent.

#### Case 104:
- **Long Investigation Time:** The investigation phase took an unusually long time (from 9:30 to 13:00 on the same day, and then again from 13:00 to 8:00 the next day). This delay could be attributed to the complexity of the issue or resource constraints.
- **Extended Closure:** The ticket was closed after a significant delay, which further extended the resolution time.

#### Case 105:
- **Escalation and Re-investigation:** The ticket was escalated to a Level-2 Agent but took a long time to do so (11:30 to 14:00 on the same day). After escalation, it was investigated again, taking more time (14:00 to 9:00 the next day, and then again from 9:00 to 9:30 the following day). This multiple-stage escalation and re-investigation likely contributed to the significant delay.

### Step 3: Insights and Recommendations

#### 1. **Efficient Escalation Process:**
   - Ensure that the escalation process is streamlined. Escalations should not cause unnecessary delays. Designate clear protocols and criteria for when escalation is necessary and when it is not. Reduce the time taken to escalate and ensure that the escalated team is promptly assigned.

#### 2. **Incentivize Timely Resolution:**
   - Implement performance metrics that reward agents for timely resolution. This can encourage agents to focus on resolving tickets more quickly and efficiently, reducing the likelihood of delays.

#### 3. **Resource Allocation:**
   - Assess the availability and efficiency of Level-1 and Level-2 Agents. Ensure that Level-1 Agents have the necessary skills and resources to handle the majority of tickets. For complex issues, ensure that Level-2 Agents are available and can respond promptly.

#### 4. **Investigation Process Optimization:**
   - Simplify and standardize the investigation process. Provide clear guidelines and checklists for agents to follow, reducing the likelihood of unnecessary delays. Use automation where possible to streamline repetitive tasks.

#### 5. **Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - Implement real-time monitoring systems to track ticket status, resolution times, and performance metrics. Regularly review reports to identify trends and patterns, and address any issues that arise.

By addressing these factors, the support team can reduce the likelihood of delays and improve overall performance.
