Here’s a well-drafted prompt for the benchmark:

**Benchmark Draft Prompt:**

"You are tasked with analyzing an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`. Each row in the table corresponds to a single event. The table includes the following key columns: `case_id` (which groups events belonging to the same process instance), `activity` (describing the action or step performed), and `timestamp` (recording the event's occurrence).

Your objective is to:

1. Identify how many events are associated with each `case_id`.
2. Exclude any `case_id` where the total number of events exceeds six.
3. Return the full details of the events that remain after filtering.

Write a DuckDB SQL query to achieve this. Ensure the query correctly groups events by `case_id`, applies the appropriate filtering criteria, and returns the filtered set of events for each valid case. The output should include all columns (`case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`) for the final set of cases with six or fewer events."

This version emphasizes clarity and provides enough guidance while leaving room for SQL expertise.
