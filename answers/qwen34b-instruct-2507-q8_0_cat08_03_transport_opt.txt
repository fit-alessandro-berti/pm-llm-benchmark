# **Comprehensive Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Operations**

---

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

### **Data Preprocessing and Integration into a Cohesive Event Log**

To perform effective process mining, the heterogeneous data from GPS trackers, driver scanners, dispatch systems, and maintenance logs must be integrated into a unified, structured event log. This requires careful preprocessing and alignment of data streams.

#### **Step-by-Step Integration Strategy:**

1. **Event Standardization:**
   - Each source generates events with different attributes. We define a **common event schema** with consistent fields:
     - `Case ID` (e.g., `V12-20241205`) — uniquely identifies a vehicle-day operation.
     - `Activity` (e.g., *Start Shift*, *Arrive Customer*, *Delivery Success*, *Unscheduled Stop*, *Route Assigned*) — represents discrete process steps.
     - `Timestamp` — precise time of occurrence (critical for time-based analysis).
     - `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Package ID`, `Location (Lat/Lon)` — for spatial and contextual linkage.
     - `Duration` (calculated as time difference between consecutive events) — enables performance analysis.
     - `Status/Outcome` (e.g., *Success*, *Failed*, *Maintenance Required*) — for filtering and classification.

2. **Temporal Alignment:**
   - Use the **timestamps** to align events across systems. For example:
     - A GPS "Low Speed Detected" at 08:10:55 and a scanner "Arrive Customer" at 08:25:10 can be linked to the same case.
   - Handle time zone inconsistencies and daylight saving adjustments.
   - Apply **time window constraints** (e.g., only include events within a 5-minute buffer of the next expected event) to reduce noise and false linkages.

3. **Case Construction:**
   - Group events by `Case ID` to create a **case log** where each row represents an event in a single delivery day.
   - Ensure that **all process activities are ordered chronologically** within each case using timestamp sorting.

4. **Handling Missing Data and Gaps:**
   - Use imputation or gap analysis to identify missing activities (e.g., a "Depart Customer" missing after a "Delivery Success").
   - Flag gaps longer than 30 minutes as potential anomalies (e.g., driver idle time, unrecorded stops).

#### **Challenges Encountered:**

- **Data Granularity Mismatch:** GPS data may be sampled every 30 seconds, while scanner events are discrete. This requires interpolation or aggregation to maintain temporal continuity.
- **Event Misalignment:** A "Route Assigned" dispatch event may occur before the driver starts moving; this can create a "ghost" activity if not properly linked.
- **Missing Events:** Some activities (e.g., "Depart Depot") might be missing due to system errors or manual entry. These can be flagged for investigation.
- **Duplicate Events:** Multiple GPS points may occur at the same location during a stop; clustering or deduplication is needed to avoid overcounting.

#### **Process Discovery: Visualizing the Actual Delivery Process**

Using **process discovery algorithms** such as **Alpha, Heuristics, or Inductive Miner**, we generate a *discovered process model* that reflects the actual flow of deliveries over time.

- **Model Output:** A **Petri net or activity diagram** showing:
  - The sequence of activities (e.g., *Start Shift  Route Assigned  Depart Depot  [Sequence of Arrive/Depart Customer]  Delivery Success/Failure  Return to Depot  End Shift*).
  - Branching paths for failed deliveries or unscheduled stops.
  - Loops (e.g., re-delivery attempts after failed attempts).
  - Variants (e.g., different paths based on customer type, time of day, or traffic).

- **Key Insights from Discovery:**
  - Identification of **unplanned deviations** (e.g., a driver stopping at a non-planned location due to traffic or customer issues).
  - Detection of **repeated patterns** (e.g., "After 3 stops, 20% of deliveries fail due to customer absence").
  - Exposure of **missing or skipped activities** (e.g., "No 'Depart Customer' after 'Arrive Customer'").

#### **Conformance Checking: Comparing Actual vs. Planned**

Conformance checking evaluates how closely the actual process aligns with the **planned routes** from the dispatch system.

- **Method:** Use **alignment-based algorithms** (e.g., in ProM, Disco, or Celonis) to:
  - Map the actual sequence and duration of events to the expected sequence defined in the dispatch plan.
  - Calculate **conformance scores** (e.g., % of events matching planned path, % of deviations).

- **Types of Deviations to Investigate:**

| Deviation Type | Example | Impact |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Sequence Deviations** | Driver visits Stop 5 before Stop 3 (not in planned order) | Indicates poor route planning or dynamic routing failure |
| **Unplanned Stops** | Driver stops at a location not in the route (e.g., for fuel or customer not home) | Increases travel time, fuel consumption, and risk of missed windows |
| **Timing Deviations** | Arrival at Stop 1 delayed by >15 minutes vs. planned time | Reduces on-time delivery rate |
| **Missing Activities** | No "Delivery Success" after "Arrive Customer" | Indicates failed deliveries or data gaps |
| **Premature End Shift** | Driver ends shift early without completing all deliveries | Underutilization of vehicle capacity |

- **Visualization:** A **conformance heatmap** can show which drivers, vehicles, or routes have the highest deviation rates — enabling targeted interventions.

>  *Conclusion:* Process discovery reveals the *real* delivery process, while conformance checking exposes gaps between planning and reality — critical for identifying inefficiencies.

## **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

To evaluate delivery performance and operational cost, we define and calculate the following KPIs from the event log:

| KPI | Formula / Calculation | Relevance |
|-----|------------------------|---------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | (# of deliveries completed within customer time window) / (Total deliveries) × 100% | Directly impacts customer satisfaction |
| **Average Time per Delivery Stop** | (Time between "Arrive Customer" and "Depart Customer") / (Total stops) | Measures service efficiency; high values indicate long dwell times |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio** | (Total travel time) / (Total service time) | Indicates if vehicles spend more time driving than interacting with customers |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/package** | (Estimated fuel used) / (Total km driven) | Links to operational cost; can be derived from GPS speed and distance |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | (Total distance driven / Total possible distance) × 100% | Identifies underused or overused vehicles |
| **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays** | % of time where speed < 10 km/h (e.g., "Low Speed Detected") or time > 10 min delay | Highlights congestion hotspots |
| **Rate of Failed Deliveries** | (# of failed deliveries) / (Total deliveries attempted) × 100% | Drives re-delivery costs and customer dissatisfaction |

>  *Note:* Fuel consumption can be estimated using speed profiles and distance (e.g., via GPS trajectory) and correlated with vehicle type and load.

### **Bottleneck Identification Using Process Mining Techniques**

We apply **process mining** to pinpoint where delays and inefficiencies occur:

1. **Activity Duration Analysis:**
   - Calculate average, median, and variance of durations for each activity (e.g., "Arrive Customer", "Dwell Time").
   - Identify long-tailed distributions (e.g., 20% of stops take 4x longer) — these are likely bottlenecks.
   - **Example:** High dwell time at "Arrive Customer" suggests poor customer communication or parking issues.

2. **Variants and Route Performance Comparison:**
   - Group cases by route, driver, or time of day.
   - Use **variant analysis** (e.g., via Alpha or Heuristics Miner) to compare performance across routes.
   - Identify routes with:
     - High failure rates.
     - Long travel times.
     - Frequent traffic delays.
   - **Example:** Route R-4 has 30% failed deliveries due to customer absence — a clear bottleneck.

3. **Time-Based Analysis (by Day/Time of Day):**
   - Analyze performance during peak hours (7–9 AM, 5–7 PM) vs. off-peak.
   - Detect if delays are **time-dependent** (e.g., traffic jams in the afternoon).
   - Correlate with traffic data (if available) to validate congestion patterns.

4. **Driver- and Vehicle-Level Analysis:**
   - Compare average performance per driver (e.g., average on-time rate, dwell time).
   - Identify drivers with high failure rates or frequent unscheduled stops.
   - Correlate with vehicle type (e.g., smaller vans have more difficulty navigating tight urban zones).

5. **Spatial Analysis (Hotspot Detection):**
   - Cluster locations where "Low Speed Detected" or "Failed Delivery" occurs.
   - Use **geospatial clustering** (e.g., DBSCAN) to identify traffic or customer access hotspots.

>  *Quantifying Impact:*  
> For example, if the average dwell time at "Arrive Customer" is 35 minutes (vs. 10 minutes planned), and this occurs in 40% of stops, it increases total delivery time by 140 minutes/day per vehicle — directly impacting on-time delivery and fuel costs.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

Beyond identifying *where* inefficiencies occur, we must determine their *root causes* — the underlying reasons driving delays and cost increases.

### **Root Cause Candidates and Process Mining Validation**

| Root Cause | Process Mining Evidence |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Suboptimal Route Planning** | - High deviation from planned route (conformance check).<br> - Frequent unplanned stops in high-traffic zones.<br> - Route variants with high travel time and low on-time rates. |
| **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations** | - High frequency of "Low Speed Detected" at peak times.<br> - Travel time exceeds planned time by >20% in 30% of cases. |
| **Traffic Congestion Patterns** | - Correlation between GPS speed drops and time of day (e.g., 8:00–9:00 AM).<br> - High clustering of low-speed events in central districts. |
| **High Variability in Service Time** | - High variance in "Dwell Time" at customer stops.<br> - Failed deliveries often occur at locations with poor access (e.g., narrow streets, no parking). |
| **Frequent Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance** | - "Unscheduled Stop" events with engine warning lights.<br> - Correlation between maintenance logs and vehicle idle time. |
| **Driver Behavior or Skill Differences** | - High dwell times or failed deliveries linked to specific drivers.<br> - Driver-specific patterns in "Depart Customer" delays. |
| **High Failed Delivery Rate** | - "Delivery Failed" events clustered at specific times (e.g., weekends) or locations (e.g., apartment buildings).<br> - Re-delivery attempts lead to second stops — increasing travel time and cost. |

### **How Process Mining Validates These Causes:**

- **Correlation Analysis:** Use statistical correlation (e.g., Pearson) between "Failed Delivery" and "Time of Day" or "Customer Location Type".
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare performance of high-performing vs. low-performing drivers or routes to isolate behavioral or route-level differences.
- **Event Correlation:** Identify if "Low Speed Detected" precedes "Delivery Failed" — suggesting traffic congestion leads to failed attempts.
- **Temporal Patterns:** Detect if "Unscheduled Stop" events precede "End Shift" — indicating breakdowns leading to early termination.

>  *Example Insight:*  
> A process mining analysis reveals that **40% of failed deliveries occur at 8:00–9:00 AM** due to customers not being home. This is not due to driver error but to **inaccurate time window estimates** — a root cause that can be addressed via better customer communication.

## **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

Based on the process mining insights, we propose **three concrete, actionable, and scalable strategies** to improve punctuality and reduce costs.

---

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Route Adjustment with Real-Time Traffic Integration**

**Targets:**  
- Traffic-induced delays  
- Inaccurate travel time estimates  
- Delivery punctuality  

**Root Cause Addressed:**  
Suboptimal route planning due to static dispatch plans and poor traffic modeling.

**How Process Mining Supports This:**
- Identified high-frequency "Low Speed Detected" events in specific corridors (e.g., Main Street between 8:00–9:00 AM).
- Found that 60% of deviations from planned routes occur due to traffic congestion.
- Discovered that drivers often follow the same route despite traffic — indicating lack of dynamic adaptation.

**Implementation:**
- Integrate real-time traffic data (e.g., Google Maps API, HERE) into the dispatch system.
- Use **dynamic routing algorithms** that reroute vehicles during shifts if traffic exceeds 20% of average speed.
- Trigger alerts when a driver is >10 minutes behind schedule.

**Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
-  **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Increases by 15–20% (by avoiding traffic congestion).
-  **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Improves by 10–15% (less time wasted in traffic).
-  **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Reduces by 5–8% (less idling and faster routes).

---

### **Strategy 2: Optimized Territory and Route Sequencing Based on Performance Data**

**Targets:**  
- High failure rates  
- Inefficient delivery sequences  
- Underutilized vehicle capacity  

**Root Cause Addressed:**  
Static route planning without performance feedback — leading to poor customer access and high re-delivery costs.

**How Process Mining Supports This:**
- Identified that routes with high dwell time or failed deliveries (e.g., Route R-4) have 30% more failed attempts.
- Found that delivery sequences where customers are clustered in high-density areas (e.g., residential zones) perform better.
- Detected that "Arrive Customer" dwell times are 3x longer in locations with poor access (e.g., narrow streets).

**Implementation:**
- Use **process mining to cluster delivery locations** by performance (on-time rate, dwell time, failure rate).
- Reorganize routes to group **high-access, low-dwell-time customers** together.
- Implement **sequence optimization** (e.g., visit nearest customers first) to reduce travel distance and time.
- Assign new territories to drivers based on historical performance.

**Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
-  **Failed Delivery Rate:** Decreases by 25% (fewer failed attempts due to better access planning).
-  **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Increases by 10–15% (more deliveries per vehicle per day).
-  **Average Time per Stop:** Reduces by 15–20% (due to better sequencing).

---

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Schedules Based on Usage Patterns**

**Targets:**  
- Unscheduled vehicle breakdowns  
- High maintenance costs  
- Driver idle time due to breakdowns  

**Root Cause Addressed:**  
Lack of predictive maintenance — reactive repairs lead to unplanned stops and downtime.

**How Process Mining Supports This:**
- Discovered that "Unscheduled Stop" events with engine warnings occur frequently during peak hours (e.g., 8:00–10:00 AM).
- Found that vehicles with high "idle time" and frequent "Low Speed Detected" events are more prone to breakdowns.
- Identified that maintenance is scheduled only after a failure, not proactively.

**Implementation:**
- Build a **vehicle usage profile** using process mining:
  - Track speed, idle time, stop frequency, engine warnings.
  - Calculate a **"Vehicle Health Score"** per day (e.g., based on idling >10 min, speed <5 km/h, warning lights).
- Implement a **predictive maintenance model**:
  - Schedule preventive maintenance when health score exceeds threshold (e.g., >0.7).
  - Alert drivers and dispatchers 48 hours in advance.
- Use GPS and scanner data to monitor real-time health.

**Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
-  **Unscheduled Stop Frequency:** Reduces by 40%.
-  **Maintenance Costs:** Decreases by 15–20% (fewer emergency repairs).
-  **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Increases (less downtime during shifts).

## **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring**

### **Accounting for Operational Constraints**

Each strategy must respect real-world operational boundaries:

| Constraint | How It’s Addressed |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Driver Working Hours** | - Dynamic routing avoids late-night shifts.<br> - Route sequencing avoids long shifts (>8 hours). |
| **Vehicle Capacities** | - Route optimization ensures no vehicle exceeds 15 packages (based on dispatch capacity).<br> - Process mining flags overcapacity events. |
| **Customer Time Windows** | - Failed delivery rate is reduced via better time estimation.<br> - Real-time alerts to drivers if a delivery is at risk of missing a window. |

>  *All strategies are designed with dispatch rules and labor constraints in mind, ensuring compliance with safety and labor laws.*

### **Continuous Monitoring Plan Using Process Mining Dashboards**

To ensure sustainability and rapid response to new issues, Speedy Parcels should deploy a **real-time process mining dashboard** with the following components:

#### **Key Metrics Tracked:**
- On-Time Delivery Rate (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Failed Delivery Rate (by location, time, driver)
- Average Dwell Time per Stop
- Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio
- Unscheduled Stop Frequency
- Fuel Consumption per Package (trend over time)
- Vehicle Health Score (per vehicle)

#### **Process Views to Monitor:**
1. **Conformance Heatmap:** Shows deviation rates by route, driver, and time of day.
2. **Activity Duration Distribution:** Tracks outliers in dwell time or travel time.
3. **Variant Trends:** Monitors changes in delivery sequences over time.
4. **Failure Pattern Map:** Shows geographic clustering of failed deliveries.
5. **Maintenance Alerts:** Flags vehicles near maintenance threshold.

#### **Monitoring Frequency:**
- **Daily:** Summary reports for leadership.
- **Weekly:** Deep dive into top-performing and underperforming routes/drivers.
- **Monthly:** Review of KPI trends and strategy effectiveness.

#### **Alert System:**
- Automated alerts when:
  - A driver exceeds 20% deviation from planned route.
  - A vehicle health score drops below 0.5.
  - Failed delivery rate spikes in a region.

>  *This continuous loop of "monitor  analyze  act  refine" ensures that process mining is not a one-time analysis, but a living, adaptive system for continuous improvement.*
