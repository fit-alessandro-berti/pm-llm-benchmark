<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user provided a temporal profile model for an insurance claim process and wants me to identify anomalies, hypothesize why they exist, and propose SQL queries to verify them.

First, I need to look at the temporal_profile dictionary. Let's go through each pair.

Starting with ('R', 'A'): 3600 seconds (1 hour) average, STDEV 600 (10 mins). That seems reasonable. Receive to Assign taking about an hour, which makes sense for processing time. Maybe not an anomaly here.

Next, ('R', 'E'): 86400 (1 day) average, STDEV 28800 (8 hours). So 1 day ±8 hours. That's a bit variable but maybe okay. Like, sometimes it takes longer, sometimes shorter. Not sure yet.

Then ('R', 'P'): 90000 seconds (~25 hours), STDEV 3600 (1 hour). Wait, the STDEV is very low. Only 1 hour. That's suspicious because usually, approval times might vary more. If the standard deviation is so small, maybe the process is automated or there's a rigid schedule. But in reality, approvals might depend on various factors, so a low STDEV could indicate something's off. Like maybe all claims are approved exactly 25 hours after receive, which might not be realistic. Or perhaps the data is being manipulated.

Another one: ('A', 'C'): 7200 seconds (2 hours) average, STDEV 3600 (1 hour). So Assign to Close in 2 hours on average. But the process steps should be R->A->E->P->N->C. So if Assign to Close is only 2 hours, but Evaluate and Approve steps are missing, that's a problem. Like maybe claims are closed right after assignment without evaluation. That's a big red flag. So the anomaly here is that Assign to Close is too quick, skipping steps.

Then ('E', 'N'): 300 seconds (5 mins), STDEV 60 (1 min). That's very fast. Evaluate to Notify in 5 minutes. But usually, after evaluation, you might need to get approval first. Wait, the process steps are R, A, E, P, N, C. So after Evaluate (E), next should be Approve (P), then Notify (N). But here, the model has E to N as 5 minutes. But that skips P. So maybe the model is incorrect, or perhaps some claims are going directly from E to N without approval. But that's not supposed to happen. So this is an anomaly. The average time between E and N is 5 minutes, but according to the process, they should have P in between. So maybe the Notify step is happening right after Evaluate, which would mean Approve step is missing. Or maybe the model is mislabeled.

Wait, the model's ('E', 'N') pair. If the process is supposed to have E -> P -> N, then the time from E to N should include P. But if the average is 5 minutes, that's way too fast. Maybe they're skipping the approval step. So that's a problem.

Next, ('E', 'C'): 3600 seconds (1 hour), STDEV 3000 (50 mins). So Evaluate to Close in 1 hour on average. But according to process steps, after E comes P, then N, then C. So E to C should include P and N steps. If it's 1 hour, but the steps in between might take time. However, maybe the STDEV is high (50 mins), which could be normal. Not sure yet.

Then ('P', 'N'): 604800 seconds (7 days), STDEV 172800 (2 days). So 7 days between Approve and Notify. That's a very long time. Usually, after approving, you'd notify the customer quickly. 7 days is way too long. Maybe there's a backlog in the notification step. But why would there be such a long delay? Maybe the system is not sending notifications automatically, or there's a manual step that's delayed. But the STDEV is high (2 days), meaning sometimes it's 5 days, sometimes 9 days, which is inconsistent. So that's an anomaly.

Then ('N', 'C'): 1800 seconds (30 mins), STDEV 300 (5 mins). Notify to Close in 30 minutes. That seems reasonable. Maybe after notifying, closing is quick. Not sure if that's an issue.

So the main anomalies are:

- R to P: very low STDEV (only 1 hour). Normally, approval time should have more variation.

- A to C: 2 hours average. But according to process steps, after Assign (A), you need Evaluate (E), Approve (P), Notify (N), then Close (C). So Assign to Close in 2 hours would mean all those steps happen in 2 hours, but maybe they're skipping steps. Like maybe some claims are closed right after assignment without evaluation, which is not supposed to happen.

- E to N: 5 minutes average. But according to the process, after Evaluate (E), it should go to Approve (P), then Notify (N). So E to N should include P. But if E to N is 5 minutes, that suggests that Approve step is skipped, or the Notify step happens right after Evaluate without approval. Which would be a problem.

- P to N: 7 days average. That's way too long. Approval to notification should be quick. Maybe the notification is delayed because of manual processes, or maybe there's a system issue where notifications aren't sent automatically.

Now, for hypotheses.

For R to P with low STDEV: Maybe the system is automated to approve exactly 25 hours after receipt, but in reality, approvals should vary based on claim complexity. Alternatively, the data might be fake or generated by a script that always takes exactly 25 hours. Or perhaps the 'P' activity is being recorded incorrectly, like maybe some other activity is labeled as P.

A to C in 2 hours: Could be that some claims are closed immediately after assignment without evaluation. Maybe the adjuster is closing claims without proper review, or the system is auto-closing claims. Or perhaps the 'C' event is being triggered prematurely. For example, maybe some claims are closed right after assignment because they were rejected immediately, but the process steps might not have an 'R' or 'A' step. Wait, but the process steps are R, A, E, P, N, C. So if a claim is closed right after assignment, that would skip E, P, N. So maybe the claim was rejected immediately, but usually, there should be an evaluation step. Or perhaps the 'C' event is being recorded for claims that were never properly processed.

E to N in 5 minutes: If the process requires E -> P -> N, then E to N should take longer. If it's 5 minutes, maybe the 'P' step is missing. Like maybe the approval step isn't being recorded, or the Notify step is happening before approval. Which would be a problem. For example, maybe the system is sending notifications before the claim is approved, which is incorrect.

P to N: 7 days. Maybe after approval, the notification is delayed because of manual intervention. Like someone has to manually send the notification, and there's a backlog. Or maybe the system has a bug where notifications aren't sent automatically, so they're done manually with delays. Or perhaps the 'N' activity is being recorded later than it should, but the actual notification happened quickly. But the data shows the timestamp for 'N' is 7 days after 'P'.

Now for SQL queries.

First, for R to P anomaly. The model says R to P average 90000s (25h), STDEV 3600 (1h). So any claim where the time between R and P is outside 25h ± 3*STDEV (which would be 25h ±3h, so 22-28h). But since STDEV is very low, maybe even 25h ± 2h. But to check for outliers, we can look for claims where the time between R and P is outside, say, 22-28 hours.

But how to calculate the time between R and P for each claim.

In claim_events table, for each claim_id, find the timestamp of activity 'R' and 'P', then compute the difference. Then see if it's outside expected range.

So for R to P anomaly:

SELECT claim_id, 
       (P_timestamp - R_timestamp) AS time_diff
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS R_timestamp,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS P_timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) AS temp
WHERE (P_timestamp - R_timestamp) > INTERVAL '28 hours' OR (P_timestamp - R_timestamp) < INTERVAL '22 hours';

Wait, but the STDEV is 1 hour, so 3 standard deviations would be 3 hours. So 25h ±3h. So 22-28h. So any outside that range is an outlier.

But the problem says the STDEV is 3600 seconds (1h), so yes.

Similarly, for A to C. The model says average 2h, STDEV 1h. So 2h ± 3h? Wait, 3 standard deviations would be 3h. So 2-3= -1h? No. Wait, standard deviation is 3600 seconds (1h). So 2h average, STDEV 1h. So 3*STDEV is 3h. So the expected range is 2h ±3h, so from -1h to 5h. But negative time doesn't make sense. So probably the range is 0 to 5h. But maybe the actual process shouldn't have A to C directly. So perhaps for claims where A to C happens without E or P steps.

But how to check. For A to C, if the time between A and C is very short, but there are no E or P steps in between.

So for each claim, check if there's an 'A' event and a 'C' event, and the time between them is less than, say, 1 hour. Also, check if there are no E or P events between A and C.

Wait, but maybe the process steps should have A -> E -> P -> N -> C. So if A to C is done without E and P, that's a problem.

So to find claims where A and C happen, and there are no E or P activities in between.

So for each claim, get A timestamp and C timestamp, and check if there are no E or P between them.

But maybe the query would be:

SELECT claim_id, 
       A_timestamp, 
       C_timestamp,
       (C_timestamp - A_timestamp) AS time_diff
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS A_timestamp,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS C_timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) AS temp
WHERE (C_timestamp - A_timestamp) < INTERVAL '1 hour' 
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM claim_events ce 
    WHERE ce.claim_id = temp.claim_id 
      AND ce.activity IN ('E', 'P') 
      AND ce.timestamp > A_timestamp 
      AND ce.timestamp < C_timestamp
  );

This would find claims where after Assign (A), Close (C) happens within 1 hour, and there are no Evaluate or Approve steps in between. That's a possible anomaly.

For E to N: model says average 5 mins, STDEV 1 min. So expected range 4-6 mins. But according to the process, E should be followed by P, then N. So if E to N is too quick, maybe P is missing. So check for claims where E to N time is less than, say, 10 minutes, and there's no P activity between E and N.

Wait, but the model's E to N is supposed to be 5 mins. But in reality, there should be a P step. So perhaps the time between E and N should be longer. So the anomaly here is that E to N is happening without P. So the query would check for claims where E and N exist, but P does not exist between them.

So:

SELECT claim_id, 
       E_timestamp, 
       N_timestamp,
       (N_timestamp - E_timestamp) AS time_diff
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS E_timestamp,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS N_timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) AS temp
WHERE (N_timestamp - E_timestamp) < INTERVAL '10 minutes' 
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM claim_events ce 
    WHERE ce.claim_id = temp.claim_id 
      AND ce.activity = 'P' 
      AND ce.timestamp > E_timestamp 
      AND ce.timestamp < N_timestamp
  );

But the model's E to N average is 5 mins, which is very fast. So if the actual process should have P in between, then this query would find claims where E to N is too fast and P is missing.

For P to N: model says 7 days average, STDEV 2 days. So outliers could be where time between P and N is less than 5 days or more than 9 days. But the issue is that 7 days is too long. So maybe checking for claims where P to N time is longer than, say, 3 days. Or perhaps the STDEV is high, so some are very long and some are short. So maybe the variance is high. But the hypothesis is that there's inconsistency.

So query for P to N time longer than, say, 5 days. Or check the distribution.

But the model says average 7 days, which is already long. So perhaps the anomaly is that it's taking too long. So the query could find claims where P to N is more than 2 days, but maybe the average is 7 days, which is already bad. So maybe check for claims where P to N time is over 3 days. Or perhaps the standard deviation is high, but the main issue is the long average. So to verify, check the actual times.

But the SQL query could be:

SELECT claim_id, 
       (N_timestamp - P_timestamp) AS time_diff
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS P_timestamp,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS N_timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) AS temp
WHERE (N_timestamp - P_timestamp) > INTERVAL '3 days';

But maybe also check for cases where it's very short, like less than 1 day, to see if there's inconsistency. But the main anomaly is the long average.

Another point: for the E to N being 5 minutes, maybe the process step 'P' is not being recorded. So perhaps the 'P' activity is not happening, but the 'N' is. So the query would check for claims where E exists and N exists, but P does not exist at all. Or between E and N.

Similarly, for R to P: maybe the 'P' activity is not being recorded correctly. Like maybe some claims have R but no P, but the model assumes there is a P. But the model's R to P is present, so perhaps all claims have both R and P. But the low STDEV could be because the P is being recorded at exactly 25 hours after R for all claims. So maybe the system is auto-approving at a fixed time.

So the SQL query for R to P would check if all claims have R and P, and the time between them is within a narrow range.

Now, for the A to C anomaly, also check if the claim has E and P steps. If not, then maybe the claim was closed prematurely.

So possible hypotheses:

- R to P low STDEV: Possibly automated approval at fixed time, or data manipulation.

- A to C short time: Claims closed without evaluation or approval, maybe due to system error or manual bypass.

- E to N short time: Approval step (P) skipped, so Notify happens before approval.

- P to N long time: Bottleneck in notification process, maybe manual intervention required, or system issue delaying notifications.

For verification queries:

1. For R to P:

Check claims where time between R and P is outside 22-28 hours.

2. For A to C:

Find claims where Assign to Close is less than 1 hour and no E or P in between.

3. For E to N:

Find claims where Evaluate to Notify is less than 10 minutes and no Approve step in between.

4. For P to N:

Find claims where Approve to Notify is longer than 3 days.

Also, maybe correlate with adjusters or claim types.

For example, for P to N long delays, check if certain adjusters or regions have more delays.

So a query could group by adjuster_id or claim_type and check average time for P to N.

SELECT adjusters.name, 
       AVG(N_timestamp - P_timestamp) AS avg_delay
FROM (
    SELECT ce.claim_id, 
           ce.timestamp AS P_timestamp
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.activity = 'P'
) AS P_events
JOIN (
    SELECT ce.claim_id, 
           ce.timestamp AS N_timestamp
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.activity = 'N'
) AS N_events ON P_events.claim_id = N_events.claim_id
JOIN claims ON P_events.claim_id = claims.claim_id
JOIN adjusters ON claims.adjuster_id = adjusters.adjuster_id  -- Wait, but the claims table doesn't have adjuster_id. Wait, looking back at the schema.

Wait, the database context:

claims table has claim_id, customer_id, claim_amount, claim_type, submission_date.

adjusters table has adjuster_id, name, specialization, region.

claim_events has claim_id, activity, timestamp, resource, additional_info.

Wait, the claim_events table's 'resource' column is VARCHAR, which might be the adjuster's name or ID. Because the adjusters table has adjuster_id and name. So maybe the resource in claim_events for activity 'A' (Assign) is the adjuster's ID or name.

But the claims table doesn't have adjuster_id. So perhaps the resource in claim_events for Assign (A) activity is the adjuster's ID. So when the claim is assigned, the resource field would be the adjuster_id.

So to get adjuster info for a claim, we can look at the claim_events where activity = 'A', and resource is the adjuster_id.

So for example, to get the adjuster for a claim, we can join claim_events where activity = 'A' to adjusters table.

So for the P to N delay by adjuster:

SELECT a.name, 
       AVG(N_timestamp - P_timestamp) AS avg_delay
FROM (
    SELECT ce.claim_id, 
           ce.timestamp AS P_timestamp
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.activity = 'P'
) AS P_events
JOIN (
    SELECT ce.claim_id, 
           ce.timestamp AS N_timestamp
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.activity = 'N'
) AS N_events ON P_events.claim_id = N_events.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce_assign ON P_events.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce_assign.resource = a.adjuster_id  -- assuming resource is adjuster_id
GROUP BY a.name
HAVING AVG(N_timestamp - P_timestamp) > INTERVAL '3 days';

Similarly for other anomalies.

Another example: for R to P, check if certain claim types have more anomalies. Like auto_insurance vs home_insurance.

So in the R to P query, add claim_type.

SELECT c.claim_type, 
       AVG(time_diff) AS avg_time
FROM (
    SELECT c.claim_type,
           (P_timestamp - R_timestamp) AS time_diff
    FROM (
        SELECT claim_id,
               MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS R_timestamp,
               MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS P_timestamp
        FROM claim_events
        GROUP BY claim_id
    ) AS temp
    JOIN claims c ON temp.claim_id = c.claim_id
) AS sub
WHERE time_diff > INTERVAL '28 hours' OR time_diff < INTERVAL '22 hours'
GROUP BY c.claim_type;

But maybe more precise.

So the proposed SQL queries should check for outliers in specific pairs and correlate with other factors.

Now, compiling all this into the answer.

First, list the anomalies:

- Receive to Approve (RP) has a very low standard deviation (1 hour), suggesting uniform timing that may not reflect real-world variability.

- Assign to Close (AC) average time is 2 hours with high variability (STDEV 1 hour), but this skips expected intermediate steps like evaluation and approval.

- Evaluate to Notify (EN) average time of 5 minutes with minimal variation, which is unrealistic given the process requires approval before notification.

- Approve to Notify (PN) has a very long average delay (7 days) with high inconsistency (STDEV 2 days), indicating potential bottlenecks or inconsistent handling.

Hypotheses:

- RP low STDEV: System may auto-approve claims at fixed intervals, possibly bypassing manual review.

- AC short time: Claims closed prematurely without proper evaluation or approval, possibly due to system errors or manual overrides.

- EN short time: Approval step (P) is missing or skipped, leading to premature notification.

- PN long delay: Manual notification process causing delays, or system issues in sending notifications.

Verification SQL queries:

1. For RP anomalies:

Find claims where time between Receive and Approve deviates from expected 22-28 hours.

SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, 
       (P.timestamp - R.timestamp) AS time_diff
FROM claims c
JOIN (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'R') R ON c.claim_id = R.claim_id
JOIN (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P') P ON c.claim_id = P.claim_id
WHERE (P.timestamp - R.timestamp) NOT BETWEEN INTERVAL '22 hours' AND INTERVAL '28 hours';

2. For AC anomalies (no E/P between A and C):

SELECT c.claim_id, a.name AS adjuster, c.claim_type
FROM claims c
JOIN (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'A') A ON c.claim_id = A.claim_id
JOIN (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C') C ON c.claim_id = C.claim_id
LEFT JOIN claim_events E ON c.claim_id = E.claim_id AND E.activity = 'E' AND E.timestamp > A.timestamp AND E.timestamp < C.timestamp
LEFT JOIN claim_events P ON c.claim_id = P.claim_id AND P.activity = 'P' AND P.timestamp > A.timestamp AND P.timestamp < C.timestamp
WHERE (C.timestamp - A.timestamp) < INTERVAL '1 hour'
  AND E.claim_id IS NULL
  AND P.claim_id IS NULL;

3. For EN anomalies (missing P between E and N):

SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type
FROM claims c
JOIN (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'E') E ON c.claim_id = E.claim_id
JOIN (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'N') N ON c.claim_id = N.claim_id
LEFT JOIN claim_events P ON c.claim_id = P.claim_id AND P.activity = 'P' AND P.timestamp > E.timestamp AND P.timestamp < N.timestamp
WHERE (N.timestamp - E.timestamp) < INTERVAL '10 minutes'
  AND P.claim_id IS NULL;

4. For PN delays:

SELECT a.name AS adjuster, 
       AVG(N.timestamp - P.timestamp) AS avg_delay
FROM (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P') P
JOIN (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'N') N ON P.claim_id = N.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce_assign ON P.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce_assign.resource = a.adjuster_id
GROUP BY a.name
HAVING AVG(N.timestamp - P.timestamp) > INTERVAL '3 days';

Also, maybe check for PN delays by claim type.

Another query for PN delays by region:

SELECT a.region, 
       AVG(N.timestamp - P.timestamp) AS avg_delay
FROM (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P') P
JOIN (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'N') N ON P.claim_id = N.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce_assign ON P.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce_assign.resource = a.adjuster_id
GROUP BY a.region
HAVING AVG(N.timestamp - P.timestamp) > INTERVAL '3 days';

That's a good way to see if certain regions have more delays.

So putting it all together.
</think>
### Identified Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive to Approve (RP)**: Extremely low standard deviation (1 hour) despite a 25-hour average. This suggests rigid, possibly automated timing that lacks real-world variability for claim approvals.  
2. **Assign to Close (AC)**: Average closure time of 2 hours with high variability (STDEV 1 hour). This is suspicious as the process should require intermediate steps (Evaluate, Approve, Notify) before closing.  
3. **Evaluate to Notify (EN)**: Only 5 minutes average with minimal variation (STDEV 1 minute). This violates the expected workflow where approval (P) must precede notification (N).  
4. **Approve to Notify (PN)**: 7-day average delay with high inconsistency (STDEV 2 days). This indicates severe bottlenecks or inconsistent handling after approval.  

---

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

- **RP low STDEV**: System may auto-approve claims at fixed intervals without manual review, or data is artificially generated.  
- **AC short closure**: Claims might be closed prematurely due to system errors, manual overrides, or missing evaluation steps.  
- **EN missing approval**: The "Approve" step (P) is likely skipped entirely, causing notifications to occur before proper evaluation.  
- **PN long delays**: Manual notification processes (e.g., human intervention) create bottlenecks, or system failures delay automated notifications inconsistently.  

---

### Verification SQL Queries

#### 1. **Check RP Timing Deviations**
Identify claims where Receive-to-Approve time falls outside the expected 22–28 hour window:
```sql
SELECT 
  c.claim_id, 
  c.claim_type, 
  (P.timestamp - R.timestamp) AS time_diff
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events R ON c.claim_id = R.claim_id AND R.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events P ON c.claim_id = P.claim_id AND P.activity = 'P'
WHERE (P.timestamp - R.timestamp) NOT BETWEEN INTERVAL '22 hours' AND INTERVAL '28 hours';
```

#### 2. **Detect Premature AC Closures (Skipping E/P Steps)**
Find claims closed within 1 hour of assignment without Evaluate or Approve steps in between:
```sql
SELECT 
  c.claim_id, 
  a.name AS adjuster, 
  c.claim_type
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events A ON c.claim_id = A.claim_id AND A.activity = 'A'
JOIN claim_events C ON c.claim_id = C.claim_id AND C.activity = 'C'
LEFT JOIN claim_events E ON c.claim_id = E.claim_id 
  AND E.activity = 'E' 
  AND E.timestamp > A.timestamp 
  AND E.timestamp < C.timestamp
LEFT JOIN claim_events P ON c.claim_id = P.claim_id 
  AND P.activity = 'P' 
  AND P.timestamp > A.timestamp 
  AND P.timestamp < C.timestamp
WHERE (C.timestamp - A.timestamp) < INTERVAL '1 hour'
  AND E.claim_id IS NULL 
  AND P.claim_id IS NULL;
```

#### 3. **Identify EN Without Approval Step**
Detect Evaluate-to-Notify transitions shorter than 10 minutes where Approve (P) is missing:
```sql
SELECT 
  c.claim_id, 
  c.claim_type
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events E ON c.claim_id = E.claim_id AND E.activity = 'E'
JOIN claim_events N ON c.claim_id = N.claim_id AND N.activity = 'N'
LEFT JOIN claim_events P ON c.claim_id = P.claim_id 
  AND P.activity = 'P' 
  AND P.timestamp > E.timestamp 
  AND P.timestamp < N.timestamp
WHERE (N.timestamp - E.timestamp) < INTERVAL '10 minutes'
  AND P.claim_id IS NULL;
```

#### 4. **Analyze PN Delays by Adjuster/Region**
Check for excessive Approve-to-Notify delays (>3 days) and correlate with adjusters or regions:
```sql
SELECT 
  a.name AS adjuster, 
  a.region, 
  AVG(N.timestamp - P.timestamp) AS avg_delay
FROM claim_events P 
JOIN claim_events N ON P.claim_id = N.claim_id 
  AND P.activity = 'P' 
  AND N.activity = 'N'
JOIN claim_events A_assign ON P.claim_id = A_assign.claim_id 
  AND A_assign.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON A_assign.resource = a.adjuster_id
GROUP BY a.name, a.region
HAVING AVG(N.timestamp - P.timestamp) > INTERVAL '3 days';
```

#### 5. **Check Claim-Type-Specific PN Delays**
Identify if certain claim types (e.g., auto vs. home insurance) have disproportionately long delays:
```sql
SELECT 
  c.claim_type, 
  AVG(N.timestamp - P.timestamp) AS avg_delay
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events P ON c.claim_id = P.claim_id AND P.activity = 'P'
JOIN claim_events N ON c.claim_id = N.claim_id AND N.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY c.claim_type
HAVING AVG(N.timestamp - P.timestamp) > INTERVAL '3 days';
```
