# 1. Activity Descriptions
print("#### Activity Descriptions:\n")
print("Receive_Application (A): Initial intake of a loan application from a customer.")
print("Preliminary_Credit_Check (B): Conduct a first-level assessment of the applicant’s creditworthiness.")
print("Gather_Additional_Documents (C): Request and collect supplementary documents (e.g., income statements, tax returns).")
print("Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package (D): Prepare the set of terms, interest rates, and conditions for the loan offer.")
print("Quality_Assurance_Review (E): Conduct a quality and compliance review of all collected materials and prepared offers.")
print("Authorize_Contract_Terms (F): Officially approve or finalize the contract terms before issuing them to the customer.")
print("Transfer_Funds (G): Disburse the loaned amount to the customer’s account after all approvals.")
print("Notify_Customer (H): Inform the customer about the loan decision, approved terms, or next steps.")
print("Proceed_Without_Compliance (Z): An action that should never happen; breaking compliance rules is strictly prohibited.\n")

# 2. Constraint Explanation
print('''#### Constraint Explanation:\n\n''')

# Existence Constraints (activities which must occur):
print('Existence Constraints:')
print("- **Receive_Application**: Application must be received for the loan process to begin. Explicitly mandated, as it constitutes the foundational step.")
print("- **Gather_Additional_Documents**: Mandatory when additional information is required for risk assessment and compliance.\n")

# Absence Constraints (activities which must not occur):
print("Absence Constraints:")
print("- **Proceed_Without_Compliance**: Absolutely forbidden, signifying that the process shall not commence if compliance conditions are not met. Demonstrates the foundation of compliance integrity in the interpretive cycle.")
print("\n")

# Exactly One:
print("Exactly One:")
print("- **Preliminary_Credit_Check**: Smoother path to final loan evaluation and quality assurance.")
print("\n")

# Init, Response, Succession Constraints
print("Init, Response, Succession Constraints:")
print("- **Receive_Application -> Proceed_Without_Compliance && Receive_Application**: Indicates that an application must exist for other processes to proceed.")
print("- Response: Ensures every step receives legitimate reasons.")
print("- Succession: Defines activities succession in a guaranteed proper pattern for compliance.\n")

# Data Pattern Analysis
print("Data Pattern Analysis:")
print("- **Response**: Every loan intake is followed by preliminary checks, ensuring that loans never commence with uncertainty.")
print("- **Succession**: Defining scope of how documents gathering, offer assembly, and contract authorization are legally and logistically executed.\n")

# Business Goals and Regulatory Conformity
print("#### Business Goals and Regulatory Conformity:\n")
print("- **Compliance**: Automating procedures for risk management, regulatory oversight, and ethical operation\n")
print("- **Customer Trust**: Ensuring the process is transparent with customers, offering them insight into every phase of the loan handling.\n")
print("- **Financial Risk Mitigation**: Demonstrating the procedural framework's significance, regular governance, and mitigating potential financial losses triggered through unreliable or non-compliant loans.")
print("- **Data Protection and Privacy**: Scheduling required security steps in order to handle personally identifiable information (PII) per regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, FCRA).\n")

print('''Conclusion:
2. Analyze constraints and sequence: The constraints enable strict control over only acting appropriate and necessary steps, meaning approving critical assets like customer PII and bankable data are properly verified.
3. Regulatory Compliance Role: Guidelines necessitate every loan application to follow the same procedural gateway to minimizing potential financial risks, ensuring regulatory conformity, and securing customer trust.
4. Business Integrity: To maintain transparency in operations, all security controls and quality checks must be in place before loans can be disbursed, fostering trust in the organization’s commitment to another company and customer satisfaction.
5. Structure of Process: The procedural rules describe a formal mechanism for achieving excellence in performance, highlighting the importance of compliance and high-level logical verification throughout the loan application process.

This code provides a detailed textual analysis of the DECLARE model, explaining the activity descriptions, constraints, interplay of rules, business goals, and regulatory considerations in the real-life scenario of a loan application process. The output of this code print() calls the analysis to a console or text output interface, aiding in understanding the real-world application of such a model in loan processing.
