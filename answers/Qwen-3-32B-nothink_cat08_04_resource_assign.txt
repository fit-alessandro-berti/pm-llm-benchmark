# **Optimizing IT Service Desk Resource Assignment at TechSolve Solutions: A Process Mining-Driven Approach**

---

## **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

### **1.1 Agent and Tier Performance Metrics**
To analyze resource behavior, I would leverage the event log to calculate the following metrics:

#### **Agent-Level Metrics:**
- **First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate (L1):** % of tickets resolved at the first assignment without escalation.
- **Average Handling Time (AHT):** Time from assignment to resolution (or escalation).
- **Skill Utilization Rate:** % of tickets handled where agent’s skills match the required skills.
- **Ticket Throughput:** Number of tickets handled per unit time.
- **Workload Distribution:** Number of tickets assigned per agent per day/week.
- **Error Rate (if available):** % of tickets requiring reassignment or escalation due to incorrect handling.

#### **Tier-Level Metrics:**
- **Tier Escalation Rate:** % of tickets that escalate from one tier to the next.
- **Tier Utilization:** % of time agents are actively working vs. idle.
- **SLA Compliance by Tier:** % of tickets resolved within SLA by tier.
- **Reassignment Frequency by Tier:** How often tickets are reassigned within or between tiers.
- **Skill Coverage Index:** % of required skills in the tier that are available within the agent pool.

#### **Ticket-Level Metrics:**
- **Time to First Assignment (TFA):** Time between ticket creation and first assignment.
- **Time to Resolution (TTR):** Time between ticket creation and resolution.
- **Number of Reassignments per Ticket:** Indicates inefficiencies in assignment logic.
- **Skill Match Score:** Whether the assigned agent had the required skill set.
- **Escalation Reason Codes (if available):** Categorizes why tickets were escalated (e.g., skill mismatch, complexity).

### **1.2 Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Analysis**

#### **Resource Interaction Analysis:**
- **Handover Analysis:** Identify patterns of ticket handovers between agents and tiers.
- **Bottleneck Detection:** Identify agents or tiers with high queue times or long processing times.
- **Resource Bottlenecks:** Detect if certain skill sets or agents are overused or underused.

#### **Social Network Analysis (SNA):**
- Map **agent-to-agent handovers** to detect informal collaboration patterns or reassignment chains.
- Identify **key connectors** (e.g., agents who frequently receive reassignments or act as escalators).
- Reveal **clusters of agents** with similar skills or workloads.

#### **Role Discovery:**
- Discover if **actual roles** (e.g., L1, L2, L3) align with the **intended roles**.
- Identify if **agents are being used outside their intended role**, such as L3 agents handling basic L1 tickets due to L1 overload.

---

### **1.3 Skill Utilization Analysis**

#### **Skill Matching Analysis:**
- For each ticket, check whether the assigned agent had the **required skill** (e.g., App-CRM, DB-SQL).
- Calculate **skill mismatch rate** (e.g., % of tickets where assigned agent lacks required skill).
- Identify **underutilized skills** (e.g., agents with DB-SQL skills assigned only to basic troubleshooting tickets).
- Use **skill coverage analysis** to detect skill gaps in the agent pool.

#### **Skill Proficiency Modeling:**
- If the event log contains data on **resolution success/failure** by agent and skill, build a **proficiency matrix**.
- Use this to identify **high-performing agents** for specific skills and **low-performing ones**.

---

## **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

### **2.1 Bottleneck Identification**

Using the above metrics and process mining, I would identify the following bottlenecks:

#### **2.1.1 Skill Bottlenecks:**
- **High Skill Mismatch Rate:** If 30% of L2 tickets are assigned to agents without required skills.
- **Long Queue Times for Specialized Skills:** E.g., DB-SQL tickets have 45-minute average wait time in L2 queue.

#### **2.1.2 Escalation Bottlenecks:**
- **High Escalation Rates from L1:** E.g., 60% of L1 tickets are escalated.
- **Escalation Delays:** If L1 agents take 15 minutes on average to decide escalation, but could resolve 20% of those tickets with training.

#### **2.1.3 Reassignment Bottlenecks:**
- **High Reassignment Rate per Ticket:** E.g., 30% of tickets are reassigned 2+ times.
- **Average Delay per Reassignment:** E.g., 10–20 minutes of delay per reassignment.
- **Inefficient Reassignment Logic:** E.g., tickets are reassigned without skill checks, leading to repeated mismatches.

#### **2.1.4 SLA Breach Correlation:**
- **SLA Breach by Assignment Pattern:** E.g., 40% of SLA breaches occur in tickets that had 2+ reassignments.
- **SLA Breach by Skill Mismatch:** E.g., 35% of P2 breaches are due to incorrect skill assignments.

#### **2.1.5 Agent Underperformance or Overload:**
- **Overloaded Agents:** E.g., Agent A05 handles 10+ tickets/hour with 50% escalations.
- **Underutilized Agents:** E.g., Agent B15 has DB-SQL skills but is only assigned 5% of DB-related tickets.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

### **3.1 Potential Root Causes**

| Issue | Root Cause |
|-------|------------|
| High reassignment rate | Poor initial assignment logic (e.g., round-robin), lack of skill-based routing |
| Skill mismatch | Incomplete or outdated agent skill profiles |
| Escalation inefficiency | L1 agents lack training or empowerment for common issues |
| Uneven workload | No workload-aware assignment logic |
| SLA breaches | Delayed reassignments and inefficient escalations |

---

### **3.2 Variant and Decision Mining for Root Cause Identification**

#### **Variant Analysis:**
- Compare **smooth tickets** (e.g., 0 reassignments, resolved by L1) vs. **problematic tickets** (e.g., 3+ reassignments, SLA breach).
- Use **conformance checking** to identify where the actual process deviates from the ideal process.

#### **Decision Mining:**
- Analyze **escalation decisions** made by L1 agents to determine if they are based on correct criteria (e.g., skill, complexity).
- Use **decision trees** to identify the most influential factors in reassignment and escalation decisions.

#### **Skill Profiling Analysis:**
- If the log contains **resolution success** data, build a **skill-to-agent performance matrix** to identify underperforming agents and overqualified agents.
