I'm sorry, but I don't have any information about an "hypothesis" or "process" where there is a purchase and payment sequence involved. Typically, such models would describe real-world scenarios in business processes and systems.

However, if you provide more context about the hypothetical scenario you're referring to (e.g., the product being purchased, the customer making a purchase order, etc.), I can certainly help with generating DECLARE model for that situation.
