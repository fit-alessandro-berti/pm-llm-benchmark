Based on the declarative constraints provided, I will attempt to deduce the process underlying this data.

**Overview**

The process appears to be related to a workflow or approval process for some sort of financial or procurement request. The activities involved involve requesting approval, receiving approval, submitting documents, and handling payments.

**Sequence**

Here is the sequence of events that can be inferred from the constraints:

1. A request is made to APPROVE something (e.g., payment).
2. The request goes through a series of approvals:
 * The request is approved by ADMINISTRATION (0 or 1 occurrence).
3. If approved, the request then goes through another level of approval:
 * The request is approved by PRE_APPROVER (0 or 1 occurrence), and if this is not already done.
4. If both approvals are granted, the request proceeds to submission:
 * The request is submitted by EMPLOYEE (0-7 occurrences).
5. Upon submission, the request may be rejected by MISSING, leading to further review and potential rejection by ADMINISTRATION or SUPERVISOR.
6. After approval by PRE_APPROVER and EMPLOYEE, a payment can be handled:
 * Payment is handled after receipt of final approval from BUDGET OWNER (0 or 1 occurrence).
7. There are also parallel paths that involve different approvers:
 * A request may be rejected by ADMINISTRATION or SUPERVISOR directly.
 * Alternatively, a request may go through a series of approvals involving PRE_APPROVER and SUPERVISOR.

**Key Activities**

The key activities in this process are:

* Requesting approval
* Approving the request (by ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, and BUDGET OWNER)
* Submitting documents
* Handling payments

**Special Cases**

There are special cases to consider:

* If a request is rejected by MISSING or SUPERVISOR after submission, it may be re-submitted.
* If a request is rejected by ADMINISTRATION or SUPERVISOR, it may go through further review and potentially be approved again.

Please note that this interpretation is based on the declarative constraints provided and may not reflect the actual process underlying the data.
