Here's the analysis of the provided event log, identifying violations against the normative process description:

**Case 1: No Violations**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:** This case follows the expected process flow for sufficient inventory: Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. No violations are present.

**Case 2: Violation**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:** This case violates the rule that "Authorize payment" should only occur *after* "Check inventory" and *before* packaging. The activity sequence is: Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Specifically, payment is authorized *after* packaging, which contradicts the normative flow.

**Case 3: Violation**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:** This case violates two rules:
    1.  It violates the rule that "Ship order" should *never* occur after a "Cancel order".  The normative description explicitly states the process diverges into Cancel -> Close, but this case attempts to ship *after* cancelling.
    2.  It also likely violates the payment authorization. After a cancellation, it is illogical to proceed with payment authorization.

**Case 4: No Violations**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:** This case correctly follows the "Cancel order" flow.  It has the activities: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. This satisfies the requirements when inventory check leads to cancellation.

**Case 5: Violation**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:** This case is similar to Case 1 but with the activity 'Package items' missing. The rule that "Ship order" should only occur after packaging is not met. Therefore, this case is considered to violate the rules.

**Summary of Violations:**

*   **Case 2:** Authorize payment occurred *after* packaging.
*   **Case 3:** "Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order", and payment authorization seems inappropriate.
*   **Case 5:** The step of "Package items" is missing.
