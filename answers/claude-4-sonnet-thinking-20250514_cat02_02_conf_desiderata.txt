Based on my analysis of the event log against the normative rules and desiderata, here are my findings:

## 1. Normative Rule Violations (Serious Issues)

**Case 2 has TWO critical normative violations:**

1. **Incorrect Activity Ordering**: Risk Assessment was performed at 08:20 before Credit Check at 09:00. This violates the strict ordering rule that "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."

2. **Invalid Documentation After Rejection**: Finalize Documentation was performed at 10:00 after the loan was rejected at 09:30. The normative rules explicitly state that "if loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."

**Cases 1 and 3**: No normative violations - both follow the required sequence and decision logic correctly.

## 2. Desiderata Violations (Suboptimal but Not Critical)

**Case 1**: 
- Missing Follow-up Call (encouraged but not required)
- All timing requirements met

**Case 2**: 
- Missing Follow-up Call
- Timing requirements technically met despite the normative violations

**Case 3**: 
- **Late Credit Check**: Performed 49 hours after application (exceeds 24-hour recommendation)
- **Late Applicant Notification**: Informed applicant 75 hours after loan decision (exceeds 48-hour recommendation)  
- Missing Follow-up Call

## 3. Interpretations and Justifications

**Case 1**: Represents ideal process execution with perfect adherence to all normative rules and good timing practices.

**Case 2**: Suggests possible system/procedural failures or training issues. The wrong activity order could indicate:
- Process automation errors
- Staff unfamiliarity with proper sequence
- Emergency/rush processing that bypassed normal controls

**Case 3**: Indicates potential resource constraints or workload issues. The delays might be justified by:
- High application volume during busy periods
- Staff shortages or competing priorities
- More complex applications requiring additional review time
- While not ideal, the delays don't compromise the integrity of the decision-making process

**Recommendation**: Case 2 requires immediate attention due to normative violations, while Case 3 represents an opportunity for process optimization to better meet timing objectives.
