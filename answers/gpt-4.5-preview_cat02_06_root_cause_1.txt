### Step 1: Identify Cases with Significant Delays

First, let's calculate the total resolution time for each case—from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket":

- **Case 101:** Received (Mar 1, 8:00)  Closed (Mar 1, 10:15)  
  **Total time:** 2 hours 15 minutes *(short)*

- **Case 102:** Received (Mar 1, 8:05)  Closed (Mar 2, 9:15)  
  **Total time:** 25 hours 10 minutes *(very long)*

- **Case 103:** Received (Mar 1, 8:10)  Closed (Mar 1, 9:30)  
  **Total time:** 1 hour 20 minutes *(shortest)*

- **Case 104:** Received (Mar 1, 8:20)  Closed (Mar 2, 8:30)  
  **Total time:** 24 hours 10 minutes *(significantly longer)*

- **Case 105:** Received (Mar 1, 8:25)  Closed (Mar 3, 9:30)  
  **Total time:** 49 hours 5 minutes *(longest delay)*

### Observation:
- Short Resolution Cases: 101, 103 (~1-2 hours)
- Long Resolution Cases: 102, 104, 105 (~24-49 hours)

Clearly, **Cases 102, 104, 105** show significantly longer overall cycle times.

### Step 2: Identify Potential Root Causes for Performance Issues

Let's closely analyze the delayed cases (102, 104, and 105):

#### Case 102:
- Delay between **"Assign to Level-1 Agent"** (9:00) and **"Escalate to Level-2 Agent"** (11:30)  **2.5 hours**
- Major delay between **"Escalate"** (Mar 1, 11:30) and **"Investigate Issue"** at Level-2 (Mar 1, 14:00)  **2.5 hours waiting period**
- Significant overnight delay between investigate completion and resolve:
  - **"Investigate Issue"** (Mar 1, 14:00) to **"Resolve Ticket"** (Mar 2, 9:00): **19 hours**
- Actual investigative activities are few and short compared to idle/transition times.

#### Case 104:
- Long waiting duration between **"Assign to Level-1"** (Mar 1, 9:30) and **"Investigate Issue"** start (Mar 1, 13:00)  **3.5 hours**
- Largest delay overnight from **"Investigate Issue"** (Mar 1, 13:00) to Resolution (Mar 2, 8:00)  **19 hours**
- No escalation occurred—issues are rooted in the delayed start of Level-1 investigation and overnight delay.

#### Case 105:
- Massive delay between **"Escalate to Level-2 Agent"** (Mar 1, 10:00) and the Level-2 **"Investigate Issue"** (Mar 2, 14:00)  **28 hours of idle wait**
- Another overnight delay from **Investigation** (Mar 2, 14:00) to **Resolution** (Mar 3, 9:00)  **19 hours**
- Clearly, escalation caused this worst delay scenario.

### Step 3: Summarizing Insights & Explaining Factors Leading to Increased Cycle Times

#### Primary Identified Factors:
1. **Ticket Escalation to Level-2 Agents:**
   - The two escalated tickets (102, 105) have substantial idle periods before investigation by Level-2 agents begins (up to 28 hours in case 105), likely caused by limited specialist availability or unclear handoff procedures.

2. **Delayed Initiation of Investigation after Assignment:**
   - Even when tickets are not escalated (as in case 104), delays in starting investigations at Level-1 significantly impact resolution times.

3. **Overnight Delays:**
   - Investigative activities completed late in the day lead to overnight idle periods. This could indicate a lack of overnight team availability or operational restrictions (e.g., standard office hours) affecting ticket resolution performance.

### Step 4: Recommended Actions to Address Performance Bottlenecks:

Based on these findings, the following recommendations could help reduce resolution delays:

1. **Reducing Escalation Delay through Clearer Procedures:**
   - Improve handoff procedures and response SLAs for Level-2 specialists.  
   - Assess whether additional Level-2 capacity during peak hours could reduce long waiting periods.

2. **Early Start of Investigation after Assignment:**
   - Ensuring Level-1 agents promptly act after assignment, potentially automating reminders, clearer SLAs, or workload monitoring can reduce idle wait periods.

3. **Mitigating Overnight Delays:**
   - If operationally feasible, reviewing scheduling practices might be necessary; hesitant ticket initiating investigations at the end of working hours results in avoidable overnight delays. Options could include a staggered schedule, rotating shifts, or at least clearer expectations on investigating types of tasks and time required.

---

### Final Summary:

- **Delayed Cases Include:** 102, 104, 105.
- **Main Delay Causes:**
  - Escalation idle time (case 102, 105)
  - Delayed investigation start (all 3 delayed cases)
  - Overnight wait ("dead time" during non-working hours)

By addressing these explicit factors through clearer escalation guidelines, improved operational support, and potential scheduling adjustments, significant reductions in ticket handling cycle times could be achieved.
