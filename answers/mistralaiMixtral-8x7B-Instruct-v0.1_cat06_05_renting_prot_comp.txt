 Based on the provided process variants and their corresponding frequencies and execution times, I assume that the context is related to a tenant selection process in a rental property scenario. I am making the following assumptions about the "protected" and "unprotected" groups:

* Protected group: People who fall under a protected category based on anti-discrimination laws (e.g., race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability).
* Unprotected group: People who do not fall under the protected categories mentioned above.

The main differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group in this tenant selection process are:

1. Screening: The protected group undergoes more thorough screening processes compared to the unprotected group. The protected group has a higher number of process variants that include "Extensive Screening," which implies harsher evaluation criteria.

2. Frequency of tenant cancellation: The protected group has a higher frequency of "Tenant Cancels Apartment" compared to the unprotected group across all process variants. This suggests that the protected group is more likely to be subject to cancellations, possibly due to the stricter evaluation criteria or some sort of bias.

3. Execution time: Although difficult to draw decisive conclusions, on some occasions, the execution time for specific process variants is longer for the protected group. Longer processing times might result from additional checks, resulting in potential delays or inefficiencies in the tenant selection process for the protected group.

4. Rejection rate: The protected group has a higher overall rejection rate compared to the unprotected group (more variants of the protected group include rejection).

In summary, the protected group faces stricter evaluation criteria, a higher likelihood of cancellation, potentially longer processing times, and a higher rejection rate compared to the unprotected group. These differences point to the possibility of unfair treatment of the protected group during the tenant selection process. It is essential to investigate further and address any underlying biases or discriminatory practices.
