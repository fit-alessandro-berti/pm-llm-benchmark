Here is a concise, activity-labeled view of the single manufacturing run in your log, with the rationale for each phase.

Discovered sequence (by event ranges):
- Idle/Standby: Events 1–3
- Cutting Metal: Events 4–6
- Assembling/Clamping: Events 7–8
- Welding: Event 9
- Cool-down/Release: Event 10
- Quality Inspection: Events 11–12
- Idle/End: Events 13–15

Why each label fits the data:

1) Idle/Standby (Events 1–3 and 13–15)
- Signature: Temperature 20–21°C, pressure 1 bar, vibration 0, flow 0, tool position 0 mm (start) or back to 0 mm (end), low energy 0.40–0.50 kWh.
- Interpretation: Machine powered but not engaging the workpiece; baseline conditions before and after the run.

2) Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)
- Signature: Strong increases in vibration (3038 Hz), temperature (5058°C), and energy (2.03.0 kWh); sustained material flow at 5 units/s; tool position advances (510 mm); pressure modest (11.5 bar).
- Interpretation: High vibration and rising temperature while the tool advances into material and feed is active are characteristic of cutting/machining.

3) Assembling/Clamping (Events 7–8)
- Signature: Pressure increases to 2 bar, vibration drops to 10 Hz, flow reduced to 2 units/s, tool position holds at 15 mm, energy steady around 2.0 kWh, temperature drops to 40°C.
- Interpretation: Higher pneumatic pressure with lower vibration and a fixed position is consistent with clamping/press-fit or aligning parts prior to joining.

4) Welding (Event 9)
- Signature: Temperature spikes to 80°C; energy peaks at 5.0 kWh; tool position fixed (15 mm); flow = 0; pressure remains 2 bar; vibration rises to 50 Hz.
- Interpretation: A heat-intensive, stationary operation with high power draw and no feed flow strongly indicates welding.

5) Cool-down/Release (Event 10)
- Signature: Sharp drop in temperature (to 30°C), energy (to 1.0 kWh), and vibration (to 1 Hz); pressure returns to 1 bar; tool position unchanged at 15 mm.
- Interpretation: Post-weld cooling and release of clamping pressure; minimal activity before moving to the next step.

6) Quality Inspection (Events 11–12)
- Signature: Temperature near ambient (25°C), low vibration (5 Hz), low energy (1.5–1.6 kWh), small material flow (1 units/s), and a small reposition to tool position 20 mm.
- Interpretation: Gentle, low-power, low-vibration behavior with slight repositioning suggests measurement/inspection rather than fabrication.

Notes:
- The data does not show a distinct Packaging step. If present, it would typically feature low temperature, moderate-low energy, modest vibration, and higher material flow (conveyance) after inspection.
- The detected change points between activities are at Events 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 13, where multiple signals shift together (temperature, energy, vibration, flow, pressure, and/or tool position).
- Simple rule-of-thumb mapping used here:
  - Cutting: high vibration + advancing tool position + active flow + rising temperature/energy.
  - Assembly/Clamp: higher pressure + low vibration + fixed position.
  - Welding: very high temperature and energy + zero flow + fixed position.
  - Inspection: near-ambient temperature + low energy/vibration + small repositioning + minimal flow.
  - Idle: baseline signals with no flow or motion.

This yields a plausible end-to-end process model: Idle  Cutting  Assembling/Clamping  Welding  Cool-down/Release  Quality Inspection  Idle.
