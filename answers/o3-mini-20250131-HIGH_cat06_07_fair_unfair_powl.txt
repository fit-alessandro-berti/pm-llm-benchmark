Below are two POWL models that capture the GlobalTeq Solutions hiring process as described. In the **first model**, after the skill assessment the process splits using an XOR branch into either a standard cultural fit evaluation or a “CommunityAffiliationCheck” that subtly favors some candidates. In the **second model**, all applicants follow the same cultural fit evaluation (i.e., no community‐based branch is present).

For both models, we first define a loop to ensure the applicant’s resume data is complete (using a loop between “DataCompletenessCheck” and “RequestMoreInfo”), then follow a sequential order through “SkillAssessment” and onward. Finally, we add the ordering edges to ensure the proper sequence.

Below is one way to represent these models in Python‐like pseudocode using POWL’s classes:

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication         = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck      = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo            = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment            = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck           = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck  = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # This branch gives subtle advantage
ManagerialReview           = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision              = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define a loop for the resume data completeness check:
# First, check if data is complete; if not, ask for more information and repeat.
CompletenessLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define an XOR branch for cultural evaluation:
# Either go through the standard cultural check or (if community affiliation is detected) the adjusted check.
CulturalXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the overall process as a StrictPartialOrder
process_with_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    CompletenessLoop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalXOR,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define sequential ordering among activities:
process_with_bias.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, CompletenessLoop)
process_with_bias.order.add_edge(CompletenessLoop, SkillAssessment)
process_with_bias.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalXOR)
process_with_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalXOR, ManagerialReview)
process_with_bias.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation:**  
1. The process starts with **ReceiveApplication**.  
2. The **CompletenessLoop** ensures that every applicant’s resume has all required information (looping between **DataCompletenessCheck** and **RequestMoreInfo**).  
3. Next, the **SkillAssessment** is performed.  
4. The XOR branch (**CulturalXOR**) then directs the flow either to the standard **CulturalFitCheck** or to a **CommunityAffiliationCheck** (which may inadvertently favor certain candidates).  
5. Finally, the **ManagerialReview** leads to the **FinalDecision**.

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication    = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo       = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment       = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck      = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # All applicants follow this uniform check
ManagerialReview      = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision         = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define a loop for ensuring complete resume information:
CompletenessLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the overall process as a StrictPartialOrder without any XOR branch:
process_without_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    CompletenessLoop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define sequential ordering among activities:
process_without_bias.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, CompletenessLoop)
process_without_bias.order.add_edge(CompletenessLoop, SkillAssessment)
process_without_bias.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
process_without_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
process_without_bias.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation:**  
1. The process begins with **ReceiveApplication**.  
2. The **CompletenessLoop** (between **DataCompletenessCheck** and **RequestMoreInfo**) ensures that resume data is complete.  
3. The applicant then undergoes the **SkillAssessment**.  
4. All applicants then follow the same **CulturalFitCheck** (without any alternative path that could confer an unfair advantage).  
5. The process concludes with the **ManagerialReview** and the **FinalDecision**.

These two models clearly illustrate the difference in handling the cultural evaluation stage: the first introduces an XOR branch (and thus potential bias) by providing a special check for community-affiliated candidates, whereas the second treats all applicants uniformly by using a single cultural fit evaluation.
