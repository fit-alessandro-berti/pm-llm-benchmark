<thought>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to write a DuckDB query that meets all the given conditions. Let me parse the requirements again to make sure I understand each part.

First, the task has three main parts:

1. Identify cases where three specific activities occur in order: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order'. These must be consecutive in time for the case.

2. Among those cases, exclude those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Wait, no—the second point says to further refine the selection to only those cases where the time elapsed between those two events is more than 5 days. But then step 3 says to exclude those cases from the final result. Hmm, let me check again.

Wait the third point says: "After identifying such cases (the ones with the sequence and the time condition), exclude them from the final result." So the final result should exclude those cases that have the sequence AND the time condition. Wait the second point says "further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed... more than 5 days". So the cases that meet the sequence and the time condition are the ones we need to exclude. So the final result is all events except those cases.

Wait the third point says exactly that. So the process is:

- Find all cases that have the three activities in order (the sequence).

- Among those cases, check if the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is more than 5 days. Those cases are the ones to exclude. So the final result is all events except those cases' events.

Wait, but the problem says "exclude them from your final result", meaning the cases that meet both the sequence and the time condition. So the final result should include all events except those in those cases.

So the steps are:

1. Find all cases where the three activities occur in order (the sequence). Let's call these "target cases".

2. For those target cases, check if the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is more than 5 days. Let's call these "cases to exclude".

3. The final result is all events from the event_log except those in the "cases to exclude" cases.

Wait, but the problem says "after identifying such cases (the ones with the sequence and the timing condition) exclude them from the final result". So the final result is all events except those in the cases that meet both the sequence and the timing condition.

So the query needs to first find all events in the event_log that are not part of any case that has the sequence and meets the time condition.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me structure the approach.

First, to find the cases that have the three activities in order. For each case_id, check if there exists three consecutive events in the order Approve Purchase Requisition, then Create Order, then Confirm Order. The events must be in direct succession, so the timestamps must be in order and consecutive? Or just in order but not necessarily consecutive in time? Wait the problem says "direct succession" which probably means that the three events occur one after another without any other events from the same case in between. So the timestamps must be in order, and between the first and second event there's no other events from the same case, and between the second and third as well. Wait the problem states "three activities in direct succession" which implies that they happen one after the other without any other events from the same case in between. So the timestamps must be in order, and the events are consecutive in the case's event log.

Wait the exact wording: "three events from the same case in between them" — so between the first and second event, there can't be any other events from the same case. So the three events must be consecutive in the case's events. So the timestamps must be in order, and there are no other events from the same case between them.

So for a case_id, we need to find if there exists a sequence of three events where the first is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the second is 'Create Order', and the third is 'Confirm Order', and these three are consecutive in the case's events. The timestamps must be in order, and each step must follow immediately after the previous one in the case.

Alternatively, maybe "direct succession" just means in order, not necessarily consecutive events. But the problem says "with no other event from the same case in between them". So between the three events, there can't be any other events from the same case. So the three events must be consecutive in the case's events. So the timestamps must be in order, and between the first and second event, there are zero other events from the same case, and between the second and third also zero.

Therefore, for a case_id, we can group the events by case_id, sort them by timestamp, then check if there exists a triplet where the activities are in the required order and consecutive in the sorted list.

Alternatively, perhaps the events in the same case are already ordered by timestamp, so the consecutive events in the sorted list would be the ones in order. So the approach would be to group by case_id, then within each group, check if there exists three consecutive events with the required activities in order.

So first step: find all case_ids that have such a triplet.

Then, for those case_ids, check the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. The time elapsed between those two events must be more than 5 days. Wait, the problem says "the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is more than 5 days". So the duration between the two events must be >5 days. So if the Create Order happens, then after 5 days or more, the Confirm Order happens. So the time difference between the two events must be greater than 3600*24*5 = 43200 seconds, or 5 days in days.

Assuming the timestamp is in a format that DuckDB can handle, like a datetime or timestamp. So the calculation would be (confirm_order_timestamp - create_order_timestamp) > 5 days.

Once we have all the case_ids that meet the sequence and the time condition, we need to exclude all their events from the final result. The final result should be all events except those in those case_ids.

Wait, but the problem says "exclude them from your final result" where "them" refers to the cases that meet the criteria. So the final result is all events from event_log except those in the cases that have the sequence and the time condition.

Therefore, the approach is:

1. Find all case_ids that have the three activities in order (the sequence). Let's call this set S.

2. For each case_id in S, check if the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is more than 5 days. Let's call these case_ids T.

3. The final result is all events where case_id is not in T.

Wait, but the problem says "exclude them [the cases that meet the criteria] from the final result". The criteria are the sequence and the time condition. So the cases in T are those that have the sequence AND the time condition. So the final result is all events except those in T.

Wait, but the first step is to find all cases with the sequence (S), then among those, check the time condition (so the cases in T are a subset of S). So the final result is all events except those in T (since the problem says to exclude the cases that meet both the sequence and the time condition). Wait the problem says "exclude them from your final result" where "them" refers to the cases that have the sequence and the time condition. So yes, T is exactly those cases to exclude. So the final result is all events not in T.

Wait, but the problem's step 3 says "exclude them from your final result" where "them" are the cases that have the sequence and the time condition. Wait, the problem's step 2 says "further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is more than 5 days". So the cases that have the sequence AND the time condition are the ones to exclude. So yes, the final result is all events except those in T (the cases in T have the sequence and the time condition). So the final result is all events except those in T.

Wait, but the problem says "the cases that have this specific sequence" (the sequence) and then "further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed...". So the cases that meet both the sequence and the time condition are the ones to exclude. Therefore, the final result is all events except those in those cases.

Therefore, the steps are:

- Find all case_ids that have the three activities in order (sequence).

- Among those case_ids, check if their Create Order and Confirm Order events have a time difference >5 days. Those case_ids are to be excluded entirely.

Thus, the final query should return all events except those in those excluded case_ids.

Now, how to structure this in DuckDB.

First, to find the case_ids that have the sequence. Let's think about how to do that.

For each case_id, we need to check if there exists three consecutive events in the order: Approve Purchase Requisition, then Create Order, then Confirm Order. The events must be consecutive in the case's events (no other events in between), and their timestamps must be in order.

Assuming that within each case_id group, the events are ordered by timestamp (since the problem mentions "direct succession"), we can group by case_id, then within each group, check for the triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the events are not ordered, so we have to sort them by timestamp first. But the problem states "direct succession" which implies that there are no other events from the same case between them, so perhaps the events are already ordered in the table. But to be safe, perhaps we should sort them by timestamp within each case_id group.

So the approach for step 1 is:

Group the event_log by case_id, then for each group, sort the events by timestamp, then check if there exists three consecutive events in the required order.

Alternatively, perhaps using a window function or a subquery to find the triplet.

Alternatively, using a CTE (Common Table Expression) to find the cases with the sequence.

Let me think of the steps in SQL.

First, to find all case_ids that have the three activities in order:

We can use a window function over the events grouped by case_id. For each event in the group, we can look ahead and behind to see if the next two events are in order. But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, for each case_id, after sorting the events by timestamp, check if there exists a triplet where the first is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the second is 'Create Order', and the third is 'Confirm Order'.

So, for each case_id:

SELECT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT *, 
           LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity,
           LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
           -- but maybe better to check the next two?
    event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) subquery
WHERE there exists a row where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next activity is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

Hmm, perhaps using a window function to look ahead two steps.

Alternatively, for each event in the case_id group, check if the current activity is the first in the sequence, the next is the second, and the one after is the third.

Alternatively, using a self-join.

Another approach is to group by case_id and then, within each group, check for the presence of the triplet.

Let me think of the following steps in SQL:

First, group by case_id and order by timestamp (assuming that the events in the same case are already ordered by timestamp, but maybe need to enforce ordering).

Then, for each case_id group:

Check if there exists three consecutive rows where the activities are in the required order.

To do this, we can use a window function that looks ahead two steps. For example:

For each row in the case_id group, check if the current row's activity is the first in the sequence, the next row's activity is the second, and the row after that is the third.

So, for each row in the group, we can check the next two rows (if they exist) in the sorted list.

Alternatively, using a CTE where we generate a sequence of activities for each case_id.

Let me try to structure this.

First, group the events by case_id and order by timestamp (to ensure the events are in chronological order within each case):

WITH ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           timestamp,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sorted_events AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           timestamp,
           rn - 1 AS position_in_order  -- 1-based index
    FROM ordered_cases
    WHERE rn = 1
)
SELECT case_id
FROM sorted_events
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM sorted_events se2
    INNER JOIN sorted_events se1 ON se1.case_id = se2.case_id AND se1.position_in_order = se2.position_in_order - 1
    INNER JOIN sorted_events se3 ON se2.position_in_order = se3.position_in_order - 1
    AND se1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND se2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND se3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
);

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, for each case_id, after ordering by position_in_order, check if there exists a triplet where the activities are in the required order.

Alternatively, for each case_id group, after ordering by position_in_order (starting at 1), check if there's a position where the current activity is the first, next is second, next is third.

Alternatively, using a self-join where for each event in the case_id group, check if the next two events are in order.

But perhaps a better approach is to use a CTE that for each case_id and position, checks the next two positions.

Alternatively, using the following approach:

For each case_id group, after ordering by timestamp, iterate through the events and check for the triplet.

Another approach is to use a window function to get the next two activities.

Wait, perhaps using the LAG function multiple times.

Alternatively, here's a possible way:

For each case_id, after ordering by timestamp, check if there exists a row where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next row's activity is 'Create Order', and the row after that is 'Confirm Order'.

To do this, we can use a correlated subquery.

Let me try this:

SELECT case_id
FROM event_log l
JOIN event_log l2 ON l2.case_id = l.case_id AND l2.timestamp > l.timestamp
JOIN event_log l3 ON l3.case_id = l.case_id AND l3.timestamp > l2.timestamp
WHERE l.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND l2.activity = 'Create Order'
AND l3.activity = 'Confirm Order';

But this would find cases where there exists a triplet with exactly those three activities in order, but with any number of events in between. Wait no, because the timestamps must be in order. Wait the problem requires that the three events are in direct succession, meaning no other events from the same case between them. So the three events must be consecutive in the case's events. Therefore, the above approach would not work because it allows any events in between as long as their timestamps are in order. But the problem requires that there are no other events from the same case between them. So the timestamps must be in order, and between the three events, there are no other events from the same case. So the three events must be consecutive in the case's events.

Therefore, the approach must ensure that between the three events, there are no other events from the same case. So the timestamps must be in order, and the position in the case's events must be consecutive.

Therefore, the correct way is to group by case_id, sort the events by timestamp, then check for three consecutive events in the required order.

So here's the plan:

For each case_id:

1. Sort the events by timestamp.

2. Iterate through the sorted events, checking if there exists three consecutive events where the activities are in the required order.

To implement this in SQL, perhaps using a window function to assign positions and then check for the triplet.

Let me try this:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS pos
    FROM event_log
),
positions_with_activities AS (
    SELECT case_id, pos, activity
    FROM ordered_events
),
positions_sorted AS (
    SELECT case_id, pos, activity
    FROM positions_with_activities
    WHERE pos = MIN(pos) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)
)
SELECT case_id
FROM positions_sorted
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM positions_sorted ps2
    INNER JOIN positions_sorted ps1 ON ps1.case_id = ps2.case_id AND ps1.pos = ps2.pos - 1
    INNER JOIN positions_sorted ps3 ON ps2.pos = ps3.pos - 1
    AND ps1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND ps2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND ps3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
);

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, using a CTE that for each case_id, after ordering by position (starting at 1), checks if there exists a triplet where the activities are in order.

Alternatively, here's another approach:

For each case_id, after grouping and ordering by timestamp, the events are in order. So for each case_id, we can check if there exists three consecutive events in the order required.

To do this, for each case_id group:

Check if there exists a position where the activity is the first, next is second, next is third.

So for each case_id:

SELECT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
) sub AS s
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM (
        SELECT s1.case_id, s2.activity, s3.activity
        FROM s
        WHERE s.case_id = s1.case_id
          AND s.rn = s1.rn
          AND s.rn +1 = s2.rn
          AND s.rn +2 = s3.rn
    ) sub2
    WHERE s1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND s2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND s3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
);

Hmm, perhaps this is not the right way. Alternatively, using a window function to look ahead two steps.

Alternatively, using a correlated subquery:

For each event in the case_id group, check if the next two events are in order.

But how to do that?

Alternatively, here's a better approach using a window function to get the next two activities:

WITH ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sorted_activities AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           rn - 1 AS position_in_order  -- 1-based index
    FROM ordered_cases
    WHERE rn = 1  -- only the first event in the sorted list? Wait no, this would only take the first event of each case. Hmm, maybe this approach is not right.

Wait, perhaps the ordered_cases CTE gives each row with its row number within the case's ordered list. Then, for each row, we can check the next two rows (if they exist) to see if they form the triplet.

Alternatively, for each row in the ordered list (within a case), check if the current row is the first in the triplet, the next is the second, and the one after is the third.

So for each row in the case's ordered list (starting from position 1), check if:

current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition',

next activity is 'Create Order',

next next activity is 'Confirm Order'.

But how to get the next two activities?

Using LAG functions:

WITH ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT *,
           LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
           LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
           LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity
    FROM event_log
),
case_with_sequence AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           prev_activity,
           next_activity,
           next_next_activity,
           timestamp
    FROM ordered_cases
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND next_activity = 'Create Order' AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
)
SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM case_with_sequence;

Wait, this might work. Let me explain:

The ordered_cases CTE uses LAG to get the previous activity and LEAD to get the next activity. Then another LEAD to get the next next activity. Then, for any row where the current activity is the first in the sequence, the next is the second, and the next next is the third, we include that case_id.

But this approach would capture all instances where such a triplet exists, regardless of their positions. However, the problem requires that the three events are consecutive in the case's events. Wait, but the LAG and LEAD functions will look for the next activity in the entire sequence, not necessarily consecutive. For example, if there are other events between them, but their timestamps are in order, the LAG would still return those activities even if there are other events in between. But the problem requires that there are no other events from the same case between them. Therefore, this approach might not be correct.

Ah, right! The problem states that the three events must be in direct succession, meaning there are no other events from the same case between them. So the three events must be consecutive in the case's events. Therefore, the timestamp order must correspond to consecutive positions in the case's events.

Therefore, the correct approach must ensure that the three events are consecutive in the case's ordered list (by timestamp), and their activities are in the required order.

Therefore, the steps are:

For each case_id:

1. Sort the events by timestamp.

2. Iterate through the sorted events, checking if there exists three consecutive events where the activities are in the required order.

To do this in SQL:

We can use a window function to assign positions in the sorted list for each case_id. Then, for each position, check if the current position, position+1, and position+2 exist and their activities are in order.

Here's an attempt:

WITH ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS pos
    FROM event_log
),
positions_with_activities AS (
    SELECT case_id, pos, activity
    FROM ordered_cases
),
positions_sorted AS (
    SELECT case_id, pos, activity
    FROM positions_with_activities
    WHERE pos = MIN(pos) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)  -- This just gets the first row of each case, but maybe not needed
),
positions_with_positions AS (
    SELECT case_id, pos, activity, pos - 1 AS position_in_order
    FROM positions_with_activities
    WHERE pos = MIN(pos) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)  -- Not sure if needed
),
case_with_sequence AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           pos,
           activity,
           position_in_order
    FROM positions_with_activities
    WHERE pos = MIN(pos) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)  -- Only the first event in each case's sorted list? No, this would take the first event of each case, but we need all events.
)
Hmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let me think differently.

Another approach: For each case_id, after ordering by timestamp, check if there exists three consecutive rows where the activities are in the required order.

This can be done with a self-join where for each row in the case_id group, we check the next two rows (if they exist) to see if they form the triplet.

For example:

WITH ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
case_events AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           rn - 1 AS position_in_order  -- 1-based index within the case's sorted events
    FROM ordered_cases
    WHERE rn = 1  -- Only the first event in the sorted list? No, this would miss all other events. Hmm, this approach is not correct.
),
all_case_events AS (
    SELECT ce.case_id, ce.position_in_order, ce.activity
    FROM case_events ce
    JOIN ordered_cases oc ON ce.case_id = oc.case_id AND ce.position_in_order = oc.rn -1
)
SELECT case_id
FROM all_case_events
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM all_case_events ae1
    INNER JOIN all_case_events ae2 ON ae2.case_id = ae1.case_id AND ae2.position_in_order = ae1.position_in_order +1
    INNER JOIN all_case_events ae3 ON ae3.case_id = ae1.case_id AND ae3.position_in_order = ae2.position_in_order +1
    AND ae1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND ae2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND ae3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
);

This might work. Let me explain:

The ordered_cases CTE assigns a row number (rn) to each event in the case_id's sorted list (ordered by timestamp). Then, case_events CTE takes each event and calculates its position_in_order as rn-1 (so 1-based index). Then, all_case_events joins ordered_cases to case_events to ensure that the position_in_order matches the rn-1. Then, for each case_id, we check if there exists three consecutive positions where the activities are in the required order.

This should work because the positions_in_order are consecutive and in order of the timestamps. So if there are three consecutive positions with the required activities, then those three events are consecutive in the case's events and in the required order.

Now, this gives us the case_ids that have the triplet. Next step is to find for those case_ids the time between Create Order and Confirm Order events.

Assuming that in the triplet, the Create Order is the second event and Confirm Order is the third, then the time between them is (Confirm Order's timestamp - Create Order's timestamp). We need this difference to be more than 5 days.

So for each case_id in the first step's result, we need to find the timestamps of the Create Order and Confirm Order events in their triplet and compute the difference.

Let's proceed step by step.

First, the case_ids that have the triplet are obtained via the previous CTE. Let's call this result set 'target_cases'.

Then, for each target_case, find the Create Order and Confirm Order events in their triplet.

Assuming that in the triplet, the Create Order is the second event and Confirm Order is the third, then their timestamps are known.

So for each such case_id, we can find the timestamp of the Create Order event (second in the triplet) and the Confirm Order event (third), compute the difference, and check if it's >5 days.

To do this:

We can join the triplet events for each case_id and extract those events.

Let me try this:

WITH ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
case_events AS (
    SELECT ce.case_id, ce.position_in_order, ce.activity
    FROM ordered_cases ce
    JOIN ordered_cases oc ON ce.case_id = oc.case_id AND ce.position_in_order = oc.rn -1
),
triplet_events AS (
    SELECT ce.case_id,
           ce.position_in_order,
           ce.activity,
           ce.timestamp
    FROM case_events ce
    INNER JOIN case_events ce2 ON ce2.position_in_order = ce.position_in_order +1
    INNER JOIN case_events ce3 ON ce2.position_in_order = ce3.position_in_order +1
    WHERE ce.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND ce2.activity = 'Create Order' AND ce3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
target_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM triplet_events
),
time_diff AS (
    SELECT 
        te.case_id,
        (te.timestamp - (te2.timestamp)) AS time_diff_days  -- Wait need to get the Create Order and Confirm Order timestamps
    FROM triplet_events te
    INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
    INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_create.position_in_order = te_confirm.position_in_order +1
)
SELECT case_id FROM target_cases
WHERE time_diff_days > INTERVAL '5 days';

Wait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to structure it properly.

The triplet_events CTE already has the three events in the triplet. For each case_id in triplet_events, the Create Order is the second event (position_in_order +1) and Confirm Order is the third (position_in_order +2). So for each triplet_event in triplet_events, the Create Order is the next event after the first (Approve), and Confirm is after Create.

Therefore, for each triplet_event in triplet_events:

The Create Order event has position_in_order = current event's position_in_order +1.

The Confirm Order event has position_in_order = current event's position_in_order +2.

Therefore, to get the Create and Confirm timestamps for each case_id:

We can join the triplet_events to themselves.

For example:

SELECT te.case_id,
       te_create.timestamp AS create_time,
       te_confirm.timestamp AS confirm_time
FROM triplet_events te
JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
WHERE te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order';

This would give for each case_id the timestamps of the Create and Confirm events in their triplet.

Then, compute the difference between confirm_time and create_time, and check if it's more than 5 days.

Putting this together:

WITH ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
case_events AS (
    SELECT ce.case_id, ce.position_in_order, ce.activity
    FROM ordered_cases ce
    JOIN ordered_cases oc ON ce.case_id = oc.case_id AND ce.position_in_order = oc.rn -1
),
triplet_events AS (
    SELECT ce.case_id,
           ce.position_in_order,
           ce.activity,
           ce.timestamp
    FROM case_events ce
    INNER JOIN case_events ce_create ON ce_create.position_in_order = ce.position_in_order +1
    INNER JOIN case_events ce_confirm ON ce_confirm.position_in_order = ce_create.position_in_order +1
    WHERE ce.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND ce_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND ce_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
case_with_timediff AS (
    SELECT 
        te.case_id,
        (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM triplet_events te
    INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
    INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
)
SELECT case_id FROM triplet_events
WHERE time_diff_seconds > INTERVAL '5 days' * INTERVAL 1 DAY;

Wait, but the time_diff_seconds is in seconds (assuming timestamp is in seconds). Wait, DuckDB's INTERVAL uses days as INTERVAL '1 day'. So to check if the difference is more than 5 days, we can compute:

time_diff_seconds > (5 * 86400) seconds.

Alternatively, using the interval function:

time_diff_seconds > INTERVAL '5 days' * INTERVAL '1 day' ?

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done using the actual timestamp differences. Let's see.

Assuming the timestamp is in a format that DuckDB can handle as a timestamp or datetime. Let's say it's a TIMESTAMP type.

Then, the difference between two timestamps can be calculated as (confirm_time - create_time). If this difference is greater than 5 days, then it's acceptable.

So in the case_with_timediff CTE:

SELECT 
    te.case_id,
    (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
FROM triplet_events te
INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2;

Then, filter where time_diff_days > 5.

Putting it all together:

WITH ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
case_events AS (
    SELECT ce.case_id, ce.position_in_order, ce.activity
    FROM ordered_cases ce
    JOIN ordered_cases oc ON ce.case_id = oc.case_id AND ce.position_in_order = oc.rn -1
),
triplet_events AS (
    SELECT ce.case_id,
           ce.position_in_order,
           ce.activity,
           ce.timestamp
    FROM case_events ce
    INNER JOIN case_events ce_create ON ce_create.position_in_order = ce.position_in_order +1
    INNER JOIN case_events ce_confirm ON ce_confirm.position_in_order = ce_create.position_in_order +1
    WHERE ce.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND ce_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND ce_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
time_diff AS (
    SELECT 
        te.case_id,
        (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
    FROM triplet_events te
    INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
    INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
)
SELECT case_id FROM triplet_events
WHERE time_diff.case_id IS NOT NULL AND time_diff.time_diff_days > 5;

Wait, but the time_diff CTE would only return rows where the triplet exists for the case_id, so the WHERE clause in the final SELECT can just check the triplet exists (i.e., the triplet_events row exists) and the time_diff is >5 days.

Alternatively, the final step is to select case_ids from triplet_events where the time_diff is >5 days.

But the time_diff CTE can be simplified by joining directly:

SELECT te.case_id
FROM triplet_events te
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT te_create.case_id, (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
    FROM triplet_events te
    INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
    INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
    WHERE te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
) td ON te.case_id = td.case_id AND td.time_diff_days >5
GROUP BY te.case_id;

This might be more efficient.

Once we have the case_ids that meet both the sequence and the time condition (the final SELECT above), those case_ids need to be excluded from the final result. The final result should return all events except those in those case_ids.

Therefore, the final query is:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id FROM (
        -- the query that finds the case_ids to exclude
        SELECT case_id
        FROM triplet_events te
        INNER JOIN (
            SELECT te_create.case_id, (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
            FROM triplet_events te
            INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
            INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
            WHERE te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
        ) td ON te.case_id = td.case_id AND te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    ) td
)
ORDER BY event_log.timestamp;

Wait, but this approach might have some redundancy. Alternatively, the case_ids to exclude can be obtained by:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM (
    SELECT te.case_id
    FROM triplet_events te
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT te_create.case_id, (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
        FROM triplet_events te
        INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
        INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
        WHERE te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
    ) td ON te.case_id = td.case_id AND te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
) exclude_case;

Then, the final query excludes those case_ids.

But this might be redundant because the FROM clause already includes the triplet_events, so the JOIN with td would only match when the time condition is met. So the DISTINCT is needed to avoid duplicates if a case has multiple triplets (unlikely, but possible?).

Alternatively, the case_ids to exclude can be obtained by:

SELECT case_id
FROM triplet_events te
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT te_create.case_id, (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
    FROM triplet_events te
    INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
    INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
    WHERE te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
) td ON te.case_id = td.case_id AND te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
GROUP BY case_id;

This would give all case_ids that have at least one triplet meeting the time condition.

Putting it all together, the final query is:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM triplet_events te
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT te_create.case_id, (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
        FROM triplet_events te
        INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
        INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
        WHERE te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
    ) td ON te.case_id = td.case_id AND te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
)
ORDER BY event_log.timestamp;

But this might be very inefficient due to the nested queries and joins. However, given the constraints of DuckDB's SQL dialect, this might be the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more optimized way. Let me think of another approach.

Another way to structure the final query:

First, identify all events that are not part of any case that has the triplet and meets the time condition.

So the steps are:

1. Find all events in the event_log that belong to cases which do NOT have the triplet, OR have the triplet but the time between Create and Confirm is <=5 days.

These events should be included in the final result.

Alternatively, the final result is all events except those in cases that have the triplet and the time condition.

So the final query can be written as:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id FROM (
        SELECT case_id
        FROM (
            SELECT te.case_id
            FROM triplet_events te
            INNER JOIN (
                SELECT te_create.case_id, (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
                FROM triplet_events te
                INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
                INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
                WHERE te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
            ) td ON te.case_id = td.case_id AND te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        ) exclude_case
    ) exclude_case_set
)
ORDER BY event_log.timestamp;

This way, we first get all case_ids that have the triplet and meet the time condition (exclude_case_set), then exclude those case_ids entirely from the result.

This should work.

Now, let's check for possible errors or optimizations.

One thing to note is that the triplet_events CTE includes all cases that have the triplet, but when joining with the time condition, we need to ensure that we're only considering those cases where the time difference is >5 days.

Another possible optimization is to precompute the case_ids that meet the time condition once and then join.

Alternatively, the inner query in the FROM clause for exclude_case_set can be simplified by directly selecting the case_ids from triplet_events where the time condition is met.

Putting it all together, the final query should look something like this:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT te.case_id
        FROM triplet_events te
        INNER JOIN (
            SELECT te_create.case_id, (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
            FROM triplet_events te
            INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
            INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
            WHERE te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
        ) td ON te.case_id = td.case_id AND te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    ) exclude_case_set
)
ORDER BY event_log.timestamp;

But this might be redundant because the FROM clause already includes the triplet_events, so the JOIN with td would only match when the time condition is met. However, the WHERE clause in the FROM clause ensures that te.activity is the first in the triplet, etc. So the final query should correctly exclude all events in cases that have the triplet and meet the time condition.

Another possible issue is that the triplet_events may have multiple triplets per case_id, but the exclude_case_set will include the case_id once if any of its triplets meet the time condition.

Now, testing for possible errors:

- The triplet_events CTE correctly identifies all cases with the triplet in order.

- The inner query for exclude_case_set correctly calculates the time difference for each triplet and includes the case_id if any of its triplets meet the time condition.

- The final SELECT excludes those case_ids entirely.

This should satisfy the problem's requirements.

Now, let's write the final query with proper syntax and structure.

The problem requires that the final query returns all events except those in cases that have the triplet and meet the time condition. The above query does that.

But perhaps the order of the joins and the use of the CTE can be optimized for readability.

Alternatively, the final query can be structured as follows:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE NOT (
    SELECT 1 FROM (
        SELECT case_id
        FROM (
            SELECT te.case_id
            FROM triplet_events te
            INNER JOIN (
                SELECT te_create.case_id, (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
                FROM triplet_events te
                INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +1
                INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order +2
                WHERE te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
            ) td ON te.case_id = td.case_id AND te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        ) exclude_case_set
    ) exclude_case
    WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM exclude_case_set)
)
ORDER BY event_log.timestamp;

This uses a subquery in the WHERE clause to check if the case_id is in the exclude_case_set.

But this might be less efficient than the previous approach.

Alternatively, the initial approach is better.

Now, considering all the steps and possible syntax, here's the final answer:
</thought>

```sql
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT te.case_id
        FROM triplet_events te
        INNER JOIN (
            SELECT te_create.case_id, (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) AS time_diff_days
            FROM triplet_events te
            INNER JOIN triplet_events te_create ON te.case_id = te_create.case_id AND te_create.position_in_order = te.position_in_order + 1
            INNER JOIN triplet_events te_confirm ON te_confirm.case_id = te.case_id AND te_confirm.position_in_order = te.position_in_order + 2
            WHERE te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
                AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' 
                AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order' 
                AND (te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
        ) td ON te.case_id = td.case_id AND te.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND te_create.activity = 'Create Order' AND te_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    ) exclude_case_set
)
ORDER BY event_log.timestamp;
```
