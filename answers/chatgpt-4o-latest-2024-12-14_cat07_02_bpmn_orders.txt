This visualization is a **BPMN diagram** (Business Process Model and Notation) that represents a business process for handling customer orders in a company. The diagram includes four main lanes (departments or roles) involved in the process: **Sales**, **Production**, **Procurement**, and **Warehouse**. Here's an explanation of each section and the flow:

---

### **1. Sales Lane**
This lane describes the activities related to handling customer orders:
- **Start Event (Monday Morning):** Indicates the process starts at the beginning of the week.
- **Check Order for Completeness:** Sales staff check if the customerâ€™s order contains all necessary details.
- **Check if Customer is Already in the Database:**
  - If the customer is **not in the database**, they are added.
  - If the customer is **already in the database**, the process continues.
- **Send Order Details:** Once the order is validated, the details are sent to the production department.
- **Draft Invoice:** After sending the order details, an invoice is drafted for the customer.

---

### **2. Production Lane**
This lane details how production handles incoming order details:
- **Plan Production:** Production staff plan how the product will be manufactured.
- **Check Materials:** If the required materials are not faulty or unavailable, production can proceed.
  - If materials are faulty or missing, a signal is sent to the procurement department to initiate material compensation.
- **Manufacture Product:** If everything is in order, the product is manufactured.
- **Product Complete:** Once manufacturing is complete, the product is marked as complete.

---

### **3. Procurement Lane**
This lane explains the procurement process for obtaining and verifying materials:
- **Material Compensation Subprocess:** Triggered if materials are missing or faulty.
  - **Order Materials:** New materials are ordered.
  - **Return Material:** Faulty materials are returned if necessary.
- **Check Materials:** Ensures the received materials meet quality standards.
- **Order Cancellation:** If the materials are still inadequate, the order may be canceled.

### **4. Warehouse Lane**
This lane covers the steps in handling the finished product:
- **Send Product:** After production is complete, the product is sent to the customer.
- **End Event (Product Sent):** Indicates the process ends once the product is successfully shipped.

---

### **Cross-Lane Interactions**
- **Dashed Lines:** Represent messages or information flow between departments (e.g., order details sent from Sales to Production, production completion signal sent to the Warehouse).
- **Subprocesses:** The procurement process includes a nested "Material Compensation Subprocess," showing a more detailed view of handling faulty or missing materials.

This BPMN diagram effectively maps out the entire workflow of processing customer orders, ensuring clear responsibilities across departments and identifying decision points (e.g., customer checks, material quality checks).
