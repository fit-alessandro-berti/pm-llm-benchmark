Based on the process variants you provided, there are several differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group. Here are a few key points:

1. Process Choice: The protected group seems to have a higher preference for certain process variants, such as "Register at ER -> Expert Examination" and "Register at FD -> Expert Examination," which have higher frequencies and better performance. The unprotected group, on the other hand, has a more even distribution of process choices.

2. Execution Time: The protected group has a higher average execution time across all process variants, with a mean of 260006.914, compared to the unprotected group with a mean of 160001.627.

3. Treatment Outcomes: Both groups have a few process variants where the treatment is unsuccessful. However, the protected group has more process variants where the treatment is successful, with a higher frequency. This suggests that the protected group may have a higher success rate in treatment.

4. Thorough Examination: Both groups have process variants that include "Thorough Examination," but the protected group has a higher frequency and better performance for this step. This suggests that the protected group may prioritize thorough examinations during the treatment process.

5. Discharge: Both groups have process variants where the patient is discharged, but the protected group has a higher frequency for this step. This suggests that the protected group may have a higher success rate in discharging patients.

These differences suggest that the protected group may have a more favorable treatment process, characterized by higher success rates, better execution times, and a more systematic approach. However, it's important to consider other factors and perform further analysis to fully understand the differences and any potential unfairness.
