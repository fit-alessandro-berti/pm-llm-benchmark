Based on the process variants provided for the protected and unprotected groups, we can identify several key differences in treatment and care processes between the two groups.

1. Registration Process:
- In the protected group, there are several instances where patients are registered at the emergency room (ER) or family doctor (FD) before proceeding with the examination and treatment process. However, in the unprotected group, the registration process is mainly at the FD, indicating a difference in access to healthcare services or referral patterns.

2. Examination and Diagnosis:
- Both groups follow similar steps of examination and diagnosis before proceeding with treatment. However, the frequency of expert examinations is higher in the protected group compared to the unprotected group, indicating potentially more thorough evaluation for the protected group.

3. Treatment and Success Rate:
- The treatment process in both groups includes similar steps such as treatment administration, successful treatment outcomes, and discharge. However, the performance times for treatment and successful discharge are generally higher in the protected group, suggesting potential prioritization or better quality of care for this group.

4. Treatment Unsuccessful Cases:
- The unprotected group has a higher frequency of treatment unsuccessful cases compared to the protected group. This may indicate potential discrepancies in the treatment approach, resources, or follow-up care for the two groups.

5. Thorough Examination:
- The unprotected group has instances of thorough examination included in the process variants, which are not as prominent in the protected group. This could suggest a more comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment for the unprotected group, potentially compensating for other disparities in care.

Overall, the main differences in the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups lie in the registration process, access to expert examinations, treatment outcomes, and the presence of thorough examination steps. These differences may reflect disparities in healthcare resources, quality of care, or patient prioritization based on the group's protected status.
