### BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

The process begins when an **Invoice** is received, either by email or other means, and is passed to the **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)** for initial processing.

### Activities and Sequence Flow:

1. **Receive Invoice**:
	- Activity: Receive and review invoice for validity.
	- Participants: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
	- Artifact: Invoice (email/document).
	- Roles/Participants: Supplier (sender of the invoice).
2. **Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO)**:
	- Decision Point: Does the invoice have a valid PO number?
		- If **Yes**: Proceed to Log Invoice.
		- If **No**: Send the invoice back to the supplier for additional details.
	- Roles/Participants: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Supplier.
3. **Log Invoice in Accounting System**:
	- Activity: Enter invoice details into the system, linking it to the PO if applicable.
	- Participants: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
	- Artifact: Invoice.
4. **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**:
	- Activity: Send invoice to Purchasing for confirmation of goods/services receipt.
	- Participants: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan).
	- Gateway:
		- If confirmed receipt: Proceed to Match Line Items.
		- If discrepancies noted, escalate for clarification (e.g., to Accounts Payable Supervisor or Manager).
5. **Match Line Items to PO**:
	- Activity: Compare invoice details (quantities, prices) with the PO.
	- Gateway:
		- If match: Proceed to Manager Approval.
		- If discrepancies (e.g., incorrect pricing or missing items): Resolve issues with Purchasing or escalate.
	- Roles/Participants: Purchasing Officer (Dan), Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Supervisor (if escalation required).
6. **Escalation for Exceptions**:
	- Activity: Resolve exceptions such as missing POs or significant pricing discrepancies.
	- Participants: Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).
	- Roles/Participants: Department Head (for informal contracts), Supplier (via Supplier Relationship Manager).
7. **Manager Approval**:
	- Activity: Send invoice to department manager for final approval.
	- Artifact: Approved invoice.
	- Participants: Department Manager (Carlos).
	- Trigger: System-generated notification after matching and confirmation.
8. **Schedule for Payment**:
	- Activity: Submit approved invoice for payment scheduling.
	- Participants: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
	- Artifact: Approved invoice.

### Exceptions and Variations:

- If discrepancies cannot be resolved, the Supervisor may escalate to department heads or create retrospective POs.
- If the invoice lacks a PO entirely, it is sent back to Purchasing for clarification, potentially involving the Supplier Relationship Manager to liaise with the supplier.

### Roles and Responsibilities:

- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**: Handles initial invoice review, logging, and scheduling for payment. Escalates exceptions.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**: Confirms receipt of goods/services against POs and resolves discrepancies with suppliers if needed.
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**: Reviews and approves invoices after confirmation and matching.
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**: Manages exceptions and escalations.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**: Assists in resolving supplier-related issues, such as missing POs or pricing discrepancies.

### Artifacts and Inputs/Outputs:

- **Inputs**: Invoice, Purchase Order (PO), Supplier communication.
- **Outputs**: Approved invoice, payment schedule.

### Notes and Ambiguities:

- Discrepancies in PO matching may involve multiple feedback loops between Accounts Payable and Purchasing.
- Informal contracts may require additional steps involving department heads and the Supervisor.
- Payment scheduling is implied but not detailed in the interviews.
