Certainly! Below is a sample DECLARE model for an hypothetical "Purchase-to-Pay" process in pm4py. This example includes activities such as `Order`, `Invoice`, `Payment`, and the constraints mentioned:

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Order': 1.0,
        'Invoice': 1.0,
        'Payment': 1.0
    },
    'absence': {
        'Duplicate_Order': 1.0,  # If this activity exists, no other order is allowed.
        'Missing_Invoice': 1.0   # If this activity exists, the invoice must be present.
    },
    'exactly_one': {},
    'init': {
        'Order': True,
        'Invoice': True
    },
    'responded_existence': {'Order': {}, 'Invoice': {}},
    'coexistence': {},
    'response': {'Order': {}, 'Invoice': {}},
    'precedence': {'Invoice': {'Order'}, 'Payment': {'Invoice'}},
    'succession': {
        'Order': {'Invoice'},
        'Invoice': {'Payment'}
    },
    'altresponse': {'Order': {}, 'Invoice': {}},
    'altprecedence': {'Invoice': {'Order'}, 'Payment': {'Invoice'}},
    'altsuccession': {
        'Order': {},
        'Invoice': {}
    },
    'chainresponse': {'Invoice': {}, 'Order': {}},
    'chainprecedence': {'Invoice': {'Order'}, 'Payment': {'Invoice'}},
    'chainsuccession': {
        'Order': {},
        'Invoice': {}
    },
    'noncoexistence': {'Order': {}, 'Invoice': {}},
    'nonsuccession': {'Invoice': {}, 'Order': {}},
    'nonchainsuccession': {'Order': {}, 'Invoice': {}}
}

print(json.dumps(declare_model, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
- **Existence**: Each activity is explicitly marked as existing with a confidence of 1.0.
- **Absence**: Each absence constraint is set to exist if and only if the corresponding `existence` rule exists.
- **Exactly One**: No activities are specified to have exactly one occurrence in this example.
- **Initialization**: The trace starts with an order being placed, indicated by setting its existence flag to True.
- **Responded Existence**: This constraint is not used in this example.
- **Co-Existence**: This constraint is not present as the processes do not involve mutual exclusion between activities.
- **Response**: Similarly, response constraints are not applicable here.
- **Precedence**: The invoice must be before the payment.
- **Succession**: Orders lead to invoices, and invoices lead to payments.
- **Alternate Response/Precedence/Accuracy (depending on the use case)**: These alternate rules are not applied in this example because we're focusing on a single trace.
- **Chain Response/Succession/Accuracy**: This is also simplified for simplicity.

This model sets up the basic structure for an hypothetical "Purchase-to-Pay" process with the constraints and relationships you've outlined. You can further extend or modify it based on your specific requirements.
