## Analysis of Event Log Compliance

### 1. **Normative Rule Violations (Serious Issues)**

#### **Case 1:**  **COMPLIANT**
- Follows the complete normative sequence correctly
- All activities occur in the required order
- Loan was approved, so documentation was properly finalized before closing
- No normative violations detected

#### **Case 2:**  **NON-COMPLIANT - Multiple Violations**

**Violations identified:**
1. **Sequence Violation:** Risk Assessment (08:20) occurred before Credit Check (09:00)
   - This directly violates the mandatory ordering rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment
   
2. **Missing Required Activity:** No "Inform Applicant" activity recorded
   - The normative process requires informing the applicant after the loan decision
   
3. **Inappropriate Activity:** Finalize Documentation performed after loan rejection
   - The rules explicitly state that documentation should NOT be finalized when a loan is rejected
   
These violations suggest serious process control issues in Case 2, potentially indicating manual overrides or system failures.

#### **Case 3:**  **COMPLIANT**
- All normative rules are followed correctly
- Activities occur in the required sequence
- Loan was approved and documentation was properly finalized before closing

### 2. **Desiderata Violations (Recommended Practices)**

#### **Case 1:** 
-  **Missing Follow-up Call** - No follow-up call recorded before case closure
-  Credit Check timing: Performed within 30 minutes (well within 24-hour recommendation)
-  Inform Applicant timing: Done within 2 hours of decision (well within 48-hour recommendation)

#### **Case 2:**
-  **Missing Follow-up Call** - No follow-up call recorded
- Note: Timing desiderata are not evaluated here as the case has fundamental normative violations

#### **Case 3:**
-  **Credit Check Delay:** Performed 49 hours after application receipt (recommended: within 24 hours)
-  **Inform Applicant Delay:** Done 51 hours after loan decision (recommended: within 48 hours)  
-  **Missing Follow-up Call** - No follow-up call recorded

### 3. **Interpretations and Recommendations**

**Case 1 Interpretation:**
This case represents ideal normative compliance with minor room for improvement in customer service (adding a follow-up call). The quick processing times suggest an efficient, well-functioning system.

**Case 2 Interpretation:**
This case shows systemic failures that require immediate attention:
- The reversal of Credit Check and Risk Assessment suggests either:
  - A system configuration error
  - Manual intervention bypassing standard controls
  - Training issues with staff
- The finalization of documentation after rejection could indicate:
  - A misunderstanding of rejection procedures
  - System automation errors
  - Potential fraud risk (attempting to process rejected loans)

**Recommended Actions for Case 2:**
- Investigate root cause of sequence violations
- Implement system controls to prevent out-of-sequence activities
- Add validation rules to prevent documentation finalization on rejected loans
- Ensure proper notification procedures are followed

**Case 3 Interpretation:**
While normatively compliant, the delays suggest resource constraints or workload issues:
- The 2-day delay for Credit Check might indicate:
  - Weekend/holiday interruption (Jan 12 was Friday, Jan 14 was Sunday/Monday)
  - Backlog in credit checking department
  - System availability issues

**Recommended Actions for Case 3:**
- Review resource allocation for credit checking
- Consider implementing automated reminders for time-sensitive activities
- Establish service level agreements (SLAs) aligned with desiderata timings

### Summary
- **Case 1:** Normatively compliant, minor desiderata gaps
- **Case 2:** Serious normative violations requiring immediate corrective action
- **Case 3:** Normatively compliant but with timing inefficiencies that should be addressed for optimal service delivery
