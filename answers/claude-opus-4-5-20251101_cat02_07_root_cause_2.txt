# Insurance Claims Processing - Performance Analysis

## 1. Case Duration Analysis

Let me first calculate the total duration for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Duration | Complexity | Region |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 2001 | 2024-04-01 09:00 | 2024-04-01 10:30 | **1.5 hours** | Low | A |
| 2002 | 2024-04-01 09:05 | 2024-04-02 11:00 | **~26 hours** | Medium | B |
| 2003 | 2024-04-01 09:10 | 2024-04-03 09:30 | **~48 hours** | High | A |
| 2004 | 2024-04-01 09:20 | 2024-04-01 10:45 | **1.4 hours** | Low | B |
| 2005 | 2024-04-01 09:25 | 2024-04-04 14:30 | **~77 hours** | High | B |

### Cases with Performance Issues:
- **Case 2005** (77 hours) - **Most problematic**
- **Case 2003** (48 hours) - **Significantly delayed**
- **Case 2002** (26 hours) - **Moderately delayed**

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### A. Complexity as Primary Driver

| Complexity | Avg Duration | Document Requests | Cases |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Low** | ~1.45 hours | 0 | 2001, 2004 |
| **Medium** | ~26 hours | 1 | 2002 |
| **High** | ~62.5 hours | 2-3 | 2003, 2005 |

**Finding:** There is a **strong correlation between complexity and duration**:
- High-complexity claims take **~43x longer** than low-complexity claims
- Each additional document request adds approximately **20-24 hours** to the process

### B. Document Request Pattern Analysis

| Case ID | Complexity | # of Document Requests | Time Between Requests |
|---------|------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| 2001 | Low | 0 | N/A |
| 2002 | Medium | 1 | N/A |
| 2003 | High | 2 | 6 hours |
| 2004 | Low | 0 | N/A |
| 2005 | High | 3 | 29.5 hrs, 22 hrs |

**Finding:** High-complexity cases trigger **multiple document requests**, each creating significant waiting time for customer responses.

### C. Resource Analysis

| Resource | Cases Handled | Avg Processing Time | Issues Noted |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Adjuster_Mike | 2001, 2003 | Variable | 2 doc requests for high complexity |
| Adjuster_Lisa | 2002, 2004, 2005 | Variable | 3 doc requests for Case 2005 |
| Manager_Bill | 2003, 2005 | Longer approval delays | Handles high-complexity approvals |
| Manager_Ann | 2001, 2002, 2004 | Faster approvals | Handles low/medium complexity |

**Finding:** 
- **Adjuster_Lisa** handled Case 2005 with **3 separate document requests**, suggesting either:
  - Incomplete initial document requests
  - Difficulty gathering all requirements upfront for complex cases
- **Manager_Bill** exclusively handles high-complexity approvals, creating a potential bottleneck

### D. Region Analysis

| Region | Cases | Avg Duration | Complexity Mix |
|--------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| A | 2001, 2003 | ~24.75 hrs | Low, High |
| B | 2002, 2004, 2005 | ~34.8 hrs | Medium, Low, High |

**Finding:** Region B appears slower on average, but this is **confounded by complexity distribution**. When controlling for complexity:
- Low complexity: Region A (1.5 hrs)  Region B (1.4 hrs)
- High complexity: Region A (48 hrs) < Region B (77 hrs)

**Region B shows longer processing for high-complexity cases**, possibly due to Adjuster_Lisa's multiple document request pattern.

## 3. Root Cause Summary

```

                    ROOT CAUSE HIERARCHY                        

 PRIMARY: Claim Complexity                                       
    High complexity  Multiple document requests              
          Each request adds ~24 hours wait time               
                                                                 
 SECONDARY: Document Request Inefficiency                        
    Adjuster_Lisa: 3 separate requests for Case 2005         
    Documents not requested comprehensively upfront          
                                                                 
 TERTIARY: Resource Bottleneck                                   
    Manager_Bill: Only approver for high-complexity cases    
    Potential capacity constraint

## 4. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

| Issue | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Multiple document requests** | Create comprehensive checklists for high-complexity claims to request all documents upfront | Reduce 2-3 requests to 1, saving 24-48 hours |
| **Manager_Bill bottleneck** | Cross-train Manager_Ann on high-complexity approvals | Reduce approval wait times |
| **Long customer response times** | Implement automated reminders and customer portal for document uploads | Reduce wait time per request |

### Process Improvements

1. **Complexity-Based Routing:**
   - Automatically flag high-complexity claims for senior adjusters
   - Pre-populate document request templates based on complexity level

2. **Parallel Processing:**
   - Begin preliminary approval work while awaiting documents
   - Allow conditional approvals pending document verification

3. **Resource Training:**
   - Train Adjuster_Lisa on comprehensive upfront document assessment
   - Share best practices from Adjuster_Mike (fewer requests per case)

4. **SLA Implementation:**
   | Complexity | Target Duration | Current Avg |
   |------------|-----------------|-------------|
   | Low | 2 hours | 1.45 hours  |
   | Medium | 8 hours | 26 hours  |
   | High | 24 hours | 62.5 hours  |

## Conclusion

The **primary root cause** of performance issues is **claim complexity**, which drives multiple document requests. However, the **controllable factor** is the **efficiency of document collection** - specifically, Adjuster_Lisa's pattern of making multiple sequential requests rather than comprehensive upfront requests. Addressing this through better checklists and training could reduce high-complexity case durations by **40-50%**.
