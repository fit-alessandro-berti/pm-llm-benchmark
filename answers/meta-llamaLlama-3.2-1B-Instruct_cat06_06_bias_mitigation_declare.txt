**Explanation:**

We identified a potential bias in the loan application process, where the sequence of activities could be influenced by sensitive attributes like ApplicantRace: Minority. We added new constraints to mitigate this bias by enforcing fairness in the process.

These constraints include:

1.  **Coexistence:** Ensuring that decision steps (e.g., Approve, Reject) always coexist with manual reviews, regardless of the sensitive attribute disclosed.
2.  **Response or Succession Constraints:** Ensuring that decisions (e.g., Approve, Reject) cannot immediately follow an activity disclosing sensitive attributes, and that certain decisions (e.g., Approve, Reject) must be preceded by an activity that coexists with the sensitive attribute.
3.  **Non-succession Constraints:** Preventing a direct succession from sensitive attribute events to decision events, ensuring that there are sufficient additional checks in place to mitigate bias.
4.  **Prevention:** Ensuring that prevention constraints are applied before sensitive attribute events (e.g., CheckApplicantRace) and that alternatives are available to mitigate bias in those cases.
5.  **Alternatives:** Ensuring that alternatives are available to mitigate bias in decisions that require additional checks (e.g., CheckApplicantRace).

By adding these constraints, we have effectively mitigated the bias in the loan application process and ensured that decisions are fair and consistent.
