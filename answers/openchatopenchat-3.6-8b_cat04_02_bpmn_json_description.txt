This BPMN model represents a process flow involving various medical procedures. The process begins with a Start Event, followed by a series of tasks, including preparing implements, hand washing, getting in sterile clothes, cleaning the puncture area, draping the puncture area, ultrasound configuration, gel in probe, covering the probe, putting sterile gel, positioning the probe, and positioning the patient.

An Exclusive Gateway serves as a diverging point in the process, leading to the identification of Doppler, anatomic, and compression. Subsequently, another Exclusive Gateway serves as a converging point, followed by the task of anesthetizing.

Next, an Exclusive Gateway serves as another diverging point, leading to tasks such as puncturing, removing the guidewire, checking the flow and reflow, and checking the catheter position. The process concludes with an End Event.

SequenceFlows in the model represent the flow of the process,
