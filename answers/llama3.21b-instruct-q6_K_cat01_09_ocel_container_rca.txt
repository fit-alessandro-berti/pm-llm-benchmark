After examining the provided data, here are some potential root causes related to the performance issues:

1. **Inconsistent data frequency**:
	* The frequency of "Load to Vehicle" and "Weigh" is higher than others in terms of object count or duration. This may limit the processing time for these steps.
	* A lower number of events with a very short duration might indicate that the system is not fully utilizing available instances.
2. **Insufficient parallelization**:
	* The data distribution does not seem to be optimized, leading to sequential execution of tasks (e.g., "Load to Vehicle" being called 1753 times while "Weigh" is only called once).
	* Some calculations can be performed in parallel to avoid waiting for specific steps to finish.
3. **Overloaded system resource utilization**:
	* The frequency of "Load to Vehicle" and "Place in Stock" indicates high demand periods (3x events per minute or more). While these tasks are important, it's possible that the system can handle them without significant performance degradation.
4. **Inefficient data storage and retrieval**:
	* The large amount of repeated data processing might result from a database with low indexes or inefficient storage mechanisms.
	* Data is being loaded multiple times with minor modifications, which could lead to inconsistencies or timeouts.
	* Consider adding indexing on frequently accessed data to improve query performance and reduce load times.

To address these issues:

1. **Process data in batches**: Divide the dataset into smaller chunks to improve processing efficiency and parallelize tasks when possible.
2. **Use indexes or caching**: Implement database indexing, caching strategies (e.g., Redis), or process caching to reduce the need for frequent table scans or data lookups.
3. **Optimize database storage**: Regularly optimize database structures and consider using NoSQL databases with efficient query capabilities.
4. **Implement load balancing and parallel processing**: Ensure each task is executed concurrently where possible, using multi-threading or multiprocessors when feasible.

By addressing these aspects, the system should experience improved performance as it becomes able to handle increased loads more efficiently.
