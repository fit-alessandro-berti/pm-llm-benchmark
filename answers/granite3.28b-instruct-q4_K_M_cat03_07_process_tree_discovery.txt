Here's a suggested Process Tree structure based on the given event log:

```
+ ( 
  'Receive Application' (RA),
  -> ( 
    'Validate Form' (VF),
    * ( 
      X ( 
        'Request Missing Info' (RMI),
        'Validate Form' (VF) 
      ),
      'Assess Eligibility' (AE) 
    ) 
  ),
  -> ( 
    'Approval Decision' (AD),
    + ( 
      'Send Confirmation' (SC),
      'Archive Case' (AC) 
    ) 
  )
)
```

This process tree captures the main sequence of activities, which includes:

1. Receiving an application (`RA`).
2. Validating the form (`VF`), which may be repeated if `Request Missing Info` (`RMI`) is executed, followed by another validation (`VF`). This is modeled using a loop (`*`).
3. Assessing eligibility (`AE`).
4. An exclusive choice between `Approval Decision` (`AD`) and the subsequent activities (in parallel). 

The parallel branch includes:
- Making an approval decision (`AD`),
- Sending confirmation (`SC`), and
- Archiving the case (`AC`).

This structure ensures that:

- The validation process can loop back if more information is needed.
- All main steps of the business process are represented.
- The choice between the approval process and archival is captured.
