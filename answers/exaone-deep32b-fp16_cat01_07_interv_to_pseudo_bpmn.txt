Okay, let me start by reading through all the interview excerpts carefully to understand the process steps and the different roles involved. The goal is to create a BPMN-like textual model based on the information provided. 

First, the main process seems to be the invoice approval process. Let me note down the key activities and the flow as described by each interviewee.

Starting with Mary, the Accounts Payable Clerk. She mentions the first step is checking if the invoice has a valid PO number. If not, it's sent back to the supplier. If it does have a PO, it's logged into the accounting system. Then it goes to the purchasing department for confirmation of receipt. After that, matching line items with the PO. If discrepancies exist, they contact purchasing, and if unresolved, escalate to supervisor. Once resolved, it goes to the manager for approval, then scheduling payment.

Dan, the Purchasing Officer, says when he gets the invoice, he checks details against the PO. If discrepancies, contact supplier or have AP hold it. If PO number missing, tell Mary to get it. After confirmation, it moves to the manager. 

Carlos, the manager, approves after everything matches and Purchasing confirms. His approval is the last step before payment scheduling.

Rita, the supervisor, handles exceptions when Mary can't resolve issues, so she steps in, coordinates, and then the invoice goes back to the normal flow once fixed.

Karen from Supplier Relations gets involved when there are issues with suppliers, like missing POs or discrepancies, to communicate with them.

Now, I need to map the sequence. Let's outline the steps in order:

1. Invoice Receipt (Email from supplier)
   - Check PO number (Mary)
     - If no PO: send back to supplier, then maybe resubmitted?
     - If PO exists: log into system.

2. Then send to Purchasing (Dan) for confirmation of receipt. Wait, but Mary says after logging, she forwards to purchasing to confirm receipt. So after logging, purchasing checks if goods were received. Then matching line items. 

Wait, the flow from Mary: after logging, forward to purchasing to confirm receipt. Then match invoice line items with PO. If discrepancies, contact purchasing. If unresolved, escalate to supervisor. Then manager approval.

Dan's part: when he gets the invoice from AP, he checks details. So maybe after AP logs it, they send to purchasing for their check. So the sequence is:

Start with Invoice Arrival  Mary checks PO  if valid, log  send to Purchasing (Dan) for receipt confirmation  then match items. 

Wait, but Mary's description says after logging, she forwards to purchasing to confirm receipt. Then after confirmation, she matches the invoice line items against the PO. So the steps after logging are:

- Purchasing confirms receipt (Dan's step)
- Then Mary matches line items with PO. If discrepancies, contact purchasing. If can't resolve, escalate to Rita.

Hmm, so the flow between Mary and Dan might be a bit intertwined here. Let me parse that again.

Mary's process:

1. Invoice arrives  check PO. If no PO  send back to supplier. If yes, log into system.

2. Then forward to purchasing to confirm receipt (so purchasing's role here is to confirm that the goods/services were actually received). 

3. Once purchasing confirms receipt, Mary then matches invoice line items to PO. 

If during this matching there's a discrepancy (like pricing or items missing), she contacts purchasing. If they can't resolve, she escalates to supervisor (Rita). 

Once resolved, then send to manager for approval. Manager's approval then leads to payment scheduling.

Dan's perspective: when he gets the invoice from AP (after Mary logged it?), he checks the details against PO. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me see:

Mary sends the invoice to purchasing (Dan) after logging and after purchasing confirms receipt? Or does Dan check the details before the receipt confirmation?

Wait, Mary says after logging, she forwards to purchasing to confirm receipt. So Dan's step of checking the invoice details (quantities, prices) might come after that confirmation? Or is that part of his own process?

Looking at Dan's interview: he says when the invoice hits his inbox (from AP), he checks details against PO. So perhaps after Mary logs it and forwards to purchasing (Dan), Dan then does his check. Wait, but Mary's steps after logging are to send to purchasing for receipt confirmation. So maybe the flow is:

After logging, purchasing (Dan) first confirms receipt (whether the goods were received as per the PO), then Dan checks the invoice details (prices, etc.)? Or is the receipt confirmation separate from the invoice details check?

Hmm, there might be some ambiguity here. Let me try to reconcile the two accounts.

Mary says after logging, she sends to purchasing to confirm receipt. Then she matches the invoice line items. Dan, when he gets the invoice, checks the details against the PO. So perhaps the receipt confirmation is about whether the goods were actually received (maybe a separate step from checking the invoice's accuracy). 

Alternatively, maybe the receipt confirmation is part of Dan's process. Let me see:

Mary's flow:

- After logging, forward to purchasing (Dan) to confirm receipt. So Dan's first task is to confirm that the goods were received. Once that's done, Mary proceeds to match the invoice items. But Dan also, in his own process, checks the invoice details against the PO. So perhaps after the receipt confirmation, Dan does his detailed check, and if there are discrepancies, he might contact the supplier or have AP hold it. 

Wait, this is a bit conflicting. Let me parse Dan's interview again:

Dan says when he gets the invoice from AP, he checks details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) against the PO. If discrepancies, contact supplier or have AP hold it. If PO number missing, tell Mary to get it. 

So perhaps the flow is:

After Mary logs the invoice (with PO), she sends it to Dan (Purchasing) for his checks. Dan then checks the details. If PO number was missing, he tells Mary to fix it first. Once PO is confirmed, he checks the details. If discrepancies, then he might involve the supplier or have AP hold. 

But Mary's description says that after logging, she sends to purchasing to confirm receipt (maybe that's a separate step from Dan's detailed check). Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe "confirm receipt" is part of Dan's process. Let me try to reconcile both:

Mary's steps:

1. Invoice arrives  check PO. If no PO  send back. If yes, log into system.

2. Then forward to Purchasing (Dan) for confirmation (which includes checking receipt and details? Or just receipt?)

Dan's role is to check the invoice details against the PO. So perhaps the "confirm receipt" is part of that check. So when Mary sends to Dan, he first confirms that the goods were received (maybe by checking receiving reports?), then checks the invoice details. 

Alternatively, maybe "confirm receipt" is a separate step. Let me see the exact wording from Mary:

"After logging it, I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received."

Ah, so the purpose of sending to purchasing is specifically to confirm that the goods were received. Then, after that confirmation, Mary proceeds to match the invoice line items with the PO. 

So the steps after logging are:

- Purchasing confirms receipt (Dan's role here is to confirm that the goods were received as per the PO). 

Then Mary does the line item matching. 

But Dan's own process, when he gets the invoice, involves checking the details (prices, etc.) which might be a separate check. 

This is a bit conflicting. Let me try to structure this step by step.

Possible flow:

1. Invoice received (email)  Mary checks for PO number.

   - If no PO  send back to supplier. Then maybe the process restarts once the supplier provides PO? Or that's an exception?

   - If PO exists  log into system.

2. After logging, Mary sends to Purchasing (Dan) to confirm receipt (i.e., that the goods/services were actually received as per the PO). 

   - Dan's role here is to confirm receipt. If he can't confirm (e.g., goods not received yet?), then maybe the process is blocked here. But according to the interviews, maybe that's not mentioned. Assuming that confirmation is straightforward.

3. Once receipt is confirmed, Mary proceeds to match invoice line items with PO. 

   - If discrepancies (e.g., incorrect price, missing items), she contacts Purchasing (Dan) for clarification. 

   - If Dan can't resolve, she escalates to Rita (supervisor). 

4. Once resolved, the invoice is sent to the manager (Carlos) for approval. 

   - Manager's approval is triggered after all checks (receipt confirmed, line items matched). 

   - If manager rejects, it goes back to fix the issue. 

5. After approval, scheduled for payment. 

But Dan's own process mentions that when he gets the invoice, he checks the details against the PO. So perhaps the line item matching is part of Dan's task? That's conflicting with Mary's description. 

Alternatively, maybe Mary's "matching line items" is part of her process after receiving confirmation from Dan. But Dan's check is a separate step. 

Hmm. Let me see Dan's exact words again:

Dan says: "When the invoice hits my inbox from Accounts Payable, my job is to check if the invoice details line up with what we ordered. I open up the PO and compare quantities, prices, and any delivery charges. If something’s off... we either contact the supplier directly or ask AP to hold the invoice... If everything is correct, I send a confirmation email back to AP."

Ah, so Dan's process is that when he receives the invoice from AP, he checks the details (quantities, prices, etc.) against the PO. So perhaps the flow is:

After Mary logs the invoice into the system, she sends it to Dan (Purchasing) for his detailed check. 

Wait, but Mary said she sends it to purchasing to confirm receipt. Maybe "confirm receipt" is part of Dan's check. Or perhaps "confirm receipt" is a separate step. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion between "confirm receipt of goods" and "confirm that the invoice details match the PO". 

Let me try to parse Mary's steps again:

Mary's steps after logging:

- Forward to purchasing to confirm that the goods were actually received. 

So that's about the delivery, not the invoice details. Then, after that confirmation, she matches the invoice line items with the PO. 

Dan's steps when he gets the invoice:

He checks the invoice details (prices, quantities) against the PO. So perhaps the "confirm receipt" is a separate step from the invoice detail check. 

This suggests that there are two checks here: one for whether the goods were received (maybe via a receiving report), and another for the invoice's accuracy. 

This might mean that after Mary logs the invoice, she sends it to Purchasing for two purposes: first to confirm receipt (Dan checks if goods arrived), and then Dan also does his own check of the invoice details. 

Alternatively, maybe the "confirm receipt" is part of the system's workflow. For example, the system might automatically check if the receipt is recorded, but Dan has to manually confirm. 

This is a bit ambiguous. To resolve this, perhaps the process has two decision points here. Let me try to structure it step by step, noting possible ambiguities.

Starting over:

1. Invoice arrives (email)  Mary checks for PO number.

   - If no PO  send back to supplier. (This is an exception path; perhaps the invoice is returned, and the process restarts once the supplier provides a PO? Or maybe the process can't proceed until then, so that's a blocking point. The transcripts don't mention what happens next here, so maybe we need to note that as an exception.)

   - If PO exists  log into system.

2. After logging, Mary sends the invoice to Purchasing (Dan) for two things: 

   a. Confirm that the goods/services were actually received (maybe by checking a receiving report or system entry). 

   b. Dan also checks the invoice details (quantities, prices) against the PO. 

Wait, but according to Dan's interview, when he gets the invoice, he does the detail check. So perhaps the "confirm receipt" is part of that process. Maybe the receipt confirmation is implied by the fact that the PO was issued and the goods were supposed to be received by the time the invoice comes in. Alternatively, maybe the receipt is confirmed automatically via another system. 

Alternatively, perhaps the "confirm receipt" is a step that Dan does as part of his invoice check. For example, he checks both that the goods were received (maybe via a separate system) and that the invoice matches the PO. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to follow Mary's description, as she is the one describing the flow. She says after logging, she sends to purchasing to confirm receipt, then proceeds to match line items. 

So the steps after logging would be:

- Step 2a: Send to Purchasing (Dan) to confirm receipt. 

   - If receipt is not confirmed (e.g., goods not received?), then maybe the process is blocked here. But the interviews don't mention this, so perhaps it's assumed that receipt is confirmed. 

- Then, Mary proceeds to match line items with PO. 

   - If discrepancies found here, she contacts Purchasing (Dan) for clarification. 

   - If unresolved, escalate to Rita (supervisor). 

Once resolved, then send to manager for approval. 

But Dan's own process says that when he gets the invoice, he checks the details. So perhaps the line item matching is part of Dan's task. 

Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me try to reconcile both perspectives. 

Mary's process after logging:

- Send to Purchasing to confirm receipt  then she does the line item matching. 

Dan's process when he gets the invoice:

- He checks the invoice details against the PO. 

Therefore, perhaps the line item matching is Dan's responsibility. So Mary sends the invoice to Dan for two purposes: confirm receipt and check details. 

Alternatively, maybe the "confirm receipt" is a separate step from the detail check. 

Alternatively, maybe the "confirm receipt" is a formality that's automatically handled, and Dan's main job is the detail check. 

Given that the problem says to note ambiguities, perhaps we can structure it as follows:

After Mary logs the invoice, she sends it to Dan (Purchasing) for processing. 

Dan then performs two checks:

1. Confirm that the goods were received (maybe via a system check or his own confirmation). 

2. Check the invoice details against the PO. 

If either check fails, he may need to contact the supplier or have AP hold the invoice. 

Alternatively, perhaps the receipt confirmation is part of the system's workflow, so Dan only handles the detail check. 

Alternatively, maybe the "confirm receipt" is a separate step that Dan does first. 

This is a bit unclear, but to proceed, I'll structure based on Mary's description, since she's the first to outline the flow. 

So proceeding with Mary's steps:

1. Invoice arrives  check PO. 

   - If no PO  send back to supplier. (This is an exception path. The process would need to restart once the supplier provides a PO, but the transcripts don't specify, so we can note this as an exception.)

   - If PO exists  log into system.

2. Send to Purchasing (Dan) to confirm receipt. 

   - Assuming confirmation is successful, proceed. If not, perhaps the invoice is held? But since the interviews don't mention that, maybe we can assume it proceeds.

3. Mary then matches invoice line items with PO. 

   - If discrepancies  contact Dan. 

   - If Dan can't resolve  escalate to Rita. 

4. Once resolved, send to manager for approval. 

   - Manager's approval is automatic if all good, else may reject. 

5. After approval, payment is scheduled. 

Now, considering Dan's perspective: when he gets the invoice, he checks the details. So perhaps the line item matching is part of his task. Therefore, maybe after Mary sends to Dan for receipt confirmation, Dan does the detail check. 

Alternatively, maybe the receipt confirmation and detail check are separate steps. Let me try to outline the flow with possible gateways:

Start  Invoice Received (Email)  

[Activity: Check PO Number by Mary]

- If PO missing  Send Back to Supplier (Exception Path: "In some cases, after Task B..." but need to see where this fits). 

Assuming Task B is after PO check, so:

If PO present  

[Activity: Log into Accounting System by Mary]

Then:

[Activity: Send to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation (Dan)]

Assuming receipt confirmed  

[Activity: Match Invoice Line Items with PO (Mary)]

At this point, discrepancies may occur:

- If discrepancies  

   [Decision: Can Dan resolve?]

   - Yes  proceed to Manager Approval

   - No  Escalate to Rita (Supervisor)

Wait, but according to Mary's account, if discrepancies exist, she contacts purchasing (Dan). If unresolved, she escalates. So the decision is whether Dan can resolve it. 

So after the line item matching:

If discrepancies  contact Dan. 

If Dan resolves  proceed to manager. 

If not resolved  escalate to Rita. 

Once Rita resolves, then back to matching step? Or back to manager approval?

Alternatively, after escalation, once Rita coordinates and resolves, the process continues to manager approval. 

Then, after manager approval, payment is scheduled. 

Now, the manager's approval is triggered after all checks (receipt confirmed and line items matched). 

Dan's own check (from his interview) might be part of the line item matching. 

Additionally, Dan mentions that if the PO number is missing, he tells Mary to get it. But Mary already checked for PO presence initially. So perhaps in some cases, even after Mary checks, the PO might be missing in the system? Or maybe the PO is present but not properly referenced in the invoice? 

Alternatively, maybe when Mary checks the PO number, she might miss something, so Dan could also check again. 

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to structure the main path and note ambiguities where necessary.

Another point: Rita's role comes into play when exceptions can't be resolved by Mary and Dan. So the escalation path is from Mary to Rita. 

Karen's involvement is when there are supplier issues, so perhaps when the discrepancy can't be resolved internally, they involve Karen to talk to the supplier. 

Now, compiling all this into a textual BPMN-like model:

Start with the initial step of receiving the invoice. 

Activities:

1. Receive Invoice (Email)
2. Check PO Number (Mary)
   - If no PO  Send Back to Supplier (Exception: "In some cases, after Task B (PO check), participants may send back to supplier if PO missing. The process may restart once PO is provided, but this path isn't detailed in interviews.")
3. Log into Accounting System (Mary)
4. Send to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation (Dan)
   - Assuming confirmation is successful here. If not, perhaps another exception, but not mentioned.
5. Match Invoice Line Items with PO (Mary)
   - If discrepancies  Contact Purchasing (Dan) for clarification
     - If resolved  Proceed to Manager Approval
     - If unresolved  Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)
6. Manager Approval (Carlos)
   - If approved  Schedule Payment
   - If rejected  Escalate (maybe back to Mary/Dan for correction)
7. Schedule Payment (Mary)

Additionally, when discrepancies occur during matching, Dan might need to contact the supplier (as per his interview: "contact the supplier directly or ask AP to hold the invoice"). So perhaps after Mary contacts Dan, Dan can decide to involve the supplier, which would be another gateway. 

Also, Karen is involved when supplier contact is needed. So when Dan contacts the supplier, Karen might be looped in. 

Another point: When the PO is missing, Mary sends it back to the supplier. The supplier might then resend with PO, which would restart the process. But since the interviews don't detail that, we can note it as an exception path. 

Now, considering all these, the textual model should outline the main flow with decision points and roles. Let's structure it step by step, noting ambiguities where necessary.

Possible structure:

Process Flow:

1. **Receive Invoice (Email)**  
   - **Actor:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Trigger:** Invoice email received.  

2. **Check PO Number Validity**  
   - **Activity:** Mary verifies if the invoice includes a valid PO number.  
   - **Decision Gateway 1:**  
     - **Yes (PO present):** Proceed to log into system.  
     - **No (PO missing):**  
       - **Exception Path:** Send invoice back to supplier for PO details.  
       - *Note:* The process may restart once the supplier provides a PO, but details beyond this are unclear.  

3. **Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
   - **Activity:** Mary enters invoice details into the system.  

4. **Send to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation**  
   - **Actor:** Mary forwards the invoice to Purchasing Department (Dan).  
   - **Purpose:** Confirm that goods/services were received as per PO.  
   - *Assumption:* Confirmation is successful unless otherwise noted.  

5. **Match Invoice Line Items with PO**  
   - **Activity:** Mary compares invoice items against the PO.  
   - **Decision Gateway 2:**  
     - **No discrepancies:** Proceed to Manager Approval.  
     - **Discrepancies found:**  
       - **Activity:** Contact Purchasing (Dan) for clarification.  
       - **Sub-Decision:**  
         - If Dan resolves (e.g., supplier confirms correction), proceed.  
         - If unresolved, **Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)**.  

6. **Manager Approval Request**  
   - **Trigger:** After discrepancies resolved and receipt confirmed.  
   - **Actor:** System sends automatic email to Department Manager (Carlos).  
   - **Decision Gateway 3:**  
     - **Approved:** Proceed to Schedule Payment.  
     - **Rejected:** Escalate for further investigation (e.g., back to Mary/Dan).  

7. **Schedule Payment**  
   - **Activity:** Mary adds approved invoice to payment run.  

**Alternative Paths/Exceptions:**  
- **PO Missing Exception Path:** As noted, returns to supplier.  
- **Unresolved Discrepancies:** Escalate to Rita, who coordinates with suppliers (via Karen) or departments.  
- **Manager Rejection:** Triggers rework, possibly involving Mary and Dan to correct the invoice.  

**Roles Involved:**  
- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
- Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
- Department Manager (Carlos)  
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)  
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) [for supplier communication]  

**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**  
- Invoice (email, document)  
- Purchase Order (PO)  
- Receipt confirmation (document/system entry)  
- System notifications (for manager approval)  

**Notes on Ambiguities:**  
- The exact process after a PO is missing isn't detailed; the return to supplier may require resubmission.  
- The interaction between receipt confirmation and invoice detail checks (Dan's role) could have overlapping steps; the model assumes receipt confirmation is a separate step before line item matching.  
- Karen's involvement is implied when supplier contact is needed during discrepancies but isn't explicitly part of the main flow until escalation.  

I need to ensure that the textual BPMN includes all these elements clearly. Let me structure it in a more formal way, using BPMN-like elements like tasks, gateways, and flows, while noting uncertainties.

**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Workflow**

---

### **Process Flow Overview**  
**Objective:** Approval of invoices through alignment with Purchase Orders (POs) and stakeholder validations.  

---

#### **1. Invoice Receipt & Initial Validation**  
- **Activity:** *Receive Invoice Email*  
  - **Actor:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
  - **Trigger:** Supplier email invoice to AP inbox.  

- **Activity:** *Check PO Number Validity*  
  - **Decision Gateway 1 (XOR):**  
    - **Yes (PO present):** Proceed to **Log Invoice**.  
    - **No (PO missing):**  
      - **Exception Path:** *Send Invoice Back to Supplier*  
        - **Actor:** Mary requests PO details via email.  
        - *Note:* Process restarts upon supplier resubmission (details unspecified in interviews).  

---

#### **2. System Logging & Handoff to Purchasing**  
- **Activity:** *Log Invoice into Accounting System*  
  - **Actor:** Mary enters invoice into ERP/accounting software.  

- **Activity:** *Forward to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation*  
  - **Actor:** Mary sends invoice to Purchasing Officer (Dan).  
  - **Purpose:** Verify goods/services receipt aligns with PO (e.g., matching delivery receipts).  
  - *Assumption:* Confirmation is typically successful; exceptions (e.g., missing receipts) not detailed.  

---

#### **3. Invoice Detail Matching & Resolution**  
- **Activity:** *Match Invoice Line Items with PO*  
  - **Decision Gateway 2 (XOR):**  
    - **No discrepancies:** Proceed to **Manager Approval**.  
    - **Discrepancies (e.g., pricing, missing items):**  
      - **Activity:** *Contact Purchasing for Clarification*  
        - **Actor:** Mary coordinates with Dan.  
        - **Sub-Decision:**  
          - **Resolved internally (Dan confirms correction):** Proceed.  
          - **Unresolved:** *Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)*  
              - **Actor:** Rita intervenes; may involve Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) to liaise with supplier.  

---

#### **4. Manager Approval**  
- **Activity:** *Trigger Manager Approval Request*  
  - **Trigger:** System auto-sends notification to Department Manager (Carlos).  
  - **Decision Gateway 3 (XOR):**  
    - **Approved:** Proceed to **Schedule Payment**.  
    - **Rejected (e.g., budget mismatch):**  
      - **Reroute to Purchasing/AP for correction** (details unspecified; noted as potential rework loop).  

---

#### **5. Payment Execution**  
- **Activity:** *Schedule Payment*  
  - **Actor:** Mary adds approved invoice to payment batch.  
  - **Output:** Payment processed in next run.  

---

### **Key Roles & Artifacts**  
- **Roles:**  
  - **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Handles initial checks, logging, and escalation.  
  - **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Validates invoice details vs. PO; liaises with suppliers.  
  - **Department Manager (Carlos):** Final approver after validations.  
  - **AP Supervisor (Rita):** Resolves complex discrepancies (e.g., missing POs, supplier disputes).  
  - **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Supports supplier communication during disputes.  

- **Artifacts:**  
  - Invoice (email/document).  
  - Purchase Order (PO) reference.  
  - Receipt confirmation (system/document).  
  - System notifications (e.g., manager approval requests).  

---

### **Exception Paths & Ambiguities**  
1. **PO Missing:**  
   - Process halts until supplier provides PO. Restart logic not detailed; noted as an edge case.  

2. **Unresolved Discrepancies:**  
   - Escalation to Rita may involve Karen for supplier negotiation (implied but not explicit in flow).  

3. **Manager Rejection:**  
   - Rework loop back to AP/Purchasing; specifics (e.g., who revises the invoice) unspecified.  

4. **Receipt Confirmation vs. Detail Check Ambiguity:**  
   - Interviews conflate "receipt confirmation" (Dan’s role) and invoice-PO matching (Mary’s task). Assumed sequential here but may overlap in practice.  

---

### **Notes for BPMN Conversion**  
- **Gateways:** Use XOR (exclusive OR) for decision points (e.g., PO presence, discrepancies).  
- **Call Activities:** Integrate Karen’s supplier liaison as a sub-process during escalations.  
- **Repetition:** The "PO missing" path should loop back to the start with a resumed flow after PO attachment.  

This model balances the interviews’ details while flagging areas where interviews conflict or omit specifics.
