To solve this, we need to analyze the event log based on the given normative constraints and desiderata.

#### Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules):
The required sequence is as follows:
1. Application Received
2. Credit Check
3. Risk Assessment
4. Loan Decision (either approved or rejected)
5. Inform Applicant
6. [If Loan Decision is Approved, then Finalize Documentation should be done]  Close Case.
7. [If Loan Decision is Rejected, do not Finalize Documentation; instead, directly proceed to Close Case.]

#### Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict):
1. Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours after receiving the loan application.
2. The applicant should be informed within 48 hours of the loan decision.
3. A Follow-up Call should ideally be made sometime before closing the case.
    
#### Case 1 Analysis:
1. **Timestamps and Activities for Case 1:**
   - 2024-01-10 09:00: Application Received
   - 2024-01-10 09:30: Credit Check (30 minutes after Application Received)
   - 2024-01-10 10:00: Risk Assessment (30 minutes after Credit Check)
   - 2024-01-10 11:00: Loan Decision (Approved) (1 hour after Risk Assessment)
   - 2024-01-10 13:00: Inform Applicant (2 hours after Loan Decision)
   - 2024-01-10 13:30: Finalize Documentation (30 minutes after Inform Applicant)
   - 2024-01-10 14:00: Close Case (30 minutes after Finalize Documentation)

**Normative Process Behavior for Case 1:**
   - The order follows the required sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
   - Since the loan was approved, Finalize Documentation should occur before Close Case, which it does here.

**Conclusion for Case 1 Normative Rules:**
   - **No violations of normative rules.**

**Desiderata for Case 1:**
   - Credit Check was done within 24 hours of receiving the application (30 minutes after).
   - The applicant was informed within 48 hours of the loan decision (2 hours after).
   - However, there was no Follow-up Call mentioned, which is a desideratum violation.

**Conclusion for Case 1 Desiderata:**
   - **Violation of desiderata:** No Follow-up Call was made.

#### Case 2 Analysis:
1. **Timestamps and Activities for Case 2:**
   - 2024-01-11 08:00: Application Received
   - 2024-01-11 08:20: Risk Assessment (20 minutes after Application Received, but before Credit Check)
   - 2024-01-11 09:00: Credit Check (40 minutes after Risk Assessment)
   - 2024-01-11 09:30: Loan Decision (Rejected) (30 minutes after Credit Check)
   - 2024-01-11 10:00: Finalize Documentation (30 minutes after Loan Decision)
   - 2024-01-11 10:30: Close Case (30 minutes after Finalize Documentation)

**Normative Process Behavior for Case 2:**
   - The order here is: Application Received  Risk Assessment  Credit Check  Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
   - The first issue here is that a Risk Assessment was done before Credit Check, which violates the normative constraint that requires Credit Check to occur before Risk Assessment.
   - Another issue here is that after the Loan Decision was "Rejected," the process should not include Finalize Documentation. However, Case 2 still has a "Finalize Documentation" step after a rejection.

**Conclusion for Case 2 Normative Rules:**
   - **Violations of normative rules:**
      1. Risk Assessment was done before Credit Check.
      2. Finalize Documentation was done after a Loan Decision (Rejected).

**Desiderata for Case 2:**
   - Credit Check was done within 24 hours (1 hour after Application Received).
   - The applicant was not explicitly "Informed" here. However, the question context makes it clear that "Inform Applicant" should always follow "Loan Decision." However, "Inform Applicant" is missing here which seems like a normative rule violation rather than a desideratum.
   - No Follow-up Call was made here either.

**Conclusion for Case 2 Desiderata:**
   - **Violation of desiderata:** No Follow-up Call was made.

#### Case 3 Analysis:
1. **Timestamps and Activities for Case 3:**
   - 2024-01-12 09:00: Application Received
   - 2024-01-14 10:00: Credit Check (2 days and 1 hour after Application Received, which is more than 24 hours later)
   - 2024-01-14 11:00: Risk Assessment (1 hour after Credit Check)
   - 2024-01-14 12:00: Loan Decision (Approved) (1 hour after Risk Assessment)
   - 2024-01-16 15:00: Inform Applicant (2 days and 3 hours after Loan Decision, which is more than 48 hours later)
   - 2024-01-17 09:00: Finalize Documentation (18 hours after Inform Applicant)
   - 2024-01-17 10:00: Close Case (1 hour after Finalize Documentation)

**Normative Process Behavior for Case 3:**
   - The order here is: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
   - The order follows the required sequence for an approved loan: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.

**Conclusion for Case 3 Normative Rules:**
   - **No violations of normative rules.**

**Desiderata for Case 3:**
   - Credit Check was done more than 24 hours after receiving the application (49 hours later).
   - The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision (51 hours later).
   - No Follow-up Call was made here either.

**Conclusion for Case 3 Desiderata:**
   - **Violations of desiderata:**
      1. Credit Check was done 49 hours after Application Received (recommended within 24 hours).
      2. Inform Applicant was done 51 hours after Loan Decision (recommended within 48 hours).
      3. No Follow-up Call was made.

#### Summary:

1. **Normative Rule Violations:**
   - **Case 1:** No normative rule violations.
   - **Case 2:** Violations:
      1. Risk Assessment was done before Credit Check.
      2. Finalize Documentation was done after a Loan Decision (Rejected).
   - **Case 3:** No normative rule violations.

2. **Desiderata Violations:**
   - **Case 1:** No Follow-up Call was made.
   - **Case 2:**
      1. No Follow-up Call was made.
      2. The "Inform Applicant" activity seems to be missing entirely, which seems more like a normative rule violation.
   - **Case 3:**
      1. Credit Check was done later than 24 hours after Application Received.
      2. Inform Applicant was done later than 48 hours after Loan Decision.
      3. No Follow-up Call was made.

3. **Suggestions or Interpretations:**
   - For Case 2, the process seems severely out of order (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and includes an unnecessary Finalize Documentation step after a rejection. This case should be investigated for potential process handling errors.
   - For Case 3, while it did not violate any normative rules, the delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant should be reviewed for process efficiency improvements. 

This reasoning process helps us identify which parts of the event log adhere to the given normative behavior and desiderata.
