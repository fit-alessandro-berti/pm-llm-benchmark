This visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the process of dispatching goods. It outlines the steps involved in preparing and shipping a package. Here's an explanation of the key steps and flow shown in the diagram:

1. **Ship goods**: The process begins with shipping goods, likely from a warehouse or dispatch area.
   
2. **Clarify shipment method**: The next step involves determining how the goods will be shipped, which could include choosing between different shipping methods.

3. **Check if insurance is required**: The system checks whether insurance is needed for the shipment, based on the customer or the shipment's specifics. If insurance is necessary, it moves to the next step; if not, it skips to writing the package label.

4. **Insure parcel**: If insurance is required, the parcel is insured.

5. **Write package label**: Regardless of the insurance requirement, the next task is to prepare the package label.

6. **Get 3 offers from logistic companies**: The system retrieves three offers from different logistics companies for shipping options.

7. **Select logistic company and place order**: After reviewing the offers, the company selects a logistics provider and places the shipment order.

8. **Package goods**: After selecting the logistics company, the goods are packaged.

9. **48 hours delay**: The process includes a potential 48-hour delay for packaging or shipment preparation, during which customers are notified about any delays.

10. **Notify customer about delay**: If the delay is longer than expected, the customer is notified of the delay.

11. **Fill out shipment paperwork**: Once everything is prepared, the required paperwork for shipment is filled out.

12. **Move package to pickup area**: The packaged goods are moved to the pickup area for shipment.

13. **Shipment prepared**: The process ends when the shipment is fully prepared for delivery.

The diagram also shows the roles or departments responsible for different tasks. It is organized across three lanes: 
- **Logistics**: In charge of shipment methods and ensuring everything is packed and ready for dispatch.
- **Warehouse**: Handles the packaging and shipping of goods.
- **Secretary/Computer Operator**: Manages the order details, communication, and paperwork.

The diagram uses BPMN symbols such as rectangles for tasks, diamonds for decision points (e.g., insurance required), and arrows to indicate the flow of the process.
