# Bias Analysis: Group A vs Group B Event Logs

## Executive Summary

**Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits clear systematic bias** through the application of score adjustments that systematically favor applicants with community group affiliations. This creates disparate treatment that correlates with the LocalResident attribute.

---

## Detailed Bias Analysis

### 1. **Score Adjustment Disparity**

| Metric | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Cases with Score Adjustments | 0/3 (0%) | 2/3 (67%) |
| Average Score Adjustment | 0 points | +6.67 points |
| Adjustment Type | None applied | Community Boost (+10) |

**Manifestation of Bias:**
- Group A: No applicants receive score adjustments regardless of score or outcome
- Group B: Applicants with community group affiliations (U001, U003) receive +10 point boosts; those without (U002) receive no adjustment

### 2. **Approval Rate Analysis**

| Metric | Group A | Group B |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Approval Rate | 2/3 (67%) | 2/3 (67%) |
| **Critical Difference** | **Based solely on preliminary scores** | **Score manipulation via adjustments** |

**The Hidden Bias:**
While overall approval rates appear similar, the *mechanism* reveals discrimination:

- **P001 & P003 (Approved):** Scores 720 & 740  Approved with NO adjustments
- **U001 (Approved):** Score 720  Adjusted to 730  Approved
- **U003 (Approved):** Score 695  Adjusted to 705  Approved 

**U003 would have been rejected at 695 but was rescued by the +10 adjustment.**

### 3. **Borderline Case Analysis**

The most damning evidence appears in the borderline cases:

| Case | Preliminary Score | Adjustment | Final Score | Decision | Implication |
|------|------------------|------------|------------|----------|------------|
| U003 | 695 | +10 | 705 | Approved | Community affiliation *changed outcome* |
| P002 | 710 | 0 | 710 | Rejected | Non-member rejected at higher score |

**Finding:** An applicant with a 695 score + community affiliation was approved, while an applicant with a 710 score without such affiliation was rejected. This represents a **15-point swing in decision outcomes** based solely on group membership.

## How Bias Manifests Through the Identified Attributes

### **LocalResident Attribute**
- Group A: All FALSE (non-local residents)
- Group B: All TRUE (local residents)

**Correlation Issue:** LocalResident status correlates perfectly with bias, though it's not the direct cause—it's a *proxy* for CommunityGroup eligibility.

### **CommunityGroup Attribute**
- **Group A:** None for all applicants (no opportunity for boost)
- **Group B:** 2 of 3 have affiliations; these receive boosts

**The Bias Mechanism:**
1. Only local residents can access community group status
2. Only community group members receive score adjustments
3. Score adjustments materially impact approval decisions
4. Therefore: Local residents with community ties receive preferential treatment

### **ScoreAdjustment Column**
This is where bias is encoded:

```
Group A: [0, 0, 0] - No one gets adjustment
Group B: [+10, 0, +10] - Community members get +10 boost
```

This adjustment is **conditional on a protected/quasi-protected characteristic** (community membership access based on local residency).

## Systemic Impact

### Disparate Treatment
- **U001:** 720 baseline  730 adjusted = Approved
- **P001:** 720 baseline  720 (no adjustment) = Approved
- **U003:** 695 baseline  705 adjusted = Approved
- **P002:** 710 baseline  710 (no adjustment) = Rejected

**Conclusion:** Identical or lower baseline scores receive approval when community affiliation is present.

### Disparate Impact
Even if the adjustment policy were applied equally, it creates disparate impact:
- Non-local residents cannot access community boost (0% eligible)
- Local residents can access community boost (67% eligible in Group B)
- This creates a **structural disadvantage** for non-local applicants

## Evidence of Systematic Bias (Not Random Error)

1. **Pattern Consistency:** Every case with community affiliation receives +10; every case without receives 0
2. **Outcome Dependency:** The +10 adjustment directly determines approval in U003
3. **No Equivalent Mechanism in Group A:** The absence of any adjustments in Group A shows this is policy-driven, not system error
4. **Logical Implausibility:** Why would community darts club membership boost creditworthiness? This suggests the adjustment serves non-legitimate business purposes

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Remove the community boost adjustment from the scoring engine
2. **Investigation:** Audit all cases processed with this adjustment; review if decisions should be reconsidered
3. **Policy Review:** If community involvement is to be considered, apply it consistently and transparently to all applicants, with documented business justification
4. **Control Implementation:** Implement fairness constraints to flag score adjustments that:
   - Are not uniformly applied
   - Create disparate impact by protected characteristic proxy
   - Cannot be independently validated as business-necessary

---

## Conclusion

**Group B exhibits actionable bias through preferential score adjustments that systematically advantage local residents with community affiliations.** This manifests as disparate treatment (different rules applied) and creates disparate impact (structurally unequal access). Case U003 is the clearest violation: a sub-threshold applicant was approved through adjustment while P002 at a higher score was rejected without any adjustment opportunity.
