Based on the normative process description and the event log provided, I have identified several cases that deviate from the intended process flow. Here's an analysis of each case:

Case 1:
This case follows the normative process correctly. The activities occur in the expected sequence: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, and Close order.

Case 2:
This case violates the normative process. The violation occurs because "Package items" is performed before "Authorize payment". According to the description, payment authorization should occur before packaging the items.

Case 3:
This case contains multiple violations:
1. After "Cancel order", the process continues with "Ship order". The description clearly states that shipping should never occur after cancellation.
2. The presence of both "Authorize payment" and "Cancel order" in the same case is inconsistent with the described process flow. If inventory is insufficient (leading to cancellation), payment should not be authorized.

Case 4:
This case follows the normative process correctly for the scenario where inventory is insufficient. The sequence Receive order, Check inventory, Cancel order, Close order aligns with the described process for this situation.

Case 5:
This case violates the normative process. The violation occurs because "Package items" is missing from the sequence. According to the description, items should be packaged after payment authorization and before shipping.

In summary, Cases 2, 3, and 5 contain violations of the normative process, while Cases 1 and 4 adhere to the described workflow.

These interpretations are based on the given description, resolving ambiguities by adhering closely to the stated principles. However, it's worth noting that real-world processes may sometimes require flexibility that isn't captured in a strict normative description.
