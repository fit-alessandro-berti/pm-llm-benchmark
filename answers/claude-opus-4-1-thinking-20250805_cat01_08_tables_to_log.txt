Based on the provided ERP tables, I'll create a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining. I'll extract events from each table and combine them chronologically.

## Event Log

## Key Assumptions and Notes:

1. **Case ID**: Used `order_id` as the unique case identifier for each process instance.

2. **Activities Identified**:
   - Order Created (from Orders table)
   - Item Picked (from Order Lines table - one event per item)
   - Order Dispatched (from Delivery table)
   - Order Arrived (from Delivery table)
   - Invoice Issued (from Invoice table)
   - Payment Received (from Payments table)

3. **Resource Mapping**: Combined resource IDs with names and roles from the Resources table for better readability.

4. **Incomplete Cases**: Order 1004 shows an incomplete process - items were picked but no delivery, invoice, or payment records exist, suggesting the order may still be in progress.

5. **Multiple Events**: Order 1002 demonstrates a complex case with:
   - Multiple deliveries (split shipment)
   - Multiple invoices
   - Multiple payments

6. **Chronological Order**: All events are ordered by timestamp within each case, maintaining the logical flow of the business process.

7. **Enrichment**: Added relevant attributes like customer type, order priority, item descriptions, invoice amounts, and delivery notes to provide context for process analysis.
