# Comprehensive Queue Mining Analysis for Outpatient Clinic Process Optimization

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis presents a systematic, data-driven methodology to address patient throughput challenges in a multi-specialty outpatient clinic. By applying process mining and queue mining techniques to six months of event log data, we can move beyond anecdotal complaints to precise, quantifiable diagnoses of where, when, and why patients wait—and construct interventions that are grounded in evidence rather than intuition. The approach is structured around five pillars: rigorous queue characterization, multi-dimensional root cause analysis, targeted optimization strategies, honest trade-off assessment, and sustained performance monitoring.

## Section 1: Queue Identification and Characterization

### 1.1 Defining and Computing Waiting Time

In the context of this event log, **waiting time (queue time)** between two consecutive activities is defined as the elapsed duration from the **completion timestamp of one activity** to the **start timestamp of the next activity** for the same patient visit (Case ID). This interval represents pure idle time from the patient's perspective—the period during which the patient has finished one step but has not yet begun the next, typically because a required resource (clinician, room, equipment) is unavailable or because the patient is queued awaiting their turn.

Formally, for patient visit *V* with consecutive activities *A_i* and *A_{i+1}*:

```
WT(A_i  A_{i+1}) = START_timestamp(A_{i+1}) - COMPLETE_timestamp(A_i)
```

**Important definitional nuances:**

- **Negative waiting times** (where the next activity starts before the previous completes) indicate data quality issues or parallel activities that were recorded sequentially. These must be flagged during preprocessing and either corrected or excluded from queue calculations.
- **Zero waiting times** are theoretically possible (immediate handovers) but rare and should be verified against operational reality.
- **Distinction from service time**: Service time (activity duration) = COMPLETE_timestamp - START_timestamp for a single activity. Waiting time and service time are orthogonal dimensions. Total visit duration = (service times) + (waiting times), making waiting time reduction the most impactful lever for visit duration improvement without altering clinical protocols.
- **Activity sequencing**: For each case, activities must be ordered by their start timestamps to establish the correct sequence before computing inter-activity gaps. In cases where a patient visits multiple specialties or undergoes multiple tests, the correct sequential order must be established from the data rather than assumed from a fixed process template.

### 1.2 Data Preparation Pipeline

Before calculating queue metrics, the following preprocessing steps are essential:

**Step 1 — Data Validation:**
- Check for missing start or complete timestamps
- Identify cases where activity durations are negative or implausibly short/long
- Detect duplicate records or data entry errors

**Step 2 — Activity Sequence Construction:**
For each Case ID, sort all activity records by START timestamp. Identify the predecessor-successor pairs (transitions) that represent potential queues. Given the multi-specialty nature of the clinic, not all patients follow the same path. For example:
- *Path A*: Registration  Nurse Assessment  Doctor (Cardiology)  ECG  Check-out
- *Path B*: Registration  Nurse Assessment  Doctor (Orthopedics)  X-Ray  Specialist Review  Check-out
- *Path C*: Registration  Doctor (Follow-up, Dermatology)  Check-out

Each transition in each path represents a distinct queue to be characterized.

**Step 3 — Queue Record Creation:**
Generate a structured dataset where each row represents one patient's experience of one transition:

| Case ID | From Activity | To Activity | Queue Time (minutes) | Patient Type | Urgency | Day of Week | Time of Day | Resource (From) | Resource (To) |
|---------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|

This dataset becomes the foundation for all subsequent queue analysis.

### 1.3 Key Queue Characterization Metrics

For each distinct transition (queue point) identified in the process, the following metrics should be calculated:

**Central Tendency Metrics:**
- **Mean Waiting Time**: Useful for understanding overall resource demand relative to capacity, but sensitive to outliers in healthcare settings
- **Median Waiting Time**: More robust measure of typical patient experience; preferable when distributions are right-skewed (which is common in queuing systems)
- **Mode**: Identifies the most commonly experienced wait duration

**Dispersion and Tail Metrics:**
- **Standard Deviation**: Indicates consistency of the process; high variability is often as problematic as high average waits
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Distance between 25th and 75th percentile; characterizes middle-50% experience
- **90th Percentile Wait Time**: Critical for understanding the experience of the worst-served majority of patients; often more actionable than maximum
- **95th Percentile Wait Time**: Identifies near-worst-case scenarios
- **Maximum Waiting Time**: Flags extreme outlier cases; useful for investigating specific process failures

**Volume and Frequency Metrics:**
- **Total Number of Cases Passing Through This Queue**: Absolute volume; high-volume queues affect more patients even if individual waits are moderate
- **Queue Frequency Rate**: Proportion of all visits that experience this particular transition (relevant because not all patients undergo all activities)
- **Number of Cases Exceeding Threshold**: Count and percentage of cases where wait exceeds a clinically/operationally defined threshold (e.g., >30 minutes, >60 minutes)

**Temporal Pattern Metrics:**
- **Hourly/Daily Volume Distribution**: When during the day or week is the queue longest?
- **Day-of-Week Variation**: Are Mondays systematically worse than Thursdays?
- **Time-of-Day Peak Analysis**: Does the queue build through the morning and dissipate in the afternoon?

**Stratified Metrics:**
All metrics above should be computed stratified by:
- Patient type (New vs. Follow-up vs. Urgent)
- Specialty/department
- Day of week
- Time of day band (Morning: 8-11am, Midday: 11am-1pm, Afternoon: 1-5pm)
- Specific resource assigned to the preceding or succeeding activity

A sample output table might look like:

| Queue Transition | Mean WT (min) | Median WT (min) | P90 WT (min) | Volume (cases) | % > 30min |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Registration  Nurse Assessment | 12.4 | 8.2 | 28.6 | 4,820 | 18.3% |
| Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation | 34.7 | 27.1 | 68.4 | 4,650 | 52.1% |
| Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test | 18.3 | 11.5 | 42.7 | 2,890 | 31.4% |
| Diagnostic Test  Check-out | 6.8 | 4.2 | 15.3 | 2,890 | 4.2% |
| Doctor Consultation  Check-out (no test) | 9.1 | 5.7 | 19.8 | 1,760 | 8.6% |

### 1.4 Identifying the Most Critical Queues

Not all queues deserve equal attention. A structured criticality scoring framework ensures resources are directed toward the highest-impact interventions. I propose a **Composite Criticality Index (CCI)** combining four dimensions:

**Dimension 1 — Magnitude of Wait (Weight: 35%)**
Normalized score based on median and 90th percentile wait times relative to the maximum observed across all queues. Captures severity of the typical and near-worst experience.

**Dimension 2 — Volume Impact (Weight: 30%)**
Number of patient visits affected by this queue multiplied by the mean waiting time gives "total patient waiting hours" attributable to this queue. This dimension ensures that a moderate wait affecting 4,000 patients scores higher than an extreme wait affecting 20 patients.

**Dimension 3 — Dispersion/Unpredictability (Weight: 20%)**
High standard deviation relative to mean (coefficient of variation) indicates an unpredictable process that erodes patient trust even when average waits are acceptable. Patients are disproportionately dissatisfied by uncertainty about how long they will wait.

**Dimension 4 — Differential Impact on Vulnerable Populations (Weight: 15%)**
If a specific queue disproportionately affects urgent patients, elderly patients, or pediatric cases (identifiable through patient attributes in the log), it receives elevated priority due to clinical and ethical considerations.

**Critical Queue Selection Criteria — Justification:**

- **Longest average/median wait**: Directly reflects capacity shortfalls and process inefficiencies
- **Highest volume**: Maximizes the number of patients benefiting from improvement
- **High variability**: Even if mean is acceptable, high variance creates unpredictability that degrades experience
- **Impact on specific patient types**: Urgent patients waiting behind routine cases is clinically unacceptable; new patients having worse experiences than follow-ups may damage long-term patient acquisition

Based on illustrative data above, the **Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation** transition (mean: 34.7 min, 52.1% of patients waiting >30 minutes, 4,650 cases) would likely rank as the highest-priority queue, followed by **Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test**.

## Section 2: Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Framework for Root Cause Investigation

Identifying *where* queues exist is necessary but insufficient. Sustainable improvement requires understanding *why* they exist. Root causes in healthcare queuing systems typically span six categories, which I examine in sequence, explaining the specific process mining analytical techniques used to investigate each.

### 2.2 Root Cause Category 1: Resource Bottlenecks

**Hypothesis**: Certain resources (doctors, nurses, specific equipment, rooms) are consistently overloaded relative to demand, creating queues immediately upstream of them.

**Analysis Approach — Resource Utilization Analysis:**

From the event log, for each resource entity, compute:
```
Utilization Rate = (Total time resource is engaged in activities) / (Total available working time)
```

A resource with utilization >85% is typically considered a bottleneck in service systems—it has insufficient slack to absorb demand variability, causing queues to form even under moderate load.

Additionally, compute **resource availability profiles**: How many simultaneous activities is each resource engaged in at each time interval? For example, if Dr. Smith appears in the event log as simultaneously conducting two consultations (which shouldn't be possible for a single physician), this may indicate resource pooling (multiple physicians of the same type) or data quality issues.

**Specific Indicators of Resource Bottleneck:**
- High utilization rate (>85%) for a specific resource
- Long queue immediately *before* activities requiring that resource
- Wait time strongly correlated with the queue depth for that resource at the time the patient completes the preceding activity
- Minimal queue time *after* activities completed by that resource (the bottleneck doesn't wait for what comes next)

**Example Finding**: If Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation waits are consistently long, and analysis shows that Dr. Smith (Cardiology) has 94% utilization while Dr. Johnson (Internal Medicine) has 71% utilization with shorter upstream queues, this points to a specialty-specific physician capacity shortfall rather than a systemic nursing bottleneck.

**Equipment and Room Bottlenecks:**

For diagnostic areas (ECG machines, X-ray rooms, blood draw stations), compute:
- Equipment utilization rate over time
- Queue time distribution for patients waiting for each piece of equipment
- Whether queue times spike when multiple patients are routed to the same equipment simultaneously (scheduling conflicts)

### 2.3 Root Cause Category 2: Activity Duration Variability

**Hypothesis**: Even with adequate average capacity, high variability in service times means that a longer-than-average service episode depletes the buffer for subsequent patients, creating cascading delays.

**Analysis Approach — Service Time Distribution Analysis:**

For each activity, compute the distribution of service times (COMPLETE - START) from the event log. Key questions:

- Is the distribution approximately normal, log-normal, or heavy-tailed?
- Is variability stratified by patient type? (New patient consultations may be 2-3x longer than follow-ups)
- Is variability stratified by specific resource? (Some physicians may consistently have longer/shorter consultations)
- Are there bimodal distributions suggesting the activity actually encompasses two different types of encounters lumped together?

**Correlation Analysis:**
Compute Pearson or Spearman correlation between:
- Service time of activity A and waiting time before activity B (downstream impact)
- Variability in activity A service times and queue depth at activity B

High positive correlation between consultation duration variability and downstream wait times confirms that service time variability is a primary driver of queuing, even when average utilization appears manageable.

**Variant Analysis for Service Time:**

Using process mining variant analysis, cluster cases by their process path (sequence of activities) and compute service time distributions per variant. This reveals whether certain patient subpopulations (e.g., new patients with complex conditions following a longer path variant) are disproportionately responsible for variability.

### 2.4 Root Cause Category 3: Appointment Scheduling Policies

**Hypothesis**: The clinic's appointment scheduling rules create predictable surge patterns that overwhelm capacity at specific times, despite adequate overall daily capacity.

**Analysis Approach — Arrival Pattern Analysis:**

From the event log, extract the distribution of registration START times (proxy for patient arrival/appointment time) across:
- Hours within the day
- Days of the week
- Weeks/months (seasonal patterns)

**Common problematic scheduling patterns identifiable from event log data:**

1. **Top-of-hour clustering**: Many appointment systems schedule in round-hour slots (9:00, 10:00, 11:00), creating artificial arrival waves. If the data shows sharp spikes in registrations at :00 and :30 marks, this is a scheduling artifact rather than natural patient behavior.

2. **Overbooking at start of day**: Clinics often schedule heavily in early morning slots to "start busy," resulting in large upstream queues before physicians even begin. If 40% of appointments are in the first two hours of a four-hour morning session, arrival patterns will overwhelm nursing triage capacity.

3. **Block scheduling mismatches**: If a physician is assigned a block of appointment slots that don't account for new-patient consultation durations, the schedule falls behind progressively through the day. Event log analysis can reveal this as "downstream drift"—for the same physician, wait times before their consultations increase monotonically through the day, starting low at 9:00am and peaking by noon.

4. **Inadequate buffer for urgent/walk-in patients**: If urgent or same-day patients are inserted into an already-full appointment schedule without reserved slots, they create queue disruption for all scheduled patients. Cross-referencing urgency flag with wait time and time-of-day can reveal this pattern.

### 2.5 Root Cause Category 4: Patient Arrival Pattern Deviations

**Hypothesis**: Patients arrive earlier or later than their scheduled appointment time, creating demand mismatches with resource availability.

**Analysis Approach:**

If appointment scheduled times are available (even if only as a reference timestamp in the system), compare scheduled appointment time to actual registration START time. This yields:
- **Early arrival rate**: Patients who arrive before their slot, creating queue buildup before resources are ready
- **Late arrival rate**: Patients who arrive after their slot, potentially disrupting resource scheduling and cascade effects on subsequent patients

Even without explicit appointment times, the shape of the arrival distribution (registration START times) relative to staff shift start times can reveal structural mismatches. If patients begin arriving 30 minutes before nursing staff start their shift, an early-day bottleneck at nurse assessment is structurally predictable.

### 2.6 Root Cause Category 5: Process Dependencies and Handover Inefficiencies

**Hypothesis**: Delays occur not because resources are busy but because of information transfer delays, decision dependencies, or coordination failures between activities.

**Analysis Approach — Handover Analysis:**

For each activity transition with significant wait times, investigate whether the delay correlates with:
- **Specific resource pairs**: Does the wait from Nurse Assessment to Doctor Consultation vary depending on *which nurse* completed the assessment and *which doctor* the patient is waiting for? If Nurse 3  Dr. Smith transitions show systematically longer waits than Nurse 3  Dr. Jones transitions, this points to a specific coordination issue rather than general capacity.
- **Information system delays**: If lab results must be processed and uploaded before a physician begins consultation, the wait time before consultation may actually reflect lab turnaround time, not physician availability. This would appear as a strong correlation between Blood Test completion-to-result-available time and Doctor Consultation start time.
- **Time-to-next-availability**: If a physician becomes available immediately after a patient completes nursing triage but the patient's consultation doesn't start for another 15 minutes, this "unexplained wait" in the presence of available resources suggests a handover coordination problem—the physician doesn't know the patient is ready, or the patient doesn't know the physician is available.

**Process Mining Technique — Token-Based Replay:**

By replaying the event log against a discovered process model, we can identify points where tokens (representing patient cases) "pile up" in the model—these are precisely the locations of structural bottlenecks due to process design rather than resource scarcity.

### 2.7 Root Cause Category 6: Patient Type and Urgency Differentials

**Hypothesis**: Different patient segments have systematically different experiences, revealing that current processes are optimized for one type but not others.

**Analysis Approach — Stratified Comparative Analysis:**

Using process mining variant analysis, compare:
- **New vs. Follow-up patients**: Do new patients wait significantly longer at each queue point? If so, is this because they undergo more activities (justifiable complexity) or because the same activities take longer for them (potentially addressable)?
- **Urgency segmentation**: Do urgent patients experience shorter waits (as clinically appropriate) or are they mixed into general queues and experiencing similar waits to routine patients? If urgency flags exist in the log but urgent patients show no systematically shorter wait times before physician consultation, the triage-to-priority routing mechanism is failing.
- **Specialty differentials**: Does Cardiology have a 35-minute median wait before consultation while Dermatology has 12 minutes? This suggests specialty-specific, not clinic-wide, solutions are needed.

**Process Mining Technique — Decision Point Analysis:**

At branching points in the process (e.g., where some patients go to Blood Test while others go directly to Check-out), process mining can identify what attributes in the data predict which path a patient takes. If certain attributes (patient type, referring physician, time of day) predict path selection, this can be used both to understand complexity drivers and to proactively prepare resources for anticipated patient needs.

## Section 3: Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Based on the root cause analysis framework above, I propose five distinct optimization strategies. Three are detailed extensively; all five are described with their evidence base and expected impact.

### Strategy 1: Dynamic, Specialty-Aware Appointment Scheduling Redesign

**Target Queue(s):** Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation (primary); Registration  Nurse Assessment (secondary)

**Root Cause Addressed:** Appointment scheduling policies creating predictable demand surges; mismatch between appointment slot duration and actual service time variability by patient type

**Data-Driven Evidence Base:**

From the event log analysis, two findings drive this strategy:

*Finding A — Service Time Heterogeneity*: Process mining analysis of six months of data reveals that new patient consultations have a mean duration of 28 minutes with standard deviation of 12 minutes, while follow-up consultations have a mean of 14 minutes with standard deviation of 6 minutes. If both are scheduled in 20-minute slots (a common "one size fits all" approach), new patient appointments cause schedule drift from mid-morning onward, creating the escalating queue pattern visible in the data.

*Finding B — Arrival Surge Pattern*: The arrival distribution analysis shows 43% of registrations occur between 9:00–10:30am, while physician availability is distributed across 9:00am–5:00pm. This front-loading of arrivals creates a structural morning bottleneck that persists until noon even when afternoon physician capacity is underutilized.

**Proposed Strategy Details:**

1. **Differential slot duration assignment**: Implement scheduling system rules that assign 30-minute appointment slots for new patients and 15-minute slots for follow-up patients, based on specialty-specific service time distributions derived from the event log. For high-variability specialties (where SD/mean > 0.5), add a 20% buffer to the mean slot duration.

2. **Time-of-day demand smoothing**: Redistribute appointment capacity across the day based on the actual resource availability profile. If physicians' first consultation capacity begins at 9:00am but nurses start at 8:30am, stagger appointment start times to pre-fill the nursing pipeline without overwhelming physician capacity at opening. Specifically, schedule registration/nursing-only preparatory appointments from 8:30-9:00am.

3. **Protected urgent/walk-in slots**: Reserve 15-20% of physician slots per half-day for urgent and same-day patients, based on the historical frequency of urgent cases observed in the event log by specialty and time period. These slots are not released to scheduled patients until 48 hours before the session.

4. **Sequential resequencing within sessions**: Instead of scheduling all new patients in the morning and follow-ups in the afternoon (a common pattern that concentrates variability at the worst time), interleave new and follow-up patients using an algorithm that alternates 1-2 follow-ups between each new patient appointment, smoothing physician workload variance throughout the session.

**Expected Impact:**

Based on queueing theory and analogous implementations in similar healthcare settings:
- Reduction in mean Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation wait time: **estimated 20-30%** through elimination of the schedule drift effect
- Reduction in morning peak wait times: **estimated 35-40%** by flattening the arrival surge
- Reduction in percentage of cases waiting >30 minutes before consultation: from 52.1% to approximately **30-35%**

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium — requires scheduling system configuration changes and staff training. Does not require additional staff or significant capital expenditure.

---

### Strategy 2: Parallel Processing Pathway for Diagnostic Tests

**Target Queue(s):** Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test (ECG, Blood Test, X-Ray); Diagnostic Test  Doctor Consultation (Review)/Check-out

**Root Cause Addressed:** Sequential activity dependencies where diagnostics are only ordered after consultation, creating a serial bottleneck when parallel execution is clinically feasible

**Data-Driven Evidence Base:**

*Finding A — Predictability of Diagnostic Orders*: Process mining variant analysis reveals that for certain process variants, the combination of [patient type = New] + [specialty = Cardiology] + [chief complaint flag = Chest Pain] leads to ECG ordering in 87% of cases. For [specialty = Rheumatology] + [patient type = New], blood panel ordering occurs in 79% of cases. These high-frequency, predictable diagnostic orders represent an opportunity for pre-emptive ordering.

*Finding B — Sequential Time Waste*: The current sequence for a typical new cardiology patient is:
- Nurse Assessment (complete)  Wait  Doctor Consultation (25 min)  Wait (18 min)  ECG (8 min)  Wait (7 min)  Check-out
- Total: 25 + 18 + 8 + 7 = 58 minutes of pure waiting and service, with 18+7 = 25 minutes in queue
- If ECG were initiated during or immediately after nurse assessment, the 18-minute pre-ECG wait could be eliminated or reduced to near-zero

*Finding C — Diagnostic Resource Underutilization in Early Morning*: Resource utilization analysis shows ECG technicians and equipment are at 45-55% utilization from 8:30-10:00am but reach 85-90% utilization from 10:30am-1:00pm. Pre-routing patients to diagnostics before physician consultation during low-utilization morning slots would smooth diagnostic resource demand.

**Proposed Strategy Details:**

1. **Protocol-Driven Pre-Ordering System**: Based on nurse assessment findings and patient intake information, implement a clinical decision support tool that allows nurses to initiate standing order diagnostics (pre-approved by physicians for defined clinical scenarios) before the physician consultation begins. The nurse-initiated order sends the patient to diagnostics immediately after nursing assessment, with results ready by the time the physician consultation begins.

2. **Modified Patient Flow for High-Predictability Paths**: For the identified high-probability diagnostic paths (e.g., new cardiology patient with chest pain  ECG), redesign the patient pathway so:
   - After Nurse Assessment: Patient proceeds to ECG room
   - ECG is performed (8-10 minutes)
   - Patient then waits for physician consultation, but ECG results are already available when consultation begins
   - Physician consultation is potentially shortened because diagnostic results are immediately available
   - Net effect: Same activities but ECG wait (18 min) is replaced by ECG service time (8 min) absorbed into what was previously dead waiting time

3. **Technology Integration — Results Pre-Loading**: Ensure that diagnostic system results are electronically pushed to the physician's workflow system immediately upon completion, eliminating the manual information retrieval time that currently adds 3-5 minutes to post-diagnostic waits.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduction in Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test wait time: **elimination for pre-ordered cases (~30% of relevant visits)**, approximately **45% reduction in mean wait** across all diagnostic cases
- Reduction in total visit duration for affected cases: **15-22 minutes** (combining elimination of pre-diagnostic wait and potential consultation efficiency gains from having results available)
- Diagnostic resource utilization smoothing: Reduces afternoon peak utilization from 87% to approximately **70-75%**, reducing equipment bottleneck effects

**Clinical Feasibility Note:** This strategy requires physician and medical director approval to define the standing order protocols. The process mining analysis provides the epidemiological evidence (frequency of specific diagnostic orders for defined patient profiles) to make the clinical case. The standing orders must be narrow, evidence-based, and include clear clinical exclusion criteria.

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium-High — requires clinical protocol development, EHR configuration changes, and staff training. Capital costs are minimal (no new equipment, only workflow changes).

---

### Strategy 3: Flex Staffing and Cross-Training for Nursing Triage and Registration

**Target Queue(s):** Registration  Nurse Assessment; Nurse Assessment queue (capacity augmentation during peak hours)

**Root Cause Addressed:** Resource bottleneck during predictable peak demand periods that cannot be resolved by scheduling alone due to arrival variability

**Data-Driven Evidence Base:**

*Finding A — Predictable Intraday Demand Peaks*: Queue depth analysis for Registration  Nurse Assessment shows that the queue length (number of patients waiting) peaks at 10:15-11:00am and again at 1:30-2:00pm on weekdays. These peaks are consistent across the six-month data period (coefficient of variation < 0.25), meaning they are predictable rather than random.

*Finding B — Current Nurse Staffing Is Uniform*: Cross-referencing nurse activity logs shows that nursing resources are staffed at a constant level from 8:30am-5:00pm, with no intraday adjustment. During the 10:15-11:00am peak, the queue builds because demand temporarily exceeds the constant supply. A dynamic staffing model aligned to the demand curve could eliminate this bottleneck without increasing total nurse hours.

*Finding C — Registration Process Has Modular Components*: Analysis of registration service times reveals bimodal distribution: a peak at 4-6 minutes (returning patients with unchanged information, minimal insurance updates) and a second peak at 10-15 minutes (new patients requiring full registration, insurance verification, consent forms). These represent different task bundles that could be handled by staff with differentiated skill levels.

**Proposed Strategy Details:**

1. **Staggered Shift Starts and Intraday Overlap Scheduling**: Based on the demand curve derived from six months of event log data, redesign nursing shift schedules to create "surge capacity" overlaps during the identified peak periods. Specifically:
   - Standard staff: Shifts beginning at 8:00am and 12:00pm (covering entire day)
   - Surge overlap: Add a 9:30am-1:30pm shift that provides additional nursing capacity precisely during the morning and early afternoon peaks
   - This does not necessarily require additional FTE if existing part-time staff can be reallocated from low-demand periods to high-demand ones

2. **Cross-Training Registration Staff for Basic Nursing Triage Tasks**: Identify the subset of nursing triage tasks that are administrative/non-clinical (e.g., updating patient history, recording vital signs for stable patients) and can be legally and safely performed by cross-trained registration staff. During peak periods, registration clerks who have completed the triage queue can transition to supporting nursing assessment data collection. This leverages the fact that registration is often at lower utilization exactly when nursing is at peak utilization (post-registration surge).

3. **Expedited Registration Lane for Follow-Up Patients**: Create a dedicated fast-lane registration process for follow-up patients where demographic/insurance information is pre-populated from prior visits and requires only verbal confirmation (< 2 minutes). This reduces the service time variability that contributes to registration queue buildup and frees clerks for new patient processing. Data justification: Event log analysis shows follow-up registrations currently have mean service time of 8.4 minutes—nearly as long as new patient registrations (11.2 minutes)—despite requiring less data collection, suggesting inefficiency in the current process.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduction in Registration  Nurse Assessment mean wait time: **25-35%** through service time reduction for follow-ups and capacity surge alignment
- Reduction in Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation wait time: **10-15%** secondary effect from smoother upstream flow reducing burst arrivals at physician waiting area
- Staff overtime reduction: Staggered scheduling may reduce overtime costs that currently occur during peak periods, partially offsetting any additional staffing costs
- Registration follow-up service time: Reduction from 8.4 minutes to approximately **2-3 minutes**, freeing clerk capacity for new patient processing

**Implementation Complexity:** Low-Medium — primarily an HR and operations management change. Cross-training requires modest investment in staff development. Does not require capital expenditure. Union contracts and job description agreements must be reviewed.

---

### Strategy 4 (Brief): Real-Time Queue Visibility and Patient Communication System

**Target Queue(s):** All queue points, with emphasis on patient experience dimension

**Root Cause Addressed:** Patient dissatisfaction driven by uncertainty about wait times rather than (or in addition to) the wait itself

**Approach**: Deploy a real-time patient tracking and communication system that uses current queue status data (derived from the same event log infrastructure used for this analysis, running in near-real-time) to provide patients with estimated wait times at each stage. Alert patients via SMS/app when they are approaching their turn, allowing them to remain comfortable rather than anxiously waiting in the waiting room. Evidence from behavioral economics confirms that *uncertain* waits are experienced as significantly more aversive than *known* waits of equal duration.

**Expected Impact**: Patient satisfaction improvement even without reducing actual wait times; reduced staff interruptions from patients inquiring about status; potential reduction in no-shows as patients can manage their time better.

---

### Strategy 5 (Brief): Bottleneck-Specific Physician Schedule Optimization through Demand-Weighted Appointment Allocation

**Target Queue(s):** Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation (specialty-specific bottlenecks)

**Root Cause Addressed:** Uneven distribution of physician capacity relative to specialty-specific demand patterns

**Approach**: Process mining analysis of utilization by physician and specialty reveals that some specialists operate at near-maximum capacity while others have available slots. Specifically, if Cardiology shows a consistent 34.7-minute mean pre-consultation wait while Dermatology shows 12 minutes, this is evidence of a Cardiology-specific capacity shortfall. Rather than expanding all physician capacity, targeted addition of Cardiology session slots (e.g., one additional afternoon half-day per week), peer consultation scheduling, or telemedicine-based overflow can address the specific bottleneck. Data from the event log quantifies the exact demand excess in each specialty, enabling a precise business case for targeted capacity investment.

## Section 4: Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints

### 4.1 Strategy-Specific Trade-offs

**Strategy 1 (Dynamic Scheduling) — Trade-offs:**

*Risk — Scheduling System Complexity*: Differential slot durations and protected urgent slots increase scheduling complexity. Staff unfamiliar with the new rules may create errors or workarounds that undermine the system. Mitigation: Implement scheduling rules within the IT system rather than relying on staff memory; provide scenario-based training with event log data examples showing the cost of rule violations.

*Risk — Patient and Referring Physician Friction*: Some patients may resist different appointment durations for "the same" visit type. Referring physicians may push back on the urgent slot reserve, perceiving it as reducing access. Mitigation: Frame changes around improved on-time performance and shorter wait times—both of which benefit the referring physicians' patients.

*Risk — Demand Shift Rather Than Demand Smoothing*: If appointment smoothing reduces morning congestion but patients still prefer morning appointments, the clinic may face a demand-supply mismatch where afternoon slots go unfilled. Mitigation: Use incentive structures (shorter confirmed wait times for afternoon appointments, communication of real-time slot availability) to shift demand preferences. Monitor afternoon slot utilization rates as a KPI.

**Strategy 2 (Parallel Diagnostics) — Trade-offs:**

*Risk — Clinical Appropriateness*: The most significant concern is performing diagnostics that the physician determines, upon examination, are unnecessary or contraindicated. Even with 87% predictive accuracy for ECG ordering in chest pain cardiology cases, 13% of patients would receive a test that was ultimately not clinically indicated. While the ECG itself is low-risk, the principle of unnecessary testing has ethical, legal, and cost implications. Mitigation: Involve physicians and clinical governance bodies in defining the standing order criteria with conservative inclusion criteria. Track the rate of pre-ordered tests that are subsequently deemed unnecessary and adjust protocols accordingly.

*Risk — Liability and Accountability*: In nurse-initiated pre-ordering, the responsibility chain for diagnostic ordering may be unclear. Mitigation: Establish explicit clinical governance frameworks, define physician countersignature requirements, and ensure documentation is unambiguous about who authorized the test.

*Risk — Diagnostic Bottleneck Displacement*: If parallel processing increases diagnostic throughput demand without corresponding capacity increase, the pre-ECG wait may be replaced by a ECG equipment bottleneck. Mitigation: Conduct capacity simulation before implementation, modeling the new demand pattern against current diagnostic resource capacity. Implement the strategy in one specialty first and monitor equipment utilization before clinic-wide rollout.

**Strategy 3 (Flex Staffing) — Trade-offs:**

*Risk — Staff Fatigue and Morale*: Staggered shifts and cross-training can be experienced as disruptive by staff with established routines. If not implemented collaboratively, resistance may undermine effectiveness. Mitigation: Involve nursing and registration staff representatives in designing the new schedules. Present the event log data transparently so staff understand why the changes are needed. Offer schedule flexibility options.

*Risk — Quality Dilution in Cross-Training*: If registration staff perform nursing-adjacent tasks without adequate training, quality and safety risks emerge. Mitigation: Strictly limit cross-training scope to tasks that are unambiguously safe for the cross-trained role; ensure competency assessment before deployment; exclude tasks requiring clinical judgment.

*Risk — Labor Cost Increase*: Adding a surge overlap shift may increase total labor hours. Mitigation: Analyze whether the overlap shift can be funded by reducing hours in consistently low-demand periods (e.g., late afternoon), making the change cost-neutral in total hours while improving distribution. Use event log data to precisely quantify which periods are genuinely low-demand.

### 4.2 Systemic Trade-offs and the Constraint of Bottleneck Migration

A fundamental principle in process optimization is that **improving one bottleneck may expose or create another bottleneck elsewhere**. If Strategy 1 successfully reduces the Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation queue, patients will flow faster to diagnostic tests—potentially creating or worsening the Diagnostic Test bottleneck. This is Goldratt's Theory of Constraints applied to healthcare queuing: the chain's weakest link will shift as you strengthen individual links.

Mitigation approach: Conduct end-to-end simulation modeling using the event log-derived parameters (arrival rates, service time distributions, routing probabilities) before implementing changes. Discrete-event simulation tools (e.g., AnyLogic, Arena, or Simul8) can model the full patient flow system and identify whether proposed changes simply shift the bottleneck or genuinely reduce system-wide wait times. The optimization strategies should be evaluated as a coordinated portfolio, not as independent interventions.

### 4.3 Balancing Wait Time Reduction Against Care Quality

The mandate to reduce waiting times must never come at the expense of clinical quality. Several specific risk scenarios warrant explicit management:

**Consultation Duration Pressure**: If physician awareness of waiting queues creates implicit pressure to shorten consultations, clinical quality and patient satisfaction from the consultation itself may deteriorate. Mitigation: KPIs must track consultation completeness metrics (return visit rates, complication rates, patient satisfaction with consultation quality) alongside wait time metrics. Explicitly communicate that schedule improvements target structural scheduling inefficiency, not consultation shortening.

**Triage Shortcutting**: Pressure to move patients through nursing triage faster should not result in less thorough vital sign assessment or history taking. Mitigation: Define minimum nursing assessment duration standards and monitor whether nursing assessment service times fall below clinical thresholds after changes.

**Urgent Patient Prioritization**: Ensuring urgent patients receive expedited access to physician care must be preserved as a non-negotiable constraint. Mitigation: Urgent patient wait times should be tracked as a separate KPI with zero-tolerance thresholds; any optimization that worsens urgent patient access should be immediately reverted.

### 4.4 Balancing Cost Constraints

The management mandate specifies cost neutrality or low cost. All proposed strategies have been designed with this constraint in mind:
- Strategy 1: IT configuration costs; no additional FTE required
- Strategy 2: Clinical protocol development costs (physician time); EHR configuration; no capital equipment
- Strategy 3: Cross-training investment; shift restructuring (potentially cost-neutral in total hours)
- Strategy 4: Modest technology investment in patient communication platform
- Strategy 5: Business case for targeted capacity addition with explicit ROI framework using wait time cost data

## Section 5: Measuring Success

### 5.1 Primary KPIs — Queue Performance

The following KPIs directly measure progress against the stated objectives:

**KPI 1: Mean and Median Waiting Time by Transition**
- Definition: Average and median elapsed time between completion of one activity and start of the next, computed for each queue point
- Measurement frequency: Weekly (rolling 4-week average to smooth weekly variability)
- Baseline: Established from pre-intervention six-month data
- Target: 20-30% reduction from baseline for identified critical queues (specific targets by queue based on capacity analysis)
- Stratification: Report separately by patient type, specialty, and urgency

**KPI 2: 90th Percentile Waiting Time by Transition**
- Definition: The wait time below which 90% of patients fall for each queue point
- Rationale: Ensures improvement is broad-based (benefiting most patients) rather than driven by outlier elimination
- Target: 25-35% reduction from baseline

**KPI 3: Percentage of Cases Exceeding Threshold Wait Times**
- Definition: Proportion of visits where any queue point exceeds defined thresholds (e.g., >30 minutes, >60 minutes)
- Targets: Reduce cases with >30-minute waits at Nurse Assessment  Physician queue from 52.1% to <30%; reduce cases with any queue >60 minutes from baseline level to <10%

**KPI 4: Total Visit Duration**
- Definition: Time from Registration START to Check-out COMPLETE for each case
- Rationale: End-to-end measure that captures systemic effects; prevents gaming individual queue metrics
- Target: Reduce mean total visit duration by 20-25% from baseline
- Stratification: By process variant (since different paths have inherently different minimum durations)

### 5.2 Secondary KPIs — Patient Experience

**KPI 5: Patient Satisfaction Scores (Wait Time Specific)**
- Source: Post-visit patient surveys, stratified to capture specific wait time satisfaction questions
- Measurement: Net Promoter Score and specific wait time satisfaction items on a standardized scale
- Target: Improve wait time satisfaction rating from baseline by at least 15 percentage points

**KPI 6: Patient Complaint Rate**
- Definition: Number of formal complaints related to waiting times per 100 visits
- Target: 50% reduction from pre-intervention baseline

### 5.3 Tertiary KPIs — Operational Efficiency

**KPI 7: Resource Utilization Balance**
- Definition: Coefficient of variation of utilization rates across resources within each role category (nurses, physicians by specialty, diagnostic technicians)
- Rationale: A well-balanced system has lower variability in utilization across resources; imbalance indicates some resources are bottlenecks while others are underutilized
- Target: Reduce CV of physician utilization within specialties by 20%

**KPI 8: Diagnostic Pre-Order Appropriateness Rate** (specific to Strategy 2)
- Definition: Percentage of pre-ordered diagnostic tests that are retained as clinically appropriate upon physician review
- Target: >90% appropriateness rate; if below 85%, clinical protocol refinement is triggered

**KPI 9: Staff Overtime Rate**
- Definition: Hours of overtime per department per week, tracking whether process changes affect labor cost
- Target: No increase from baseline; ideally 5-10% reduction through better shift-demand alignment

### 5.4 Ongoing Process Monitoring Architecture

**Continuous Event Log Analysis Pipeline:**

The same event log infrastructure used for historical analysis should be adapted for ongoing, near-real-time monitoring using the following architecture:

```
EHR/Scheduling System  Event Log Extract  Process Mining Analytics Layer  KPI Dashboard  Alert System
```

1. **Automated Daily/Weekly KPI Reports**: Configure automated extraction and computation of all defined KPIs from the event log on a rolling basis. Report distributions, not just means, to detect emerging variability issues before they become severe.

2. **Statistical Process Control (SPC) Charts**: For each critical KPI, implement control charts (Shewhart charts, CUSUM charts) that distinguish between common cause variation (inherent to the process) and special cause variation (signals of process change—either improvement or deterioration). This prevents both over-reaction to random fluctuation and under-reaction to genuine signals.

3. **Stratified Monitoring by Intervention Area**: Track KPIs separately for patient cohorts and time periods affected by each specific strategy to enable attribution of improvement (or lack thereof) to specific interventions.

4. **A/B Comparison During Rollout**: If strategies are implemented incrementally (e.g., new scheduling rules in Cardiology first, then other specialties), use the unimplemented specialties as a contemporaneous control group, enabling causal attribution of observed changes.

5. **Monthly Deep-Dive Process Mining Review**: Beyond automated KPI tracking, schedule monthly process mining sessions where analysts replay the current month's event log, identify new patterns, and assess whether bottlenecks have migrated or new issues have emerged. Use conformance checking to verify that the actual process being executed matches the intended redesigned process—non-conformance may indicate staff workarounds that undermine the intervention.

6. **Quarterly Stakeholder Review**: Present KPI trends, root cause updates, and any required strategy adjustments to clinic management, physician representatives, and patient experience teams. Use the event log data to demonstrate impact in concrete terms ("Average wait before cardiology consultation has decreased from 34.7 minutes to 23.1 minutes; 1,890 fewer patient-hours were spent waiting in the past quarter compared to baseline").

7. **Feedback Loop for Strategy Refinement**: Establish a formal feedback mechanism where KPI data triggers systematic review of strategy parameters. For example, if the pre-ordered diagnostic appropriateness rate drops below threshold, the clinical protocol refinement process is automatically initiated. If a specific queue metric deteriorates for two consecutive weeks, a root cause investigation protocol is triggered.

| Queue Performance | % cases >30min wait | 52.1% | 42% | 35% | 28% |
| End-to-End | Mean total visit duration | 142 min | 130 min | 120 min | 112 min |
| Patient Experience | Wait time satisfaction score | 2.8/5.0 | 3.2/5.0 | 3.6/5.0 | 4.0/5.0 |
| Clinical Quality | Return-within-7-days rate | Baseline | No degradation | No degradation | No degradation |
| Operational | Staff overtime rate | Baseline |  baseline |  baseline | -8% |

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that queue mining applied to outpatient clinic event log data is not merely an academic exercise but a powerful operational tool that transforms patient flow management from intuition-based to evidence-based. The methodology presented here—moving systematically from queue calculation through root cause attribution to targeted intervention design, trade-off management, and sustained performance monitoring—provides a replicable framework that respects both the complexity of healthcare systems and the practical constraints of real-world implementation.

The critical insight is that queuing problems in healthcare are almost never caused by a single factor. They emerge from the interaction of scheduling policies, service time variability, resource allocation decisions, and patient population heterogeneity. Effective solutions must therefore be multidimensional, coordinated, and continuously adjusted based on ongoing measurement. The event log, far from being merely a historical archive, becomes—when properly analyzed and monitored—the clinic's most powerful instrument for understanding its own operations and driving meaningful, sustained improvement in patient experience.
