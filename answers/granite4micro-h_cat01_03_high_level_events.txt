To tackle the task effectively, I'll follow the outlined instructions by first identifying high-level steps in the provided event log subset and then justifying these groupings. After that, each high-level activity will be named descriptively.

### High-Level Steps Identification

Given the sample data from two cases (A1 and B2), we can identify recurring patterns to propose meaningful high-level activities:

#### 1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Low-Level Events:** 
     - Retrieve raw metal sheet
     - Scan barcode
     - Place metal sheet on table
     - Align metal sheet
     - Preheat metal sheet

**Justification:**
These steps collectively represent the initial handling and preparation of a raw material component before any assembly or processing begins. They establish the foundational stage where materials are brought into the system, identified, positioned, aligned, and prepped for further operations.

#### 2. **Assembly**
   - **Low-Level Events:** 
     - Pick up welding tool
     - Weld corner A
     - Weld corner B

**Justification:**
These events collectively describe the assembly process where a component is brought together through welding or other fastening methods. This high-level step signifies the critical phase of joining individual parts to form a complete unit, which is essential for producing functional products.

#### 3. **Quality Assurance**
   - **Low-Level Events:** 
     - Measure weld integrity
     - Apply protective coating
     - Dry coating
     - Visual check

**Justification:**
These events represent the quality assurance and finishing phases of the manufacturing process. Measuring weld integrity ensures that the assembly is structurally sound, applying a protective coating safeguards the component from environmental degradation, drying it to achieve proper curing or hardening, and conducting a visual check confirms compliance with quality standards.

### Structured Representation of High-Level Activities

Below is a structured output representing the high-level activities derived from the event log:

### Summary

The high-level steps identified—Material Preparation, Assembly, and Quality Assurance—are designed to represent the broader stages of a manufacturing process. Each step is justified by grouping logically consecutive events that belong to a singular operational or quality phase. The names chosen reflect the core function of each group in the production workflow. This methodical approach simplifies understanding of the manufacturing process by distilling complex event sequences into comprehensible, actionable steps.
