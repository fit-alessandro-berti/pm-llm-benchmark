**1. Violations of Normative Rules:**

* **Case 2:** Violates the sequence of activities by performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check. This contradicts the strict order requirement that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. The risk assessment was conducted at 08:20 AM, while the credit check happened later at 09:00 AM, highlighting this issue.
* **Case 2:** Performs Finalize Documentation after a loan rejection (Rejected status at 09:30 AM, Finalize Documentation at 10:00 AM). This directly violates the rule that finalizing documentation should not occur after a rejection. 

**2. Desiderata Violations:**

* **Cases 2 and 3:** The Credit Check in Case 3 took place more than 24 hours after the application was received (January 12th, 9:00 AM). This delays meeting the recommended timeline for a timely credit check process. While this isn't a serious violation, it indicates a potential area for improvement to enhance efficiency.
* **Case 3:** The Inform Applicant step occurred over 48 hours after the loan decision (Approved status at 12:00 PM on January 14th, Inform Applicant at 15:00 PM on January 16th). This exceeds the recommended timeline for informing applicants promptly. Similar to the credit check delay, this is a suboptimal practice but not necessarily problematic.
* **All Cases:** The absence of a Follow-up Call in all cases violates the desideratum of performing such a call before closing the case. While not essential, this interaction could help ensure applicant satisfaction and clarity regarding the loan process.

**Interpretations/Justifications:**


* **Case 2:** The likely explanation for the out-of-order activities is potential human error or a misunderstanding of the strict sequence requirements. It's important to review the training materials and procedures to ensure that employees are fully aware of the correct order and are following it consistently.
* **Cases 2 & 3 (Credit Check Delay):** Delays could be due to various factors like system performance, data availability, or prioritization of other tasks. However, implementing mechanisms to monitor and manage these delays can help ensure compliance with the recommended timeframe.
* **Case 3 (Inform Applicant Delay):** Potential reasons could include heavy workload, communication bottlenecks within the team, or insufficient tools for timely information dissemination. Addressing these underlying issues can improve overall process efficiency.
