Here is a structured BPMN-like textual process model based on the interview excerpts:

### **Invoice Approval Process Model**

#### **Activities/Tasks:**
1. **Receive Invoice** (Input: Invoice document)
   - Trigger: Invoice arrives by email.
   - Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).

2. **Check for Valid PO**
   - Decision: If no PO  Return to Supplier.
   - If PO exists  Proceed.
   - Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).

3. **Log Invoice in System**
   - Input: Invoice + PO reference.
   - Output: Logged entry in accounting system.
   - Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).

4. **Forward to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation**
   - Trigger: Logged invoice.
   - Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
   - Input: PO number.
   - Output: Confirmation from Purchasing (Dan).

5. **Match Invoice to PO in System**
   - Decision: If mismatch  Escalate to Purchasing (Dan) or Supervisor (Rita).
   - If matched  Proceed.
   - Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).

6. **Purchasing Review & Confirmation**
   - Input: PO + Invoice.
   - Decision: If discrepancy  Resolve with Supplier (via Karen or Mary) or Escalate.
   - If no issues  Send confirmation to AP.
   - Performed by: Purchasing Officer (Dan).

7. **Manager Approval**
   - Input: Approved invoice + PO + Purchasing confirmation.
   - Decision: If suspicious  Reject/Request Clarification.
   - If approved  Proceed.
   - Performed by: Department Manager (Carlos).

8. **Schedule for Payment**
   - Input: Approved invoice.
   - Output: Added to payment cycle.
   - Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).

#### **Sequence Flow:**
1. **Receive Invoice** 
   (If no PO)  **Return to Supplier**  End.
   (If PO exists)  **Log Invoice in System** 
   **Forward to Purchasing** 
   (If discrepancy)  **Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)/Supplier Manager (Karen)** 
   (If resolved)  **Match Invoice to PO** 
   (If mismatch)  **Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)/Supplier Manager (Karen)** 
   (If matched)  **Purchasing Review** 
   (If discrepancy)  **Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)/Supplier Manager (Karen)** 
   (If confirmed)  **Manager Approval** 
   (If rejected)  **Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)/Supplier Manager (Karen)** 
   (If approved)  **Schedule for Payment**  End.

#### **Gateways/Decision Points:**
1. **No Valid PO**  Return to Supplier.
2. **PO Mismatch**  Escalate to Purchasing/Supervisor.
3. **Purchasing Review Issues**  Escalate to Supervisor/Supplier Manager.
4. **Manager Approval Check**  Reject if suspicious.

#### **Roles/Participants:**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Handles initial validation, logging, and payment scheduling.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Confirms receipt and matches invoice to PO.
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Final approval authority.
- **Supervisor (Rita):** Resolves exceptions and escalations.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Assists in resolving supplier-related discrepancies.

#### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
- **Inputs:** Invoice (email), Purchase Order (PO).
- **Outputs:** Logged invoice entry, Approved invoice, Payment schedule entry.

#### **Exceptions/Variations:**
1. **Missing PO:** Returned to supplier for correction.
2. **Invoice-PO Mismatch:** Escalated for resolution (e.g., pricing errors, missing items).
3. **Manager Rejection:** Escalated to Supervisor for further review.
4. **Non-PO Invoices:** Handled by Supervisor (Rita) and Department Heads (retrospective PO or rejection).

#### **Ambiguities:**
- The exact trigger for Manager (Carlos) approval (email notification or system alert) is unclear.
- The role of the Supervisor (Rita) in non-PO invoices is implied but not explicitly detailed.

This model captures the core workflow while noting exceptions and ambiguities. It can be directly translated into a BPMN diagram.

**Next Steps:**
- Clarify the automated notifications (e.g., Manager approval triggers).
- Define the exact steps for resolving non-PO invoices (e.g., retroactive PO creation).
- Validate with stakeholders to ensure all edge cases are covered.
