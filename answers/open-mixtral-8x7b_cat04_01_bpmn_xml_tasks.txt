Based on the provided BPMN 2.0 XML, the tasks in the process model are:

1. decide (exclusive gateway that follows the task, but it's not a task itself)
2. check ticket
3. examine casually
4. register request
5. reject request
6. examine thoroughly
7. reinitiate request
8. pay compensation

Please note that the element with the id "decide" is an Exclusive Gateway, which is a type of gateway and not a task. However, I included it in the list because it immediately follows a task in the XML and might be relevant in the context of the process model.
