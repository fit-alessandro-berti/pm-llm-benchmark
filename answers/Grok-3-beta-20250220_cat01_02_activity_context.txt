### Analysis and Renaming of Activities

In the provided event log, three activities—"Verify Documents," "Call Customer," and "Initiate Request"—appear multiple times within individual cases, and their contextual meanings vary based on timing, resources, and additional context. Below, I analyze these recurring activities and propose renamed versions to reflect their distinct roles in the workflow.

#### 1. **Activity: "Verify Documents"**
- **Observation**: Appears twice in cases C001 and C003, with different purposes:
  - **C001**: First occurrence (09:20) is an initial check by a BackOfficeAgent; second (10:30) is a re-check after the customer submits additional documents.
  - **C003**: First occurrence (11:25) is an initial physical verification by a BranchOfficer; second (12:20) is a re-verification after an account adjustment.
- **Renaming**:
  - First occurrence → "Initial Doc Verification"
  - Second occurrence → "Re-Verify Documents"
- **Justification**: "Initial Doc Verification" indicates the first pass at checking identity or documents, while "Re-Verify Documents" reflects a follow-up verification triggered by new submissions or adjustments.

#### 2. **Activity: "Call Customer"**
- **Observation**: Appears twice in cases C002 and once in others, with varying purposes:
  - **C001**: Single call (09:45) to request missing documents.
  - **C002**: First call (09:00) to clarify an account discrepancy; second call (09:50) to confirm adjustments.
  - **C003**: Single call (11:50) to召回 a customer who stepped out.
- **Renaming**:
  - C001 → "Request Docs Call"
  - C002 (first) → "Clarify Issue Call"
  - C002 (second) → "Confirm Adjustment Call"
  - C003 → "Recall Customer Call"
- **Justification**: The renaming reflects the specific intent of each call—requesting documents, clarifying issues, confirming changes, or recalling the customer—based on the additional context and process flow.

#### 3. **Activity: "Initiate Request"**
- **Observation**: Appears once per case but with different entry points:
  - **C001 & C002**: Submitted via WebPortal (online).
  - **C003**: Submitted in-person at a branch.
- **Renaming**:
  - C001 & C002 → "Online Request Submission"
  - C003 → "In-Person Request Submission"
- **Justification**: The distinction between online and in-person submissions clarifies the channel through which the process begins, which may influence subsequent steps.

#### Other Activities
- **Submit Additional**, **Adjust Account**, and **Approve Request** appear once per case with consistent meanings, so no renaming is needed.

### Justification of Naming Choices

1. **"Initial Doc Verification" vs. "Re-Verify Documents"**:
   - **Clue**: The first verification occurs early in the process as a starting point, while the second happens after additional inputs (e.g., customer uploads in C001 or account adjustments in C003). "Re-Verify" emphasizes the iterative nature.
   
2. **"Request Docs Call," "Clarify Issue Call," "Confirm Adjustment Call," "Recall Customer Call"**:
   - **Clue**: The "Additional Context" column specifies the purpose of each call (e.g., requesting documents in C001, clarifying discrepancies in C002, or recalling a customer in C003). The new names align with these distinct objectives.

3. **"Online Request Submission" vs. "In-Person Request Submission"**:
   - **Clue**: The "Resource" column (WebPortal vs. BranchReception) indicates the submission channel, which sets the stage for different workflows (e.g., online vs. physical verification).

These renamed activities enhance clarity, ensuring that each step’s role in the process is unambiguous and contextually meaningful.
