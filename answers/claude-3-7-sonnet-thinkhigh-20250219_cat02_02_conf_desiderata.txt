# Loan Application Process Compliance Analysis

## 1. Normative Rule Violations

### Case 1
**Status**: Compliant with all normative rules
- All activities are in the correct sequence
- Credit Check performed before Risk Assessment
- For an approved loan, Documentation was finalized before closing

### Case 2
**Status**: Multiple normative violations
- **Ordering Violation**: Risk Assessment (08:20) performed before Credit Check (09:00), which violates the required sequence
- **Missing Activity**: "Inform Applicant" step is completely absent from the process
- **Prohibited Activity**: Documentation was finalized after a loan rejection, which is explicitly not allowed

### Case 3
**Status**: Compliant with all normative rules
- All mandatory activities are present in the correct sequence
- All ordering rules are followed correctly
- Documentation properly finalized before closing for the approved loan

## 2. Desiderata Conditions Not Met

### Case 1
- **Follow-up Call**: Not performed before closing the case

### Case 2
- **Follow-up Call**: Not performed before closing the case

### Case 3
- **Credit Check Timing**: Performed after 2 days (2024-01-14 10:00) rather than within the recommended 24 hours after application receipt (2024-01-12 09:00)
- **Inform Applicant Timing**: Notification occurred approximately 51 hours after the loan decision, exceeding the recommended 48-hour timeframe
- **Follow-up Call**: Not performed before closing the case

## 3. Interpretations and Suggestions

### Case 1
This case demonstrates an exemplary execution of the loan process from a compliance perspective. The only improvement would be adding a Follow-up Call before closing.

### Case 2
This case shows serious processing errors. Possible explanations:
- The processor may have misunderstood the required sequence, performing risk assessment prematurely
- The rejection notification may have been conducted but not logged
- Documentation finalization after rejection suggests a procedural misunderstanding or system error

**Recommendations**:
- Provide retraining on the correct process sequence
- Implement system controls to prevent out-of-sequence activities
- Add validation checks to prevent documentation finalization after rejections

### Case 3
This case follows all required rules but with timing delays. Possible justifications:
- The delay in credit check might be due to high application volume or weekend processing limitations
- The delayed applicant notification could be due to workload issues or waiting for additional information

**Recommendations**:
- Review staffing levels to ensure timely processing
- Implement reminder alerts for activities approaching time limits
- Consider automated notifications for applicants to reduce manual delays

While the desiderata violations do not constitute serious compliance issues, addressing them would improve customer experience and operational efficiency.
