# Analysis of Loan Application Process Compliance

## 1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Requirements)

### **Case 1:  COMPLIANT**
All normative rules are satisfied:
- Correct sequence maintained
- Credit Check (09:30)  Risk Assessment (10:00)  Loan Decision (11:00)
- Loan approved  Documentation finalized (13:30)  Case closed (14:00)
- Applicant properly informed after decision

### **Case 2:  MAJOR VIOLATIONS**
This case contains **three critical normative violations**:

1. **Ordering Violation: Risk Assessment Before Credit Check**
   - Risk Assessment occurred at 08:20
   - Credit Check occurred at 09:00
   - **Violation:** Credit Check MUST occur before Risk Assessment
   - **Impact:** Risk was evaluated without credit information, undermining decision quality

2. **Missing Mandatory Activity: Inform Applicant**
   - After Loan Decision (09:30), the process jumped to Finalize Documentation (10:00)
   - **Violation:** "Inform Applicant" is a required step after every Loan Decision
   - **Impact:** Applicant was never notified of the rejection

3. **Prohibited Activity: Finalize Documentation After Rejection**
   - Loan was rejected at 09:30
   - Documentation was finalized at 10:00
   - **Violation:** Documentation should ONLY be finalized for approved loans
   - **Impact:** Contradictory process execution; resources wasted on rejected application

**Severity:** Case 2 represents a fundamentally flawed execution with multiple serious compliance failures.

### **Case 3:  COMPLIANT**
All normative rules are satisfied:
- Correct sequence maintained throughout
- Proper ordering: Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision
- Loan approved  Documentation finalized  Case closed
- All mandatory activities present

## 2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended Best Practices)

### **Case 1: Minor Desideratum Issue**
-  Credit Check completed within 30 minutes (well within 24-hour recommendation)
-  Applicant informed within 2 hours (well within 48-hour recommendation)
-  **Missing Follow-up Call** (encouraged but not required)

**Assessment:** Near-optimal execution; only missing the optional follow-up call.

### **Case 2: Multiple Issues (Beyond Normative Violations)**
While the normative violations are the primary concern:
-  Credit Check timing would have been acceptable (1 hour)
-  **No Follow-up Call**
- Note: Timing for "Inform Applicant" cannot be assessed since this activity was missing entirely (normative violation)

**Assessment:** Desiderata issues are overshadowed by critical normative failures.

### **Case 3:  Multiple Desideratum Violations**

1. **Delayed Credit Check**
   - Application received: Jan 12, 09:00
   - Credit Check performed: Jan 14, 10:00
   - **Delay:** 49 hours (exceeds 24-hour recommendation by ~25 hours)
   - **Impact:** Slowed process initiation; applicant left waiting

2. **Delayed Applicant Notification**
   - Loan Decision made: Jan 14, 12:00
   - Applicant informed: Jan 16, 15:00
   - **Delay:** 51 hours (exceeds 48-hour recommendation by 3 hours)
   - **Impact:** Extended applicant uncertainty period

3. **Missing Follow-up Call**
   - No follow-up call recorded before case closure
   - **Impact:** Missed opportunity to ensure alignment and satisfaction

**Assessment:** While structurally correct, this case exhibits suboptimal timing and missed engagement opportunities. The delays suggest resource constraints or process inefficiencies.

## 3. Interpretations and Contextual Considerations

### **Case 1 Interpretation:**
This represents the **ideal execution** of the process. The only "gap" is the absence of a follow-up call, which might be justified if:
- The applicant explicitly declined the call
- The documentation process was straightforward with no questions
- Resource prioritization focused on other cases

### **Case 2 Interpretation:**
This case appears to reflect either:
- **Systemic process failure:** Perhaps a new employee or system error caused activities to execute out of order
- **Critical data entry errors:** The timestamps or activities may have been logged incorrectly
- **Deliberate deviation under pressure:** Possibly rushed due to deadline pressures, leading to corner-cutting

**Recommendation:** This case requires immediate investigation and corrective action. The multiple violations suggest either inadequate training, flawed process automation, or intentional non-compliance.

### **Case 3 Interpretation:**
The desiderata violations suggest **capacity or workload issues**:
- The 2-day delay before Credit Check initiation indicates:
  - Weekend or holiday intervening (Jan 12 was Friday, Jan 14 was Sunday/Monday?)
  - Backlog in the credit checking department
  - Staffing shortages

- The 51-hour delay in informing the applicant similarly suggests:
  - Resource constraints
  - Batching of notifications
  - Additional internal reviews for approved loans

**While not ideal**, these delays don't compromise the process integrity—they merely reduce efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Summary Table

| Case | Normative Compliance | Desiderata Compliance | Overall Assessment |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1    |  Full compliance   |  Minor (no follow-up call) | **Excellent** |
| 2    |  **3 major violations** |  Multiple issues | **Unacceptable - requires investigation** |
| 3    |  Full compliance   |  Timing delays + no follow-up | **Acceptable but suboptimal** |

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action for Case 2:**
   - Investigate root cause of sequence violations
   - Contact applicant to properly communicate rejection
   - Review why documentation was finalized for rejected application
   - Implement process controls to prevent ordering violations

2. **Process Improvements for Desiderata:**
   - Establish SLA monitoring for credit check and notification timing
   - Create automated alerts when activities exceed recommended timeframes
   - Make follow-up calls more systematic (perhaps automated scheduling)

3. **Training and Awareness:**
   - Reinforce the distinction between mandatory rules and best practices
   - Clarify that while desiderata can be flexed under constraints, normative rules are non-negotiable
