Based on the analysis of the normative process description and the event log, the following cases deviate from the intended process flow.

**Cases Violating the Normative Process:**

The cases that violate the normative process are **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5**.

### **Explanation of Violations**

Here is a detailed explanation of the rules being violated in each deviant case.

#### **Case 2: Deviation**

*   **Sequence of Activities:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> **Package items -> Authorize payment** -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Violation:** The order of activities is incorrect. The `Package items` activity occurs before `Authorize payment`.
*   **Explanation:** The normative description explicitly states the required sequence for a standard fulfillment: "...after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment... Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'" This establishes a clear rule that **payment must be authorized before items are packaged**. Case 2 violates this rule by packaging the items at 10:00, before authorizing payment at 10:30.

#### **Case 3: Deviation**

*   **Sequence of Activities:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> **Cancel order -> Ship order** -> Close order
*   **Violations:** This case contains multiple, severe violations of the process logic.
    1.  **Mixing Mutually Exclusive Paths:** The process includes activities from both the fulfillment path (`Authorize payment`) and the cancellation path (`Cancel order`). According to the description, `Authorize payment` is part of the "inventory is sufficient" scenario, while `Cancel order` is the primary step for the "inventory is not enough" scenario. Performing both indicates a fundamental breakdown in process logic.
    2.  **Shipping a Canceled Order:** The process proceeds to `Ship order` after the order has already been canceled. The normative description is very clear on this point: "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)..." Shipping an order that has been marked as canceled is a direct contradiction of the process rules.

#### **Case 5: Deviation**

*   **Sequence of Activities:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> **Ship order** -> Close order
*   **Violation:** A mandatory activity was skipped. The `Package items` activity is missing from the sequence.
*   **Explanation:** The normative description for a successful order fulfillment outlines a specific sequence: `Authorize Payment` -> `Package items` -> `Ship order`. It states, "**Only after items have been properly packaged** is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" In Case 5, the process jumps directly from `Authorize payment` to `Ship order`, skipping the essential preparation step of packaging. This violates the required process flow.

### **Conforming Cases**

For completeness, here is a summary of the cases that correctly follow the normative process.

*   **Case 1:** This case perfectly follows the "happy path" or standard fulfillment scenario: Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Package -> Ship -> Close. All activities are present and in the correct order.
*   **Case 4:** This case perfectly follows the cancellation scenario: Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close. It correctly branches after the inventory check and proceeds directly to cancellation and closure, without any improper fulfillment activities.
