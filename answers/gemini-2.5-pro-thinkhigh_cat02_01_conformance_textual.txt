Based on the analysis of the normative process description and the provided event log, the following cases violate the intended process flow.

### **Summary of Findings**

*   **Conformant Cases:** Case 1, Case 4
*   **Violating Cases:** Case 2, Case 3, Case 5

### **Detailed Explanation of Violations**

#### **Case 2: Violation Identified**

**Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> **Package items -> Authorize payment** -> Ship order -> Close order

**Explanation of Violation:**

This case violates the rule that payment must be authorized *before* items are packaged. The normative description clearly states the sequence for a successful fulfillment: "...after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment... Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'"

In Case 2, the `Package items` activity occurs at 10:00, while `Authorize payment` occurs later at 10:30. This is a direct reversal of the required order and represents a significant process deviation. The company risks preparing an order for a customer whose payment might ultimately be declined.

#### **Case 3: Multiple Violations Identified**

**Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> **Cancel order -> Ship order** -> Close order

**Explanation of Violations:**

This case contains two major violations of the normative process.

1.  **Shipping After Cancellation:** The most severe violation is shipping an order that has been canceled. The normative description is explicit on this point: "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)... 'Ship order' should... never after a cancellation." In this case, `Ship order` occurs *after* `Cancel order`, which is a direct contradiction of a core process rule.

2.  **Incorrect Cancellation Path:** The process for insufficient inventory is described as `Check inventory` -> `Cancel order` -> `Close order`. Case 3 incorrectly inserts `Authorize payment` before the cancellation. While the description doesn't explicitly forbid this, it states that in a cancellation scenario, the process should "**directly proceed** to 'Cancel order'" after the inventory check. Authorizing payment for an order that is about to be canceled due to a lack of stock is illogical and inefficient.

#### **Case 5: Violation Identified**

**Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> **Ship order** -> Close order

**Explanation of Violation:**

This case violates the process by skipping a mandatory activity. The normative description outlines a clear sequence for fulfillment: `Authorize payment` -> `Package items` -> `Ship order`. It explicitly notes, "Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'."

In Case 5, the `Package items` activity is missing entirely. The process jumps directly from `Authorize payment` to `Ship order`. This is a deviation because it skips the crucial step of preparing the items for shipment, which is defined as a required activity in the "happy path" scenario.

### **Analysis of Conformant Cases**

For completeness, the following cases adhere to the normative process:

*   **Case 1:** This case perfectly follows the "happy path" sequence described in the text: `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Authorize payment` -> `Package items` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`.
*   **Case 4:** This case perfectly follows the "cancellation scenario" sequence: `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Cancel order` -> `Close order`.
