Alright — let’s walk through the logs carefully, compare them to the **"normal process flow"** you described, identify where the deviations are, hypothesize their potential causes, and then propose **SQL queries** that would help you investigate further in the database.

## **1. Identify Anomalies in Event Order and Execution**

**Expected sequence:**
1. Register Order   
2. Perform Credit Check   
3. Validate Stock   
4. Confirm Shipment   
5. Ship Goods   
6. Issue Invoice   
7. Receive Payment

---

### **Case-by-case analysis:**

#### **Case 1001**  Normal Process
- Events occur in correct order, no missing steps.
- All activities are completed sequentially according to expected process.

---

#### **Case 1002**  Major anomaly: Logistics actions before credit check & stock validation
- Confirm Shipment (**step 4**) and Ship Goods (**step 5**) happen **before** Perform Credit Check (**step 2**) and Validate Stock (**step 3**).  
- This means the goods were shipped before stock and credit validations were completed. **High operational risk.**
- Potential cause:  
  - Manual override in logistics  
  - Urgent priority orders skipping formal checks  
  - System design flaw not enforcing order of activities

---

#### **Case 1003**  Shipment before confirmation, late confirmation
- Ship Goods occurs immediately after credit check, **before stock validation and shipment confirmation**.
- Confirm Shipment happens **after** goods have already shipped (late_confirmation=Y in additional_info).
- Potential cause:  
  - Paperwork delays  
  - Post-shipment administrative updates  
  - Retroactive confirmation caused by logistics system lag

---

#### **Case 1004**  Payment before invoicing & before shipment
- Receive Payment (**step 7**) happens right after order registration — before issue invoice and shipment steps.
- Possible cause:  
  - Prepaid orders  
  - Corporate accounts with standing deposit  
  - Manual payment mistakenly recorded too early

---

### **Summary of Anomalies**
| Case ID | Anomaly | Potential Source |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| 1002 | Shipment before credit check & stock validation | Priority order rush, policy override, or system flaw |
| 1003 | Goods shipped before confirmation | Delay in confirmation process, admin error |
| 1004 | Payment before invoicing/shipment | Prepayment, incorrect data entry |

---

## **2. Hypotheses and Possible Root Causes**

### Hypothesis 1 — **Policy Overrides for Urgency**
- Priority orders may be allowed to skip certain steps or have them done in parallel.
- Could be a specific policy for high-value clients or urgent orders.
- Need to check for correlation between `order_type` and policy deviations.

### Hypothesis 2 — **System Design Flaws**
- Workflow system might not strictly enforce sequence constraints between activities.
- This could be allowing out-of-order execution.

### Hypothesis 3 — **Human Error or Administrative Lag**
- Data entry delays or batch updates could make some events appear out-of-order.
- Particularly likely when confirmation happens after physical shipment.

### Hypothesis 4 — **Payment Policies**
- Some customers might prepay.
- Payment received before invoice might be a contract arrangement.

## **3. Investigation Queries**

Below are **SQL examples** to explore the anomalies and test the hypotheses:

---

### **Query A – Detect Out-of-Sequence Steps**
Find orders where **Ship Goods** happens before **Perform Credit Check** or **Validate Stock**.

```sql
SELECT oel.case_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) AS credit_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) AS stock_time
FROM order_event_log oel
GROUP BY oel.case_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) <
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END)
   OR  MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) <
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END);
```

---

### **Query B – Find Late Shipment Confirmations (after shipping)**

```sql
SELECT case_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_time
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN timestamp END) >
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END);
```

---

### **Query C – Identify Payments before Invoice**
  
```sql
SELECT case_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS payment_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS invoice_time
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) <
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END);
```

---

### **Query D – Check if Order Type or Value Correlates with Rule Breaking**
  
```sql
SELECT o.order_type,
       COUNT(DISTINCT oel.case_id) AS total_orders,
       SUM(CASE WHEN sg.ship_time < cc.credit_time OR sg.ship_time < vs.stock_time THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS violations
FROM orders o
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_time,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) AS credit_time,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) AS stock_time
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) sg ON o.case_id = sg.case_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT case_id,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) AS credit_time
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) cc ON o.case_id = cc.case_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT case_id,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) AS stock_time
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) vs ON o.case_id = vs.case_id
GROUP BY o.order_type;
```

---

### **Query E – Investigate Resources Involved in Deviations**
  
```sql
SELECT r.role, r.department, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT oel.case_id) AS deviation_cases
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) <
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END)
) anomaly_cases ON oel.case_id = anomaly_cases.case_id
GROUP BY r.role, r.department
ORDER BY deviation_cases DESC;
```

---

## **4. Next Steps**
- Use **Query D** to see if priority orders are more prone to rule violations.
- Use **Query E** to see if certain departments or individuals are more involved in sequence anomalies.
- Correlate anomaly orders with financial impact by joining with `orders` on `order_value`.
- Use interval checks to measure **time lags** between key steps.

If you want, I can **extend this** into a **"process conformance checker" SQL view** that automatically flags all deviations from the normal sequence for any order in the future — so analysts don't have to manually run multiple queries.  

Do you want me to build that automated anomaly-detection SQL view next?
