We are given a set of activities: 
    SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS.

We are to create a temporal profile dictionary for pairs of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution.
Note: The pairs are for activities that appear in order in a trace, not necessarily consecutive. For example, in a trace <SS, OP, RC, ...>, we consider (SS, OP), (SS, RC), etc.

We are to estimate the average time and standard deviation for each pair. We must consider the process flow and typical delays in a supply chain for high-tech electronics.

Let's think about the typical flow:

1. Supplier Selection (SS) -> Order Placement (OP): This is usually quick, maybe a few days. But note: in complex supply chains, supplier selection might involve negotiations, so it could take some time. Let's assume it takes on average 2 days with a standard deviation of 1 day (because sometimes it's quick, sometimes longer).

2. Order Placement (OP) -> Receive Components (RC): This is the lead time from the supplier. For high-tech components, it might take weeks. Let's say average 14 days, with a standard deviation of 3 days (due to supplier reliability, shipping, etc.).

3. Receive Components (RC) -> Quality Inspection (QI): Usually done soon after receiving, maybe within a day. Average 1 day, standard deviation 0.5 days.

4. Quality Inspection (QI) -> Component Assembly (CA): If components pass, assembly starts soon. Average 0.5 days, standard deviation 0.25 days.

5. Component Assembly (CA) -> Product Testing (PT): Assembly might take a few days. Let's say average 3 days, standard deviation 1 day.

6. Product Testing (PT) -> Packaging (PK): If testing passes, packaging is quick. Average 0.5 days, standard deviation 0.2 days.

7. Packaging (PK) -> Warehouse Storage (WS): Immediately after packaging, it goes to storage. Average 0.1 days (a couple of hours), standard deviation 0.05 days.

8. Warehouse Storage (WS) -> Distribution (DT): This depends on orders and shipping schedules. Might take a few days. Average 2 days, standard deviation 1 day.

9. Distribution (DT) -> After-Sales Support (AS): After distribution, support is ongoing, but we consider the time until the first after-sales activity. This might be weeks after distribution. Average 30 days, standard deviation 10 days.

Now, we also consider pairs that are not consecutive. For example:

- SS -> RC: This is SS->OP + OP->RC, so average = 2 + 14 = 16 days, standard deviation = sqrt(1^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(10)  3.16 days.

- SS -> QI: SS->OP + OP->RC + RC->QI = 2+14+1 = 17 days, stdev = sqrt(1^2 + 3^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(1+9+0.25)=sqrt(10.25)3.20 days.

We can compute for many pairs.

But note: The process might not be strictly linear. For example, after Quality Inspection, if components fail, they might be returned and reordered, but we are considering the successful path. Also, there might be loops, but for simplicity, we assume a linear successful path.

However, the problem says "eventually follow each other in at least one process execution." In a linear process, every activity eventually follows every earlier activity. So for 10 activities, we have 10*9/2 = 45 pairs. But we are to include a representative subset. We don't have to list all 45, but we should include enough to be representative and complex.

We'll include pairs that are consecutive and some that are separated by multiple steps.

Let's list the activities in order: 
    SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS.

We'll generate the dictionary for the consecutive pairs and then for some non-consecutive ones.

We'll use units of seconds. The example used seconds. Let's convert days to seconds: 1 day = 86400 seconds.

We'll use:

SS->OP: average 2 days = 172800 seconds, stdev 1 day = 86400 seconds.
OP->RC: average 14 days = 1209600 seconds, stdev 3 days = 259200 seconds.
RC->QI: average 1 day = 86400 seconds, stdev 0.5 days = 43200 seconds.
QI->CA: average 0.5 days = 43200 seconds, stdev 0.25 days = 21600 seconds.
CA->PT: average 3 days = 259200 seconds, stdev 1 day = 86400 seconds.
PT->PK: average 0.5 days = 43200 seconds, stdev 0.2 days = 17280 seconds.
PK->WS: average 0.1 days = 8640 seconds, stdev 0.05 days = 4320 seconds.
WS->DT: average 2 days = 172800 seconds, stdev 1 day = 86400 seconds.
DT->AS: average 30 days = 2592000 seconds, stdev 10 days = 864000 seconds.

Now, for non-consecutive pairs, we can compute the average as the sum of the averages of the intermediate steps, and the standard deviation as the square root of the sum of variances.

But note: The standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of the variances. We assume the times are independent.

We'll compute for some pairs:

- SS->RC: average = 172800 + 1209600 = 1382400 seconds, stdev = sqrt(86400^2 + 259200^2) = sqrt(7464960000 + 67184640000) = sqrt(7464960000+67184640000) = sqrt(74649600000) = 273040.3? Let's compute carefully:

86400^2 = 7,464,960,000
259200^2 = 67,184,640,000
Sum = 74,649,600,000
sqrt(74,649,600,000)  273,040.3 seconds.

But note: 273040.3 seconds is about 3.16 days, which matches our earlier calculation.

We'll do a few more:

- SS->QI: average = SS->OP + OP->RC + RC->QI = 172800 + 1209600 + 86400 = 1468800 seconds.
   stdev: sqrt(86400^2 + 259200^2 + 43200^2) = sqrt(7464960000 + 67184640000 + 1866240000) = sqrt(7464960000+67184640000+1866240000) = sqrt(76515840000)  276,614.6 seconds.

- OP->QI: average = OP->RC + RC->QI = 1209600 + 86400 = 1296000 seconds.
   stdev: sqrt(259200^2 + 43200^2) = sqrt(67184640000 + 1866240000) = sqrt(69050880000)  262,774.4 seconds.

- RC->PT: average = RC->QI + QI->CA + CA->PT = 86400 + 43200 + 259200 = 388800 seconds.
   stdev: sqrt(43200^2 + 21600^2 + 86400^2) = sqrt(1866240000 + 466560000 + 7464960000) = sqrt(1866240000+466560000+7464960000) = sqrt(9797760000)  98,984.6 seconds.

We can also consider pairs that are further apart, like SS->PT, SS->DT, etc.

But note: The problem says "a representative subset". We don't need to list every possible pair, but we should include enough to show the idea. Let's choose:

1. Consecutive pairs: (SS, OP), (OP, RC), (RC, QI), (QI, CA), (CA, PT), (PT, PK), (PK, WS), (WS, DT), (DT, AS).

2. Some non-consecutive pairs: (SS, RC), (SS, QI), (OP, QI), (RC, PT), (QI, PT), (CA, PK), (PT, WS), (PK, DT), (WS, AS), (SS, PT), (SS, DT), (SS, AS).

We'll compute the values for these.

Let's compute:

Consecutive:

1. ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 86400)  # 2 days, 1 day stdev
2. ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 259200)  # 14 days, 3 days stdev
3. ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200)  # 1 day, 0.5 day stdev
4. ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 21600)  # 0.5 day, 0.25 day stdev
5. ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 86400)  # 3 days, 1 day stdev
6. ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 17280)  # 0.5 day, 0.2 day stdev
7. ('PK', 'WS'): (8640, 4320)  # 0.1 day, 0.05 day stdev
8. ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 86400)  # 2 days, 1 day stdev
9. ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 864000)  # 30 days, 10 days stdev

Now non-consecutive:

10. ('SS', 'RC'): average = 172800 + 1209600 = 1382400, stdev = sqrt(86400^2 + 259200^2) = sqrt(7464960000 + 67184640000) = sqrt(74649600000)  273,040.3 seconds. Let's round to 273040.

11. ('SS', 'QI'): average = 172800 + 1209600 + 86400 = 1468800, stdev = sqrt(86400^2 + 259200^2 + 43200^2) = sqrt(7464960000 + 67184640000 + 1866240000) = sqrt(76515840000)  276,614.6 -> 276615.

12. ('OP', 'QI'): average = 1209600 + 86400 = 1296000, stdev = sqrt(259200^2 + 43200^2) = sqrt(67184640000 + 1866240000) = sqrt(69050880000)  262,774.4 -> 262774.

13. ('RC', 'PT'): average = 86400 + 43200 + 259200 = 388800, stdev = sqrt(43200^2 + 21600^2 + 86400^2) = sqrt(1866240000 + 466560000 + 7464960000) = sqrt(9797760000)  98,984.6 -> 98985.

14. ('QI', 'PT'): average = 43200 + 259200 = 302400, stdev = sqrt(21600^2 + 86400^2) = sqrt(466560000 + 7464960000) = sqrt(7931520000)  89,061.3 -> 89061.

15. ('CA', 'PK'): average = 259200 + 43200 = 302400, stdev = sqrt(86400^2 + 17280^2) = sqrt(7464960000 + 298598400) = sqrt(7763558400)  88,111.3 -> 88111.

16. ('PT', 'WS'): average = 43200 + 8640 = 51840, stdev = sqrt(17280^2 + 4320^2) = sqrt(298598400 + 18662400) = sqrt(317260800)  17,811.8 -> 17812.

17. ('PK', 'DT'): average = 8640 + 172800 = 181440, stdev = sqrt(4320^2 + 86400^2) = sqrt(18662400 + 7464960000) = sqrt(7483622400)  86,511.1 -> 86511.

18. ('WS', 'AS'): average = 172800 + 2592000 = 2764800, stdev = sqrt(86400^2 + 864000^2) = sqrt(7464960000 + 746496000000) = sqrt(753960960000)  868,310.0 -> 868310.

19. ('SS', 'PT'): average = SS->OP + OP->RC + RC->QI + QI->CA + CA->PT = 172800 + 1209600 + 86400 + 43200 + 259200 = 172800+1209600=1382400, +86400=1468800, +43200=1512000, +259200=1771200 seconds.
   stdev: sqrt(86400^2 + 259200^2 + 43200^2 + 21600^2 + 86400^2) = sqrt(7464960000 + 67184640000 + 1866240000 + 466560000 + 7464960000) = sqrt(7464960000+67184640000=74649600000, +1866240000=76515840000, +466560000=76982400000, +7464960000=84447360000) = sqrt(84447360000)  290,598.0 -> 290598.

20. ('SS', 'DT'): average = SS->OP + OP->RC + RC->QI + QI->CA + CA->PT + PT->PK + PK->WS + WS->DT = 172800 + 1209600 + 86400 + 43200 + 259200 + 43200 + 8640 + 172800 = let's calculate:
   172800 + 1209600 = 1382400
   +86400 = 1468800
   +43200 = 1512000
   +259200 = 1771200
   +43200 = 1814400
   +8640 = 1823040
   +172800 = 1995840 seconds.
   stdev: sqrt(86400^2 + 259200^2 + 43200^2 + 21600^2 + 86400^2 + 17280^2 + 4320^2 + 86400^2) 
   We'll compute the variance sum:
   86400^2 = 7,464,960,000
   259200^2 = 67,184,640,000
   43200^2 = 1,866,240,000
   21600^2 = 466,560,000
   86400^2 = 7,464,960,000
   17280^2 = 298,598,400
   4320^2 = 18,662,400
   86400^2 = 7,464,960,000
   Sum = 7,464,960,000 + 67,184,640,000 = 74,649,600,000
   +1,866,240,000 = 76,515,840,000
   +466,560,000 = 76,982,400,000
   +7,464,960,000 = 84,447,360,000
   +298,598,400 = 84,745,958,400
   +18,662,400 = 84,764,620,800
   +7,464,960,000 = 92,229,580,800
   sqrt(92,229,580,800)  303,694.5 -> 303695.

21. ('SS', 'AS'): average = SS->OP + OP->RC + RC->QI + QI->CA + CA->PT + PT->PK + PK->WS + WS->DT + DT->AS = 1995840 (from SS->DT) + 2592000 = 4587840 seconds.
   stdev: sqrt(variance(SS->DT) + variance(DT->AS)) but note: we already have the variance for SS->DT as 92,229,580,800 and variance for DT->AS = 864000^2 = 746,496,000,000.
   So total variance = 92,229,580,800 + 746,496,000,000 = 838,725,580,800.
   sqrt(838,725,580,800)  915,830.5 -> 915831.

We have 21 pairs. That should be enough.

Let's write the dictionary.

Note: We should use integers for seconds.

We'll create the dictionary with these pairs.

But note: The problem says "a representative subset", so we don't have to list every pair. We have 21 pairs, which is a good subset.

We'll output the dictionary.
