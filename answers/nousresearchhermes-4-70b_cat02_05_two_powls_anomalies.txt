Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what each POWL model represents and compare them to the standard Hire-to-Retire process. The standard process usually goes like this: Post job, screen candidates, interview, decide, onboard, add to payroll, close case. Sometimes, there might be loops or choices, but the core flow is pretty linear except for maybe an interview loop or conditional steps.

Starting with Model 1. Let me list out the nodes and their order. The nodes are Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close. The edges (order) are Post  Screen, Screen  Decide, Screen  Interview, Decide  Onboard, Onboard  Payroll, Payroll  Close. Wait, there's a problem here. In the standard process, after screening, you typically conduct interviews, then make a hiring decision. But in Model 1, Screen is followed by both Decide and Interview. That means after screening, the process can either decide or interview. That's not right because you can't make a hiring decision before conducting interviews. The interviews should come before the decision. So the edge from Screen to Decide here is an anomaly. It's a severe one because it skips a necessary step. Also, Interview is after Screen but there's no edge from Interview to Decide. So in this model, the decision could be made without conducting interviews, which is a major flaw. For example, the sequence could be Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close, which skips interviews altogether. That's definitely a problem.

Then, looking at the loop and choice structures. Model 1 doesn't have any loops or exclusive choices; it's a strict partial order with some parallelism. But the main issue is the incorrect ordering between Screen, Interview, and Decide.

Now, Model 2. Let's parse the nodes and structure. The nodes include Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding (which is a loop operator on Onboard and a silent transition), xor_payroll (an exclusive choice between Payroll and a silent transition), and Close. The edges are Post  Screen, Post  Interview, Interview  Decide, Decide  loop_onboarding, loop_onboarding  xor_payroll, xor_payroll  Close.

First, Post is connected to both Screen and Interview. That means after posting the job, you can screen candidates or interview in parallel? But Screening candidates usually comes after posting the job. However, starting interviews before screening might not make sense. Normally, you post the job, then screen candidates, then interview. So having Post lead to both Screen and Interview in parallel is an anomaly. Because Screening should come before Interviews. So this model allows for conducting interviews without first screening candidates, which is a deviation. But maybe in some cases, you might start scheduling interviews while screening is ongoing, but typically, you screen first. So this could be a less severe anomaly but still a deviation.

Next, after Interview comes Decide, which is correct. Then Decide leads to loop_onboarding. The loop_onboarding is a loop operator with Onboard and a silent transition. That means you can onboard the employee, then optionally repeat (since it's a loop), but the silent transition exits the loop. So this allows for repeating onboarding, which might be non-standard. Onboarding is usually a one-time process. Allowing multiple onboarding instances could be an issue. For example, the loop might run Onboard multiple times, which doesn't align with the standard process. So this loop is an anomaly.

Then, after loop_onboarding comes xor_payroll, which is an exclusive choice between Payroll and a skip. So after possibly looping onboarding, you can choose to add to payroll or skip it. Skipping payroll is a problem because once you've decided to hire and onboard, payroll must be added. So having a silent transition here allows skipping a critical step. That's a severe anomaly because it could lead to employees not being paid.

Comparing both models, Model 1's main issue is the incorrect order between Screen, Interview, and Decide, allowing a decision without interviews. Model 2's issues are allowing interviews before screening (parallel), a loop on onboarding, and skipping payroll. 

Between the two, Model 1 has a more severe anomaly because it skips a critical step (interview) before making a decision. Model 2's issues are more about optional steps and loops that might not be standard but don't entirely skip essential steps. However, the loop on onboarding and the option to skip payroll are also serious. But which model is closer to normative?

The normative process requires Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close. 

In Model 1, the order is Post  Screen  (Decide and Interview in parallel?), then Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close. But the edges are Screen  Decide and Screen  Interview. The Interview doesn't lead to Decide. So the process could go Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard... skipping Interview. That's a major flaw. So Model 1 is worse here.

In Model 2, the flow is Post  Screen and Interview in parallel, but then Interview  Decide. Wait, the edges are Post  Screen and Post  Interview. Then Interview  Decide. So the process could go Post  Interview  Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close. But Screen is also after Post. So maybe Screen and Interview can be in parallel. But in the standard process, you screen first, then interview. So allowing Interview to happen without Screen is a problem. However, in Model 2, after Post, both Screen and Interview can be executed, but the Decide comes after Interview. So if you do Interview first, then Decide, but Screen is still required as part of the process. Wait, no. Because Screen is a separate node. So the model allows for Post  Interview  Decide without involving Screen. That's a severe issue because Screening is skipped. So in Model 2, you can have a path where after Post, you do Interview, then Decide, then Onboarding, etc., without ever Screening. That's a major problem. So both models have severe issues.

Wait, Model 2's nodes are Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close. The edges are Post  Screen and Post  Interview. Then Interview  Decide. So the process could go Post  Interview  Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close, completely skipping Screen. That's a huge anomaly because you're making a hiring decision without screening candidates. So in Model 2, Screening is optional? Because Post leads to both Screen and Interview, but there's no edge from Screen to anything else except via the initial Post. So Screen could be skipped. For example, the path could be Post  Interview  Decide  ... which skips Screen. That's a critical error, as Screening is a necessary step before Interviews and Deciding.

So both models have severe anomalies. Model 1 allows Decide directly after Screen, skipping Interview. Model 2 allows skipping Screen entirely. Which is worse? Skipping Screening is a more severe issue because you can't interview candidates without first screening them. Screening is the step where you filter applicants, then interview the shortlisted ones. So if Model 2 allows skipping Screen, that's a bigger problem than Model 1's issue. 

Wait, but in Model 1, the edges are Screen  Interview and Screen  Decide. So after Screen, you can do Interview or Decide. But Interview is still a node in the model, so if you do Decide before Interview, you skip Interview. But in Model 2, Screen is a node that's not connected to the rest. Because Post leads to Screen and Interview. Then Interview leads to Decide. So Screen is a node that's not connected to any other nodes except via the initial Post. So in Model 2, after Post, you can do Screen or Interview. If you do Interview, then proceed to Decide, but Screen is not required. So the model allows a path where Screen is skipped. That's a major problem. 

So comparing the two, Model 2's anomaly (allowing skipping Screen) is more severe than Model 1's anomaly (allowing Decide before Interview). Because in the standard process, you must screen candidates before interviewing. So Model 2's flaw is more critical. 

But wait, in Model 1, after Screen, you can go to Decide before Interview. So the process could be Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close. That's a valid path in Model 1, which skips Interview. That's a major problem. So both models have severe issues. 

Which model is closer to normative? The normative process has Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close. 

Model 1's structure has Post  Screen  (Decide or Interview). If you take the path Screen  Interview  Decide, that's correct. But the model allows Screen  Decide directly. So it's partially correct but allows a wrong path. 

Model 2's structure allows Post  Interview  Decide, skipping Screen. So that's worse. 

Therefore, Model 1 has an anomaly that allows skipping Interview, while Model 2 allows skipping Screen. Skipping Screen is a more severe deviation because you can't interview without having screened candidates. So the more severe anomaly is in Model 2. 

But wait, in Model 2, after Post, you can do Screen and Interview in parallel. But the Decide is after Interview. So maybe the model requires that Interview is done, but Screen is optional. For example, Post leads to Screen and Interview. Then Interview leads to Decide. So if you do Post  Interview  Decide, you skipped Screen. So Screen is optional. That's a problem. 

In Model 1, the edges are Screen  Interview and Screen  Decide. So after Screen, you can choose to go to Interview or Decide. But in the normative process, after Screen, you must Interview, then Decide. So Model 1 allows skipping Interview, which is bad, but Model 2 allows skipping Screen, which is worse. 

So between the two, Model 2's anomaly is more severe. Therefore, Model 1 is closer to the normative process despite its flaw. 

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the partial order. In Model 1, the nodes are Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close. The edges are Post  Screen, Screen  Decide, Screen  Interview, Decide  Onboard, Onboard  Payroll, Payroll  Close. So the order allows for Screen to lead to both Decide and Interview. But there's no edge from Interview to Decide. So once you do Interview, there's no way to reach Decide unless you have an explicit edge. Wait, in Model 1, after Interview, how do you get to Decide? Because the edges from Screen are to Decide and Interview. So Interview is a node that's not connected to anything else. So once you do Interview, you can't proceed further. That's another problem. Because in the model, after Interview, there's no outgoing edge. So the process would get stuck at Interview. That's a deadlock. Because you have to do Interview, but Interview doesn't lead to any other node. So the only way to get to Decide is via Screen  Decide. So the model allows two paths: Post  Screen  Decide  ... which skips Interview, or Post  Screen  Interview, which deadlocks. So this model is invalid because it has a path that can't complete. That's a serious flaw. 

Wait, in Model 1, the nodes are Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close. The edges are:

Post  Screen

Screen  Decide

Screen  Interview

Decide  Onboard

Onboard  Payroll

Payroll  Close

So after Screen, you can go to Decide or Interview. If you go to Decide, then proceed to Onboard, etc. If you go to Interview, there's no edge from Interview to any other node. So once you do Interview, the process can't proceed further. That's a deadlock. So the process as modeled in Model 1 is incorrect because it allows for a path that cannot reach the end. Therefore, Model 1 is fundamentally broken, making it worse than Model 2. 

In Model 2, the nodes include loop_onboarding and xor_payroll. The edges are:

Post  Screen

Post  Interview

Interview  Decide

Decide  loop_onboarding

loop_onboarding  xor_payroll

xor_payroll  Close

So after Post, you can do Screen or Interview. But Screen isn't connected to anything else. So if you do Screen, there's no way to proceed. Because the next step after Screen would need to be connected, but in Model 2, the only edges from Post are to Screen and Interview. So if you take Post  Screen, then Screen has no outgoing edges. So that path deadlocks. That's another problem. So in Model 2, doing Screen doesn't lead anywhere, so the process can't complete. So the only valid path is Post  Interview  Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close. But that skips Screen. So Model 2 also has a deadlock if you take the Screen path. 

So both models have critical flaws. Model 1 allows a path that deadlocks (Screen  Interview) or skips Interview. Model 2 allows a path that deadlocks (Post  Screen) or skips Screen. 

This complicates the comparison. Which model is closer to normative? The standard process has Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close. 

In Model 1, if you take the path Post  Screen  Interview, you can't proceed. So the only way to complete is to go Post  Screen  Decide  ... which skips Interview. So the model forces you to skip Interview, making it non-compliant. 

In Model 2, the only way to complete is Post  Interview  Decide  ... which skips Screen. So both models are fundamentally flawed, but in different ways. 

However, the question asks which model more closely aligns with the normative version. Even though both have issues, perhaps one has a structure that can still represent part of the normative flow correctly, while the other cannot. 

In Model 1, if you ignore the possibility of deadlock and assume that Interview is connected to Decide (which it's not), but in reality, it's not. So the model is incorrect. 

In Model 2, the structure after Post allows for Interview to lead to Decide, which is correct, but Screen is optional. However, the loop and xor introduce other issues. 

Alternatively, maybe the partial order in Model 2 allows for both Screen and Interview to be done in parallel, but the normative process requires a sequence. However, in the standard process, you can't interview before screening. So allowing them in parallel is a deviation. 

But considering that Model 1's structure has a deadlock in a necessary path (if you try to do Interview after Screen), which makes the process invalid, while Model 2's structure allows a valid path (if you ignore Screen) but also has a deadlock if you take Screen. 

This is tricky. The question is which model is closer to normative. The normative process requires all steps: Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close. 

Model 1 includes all these steps but has incorrect ordering and a deadlock. Model 2 includes all steps but allows skipping some and has loops and choices that may not be correct. 

Wait, in Model 2, the nodes are Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding (which is Onboard with a loop), xor_payroll (Payroll or skip), and Close. So the steps Onboard and Payroll are present but modified with operators. 

The main issue in Model 1 is that after Screen, you can't reach Interview and then proceed. So the only way is to skip Interview. In Model 2, you can do the correct sequence if you ignore Screen (which is bad) but the model also allows for Screen to be done, but then it deadlocks. 

So perhaps Model 2's structure, despite its flaws, includes the correct sequence of Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close, but skips Screen. While Model 1 skips Interview. 

Between skipping Screen vs. skipping Interview, which is more critical? Screening is a necessary first step; you can't interview without having screened candidates. So skipping Screen is a more severe anomaly. Therefore, Model 2's anomaly is worse. 

But Model 1's anomaly is also severe. 

Alternatively, maybe the question considers which model has fewer or less severe anomalies. 

In Model 1, the main issue is that after Screen, you can go to Decide or Interview. If you go to Decide, you skip Interview. But if you go to Interview, you can't proceed. So the model requires you to skip Interview. That's a major flaw. 

In Model 2, the main issue is that after Post, you can go to Screen or Interview. If you go to Screen, you get stuck. If you go to Interview, you proceed correctly (Interview  Decide  ...). So the model allows a correct sequence if you follow Interview without Screen, but Screen is optional and causes a deadlock. 

But the standard process requires Screen. So Model 2's correct path skips Screen, which is invalid. 

Comparing the two, both have critical flaws, but which one is more aligned? 

Perhaps Model 1, despite its flaws, includes the correct order of Interview after Screen, but the model allows skipping it. Model 2's correct path skips Screen, which is more severe. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that neither is correct, but the question asks which is more normative. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that Model 1 is more normative because it at least includes the correct sequence (if followed), while Model 2's structure is more divergent. 

But I'm getting stuck. Let me recap.

Normative steps: Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close.

Model 1:

Edges:

Post  Screen

Screen  Decide

Screen  Interview

Decide  Onboard

Onboard  Payroll

Payroll  Close

So possible paths:

Path 1: Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close (skips Interview)

Path 2: Post  Screen  Interview (deadlock)

So only Path 1 is possible, which skips Interview. So the model enforces skipping Interview, which is a major flaw.

Model 2:

Edges:

Post  Screen

Post  Interview

Interview  Decide

Decide  loop_onboarding

loop_onboarding  xor_payroll

xor_payroll  Close

Nodes: Screen is connected only to Post. So if you do Screen, there's no way to proceed. So the only executable path is:

Post  Interview  Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close

Which skips Screen. But interviewing without screening is invalid. Also, the loop_onboarding allows multiple onboarding steps, which is non-standard. The xor_payroll allows skipping payroll, which is critical.

So Model 2's path skips Screen and allows skipping payroll, which are severe issues. 

Comparing the two, Model 1's enforced path skips Interview, while Model 2's path skips Screen and allows skipping payroll. 

In terms of severity, skipping Screening is more severe than skipping Interview. So Model 2's anomaly is worse. Therefore, Model 1 is closer to the normative process, even though it's also flawed. 

But wait, in Model 1, the only possible path is skipping Interview, which is a required step. So both models are fundamentally incorrect, but which one is less incorrect? 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that Model 1 is better because it at least includes the correct order of Onboard  Payroll  Close, while Model 2 introduces loops and skips payroll. 

Alternatively, the presence of the loop and xor in Model 2 introduces more anomalies beyond the normative process. 

I think the key is that in Model 1, the main issue is the order between Screen, Interview, and Decide, leading to skipping Interview. In Model 2, the issues are allowing Interviews before Screening, looping Onboarding, and skipping Payroll. 

Between the two, Model 1's anomaly is a single incorrect edge, while Model 2 has multiple deviations. But the deviation in Model 1 is more critical because it skips a necessary step (Interview), whereas Model 2's skips Screening, which is also necessary. 

This is really a tough call. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that Model 1 is more correct because it includes the correct sequence (if Interview is done after Screen, but the model doesn't enforce it), while Model 2 allows a completely incorrect path. 

But in reality, both models are incorrect. However, the question asks which is more normative. 

Another angle: the normative process has a fixed order. Model 1 allows some deviations (like skipping Interview) but includes all the necessary steps. Model 2 introduces optional steps and skips essential ones. 

But I'm not sure. 

In conclusion, after analyzing both models, Model 1's anomaly is allowing the decision to be made without interviews, which is a severe issue. Model 2's anomalies include allowing interviews without screening, looping onboarding, and skipping payroll. Both have severe issues, but skipping Screening (as in Model 2) is a more fundamental deviation from the normative process. Therefore, Model 1 is closer to the normative version despite its flaws.

**Analysis of POWL Models for Hire-to-Retire Process**

### **1. Anomalies in Model 1**
- **Key Deviations**:
  - **Incorrect Ordering**: The edge `Screen  Decide` allows a hiring decision to be made *before* conducting interviews. This skips a critical step, violating the standard sequence where interviews must precede decisions.
  - **Deadlock in Interview Path**: The edge `Screen  Interview` creates a deadlock because `Interview` has no outgoing edges. A valid execution path (`Post  Screen  Interview`) cannot proceed further, making the process incomplete.
- **Severity**: High. Skipping interviews fundamentally undermines the integrity of the hiring process. The deadlock further invalidates the model.

### **2. Anomalies in Model 2**
- **Key Deviations**:
  - **Parallel Screening and Interviews**: The edges `Post  Screen` and `Post  Interview` allow interviews to occur *before* screening candidates, which is illogical. Screening filters applicants before interviews.
  - **Loop on Onboarding**: The `loop_onboarding` operator permits repeating onboarding, which is atypical (onboarding is typically a one-time step).
  - **Skippable Payroll**: The `xor_payroll` operator allows skipping payroll via a silent transition, introducing a critical compliance risk (employees may not be paid).
  - **Deadlock in Screening Path**: The `Screen` node lacks outgoing edges, causing a deadlock if screening is performed.
- **Severity**: Severe. Skipping screening or payroll and enabling non-standard loops Are significant deviations.

### **3. Normative Alignment**
- **Model 1**:
  - **Strengths**: Includes all standard activities (`Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close`), but the forced skip of interviews undermines correctness. The deadlock in the interview path is a structural flaw.
  - **Weaknesses**: Mandatory exclusion of interviews in valid execution paths and deadlock.
- **Model 2**:
  - **Strengths**: Preserves the `Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close` sequence if screening is ignored, but this is non-normative.
  - **Weaknesses**: Allows skipping screening, loops onboarding, and skips payroll—all of which violate process integrity.

**Conclusion**: **Model 1 aligns more closely with the normative process**, despite its flaws. While it incorrectly allows skipping interviews, Model 2 introduces more severe deviations (e.g., skipping screening/payroll and non-standard loops). The normative process requires screening and interviews as sequential, mandatory steps; Model 1 partially preserves this sequence (if interviews are executed), whereas Model 2 entirely bypasses critical steps. However, neither model is fully correct, but Model 1 is less divergent overall. 

**Justification**: Skipping interviews (Model 1) is less severe than skipping screening/payroll (Model 2). Screening is foundational; interviews cannot occur without it. Model 2’s structural options (loops, skippable payroll) also deviate more significantly from standard practice.
