Here's a Python solution using the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module to parse the XML and the `networkx` and `pydot` libraries to visualize the BPMN model:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import networkx as nx
import pydot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def parse_xml(xml_string):
    """Parse the XML string into an ElementTree object"""
    return ET.fromstring(xml_string)

def create_graph(xml_tree):
    """Create a directed graph from the XML tree"""
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    
    # Find all sequence flows
    for sequence_flow in xml_tree.findall('.//sequenceFlow'):
        # Get the source and target IDs
        source_id = sequence_flow.find('sourceRef').attrib['id']
        target_id = sequence_flow.find('targetRef').attrib['id']
        
        # Add the edges to the graph
        G.add_edge(source_id, target_id)
    
    return G

def visualize_graph(G):
    """Visualize the graph using pydot and matplotlib"""
    dot = nx.drawing.nx_pydot.to_pydot(G)
    dot.write_dot('bpmn_dot.dot')
    dot = pydot.graph_from_dot_file('bpmn_dot.dot')[0]
    dot.write_png('bpmn.png')

def main():
    # Parse the XML string
    xml_string = """
    <definitions sid-f34b6fc9-80b2-419d-9c93-f6969f97e64f>
    ...
    </definitions>
    """
    xml_tree = parse_xml(xml_string)
    
    # Create a directed graph from the XML tree
    G = create_graph(xml_tree)
    
    # Visualize the graph
    visualize_graph(G)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code will create a directed graph from the XML tree and visualize it using pydot and matplotlib. The graph will be saved as a PNG file named "bpmn.png". 

To run this code, you'll need to have Python, `networkx`, `pydot`, and `matplotlib` installed. You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install networkx pydot matplotlib
```

Note that you'll also need to have the `graphviz` library installed on your system, as pydot uses it to render the graphs. You can install `graphviz` using your package manager (e.g. `apt-get`
