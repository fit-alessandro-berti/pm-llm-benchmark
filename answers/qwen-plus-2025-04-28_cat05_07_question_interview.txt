Okay, so I need to come up with a list of open-ended questions to understand the property onboarding process better. The user provided a detailed description, and I need to ask questions that uncover missing details, decision criteria, roles, timing, and exceptions.

First, I should break down the process into the main steps mentioned. Let me recall the steps: landlord contact, documentation review, assigning a property manager, meeting with the landlord, photographer and inspector visits, marketing, activation, tenant screening, lease setup, quality checks, and audits.

For each of these steps, I need to think about possible questions. For example, in the documentation phase, what if documents are missing? The interviewee might have to explain how they handle that. Also, when assigning the property manager, what factors are considered? Maybe the manager's experience with similar property types. 

Then, the meeting with the landlord—what happens if there are disagreements? Or if the landlord has special requirements. The inspector's role: what if they find issues, how are they resolved? 

Marketing part: how are the listings created, and what if the market trends change? Activation: how is the property activated, and what happens if there's a delay? 

Tenant screening: what's the process for checking credit, employment, references? If multiple tenants apply, how do they decide? Lease setup: what if the landlord wants custom clauses? 

Quality checks: what are the specific checks done by the compliance officer and financial analyst? How are exceptions handled, like special insurance or custom clauses?

Also, communication between stakeholders: how is this tracked, and what if there's a problem in the process? 

I need to make sure the questions are open-ended to get detailed answers. Avoid technical details, focus on understanding the process, decision criteria, roles, timing, and exceptions. Maybe also ask about the decision-making process when there are multiple options, or how the process is adjusted for different types of properties. 

Let me structure the questions by each phase. Maybe start with the initial contact, then documentation, manager assignment, meeting, inspections, marketing, activation, tenant screening, lease setup, audits, and exceptions. 

Check if I'm missing any parts. The user mentioned a compliance officer, financial analyst, IT department, etc. So questions about those roles and their responsibilities. Also, how are the timelines managed? For example, when does the property become active after marketing?

Need to ensure that the questions are not just yes/no but rather probing into the reasoning behind decisions. For example, "Why was the property manager chosen based on their experience with similar property types?" 

Also, think about potential exceptions: like if the landlord requires special insurance, how is that handled. Or if there are delays in inspections. 

I should also ask about the communication flow between different teams and how it's tracked. Maybe how the interviewee handles feedback from stakeholders.

Okay, compiling all these thoughts into a list of questions. Make sure they are clear, open-ended, and cover all aspects the user mentioned.
