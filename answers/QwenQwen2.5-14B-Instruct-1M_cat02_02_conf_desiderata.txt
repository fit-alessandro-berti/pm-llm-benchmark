### **1. Identifying Violations of Normative Rules:**

**Case 2:**
- **Violation:** The Credit Check was performed after the Risk Assessment (Credit Check at 08:20, Risk Assessment at 08:00). 
  - **Reason:** Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment, as per the normative constraint.
- **Consequence:** This violates the strict sequence requirement and invalidates the subsequent activities.

**Case 2:**
- **Violation:** Finalize Documentation was performed after the Loan Decision indicated a rejection (Finalize Documentation at 10:00, Loan Decision at 09:30).
  - **Reason:** Finalizing Documentation is only allowed if the loan is approved. Performing this step after a rejection is explicitly not allowed.
  - **Consequence:** This step is entirely out of sequence and contradicts the normative process flow.

### **2. Identifying Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions:**

**Case 3:**
- **Violation:** Credit Check took place more than 24 hours after the Application was received (Credit Check at 2024-01-14 10:00, Application Received at 2024-01-12 09:00).
  - **Reason:** It is recommended but not strictly required to complete the Credit Check within 24 hours of receiving the application. This is a desideratum condition.
  - **Consequence:** While not a serious violation, it represents suboptimal behavior that could impact timeliness and efficiency.

**Case 3:**
- **Violation:** Informing the Applicant happened more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision (Inform Applicant at 2024-01-16 15:00, Loan Decision at 2024-01-14 12:00).
  - **Reason:** It is recommended to inform the applicant within 48 hours after the Loan Decision. This is a desideratum condition.
  - **Consequence:** This delay could lead to unnecessary delays and potential customer dissatisfaction.

**Case 3:**
- **Violation:** No Follow-up Call was made before closing the case.
  - **Reason:** It is encouraged but not strictly required to perform a follow-up call before closing the case to ensure alignment with the applicant. This is a desideratum condition.
  - **Consequence:** This step, while not mandatory, is a best practice to ensure customer satisfaction and alignment.

### **3. Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors:**

**Case 2:**
- **Credit Check After Risk Assessment:** 
  - **Possible Justification:** If the Risk Assessment was initially conducted without the Credit Check, it suggests a procedural error or oversight. A potential workaround could be that the Credit Check results were reviewed post-assessment to validate the Risk Assessment. However, this is not compliant with the normative rules and should be corrected.

- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection:**
  - **Possible Justification:** This could be a human error or a miscommunication where the decision was thought to be an approval. However, this is a clear violation and should be corrected through a review process.

**Case 3:**
- **Delayed Credit Check:**
  - **Possible Justification:** Delays in processing might have been due to system issues or a high volume of cases. Implementing a more robust workflow management system could help in adhering to the desiderata.

- **Delayed Informing and Lack of Follow-up:**
  - **Possible Justification:** Delays in informing the applicant could be due to workload or resource constraints. Implementing a more efficient communication system or hiring additional staff could help meet the recommended timeline.

By identifying and addressing these violations and desiderata failures, the loan application process can be optimized for both compliance and efficiency.
