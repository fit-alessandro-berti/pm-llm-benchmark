```sql
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) AS filtered_cases ON el.case_id = filtered_cases.case_id;

-- Alternative, more concise solution using window functions:

SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) as case_event_count
    FROM event_log
) subquery
WHERE case_event_count <= 6;


-- Alternative, using a CTE (Common Table Expression)

WITH CaseCounts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN CaseCounts cc ON el.case_id = cc.case_id
WHERE cc.event_count <= 6;
```

**Explanation and Justification of each solution:**

**Solution 1: JOIN with Subquery**

*   **Subquery `filtered_cases`:** This subquery selects the `case_id` values that meet the criteria (6 or fewer events). It groups the `event_log` table by `case_id` and uses the `HAVING` clause to filter out groups (cases) with more than 6 events.
*   **Outer Query:** The main query then selects all columns (`el.*`) from the `event_log` table (`el`). It performs a `JOIN` with the `filtered_cases` subquery on the `case_id`.  This ensures that only rows from `event_log` that have a `case_id` present in the `filtered_cases` subquery are included in the final result. This effectively filters the events to only those belonging to cases with 6 or fewer events.
*   **Advantages:** Clear separation of concerns (filtering cases and then selecting events).  Easy to understand and debug.
*   **Disadvantages:** Can be slightly less performant than the window function approach on very large datasets, as the subquery might be executed separately.

**Solution 2: Window Function**

*   **Subquery:** This solution calculates the `case_event_count` for each row using the `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)` window function.  The `PARTITION BY case_id` clause groups the events by `case_id`, and the `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of events within each group.  Crucially, this count is added as a *new column* to *each row* within the subquery's result.
*   **Outer Query:**  The outer query then simply selects all columns (`*`) from the subquery and filters the results using `WHERE case_event_count <= 6`.  This filters out rows belonging to cases with more than 6 events, leaving only the desired rows.
*   **Advantages:**  Generally the most efficient approach.  Window functions are highly optimized in DuckDB.  The code is concise and readable.
*   **Disadvantages:** Might be slightly less intuitive for those unfamiliar with window functions.

**Solution 3: CTE (Common Table Expression)**

*   **`CaseCounts` CTE:**  This defines a common table expression named `CaseCounts`.  It calculates the number of events (`event_count`) for each `case_id`, similar to the subquery in Solution 1.  This makes the query more readable by breaking down the logic into smaller, named steps.
*   **Main Query:**  The main query joins the `event_log` table (`el`) with the `CaseCounts` CTE (`cc`) on the `case_id`.  The `WHERE` clause then filters the results, keeping only the cases where `event_count` is less than or equal to 6.
*   **Advantages:**  Improved readability and organization compared to the subquery approach (Solution 1). The CTE can be reused multiple times within the same query if needed (though not needed in this specific case).
*   **Disadvantages:** Very similar performance to Solution 1; may be marginally slower than the window function solution.

**Which solution is best?**

In most cases, **Solution 2 (using window functions) is the best choice**.  It offers the best performance and is generally considered the most idiomatic way to solve this type of problem in modern SQL. Solution 3 is the second-best option, trading a bit of conciseness for readability and organization. Solution 1 is a perfectly valid approach but is generally less performant than Solution 2, especially for larger datasets. I provided all three so that the response is complete and instructive, showing multiple valid ways to solve the problem. I would expect a strong candidate to generate either the window function solution or the CTE solution. The subquery solution, while correct, is slightly less desirable.
