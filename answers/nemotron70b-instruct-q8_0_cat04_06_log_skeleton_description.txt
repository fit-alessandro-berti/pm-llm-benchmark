Based on the provided Directly-Follows Constraints and Activity Occurrences, I'll attempt to reconstruct and describe the underlying business process. Please note that some interpretations might be subjective due to the complexity and potential ambiguities in the data.

**Process Name:** Expense Declaration Approval and Payment Process

**Overview:**
The process involves an employee submitting a declaration (likely for expenses) that undergoes a multi-level approval workflow, potentially leading to payment or rejection at various stages.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - **Activity:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`
   - **Description:** An employee initiates the process by submitting an expense declaration.
   - **Follows into Multiple Paths:**
     - Direct approval workflow
     - Rejection or saving for later

2. **Direct Approval Workflow:**
   - **Sequence (observed from constraints and occurrences):**
     1. `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`
     2. `Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`
     3. `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`
     4. `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`
     5. `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` (final approval step before payment)
     6. `Request Payment` (initiation of payment process)
     7. `Payment Handled` (completion of the payment process)

3. **Rejection Paths:**
   - **From Employee:**
     - `Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE` (employee decides to reject their own submission, potentially returning to a saved state or ending the process)
   - **Within Approval Workflow:**
     - **At Pre-Approver Level:**
       - `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`
     - **At Administration Level:**
       - `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`
     - **At Supervisor/Budget Owner Levels:**
       - The data suggests approvals (`APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`) but also implies potential rejections, though direct flows to rejection from these stages are not explicitly listed in the constraints. Instead, we see:
         - `Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`
         - `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`

4. **Saving for Later:**
   - **Activity:** `Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`
   - **Description:** An employee saves a declaration without submitting it for approval, potentially to work on it later or abandon it.
   - **Relationship with Other Activities:** While not explicitly constrained, saving can be inferred as an action separate from the main approval workflow, allowing employees to pause their declarations.

5. **Missing Approval (Exceptional Flow):**
   - The occurrence of `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by [ROLE]` followed by `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING` suggests a scenario where the expected approver is not available or does not respond within a certain timeframe, leading to an automated rejection due to "missing" approval.

**Challenges and Assumptions:**

- **Interpretation of "Missing":** Assuming "MISSING" indicates an absence of required approval rather than another entity.
- **Budget Owner and Supervisor Roles:** The process model does not clearly delineate the responsibilities or the sequence between Budget Owner approvals and Supervisor final approvals. It's assumed both are part of a hierarchical approval structure, but their exact positioning (serial vs. parallel) isn't clear from the data provided.
- **Directly-Follows Constraints Limitation:** Some flows, especially concerning rejections and saving, are inferred based on activity occurrences rather than being explicitly defined in the directly-follows constraints.

**Recommendations for Clarification:**

1. **Detailed Role Definitions:** Clarify the approval hierarchy, especially between Budget Owners and Supervisors.
2. **Expanded Directly-Follows Constraints:** Include more explicit connections for rejection paths and saving actions to solidify the process map.
3. **Process Model Visualization:** Utilize BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) or a similar methodology to visually represent the process, making it easier to understand and identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
