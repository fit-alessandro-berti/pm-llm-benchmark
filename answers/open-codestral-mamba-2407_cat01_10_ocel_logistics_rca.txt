From the data provided, here are some potential root causes for the performance issues in the process:

1. High frequency of "pick item" -> "pick item" events: This suggests that employees are picking items more frequently than they need to. This could be due to inefficient workflows or a lack of efficient storage solutions.

2. Long duration of "confirm order" -> "pay order" events: This indicates that the process of confirming and paying for orders is taking a long time. This could be due to complex workflows or a high volume of orders.

3. High frequency of "place order" -> "confirm order" events: This suggests that customers are placing orders and then immediately confirming them, without any delay. This could be due to a high volume of orders or a lack of human intervention in the order confirmation process.

4. High frequency of "create package" -> "send package" events: This suggests that packages are being created and sent immediately after creation, without any delay. This could be due to a high volume of packages or a lack of human intervention in the packaging process.

5. High frequency of "package delivered" -> "pay order" events: This suggests that customers are paying for their orders immediately after their packages are delivered, without any delay. This could be due to a high volume of orders or a lack of human intervention in the order payment process.

6. High frequency of "send package" -> "package delivered" events: This suggests that packages are being sent and then immediately delivered, without any delay. This could be due to a high volume of packages or a lack of human intervention in the package delivery process.

7. High frequency of "confirm order" -> "create package" events: This suggests that orders are being confirmed and then immediately packaged, without any delay. This could be due to a high volume of orders or a lack of human intervention in the order packing process.

8. High frequency of "confirm order" -> "pay order" events: This suggests that orders are being confirmed and then immediately paid for, without any delay. This could be due to a high volume of orders or a lack of human intervention in the order payment process.

9. High frequency of "package delivered" -> "payment reminder" events: This suggests that customers are receiving package delivery notifications and then immediately being reminded to pay for their orders, without any delay. This could be due to a high volume of orders or a lack of human intervention in the order payment process.

10. High frequency of "pay order" -> "pick item" events: This suggests that customers are paying for their orders and then immediately picking items, without any delay. This could be due to a high volume of orders or a lack of human intervention in the order processing process.

To address these performance issues, it may be necessary to reevaluate the workflows and processes in place, identify any inefficiencies, and implement changes to improve efficiency and reduce the frequency of certain events.
