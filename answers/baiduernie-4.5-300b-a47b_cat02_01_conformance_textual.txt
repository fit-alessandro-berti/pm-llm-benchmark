1. **Cases that violate the normative process**:
   - **Case 2**: Violates the expected sequence of activities.
   - **Case 3**: Violates the expected sequence of activities.
   - **Case 5**: Violates the expected sequence of activities.

2. **Explanation of violations**:
   - **Case 2**:
     - According to the normative description, after "Check inventory," if there is sufficient inventory, the process should first "Authorize payment," then "Package items," followed by "Ship order," and finally "Close order." However, in Case 2, the activity "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." This is a clear violation as "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items." Payment authorization must happen prior to packaging as it ensures the customer's payment method is valid and approved. Packaging items before authorization does not make logical sense in the context of the described process.
   - **Case 3**:
     - The normative description states that if the inventory is insufficient, after "Check inventory," the process should proceed to "Cancel order," and then "Close order" should follow. Any activities related to fulfillment, such as "Authorize payment" and "Ship order," should not occur after "Cancel order." In Case 3, after "Cancel order," the activity "Ship order" takes place. This is a significant violation since shipping an order after it has been canceled goes against the logical flow. Once an order is canceled, fulfillment - related activities should cease, and the next step should be to "Close order."
   - **Case 5**:
     - Based on the expected flow, when inventory is sufficient, the sequence should be "Check inventory," then "Authorize payment," followed by "Package items," "Ship order," and finally "Close order." In Case 5, the activity "Package items" is missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." This violates the rule that "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Shipping." Items must be prepared for shipment (package items) before they can be shipped, so the omission of this step disrupts the proper sequence of the fulfillment process.
