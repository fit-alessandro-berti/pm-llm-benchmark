This visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** that illustrates the "Dispatch of goods" process for a "Computer Hardware Shop".

The diagram is structured into a single **Pool** titled "Dispatch of goods, Computer Hardware Shop", which is further divided into three vertical **Swimlanes**, representing different departments or roles involved in the process:
1.  **Logistics**
2.  **Secretary** (implicitly part of the "Dispatch of goods" organization)
3.  **Warehouse**

Here's a detailed description of the process flow:

**1. Process Initiation and Parallel Paths:**
*   The process begins with the **Start Event** "Ship goods", which is initiated by the Secretary.
*   Immediately following, an **AND-split Gateway** (diamond with a plus sign) indicates that two parallel paths commence simultaneously: one handled by the Secretary and one by the Warehouse.

**2. Secretary's Path (Upper Flow):**
*   **Clarify Shipment Method:** The Secretary first performs the task "Clarify shipment method".
*   **Decision: Special Handling?** An **Exclusive Gateway** (diamond with an 'X') presents a decision point: "Special handling?".
    *   **If 'Yes' (Special Handling):**
        *   The Secretary performs "Get 3 offers from logistic companies".
        *   Then, they "Select logistic company and place order".
    *   **If 'No' (No Special Handling):**
        *   The Secretary "Check if insurance is required". This task uses "Customer information" (Data Store) and "Order details" (Data Object) as input/reference.
        *   This leads to an **Inclusive Gateway** (diamond with a circle).
            *   **Conditional Path (If Insurance Necessary):** If the check reveals "If insurance necessary" is true, the task "Insure parcel" is performed by the **Logistics** department.
            *   **Always Path:** Regardless of insurance, the Secretary "Write package label".
        *   Both the "Insure parcel" (if triggered) and "Write package label" paths converge into an **Exclusive Gateway** (diamond with an 'X').
*   **Merge Point:** The "Special handling" branch and the "Insurance/Label" branch both converge into this **Exclusive Gateway**, meaning only one of these overall administrative flows leads to the next synchronization point. This then leads to the final **AND-join Gateway**.

**3. Warehouse's Path (Lower Flow - Parallel):**
*   **Package Goods:** In parallel with the Secretary's activities, the Warehouse performs the task "Package goods".
*   **Delay Notification (Boundary Timer Event):** A **Timer Event** (circle with a clock icon) attached to the "Package goods" task indicates a potential delay. If "48 hours" pass before the task is complete, a separate task "Notify customer about delay" is triggered.
*   **Inclusive Gateway:** The completion of "Package goods" and the "Notify customer about delay" (if triggered) flow into an **Inclusive Gateway** (diamond with a circle). This means the process will continue once "Package goods" is done, and if the delay occurred, the notification path also flows through. This gateway then feeds into the final **AND-join Gateway**.

**4. Synchronization and Completion:**
*   **AND-join Gateway:** The process uses an **AND-join Gateway** (diamond with a plus sign) to synchronize the two main parallel branches (Secretary's administrative tasks and Warehouse's packaging tasks). Both paths must be completed before the process can proceed.
*   **Shipment Preparation:** Once synchronized, the Warehouse performs two final tasks:
    *   "Fill out Shipment paperwork".
    *   "Move package to pickup area".
*   **End Event:** The process concludes with the **End Event** "Shipment prepared".

In summary, the BPMN diagram effectively outlines the parallel activities, decision points, departmental responsibilities, and conditional flows involved in preparing a shipment of goods, from initial dispatch request to final preparation for pickup, including potential delays and insurance considerations.
