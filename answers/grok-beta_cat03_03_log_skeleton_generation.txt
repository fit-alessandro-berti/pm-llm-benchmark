Here is the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the described order fulfillment process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),  # If items are reserved, they are always picked.
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Invoice Customer'),  # Label must be generated before invoice for shipping info
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment'),  # Payment is recorded after the invoice is sent
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),  # QC must be done before packing
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),  # Dispatch might happen before or after IC, but IC must be after GSL
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('Check Availability', 'Generate Shipping Label'),  # GSL happens much later in the process
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Pick Items'),  # Payment processing happens post-picking
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'Receive Order': {1},  # Each order starts with one RO
        'Check Availability': {1},  # Each item in the order must be checked once
        'Reserve Items': {1},  # Items are reserved once per order
        'Pick Items': {1},  # Items are picked once
        'Quality Check': {1},  # Quality check is done once per order
        'Pack Order': {1},  # Order is packed once
        'Generate Shipping Label': {1},  # One label per shipment
        'Dispatch': {1},  # Order is dispatched once
        'Invoice Customer': {1},  # One invoice per order
        'Record Payment': {0, 1},  # Payment might not be recorded if payment fails or is delayed
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment'),
    }
}
```

This dictionary captures the constraints and logical flow of activities in the order fulfillment process:

- **Equivalence**: Picking must follow reserving items.
- **Always Before/After**: Ensures the correct sequence of operations.
- **Never Together**: Ensures that certain activities do not occur simultaneously, reflecting the process flow.
- **Activity Occurrences**: Limits how often each activity can occur in a case.
- **Directly-Follows**: Defines immediate successors to each activity. 

This structure helps in understanding and verifying the process flow, ensuring compliance with business rules, and can be used for process mining or conformance checking.
