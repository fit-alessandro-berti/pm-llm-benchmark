**Reasoning:**

1. **Timestamp Mismatches**: A timestamp tolerance of 2 seconds was applied, meaning events within this range were considered to be the same occurrence if no other clear discrepancies existed. For example, 'OrderReceived' in Log B (9:59:58) is within 2 seconds of 'Order Received' in Log A (10:00:00), so they are merged.

2. **Event Naming Variations**: Events with different names but the same functionality and order ID were matched. For instance, 'OrderReceived' in Log B matches 'Order Received' in Log A due to their similar nature and the absence of a more precise match.

3. **Attribute Integration**: When merging events, all available attributes from both logs were included. If one log provided additional detail (like user_id or resource_id), this was added to the merged record. For example, 'Order Validation' in Log B includes 'Cross-check inventory' under notes, which is included in the merged event.

4. **Handling Missing Events**: Some events are present only in one log and were kept as individual entries if no suitable match could be found within the timestamp tolerance. This includes the 'Quality Check' event from Log B, as there's no corresponding entry in Log A that can be definitively matched within the allowed deviation.

5. **Chronological Order**: The final list is ordered by ascending UTC timestamps to maintain a clear chronological sequence of events. In cases where multiple entries could be considered for the same time (due to the timestamp tolerance), the order preference was given to the event with more specific or detailed information, as per the principle that richer logs provide a more accurate representation of system activities.
