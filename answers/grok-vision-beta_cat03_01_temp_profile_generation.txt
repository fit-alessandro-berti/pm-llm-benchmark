Certainly! Let's create a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. The P2P process typically involves several steps including requisition, purchase order creation, goods receipt, and invoice processing, followed by payment. Here's how we might structure the temporal profile for such a process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Requisition', 'Purchase Order'): (24 * 3600, 4 * 3600),  # Average 1 day, stdev 4 hours
    ('Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'): (72 * 3600, 24 * 3600),  # Average 3 days, stdev 1 day
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): (48 * 3600, 12 * 3600),  # Average 2 days, stdev 12 hours
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment'): (96 * 3600, 24 * 3600),  # Average 4 days, stdev 1 day
    ('Requisition', 'Goods Receipt'): (96 * 3600, 48 * 3600),  # Average 4 days, stdev 2 days
    ('Requisition', 'Invoice Receipt'): (120 * 3600, 48 * 3600),  # Average 5 days, stdev 2 days
    ('Requisition', 'Payment'): (168 * 3600, 72 * 3600),  # Average 7 days, stdev 3 days
    ('Purchase Order', 'Invoice Receipt'): (72 * 3600, 24 * 3600),  # Average 3 days, stdev 1 day
    ('Purchase Order', 'Payment'): (120 * 3600, 48 * 3600),  # Average 5 days, stdev 2 days
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Payment'): (72 * 3600, 24 * 3600),  # Average 3 days, stdev 1 day
}
```

### Explanation:
- **('Requisition', 'Purchase Order')**: From the time a requisition is made to the time the purchase order is created, we assume it takes about 1 day on average with some flexibility (4 hours standard deviation).
- **('Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt')**: It might take 3 days on average to receive goods after the purchase order, with a standard deviation of 1 day due to logistics and shipping variances.
- **('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt')**: After receiving goods, it typically takes 2 days for the invoice to be processed, with a standard deviation of 12 hours, reflecting variability in administrative processing times.
- **('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment')**: Payment is processed 4 days after receiving the invoice, with a standard deviation of 1 day, considering payment terms and processing times.
- **Longer-term relationships**: Such as from 'Requisition' to 'Payment' (7 days average), include all intermediary steps, hence larger average and standard deviation.

This profile assumes a typical scenario but remember, real-world processes might vary widely due to different organizational structures, supplier reliability, payment terms, etc. Adjustments might be needed based on actual data from process logs or other sources.
