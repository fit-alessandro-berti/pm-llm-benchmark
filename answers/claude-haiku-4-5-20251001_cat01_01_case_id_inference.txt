# Case Grouping Analysis

Based on the sequence of activities, timing, department flow, and patient demographics, I can infer **three distinct cases**:

## **Case 1: 45-year-old Male with Leg Fracture**
**Events:** 1, 4, 7, 12, 15

| Event | Activity | Department | Details |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Register patient | ER | M, 45, private insurance |
| 4 | Initial triage | ER | Triage code 3 |
| 7 | X-ray imaging | Radiology | Left leg imaging |
| 12 | Doctor consultation | ER | Diagnosis: hairline fracture |
| 15 | Patient discharged | ER | Followup: outpatient clinic |

**Timeline:** 08:05:13  08:30:05 (25 minutes)  
**Patient Journey:** Registration  Triage  Imaging  Diagnosis  Discharge

## **Case 2: 62-year-old Female with Infection**
**Events:** 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17

| Event | Activity | Department | Details |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 2 | Register patient | ER | F, 62, public insurance |
| 5 | Initial triage | ER | Triage code 2 |
| 8 | Lab test requested | ER | Blood panel |
| 10 | Lab test completed | Laboratory | Normal levels |
| 11 | Doctor consultation | ER | Diagnosis: minor infection |
| 14 | Prescription created | ER | Antibiotics |
| 17 | Patient discharged | ER | Followup: pharmacy pickup |

**Timeline:** 08:07:02  08:35:29 (28 minutes)  
**Patient Journey:** Registration  Triage  Lab Request  Lab Results  Diagnosis  Prescription  Discharge

## **Case 3: 28-year-old Male with Scheduled Knee Surgery**
**Events:** 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

| Event | Activity | Department | Details |

| 9 | Surgery preparation | Surgery | General anesthesia prep |
| 13 | Surgery performed | Surgery | Arthroscopy procedure |
| 16 | Recovery room | Surgery | Stable condition |
| 18 | Patient discharged | Surgery | Followup: physiotherapy |

**Timeline:** 08:07:15  08:40:13 (33 minutes)  
**Patient Journey:** Registration  Consultation  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge

## **Grouping Logic**

1. **Patient Demographics** (age + gender) remain consistent within each case
2. **Department Consistency** - Cases follow logical department flows:
   - Case 1: ER  Radiology  ER
   - Case 2: ER  Laboratory  ER
   - Case 3: Surgery  Surgery (procedural pathway)
3. **Activity Sequence Logic** - Activities follow clinically logical orders
4. **Temporal Proximity** - Events within a case occur in tight clusters; interleaving occurs between different cases during parallel processing
