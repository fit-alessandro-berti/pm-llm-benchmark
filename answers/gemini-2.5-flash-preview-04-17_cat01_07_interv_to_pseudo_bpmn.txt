**Process Title:** Invoice Approval Process

**Goal:** To process received supplier invoices from reception to scheduling for payment.

**Participants (Pool/Lanes):**

*   **Pool:** Company
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable (AP Clerk - Mary)
    *   **Lane:** Purchasing (Purchasing Officer - Dan)
    *   **Lane:** Department Manager (Carlos)
    *   **Lane:** AP Supervisor (Rita)
    *   **Lane:** Shared Services / Escalation Handling (Involves AP Supervisor, Supplier Relationship Manager, sometimes AP/Purchasing)
*   **Pool:** Supplier

**Key Data Objects:**

*   Invoice
*   Purchase Order (PO)
*   Confirmation of Receipt/Details (from Purchasing)
*   System Log Entry

*   Resolved Issue Details

---

**Process Flow Description:**

1.  **Event: Invoice Received**
    *   **Trigger:** Invoice arrives (usually by email).
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable

2.  **Activity: Check Invoice for Valid PO Number**
    *   **Description:** AP Clerk examines the received invoice to see if it includes a valid Purchase Order number.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable
    *   **Output:** Invoice with/without identified PO.

3.  **Exclusive Gateway: PO Present?**
    *   **Description:** Decision point based on whether a valid PO was found on the invoice.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable
    *   **Flow:**
        *   `Yes` (Has valid PO) -> Go to Activity: Log Invoice in System.
        *   `No` (Missing valid PO) -> Go to Activity: Handle Missing PO (Return or Escalate).

4.  **Activity: Handle Missing PO (Return or Escalate)**
    *   **Description:** If the PO is missing or invalid, the AP Clerk typically returns the invoice to the supplier requesting the PO or more details. In some cases (less common/informal services), the AP Supervisor may handle it internally.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable (Primary), AP Supervisor (Escalation/Exception)
    *   **Output:** Request sent to Supplier OR internal handling initiated.
    *   **Flow:**
        *   `Primary Path (Return to Supplier)`: Send Invoice back to Supplier requesting PO. Process instance may end or wait for new, corrected invoice to enter process again. -> Go to **Event: Invoice Returned to Supplier**.
        *   `Exception Path (Internal Handling)`: Escalate to AP Supervisor for internal resolution of certain non-PO cases (as described by Rita). -> Go to Activity: Investigate and Resolve Invoice Issue (within Shared Services / Escalation Handling lane).

5.  **Event: Invoice Returned to Supplier**
    *   **Description:** The process instance for this specific received invoice ends, requiring supplier resubmission.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable (Effectively ends flow for *this* path).

6.  **Activity: Log Invoice in System**
    *   **Description:** AP Clerk enters the invoice details into the accounting system.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable
    *   **Input:** Invoice, PO number.
    *   **Output:** System Log Entry created.

7.  **Activity: Forward Invoice Details to Purchasing**
    *   **Description:** AP Clerk forwards relevant invoice and PO details (often via system notification or email) to the Purchasing department for confirmation.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable
    *   **Input:** System Log Entry/Invoice Details.

8.  **Activity: Review Invoice Against PO (Confirm Receipt/Details)**
    *   **Description:** Purchasing Officer reviews the invoice details against the Purchase Order to confirm goods/services were received and details (quantities, pricing) align.
    *   **Lane:** Purchasing
    *   **Input:** Invoice Details, PO details.
    *   **Output:** Confirmation or identification of discrepancy.

9.  **Exclusive Gateway: Purchasing Details Match PO?**
    *   **Description:** Decision point based on Purchasing's review outcome.
    *   **Lane:** Purchasing
    *   **Flow:**
        *   `Yes` (Details match) -> Go to Activity: Send Confirmation to Accounts Payable.
        *   `No` (Discrepancy found) -> Go to Activity: Initiate Discrepancy Clarification (Purchasing).

10. **Activity: Send Confirmation to Accounts Payable**
    *   **Description:** Purchasing informs AP that the invoice details align with the PO and receipt is confirmed.
    *   **Lane:** Purchasing
    *   **Output:** Confirmation signal/data object.

11. **Activity: Initiate Discrepancy Clarification (Purchasing)**
    *   **Description:** Purchasing identifies an issue and starts the process of clarifying it, potentially asking AP to hold the invoice or contacting the supplier (possibly via Supplier Relations).
    *   **Lane:** Purchasing
    *   **Output:** Discrepancy flagged, clarification process begins.
    *   **Flow:** -> Go to Activity: Investigate and Resolve Invoice Issue (within Shared Services / Escalation Handling lane).

12. **Activity: Match Invoice Line Items to PO in System**
    *   **Description:** AP Clerk uses the system to perform a formal 3-way match (Invoice, PO, Receipt Confirmation). This step typically follows successful confirmation from Purchasing or resolution of previous issues.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable
    *   **Input:** Invoice, PO, Purchasing Confirmation/Resolved Issue Details.
    *   **Output:** System Match Result.

13. **Exclusive Gateway: System Match Successful?**
    *   **Description:** Decision point based on the automated/system-assisted match result.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable
    *   **Flow:**
        *   `Yes` (Match successful) -> Go to Activity: Send Invoice for Manager Approval.
        *   `No` (Match failed - discrepancy found) -> Go to Activity: Initiate Discrepancy Resolution (AP Lead).

14. **Activity: Initiate Discrepancy Resolution (AP Lead)**
    *   **Description:** AP Clerk identifies a system match failure and initiates the process to resolve it, typically by contacting Purchasing or escalating to the AP Supervisor.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable
    *   **Output:** Discrepancy flagged, resolution process begins.
    *   **Flow:** -> Go to Activity: Investigate and Resolve Invoice Issue (within Shared Services / Escalation Handling lane).

15. **Activity: Investigate and Resolve Invoice Issue**
    *   **Description:** This is a complex activity often handled by the AP Supervisor, potentially involving the Supplier Relationship Manager (to contact the supplier), Purchasing, or coordinating between departments. It addresses discrepancies identified at various stages (Purchasing review, AP system match) and handles certain non-PO cases.
    *   **Lane:** Shared Services / Escalation Handling (Led by AP Supervisor, involves others).
    *   **Input:** Flagged discrepancy details, Invoice, PO.
    *   **Output:** Issue status (Resolved or Unresolvable).

16. **Exclusive Gateway: Issue Resolved?**
    *   **Description:** Decision point based on the outcome of the investigation and resolution effort.
    *   **Lane:** Shared Services / Escalation Handling
    *   **Flow:**
        *   `Yes` (Issue successfully resolved) -> Go to Activity: Send Invoice for Manager Approval. (Issues resolved at this stage typically allow the invoice to proceed to the next validation point, which is manager approval after reconciliation).
        *   `No` (Issue cannot be resolved / Requires Rejection) -> Go to Activity: Reject Invoice.

17. **Activity: Send Invoice for Manager Approval**
    *   **Description:** The system notifies the relevant Department Manager that an invoice is ready for their final approval. This occurs after successful matching or resolution of previous issues.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable (System Triggered)
    *   **Input:** Invoice details, PO details, Purchasing Confirmation, successful Match/Resolution confirmation.

18. **Activity: Review and Approve Invoice**
    *   **Description:** The Department Manager reviews the invoice details, PO, and confirmations in the system and makes an approval decision.
    *   **Lane:** Department Manager
    *   **Input:** Invoice details, supporting documentation/status.
    *   **Output:** Approval decision (Approved or Rejected).

19. **Exclusive Gateway: Invoice Approved?**
    *   **Description:** Decision point based on the Department Manager's decision.
    *   **Lane:** Department Manager
    *   **Flow:**
        *   `Yes` (Approved) -> Go to Activity: Send Approval Confirmation to AP.
        *   `No` (Rejected) -> Go to Activity: Notify AP of Rejection/Request Investigation.

20. **Activity: Send Approval Confirmation to AP**
    *   **Description:** The system records the manager's approval and notifies Accounts Payable.
    *   **Lane:** Department Manager (System Triggered)
    *   **Output:** Approval confirmation signal/data object.

21. **Activity: Schedule Invoice for Payment**
    *   **Description:** Accounts Payable receives the final approval and schedules the invoice to be included in an upcoming payment run.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable
    *   **Input:** Approved Invoice.

22. **Event: Invoice Scheduled for Payment**
    *   **Description:** The standard successful process flow concludes with the invoice being ready for payment.
    *   **Lane:** Accounts Payable
    *   **Type:** End Event

23. **Activity: Notify AP of Rejection/Request Investigation**
    *   **Description:** The Department Manager rejects the invoice and informs AP, often requesting further investigation.
    *   **Lane:** Department Manager (System/Communication)
    *   **Output:** Rejection notification, request for investigation.
    *   **Flow:** -> Go to Activity: Investigate and Resolve Invoice Issue (within Shared Services / Escalation Handling lane). (Rejected invoices need investigation to resolve the reason for rejection before potentially being re-submitted for approval).

24. **Activity: Reject Invoice**
    *   **Description:** Formal step to reject the invoice. This path is taken when an issue cannot be resolved internally or with the supplier.
    *   **Lane:** Shared Services / Escalation Handling (Result of unresolved issue)
    *   **Input:** Unresolvable Issue Details.
    *   **Output:** Formal rejection status.

25. **Event: Invoice Rejected**
    *   **Description:** An alternate end point for the process instance when the invoice cannot be approved after investigation.
    *   **Lane:** Shared Services / Escalation Handling
    *   **Type:** End Event

**Notes on Ambiguities/Variations:**

*   The exact point where Rita/Supervisor takes over resolution can vary (after AP match failure, after Purchasing discrepancy, after Manager rejection). The model consolidates these into a single 'Investigate and Resolve Invoice Issue' activity and lane.
*   The handling of non-PO invoices has variations: Mary sends back to the supplier initially, but Rita handles internal resolution for certain cases. The model shows these as distinct paths from the initial PO check gateway.
*   The return path after discrepancy resolution or manager rejection is modeled to flow back to the "Send Invoice for Manager Approval" step. This aligns with statements that issues are resolved *before* manager approval and that problem invoices return to the "normal flow: ... approval".
*   The level of detail in 'Investigate and Resolve Invoice Issue' is high-level, as the interviews mention various actions (contacting suppliers, coordinating internally) but not a fixed sub-process.
