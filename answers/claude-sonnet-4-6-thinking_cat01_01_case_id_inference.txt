## Case Grouping Analysis

### Methodology
I used **patient age + gender + department + logical activity flow** as the primary grouping keys, since no explicit case ID exists. Three distinct patient profiles emerge immediately from the data.

## Identified Cases

###  Case 1 — Male, Age 45 | ER Visit (Hairline Fracture)

| # | Timestamp | Activity | Department | Key Info |
|---|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| 1 | 08:05:13 | Register patient | ER | insurance=private |
| 4 | 08:10:50 | Initial triage | ER | triage_code=3 |
| 7 | 08:15:42 | X-ray imaging | Radiology | body_part=left_leg |
| 12 | 08:23:10 | Doctor consultation | ER | diagnosis=hairline_fracture |
| 15 | 08:30:05 | Patient discharged | ER | followup=outpatient_clinic |

**Logic:** Registration  Triage  Imaging (left leg)  Diagnosis consistent with fracture  Discharge. Clean linear ER flow.

###  Case 2 — Female, Age 62 | ER Visit (Minor Infection)

| # | Timestamp | Activity | Department | Key Info |
|---|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| 2 | 08:07:02 | Register patient | ER | insurance=public |
| 5 | 08:12:29 | Initial triage | ER | triage_code=2 |
| 8 | 08:16:10 | Lab test requested | ER | test_type=blood_panel |
| 10 | 08:20:27 | Lab test completed | Laboratory | results=normal_levels |
| 11 | 08:22:54 | Doctor consultation | ER | diagnosis=minor_infection |
| 14 | 08:27:00 | Prescription created | ER | medication=antibiotics |
| 17 | 08:35:29 | Patient discharged | ER | followup=pharmacy_pickup |

**Logic:** Registration  Triage  Blood test ordered/completed  Consultation  Antibiotics prescribed  Discharge with pharmacy instruction. Coherent infection workup flow.

###  Case 3 — Male, Age 28 | Surgery (Scheduled Knee Surgery)

| # | Timestamp | Activity | Department | Key Info |
|---|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| 3 | 08:07:15 | Register patient | Surgery | insurance=private |
| 6 | 08:13:00 | Doctor consultation | Surgery | reason=scheduled_knee_surgery |
| 9 | 08:16:45 | Surgery preparation | Surgery | prep_type=general_anesthesia |
| 13 | 08:25:19 | Surgery performed | Surgery | procedure=arthroscopy |
| 16 | 08:31:37 | Recovery room | Surgery | condition=stable |
| 18 | 08:40:13 | Patient discharged | Surgery | followup=physiotherapy_sessions |

**Logic:** Pre-planned surgical admission  Pre-op consult  Anesthesia prep  Arthroscopy  Recovery  Discharge with physio. Textbook elective surgery flow.

## Summary Table

```
Event #    Case

1, 4, 7, 12, 15        Case 1 (45M, ER)
2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17    Case 2 (62F, ER)
3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18    Case 3 (28M, Surgery)
```

The key discriminators were: **(1)** unique age+gender combinations, **(2)** consistent department routing, and **(3)** medically coherent activity sequences within each group.
