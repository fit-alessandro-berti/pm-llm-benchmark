Based on a comparison of the two event logs, **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits the source of the bias**, specifically in the form of preferential treatment that disadvantages Group A (Protected Group).

Here is the detailed analysis of how this bias manifests and the specific role of the data attributes.

### 1. Identification of Bias: The "Inverted Merit" Anomaly
The most distinct evidence of bias is found by comparing **Case P002** (Group A) against **Case U003** (Group B).

*   **Case P002 (Group A):**
    *   **Preliminary Score:** 710
    *   **Adjustment:** 0
    *   **Final Decision:** **Rejected**
    *   *Inference:* For Group A, a score of 710 is insufficient for approval. The approval threshold for this group appears to be 720 (based on Case P001).

*   **Case U003 (Group B):**
    *   **Preliminary Score:** 695
    *   **Adjustment:** +10 (Community Boost)
    *   **Final Adjusted Score:** 705
    *   **Final Decision:** **Approved**

**The Bias Manifestation:**
Case U003 was approved with a final score (705) that is **lower** than the score of Case P002 (710), who was rejected. This indicates a systematic bias where the rules engine applies a more lenient standard to Group B or allows the "Community Boost" to override standard risk thresholds.

### 2. The Influence of Attributes

The bias is constructed through a chain of dependencies involving three specific columns:

#### A. `LocalResident` (The Gatekeeper Variable)
*   **Group A:** All entries are `FALSE`.
*   **Group B:** All entries are `TRUE`.
*   **Impact:** This attribute acts as a proxy for exclusion. Because Group A members are not local residents, they appear ineligible to join the specific organizations that trigger score boosts. Systematic exclusion from "Residency" ensures they cannot access the benefits given to Group B.

#### B. `CommunityGroup` (The Bias Trigger)
*   **Group A:** Always `None`.
*   **Group B:** Includes members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club."
*   **Impact:** This attribute creates a "tiered" system of applicants. The system values social affiliation (membership in a Darts Club) over raw merit.
    *   In Case **U001**, the applicant had the same raw score (720) as **P001**. However, because of their group membership, U001 was boosted to 730, putting them in a "safer" bracket, whereas P001 was approved but sat exactly on the threshold.

#### C. `ScoreAdjustment` (The Mechanism of Action)
*   **Group A:** No adjustments (`0` or `N/A`).
*   **Group B:** Receives a `+10 (Community Boost)` when a Community Group is present.
*   **Impact:** This is the algorithmic implementation of the bias. It artificially inflates the creditworthiness of Group B.
    *   Crucially, in **Case U003**, this adjustment salvaged a sub-par application. A raw score of 695 would likely have been rejected instantly in Group A (since 710 was rejected). The adjustment allowed a high-risk candidate in the Unprotected Group to pass, while a lower-risk candidate in the Protected Group (P002) was denied.

### 3. Conclusion on Systematic Differences

The system displays **Disparate Impact** and **Disparate Treatment**:

1.  **Standardization Failure:** The "Rules Engine" does not apply a universal standard. Group A is judged strictly on `PreliminaryScore`. Group B is judged on `PreliminaryScore + Social Capital`.
2.  **Threshold Shifting:** The logs suggest that being a `LocalResident` with a `CommunityGroup` effectively lowers the approval bar. The system denied a score of 710 for the Protected Group but approved a score of 705 for the Unprotected Group.

**Summary:** The bias is located in the logic that awards the `ScoreAdjustment`. By tying creditworthiness to `CommunityGroup` membership (which correlates perfectly with `LocalResident`), the system systematically privileges Group B, allowing them to be approved with lower objective qualifications than Group A.
