What the picture shows

•  What is on each axis  
  – Horizontal axis (bottom): real calendar time, running from 25-Jan-2000 on the left to 24-Apr-2013 on the right.  
  – Vertical axis: the three activities that can occur in a traffic-fine process.  
       • top line= “Send Fine”  
       • middle line = “Insert Fine Notification”  
       • bottom line = “Send for Credit Collection”

•  What the lines mean  
   Every individual case (i.e. every fine that was issued) is drawn as a poly-line that connects, in time order, the points at which that case executed the three activities.  
   – Grey vertical segments run between “Send Fine” and “Insert Fine Notification”.  
     They are virtually vertical because those two steps happen almost immediately after one another for nearly every case.  
   – Pink / red diagonal segments run from “Insert Fine Notification” down to “Send for Credit Collection”.  
     The slope of the line reflects the waiting time: a steep line means the case was forwarded quickly; a flatter line means it took longer.  
     The darker the red, the more cases are overlapping along exactly the same trajectory.

What you can read from it

1.  Volume: thousands of fines were issued over the 13-year period (dense block of grey lines at the top).  
2.  Immediate notification: almost every grey line is perfectly vertical, showing that “Insert Fine Notification” follows “Send Fine” with negligible delay.  
3.  Escalation to credit collection is far less uniform: only a subset of cases continue to the bottom activity and they do so after highly variable delays (the red fan-shaped bundles).  
4.  Batch behaviour: the red fans start from a single point on the middle line, indicating that on certain calendar days many fines were inserted at once and then trickled to credit collection over different time spans.  
5.  Periods of activity: some parts of the timeline (e.g., early 2000, 2006–2007, 2012–2013) have noticeably denser fans, hinting at higher issuance volumes or stricter follow-up during those periods.

In short, the visualisation is a time-line plot of every case in a traffic-fine event log, showing that fine notifications are sent immediately after the fine is issued, whereas forwarding the unpaid fine to a credit-collection agency occurs only for some cases and after widely varying waiting times.
