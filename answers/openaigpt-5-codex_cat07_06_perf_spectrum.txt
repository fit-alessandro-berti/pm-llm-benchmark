The graphic is a timeoriented “storyline” of individual fines.  
The horizontal axis spans roughly 2000 to 2013, while the vertical axis lists the three activities in the process:

* top line – **Send Fine**  
* middle line – **Insert Fine Notification**  
* bottom line – **Send for Credit Collection**

Each thin strand corresponds to a single case. A strand connects the events that happened in that case, plotting the time of each event on the horizontal axis.  

Key observations:

* The dense thicket of almost vertical gray lines between “Insert Fine Notification” and “Send Fine” shows that, for most cases, the fine is sent almost immediately after the notification is created, and this happens continuously throughout the entire period.
* Only a subset of cases (drawn in pink/red) proceed to “Send for Credit Collection.” These strands originate near the middle line and plunge down to the bottom line, often with a noticeable time lag (slanted segments) before the credit-collection step. The occurrences of this escalation appear in batches throughout the timeline.
* Overall event volume increases slightly toward the later years, but the pattern of fast notificationtofine issuance and occasional escalation to credit collection remains consistent.

Thus, the visualization emphasizes the frequency and timing of transitions between activities in the fine management process over a 13-year span.
