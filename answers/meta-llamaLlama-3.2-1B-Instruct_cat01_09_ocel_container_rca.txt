After analyzing the event log, I've identified several root causes for performance issues in the process. Here are my findings:

1. **High frequency and large number of events for object type "Truck"**: The frequency and number of events for "Truck" objects are extremely high, with 8559 events for a single object. This may indicate that the system is not handling the events correctly, leading to high processing times.
2. **Circular dependencies between object types**: There are several circular dependencies between object types, such as "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck", which can lead to high processing times and low throughput.
3. **Over-sequential execution of events**: Some events, like "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" (frequency 1673), are executed immediately after the previous event, while others, like "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" (frequency 8559), have delayed execution. This can lead to high CPU utilization and low performance.
4. **Insufficient locking of resources**: Some events, like "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" (frequency 1673), may not be able to access the resources allocated to the object type "Load Truck", leading to contention and performance issues.
5. **Inefficient usage of database indexes**: The database index on the "object_type" field may not be being utilized efficiently, leading to slower query execution times.
6. **High number of identical events**: The number of identical events, such as "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" (frequency 8559), may indicate that the system is not performing efficient data aggregation or analysis.

To address these issues, I recommend the following:

1. **Optimize event scheduling**: Use event scheduling algorithms to minimize circular dependencies and optimize event execution order.
2. **Implement caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the database and improve query performance.
3. **Use efficient database indexes**: Use database indexes to improve query performance and reduce contention.
4. **Simplify event dependencies**: Simplify event dependencies to reduce the number of conditional checks and improve execution efficiency.
5. **Consider parallel processing**: Consider parallel processing techniques to take advantage of multi-core processors and improve overall system performance.

By addressing these issues, you should be able to improve the performance of the process and reduce the load on the system.
