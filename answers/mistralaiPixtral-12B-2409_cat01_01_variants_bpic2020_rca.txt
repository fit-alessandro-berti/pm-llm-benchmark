Based on the provided process variants and their performances, here are some process and data-specific considerations that could be root causes for the performance issues:

1. **Rejections and Resubmissions**:
   - Many process variants involve rejections and subsequent resubmissions, which can significantly increase the process time and cost. For instance:
     - The variant with the highest performance (4) has multiple rejections and resubmissions, resulting in a high performance of 9,110,508.
     - The variant with the second-highest performance (5) also involves multiple rejections and resubmissions, with a performance of 3,502,608.
   - To improve performance, consider reducing the number of rejections and streamlining the resubmission process.

2. **Additional Approval Steps**:
   - Process variants with additional approval steps tend to have higher performances. For example:
     - The variant with the third-highest performance (6) involves an additional budget owner approval, resulting in a performance of 2,790,977.
     - The variant with the fourth-highest performance (7) involves a pre-approver, leading to a performance of 2,544,294.
   - To improve performance, consider minimizing the number of approval steps, unless additional approvals are necessary for control or compliance reasons.

3. **Missing Data or Information**:
   - Some variants involve rejections due to missing data or information, leading to additional processing time. For instance:
     - The variant with a performance of 1,947,246 involves a rejection due to missing data.
     - The variant with a performance of 872,310 also involves a rejection due to missing data.
   - To improve performance, ensure that all required data is collected upfront, and consider implementing automated data validation checks.

4. **Inefficient Process Design**:
   - Some process variants suggest that the process design could be improved. For example:
     - The variant with a performance of 1,685,420 involves unnecessary rejections and approvals, indicating that the process could be streamlined.
   - To improve performance, regularly review and optimize process designs to eliminate inefficiencies.

5. **High Frequency Variants**:
   - Some process variants have high frequencies but relatively lower performances. For instance:
     - The variant with a frequency of 4,618 has a performance of 810,187.903.
     - The variant with a frequency of 1,392 has a performance of 854,633.975.
   - To improve overall performance, consider focusing on optimizing these high-frequency variants.

By addressing these process and data-specific considerations, you can help improve the overall performance of the process.
