Based on the provided process variants and their performances, here are some process and data-specific considerations that could be root causes for the performance issues:

1. **Rejections and Resubmissions:**
   - Many variants involve rejections and subsequent resubmissions, which can significantly increase processing time and cost. For example:
     - "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" with a frequency of 5 and performance of 13,805,869.200.
     - "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" appears multiple times in various variants, indicating a common issue with initial submissions.
   - *Root Cause:* The initial submission process may have issues, leading to frequent rejections and resubmissions.

2. **Multiple Approvals:**
   - Some variants require multiple approvals, which can increase processing time. For instance:
     - "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" appears in several variants, increasing the number of approval steps.
   - *Root Cause:* The process may have complex approval hierarchies that slow down processing.

3. **Final Approval Delays:**
   - Variants involving "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" often have high performance values, suggesting delays at this stage. For example:
     - "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" with a frequency of 4618 and performance of 810,187.903.
   - *Root Cause:* Supervisors may have a backlog or other priorities, leading to delays in final approval.

4. **Data Inconsistencies or Missing Information:**
   - Variants involving "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" or "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" suggest data-related issues. For example:
     - "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" with a frequency of 40 and performance of 1,947,246.400.
   - *Root Cause:* Data inconsistencies or missing information may lead to rejections and additional processing steps.

5. **Inefficient Process Design:**
   - Some variants suggest inefficient process design, such as:
     - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" with a frequency of 77 and performance of 1,728,631.623.
   - *Root Cause:* The process may have unnecessary steps or approvals that can be streamlined or automated.

To address these performance issues, consider the following:

- Review and optimize the initial submission process to reduce rejections.
- Streamline complex approval hierarchies and consider implementing automated approvals where possible.
- Investigate and address data inconsistencies or missing information.
- Evaluate and optimize the process design to eliminate unnecessary steps and approvals.
- Monitor and manage supervisors' workloads to prevent delays in final approvals.
