### Discovered Process Tree

The process tree below captures the main sequential flow of the business process (starting with application receipt, followed by validation and assessment, then optional handling of missing information via a loop, and finally approval, confirmation, and archival). It balances fitness (covers all observed traces), precision (avoids overgeneralization by structuring the loop specifically around missing info requests and re-validations), and simplicity (uses minimal nested operators).

The structure is:

```
-> (
    'Receive Application (RA)',
    -> (
        'Validate Form (VF)',
        -> (
            'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
            * (
                'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
                'Validate Form (VF)'
            )
        )
    ),
    -> (
        'Approval Decision (AD)',
        -> (
            'Send Confirmation (SC)',
            'Archive Case (AC)'
        )
    )
)
```

#### Explanation
- **Overall Structure**: The root is a sequence (`->`) enforcing the linear progression: initial setup  eligibility check and optional loop  finalization.
- **Initial Setup**: Sequence of `'Receive Application (RA)'`  `'Validate Form (VF)'`, which occurs in all cases.
- **Eligibility Check and Loop**: After initial validation, `'Assess Eligibility (AE)'` leads into a loop (`*`):
  - The loop body is `'Request Missing Info (RMI)'` (do-part, which can repeat 0+ times, matching cases with 0, 1, or 2 requests).
  - After each RMI (or directly if no loop), `'Validate Form (VF)'` (redo-part) re-validates, but the loop can exit after any iteration (or not enter at all).
  - This precisely models the observed repetitions (e.g., in Case 1: one RMI + VF; Case 3: two RMI + one final VF; Case 2: no loop).
- **Finalization**: A sequence (`->`) of `'Approval Decision (AD)'`  `'Send Confirmation (SC)'`  `'Archive Case (AC)'`, which follows the loop in all cases.
- **Key Properties**:
  - **Fitness**: All traces fit (e.g., Case 2 skips the loop entirely; Cases 1 and 3 execute it 1–2 times).
  - **Precision**: The loop is targeted at RMI and re-VF, preventing invalid traces like arbitrary activity interleaving.
  - **Simplicity**: Minimal depth (3 levels of nesting), no unnecessary XOR or parallel branches, as no choices or concurrency are observed.

This tree can be directly constructed using the provided `ProcessTree` API by nesting operators and leaves accordingly.
