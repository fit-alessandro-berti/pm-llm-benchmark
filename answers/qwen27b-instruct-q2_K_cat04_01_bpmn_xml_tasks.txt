To provide an accurate response, I would need to know the specifics about the structure and content of your BPMN diagram. However, based solely on the provided XML snippet without extra details regarding task IDs or names:

Given the context provided within the XML snippet you've given (`bpmn:process` tag), it seems like this is a process model representing workflow activities in an orchestration diagram typically found in Business Process Management Systems tools such as BPMN diagrams generated by software like Bizagi.

Each `bpmn:sequenceFlow` attribute describes transitions between tasks in the process flow:

- The sequence flows describe possible paths through the process, including:
    * Task (sourceRef="ide78b8ded-70fd-43fc-9699-acee5a4f095a") to `iddbfcda1a-fe29-4119-a63f-7f66c7b4526b`
    * Task (`idb737272a-ad35-412c-84bb-fe615b4925d1`) to `ide78b8ded-70fd-43fc-9699-acee5a4f095a`
    * Task (`id1cfe480f-8d47-4eff-b6c6-8880f57cbc88`) to `iddbfcda1a-fe29-4119-a63f-7f66c7b4526b`
    * Task (`idb737272a-ad35-412c-84bb-fe615b4925d`) to `idc5b9256f-0a5c-43f7-9877-8a7d17977ee2`
    * Task (`ide522380c-6a5f-4483-b6b2-13869776e4d5`) to `idc5b9256f-0a5c-43f7-9877-8a7d17977ee2`
    * Task (`id394604e4-1b8f-4346-b194-39938251ad53`) to `idc5b9256f-0a5c-43f7-9877-8a7d17977ee2`

This doesn't list tasks explicitly but lists the transition sequences between these tasks or activities represented by their respective `bpmn:sequenceFlow` tags.

If you want a complete listing of task IDs (sourceRef values), additional information on the process diagram's structure would be needed like task names, their descriptions within the BPMN diagram node labels or extensions attributes if any are present in your XML snippet.

For precise identification and listing details:

Please provide additional context such as task/actor/role identifiers, associated activity nodes with explicit name tags if any exist alongside this process model information given currently available data.
