Alright — let's break this down step by step and apply a light **process mining-style phase detection** to your raw sensor logs.

## **Step 1 — First Look: Detecting Activity Phases**

Looking at the numbers, I’ll check for **distinct changes in Temperature, Vibration, Flow, and Energy**, because in manufacturing, these are *key leading indicators* of what stage a process is in.

Here’s what I notice:

- **Events 1–3**  
  - **Temperature**: Low (~20–21 °C, ambient)  
  - **Vibration**: Zero  
  - **Flow**: Zero  
  - **Energy**: Very low (~0.4–0.5 kWh)  
   Looks like **Idle / Machine Setup / Standby**.

- **Events 4–6**  
  - **Temperature**: Jump to 50–58 °C  
  - **Vibration**: Medium–high (30–38 Hz)  
  - **Flow**: Significant (5 units/s)  
  - **Tool Position**: Moving from 0  5  10 mm  
  - **Energy**: 2–3 kWh  
   Clearly **Active Cutting / Milling Operation** — heat + vibration + material flow + tool advance.

- **Events 7–8**  
  - **Temperature**: Moderate (40 °C)  
  - **Pressure**: Slightly higher (2 bar)  
  - **Vibration**: Low (10 Hz)  
  - **Flow**: Low (2 units/s)  
  - **Tool Position**: Holding at 15 mm  
  - **Energy**: Moderate, stable (2 kWh)  
   Likely **Assembly / Positioning** — lower vibration means not aggressively cutting but moving/aligning for next stage.

- **Event 9**  
  - **Temperature**: Sharp rise to 80 °C  
  - **Vibration**: Spike to 50 Hz  
  - **Flow**: 0 (no material feed)  
  - **Energy**: High (5 kWh)  
   Classic **Welding / Heat Treatment** signature — high temp, high vibration, no material flow (heat applied to fixed part).

- **Event 10**  
  - **Temperature**: Cools to 30 °C quickly  
  - **Vibration**: Very low (~1 Hz)  
  - **Flow**: 0  
  - **Energy**: 1 kWh  
   Likely **Cooling / Pause** after welding.

- **Events 11–12**  
  - **Temperature**: 25 °C  
  - **Vibration**: Low (~5 Hz)  
  - **Flow**: Small (1 unit/s)  
  - **Tool Position**: 20 mm  
  - **Energy**: ~1.5 kWh  
   This is probably **Quality Inspection** — slow movement, low vibration, slight sensor activity (flow may be air or measuring device).

- **Events 13–15**  
  - Everything back down to start conditions (idle baseline)  
   **Idle / Standby** again — potentially the end of the batch.

## **Step 2 — Activity Grouping & Labels**

| Activity Phase                | Events              | Sensor Signature Summary                                                                                                                                         | Assigned Label & Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 — Initial Idle / Setup       | 1–3                 | Low temp & energy, no vibration, no flow                                                                                                                          | Machine is powered on but not processing; typical warm-up/setup phase before production.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2 — Cutting / Milling Operation| 4–6                 | Rising temp (50–58 °C), steady moderate-high vibration (30–38 Hz), material flow (5 units/s), advancing tool position, rising energy                              | Strong indicator of a machining process — both mechanical cutting and material removal increase heat, vibration, and power draw.                                                                                                                          |
| 3 — Assembly / Positioning     | 7–8                 | Moderate temp (40 °C), low vibration (10 Hz), low but steady flow (2 units/s), tool position stable at 15 mm, moderate energy                                    | Reduced cutting intensity, suggesting alignment or part joining with light movement.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4 — Welding / Heat Treatment   | 9                   | Very high temp (80 °C) with no material flow, strong vibration spike (possibly electromagnetic/arc), sharp peak in energy use                                    | Welding usually produces high localized heat & high energy draw, without material feed rate — matches perfectly.                                                                                                                                           |
| 5 — Cooling / Short Pause      | 10                  | Drop in temp (30 °C), minimal vibration (1 Hz), no material flow, low energy draw                                                                                 | Natural cool down phase between heat-intensive steps and further handling.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 6 — Quality Inspection         | 11–12               | Room temp (25 °C), low vibration (5 Hz), small material flow (1 unit/s), tool holding position, steady low energy                                                | Indicates delicate movements, possibly scanning, measuring, or visually checking quality before packaging.                                                                                                                                                |
| 7 — Final Idle / End of Batch  | 13–15               | Same as first idle: low temp, zero vibration, zero flow                                                                                                          | End of process — machine is back to rest, awaiting next run.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## **Step 3 — Final Annotated Event Log**

| Event # | Timestamp           | Label                         |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1–3     | 08:00:00–08:00:10  | **Idle / Machine Setup**       |
| 4–6     | 08:00:15–08:00:25  | **Cutting / Milling Operation**|
| 7–8     | 08:00:30–08:00:35  | **Assembly / Positioning**     |
| 9       | 08:00:40           | **Welding / Heat Treatment**   |
| 10      | 08:00:45           | **Cooling / Pause**            |
| 11–12   | 08:00:50–08:00:55  | **Quality Inspection**         |
| 13–15   | 08:01:00–08:01:10  | **Final Idle**                  |

## **Step 4 — Process Mining View**

From this data, the high-level recovered process model might look like:

```
Idle  Cutting/Milling  Assembly/Positioning  Welding  Cooling  Quality Inspection  Idle
```

---

 **Why this makes sense in manufacturing context:**
- **Cutting** has distinct simultaneous vibration, temp rise, material feed.
- **Welding** has extreme point temperature and electrical energy draw, but zero flow.
- **Assembly** has mechanical movement but far lower thermal and vibrational intensity.
- **Inspection** shows low-intensity mechanical motion and minimal energy, consistent with measurement tasks.
- Idle phases book-end the process, matching machine behavior before and after a batch.

If you want, I can **automate this phase detection** using thresholds & clustering so any similar event log can be labeled without manual inspection.  
Do you want me to prepare a **Python process mining script** next?
