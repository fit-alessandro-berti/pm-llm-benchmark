The image is a multi-part diagram showing how two process classes (a “Lab visit” and a “Lab test”) interact via message channels, plus an example message record. It is organized into three labeled subfigures (a), (b) and (c):

- (a) “Two proclet classes connected through two channels”
  - Left side: the Lab visit proclet (workflow) with activities and actors illustrated. Steps include “Order entry,” “Take blood sample,” “Receive result,” “Judge results” (decision leading either to “Everythin[g] fine” or “Do tests again”), “Receive updated result,” and “Send report.” Small actor icons label roles such as doctor and lab assistant.
  - Right side: the Lab test proclet showing the laboratory-side workflow: “Perform test,” “Make report,” “Perform test again,” “Provide updated report,” and “Finish lab test.” Chemical analyst is shown as the actor for many lab tasks.
  - Between the two proclets are two dashed-channel boxes (labeled “Order system” and “HIS”) representing communication channels. Message flows (dashed lines with multiplicities like 1..1 or 1..*) connect specific activities on the Lab visit side to activities on the Lab test side. Solid arrows show the internal control flow within each proclet; filled circle/black square elements mark start/termination points.

- (b) “Class diagram containing the two proclet classes”
  - A small UML-like class diagram at the top right that shows the relationship between the two proclet classes: Lab visit requires Lab test, with multiplicities indicated (e.g. one-to-many).

- (c) “Example of a performative”
  - A tabular example of a message (performative) exchanged over a channel. Columns include Time (11:00), Channel (Order system), Sender (Lab visit - John), Receivers (Lab test - HGB John), Action (Create), Content (“Can you perform a HGB test for John?”), Scope (Private), and Direction (OUT). This illustrates the metadata captured for an inter-proclet communication.

Overall the visualization conveys how two distinct processes coordinate by sending/receiving messages over named channels, the mapping between process activities and channel endpoints, and an example of the message-level information exchanged.
