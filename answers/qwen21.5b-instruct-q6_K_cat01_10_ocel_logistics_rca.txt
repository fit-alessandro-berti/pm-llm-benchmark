Based on the given event data, here are some potential root causes for the performance issues:

  * High frequency of events (low duration): Events may occur frequently but with short durations, leading to slow response times. For example, "pick item" has a high frequency of 948 and a short duration of 7638.24 seconds.
  * Slow object creation: There are many object creations in the process, such as "create package" -> "send package" -> "package delivered", with over 1000 objects created each event. This can significantly impact overall performance.

  * Long object duration: Objects have a long duration (up to 20 seconds), which can slow down response times.
  * Low frequency of events: The number of events is relatively low compared to the duration, indicating that many small actions are happening instead of just one large action like "create package" -> "send package" -> "package delivered".
  * Large object size: There is an unusually large object size (over 20 bytes), which can impact performance when transferring data.

To address these issues:

  * Optimize event creation and processing: Reduce the number of objects created during each event to reduce object duration. This could involve optimizing code or implementing caching mechanisms.
  * Improve network latency: If possible, reduce the overall network latency by moving some events closer together in time or reducing communication bandwidth requirements for certain processes.

By addressing these specific root causes, you can potentially improve performance and response times across your application.
