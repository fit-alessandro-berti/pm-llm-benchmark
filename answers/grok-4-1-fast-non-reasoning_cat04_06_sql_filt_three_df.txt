```sql
WITH target_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT el1.case_id
  FROM event_log el1
  JOIN event_log el2 ON el1.case_id = el2.case_id 
    AND el2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND el2.timestamp > el1.timestamp
  JOIN event_log el3 ON el2.case_id = el3.case_id
    AND el3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND el3.timestamp > el2.timestamp
  WHERE el1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM event_log el_mid 
      WHERE el_mid.case_id = el1.case_id
        AND el_mid.timestamp > el1.timestamp
        AND el_mid.timestamp < el2.timestamp
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM event_log el_mid 
      WHERE el_mid.case_id = el2.case_id
        AND el_mid.timestamp > el2.timestamp
        AND el_mid.timestamp < el3.timestamp
    )
    AND (el3.timestamp - el2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM target_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

This query works as follows:

1. **Identifies the exact sequence**: Uses three self-joins to find cases where:
   - `el1` = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   - `el2` = 'Create Order' (after el1)
   - `el3` = 'Confirm Order' (after el2)

2. **Ensures direct succession**: Uses `NOT EXISTS` subqueries to verify no other events exist between:
   - el1 and el2 timestamps
   - el2 and el3 timestamps

3. **Applies time filter**: `(el3.timestamp - el2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY` ensures >5 days between Create Order and Confirm Order

4. **Excludes matching cases**: The final `WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM target_cases)` excludes all events from cases meeting both criteria

5. **Returns all other events**: Selects all columns from `event_log` for qualifying cases, ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for readability

The result contains **all events from cases that do NOT have the forbidden sequence with >5 days delay**.
