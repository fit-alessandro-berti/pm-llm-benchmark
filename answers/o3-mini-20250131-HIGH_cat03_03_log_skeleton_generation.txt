Below is one example of a Log Skeleton for the described order fulfillment process. In this example we assume that the process is strictly sequential and that each activity occurs exactly once per case. We also assume that two pairs of activities must “stick together” (i.e. occur the same number of times): namely, if items are reserved then they are picked, and if the customer is invoiced then the payment is recorded. Finally, since there is no alternative branch in this simplified process, no two activities are mutually exclusive.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # Equivalence: the two activities occur the same number of times in a case.
    'equivalence': {
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserve Items and Pick Items must occur equally
        ('IC', 'RP')   # Invoice Customer and Record Payment must occur equally
    },
    # Always Before: if the first activity occurs then the second must have occurred earlier.
    # For example, if Check Availability (CA) occurs then Receive Order (RO) must have occurred before.
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),
        ('RI', 'CA'),
        ('PI', 'RI'),
        ('QC', 'PI'),
        ('PO', 'QC'),
        ('GSL', 'PO'),
        ('D', 'GSL'),
        ('IC', 'D'),
        ('RP', 'IC')
    },
    # Always After: if the first activity occurs then the second will eventually occur later.
    # For example, if RO occurs then CA will occur later in the trace.
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    },
    # Never Together: these activities may not appear in the same case.
    # In our linear process no alternative branch exists, so this set is empty.
    'never_together': set(),
    # Activity Occurrences: each activity is executed exactly once.
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {1}
    },
    # Directly-Follows: these pairs of activities occur consecutively in the trace.
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    }
}

# For demonstration, print the Log Skeleton dictionary.
import pprint
pprint.pprint(log_skeleton)
```

### Explanation

1. **Equivalence:**  
   - `('RI', 'PI')`: Every time items are reserved, they must also be picked.  
   - `('IC', 'RP')`: An invoice and its corresponding payment record are always both present.

2. **Always Before / Always After:**  
   These constraints enforce a strict order. For example,  
   - *Always Before:* `('CA', 'RO')` means that if Check Availability occurs then Receive Order must have occurred earlier.  
   - *Always After:* `('RO', 'CA')` means that if Receive Order occurs then Check Availability must follow sometime later.  
   The full chain is:  
   `RO → CA → RI → PI → QC → PO → GSL → D → IC → RP`

3. **Never Together:**  
   In this process, no two activities are mutually exclusive so the set is empty.

4. **Activity Occurrences:**  
   Every activity is expected to appear exactly once per case.

5. **Directly-Follows:**  
   This reinforces the immediate succession between activities, as expected in a strictly sequential process.

This dictionary is one valid representation of the Log Skeleton for the given scenario. Depending on further details or variations in the real process, you might adjust the occurrence frequencies or add alternative paths (which would then likely use the `never_together` constraint).
