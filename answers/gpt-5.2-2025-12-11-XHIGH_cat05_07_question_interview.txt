29. What is the decision process when issues are found—who determines severity, timelines, and whether the property can be marketed “pending repairs”?
30. How are repairs handled in practice—landlord-managed vs. company-managed contractors, approvals, budgets, and proof-of-completion?
31. What are the most common inspection failures, and what preventive steps do you take to reduce rework?
32. What happens if the landlord refuses required fixes—do you pause, terminate onboarding, or accept risk with disclosures?

57. How are audit results recorded, and do you have recurring audit themes that drive process changes?

## Exceptions & special cases

71. What feedback loops exist—how do you capture lessons learned from onboarding issues and update policy/training?

If you’d like, I can also turn these into a structured interview guide (by phase, with follow-ups) based on whether you’re mapping the “current state” or designing a “future state” process.
