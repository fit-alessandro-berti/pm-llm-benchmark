1) How do varying lead times and quality metrics across suppliers influence the master production schedule and buffer stock policies at the Malaysian assembly plant?
2) What contingency plans exist if a critical component supplier (e.g., microprocessors from Taiwan) experiences a geopolitical disruption or natural disaster, and how quickly can alternate sources be qualified?
3) How are trade-offs managed between just-in-time replenishment for high-demand markets and the risk of stockouts due to transportation delays or customs bottlenecks?
4) In what ways could multi-sourcing or modular product design reduce supply risk without significantly increasing unit cost or complexity?
5) How is demand variability across regions incorporated into dynamic safety stock calculations, and how frequently are those parameters recalibrated?
6) What end-to-end visibility exists into supplier sub-tier networks (e.g., raw materials for camera modules), and how is risk propagated and mitigated at those deeper tiers?
7) How do differences in regulatory requirements (e.g., environmental, labor, product safety) across countries impact component selection, labeling, and documentation workflows?
8) What metrics best capture the true cost-to-serve for each market channel (retail, e-commerce, direct-to-consumer), and how are they used in pricing and allocation decisions?
9) How does the company validate and maintain consistent quality standards across assembly shifts, automation cells, and manual operations, especially during volume ramps?
10) What role do predictive analytics and machine learning play in early detection of demand shifts, and how are forecast signals reconciled with planner judgment?
11) How are carbon footprint and sustainability objectives embedded into sourcing, transportation mode selection, and packaging design without compromising service levels?
12) What strategies are in place to prevent counterfeit or gray-market leakage, and how are serialization and track-and-trace data leveraged?
13) How quickly can the supply chain pivot to new model introductions or engineering changes, and what is the impact on existing inventory and contractual commitments?
14) What incentives and performance scorecards align suppliers and logistics partners with on-time delivery, quality, and sustainability targets?
15) How are warranty returns, repair/refurbish flows, and potential recalls integrated into reverse logistics, and what data from after-sales support feeds continuous improvement?
16) How do currency fluctuations and hedging strategies influence sourcing decisions, pricing, and margin stability across regions?
17) What digital integration standards (e.g., EDI, APIs) are used with suppliers and logistics partners, and where do data latency or quality gaps create planning errors?
18) How are capacity constraints at the assembly plant prioritized among competing models and markets, and what rules guide allocation during shortages?
19) What is the business case for nearshoring or regional assembly hubs to reduce lead time and risk, and how would it affect total landed cost and resilience?
20) How are ethical sourcing, labor audits, and supplier development programs operationalized to ensure compliance and build long-term supply chain resilience?
