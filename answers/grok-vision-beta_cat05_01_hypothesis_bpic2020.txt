Here is a list of 20 relevant questions about the process variants, along with a confidence score for each question based on the information provided:

1. **What is the average performance time for a declaration to be handled from submission to payment?** 
   - *Confidence Score: 90%* - This question directly relates to the performance metrics provided for each process variant.

2. **Which process variant has the highest frequency of occurrence?**
   - *Confidence Score: 100%* - The frequency of each variant is explicitly listed.

3. **Which roles are involved in the approval process of a declaration?**
   - *Confidence Score: 100%* - Various roles like EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER are mentioned in the process steps.

4. **What is the impact of having an additional approval step by the BUDGET OWNER on the process performance?**
   - *Confidence Score: 85%* - This can be inferred by comparing the performance times of variants with and without this step.

5. **How does the rejection by ADMINISTRATION affect the overall process time?**
   - *Confidence Score: 80%* - This can be assessed by comparing the performance times of variants where ADMINISTRATION rejects versus approves.

6. **What are the most common reasons for a declaration to be rejected at any stage?**
   - *Confidence Score: 50%* - While the data shows rejections, specific reasons for rejection aren't provided.

7. **What is the frequency of declarations that never reach the payment stage due to rejections?**
   - *Confidence Score: 75%* - This can be calculated by summing up frequencies where the process ends before payment.

8. **How often does a declaration need to be resubmitted due to rejection?**
   - *Confidence Score: 80%* - This can be deduced from the variants where the process loops back to submission.

9. **What is the total performance time for all declarations that were eventually handled?**
   - *Confidence Score: 60%* - This would require summing up performance times for all variants leading to payment, which might not be directly calculable without further data aggregation.

10. **Is there a correlation between the number of approval steps and the performance time?**
    - *Confidence Score: 70%* - This question invites analysis, though the data doesn't directly show correlation coefficients.

11. **What percentage of declarations involve a PRE_APPROVER?**
    - *Confidence Score: 90%* - This can be calculated by summing the frequencies of variants involving a PRE_APPROVER.

12. **How does the involvement of a SUPERVISOR affect the performance time?**
    - *Confidence Score: 80%* - By comparing variants with and without SUPERVISOR involvement.

13. **What is the efficiency of the process when a declaration is saved versus submitted?**
    - *Confidence Score: 50%* - The data shows a 'SAVED' status, but efficiency comparison isn't directly available.

14. **What is the longest process variant in terms of steps before payment is handled?**
    - *Confidence Score: 95%* - This can be identified by counting steps in each variant.

15. **How many times does the process involve a rejection before final approval?**
    - *Confidence Score: 85%* - This can be counted from the variants where rejections occur before final approval.

16. **What is the average number of rejections per declaration that eventually gets paid?**
    - *Confidence Score: 70%* - This requires analysis of rejection frequencies in successful payment paths.

17. **Does the presence of a BUDGET OWNER in the process increase or decrease the likelihood of final approval?**
    - *Confidence Score: 60%* - This would need comparative analysis of approval rates with and without BUDGET OWNER.

18. **What is the performance time difference between the most and least frequent process variants?**
    - *Confidence Score: 85%* - Direct comparison of the performance times of these variants.

19. **How does the process handle cases where a declaration is rejected by a SUPERVISOR after ADMINISTRATION approval?**
    - *Confidence Score: 80%* - This scenario is visible in several variants.

20. **What steps are most commonly involved when a declaration is rejected by MISSING?**
    - *Confidence Score: 70%* - This can be inferred from the variants where 'MISSING' appears, though the reason for 'MISSING' isn't specified.

These questions aim to explore the efficiency, bottlenecks, roles involved, and the impact of different approval and rejection scenarios within the process. The confidence scores reflect how directly the data provided can be used to answer these questions.
