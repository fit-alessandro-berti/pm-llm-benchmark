Based on the provided declarative constraints, the process underlying this data appears to be a multi-stage approval process for declarations, likely related to some form of request or payment handling. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Declaration Submission**:
   - An employee can submit a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).
   - An employee can also save a declaration (`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`), but this cannot co-exist with submission or rejection by the employee in the same case.

2. **Pre-Approval**:
   - After submission, a pre-approver reviews the declaration (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`). This step can either lead to approval (`Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`) or rejection (`Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER` or `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`).
   - If approved by the pre-approver, the declaration moves to the next stage. If rejected, it cannot be approved by the budget owner or the administration in the same case.

3. **Administration Approval**:
   - After pre-approval, the administration reviews the declaration (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`). This can result in approval (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`), rejection (`Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`), or a request for payment (`Request Payment`).
   - If approved by the administration, it can then move to the supervisor for final approval. If rejected, it cannot be approved by the pre-approver or the budget owner in the same case.

4. **Supervisor Approval**:
   - After administration approval, the supervisor reviews the declaration (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`). This can result in final approval (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`), approval (`Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`), or rejection (`Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`).
   - If finally approved by the supervisor, the payment can be handled (`Payment Handled`). If rejected, it cannot co-exist with payment handled or approval by the administration in the same case.

5. **Budget Owner Approval**:
   - At some point in the process, the budget owner also reviews the declaration (`Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER` or `Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`). This step seems to be interconnected with the other approval steps, as it has constraints related to pre-approval, administration approval, and supervisor approval.

Throughout the process, certain activities cannot co-exist within the same case due to the "Never Together" constraints. Additionally, the process flow is guided by the "Always Before", "Always After", and "Directly-Follows" constraints. The "Activity Occurrences" constraints define the possible number of times each activity can occur within a case.

In summary, the process is a sequential approval workflow involving multiple stakeholders (employee, pre-approver, administration, supervisor, and budget owner) with various constraints guiding the flow and ensuring proper handling of declarations.
