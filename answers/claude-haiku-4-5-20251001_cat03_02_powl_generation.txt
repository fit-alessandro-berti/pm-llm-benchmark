# Step 1: Create all individual transitions

GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval (GLA)")

# Step 2: Create the loop for configuration phase
# Loop structure: BNC is the main activity, D&R is the optional repeat activity
# * (BNC, D&R) means: execute BNC, then either exit the loop or execute D&R and go back to BNC
config_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Step 3: Create the exclusive choice for deployment method
# X (CD, MD) means: choose either Containerized Deployment or Monolithic Deployment
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 4: Create partial order for final tasks (QA and SA can be done concurrently)
final_tasks_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
# No order edges added between QA and SA, so they can execute in parallel

# Step 5: Create partial order for the entire process
# Nodes include: SR, CS, parallel tasks (DA, ACI), config_loop, deployment_choice, 
# final_tasks_po (which contains QA and SA), and GLA
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    SR,
    CS,
    DA,
    ACI,
    config_loop,
    deployment_choice,
    final_tasks_po,
    GLA
])

# Step 6: Define the ordering constraints
# SR must complete before CS
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# CS must complete before DA and ACI (both can start after CS, independently)
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# Both DA and ACI must complete before the configuration loop
root.order.add_edge(DA, config_loop)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, config_loop)

# Configuration loop must complete before deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(config_loop, deployment_choice)

# Deployment choice must complete before final tasks (QA and SA)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, final_tasks_po)

# Final tasks (QA and SA) must both complete before GLA
root.order.add_edge(final_tasks_po, GLA)

# The root POWL model is now complete and can be visualized or exported

## **Explanation of the POWL Model Structure:**

### **1. Sequential Phase (SR  CS):**
- `Service Request (SR)` must complete first
- Then `Contract Setup (CS)` follows as a prerequisite

### **2. Parallel Phase (DA and ACI):**
- After CS completes, `Datacenter Allocation (DA)` and `Access Control Initialization (ACI)` can run concurrently
- They have no ordering constraint between them (both point to the config_loop)

### **3. Loop Phase (BNC with optional D&R):**
- Created using `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.LOOP`
- Represents: execute BNC, optionally execute D&R and loop back, or exit the loop
- Both DA and ACI must complete before entering this loop

### **4. Exclusive Choice Phase (CD or MD):**
- Created using `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR`
- Represents: choose either Containerized Deployment OR Monolithic Deployment (but not both)
- Can only start after configuration_loop completes

### **5. Concurrent Final Tasks (QA and SA):**
- Created as a `StrictPartialOrder` with both nodes but **no ordering edges between them**
- This allows QA and SA to execute in parallel or in any order
- Both must complete before GLA

### **6. Final Step (GLA):**
- `Go-Live Approval (GLA)` is the final transition
- Can only start after the final_tasks_po (containing both QA and SA) completes

This POWL model faithfully captures the complex telecom service provisioning workflow with its mix of sequential dependencies, parallel execution, loops, and exclusive choices.
