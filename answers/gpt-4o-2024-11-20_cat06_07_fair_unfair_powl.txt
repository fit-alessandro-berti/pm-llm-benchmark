Below are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, as specified in the task. The first model demonstrates how unfairness can occur, whereas the second model ensures fairness by eliminating the special branching for community affiliation.

---

### 1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

In this model, the unfairness appears in the XOR branching after the skill assessment. One branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation, while the other provides applicants with community affiliation or local resident status with a slight advantage.

Here is the POWL model:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions (activities in the hiring process)
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define silent transition (skip for XOR branches, if applicants don't go to one path)
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define loop for data completeness check
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_more_info])

# Define XOR branch for cultural fit evaluation
xor_branch = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_check, community_affiliation_check])

# Define partial order of nodes
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, loop, skill_assessment, xor_branch, managerial_review, final_decision])

# Add execution order
root.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor_branch)
root.order.add_edge(xor_branch, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

Key difference in this model:  
- The **`community_affiliation_check`** branch represents potential unfairness, as it subtly adjusts scores based on affiliations or local residency, providing an implicit advantage to certain applicants.

---

### 2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness**

In this model, all applicants follow the same process after the skill assessment. There is no special XOR branching for community affiliation or local residency, ensuring fairness.

Here is the updated POWL model:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions (activities in the hiring process)
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define silent transition (used in loops)
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define loop for data completeness check
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_more_info])

# Define partial order of nodes
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, loop, skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check, managerial_review, final_decision])

# Add execution order
root.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_check, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

Key difference in this model:  
- The **`cultural_fit_check`** is now universal, with all applicants being evaluated on the same criteria. The **`community_affiliation_check`** activity is removed, ensuring there are no implicit advantages for applicants with specific affiliations or residency.

### Summary of Models and their Key Features:
| **POWL Model**               | **Fairness/Unfairness**                                                                         | **XOR Operator Usage**                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **With Potential Unfairness** | Includes a branch where applicants with community affiliation receive implicit scoring boosts | XOR operator splits between `cultural_fit_check` (standard) and `community_affiliation_check` (biased). |
| **Without Unfairness**        | All applicants proceed through the same cultural fit evaluation process                      | No XOR operator after `skill_assessment`. Everyone goes through `cultural_fit_check`.                 |

This approach eliminates potential bias in the second model and ensures fairness in the hiring process.
