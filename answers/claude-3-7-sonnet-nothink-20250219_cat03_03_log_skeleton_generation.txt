I'll construct a Log Skeleton model for the order fulfillment process based on the activities and their logical relationships.

First, let me analyze the process flow to identify the constraints:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    'always_before': set(),
    'always_after': set(),
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {},
    'directly_follows': set()
}
```

Let's populate each constraint:

## 1. Equivalence
Every order that is received must be dispatched, and vice versa. Similarly, every order that is packed must have a shipping label generated.

```python
log_skeleton['equivalence'] = {
    ('RO', 'D'),       # Receive Order and Dispatch occur the same number of times
    ('PO', 'GSL')      # Pack Order and Generate Shipping Label occur the same number of times
}
```

## 2. Always Before
There's a clear sequence in the process:
- Check Availability must happen after Receive Order
- Reserve Items must happen after Check Availability
- Pick Items must happen after Reserve Items
- Quality Check must happen after Pick Items
- Pack Order must happen after Quality Check
- Generate Shipping Label must happen after Pack Order
- Dispatch must happen after Generate Shipping Label
- Invoice Customer must happen after Dispatch

```python
log_skeleton['always_before'] = {
    ('CA', 'RO'),      # Check Availability always after Receive Order
    ('RI', 'CA'),      # Reserve Items always after Check Availability
    ('PI', 'RI'),      # Pick Items always after Reserve Items
    ('QC', 'PI'),      # Quality Check always after Pick Items
    ('PO', 'QC'),      # Pack Order always after Quality Check
    ('GSL', 'PO'),     # Generate Shipping Label always after Pack Order
    ('D', 'GSL'),      # Dispatch always after Generate Shipping Label
    ('IC', 'D')        # Invoice Customer always after Dispatch
}
```

## 3. Always After
This is the inverse of Always Before:

```python
log_skeleton['always_after'] = {
    ('RO', 'CA'),      # Receive Order always before Check Availability
    ('CA', 'RI'),      # Check Availability always before Reserve Items
    ('RI', 'PI'),      # Reserve Items always before Pick Items
    ('PI', 'QC'),      # Pick Items always before Quality Check
    ('QC', 'PO'),      # Quality Check always before Pack Order
    ('PO', 'GSL'),     # Pack Order always before Generate Shipping Label
    ('GSL', 'D'),      # Generate Shipping Label always before Dispatch
    ('D', 'IC'),       # Dispatch always before Invoice Customer
    ('IC', 'RP')       # Invoice Customer always before Record Payment
}
```

## 4. Never Together
In this process, there aren't activities that can't coexist in the same case, as all activities are part of the normal flow. However, if we consider that Record Payment might not always happen (e.g., for unpaid orders), we could say:

```python
log_skeleton['never_together'] = set()  # No activities are mutually exclusive
```

## 5. Activity Occurrences
Each activity typically occurs exactly once per order, but Record Payment might not occur if the customer hasn't paid yet:

```python
log_skeleton['activ_freq'] = {
    'RO': {1},     # Receive Order occurs exactly once
    'CA': {1},     # Check Availability occurs exactly once
    'RI': {1},     # Reserve Items occurs exactly once
    'PI': {1},     # Pick Items occurs exactly once
    'QC': {1},     # Quality Check occurs exactly once
    'PO': {1},     # Pack Order occurs exactly once
    'GSL': {1},    # Generate Shipping Label occurs exactly once
    'D': {1},      # Dispatch occurs exactly once
    'IC': {1},     # Invoice Customer occurs exactly once
    'RP': {0, 1}   # Record Payment occurs 0 or 1 time (may not happen if customer hasn't paid)
}
```

## 6. Directly-Follows Constraints
Based on the typical flow of activities:

```python
log_skeleton['directly_follows'] = {
    ('RO', 'CA'),      # Check Availability directly follows Receive Order
    ('CA', 'RI'),      # Reserve Items directly follows Check Availability
    ('RI', 'PI'),      # Pick Items directly follows Reserve Items
    ('PI', 'QC'),      # Quality Check directly follows Pick Items
    ('QC', 'PO'),      # Pack Order directly follows Quality Check
    ('PO', 'GSL'),     # Generate Shipping Label directly follows Pack Order
    ('GSL', 'D'),      # Dispatch directly follows Generate Shipping Label
    ('D', 'IC'),       # Invoice Customer directly follows Dispatch
    ('IC', 'RP')       # Record Payment directly follows Invoice Customer (when payment occurs)
}
```

## Complete Log Skeleton

Here's the complete Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'D'),
        ('PO', 'GSL')
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),
        ('RI', 'CA'),
        ('PI', 'RI'),
        ('QC', 'PI'),
        ('PO', 'QC'),
        ('GSL', 'PO'),
        ('D', 'GSL'),
        ('IC', 'D')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    },
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {0, 1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    }
}
```

This Log Skeleton captures the constraints of the order fulfillment process, showing the sequence of activities, their frequency, and their relationships to each other.
