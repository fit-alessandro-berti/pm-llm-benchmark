To optimize the given BPMN-based process towards reduced turnaround time and greater flexibility, especially concerning non-standard (custom) requests, it is useful to consider automation, dynamic resource allocation, and predictive analytics.

---

### 1. Leveraging Automation in Early Stages

#### Task A: "Receive Customer Request" (Enhanced Automation)
- **Current approach:** Possibly manual receipt and preliminary sorting.
- **Optimized approach:**
  - **Introduce machine-learning driven text/submission classification.** 
  - Utilize NLP tools to automatically classify requests as standard or custom, even if not explicitly stated by customers.
  - Automate entry into Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, enabling instant notification and workload balancing.

**Impact:**  
- Improves accuracy and speed of routing.  
- Reduces human interaction at the early stage, freeing human operators for complex tasks.

#### New Gateway (Predictive XOR): "Predictive Request Type Check"
- **Use historical request data and machine learning models to predict if custom feasibility analysis is likely required**.
- Route borderline or uncertain cases to accelerated review subprocess—minimizing delays due to misclassification.

---

### 2. Dynamic and Predictive Resource Allocation for Non-Standard Requests

#### Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis" (Dynamic allocation)
- **Current approach:** Custom feasibility analysis might rely on standard static teams/resources.
- **Optimized approach:**
  - Integrate dynamic resource management, rapidly assembling specialized teams based on identified complexity.
  - Deploy workflow management solutions to immediately schedule optimal resources.
  - Employ workload prediction algorithms to proactively plan resource availability ahead of peak times and high-complexity cycles.

**Impact:**  
- Reduced waiting time for expertise availability.  
- Increased responsiveness to customized requests leading to higher customer satisfaction, though potentially increasing some complexity in resource management.

#### Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation" (Partial Automation)
- **Current approach:** Likely manual or semi-manual task.
- **Optimized approach:**
  - Automate parts of quotation creation leveraging rule-driven engines using historical pricing and similar previous scenarios predictions.
  - Generate preliminary quotations instantly or semi-automatically, requiring human oversight rather than preparation from scratch.

**Impact:**  
- Greatly reduces turnaround times for custom quotations.  
- Maintains flexibility and personal touch through partial automation rather than full automation.

### 3. New Predictive Analytics Capabilities

#### New Task/Automated Subprocess: "Predictive Analytics for Early Customization Risk Scoring"
- Adds automated analytics subprocess immediately following initial automation.
- Leverages historical customer behavior, inventory patterns, and market trends to proactively identify:

  - Probability of Customization requests requiring feasibility tests.
  - Anticipated customization complexity level.
  - Likelihood of managerial approval needed or potential requirement delays.

- Routes requests proactively to preemptive validation teams or "fast-track" approval teams, mitigating delays and enhancing responsiveness.

---

### 4. Redesign Gateways and Decision Points

#### Modified Gateway (XOR) after Feasibility Check: "Dynamic Customization Feasibility Check"
- Shift from simple binary decision ("Is feasible? Y/N") towards nuanced multidimensional scoring models:
  - “High Feasibility,” “Moderate Feasibility” (requiring negotiation or further inquiry), or "Low/No Feasibility."
- Assign decision thresholds dynamically based on predictive scoring rather than fixed traditional measures.

#### New Gateway (XOR): "Predictive Approval Requirement Check"
- **Current:** Approval requirement decided after feasibility analysis completion.
- **Optimized:** Shift earlier in the workflow using analytics:
  - Predict approval need and proactively initiate manager notification or preliminary consent requests concurrently during feasibility analysis instead of waiting until afterward. 
  - Enables parallel execution, compressing both feasibility analysis and approval waiting times.

---

### 5. Improve Task-Level Optimization (For Standard Requests as Reference)

#### Tasks C1 ("Credit Check") and C2 ("Inventory Check"):
- Integrate real-time systems for real-time credit scores and inventory management.
- Automate fully, resulting in instantaneous parallel execution and completion, slashing delays and freeing resources.

#### Task D: ("Calculate Delivery Date"):
- Automate date calculations with real-time logistics modeling software, customer data, historical patterns—thus swiftly generating accurate estimates.

---

### 6. Streamlined Approval and Reevaluation Loops

#### Gateways / Approval Loops:
- When approval is declined ("Approval not granted"), avoid repetitive linear loops.  
- Introduce "Fast Track Negotiation Subprocess" instead of directly looping back:
  - Provide structured negotiation channels between managers, sales teams, and customers to rapidly resolve conditions and quickly return to the tailored quotation or recalculation process.

### Revised Pseudo-BPMN Representation (Optimized Example):

```
Start Event --> Automated Task A ("Smart Customer Request Classification")
    --> Predictive XOR ("Predictive Request Type Check")
        --> [Predicted Standard] 
              Automated Task B1 ("Standard Validation & Instant Checks")
                 --> Automated Parallel Tasks C1 ("Real-time Credit Check") and C2 ("Real-time Stock Check")
                 --> Task D ("Automated Delivery Date Calculation")
        --> [Predicted Custom] 
              Task B2 ("Dynamic Resource Allocation & Feasibility Analysis")
                 --> Predictive Subprocess ("Customization Risk Scoring")
                 --> Enhanced XOR ("Dynamic Customization Feasibility Check")
                     --> [High feasibility] Semi-Automated Task E1 ("Automated Custom Quote Draft + Manual oversight")
                     --> [Moderate/Low feasibility] Task E2 ("Optimized Rejection Communication") --> End Event

   --> After Standard/Custom Path Completed
        --> Predictive XOR ("Predictive Approval Requirement Check (Early Trigger)") 
            --> [If Approval Needed] Task F ("Parallel Manager Approval - Concurrent with prior tasks")
                  --> XOR ("Dynamic Approval Decision")
                      --> [Approved] Automated Task G ("Real-time Invoice Generation")
                      --> [Not approved] Subprocess ("Fast-track negotiation")
                           --> Loop back efficiently to modified Tasks E1/D based on original route 
            --> [Not required] Automated Task G ("Real-time Invoice Generation")
            
   --> Automated Notification Task I ("Automatic Confirmation & Real-time customer updates")
End Event
```

### Potential Outcomes of this Optimized Process:

#### **Overall Performance:**
- Significant reduction in manual workload.
- Markedly decreased request turnaround times (reduced human intervention/ errors, parallel processing, predictive insights).
- Agile and proactive handling of customized scenarios.

#### **Customer Satisfaction:**
- Accelerated responses, more accurate initial estimates, and proactive communications bolster customer confidence and satisfaction.
- Reduced potential frustration due to fewer unforeseen delays.

#### **Operational Complexity:**
- Increased system complexity due to stronger reliance on automation, predictive modeling, and dynamic allocation solutions.
- Requires robust supportive IT infrastructure, continuous model training, and monitoring to ensure effectiveness of predictive analytics and automation.

### Conclusion:

The optimized model achieves considerable efficiency gains and responsiveness through the thoughtfully increased use of automation, predictive analytics, and dynamic resource allocation. While moderately raising internal complexity, this strategic redesign significantly improves responsiveness, flexibility, and customer experience, making the organization more agile in handling variability and proactively managing customer requests.
