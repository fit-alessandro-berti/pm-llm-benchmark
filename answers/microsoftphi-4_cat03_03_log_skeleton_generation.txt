To construct the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process, we need to define the constraints between different activities as specified in the question. Let's break down the process and establish these constraints:

### Process Overview

1. **Receive Order (RO)**: The start of the process.
2. **Check Availability (CA)**: Follows receiving the order to ensure items are in stock.
3. **Reserve Items (RI)**: Can only occur after checking availability if the items are available.
4. **Pick Items (PI)**: Occurs after reserving items.
5. **Quality Check (QC)**: Follows picking items.
6. **Pack Order (PO)**: Occurs after passing the quality check.
7. **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**: Follows packing the order.
8. **Dispatch (D)**: Occurs after generating a shipping label.
9. **Invoice Customer (IC)**: Can happen after dispatching the order.
10. **Record Payment (RP)**: Records payment after invoicing.

### Constraints

#### Equivalence
- We don't have activities that must occur the same number of times as others in this process.

#### Always Before
- RO must always occur before CA, RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, and RP.
- CA must always occur before RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, and RP.
- RI must always occur before PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, and RP.
- PI must always occur before QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, and RP.
- QC must always occur before PO, GSL, D, IC, and RP.
- PO must always occur before GSL, D, IC, and RP.
- GSL must always occur before D, IC, and RP.
- D must always occur before IC and RP.

#### Always After
- CA can occur after RO.
- RI can occur after CA.
- PI can occur after RI.
- QC can occur after PI.
- PO can occur after QC.
- GSL can occur after PO.
- D can occur after GSL.
- IC can occur after D.
- RP can occur after IC.

#### Never Together
- There are no activities that should never occur together in this scenario.

#### Activity Occurrences
- Each activity should occur exactly once per order process, except generating a shipping label, which depends on packing being done.

#### Directly-Follows
- CA should directly follow RO.
- RI should directly follow CA.
- PI should directly follow RI.
- QC should directly follow PI.
- PO should directly follow QC.
- GSL should directly follow PO.
- D should directly follow GSL.
- IC should directly follow D.
- RP should directly follow IC.

### Python Dictionary

Here's the Log Skeleton as a Python dictionary:

    }
}
```

This dictionary defines the constraints for the order fulfillment process in the distribution center. Each activity is expected to occur exactly once per case, except for any specific business rule deviations not mentioned here.
