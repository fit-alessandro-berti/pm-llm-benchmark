Below is a Python code snippet that implements a Process Tree for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process using pm4py. The P2P process outlined here includes the following steps, grouped by their logical workflow:

1. **Purchase Request**
   - Create Purchase Request (`Activity: CPR`)
   - Approve/Reject Purchase Request (`XOR` between `Approve PR` and `Reject PR`)

2. **Ordering**
   - **Sequence** after Purchase Request Approval:
     - Create Purchase Order (`Activity: CPO`)
     - Send Purchase Order to Supplier (`Activity: SPO`)

3. **Receiving and Invoicing**
   - **Parallel** to each other, after Sending the Purchase Order:
     - Receive Goods (`Activity: RG`)
     - Receive Invoice (`Activity: RI`)
   - **Sequence** after both Receiving Goods and Invoice:
     - Verify Receipt vs Invoice (`Activity: VRI`)
     - **XOR** between Approve Invoice for Payment (`Activity: AIP`) and Dispute Invoice (`Activity: DI`)

4. **Payment**
   - **Sequence** after Approving Invoice for Payment:
     - Process Payment (`Activity: PP`)
     - Confirm Payment to Supplier (`Activity: CPS`)

Here's how you could implement this in pm4py:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Root of the Process Tree (Parallel because PR and subsequent steps can be seen as a single flow for simplicity)
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Purchase Request Branch
PR_Branch = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
root.children.append(PR_Branch)

CPR = ProcessTree(label="Create Purchase Request", parent=PR_Branch)
PR_Branch.children.append(CPR)

PR_Decision = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=PR_Branch)
PR_Branch.children.append(PR_Decision)

Approve_PR = ProcessTree(label="Approve PR", parent=PR_Decision)
Reject_PR = ProcessTree(label="Reject PR", parent=PR_Decision)
PR_Decision.children.extend([Approve_PR, Reject_PR])

# Ordering Branch (Sequence after PR Approval, so it's a child of Approve_PR for logical flow)
Ordering_Branch = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=Approve_PR)
Approve_PR.children.append(Ordering_Branch)

CPO = ProcessTree(label="Create Purchase Order", parent=Ordering_Branch)
SPO = ProcessTree(label="Send Purchase Order to Supplier", parent=Ordering_Branch)
Ordering_Branch.children.extend([CPO, SPO])

# Receiving and Invoicing Branch (Parallel after Sending PO, so under SPO for flow)
Receiving_Invoicing_Branch = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=SPO)
SPO.children.append(Receiving_Invoicing_Branch)

Receive_Goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=Receiving_Invoicing_Branch)
Receive_Invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive Invoice", parent=Receiving_Invoicing_Branch)
Receiving_Invoicing_Branch.children.extend([Receive_Goods, Receive_Invoice])

# Post Receiving and Invoicing Sequence
Post_RI_Sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=Receiving_Invoicing_Branch)
Receiving_Invoicing_Branch.children.append(Post_RI_Sequence)

VRI = ProcessTree(label="Verify Receipt vs Invoice", parent=Post_RI_Sequence)
Invoice_Decision = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=Post_RI_Sequence)
Post_RI_Sequence.children.extend([VRI, Invoice_Decision])

AIP = ProcessTree(label="Approve Invoice for Payment", parent=Invoice_Decision)
DI = ProcessTree(label="Dispute Invoice", parent=Invoice_Decision)
Invoice_Decision.children.extend([AIP, DI])

# Payment Branch (Sequence after Approving Invoice for Payment)
Payment_Branch = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=AIP)
AIP.children.append(Payment_Branch)

PP = ProcessTree(label="Process Payment", parent=Payment_Branch)
CPS = ProcessTree(label="Confirm Payment to Supplier", parent=Payment_Branch)
Payment_Branch.children.extend([PP, CPS])

# Set parents explicitly where not directly set via constructor
for node in [root, PR_Branch, CPR, PR_Decision, Approve_PR, Reject_PR, 
             Ordering_Branch, CPO, SPO, Receiving_Invoicing_Branch, 
             Receive_Goods, Receive_Invoice, Post_RI_Sequence, VRI, 
             Invoice_Decision, AIP, DI, Payment_Branch, PP, CPS]:
    for child in node.children:
        child.parent = node

# Example usage: Convert the process tree to a Petri Net and visualize it
from pm4py.visualization.process_tree import visualizer as pt_visualizer
from pm4py.convert.process_tree import converter as pt_converter
from pm4py.visualization.petrinet import visualizer as pn_visualizer

net, initial_marking, final_marking = pt_converter.apply(root)
process_tree_vis = pt_visualizer.visualize(root)
petri_net_vis = pn_visualizer.visualize(net, initial_marking, final_marking)

# Display or save the visualizations
process_tree_vis.show()
petri_net_vis.show()
```

**Note:**
- This code assumes you have `pm4py` and its dependencies installed. If not, you can install it via pip: `pip install pm4py`.
- The visualization part at the end requires a graphical environment to display the process tree and Petri net.
- The structure of the P2P process is simplified for demonstration purposes. Real-world processes might include additional steps, more complex decision points, or different logical flow structures.
