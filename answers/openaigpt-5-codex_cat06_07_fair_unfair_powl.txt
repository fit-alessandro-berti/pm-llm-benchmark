**Designing POWL models with loops and XOR**

I'm building two POWL models: one with a loop for data completeness followed by a skill assessment, an XOR choice between standard and community checks, then managerial and final decisions; the other simplifies XOR to a single cultural fit check. I'll represent this using pm4py's StrictPartialOrder with transitions and operators, explicitly adding edges for sequencing and describing the loop structure that repeatedly checks data completeness by requesting more info as needed. I'll include code snippets for clarity and explain differences in fairness between the models.

Below are two POWL models capturing GlobalTeq Solutions’ hiring workflow.  
Both include the data-completeness loop and the main sequential stages.  
The first model embeds the unfair XOR branch, while the second eliminates it so that every applicant follows the same cultural fit path.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

receive = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[
        Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck"),
        Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
    ]
)
skill = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[
        Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck"),
        Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
    ]
)

managerial = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

unfair_model = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[receive, data_loop, skill, cultural_xor, managerial, final]
)

unfair_model.order.add_edge(receive, data_loop)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(skill, cultural_xor)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, managerial)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(managerial, final)
```

- The `Operator.LOOP` node captures the “RequestMoreInfo” cycle if data are incomplete.  
- The `Operator.XOR` branch introduces the biased route: candidates taking `CommunityAffiliationCheck` implicitly gain an advantage over those going through the standard `CulturalFitCheck`.

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

receive = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[
        Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck"),
        Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
    ]
)
skill = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

fair_model = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[receive, data_loop, skill, cultural, managerial, final]
)

fair_model.order.add_edge(receive, data_loop)
fair_model.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill)
fair_model.order.add_edge(skill, cultural)
fair_model.order.add_edge(cultural, managerial)
fair_model.order.add_edge(managerial, final)
```

- Everyone goes through the same `CulturalFitCheck`; there is no special community-affiliation branch.
- The rest of the process (loop for completeness, skill test, managerial review, final decision) remains unchanged.

These two models isolate the impact of the biased XOR branching, making it clear where unfairness can enter and how it can be removed.
