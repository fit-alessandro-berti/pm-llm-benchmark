To group these events into separate cases, we'll analyze the sequence of activities, timestamps, and other attributes to identify distinct patient journeys. Here's the process of inferring the case IDs:

1. **Identify unique patient profiles:**
   - We'll use a combination of `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `department` as the primary identifiers for unique patients, as these attributes are consistent across events for the same patient.

2. **Follow the logical sequence of events:**
   - We'll track the progression of activities for each patient, ensuring that the sequence makes sense within the context of a hospital visit.

3. **Assign case IDs:**
   - We'll assign a unique case ID to each distinct patient journey based on the identified patient profiles and the sequence of their events.

Let's go through the events and group them:

### Case 1: 45-year-old Male in ER
- **Patient Profile:** Age 45, Gender M, Department ER

### Summary of Case Groupings:
- **Case 1 (ID: 1):** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
- **Case 2 (ID: 2):** Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- **Case 3 (ID: 3):** Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

Here's the final list of events with inferred case IDs:
