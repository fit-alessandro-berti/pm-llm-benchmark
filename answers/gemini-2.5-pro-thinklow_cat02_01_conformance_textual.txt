Based on the analysis of the normative process description and the provided event log, here is an identification and explanation of the cases that deviate from the intended process flow.

First, let's summarize the key rules derived from the normative description:

*   **Two Valid Paths:**
    1.  **Sufficient Inventory Path (Fulfillment):** `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Package items`  `Ship order`  `Close order`.
    2.  **Insufficient Inventory Path (Cancellation):** `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Cancel order`  `Close order`.
*   **Key Ordering Constraints:**
    *   `Check inventory` must occur *before* `Authorize payment` or any fulfillment activities (`Package items`, `Ship order`).
    *   `Authorize payment` must occur *before* `Package items`.
    *   `Package items` must occur *before* `Ship order`.
*   **Exclusionary Rule:**
    *   If `Cancel order` occurs, then `Authorize payment`, `Package items`, and `Ship order` should not occur. These two paths (fulfillment and cancellation) are mutually exclusive after the `Check inventory` step.
*   **General Rules:**
    *   The process must always start with `Receive order`.
    *   The process must always end with `Close order`.

### Analysis of Cases

The cases that violate the normative process are **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5**. Case 1 and Case 4 are conformant.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the violations for each deviant case:

#### **Case 2: Violation**

*   **Sequence:** `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Package items`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`.
*   **Violation Explanation:**
    This case violates the rule that payment must be authorized *before* items are packaged. The normative description explicitly states, "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'" In this case, `Package items` occurs at 10:00, while `Authorize payment` happens later at 10:30. This is an incorrect ordering of activities, as it represents a business risk (preparing an order for a customer whose payment might be declined).

#### **Case 3: Violation**

*   **Sequence:** `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Cancel order`  `Ship order`  `Close order`.
*   **Violation Explanation:**
    This case contains multiple, severe violations of the process logic.
    1.  **Conflicting Paths:** The process includes activities from both the fulfillment path (`Authorize payment`, `Ship order`) and the cancellation path (`Cancel order`). The normative description makes it clear that these are mutually exclusive scenarios. If an order is canceled (implying insufficient inventory), it is illogical to proceed with fulfillment.
    2.  **Shipping a Canceled Order:** The most significant violation is performing a `Ship order` activity *after* a `Cancel order` activity. The description states, "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)." This sequence represents a major operational failure.
    3.  **Missing `Package items`:** Even if we ignore the cancellation, the sequence `Authorize payment`  `Ship order` is missing the required `Package items` step in between.

#### **Case 5: Violation**

*   **Sequence:** `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`.
*   **Violation Explanation:**
    This case violates the rule that items must be packaged *before* they are shipped. The sequence jumps directly from `Authorize payment` to `Ship order`, completely skipping the `Package items` activity. The normative description is clear on this point: "Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" Shipping an order without packaging is a procedural error that deviates from the expected workflow.

### Summary of Conformant Cases

For completeness, here is why Case 1 and Case 4 are considered correct:

*   **Case 1 (Conformant):** The sequence `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Package items`  `Ship order`  `Close order` perfectly matches the described "Sufficient Inventory Path."
*   **Case 4 (Conformant):** The sequence `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Cancel order`  `Close order` perfectly matches the described "Insufficient Inventory Path."
