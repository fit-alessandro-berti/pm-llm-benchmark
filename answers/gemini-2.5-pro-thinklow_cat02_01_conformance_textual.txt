Based on the analysis of the normative process description and the event log, the following cases deviate from the intended process flow.

**Cases with Violations:**

*   **Case 2**
*   **Case 3**
*   **Case 5**

### **Explanation of Violations**

Here is a detailed breakdown of the violations found in each non-conformant case, with references to the rules derived from the normative process description.

#### **Case 2: Violation of Activity Order**

*   **Sequence:** `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Package items` -> `Authorize payment` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`
*   **Violation:** The activity **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."**
*   **Explanation:** The normative description clearly states the sequence for a successful order: "after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment... Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'" This establishes a strict dependency where payment authorization must be successfully completed *before* the work of packaging begins. Case 2 inverts this critical step, which is a clear violation of the process logic.

#### **Case 3: Multiple Violations (Contradictory Actions)**

*   **Sequence:** `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Authorize payment` -> `Cancel order` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`
*   **Violations:**
    1.  The activity **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."**
    2.  The process path is illogical, mixing activities from the fulfillment and cancellation scenarios.
*   **Explanation:** This case demonstrates two significant deviations.
    1.  The most severe violation is shipping a canceled order. The normative description is explicit on this point: "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)... 'Ship order' should... never after a cancellation." Performing "Ship order" after "Cancel order" directly contradicts this fundamental rule.
    2.  Furthermore, the sequence itself is contradictory. The process first proceeds down the fulfillment path by performing "Authorize payment" but then switches to the cancellation path with "Cancel order." The normative description defines two distinct, mutually exclusive paths after the "Check inventory" step. This case improperly combines them, creating an illogical and inefficient workflow.

#### **Case 5: Violation of a Mandatory Activity**

*   **Sequence:** `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Authorize payment` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`
*   **Violation:** The mandatory activity **"Package items" is missing.**
*   **Explanation:** The normative description for a successfully fulfilled order outlines a specific sequence of required steps. It states, "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" This implies that packaging is a required step that must occur between payment authorization and shipping. Case 5 skips this activity entirely, moving directly from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order," which violates the prescribed process flow.

### **Conformant Cases**

For completeness, the following cases are conformant with the normative process:

*   **Case 1:** Follows the ideal success path precisely: `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Authorize payment` -> `Package items` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`.
*   **Case 4:** Follows the ideal cancellation path precisely: `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Cancel order` -> `Close order`.
