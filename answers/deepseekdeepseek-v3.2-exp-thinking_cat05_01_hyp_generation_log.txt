<think>
We are given an event log for orders and reference tables for orders and resources.
 We are to identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors, hypothesize reasons, and propose SQL queries to investigate.

 Steps:
 1. Understand the normal process flow: 
    Register Order -> Perform Credit Check -> Validate Stock -> Confirm Shipment -> Ship Goods -> Issue Invoice -> Receive Payment.

 2. Look at the example data and identify deviations from the normal flow.

 3. Some potential anomalies from the example data:

    a. Case 1002: 
        - The order is registered, then immediately Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods are done, then Credit Check and Validate Stock.
        - This is out of order. The normal flow expects Credit Check and Validate Stock before Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods.

    b. Case 1003:
        - After Credit Check, the next event is Ship Goods, then Issue Invoice, then Confirm Shipment, then Receive Payment.
        - Confirm Shipment is after Ship Goods, which is out of order (should be before).

    c. Case 1004:
        - After Register Order, the next event is Receive Payment, then Issue Invoice, then Confirm Shipment, then Ship Goods.
        - Receive Payment is happening before Issue Invoice, which is out of order.

 4. Other potential issues:

    - Timing: Check if there are any events that are happening in an illogical order (e.g., payment before invoice, shipment before stock validation, etc.)
    - Missing events: Check if any of the expected events are missing for a case.

 5. We can also look at the resources and departments to see if there are any unauthorized actions (e.g., a Sales person doing a Finance task).

 6. Hypotheses for anomalies:

    a. Process not followed (e.g., steps skipped or done out of order) due to:
        - Urgent orders (like priority orders) might be handled differently?
        - System errors or lack of training.

    b. Data entry errors (e.g., wrong timestamp or activity recorded).

    c. Policy violations (e.g., a resource from the wrong department performing an activity).

 7. We can write SQL queries to:

    a. Check the sequence of activities for each case and compare with the expected sequence.

    b. Check for missing activities in a case.

    c. Check the time between activities to see if there are any illogical time gaps (e.g., negative time between consecutive events).

    d. Check if the resource performing the activity is from the expected department.

 Let's break down the queries we might want to run:

 Query 1: For each case, get the sequence of activities and check if they are in the expected order.

 We can define the expected order by assigning a rank to each activity in the normal flow.

 Expected order (with arbitrary ranks for comparison):

   Register Order: 1
   Perform Credit Check: 2
   Validate Stock: 3
   Confirm Shipment: 4
   Ship Goods: 5
   Issue Invoice: 6
   Receive Payment: 7

 Then, for each case, we can check if the activities are in increasing order of these ranks.

 Query 2: Check for missing activities.

 Query 3: Check for negative time between consecutive events in a case.

 Query 4: Check if the resource's department is allowed to perform the activity.

   We can define which department is allowed for which activity. For example:

   - Register Order: Sales
   - Perform Credit Check: Finance
   - Validate Stock: Logistics
   - Confirm Shipment: Logistics
   - Ship Goods: Logistics
   - Issue Invoice: Finance
   - Receive Payment: Finance

   Then, we can join the event log with the resources table and check if the department of the resource matches the expected department for the activity.

 Query 5: Check if there are any duplicate events (e.g., two 'Register Order' for the same case).

 Let's write the queries accordingly.

 Note: Since we are to propose SQL queries without hints, we will write them in a way that can be run on the given schema.

 We assume that the event log has one row per event per case, and events are ordered by timestamp within a case.

 We will use window functions to get the previous and next events for timing and sequence checks.

 Let's start with:

 Query 1: Check for out-of-order activities.

 We can assign the expected order for each activity and then check if the sequence in the case is non-decreasing.

 However, note that the same activity might appear multiple times? But in the example, each activity appears once per case.

 But to be safe, we can use the timestamp to order the events and then check the sequence of activities.

 Alternatively, we can define the expected order by the minimum timestamp of the activity in the normal process? Not exactly.

 We can use a common table expression (CTE) to assign a rank to each activity in the normal flow and then, for each case, check the order of the activities by their timestamp and see if the assigned ranks are in increasing order.

 But note: the normal flow is a total order, so we can assign:

   activity_rank = 
      CASE activity
        WHEN 'Register Order' THEN 1
        WHEN 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
        WHEN 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
        WHEN 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
        WHEN 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
        WHEN 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
        WHEN 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
        ELSE 8
      END

 Then, for each case, we can check the sequence of activity_rank by the timestamp. If we find a decrease, then it's an anomaly.

 Query 2: Check for missing activities.

 We can check for each case, which of the expected activities are missing.

 Query 3: Check for negative time between consecutive events.

 We can use LAG or LEAD to get the previous/next timestamp and then compute the difference.

 Query 4: Check resource department against expected department for the activity.

 We can create a mapping table for activity and expected department, then join with the event log and resources.

 Query 5: Check for duplicate activities (same activity occurring multiple times in a case) that are not expected.

 Let's write these queries one by one.

 However, note that the problem says "without any hints or guidance provided here", so we are to come up with the queries on our own.

 We are to propose SQL queries to investigate the hypotheses.

 We'll write the queries in PostgreSQL.

 Let's start with Query 1: Out-of-order activities.

 Step 1: Assign a rank to each activity in the normal flow.

 We'll create a CTE for the event log with the activity_rank and then use window functions to check the order.

 We want to check, for each case, when we order by timestamp, the activity_rank should be non-decreasing.

 If we find a case where the activity_rank is less than the previous activity_rank (by timestamp), then it's out of order.

 Query 1:

 WITH event_ranks AS (
   SELECT 
     case_id,
     event_id,
     activity,
     timestamp,
     resource,
     additional_info,
     CASE activity
        WHEN 'Register Order' THEN 1
        WHEN 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
        WHEN 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
        WHEN 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
        WHEN 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
        WHEN 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
        WHEN 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
        ELSE 8
     END AS activity_rank
   FROM order_event_log
 ),
 ordered_events AS (
   SELECT 
     *,
     LAG(activity_rank) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_rank
   FROM event_ranks
 )
 SELECT 
   case_id,
   event_id,
   activity,
   timestamp,
   activity_rank,
   prev_rank
 FROM ordered_events
 WHERE prev_rank IS NOT NULL AND activity_rank < prev_rank
 ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

 This query will return events that are out of order (i.e., the current activity_rank is less than the previous one).

 Now, Query 2: Missing activities.

 We can check for each case, which of the 7 activities are missing.

 We can do this by:

   WITH expected_activities AS (
     SELECT unnest(ARRAY['Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment']) AS activity
   ),
   cases AS (
     SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log
   )
   SELECT 
     c.case_id,
     ea.activity
   FROM cases c
   CROSS JOIN expected_activities ea
   LEFT JOIN order_event_log oel 
     ON c.case_id = oel.case_id AND oel.activity = ea.activity
   WHERE oel.event_id IS NULL;

 This will list for each case, which expected activity is missing.

 Query 3: Negative time between consecutive events.

   WITH event_sequence AS (
     SELECT 
       case_id,
       event_id,
       activity,
       timestamp,
       LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp
     FROM order_event_log
   )
   SELECT 
     case_id,
     event_id,
     activity,
     timestamp,
     prev_timestamp,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - prev_timestamp)) AS seconds_diff
   FROM event_sequence
   WHERE prev_timestamp IS NOT NULL AND timestamp < prev_timestamp;

 This will return events that have a timestamp earlier than the previous event in the same case.

 Query 4: Check resource department.

   We need a mapping of activity to expected department. Let's create a CTE for that.

   WITH activity_department AS (
     SELECT 
       unnest(ARRAY['Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment']) AS activity,
       unnest(ARRAY['Sales', 'Finance', 'Logistics', 'Logistics', 'Logistics', 'Finance', 'Finance']) AS expected_department
   )
   SELECT 
     oel.case_id,
     oel.event_id,
     oel.activity,
     oel.resource,
     r.department AS actual_department,
     ad.expected_department
   FROM order_event_log oel
   JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
   JOIN activity_department ad ON oel.activity = ad.activity
   WHERE r.department <> ad.expected_department;

 This will return events where the resource's department does not match the expected department for the activity.

 Query 5: Duplicate activities.

   We can check for cases that have the same activity more than once.

   SELECT 
     case_id,
     activity,
     COUNT(*) AS count
   FROM order_event_log
   GROUP BY case_id, activity
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

 These queries will help identify the anomalies we observed in the example data.

 However, note that the example data has cases that are out of order and also missing activities (like case 1004 is missing 'Validate Stock' and 'Perform Credit Check').

 Let's run these queries on the example data to see if they capture the anomalies.

 But note: the example data is just a sample, and we are to propose these queries for the actual database.

 We are to encourage the target model to identify anomalies and then use these queries to investigate.

 We have provided 5 queries for different types of anomalies.

 Let's now present the response in the required format.
</think>
Looking at this event log data, I can identify several anomalies and deviations from the expected process flow. Let me analyze these issues and propose SQL queries to investigate them further.

## Identified Anomalies and Hypotheses

### 1. **Process Flow Violations**

**Observations:**
- Case 1002: Shipment confirmed and shipped BEFORE credit check and stock validation
- Case 1003: Goods shipped BEFORE shipment confirmation
- Case 1004: Payment received BEFORE invoice issuance and without credit check/stock validation

**Hypotheses:**
- Priority orders may bypass normal checks (1002 was priority type)
- System errors in workflow sequencing
- Manual overrides by staff
- Training gaps on proper process sequence

### 2. **Missing Process Steps**

**Observations:**
- Case 1004: Missing "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock" entirely
- Case 1003: Missing "Validate Stock" step

**Hypotheses:**
- Expedited processing for high-value orders (1004 had $3000 value)
- System integration failures between departments
- Data entry errors in logging

### 3. **Resource Role Violations**

**Observations:**
- Warehouse staff performing shipment confirmations (should be Logistics Manager role)
- Potential cross-department activities

**Hypotheses:**
- Staff working outside their authorized roles
- Resource shortages leading to role blending
- Inadequate access controls

## Proposed SQL Queries for Investigation

### Query 1: Process Sequence Analysis
```sql
WITH event_sequence AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as previous_activity,
        LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as previous_timestamp
    FROM order_event_log
),
sequence_violations AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        previous_activity,
        timestamp,
        previous_timestamp
    FROM event_sequence
    WHERE (previous_activity = 'Ship Goods' AND activity = 'Confirm Shipment')
       OR (previous_activity = 'Receive Payment' AND activity = 'Issue Invoice')
       OR (previous_activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND activity IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock'))
)
SELECT sv.*, o.order_type, o.order_value
FROM sequence_violations sv
LEFT JOIN orders o ON sv.case_id = o.case_id
ORDER BY sv.case_id, sv.timestamp;
```

### Query 2: Missing Mandatory Process Steps
```sql
WITH case_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 END) as has_credit_check,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 END) as has_stock_validation,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 1 END) as has_invoice,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 1 END) as has_payment
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT 
    ca.case_id,
    o.order_type,
    o.order_value,
    CASE WHEN ca.has_credit_check = 0 THEN 'MISSING' ELSE 'PRESENT' END as credit_check_status,
    CASE WHEN ca.has_stock_validation = 0 THEN 'MISSING' ELSE 'PRESENT' END as stock_validation_status,
    CASE WHEN ca.has_invoice = 0 THEN 'MISSING' ELSE 'PRESENT' END as invoice_status,
    CASE WHEN ca.has_payment = 0 THEN 'MISSING' ELSE 'PRESENT' END as payment_status
FROM case_activities ca
JOIN orders o ON ca.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE ca.has_credit_check = 0 
   OR ca.has_stock_validation = 0
   OR ca.has_invoice = 0
   OR ca.has_payment = 0;
```

### Query 3: Resource Role Compliance Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    oel.case_id,
    oel.activity,
    oel.resource,
    r.role,
    r.department,
    CASE 
        WHEN oel.activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods') AND r.department != 'Logistics' THEN 'ROLE_VIOLATION'
        WHEN oel.activity IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment') AND r.department != 'Finance' THEN 'ROLE_VIOLATION'
        WHEN oel.activity = 'Register Order' AND r.department != 'Sales' THEN 'ROLE_VIOLATION'
        ELSE 'COMPLIANT'
    END as compliance_status
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE CASE 
        WHEN oel.activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods') AND r.department != 'Logistics' THEN 'ROLE_VIOLATION'
        WHEN oel.activity IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment') AND r.department != 'Finance' THEN 'ROLE_VIOLATION'
        WHEN oel.activity = 'Register Order' AND r.department != 'Sales' THEN 'ROLE_VIOLATION'
        ELSE 'COMPLIANT'
    END = 'ROLE_VIOLATION'
ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.timestamp;
```

### Query 4: Process Duration Analysis by Order Type
```sql
WITH process_times AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        MIN(timestamp) as process_start,
        MAX(timestamp) as process_end,
        MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) as total_duration
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
anomalous_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        pt.case_id,
        pt.total_duration,
        o.order_type,
        o.order_value,
        COUNT(oel.event_id) as total_events,
        CASE 
            WHEN pt.total_duration < INTERVAL '1 hour' THEN 'TOO_FAST'
            WHEN pt.total_duration > INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 'TOO_SLOW'
            ELSE 'NORMAL'
        END as duration_category
    FROM process_times pt
    JOIN orders o ON pt.case_id = o.case_id
    JOIN order_event_log oel ON pt.case_id = oel.case_id
    GROUP BY pt.case_id, pt.total_duration, o.order_type, o.order_value
)
SELECT *
FROM anomalous_cases
WHERE duration_category IN ('TOO_FAST', 'TOO_SLOW')
ORDER BY total_duration DESC;
```

### Query 5: Payment Before Invoice Analysis
```sql
WITH payment_invoice_timing AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) as invoice_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) as payment_time
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
       AND MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    pit.case_id,
    pit.invoice_time,
    pit.payment_time,
    CASE 
        WHEN pit.payment_time < pit.invoice_time THEN 'PAYMENT_BEFORE_INVOICE'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as timing_issue,
    o.order_type,
    o.order_value,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (pit.payment_time - pit.invoice_time))/3600 as hours_between_invoice_payment
FROM payment_invoice_timing pit
JOIN orders o ON pit.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE pit.payment_time < pit.invoice_time
   OR ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (pit.payment_time - pit.invoice_time))/3600) < 1  -- Less than 1 hour between
ORDER BY hours_between_invoice_payment;
```

### Query 6: Cross-Department Process Flow Analysis
```sql
WITH department_flow AS (
    SELECT 
        oel.case_id,
        oel.activity,
        oel.timestamp,
        r.department,
        LAG(r.department) OVER (PARTITION BY oel.case_id ORDER BY oel.timestamp) as previous_department,
        LAG(oel.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY oel.case_id ORDER BY oel.timestamp) as previous_activity
    FROM order_event_log oel
    JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
)
SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    department,
    previous_activity,
    previous_department,
    timestamp
FROM department_flow
WHERE previous_department IS NOT NULL 
  AND department != previous_department
  AND (
      (previous_department = 'Logistics' AND department = 'Finance' AND activity != 'Issue Invoice')
      OR (previous_department = 'Finance' AND department = 'Logistics')
      OR (previous_department = 'Sales' AND department NOT IN ('Finance', 'Logistics'))
  )
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

These queries will help identify systematic issues in the order fulfillment process, including process violations, missing steps, role compliance issues, and timing anomalies that could indicate deeper operational problems.
