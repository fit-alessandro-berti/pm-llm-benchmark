# 20 Thought-Provoking Questions About the Supply Chain Process

1. **How does the company mitigate supply chain disruptions when a single critical component (such as microprocessors from Taiwan) faces geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or manufacturing delays?**

2. **What strategies could be implemented to balance the trade-offs between just-in-time inventory management and maintaining buffer stock to handle unexpected demand spikes or supply shortages?**

3. **How does the organization measure and ensure consistency in quality standards across components sourced from multiple countries with different manufacturing practices and regulations?**

4. **What are the hidden costs and risks associated with operating assembly plants 24/7, and how might the company optimize shift patterns to balance productivity, worker wellbeing, and operational expenses?**

5. **How should the company prioritize which markets receive air freight versus cargo ship delivery when balancing speed-to-market against transportation costs and carbon footprint reduction goals?**

13. **How might blockchain technology or other emerging digital solutions improve transparency, traceability, and trust across this complex multi-party supply chain network?**

14. **What are the implications of concentrating assembly in a single Malaysian facility versus distributing manufacturing across multiple regions closer to end markets?**

15. **How should the company structure its after-sales support and warranty services to handle regional differences in consumer expectations, legal requirements, and product usage patterns?**

16. **What early warning indicators could help the company anticipate when a supplier is at risk of quality issues, financial distress, or capacity constraints before they impact production?**

17. **How can the organization balance the need for standardized global processes with the flexibility to adapt to local market requirements, regulations, and consumer preferences?**

18. **What investment priorities would yield the greatest return in reducing total supply chain lead times—supplier relationship development, transportation infrastructure, manufacturing automation, or digital system integration?**

19. **How should the company approach capacity planning for new product launches when historical sales data may not reflect demand for innovative features or changing market conditions?**

20. **What governance structures and key performance indicators would best align the interests of R&D teams, procurement specialists, manufacturing operations, logistics partners, and sales organizations in this complex ecosystem?**
