### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - **Observation:** The average time is 25 hours (90,000 seconds) with a very low standard deviation (1 hour or 3,600 seconds).  
   - **Anomaly:** Such a narrow standard deviation suggests a rigid or automated process with little variation. This could indicate artificial scheduling or a systemic issue.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - **Observation:** The average delay is 7 days (604,800 seconds) with a high standard deviation of 2 days (172,800 seconds).  
   - **Anomaly:** The wide variability implies inconsistent process execution. This could result from resource constraints, backlogs, or ad-hoc prioritization.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**  
   - **Observation:** The average time is only 2 hours (7,200 seconds) with a standard deviation of 1 hour (3,600 seconds).  
   - **Anomaly:** The rapid closure after assignment raises concerns about skipped steps like evaluation or approval, suggesting incomplete claim handling.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - **Observation:** The average time is just 5 minutes (300 seconds) with a very low standard deviation of 1 minute (60 seconds).  
   - **Anomaly:** Such quick transitions might indicate that notifications are automated and triggered immediately after evaluation, potentially bypassing other steps.

### Hypotheses for the Observed Anomalies

1. **Rigid Timing (R to P):**  
   - Automated scheduling of approvals could enforce a fixed time frame between claim receipt and approval.
   - This may ignore actual workload or complexity of claims.

2. **Delays and Variability (P to N):**  
   - Notifications might depend on external dependencies or manual actions, causing long delays.
   - High variability could reflect inconsistent prioritization or resource allocation issues.

3. **Premature Closures (A to C):**  
   - Claims might be closed without proper evaluation or approval, potentially due to system errors or performance incentives for faster resolution.
   - Certain types of claims may have predefined criteria allowing them to bypass intermediate steps.

4. **Automated Transitions (E to N):**  
   - Notifications being sent immediately after evaluation could indicate automation that doesnâ€™t consider approvals or other dependencies.
   - This could lead to errors in notifying customers about incomplete evaluations.

### SQL Queries for Verification

1. **Identify Claims with Anomalous Timing Between Activities**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp) AS time_diff
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE time_diff NOT BETWEEN (AVG_TIME - 3 * STDEV_TIME) AND (AVG_TIME + 3 * STDEV_TIME);
   ```
   Replace `AVG_TIME` and `STDEV_TIME` with values from the temporal profile for specific activity pairs (e.g., 'R' to 'P').

2. **Analyze Rigid Scheduling Between Receive and Approve**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, ce1.timestamp AS receive_time, ce2.timestamp AS approve_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) BETWEEN 86400 AND 108000; -- Narrow range to verify rigid timing
   ```

3. **Check Variability in Approve to Notify**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS approve_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) NOT BETWEEN 432000 AND 777600; -- Outside expected range of 5 to 9 days
   ```

4. **Investigate Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS assign_time, ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) < 3600; -- Less than 1 hour
   ```

5. **Identify Rapid Evaluation-to-Notification Transitions**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) < 240; -- Less than 4 minutes
   ```

These queries can help isolate anomalies, uncover patterns in their occurrence, and correlate them with claims, adjusters, or regions for further analysis.
