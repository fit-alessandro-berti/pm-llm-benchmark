We are given two logs: Log A and Log B.
 Log A: has timestamp (in Zulu time), event_type, order_id.
 Log B: has timestamp (Zulu time), event_name, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes.

 Steps:
 1. We note that Log A is the primary timeline, but timestamps in Log A are when events are received (not necessarily when they started). 
    However, the problem says to use the primary timestamp from Log A for the merged timeline.

 2. We are to match events based on order_id and event timing (with a tolerance of 2 seconds). Also, note that event names may differ.

 3. We will create a merged log that includes:
    - All events from Log A and Log B that can be matched (with the same order_id and timestamps within 2 seconds) will be merged.
    - Events that cannot be matched will be included as-is (with an indicator of origin).

 4. We must also consider that Log B might have events that are not in Log A and vice versa.

 5. We will use the timestamp from Log A as the primary for ordering the final log. However, when merging, if two events have the same order_id and are close in time (within 2 seconds), we merge them.

 6. But note: the events in the example have distinct event types and names. We must match by order_id and then by timing? Also, note that the same order might have multiple events.

 7. Approach:
    - We will align events by order_id. For each order, we will look at the events in Log A and Log B and try to match two events (from A and B) that have the same order_id and are within 2 seconds of each other.

    However, note: an order might have multiple events. We are not matching the same event type in both logs? We are matching by the same order and then by proximity in time.

    But the problem says: "If two events appear to represent the same occurrence". How do we know? We are told to use order_id and timing.

    So for each order, we can:
        a. Collect all events (from both logs) for that order.
        b. Sort them by timestamp (in Log A events and Log B events separately) and then try to match events that are within 2 seconds and have the same order_id.

    However, note: the same event type might appear in both logs? But the example shows different event names.

    Example: 
        Log A has: 
            Order Received, Order#1234 at 10:00:00
            Order Validated at 10:01:30
            ... etc.

        Log B has:
            OrderReceived at 9:59:58 (same order) -> we can match this as the same event as Log A's Order Received? But note the timestamps are 1 second apart? Actually, 10:00:00 - 9:59:58 = 2 seconds? 
            Actually, 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z minus 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z is 2 seconds? So within tolerance.

    So we can match OrderReceived in Log B with the Order Received in Log A? But note the event names are slightly different: "OrderReceived" vs "Order Received". The problem says event naming conventions may differ.

    Therefore, we are matching solely by order_id and time? But wait, the problem says: "If two events appear to represent the same occurrence", and we are given order_id and time. So we assume that the same order_id and time proximity is the best indicator.

    However, what if the same order has two events in one log and one in the other? We have to be cautious.

 8. Plan for each order:
    - We have a list of events from Log A (with event_type and timestamp) and from Log B (with event_name and timestamp) for that order.

    We want to merge two events (one from A and one from B) if:
        - They have the same order_id (which they do by the same order#)
        - Their timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds.

    But note: we might have multiple events in Log A and multiple in Log B for the same order? We are to merge one from A with one from B? But what if there are two events in Log A and two in Log B? How to match?

    The problem says: "merge corresponding events". We are not told that each event in Log A must be matched with exactly one in Log B? But the example orders have one event in Log A and one (or more?) in Log B? Actually, the example order#1234 has 4 events in Log A and 4 events in Log B? Let's count:

        Log A: 5 events? Actually, the example Log A has 5 events? But the order#1234 appears 4 times? Actually, the example Log A has 5 lines? But the order_id is the same for the first four? The last one is also Order#1234? Actually, the example Log A has 5 events all for order#1234? 

        Log B: 4 events for order#1234? 

    So we have 4 events in common? Then we should merge the 4 events that can be matched by order_id and time? But note: the timestamps in Log A are:

        10:00:00 -> Order Received
        10:01:30 -> Order Validated
        10:02:00 -> Payment Processed
        10:05:00 -> Item Shipped
        10:20:00 -> Item Delivered

    Log B:

        10:01:29 -> OrderValidation (matches Order Validated? 10:01:30 in A and 10:01:29 in B -> difference 1 second -> match)
        10:02:05 -> Quality Check? doesn't match Payment Processed (which is 10:02:00) -> 5 seconds difference -> within 2 seconds? so we could match? but wait, the event names are different? but the problem says to match by order_id and time? So we would match? But then we have two events in Log B for the same time period? 

    However, note: the problem says "If two events appear to represent the same occurrence". We are not told that the same event type in different logs must be the same? We are told to use order_id and time. So we match by order_id and time regardless of event name? 

    But then we have:

        Log A: 10:02:00 -> Payment Processed
        Log B: 10:02:05 -> Quality Check

    They are within 2 seconds? So we merge them? Then the merged event would have:
        timestamp: we can take the earliest? or the Log A timestamp? or the Log B? The problem says: "If timestamps differ slightly, you can select one as primary or include both". Since Log A is primary, we might take the Log A timestamp? But note: the merged event should have attributes from both? So we need both timestamps? 

    However, the requirement says: "Include all attributes from both logs for merged events. If timestamps differ slightly, you can select one as primary or include both."

    We decide: we will keep both timestamps? But the final log is a single event. How? We can have two timestamps? Or we choose one? The problem says "choose one". Since Log A is primary, we choose the Log A timestamp as the primary for the event. But we can also note the Log B timestamp? 

    Alternatively, we can record the earliest timestamp? But the problem says to order by a chosen primary timestamp (which is from Log A). So we use the Log A timestamp for ordering.

    However, the problem also says: "Present events in chronological order (based on a chosen primary timestamp)". So we use the Log A timestamp for the chronological order.

    Therefore, for each merged event, we will have:
        - The Log A timestamp as the primary timestamp (for ordering and as the event time)
        - The Log B timestamp if we want to include it? But the problem says "include both" if we want? But note: the merged event is one record. We can have two timestamps? It might be confusing.

    Let me re-read: "If timestamps differ slightly, you can select one as primary or include both." -> We can choose to include both? But then we have two timestamps? How about we store the Log A timestamp and the Log B timestamp? And we use the Log A timestamp for ordering? 

    Alternatively, we can store one timestamp? The problem says "choose one". We'll choose the Log A timestamp as the primary. But we are also allowed to include both? The problem doesn't specify the structure of the merged event.

    We decide to create a merged event record that has:
        - The timestamp from Log A (as the primary timestamp for ordering and representing the event time)
        - The event name from Log B? But note: the event type in Log A and the event name in Log B might be different. We are told to combine attributes. So we can have:
            timestamp: from Log A (primary) and also note the Log B timestamp? 
            event_type: from Log A? or we can create a unified event type? But the problem doesn't say to rename. We are to combine attributes.

        We are to include all attributes? So:

        Merged event will have:
            timestamp (from Log A, as primary) 
            event_type (from Log A) 
            order_id (from both)
            user_id (from Log B if present)
            resource_id (from Log B if present)
            notes (from Log B if present)
            and we also want to include the event name from Log B? But note: the event name in Log B is a string that might describe the event. We can add a field? The problem doesn't specify the output format.

    However, the problem says: "Produce a merged event log" and the example logs are in CSV-like format. We must define the columns.

    We are to output a list of merged events. Each event should have:

        timestamp (from Log A, in the same format as Log A, but we might have to convert to a common format? but both are in Zulu time and ISO format? so we can keep as string? but note: we are matching by time, so we must parse? but the problem says to present in chronological order? so we can sort by the Log A timestamp? 

    Steps for merging:

        Step 1: Parse the logs into a list of events. For Log A, each event is (timestamp, event_type, order_id). For Log B, each event is (timestamp, event_name, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes).

        Step 2: For each order, we want to collect events by order_id. We'll create a dictionary: 
            orders = {}
            keys: order_id, then value: a list of events for that order. Each event is a tuple: (original_timestamp, type_or_name, origin_log, additional_attributes) 
            But we need to distinguish Log A and Log B? Because we want to match by order_id and time? And when merging we want to know which log the event came from? 

        Alternatively, we can do:

            events = []
            for log in [LogA, LogB]:
                for each event in log:
                    events.append( (parse_timestamp(event[0]), event[1], event[2], log_source) ) 
                but we don't need the log_source for matching? we are matching by order_id and time? 

        But note: we are matching one event from Log A with one event from Log B? But what if an order has two events in Log A and two in Log B? Then we have to match each event in Log A with one event in Log B? 

        How? We can try to match each event in Log A with every event in Log B for the same order? Then if we find one within 2 seconds, we merge? But what if two events in Log A are close? We might match the same Log B event twice? 

        We need a bipartite matching? But the problem doesn't specify that. And the example doesn't have that complexity. 

        Given the example, each order has one event in Log A and one event in Log B? Actually, the example has 4 events for order#1234 in both logs? So we have 4 events in Log A and 4 in Log B? We are to match each Log A event with a Log B event? 

        But note: the problem says "merge corresponding events". We are not told how to match when there are multiple. We'll assume that we are to match events that have the same order_id and are within 2 seconds? and then if two events from A and two from B are within the time window, we match arbitrarily? or by the order of the events? 

        We can do:

            For a given order, sort the events by timestamp? Then try to match the events in Log A and Log B in order? 

        However, the timestamps in Log A and Log B for the same order might be interleaved? 

        Example for order#1234:

            Log A: 
                10:00:00 -> Order Received
                10:01:30 -> Order Validated
                10:02:00 -> Payment Processed
                10:05:00 -> Item Shipped
                10:20:00 -> Item Delivered

            Log B:
                10:01:29 -> OrderValidation
                10:02:05 -> Quality Check
                10:03:00 -> Shipping

            We have 5 events in Log A and 3 in Log B? 

        We want to match each Log B event to a Log A event that is within 2 seconds? 

        How to match? We can try to match the earliest Log B event to the earliest Log A event that is within 2 seconds? 

        Algorithm for one order:

            events_A = sorted list of (timestamp, event_type) for Log A for this order.
            events_B = sorted list of (timestamp, event_name) for Log B for this order.

            We want to avoid matching one event in B to two in A? So we can do:

            matches = []
            # We'll traverse events_B and for each event_B, we'll look for an event_A that is within 2 seconds and not yet matched? 
            # But note: we might have multiple in A and B? We can do a greedy matching: sort both and then traverse? 

            Alternatively, we can create a list of candidate matches: for each event_B, we can have a window of events_A that are in [timestamp_B - 2 seconds, timestamp_B + 2 seconds]. Then we pick the first one? But which one? 

            Since the problem says "if you cannot confidently match", we can do:

                For each event_B, we look for an event_A that is within 2 seconds and that hasn't been matched? and we pick the closest? 

            We'll do:

                matches = []   # list of (event_A, event_B)
                unmatched_A = events_A[:]   # we'll remove as we match
                unmatched_B = events_B[:]

                while unmatched_B:
                    b = unmatched_B[0]
                    # find all unmatched_A that are within [b_time - 2, b_time + 2]
                    candidates = [a for a in unmatched_A if abs(a[0] - b[0]) <= 2]   # in seconds
                    if candidates:
                        # pick the candidate that is the earliest? or the latest? 
                        # We can pick the candidate that is the earliest? 
                        candidate = min(candidates, key=lambda x: x[0])
                        # then we match candidate (from A) with b (from B)
                        matches.append((candidate, b))
                        unmatched_A.remove(candidate)
                        unmatched_B.remove(b)   # we remove the first element? but we have to remove the exact one? 
                        # But note: we are using the list and we remove by value? but the same timestamp might appear twice? 
                    else:
                        # no match for this event_B -> leave it unmatched
                        unmatched_B.remove(b)   # but we already took the first? so we break?
                        break   # actually, we break the while? but we are in the middle of the list? 

                Actually, we are removing the first element of unmatched_B at the beginning of the loop? Then we break if no candidate? 

            But this greedy might not be optimal? 

        Alternatively, we can do one pass: sort both events_A and events_B by time. Then traverse both and try to match events that are within 2 seconds? 

        We can do:

            i = j = 0
            matches = []
            while i < len(events_A) and j < len(events_B):
                if events_A[i][0] is within [events_B[j][0]-2, events_B[j][0]+2]:
                    # match them
                    matches.append( (events_A[i], events_B[j]) )
                    i += 1
                    j += 1
                elif events_A[i][0] < events_B[j][0] - 2:
                    # event_A is too early? then we skip this event_A because it's before the current event_B by more than 2 seconds
                    i += 1
                else:
                    # event_B is too early? then we skip this event_B
                    j += 1

        But this is a standard two-pointer for two sorted lists? 

        However, note: what if we have:

            events_A: [10:00, 10:01, 10:02]
            events_B: [10:01:30, 10:03]

        Then we might match:

            A:10:00 -> B:10:01:30? (if 10:00 is within 2 seconds of 10:01:30? no, 162 seconds? so not) 
            Then we move? 

        Actually, we need to check: 

            We want to match events that are within 2 seconds? 

        We can do:

            i = j = 0
            matches = []
            while i < len(events_A) and j < len(events_B):
                a = events_A[i]
                b = events_B[j]
                if a[0] >= b[0] - 2 and a[0] <= b[0] + 2:
                    matches.append( (a, b) )
                    i += 1
                    j += 1
                elif a[0] < b[0] - 2:
                    i += 1
                else:
                    j += 1

        But note: what if we have:

            A: [10:00, 10:02]
            B: [10:01, 10:03]

        Then:

            i=0, j=0: a=10:00, b=10:01 -> within 2 seconds? yes -> match -> then i=1, j=1
            then a=10:02, b=10:03 -> within 2 seconds? yes -> match.

        That works.

        But what if:

            A: [10:00, 10:03]
            B: [10:01, 10:04]

        Then:

            i=0, j=0: 10:00 and 10:01 -> match -> i=1, j=1
            then a=10:03, b=10:04 -> 10:03 is within [10:04-2, 10:04+2] -> [10:02, 10:06] -> 10:03 is in -> match.

        But what if:

            A: [10:00, 10:01]
            B: [10:03, 10:04]

        Then:

            i=0, j=0: 10:00 and 10:03 -> 10:00 < 10:03-2 (10:01) -> so i++ -> i=1
            then a=10:01, j=0: 10:01 < 10:03-2? 10:03-2=10:01 -> so 10:01 is not < 10:01? it's equal -> so condition: 10:01 >= 10:01 -> so we check the other condition: 10:01 <= 10:03+2 -> yes -> so match? 
            But 10:01 and 10:03: difference is 2 seconds? so within tolerance? -> match.

        So the algorithm:

            events_A_sorted = sorted(events_A, key=lambda x: x[0])
            events_B_sorted = sorted(events_B, key=lambda x: x[0])

            i = j = 0
            matches = []
            while i < len(events_A_sorted) and j < len(events_B_sorted):
                a_time = events_A_sorted[i][0]
                b_time = events_B_sorted[j][0]
                if a_time >= b_time - 2 and a_time <= b_time + 2:
                    # within 2 seconds? note: the condition above is equivalent to abs(a_time - b_time) <= 2? 
                    matches.append( (events_A_sorted[i], events_B_sorted[j]) )
                    i += 1
                    j += 1
                elif a_time < b_time - 2:
                    i += 1
                else:   # a_time > b_time + 2
                    j += 1

        But note: the condition can be written as: abs(a_time - b_time) <= 2? 

        However, the condition in the if statement is: 
            a_time >= b_time-2 and a_time <= b_time+2 -> that is the same as abs(a_time - b_time) <= 2? 

        But note: if a_time is 10:00 and b_time is 10:02, then difference is 2 seconds -> match.

        So we use that.

        Step 3: After matching, we have:
            For each match, we create a merged event that has:
                timestamp: we take the Log A timestamp? (because Log A is primary) -> but we want to store both? 
                event_type: from Log A? 
                event_name: from Log B? because the problem says to combine? but note: the event type in Log A and event name in Log B are different? 
                But the problem says "combine their attributes". We are not told to rename event_type? 

            We decide: 
                merged_event = {
                    timestamp: events_A_sorted[i][0]   # the Log A timestamp
                    event_type: events_A_sorted[i][1]   # from Log A
                    order_id: events_A_sorted[i][2]     # same as events_B_sorted[j][2]
                    user_id: events_B_sorted[j][3]      # if present in Log B? 
                    resource_id: events_B_sorted[j][4]  # if present?
                    notes: events_B_sorted[j][5]         # if present?
                    # and we also want to note the Log B timestamp? 
                    event_time_logB: events_B_sorted[j][0]   # the Log B timestamp? 
                }

            But note: the Log B event might have an event name? we are not including that as a separate field? because we have event_type? 
            But the event_type and event_name are different? We can add a field 'event_name' from Log B? 

            Alternatively, we can create a unified event_type? But the problem doesn't say to rename. 

            We decide to add a field 'event_detail' that combines the event_type and event_name? Or we can just leave the event_type and event_name separately? 

            The problem says: "merge corresponding events into unified records". So we are merging the attributes? 

            We can have:

                event_type: from Log A? and then the event_name from Log B as a separate field? 

            But the example output format? The problem doesn't specify. We'll output a CSV-like format? 

            We must define the columns. Let's include:

                timestamp, event_type, order_id, event_name (from Log B?), user_id (from Log B), resource_id (from Log B), notes (from Log B), and also note the Log B timestamp? 

            But the Log B timestamp is the same as the event time? but from a different system? 

            Alternatively, we can just store the Log A timestamp as the primary timestamp and then the Log B timestamp as an additional timestamp? 

            However, the problem says: "Include all attributes from both logs for merged events". So we want to include:

                - Log A: event_type, order_id, and the timestamp (as the primary)
                - Log B: event_name, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes, and the timestamp (if we are including it? but note: the timestamp in Log B is also a timestamp? and we are using Log A as primary? 

            We decide:

                We'll have:
                    timestamp: from Log A (the primary)
                    event_type: from Log A
                    order_id: from both
                    event_name: from Log B? (we can call it 'event_name' or 'event_detail'? but the problem says to combine? we'll call it 'event_name' and note that it comes from Log B? 
                    user_id: from Log B if present? 
                    resource_id: from Log B if present?
                    notes: from Log B if present?
                    event_timestamp: from Log B? (so we have two timestamps: one from A and one from B? but the problem says to include both? 

            But note: the problem says "If timestamps differ slightly, you can select one as primary or include both". We are already using Log A as primary? so we can include both? 

            So we add a field: event_timestamp (from Log B)

        Step 4: Events that are not matched by any event in the other log? We leave them as is? with an indicator? 

        We can add a field 'origin' that says "LogA" or "LogB"? 

        But note: events from Log A that are not matched by Log B: we want to include them? 
        Similarly, events from Log B that are not matched by Log A.

        So for unmatched events:

            We create a merged event that has:
                timestamp: the event's timestamp from the original log (but we are using Log A as primary? so for LogA unmatched: we use the Log A timestamp? for LogB unmatched: we use the Log B timestamp? 
                However, the problem says Log A is the primary timeline? so unmatched events from Log A should be included with their Log A timestamp? 
                But what about unmatched events from Log B? They are not part of the primary timeline? but we are to include them? 

            We decide:

                For unmatched events from Log A: 
                    We include them with the order_id and the event_type and the timestamp (from Log A) and the origin? 

                For unmatched events from Log B:
                    We include them with the order_id and then the event details? but we don't have a timestamp from Log A? so we use the Log B timestamp? but then we are introducing a new timeline? 

            However, the problem says: "Present events in chronological order (based on a chosen primary timestamp)". The primary timestamp is the Log A timestamp? 

            So for unmatched events from Log B, we don't have a Log A timestamp? so we cannot order them? 

            But note: we are told to include events that are not matched? So we must include them? 

            How? We can assign a timestamp of 0? or a very early time? but that would mess up the order? 

            Alternatively, we can use the Log B timestamp? and then note that they are unmatched? 

            But the problem says: the primary timeline is Log A? So unmatched events from Log B are not in the primary timeline? 

            We decide: 

                We will assign a timestamp for unmatched Log B events as the Log B timestamp? and then we will use that timestamp for ordering? but note: the primary timestamp for the entire log is Log A? 

            This is a problem? 

            The requirement: "Present events in chronological order (based on a chosen primary timestamp)" -> the primary timestamp is Log A? So unmatched Log B events do not have a Log A timestamp? so we cannot order them with Log A? 

            How to handle? 

            We note: the problem says "if an event appears only in one log and has no suitable match in the other, include it as-is". So we include it? but how to order? 

            We can use the Log B timestamp? and then note that it is unmatched? 

            But then the chronological order might be:

                - First, matched events (with Log A timestamp)
                - Then, unmatched events from Log A (with Log A timestamp)
                - Then, unmatched events from Log B? but we don't know where they fall in the Log A timeline? 

            We are not given any other information? 

            We must assign a timestamp for ordering? We can use the Log B timestamp? and then sort by that? but that might not be the actual time? 

            Alternatively, we can leave the unmatched Log B events at the end? but we don't know the time? 

            The problem doesn't specify? 

            We decide: 

                We will assign a dummy timestamp for unmatched Log B events? For example, 0000-00-00T00:00:00Z? but that is not real? 

            But note: the problem says to include as-is? but then we have to present in chronological order? 

            How about we don't order the unmatched Log B events? and put them all at the end? but we don't know the time? 

            Alternatively, we can use the Log B timestamp for ordering? and then note that they are unmatched? 

            We decide: 

                For unmatched events:

                    If it's from Log A: we use the Log A timestamp for ordering? and we include it in the main timeline? 

                    If it's from Log B: we use the Log B timestamp for ordering? and we put them after all the matched and unmatched Log A events? but we don't know the relative time? 

            However, note: the problem says "chronological order (based on a chosen primary timestamp)"? The primary timestamp is Log A? So unmatched Log B events do not have a Log A timestamp? so they are not in the primary timeline? 

            We are stuck? 

            Let me re-read: "Present events in chronological order (based on a chosen primary timestamp)". The primary timestamp is the Log A timestamp? So unmatched Log B events do not have a Log A timestamp? so they are not included in the chronological order? 

            But the problem says to include them? 

            How about we do not include them in the main timeline? but at the end? and we use the Log B timestamp for their time? 

            But then the order of unmatched Log B events might be by the Log B timestamp? 

            We decide: 

                We will create a list for the merged events:

                    matched_events: each event has a timestamp (the Log A timestamp) and origin? 
                    unmatched_A: events from Log A with no match? we use the Log A timestamp? 
                    unmatched_B: events from Log B with no match? we use the Log B timestamp? 

                Then we sort the entire list by the timestamp? but note: the unmatched_B events have a timestamp that is in Log B? which might be different from the Log A timeline? 

            We are forced to use the timestamp from the original log? for unmatched events? 

            So:

                For unmatched events from Log A: we use the Log A timestamp? 
                For unmatched events from Log B: we use the Log B timestamp? 

            Then we sort all events by timestamp? but the timestamps are in different systems? and we don't know the offset? 

            The problem says: Log B timestamps may be slightly offset by a few seconds or milliseconds? 

            We don't have any conversion? 

            So we cannot convert between Zulu time and system time? 

            Therefore, we must treat the two timestamps as independent? 

            But the requirement says: "chronological order (based on a chosen primary timestamp)"? and the primary timestamp is Log A? 

            So we cannot mix? 

            We decide: 

                We will output:

                    First, all events from Log A (matched and unmatched) in the order of the Log A timestamp? 
                    Then, all events from Log B that are unmatched? and we order them by the Log B timestamp? 

            But note: an event from Log B might have a Log B timestamp that is earlier than some Log A event? but we are putting it at the end? 

            This is not chronological by the real world time? 

            The problem doesn't specify the time zone? but both are in Zulu time? so the same time zone? 

            But the offsets? we don't know? 

            We are not converting? 

            So we cannot compare Log A and Log B timestamps? 

            Therefore, we must output:

                Part 1: the matched events (with Log A timestamp) and unmatched events from Log A (with Log A timestamp) -> sorted by Log A timestamp? 
                Part 2: the unmatched events from Log B (with Log B timestamp) -> sorted by Log B timestamp? 

            But then the entire log is not in real chronological order? 

            The problem says: "Present events in chronological order (based on a chosen primary timestamp)"? and the primary timestamp is Log A? 

            So we do:

                Step 1: collect all events (matched and unmatched from Log A) and sort by Log A timestamp? 
                Step 2: then, we also have unmatched events from Log B? we cannot sort them by Log A timestamp? so we leave them at the end? and we sort them by their Log B timestamp? 

            But note: the problem doesn't say that the primary timestamp is the only one we use? 

            We decide to do:

                We'll create a list for the entire merged log:

                    events = []

                    For each order, we have:
                        - matched events: we create a merged event with Log A timestamp and Log B timestamp? and we put it in the main timeline? 
                        - unmatched Log A events: we add (timestamp: Log A, order_id, event_type, origin='LogA')
                        - unmatched Log B events: we add (timestamp: Log B, order_id, event_name? and other attributes? and origin='LogB')? 

                Then we sort the entire list by the timestamp? but note: the unmatched Log B events have a timestamp that is in Log B? which might be different from the Log A timestamp? 

            But we don't know the offset? so we cannot convert? 

            Therefore, we cannot mix? 

            We must output the main timeline first (all events with Log A timestamp) and then the unmatched Log B events? and we don't know where they fit? 

            The problem says: "if an event appears only in one log and has no suitable match in the other, include it as-is". So we include it? but we cannot order it with Log A? 

            We decide to output:

                - All events that are matched and unmatched Log A events are sorted by Log A timestamp? 
                - Then, we output unmatched Log B events? sorted by Log B timestamp? 

            And we note that the unmatched Log B events are not part of the primary timeline? 

            This is a compromise? 

        Step 5: Output format? We'll output a CSV-like? 

            We'll have columns: 
                timestamp (from the primary system? so for Log A events and matched events? we use Log A? for unmatched Log B? we use Log B? but then we are not using Log A as primary for unmatched Log B? 
                event_type (from Log A for all events? but unmatched Log B events don't have an event_type from Log A? so we leave it blank? or we use a special value? 
                order_id
                event_name (from Log B for matched events? for unmatched Log A events? we leave blank? for unmatched Log B events? we use the event_name from Log B? 
                user_id (from Log B for matched and unmatched Log B? for unmatched Log A? leave blank? 
                resource_id (from Log B for matched and unmatched Log B? for unmatched Log A? leave blank? 
                notes (from Log B for matched and unmatched Log B? for unmatched Log A? leave blank? 
                event_timestamp (from Log B for matched events? for unmatched Log B events? we put the Log B timestamp? for unmatched Log A? leave blank? 
                origin: to indicate if the event is from Log A, Log B, or matched (which could be from both? then origin='LogA' and 'LogB'? we can do origin='Merged'? 

            But note: the problem says to include all attributes? 

            Alternatively, we can have:

                For matched events: 
                    timestamp (Log A), event_type (Log A), order_id, event_name (Log B), user_id (Log B), resource_id (Log B), notes (Log B), event_timestamp (Log B), origin: 'Merged'

                For unmatched Log A events:
                    timestamp (Log A), event_type (Log A), order_id, and then the rest blank? and origin: 'LogA'

                For unmatched Log B events:
                    timestamp (Log B), event_type: blank? or we don't have? but we have event_name? we can put the event_name in event_type? or leave event_type blank? and then event_name? 
                    But the problem says: Log B has event_name? so we can have:
                        timestamp: Log B, event_type: (we leave blank? because Log B doesn't have event_type? but we have event_name? so we can put event_name in event_type? 
                    Alternatively, we can have:
                        event_type: from Log B? and then the rest? 
                    But note: the matched events have event_type from Log A? so we cannot mix? 

            We decide:

                We'll have the following columns for every event:

                    timestamp: from the primary system for the main timeline? but for unmatched Log B events, we use Log B? 
                    event_type: 
                         for matched and unmatched Log A: from Log A
                         for un
</think>
