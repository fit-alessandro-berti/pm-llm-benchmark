What a fascinating dataset!

After analyzing the data, I'll provide my interpretation of the process underlying it.

**Overview**

The data appears to represent a workflow or business process involving employee declarations, approvals, rejections, and payments. The process involves multiple stages, actors (employees, supervisors, administrators, budget owners), and outcomes (approvals, rejections, savings).

**Flow Diagram**

Here's my attempt to visualize the process:

```
                                      +----------------+
                                      |  Employee     |
                                      |  submits      |
                                      |  declaration  |
                                      +----------------+
                                             |
                                             | Declare SUBMITTED
                                             v
                                      +----------------+
                                      |  Administration |
                                      |  reviews and    |
                                      |  approves/    |
                                      |  rejects        |
                                      +----------------+
                                             |
                                             | Declare APPROVED (by Admin)
                                             | Declare REJECTED (by Admin)
                                             v

                                      |  reviews and  |
                                      |  approves/re-|

                                             | Declare REJECTED (by Supervisor)
                                             v
                                      +----------------+
                                      |  Payment Hand- |
                                      |  ledger entry  |
                                      +----------------+

                                      (Parallel flow)

                                      +----------------+

                                             |
                                             | Declare APPROVED (by Budget Owner)
                                             | Declare REJECTED (by Budget Owner)
                                             v
                                      +----------------+
                                      |  Pre-Approver  |
                                      |  reviews and  |
                                      |  approves/re-|

                                      +----------------+

                                      (Parallel flow)

                                      +----------------+
                                      |  Employee     |
                                      |  resubmits    |
                                      |  declaration  |
                                      +----------------+
                                             |
                                             | Repeat cycle
                                             v
```

**Key Steps**

1. An employee submits a declaration.
2. The administration reviews and either approves or rejects the declaration.
3. If rejected, the employee can resubmit the declaration (repeat cycle).
4. If approved, the declaration is sent to the supervisor for review.
5. The supervisor reviews and either approves or rejects the declaration.
6. If approved, the declaration becomes FINAL_APPROVED and is sent to Payment Handled.
7. There are two parallel paths:
	* Budget Owner reviews and approves/rejects the declaration.
	* Pre-Approver reviews and approves/rejects the declaration.
8. The employee can receive feedback (approval or rejection) from each of these actors.

**Frequencies and Performances**

The frequencies represent the number of times each transition occurs, while performances are likely related to processing times, costs, or other metrics associated with each step.

Please note that my interpretation is based on a visual analysis of the data; I might have missed some subtleties or nuances in the process. If you'd like me to refine my understanding or provide further insights, feel free to ask!
