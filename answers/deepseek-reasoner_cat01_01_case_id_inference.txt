Based on the analysis of patient attributes (age, gender), department, and the logical sequence of activities, the events can be grouped into **3 distinct cases** as follows:

---

### **Case 1 (45-year-old male in ER):**
- **Patient:** 45M, ER department, private insurance.
- **Events:** 1  4  7  12  15  
- **Journey:**  
  Registration  Initial triage (triage code 3)  X-ray (left leg)  Doctor consultation (diagnosis: hairline fracture)  Discharge (follow-up: outpatient clinic).

---

### **Case 2 (62-year-old female in ER):**
- **Patient:** 62F, ER department, public insurance.
- **Events:** 2  5  8  10  11  14  17  
- **Journey:**  
  Registration  Initial triage (triage code 2)  Lab test request (blood panel)  Lab test results (normal)  Doctor consultation (diagnosis: minor infection)  Prescription (antibiotics)  Discharge (follow-up: pharmacy pickup).

---

### **Case 3 (28-year-old male in Surgery):**
- **Patient:** 28M, Surgery department, private insurance.
- **Events:** 3  6  9  13  16  18  
- **Journey:**  
  Registration (Surgery)  Doctor consultation (scheduled knee surgery)  Surgery preparation (general anesthesia)  Surgery performed (arthroscopy)  Recovery room (stable)  Discharge (follow-up: physiotherapy sessions).

---

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Patient Attributes:**  
   - Age and gender are consistent within each case.  
   - No overlap in departments (ER vs. Surgery), except for Radiology/Lab, which serve multiple departments.  
2. **Logical Flow:**  
   - **Case 1/2 (ER):** Both follow the ER workflow (registration  triage  diagnostics/treatment  discharge).  
   - **Case 3 (Surgery):** Follows a surgical workflow (registration  pre-op  surgery  recovery  discharge).  
3. **Timestamps:**  
   - Events are interleaved but follow a plausible timeline for concurrent cases (e.g., 45M and 62F treated in parallel in ER).  
4. **Resources:**  
   - Dr. Lee (Surgery) handles the surgical case, while Dr. Smith (ER) manages the 62F’s infection.  

This grouping aligns with the expected hospital processes and patient-specific attributes.
