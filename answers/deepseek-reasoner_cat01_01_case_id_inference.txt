The events can be grouped into **three distinct cases** based on the `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, and logical activity sequences. Here's the inferred grouping:

---

### **Case 1 (45-year-old male in ER):**  
- **Events:** 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
- **Journey Summary:**  
  1. Registered in ER (private insurance).  
  4. Initial triage (triage code 3).  
  7. X-ray imaging (left leg).  
  12. Diagnosed with a hairline fracture by Dr. Lee.  
  15. Discharged with followup at outpatient clinic.

### **Case 2 (62-year-old female in ER):**  
- **Events:** 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  
- **Journey Summary:**  
  2. Registered in ER (public insurance).  
  5. Initial triage (triage code 2).  
  8. Lab test requested (blood panel).  
  10. Lab test completed (normal levels).  
  11. Diagnosed with minor infection by Dr. Smith.  
  14. Prescribed antibiotics.  
  17. Discharged with pharmacy pickup followup.

### **Case 3 (28-year-old male in Surgery):**  
- **Events:** 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18  
- **Journey Summary:**  
  3. Registered in Surgery (private insurance).  
  6. Doctor consultation for scheduled knee surgery.  
  9. Surgery preparation (general anesthesia).  
  13. Arthroscopy performed by Dr. Lee.  
  16. Recovery room (stable condition).  
  18. Discharged with physiotherapy followup.  

---

### **Key Grouping Logic:**  
1. **Patient Demographics:** Unique `patient_age` and `patient_gender` combinations define separate cases.  
2. **Department Consistency:**  
   - Case 1 and 2 involve ER workflows (triage, lab, discharge).  
   - Case 3 follows a Surgery-specific path (pre-op consultation, surgery, recovery).  
3. **Temporal and Logical Flow:**  
   - Events for each case follow a plausible medical workflow (e.g., registration  triage  tests  treatment  discharge).  
   - Timestamps are interleaved but logically ordered within each case.  
4. **Resource/Department Alignment:**  
   - Dr. Lee (Surgery) handles Case 3, while Dr. Smith (ER) handles Case 2.  
   - Radiology (X-ray) aligns with Case 1’s fracture diagnosis.  

This grouping ensures each case represents a coherent patient journey.
