Based on the provided event log and the observed behavior, the process tree can be structured to capture the main flow, the optional repeating loop for requesting missing information and re-validation, and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival. Here's the final structure of the process tree:

```plaintext
+ ( 'Receive Application (RA)', 
   -> ( 'Validate Form (VF)', 
       -> ( 'Assess Eligibility (AE)', 
           * ( 
             -> ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 
                 'Validate Form (VF)' 
               ), 
             tau 
           ), 
           -> ( 'Approval Decision (AD)', 
               -> ( 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 
                   'Archive Case (AC)' 
                 ) 
             ) 
         ) 
     ) 
   ) 
```

### Explanation:
- **Parallel:** The process starts with 'Receive Application (RA)' and then proceeds to the sequence of activities.
- **Sequence:** Activities 'Validate Form (VF)', 'Assess Eligibility (AE)', and the looping structure are sequentially executed.
- **Loop:** The loop captures the optional process of requesting missing information and re-validation, which can repeat multiple times until the loop is exited implicitly.
- **Sequence after loop:** Once the loop is exited, the process continues with 'Approval Decision (AD)', followed by 'Send Confirmation (SC)', and finally 'Archive Case (AC)'.

This process tree captures the essential behavior observed in the event log, balancing fitness, precision, and simplicity.
