### Assumptions:
1. For "Items Picked" events, the assumption is that each item's picking represents a distinct event if the timestamps are meaningfully different.
2. The "Other Attributes" column includes additional information relevant to the context, such as order priority, carrier notes, payment methods, etc., to enrich the event log with useful data.
3. In cases where multiple activities occur at the same timestamp (e.g., picking of multiple items at the same time), they are listed as separate events to maintain detail and clarity.
4. The actors/resources are identified using their IDs from the respective tables, assuming the person or entity responsible for the event matches the ones performing the action in the mentioned tables.
