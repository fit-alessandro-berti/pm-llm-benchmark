**Performance Analysis of Insurance Claims Processing Event Log**

---

### **1. Identify Cases with Performance Issues**

To determine which cases are taking significantly longer, we calculate the **total case duration** (time from “Submit Claim” to “Close Claim”) for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time           | End Time             | Duration       |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 2001   | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30     | **1.5 hours**  |
| 2002   | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00     | **~26 hours**  |
| 2003   | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30     | **~48.3 hours**|
| 2004   | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45     | **1.4 hours**  |
| 2005   | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30     | **~77 hours**  |

**Conclusion:**  
- **Cases 2002, 2003, and especially 2005** exhibit **significantly longer durations** compared to the baseline (Cases 2001 and 2004, which complete in <2 hours).
- **Case 2005** is the **worst performer**, taking over **3 days** to complete.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis Using Attributes**

We now examine how **Resource**, **Region**, and **Complexity** correlate with these long durations.

#### **A. Complexity Level**

- **Low Complexity (Cases 2001, 2004):**  
  - Completed in ~1.5 hours.  
  - **No “Request Additional Documents”** activity.  
  - Straightforward path: Submit  Evaluate  Approve  Pay  Close.

- **Medium Complexity (Case 2002):**  
  - One “Request Additional Documents” on Day 1.  
  - Approval delayed until next day (~5-hour gap between request and approval).  
  - Total duration: ~26 hours.

- **High Complexity (Cases 2003, 2005):**  
  - **Multiple “Request Additional Documents”** events:
    - Case 2003: 2 requests (11:00 and 17:00 on Day 1), approval next day.
    - Case 2005: **3 requests** over **3 days** (Apr 1, 2, 3), approval only on Apr 4.
  - **Long idle periods** between document requests and final approval.
  - Total durations: 48+ and 77+ hours.

 **Observation:**  
> **High complexity strongly correlates with repeated document requests and extended case duration.**  
> The need for multiple rounds of documentation significantly delays approval.

#### **B. Resource Performance**

- **Adjusters (key decision-makers for document requests):**
  - **Adjuster_Mike (Region A):** Handles Cases 2001 (Low) and 2003 (High).  
    - For high-complexity Case 2003, issues 2 requests on same day  relatively efficient.
  - **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B):** Handles Cases 2002 (Medium), 2004 (Low), and 2005 (High).  
    - For **Case 2005**, issues **3 separate requests over 3 days**, suggesting:
      - Incomplete initial request,
      - Poor coordination with claimant,
      - Or reactive (rather than proactive) documentation gathering.

 **Observation:**  
> **Adjuster_Lisa’s handling of high-complexity claims (especially Case 2005) appears inefficient**, leading to **prolonged cycles** of document requests.  
> In contrast, Adjuster_Mike consolidates requests more effectively.

#### **C. Region Analysis**

- **Region A:** Cases 2001 (Low) and 2003 (High)  
  - Even high-complexity Case 2003 resolved in **2 days**.
- **Region B:** Cases 2002 (Medium), 2004 (Low), 2005 (High)  
  - Low-complexity Case 2004 is fast (~1.4 hrs), but **high-complexity Case 2005 takes 3+ days**.
  - Medium Case 2002 also slower than comparable low cases.

 **Observation:**  
> **Region B shows systemic delays in handling complex claims**, likely due to **resource behavior (Adjuster_Lisa)** or **regional process inefficiencies** (e.g., slower internal coordination, less access to claimant data).

---

### **3. Root Causes & Mitigation Recommendations**

#### **Primary Root Causes:**

1. **High Complexity  Fragmented Documentation Requests**  
   - Adjusters are not collecting all required documents in the first request, leading to **multiple back-and-forth cycles**.
   - This is especially severe in **Case 2005**, where 3 separate requests span 3 days.

2. **Resource-Specific Inefficiency (Adjuster_Lisa)**  
   - Same adjuster handles both fast (Case 2004) and extremely slow (Case 2005) cases — difference is **complexity**, but her approach to complex cases is suboptimal.
   - Suggests **lack of training or checklist usage** for complex claims.

3. **Regional Disparity (Region B)**  
   - While low-complexity claims are handled well, **Region B struggles disproportionately with complex cases**, possibly due to:
     - Less experienced staff,
     - Poor integration with document management systems,
     - Higher claimant response times (though not visible in log).

### **Recommendations to Mitigate Performance Issues**

1. **Implement Standardized Documentation Checklists by Complexity Tier**  
   - For **High-complexity claims**, enforce a **comprehensive initial document request** based on claim type (e.g., auto accident vs. property damage).
   - Reduces need for follow-up requests.

2. **Adjuster Training & Performance Coaching**  
   - Provide **targeted coaching to Adjuster_Lisa** on handling complex claims.
   - Use **Case 2003 (Adjuster_Mike)** as a benchmark for efficient high-complexity processing.

3. **Introduce SLAs for Document Request Cycles**  
   - Limit to **one initial request**; if more info is needed, require supervisor approval.
   - Set **maximum 24-hour window** for claimant response before escalation.

4. **Region-Level Process Review for Region B**  
   - Investigate whether Region B lacks tools or support for complex claims.
   - Consider **cross-regional knowledge sharing** (e.g., shadowing Adjuster_Mike).

5. **Monitor “Request Additional Documents” Frequency as KPI**  
   - Flag cases with **>1 document request** for quality review.
   - Track **time between requests** to identify bottlenecks.

---

### **Summary**

- **Problem Cases:** 2002, 2003, and especially **2005**.
- **Key Driver:** **High complexity** combined with **inefficient document collection**.
- **Amplifying Factor:** **Adjuster_Lisa’s approach** in **Region B** exacerbates delays.
- **Solution Focus:** Standardize complex-claim intake, train adjusters, and monitor request cycles.

By addressing these root causes, the organization can significantly reduce case duration—particularly for high-complexity claims—without compromising validation quality.
