The image consists of three parts labeled (a), (b), and (c). 

- **Part (a)**: This section shows two process classes connected through two channels, illustrating how these processes interact with each other in a flowchart format.

- **Part (b)**: This part presents a class diagram that includes two process classes. It visually represents relationships between different elements such as "Lab visit," "Order system," "Perform test," "Make report," and others, indicating dependencies or interactions among them.

- **Part (c)**: This is an example of a performative, which appears to be a table or matrix detailing specific attributes like time, channel, sender, receiver, action, content, scope, and direction. The example given involves sending a report at 11:00 via an order system from a lab visit to John regarding a HGB test result.

Each part serves to illustrate different aspects of process management and interaction within a system, likely related to laboratory procedures and data handling.
