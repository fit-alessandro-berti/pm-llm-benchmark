### **Process Flow Description**

#### **Start Event:**
- **Invoice Received**  
  Triggered when an invoice arrives via email.

---

#### **Main Sequence Flow:**

1. **Activity: Validate Purchase Order (PO) Number**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Description:** Check if the invoice contains a valid PO number.  
   - **Gateway/Decision Point:**  
     - If no PO number exists → **Send Back to Supplier** requesting additional details or escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
     - If a PO number exists → Proceed to next step.  

2. **Activity: Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Artifact Created:** Logged Invoice Record in the system.  

3. **Activity: Forward to Purchasing Department for Confirmation**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Recipient Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   - **Description:** Request confirmation that goods/services were received as per the PO.  

4. **Activity: Verify Invoice Details Against PO**  
   - **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   - **Description:** Compare quantities, prices, and delivery charges on the invoice with the PO.  
   - **Gateway/Decision Point:**  
     - If discrepancies exist → Contact Supplier or escalate to Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)/Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
     - If everything matches → Send confirmation back to Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).  

5. **Activity: Match Invoice Line Items with PO**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Description:** Ensure all line items match the PO.  
   - **Gateway/Decision Point:**  
     - If discrepancies remain unresolved → Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
     - If resolved → Proceed to next step.  

6. **Activity: Request Manager’s Approval**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Recipient Role:** Department Manager (Carlos)  
   - **Trigger:** Automatic email notification sent by the system after matching is complete.  
   - **Description:** Manager reviews the invoice, PO, and confirmation.  
   - **Gateway/Decision Point:**  
     - If approved → Proceed to scheduling payment.  
     - If rejected → Return to Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) for further investigation.  

7. **Activity: Schedule Payment**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Artifact Updated:** Payment scheduled in the accounting system.  

8. **End Event: Payment Scheduled**  
   - Triggered when the invoice is successfully added to the payment queue.

#### **Exception Handling and Alternate Paths:**

1. **Missing PO Number Exception**  
   - **Path:**  
     - Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) escalates to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
     - Rita works with department heads to create a retrospective PO or reject the invoice.  
   - **Outcome:** Once resolved, return to main flow starting at "Log Invoice into Accounting System."

2. **Discrepancy Resolution Loop**  
   - **Path:**  
     - Discrepancies detected during verification (by Dan or Mary) trigger escalation to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
     - Rita coordinates with Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) to resolve issues with the supplier.  
     - Karen contacts suppliers to obtain corrected invoices or clarify terms.  
   - **Outcome:** Once resolved, return to main flow starting at "Verify Invoice Details Against PO."

3. **Manager Rejection Path**  
   - **Path:**  
     - If Department Manager (Carlos) rejects the invoice, it returns to Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).  
     - Mary investigates further and may involve Purchasing Officer (Dan), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), or Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) depending on the issue.  
   - **Outcome:** Once resolved, return to main flow starting at "Request Manager’s Approval."

---

#### **Uncertainties Noted:**
1. The exact mechanism for resolving informal contracts without POs is unclear; this requires coordination between Rita and department heads but lacks detailed steps.
2. The frequency of certain exceptions (e.g., missing POs, pricing discrepancies) was not quantified, making it challenging to prioritize exception-handling paths.

### **Summary of Key Artifacts/Data Objects:**
1. **Invoice Document**  
   - Moves through validation, logging, verification, matching, approval, and scheduling stages.  
2. **Purchase Order (PO)**  
   - Used as a reference throughout the process.  
3. **Accounting System Records**  
   - Updated at various points (logging, scheduling payments).  
4. **Email Notifications**  
   - Sent automatically for manager approvals and manually for escalations.  

This textual representation captures the core workflow while highlighting ambiguities and exceptions, providing a clear foundation for creating a visual BPMN diagram.
