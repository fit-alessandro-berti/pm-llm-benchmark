This image shows a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram depicting an order-to-production workflow across four different departments or "swim lanes":

1. **Sales** (top lane):
   - The process begins on Monday morning
   - First, orders are checked for completeness
   - Then the system checks if the customer is already in the database
   - If not, the customer is added to the database
   - Once the customer is in the database, order details are sent
   - After product is sent (from Warehouse), an invoice is drafted

2. **Production** (second lane):
   - Receives order details from Sales
   - Plans production
   - Manufactures the product
   - Has a decision point for material quality (faulty vs. not faulty)
   - Sends "product complete" message to Warehouse

3. **Procurement** (third lane):
   - Contains a "Material Compensation Subprocess"
   - Receives order details
   - Orders materials
   - Checks materials
   - Has a path to return materials if needed
   - Completes order cancellation under certain conditions

4. **Warehouse** (bottom lane):
   - Receives "product complete" notification from Production
   - Sends the product
   - Notifies Sales that the product has been sent

The diagram uses standard BPMN elements including:
- Start and end events (circles)
- Tasks (rounded rectangles)
- Gateways (diamonds) for decision points
- Message events (envelopes)
- Timer events (clock symbols)
- Flow connections (solid and dashed lines)

This visualization effectively shows how the order processing flows across different departments, from initial order receipt through production, procurement, and finally shipping, with the appropriate handoffs and dependencies between departments.
