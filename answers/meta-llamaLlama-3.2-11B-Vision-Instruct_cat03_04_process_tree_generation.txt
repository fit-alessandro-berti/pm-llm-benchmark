Here is an example of how you can create a process tree for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process in pm4py:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

def create_purchase_to_pay_process_tree():
    root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP)
    
    # Receive Purchase Request
    receive_request = ProcessTree(label='Receive Purchase Request', parent=root)
    root.children.append(receive_request)

    # Approve Purchase Request
    approve_request = ProcessTree(label='Approve Purchase Request', parent=root)
    root.children.append(approve_request)

    # Get Supplier Quotes
    get_quotes = ProcessTree(label='Get Supplier Quotes', parent=root)
    root.children.append(get_quotes)

    # Select Supplier
    select_supplier = ProcessTree(label='Select Supplier', parent=root)
    root.children.append(select_supplier)

    # Place Order
    place_order = ProcessTree(label='Place Order', parent=root)
    root.children.append(place_order)

    # Receive Goods
    receive_goods = ProcessTree(label='Receive Goods', parent=root)
    root.children.append(receive_goods)

    # Settle Invoice
    settle_invoice = ProcessTree(label='Settle Invoice', parent=root)
    root.children.append(settle_invoice)

    # Exclusive choice for receiving goods or settling invoice
    goods_or_invoice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
    root.children.append(goods_or_invoice)

    # Receive Goods Path
    receive_goods_path = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=goods_or_invoice)
    goods_path_child1 = ProcessTree(label='Receive Goods', parent=receive_goods_path)
    goods_path_child2 = ProcessTree(label='Inspect Goods', parent=receive_goods_path)
    goods_path_child3 = ProcessTree(label='Accept Goods', parent=receive_goods_path)
    receive_goods_path.children.append(goods_path_child1)
    receive_goods_path.children.append(goods_path_child2)
    receive_goods_path.children.append(goods_path_child3)
    goods_or_invoice.children.append(receive_goods_path)

    # Settle Invoice Path
    settle_invoice_path = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=goods_or_invoice)
    invoice_path_child1 = ProcessTree(label='Receive Invoice', parent=settle_invoice_path)
    invoice_path_child2 = ProcessTree(label='Verify Invoice', parent=settle_invoice_path)
    invoice_path_child3 = ProcessTree(label='Settle Invoice', parent=settle_invoice_path)
    settle_invoice_path
