### Issues with the Current Model

The current process tree model allows for unwanted behavior due to the use of a parallel block (AND) for activities that should occur in a strict sequence. Specifically, the parallel block allows activities like "Receive Goods," "Receive Invoice," "Match Invoice to PO," and "Pay Invoice" to occur in any order, which is not appropriate for the "Procure-to-Pay" process.

### Corrected Process Tree Model

To ensure the correct sequence and prevent unwanted behavior, we need to enforce the following order:
1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Create Purchase Order**
4. **Receive Goods**
5. **Receive Invoice**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**
7. **Pay Invoice**
8. **Close Case**

Here is the corrected process tree model:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Define activities
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Corrected structure:
# A sequence that starts with creating and approving the requisition,
# followed by a sequence for creating the purchase order and receiving goods,
# followed by a sequence for receiving the invoice, matching it to the PO, and paying the invoice,
# followed by closing the case.
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,
    approve_req,
    create_po,
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice,
    close_case
])
```

### Explanation

1. **Create Purchase Requisition** and **Approve Purchase Requisition** are strictly sequential and must occur in that order.
2. **Create Purchase Order** and **Receive Goods** are sequential and must occur in that order.
3. **Receive Invoice**, **Match Invoice to PO**, and **Pay Invoice** are sequential and must occur in that order.
4. **Close Case** is the final step and must occur after all the above steps.

By using a sequence operator (SEQUENCE) for each set of activities that must occur in a specific order, we ensure that the process tree enforces the correct sequence and prevents unwanted behavior. This corrected model ensures that the "Procure-to-Pay" process follows the intended logic and prevents any out-of-order activities.
