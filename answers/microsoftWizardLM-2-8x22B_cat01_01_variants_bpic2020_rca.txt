 To identify the root causes for the performance issues in the process, we need to analyze the provided data specific to each process variant. Here are some observations based on the frequency and performance data:

1. **High Rejection Rates**: The process has multiple instances where declarations are rejected by various roles (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER). Rejections lead to rework, which increases the time and cost associated with the process. For example:
   - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION has a high performance cost (13805869.200) with a relatively low frequency (5), indicating a significant delay or cost when rejections occur at this stage.
   - There are several instances where declarations are rejected multiple times before being approved, which suggests that the rejection handling process is inefficient and could be a major bottleneck.

2. **Inefficient Approval Routes**: Some process variants include additional approval steps (e.g., by BUDGET OWNER or PRE_APPROVER) that may not be necessary for all declarations. This can lead to unnecessary delays and increased costs. For example:
   - The variant with BUDGET OWNER approval has a high performance value (1084338.407) but a lower frequency (2473) compared to the variant without BUDGET OWNER approval (854633.975 with a frequency of 1392), suggesting that the additional step adds complexity and time to the process.

3. **Missing Roles**: There is an instance of a declaration being rejected by a "MISSING" role, which is likely a process error. This could indicate a lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities, leading to confusion and delays. For example:
   - Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING (frequency = 21, performance = 872310.667) indicates a process breakdown.

4. **High Variability in Performance**: There is significant variability in the performance values across different process variants, which suggests inconsistency
