Looking at the normative process description, I can identify the following key rules and expected flows:

## Expected Process Flows:

**Sufficient Inventory Path:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

**Insufficient Inventory Path:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

## Key Constraints:
1. "Check inventory" must precede payment authorization decisions
2. "Authorize payment" must occur after inventory check and before packaging
3. "Package items" must occur after payment authorization and before shipping
4. "Ship order" must occur after packaging and never after cancellation
5. "Close order" should be the final activity
6. After cancellation, no fulfillment activities should occur

## Analysis of Cases:

### **Case 1: COMPLIANT**
Follows the correct sufficient inventory sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close

### **Case 2: VIOLATION**
**Violation:** Activities occur in wrong order
- "Package items" (10:00) happens before "Authorize payment" (10:30)
- This violates the rule that packaging should only occur after authorization
- The sequence should be: Check  Authorize  Package  Ship, not Check  Package  Authorize  Ship

### **Case 3: MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS**
**Violation 1:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"
- This directly violates the rule that shipping should "never occur after a cancellation"
- Once an order is canceled, fulfillment activities should not continue

**Violation 2:** Missing "Package items" step
- The process ships without packaging, violating the requirement that shipping should only occur after packaging

**Violation 3:** Inconsistent logic
- Payment is authorized but then the order is canceled, suggesting process inconsistency

### **Case 4: COMPLIANT**
Follows the correct insufficient inventory sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close

### **Case 5: VIOLATION**
**Violation:** "Ship order" occurs without "Package items"
- The process skips the required packaging step
- This violates the rule that "Ship order should only occur after packaging"
- The sequence jumps from Authorize payment directly to Ship order

## Summary:
- **Compliant cases:** 1, 4
- **Non-compliant cases:** 2, 3, 5
- **Most common violation:** Incorrect sequencing of packaging and shipping activities
- **Most severe violation:** Case 3's shipping after cancellation
