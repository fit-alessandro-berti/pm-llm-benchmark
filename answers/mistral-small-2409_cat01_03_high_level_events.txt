### High-Level Activities and Their Justifications

**1. Material Preparation**

**Grouped Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Justification:**
These events are all part of the initial preparation phase of the manufacturing process. They involve getting the raw material ready for the next step in the assembly. All these actions are performed in sequence and are necessary to prepare the material for welding.

**Name:** Material Preparation

**2. Assembly**

**Grouped Events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Justification:**
These events represent the assembly phase where the material is being shaped and joined together. The actions are specific to the assembly process and are logically grouped together as they involve the same resource (Operator B) and are temporally close, indicating a coherent step in the process.

**Name:** Assembly

**3. Quality Inspection**

**Grouped Events:**
- Measure weld integrity
- Visual check

**Justification:**
These events are focused on ensuring the quality of the assembly work. The measurement of weld integrity and the visual check are both quality control steps that follow the assembly to verify the product meets the required standards.

**Name:** Quality Inspection

**4. Coating and Drying**

**Grouped Events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Justification:**
These events are part of the final treatment of the product to protect it. The coating application and drying are distinct steps that occur after the quality inspection and are essential to prepare the final product for delivery.

**Name:** Coating and Drying
