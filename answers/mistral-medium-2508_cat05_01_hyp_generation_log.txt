# Analysis of Order Process Anomalies

Based on the provided event logs and process flow, I've identified several anomalies and undesirable behaviors that warrant investigation.

## Major Anomalies Identified

### 1. Process Sequence Violations

**Case 1002 (Priority Order):**
- The normal flow is violated with "Confirm Shipment" occurring before "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock"
- This suggests a "ship first, check later" approach which is risky for credit and inventory management
- The "attempted_early=Y" flag in the Confirm Shipment event suggests this was intentional

**Case 1003:**
- "Ship Goods" occurs before "Confirm Shipment" (with a "late_confirmation=Y" flag)
- This is the opposite violation - shipping without proper confirmation

**Case 1004:**
- "Receive Payment" occurs before "Issue Invoice" which is completely backwards from normal accounting practices
- The shipment was initially marked as "not scheduled" but then goods were shipped anyway

### 2. Missing Process Steps

**Case 1003:**
- Missing "Validate Stock" activity entirely
- This could lead to shipping items that aren't actually in stock

**Case 1004:**
- Missing "Perform Credit Check" activity
- This is particularly concerning as it means orders are being processed without credit verification

### 3. Timing Anomalies

**Case 1002:**
- Extremely fast processing (from order to shipment in 20 minutes)
- While this is a "priority" order, the speed suggests possible bypassing of normal controls

**Case 1004:**
- Payment received just 5 minutes after order registration
- This is highly unusual and suggests either pre-payment or some other irregular process

## Hypothesized Causes

1. **System Workarounds:**
   - Employees may be using system backdoors or manual overrides to bypass normal workflows
   - The system may have insufficient validation to prevent out-of-sequence operations

2. **Role-Based Access Issues:**
   - Some roles may have excessive permissions allowing them to perform activities outside their normal scope
   - The "attempted_early" and "late_confirmation" flags suggest manual interventions

3. **Priority Order Handling:**
   - The priority order (1002) shows significant process deviations, suggesting special handling that may lack proper controls
   - There may be pressure to expedite priority orders at the expense of proper procedures

4. **Training Gaps:**
   - Employees may not fully understand the proper sequence of operations
   - The missing steps suggest some employees may not know all required activities

5. **System Integration Issues:**
   - The payment before invoice in case 1004 suggests possible integration problems between financial systems
   - There may be asynchronous processing that isn't properly synchronized

6. **Fraud Potential:**
   - The unusual payment patterns in case 1004 could indicate fraudulent activity
   - The missing credit check in case 1004 is particularly concerning from a fraud prevention perspective

## Proposed SQL Investigations

### 1. Identify All Process Sequence Violations

```sql
WITH expected_sequence AS (
    SELECT
        'Register Order' AS activity,
        1 AS expected_order UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Perform Credit Check', 2 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Validate Stock', 3 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Confirm Shipment', 4 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Ship Goods', 5 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Issue Invoice', 6 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Receive Payment', 7
),
case_activities AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS actual_order
    FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT
    c.case_id,
    o.order_type,
    o.order_value,
    c.activity,
    c.actual_order,
    e.expected_order,
    c.actual_order - e.expected_order AS deviation
FROM case_activities c
JOIN expected_sequence e ON c.activity = e.activity
JOIN orders o ON c.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE c.actual_order != e.expected_order
ORDER BY ABS(c.actual_order - e.expected_order) DESC, c.case_id;
```

### 2. Find Cases with Missing Required Activities

```sql
WITH required_activities AS (
    SELECT 'Register Order' AS activity UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Perform Credit Check' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Validate Stock' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Confirm Shipment' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Ship Goods' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Issue Invoice' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Receive Payment'
),
case_activities AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id, activity
    FROM order_event_log
),
missing_activities AS (
    SELECT
        r.activity,
        c.case_id,
        o.order_type,
        o.order_value
    FROM required_activities r
    CROSS JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) c
    LEFT JOIN case_activities ca ON r.activity = ca.activity AND c.case_id = ca.case_id
    JOIN orders o ON c.case_id = o.case_id
    WHERE ca.activity IS NULL
)
SELECT * FROM missing_activities
ORDER BY case_id, activity;
```

### 3. Analyze Processing Time Anomalies

```sql
WITH order_durations AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MIN(timestamp) AS order_start,
        MAX(timestamp) AS order_end,
        MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS total_duration
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
avg_durations AS (
    SELECT
        AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM total_duration)/3600) AS avg_hours,
        STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM total_duration)/3600) AS stddev_hours
    FROM order_durations
)
SELECT
    o.case_id,
    o.order_type,
    o.order_value,
    od.total_duration,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM od.total_duration)/3600 AS duration_hours,
    ad.avg_hours,
    ad.stddev_hours,
    (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM od.total_duration)/3600 - ad.avg_hours)/NULLIF(ad.stddev_hours, 0) AS z_score
FROM order_durations od
JOIN orders o ON od.case_id = o.case_id
CROSS JOIN avg_durations ad
ORDER BY ABS(z_score) DESC;
```

### 4. Investigate Role-Based Anomalies

```sql
SELECT
    oel.case_id,
    o.order_type,
    o.order_value,
    oel.activity,
    oel.resource,
    r.role,
    r.department,
    oel.timestamp,
    LAG(oel.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY oel.case_id ORDER BY oel.timestamp) AS previous_activity,
    LEAD(oel.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY oel.case_id ORDER BY oel.timestamp) AS next_activity
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN orders o ON oel.case_id = o.case_id
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE
    -- Credit checks not performed by Finance
    (oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND r.department != 'Finance')
    OR
    -- Shipments not confirmed by Logistics
    (oel.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND r.department != 'Logistics')
    OR
    -- Invoices not issued by Finance
    (oel.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND r.department != 'Finance')
ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.timestamp;
```

### 5. Examine Payment Before Invoice Cases

```sql
WITH payment_before_invoice AS (
    SELECT
        oel1.case_id,
        oel1.timestamp AS payment_time,
        oel2.timestamp AS invoice_time,
        oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp AS is_correct_order,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (oel2.timestamp - oel1.timestamp))/60 AS minutes_between
    FROM order_event_log oel1
    JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
    WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
    AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
)
SELECT
    pbi.case_id,
    o.order_type,
    o.order_value,
    pbi.is_correct_order,
    CASE
        WHEN NOT pbi.is_correct_order THEN 'Payment before invoice'
        ELSE 'Normal sequence'
    END AS sequence_status,
    ABS(pbi.minutes_between) AS abs_minutes_between,
    oel1.additional_info AS payment_details,
    oel2.additional_info AS invoice_details
FROM payment_before_invoice pbi
JOIN orders o ON pbi.case_id = o.case_id
JOIN order_event_log oel1 ON pbi.case_id = oel1.case_id AND oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON pbi.case_id = oel2.case_id AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
ORDER BY pbi.is_correct_order, ABS(pbi.minutes_between);
```

### 6. Analyze Priority Order Handling Differences

```sql
WITH order_stats AS (
    SELECT
        o.case_id,
        o.order_type,
        o.order_value,
        MIN(oel.timestamp) AS first_activity_time,
        MAX(oel.timestamp) AS last_activity_time,
        MAX(oel.timestamp) - MIN(oel.timestamp) AS total_duration,
        COUNT(*) AS total_activities,
        BOOL_AND(oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check') AS has_credit_check,
        BOOL_AND(oel.activity = 'Validate Stock') AS has_stock_validation
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_event_log oel ON o.case_id = oel.case_id
    GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_type, o.order_value
)
SELECT
    order_type,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM total_duration)/3600) AS avg_duration_hours,
    AVG(total_activities) AS avg_activities,
    SUM(CASE WHEN NOT has_credit_check THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_credit_checks,
    SUM(CASE WHEN NOT has_stock_validation THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_stock_validations,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM order_stats
GROUP BY order_type
ORDER BY avg_duration_hours;
```

### 7. Investigate Early/Late Confirmation Flags

```sql
SELECT
    oel.case_id,
    o.order_type,
    o.order_value,
    oel.activity,
    oel.additional_info,
    oel.timestamp,
    LAG(oel.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY oel.case_id ORDER BY oel.timestamp) AS previous_activity,
    LEAD(oel.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY oel.case_id ORDER BY oel.timestamp) AS next_activity,
    r.role,
    r.department
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN orders o ON oel.case_id = o.case_id
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE oel.additional_info LIKE '%early%' OR oel.additional_info LIKE '%late%'
ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.timestamp;
```

### 8. Correlation Between Credit Scores and Process Deviations

```sql
WITH credit_scores AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        CAST(SPLIT_PART(additional_info, '=', 2) AS INTEGER) AS credit_score
    FROM order_event_log
    WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
),
process_compliance AS (
    SELECT
        oel.case_id,
        BOOL_AND(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN TRUE ELSE NULL END) AS has_credit_check,
        BOOL_AND(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN TRUE ELSE NULL END) AS has_stock_check,
        COUNT(DISTINCT oel.activity) = 7 AS complete_process
    FROM order_event_log oel
    GROUP BY oel.case_id
)
SELECT
    o.case_id,
    o.order_type,
    o.order_value,
    cs.credit_score,
    pc.has_credit_check,
    pc.has_stock_check,
    pc.complete_process,
    CASE
        WHEN cs.credit_score < 700 AND NOT pc.complete_process THEN 'High-risk incomplete process'
        WHEN cs.credit_score < 700 THEN 'High-risk but complete'
        WHEN NOT pc.complete_process THEN 'Incomplete process'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS risk_category
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN credit_scores cs ON o.case_id = cs.case_id
LEFT JOIN process_compliance pc ON o.case_id = pc.case_id
ORDER BY
    CASE
        WHEN cs.credit_score < 700 AND NOT pc.complete_process THEN 1
        WHEN cs.credit_score < 700 THEN 2
        WHEN NOT pc.complete_process THEN 3
        ELSE 4
    END,
    cs.credit_score;
```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Process Audit:**
   - Conduct a full audit of cases with sequence violations to understand the business impact
   - Review all priority orders for proper controls

2. **System Controls:**
   - Implement sequence validation in the order processing system to prevent out-of-order operations
   - Add mandatory fields/checks for all required process steps

3. **Role Review:**
   - Review role permissions to ensure employees can only perform appropriate activities
   - Implement segregation of duties for critical financial operations

4. **Training Program:**
   - Develop targeted training for employees who bypassed steps or performed out-of-sequence activities
   - Emphasize the importance of proper process flow, especially for financial controls

5. **Monitoring:**
   - Implement real-time monitoring for process deviations
   - Set up alerts for unusual patterns like payments before invoices

6. **Fraud Investigation:**
   - Closely examine case 1004 for potential fraudulent activity
   - Review all cases missing credit checks for credit risk exposure

7. **Process Redesign:**
   - Consider redesigning the priority order process to maintain proper controls while expediting
   - Evaluate if certain steps can be parallelized rather than bypassed

The SQL queries provided should help identify the scope of these issues and provide data to support corrective actions. The patterns suggest both systemic issues (process design flaws) and potential individual behaviors (workarounds or errors) that need to be addressed.
