### **BPMN-Like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**  

#### **Participants & Roles:**  
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)** – Logs invoices, matches them to POs, and forwards them for validation and approval.  
- **Purchasing Officer (Purchasing)** – Confirms receipt of goods/services and validates invoice details.  
- **Department Manager (Manager)** – Provides final approval or requests further investigation.  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (AP Supervisor)** – Handles escalations and exceptions.  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Supplier Manager)** – Coordinates with suppliers to resolve invoice discrepancies.  
- **Supplier** – Provides invoices and clarifications when requested.

### **Main Process Flow:**  
1. **Invoice Receipt** *(AP Clerk)*  
   - Invoice is received (typically via email).  
   - **Decision:** Does the invoice include a valid Purchase Order (PO) number?  
     - **Yes:** Proceed to step 2.  
     - **No:** Return the invoice to the supplier requesting the PO number → [End of Process for now].  

2. **Invoice Logging** *(AP Clerk)*  
   - The invoice is logged into the accounting system.  

3. **Invoice Validation by Purchasing** *(Purchasing)*  
   - The invoice is sent to Purchasing for validation.  
   - **Decision:** Do invoice details match the PO (quantities, prices, and other terms)?  
     - **Yes:** Confirm receipt via email to AP Clerk → Proceed to step 5.  
     - **No:** Investigate discrepancy → Go to step 4.  

4. **Invoice Discrepancy Handling** *(Purchasing, AP Clerk, Supplier Manager, Supplier)*  
   - If discrepancies exist:  
     - Purchasing may contact the supplier for clarification/correction.  
     - AP Clerk may be asked to hold the invoice.  
     - Supplier Manager may get involved to check contracts and pricing.  
   - **Decision:** Can the discrepancy be resolved?  
     - **Yes:** Purchasing confirms resolution → Return to step 3.  
     - **No:** Escalate to AP Supervisor → Go to step 4a.  

   4a. **Escalation to AP Supervisor** *(AP Supervisor)*  
   - AP Supervisor investigates and coordinates between departments or with the supplier.  
   - If an invoice lacks a PO (e.g., informal service contracts), the AP Supervisor may work with department heads to generate a retrospective PO or decide to reject the invoice.  
   - Once resolved, return to step 3.  

5. **Invoice Matching with PO** *(AP Clerk)*  
   - AP Clerk performs final system match of invoice details against the PO.  
   - **Decision:** Does the invoice match?  
     - **Yes:** Proceed to step 6.  
     - **No:** Contact Purchasing for clarification → (Loop back to step 3 or escalate to AP Supervisor at step 4a if unresolved).  

6. **Manager Approval** *(Manager)*  
   - Once the invoice is validated and matched, the system triggers an approval request for the Manager.  
   - **Decision:** Does the Manager approve the invoice?  
     - **Yes:** Proceed to step 7.  
     - **No:** The Manager requests further investigation (reverting to AP Clerk at step 5 or escalating to AP Supervisor at step 4a).  

7. **Payment Scheduling** *(AP Clerk)*  
   - Approved invoices are scheduled for payment in the next available payment run.

### **Exceptions & Variations:**  
- If an invoice is missing a PO, it is immediately returned to the supplier.  
- If an invoice contains discrepancies (wrong price, missing items, extra charges), it is held for resolution.  
- Unresolved discrepancies are escalated to the AP Supervisor.  
- In rare cases, the Manager rejects invoices due to budget concerns, requiring further investigation.

### **Key Decision Points (Gateways):**  
1. **PO Presence Check** – Is the invoice linked to a valid PO?  
2. **Invoice Matching by Purchasing** – Does the invoice align with the PO details?  
3. **Discrepancy Handling** – Can the discrepancy be resolved between AP, Purchasing, and the supplier?  
4. **Manager Approval** – Does the invoice meet all conditions for approval?
