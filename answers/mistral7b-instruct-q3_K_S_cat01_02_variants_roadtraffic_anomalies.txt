The main anomalies in the data are:

1. The frequency of some events is very high, which could be a result of data entry errors or an indication that the process needs to be optimized. For example, "Insert Fine Notification" has a frequency of 64897335.862 and "Add Penalty" has a frequency of 36192968.793, which is very high compared to other events.
2. Some events have negative performance, such as "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Payment" with a negative performance of -26041072.856 and "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Add Penalty" with a negative performance of -22360235.385. This could indicate a problem with the process or an error in the data entry.
3. Some events have very high performance, such as "Send for Credit Collection" with a performance of 98982000.000 and "Appeal to Judge -> Send for Credit Collection" with a performance of 54709714.286. This could indicate that these events are taking up a lot of resources or processing time.
4. There is a significant overlap between some events, such as "Create Fine -> Insert Fine Notification" and "Insert Fine Notification", and "Send Fine -> Payment" and "Payment". This suggests that there may be some redundancy in the process or that these events are being counted multiple times.
