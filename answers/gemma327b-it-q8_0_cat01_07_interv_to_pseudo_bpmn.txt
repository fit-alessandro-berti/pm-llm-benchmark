**Notes/Ambiguities:**

*   The exact flow after a Manager rejection is somewhat unclear. It loops back to discrepancy resolution, but the level of investigation may vary.
*   The Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) is involved in resolving discrepancies but doesn't directly participate in the core process flow.
*   The process assumes a valid PO exists. The handling of invoices *without* a PO is more complex and relies heavily on the Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).
*   The system automation of sending for Manager Approval is mentioned, but the specific system details are not provided.
