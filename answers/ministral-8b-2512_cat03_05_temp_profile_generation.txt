Here’s a Python dictionary representing a **temporal profile** for the global supply chain process, including both directly connected and eventually following activity pairs. The values are estimated based on typical industry timelines and variability (e.g., supplier lead times, manufacturing stages, logistics delays). The standard deviations reflect real-world variability due to factors like supplier reliability, production bottlenecks, or external disruptions.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected pairs (immediate transitions)

    ('OP', 'RC'): (172800, 21600),   # Order placement  Receive components (2 days ± 6 hours)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 1800),      # Receive components  Quality inspection (1 hour ± 30 min)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (7200, 2160),      # Quality inspection  Component assembly (2 hours ± 36 min)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 5400),     # Component assembly  Product testing (6 hours ± 90 min)

### Key Observations:
1. **Direct Pairs**: Times are based on typical industry lead times (e.g., supplier lead times for `OPRC`).
2. **Eventual Pairs**: Calculated by summing intermediate steps (e.g., `SSPT` = `SSOP` + `OPRC` + `RCQI` + `QICA` + `CAPT`).
3. **Standard Deviations**: Reflect variability in each step (e.g., supplier delays, production bottlenecks). For eventual pairs, standard deviations are aggregated in quadrature (root-sum-square) to account for compounded uncertainty.
4. **Complexity**: Includes pairs spanning multiple stages (e.g., `SSDT` or `QIAS`) to capture long-term dependencies.

This profile can be used to detect anomalies (e.g., if `OPRC` takes > `172800 + 3*ZETA*21600` seconds). Adjust `ZETA` (e.g., 1, 2, or 3) to control sensitivity.
