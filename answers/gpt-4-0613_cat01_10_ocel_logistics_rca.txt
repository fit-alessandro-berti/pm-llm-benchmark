The performance issues in this process could be due to several reasons:

1. High Duration of Certain Events: Certain events, such as "pay order" -> "pick item" or "package delivered" -> "payment reminder", have high durations. Waiting times between these steps in the processes may lead to efficiency and perrformance issues.

2. High Frequency of Certain Events: Some events occur at high frequency, including "pick item" -> "create package", "confirm order" -> "pick item", and "place order" -> "pick item". If these events are unoptimized or cause bottlenecks, they could significantly impact overall process performance.

3. High number of objects: More processing time is required for events with higher number of objects. For example, the event "create package" -> "send package" involves a high number of objects (7100). This could be contributing to the overall processing time.

4. Inefficient Ordering of Events: The sequence in which events occur can affect performance. For example, the event "confirm order" -> "create package" seems less frequent but its duration is significantly high. Given that, this event sequence may need to be reviewed and optimized for better performance.

5. Repeating Events: Some events are repeated often, such as "pick item" -> "pick item", and these could point to inefficiencies or improper design in the event sequence.

6. High Frequency of Unnecessary Events: Events such as "item out of stock" -> "reorder item" could indicate out-of-stock situations that lead to delays and hence could contribute to performance issues.

These potential issues would need to be investigated and validated with additional data or by conducting detailed process reviews.
