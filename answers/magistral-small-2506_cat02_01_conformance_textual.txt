### Analysis of the Event Log Against the Normative Process

Let's analyze each case one by one and check for deviations from the normative process.

#### **Case 1 (ID: 1)**
Sequence:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Package items
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Conclusion:** This case follows the expected flow for a successful order fulfillment. No violations.

#### **Case 2 (ID: 2)**
Sequence:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Package items
4. Authorize payment
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Violation:** The activity "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which violates the rule that payment authorization should happen before packaging.

#### **Case 3 (ID: 3)**
Sequence:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Cancel order
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Violations:**
1. After "Cancel order," the process should directly go to "Close order." However, this case proceeds to "Ship order" after cancellation, which is illogical and violates the rule that shipping should never occur after cancellation.
2. Even if we ignore the "Cancel order" step, the sequence "Authorize payment" -> "Cancel order" -> "Ship order" is not described in the normative process. The correct flow after cancellation should be "Close order," not "Ship order."

#### **Case 4 (ID: 4)**
Sequence:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Cancel order
4. Close order

**Conclusion:** This case perfectly follows the expected flow for an order that is canceled due to insufficient inventory. No violations.

#### **Case 5 (ID: 5)**
Sequence:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Ship order
5. Close order

**Violation:** The activity "Ship order" occurs before "Package items," which violates the rule that packaging must happen before shipping.

### Summary of Violations:
1. **Case 2 (ID: 2)**
   - Violation: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
   - Normative Rule Violated: "Authorize payment" should happen before "Package items."

2. **Case 3 (ID: 3)**
   - Violation 1: "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
     - Normative Rule Violated: Shipping should never happen after cancellation. After cancellation, the only next step should be "Close order."
   - Violation 2: The sequence "Authorize payment" -> "Cancel order" -> "Ship order" is not described in the normative process. Even if we ignore the first violation, this is still not a valid flow.

3. **Case 5 (ID: 5)**
   - Violation: "Ship order" occurs before "Package items."
   - Normative Rule Violated: Items must be packaged before they can be shipped.

### Final Answer:
The cases that deviate from the normative process are:
- **Case 2 (ID: 2):** "Package items" is performed before "Authorize payment."
- **Case 3 (ID: 3):** After canceling the order, the process incorrectly proceeds to "Ship order" instead of "Close order."
- **Case 5 (ID: 5):** "Ship order" is performed before "Package items."

The valid cases are:
- Case 1 (ID: 1) and Case 4 (ID: 4) follow the expected flows for successful and canceled orders, respectively.
