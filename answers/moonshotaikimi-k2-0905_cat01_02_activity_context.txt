Why these renames?  
Three activities repeat inside a single ticket:

1. “Verify Documents” – the first run is performed while information is still incomplete; the second only happens after additional data / an account correction is available. Prefixes (“1st Pass”, “Re-check”, “Physical”) make this timing and state-change visible at a glance.

2. “Call Customer” – the first call is always made to solve a concrete problem supplied in the event context (missing docs, discrepancy, or bringing customer back). Tagging the call with that problem (“– Missing Docs”, “– Clarify Discrepancy”, “– Recall Customer”) preserves both the communication step and the reason the step exists.

3. “Initiate Request” – different channels (online vs branch) influence downstream steps, so we qualify it by channel.

With these new names the log becomes process-mining-ready: no two differently purposed rows share the same activity label within a case.
