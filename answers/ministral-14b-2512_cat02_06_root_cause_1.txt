### **1. Identifying Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**
First, let's calculate the **total resolution time** (from **Receive Ticket** to **Close Ticket**) for each case:

| **Case ID** | **Receive Ticket**       | **Close Ticket**         | **Total Resolution Time** |
|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 101         | 2024-03-01 08:00        | 2024-03-01 10:15        | **2 hours 15 minutes**   |
| 102         | 2024-03-01 08:05        | 2024-03-02 09:15        | **~25 hours 10 minutes** |
| 103         | 2024-03-01 08:10        | 2024-03-01 09:30        | **1 hour 20 minutes**    |
| 104         | 2024-03-01 08:20        | 2024-03-02 08:30        | **~24 hours 10 minutes** |
| 105         | 2024-03-01 08:25        | 2024-03-03 09:30        | **~49 hours 5 minutes**  |

**Observation:**
- **Case 105** has the longest resolution time (**~49 hours**), followed by **Case 104 (~24 hours)** and **Case 102 (~25 hours)**.
- **Cases 101 and 103** resolve within **2-3 hours**, which is significantly faster.

---

### **2. Determining Root Causes of Delays**
Now, let's analyze the **event sequences** for the slowest cases to identify bottlenecks:

#### **Case 105 (49 hours)**
- **Receive Ticket  Triage Ticket**: **10 min** (normal)
- **Triage  Assign to Level-1 Agent**: **25 min** (normal)
- **Assign  Investigate Issue**: **40 min** (normal)
- **Investigate  Escalate to Level-2 Agent**: **~1 hour 50 min** (unusually long delay before escalation)
- **Escalate  Level-2 Investigation**: **~36 hours** (extremely long)
- **Level-2 Investigation  Resolve**: **~16 hours** (long)
- **Resolve  Close**: **30 min** (normal)

**Key Issues:**
- **Unusually long delay (1h 50m) between "Investigate Issue" and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent"** (possibly due to Level-1 agent hesitation or lack of clarity on escalation criteria).
- **Level-2 investigation took ~36 hours**, which is **far longer than Level-1 investigations** (e.g., Case 101: 1h, Case 103: 30m).
- **Resolution after escalation took ~16 hours**, suggesting **complexity or lack of expertise** in Level-2.

#### **Case 104 (~24 hours)**
- **Receive  Triage**: **40 min** (normal)
- **Triage  Assign**: **30 min** (normal)
- **Assign  Investigate**: **3h 30m** (longer than usual)
- **Investigate  Resolve**: **~23 hours** (extremely long)
- **Resolve  Close**: **30 min** (normal)

**Key Issues:**
- **Investigation took 3h 30m** (vs. ~1h in Case 101, ~30m in Case 103).
- **Resolution took ~23 hours**, suggesting **either:**
  - The issue was **highly complex** and required **multiple attempts**.
  - The **Level-1 agent lacked sufficient expertise** and could not resolve it quickly.
  - **Waiting for external dependencies** (e.g., another team, approvals).

#### **Case 102 (~25 hours)**
- **Receive  Triage**: **25 min** (normal)
- **Triage  Assign**: **30 min** (normal)
- **Assign  Escalate to Level-2**: **2h 30m** (longer than usual)
- **Escalate  Level-2 Investigation**: **~11 hours** (long)
- **Level-2 Investigation  Resolve**: **~14 hours** (long)
- **Resolve  Close**: **15 min** (normal)

**Key Issues:**
- **Escalation happened quickly (2h 30m after assignment)**, but **Level-2 investigation was slow (~11h)**.
- **Resolution after Level-2 took ~14 hours**, suggesting **complexity or coordination delays**.

### **3. Common Patterns Leading to Delays**
From the analysis, the **primary causes of delays** are:

| **Bottleneck** | **Examples** | **Possible Causes** |
|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Escalation Delays** | Case 105 (1h 50m before escalation), Case 102 (2h 30m before escalation) | - Level-1 agents **hesitate to escalate** due to unclear criteria. <br> - **No clear SLA for escalation**, leading to unnecessary delays. |
| **Level-2 Investigation Delays** | Case 105 (~36h), Case 102 (~11h) | - **Specialized teams are overloaded** or have **longer response times**. <br> - **Lack of urgency** in Level-2 due to poor handoff from Level-1. |
| **Long Level-1 Investigation Times** | Case 104 (3h 30m) | - **Agent inexperience** with the issue type. <br> - **Lack of knowledge base/tools** to resolve quickly. <br> - **Waiting for internal approvals/dependencies**. |
| **Resolution Delays After Escalation** | Case 105 (~16h), Case 102 (~14h) | - **Complex issues requiring multiple steps**. <br> - **Poor communication between Level-1 and Level-2**. <br> - **Level-2 agents working on multiple high-priority cases**. |

### **4. Recommendations to Improve Performance**
#### **A. Reduce Escalation Delays**
 **Define Clear Escalation Criteria**
   - Set **time-based SLAs** (e.g., "Escalate if not resolved within 1 hour").
   - Use **automated alerts** when a ticket exceeds a threshold.

 **Improve Level-1 Agent Training**
   - Provide **better guidance on when to escalate** (e.g., "If the issue requires X steps, escalate immediately").
   - Use **decision trees or AI-assisted triage** to recommend escalation.

 **Streamline Handoff to Level-2**
   - Ensure **Level-2 agents receive all necessary context** (e.g., previous attempts, logs).
   - Assign **dedicated Level-2 agents** for urgent cases.

#### **B. Speed Up Level-2 Investigations**
 **Prioritize Escalated Tickets**
   - **Flag escalated tickets as "High Priority"** in the queue.
   - **Assign Level-2 agents with SLA targets** (e.g., "Resolve within 4 hours").

 **Improve Specialized Team Capacity**
   - **Hire more Level-2 agents** or **cross-train Level-1 agents** on common escalations.
   - **Use knowledge bases** to help Level-2 agents resolve issues faster.

 **Automate Repetitive Escalation Work**
   - If certain issues **always escalate**, **pre-assign them to Level-2** instead of waiting.

#### **C. Optimize Level-1 Resolution**
 **Provide Better Tools & Knowledge**
   - **Implement a self-service knowledge base** (FAQs, troubleshooting guides).
   - **Use AI chatbots** to assist Level-1 agents in resolving common issues.

 **Monitor Agent Performance**
   - **Identify underperforming agents** and provide **additional training**.
   - **Rotate complex cases** among agents to prevent bottlenecks.

 **Reduce Dependencies**
   - **Minimize approval steps** that delay resolution.
   - **Pre-approve common fixes** for repetitive issues.

#### **D. Track & Analyze Bottlenecks**
 **Implement Process Mining**
   - Use **data analytics** to **identify recurring delays** (e.g., "Most escalations happen after 2 hours").
   - **Set up dashboards** to monitor **average resolution times by activity**.

 **Conduct Root Cause Analysis (RCA) on Slow Cases**
   - For **each long-resolution case**, ask:
     - Was the issue **too complex**?
     - Was there **poor communication** between levels?
     - Were **external dependencies** the cause?

 **A/B Test Process Improvements**
   - Example: **"If we escalate within 30 minutes instead of 2 hours, does resolution time improve?"**

### **5. Expected Outcomes of These Changes**
| **Action** | **Expected Impact** |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Faster Escalations** | Reduces **Case 105-like delays** by 50%. |
| **Level-2 Priority Handling** | Cuts **Level-2 investigation time** from ~36h to ~4-6h. |
| **Better Level-1 Tools** | Reduces **Case 104-like investigation times** by 70%. |
| **Automated Handoffs** | Eliminates **unnecessary delays** in escalation. |
| **Performance Tracking** | Enables **data-driven optimizations** over time. |

---
### **Final Summary**
The **biggest delays** in this process come from:
1. **Slow escalations** (Level-1 hesitation).
2. **Long Level-2 investigation times** (specialized team bottlenecks).
3. **Complex issues requiring multiple steps** (lack of expertise or tools).

**Key Fixes:**
 **Speed up escalations** (clearer criteria, automated alerts).
 **Prioritize Level-2 work** (SLAs, dedicated agents).
 **Empower Level-1 agents** (better training, tools).
 **Monitor & optimize** using process analytics.

By implementing these changes, **average resolution time could drop from ~25-49 hours to under 6 hours**, significantly improving customer satisfaction.
