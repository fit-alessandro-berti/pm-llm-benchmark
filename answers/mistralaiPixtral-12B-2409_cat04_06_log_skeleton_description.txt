Based on the provided declarative constraints in the Log Skeleton process model, we can infer the underlying process. Here's a description of the process:

1. **Submission and Initial Approval:**
   - The process begins with the employee submitting a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).
   - The declaration can then be approved by the pre-approver (`Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`) or rejected by the pre-approver (`Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`).

2. **Supervisor Approval and Rejection:**
   - If approved by the pre-approver, the declaration can be further approved by the supervisor (`Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`) or rejected by the supervisor (`Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`).
   - If rejected by the pre-approver, it can be further rejected by the administration (`Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`).

3. **Budget Owner Approval and Rejection:**
   - If approved by the supervisor, the declaration can be approved by the budget owner (`Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`) or rejected by the budget owner (`Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`).
   - If rejected by the supervisor, it can be further rejected by the budget owner.

4. **Final Approval:**
   - If approved by the budget owner, the declaration can be finally approved by the supervisor (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).

5. **Rejection by Missing Information:**
   - At any stage, if there is missing information, the declaration can be rejected (`Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`).

6. **Employee Actions:**
   - The employee can save the declaration (`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`) and submit it multiple times (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).
   - The employee can also request payment (`Request Payment`) and handle the payment (`Payment Handled`).

7. **Rejection by Employee:**
   - The employee can reject the declaration (`Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`).

8. **Directly-Follows Constraints:**
   - `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR` directly follows `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`.
   - `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER` directly follows `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`.

9. **Activity Occurrences:**
   - Some activities can occur multiple times, such as `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`, `Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`, `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`, etc.
   - Other activities can only occur once, such as `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`, `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, `Request Payment`, and `Payment Handled`.

10. **Never Together Constraints:**
    - Certain activities cannot co-exist within the same case, indicating that some combinations of activities are not possible.

In summary, the process involves multiple stages of approval and rejection by different roles, with the possibility of multiple submissions and actions by the employee. The final goal seems to be the final approval of the declaration by the supervisor.
