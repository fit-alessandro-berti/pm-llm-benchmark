### **Key Elements of the Diagram**
1. **Swimlanes**:
   - The process is divided into two swimlanes:
     - **Logistics**: Handles order details, insurance, shipment labeling, and selecting a logistics company.
     - **Warehouse**: Handles packaging, notification of delays, and final shipment preparation.

2. **Start Event**: 
   - The process starts with the **"Ship goods"** event.

3. **Tasks & Decision Points**:
   - **Clarify shipment method**: Determines if special handling is required.
     - If **yes**, three offers from logistics companies are obtained, and a company is selected.
     - If **no**, the process continues without this step.
   - **Check if insurance is required**: Based on customer information, the system determines whether the parcel needs insurance.
     - If necessary, the package is insured.
   - **Write package label**: Always done for every shipment.
   - **Package goods**: Takes **48 hours** to complete.
     - If delayed, the customer is notified.
   - **Fill out shipment paperwork**: Required for all shipments.
   - **Move package to pickup area**: The final step before the shipment is prepared.

4. **Gateways (Decisions)**:
   - **Special handling?** (Yes/No) → Determines whether additional logistics offers need to be obtained.
   - **Insurance necessary?** (Yes/No) → Determines if the parcel requires insurance.
   - **Synchronization gateways**: Merge multiple paths before proceeding to the next step.

5. **End Event**: 
   - The process ends with **"Shipment prepared"**, indicating that the package is ready for pickup.
