Here is a case-by-case audit of the three cases against the strict normative sequence and the non-strict desiderata.

Part 1. Violations of the normative (strict) rules

Normative sequence to enforce:
Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case
Rules:
- Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment.
- Risk Assessment must come before Loan Decision.
- Inform Applicant must come after Loan Decision.
- If Approved, Finalize Documentation must occur before Close Case.
- If Rejected, do not finalize Documentation before closing.

Case 1
- Status: Compliant.
- Why: Follows the exact sequence: Application Received (09:00) -> Credit Check (09:30) -> Risk Assessment (10:00) -> Loan Decision (Approved) (11:00) -> Inform Applicant (13:00) -> Finalize Documentation (13:30) -> Close Case (14:00). Approval path has Finalize Documentation before Close Case. No violations of ordering or conditional rules.

Case 2
- Status: Violations (multiple).
- Violations:
  1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check: Risk Assessment occurs at 08:20, but Credit Check occurs later at 09:00. This reverses the required order.
  2) Finalize Documentation after Rejection: Loan Decision is Rejected at 09:30, but Finalize Documentation occurs at 10:00. The rule says, on rejection, do not finalize documentation before closing.
  3) Missing Inform Applicant step: After the Loan Decision (Rejected) there is no Inform Applicant event before closing, which violates the required post-decision notification step.
- Summary: Case 2 breaches the strict ordering, the conditional rule for rejections, and the mandatory Inform Applicant step.

Case 3
- Status: Compliant (normative rules satisfied).
- Why: The sequence is intact: Application Received (09:00) -> Credit Check (10:00) -> Risk Assessment (11:00) -> Loan Decision (Approved) (12:00) -> Inform Applicant (16:00) -> Finalize Documentation (17:00) -> Close Case (10:00 on 01-17). Note: There is one potential practical issue to consider (see Part 2), but in terms of the strict normative rules, the order and the conditional path (Approved  Finalize before Close) are satisfied. There is no Finalize after rejection, and Inform Applicant occurs after the decision.

Part 2. Desiderata (recommended but not strictly required)

Desiderata (examples given):
- Credit Check should be completed within a short window after application (e.g., within 24 hours).
- Inform Applicant should occur promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision).
- Optional but encouraged: a Follow-up Call to the applicant sometime before closing the case.

Case 1
- Desiderata status: Mostly satisfied.
- Why: Credit Check completed well within 24 hours (0.5 hours after Application Received). Inform Applicant occurred within 2 hours of the Loan Decision, well within 48 hours. Follow-up Call is not present, but this is an optional step; its absence is not a hard violation.

Case 2
- Desiderata status: Mixed; not a severe violation, but has misses.
- Why:
  - Credit Check timing: The credit check occurred within 1 hour of application, so it meets the 24-hour desideratum.
  - Inform Applicant: Not present at all; this is not aligned with the recommended practice (informing promptly) but is categorized as a desideratum (not a hard rule). The absence is a design gap, contributing to suboptimal timeliness.
  - Follow-up Call: Not present; since this is only a desideratum, its absence is not a severe violation, but it is a missed opportunity for alignment.

Case 3
- Desiderata status: Violations (timing) for two items; and no Follow-up Call.
- Why:
  - Credit Check timing: 2 days after application (more than 24 hours) violates the 24-hour desideratum.
  - Inform Applicant timing: Inform occurred about 3 days after the decision (Decision 12:00 on 01-12, Inform 01-16 15:00), which exceeds the 48-hour window.
  - Follow-up Call: Not performed; again, this is a desideratum (encouraged but not required).
- Overall: Not a hard rule violation, but clearly suboptimal with respect to the timing recommendations.

Part 3. Interpretations, justifications, and possible fixes

Case 1 (compliant case)
- Interpretation: The workflow behaved as intended with clean handoffs and an approved path that ends with documented closure after finalization. It indicates a well-configured process where the system enforces the ordering and the conditional flow.
- Suggestions: Maintain this configuration; consider adding automated SLA monitoring to ensure the timing of the desiderata remains favorable.

Case 2 (serious normative violations)
- Possible causes:
  - Misconfigured workflow: Risk Assessment started before Credit Check due to a misrouting rule or an overridden/manual step.
  - Human error: Staff manually processed risk evaluation in parallel with or before obtaining credit data.
  - Policy ambiguity: The team might have believed Risk Assessment could begin with partial data, but the normative rule forbids it.
  - Rejection handling error: The team proceeded to Finalize Documentation despite rejection, perhaps due to a misinterpretation of closing procedures.
  - Inform Applicant omission: There may have been an assumption that notification would occur automatically later or via a different channel.
- Remedies:
  - Implement strict workflow guards that prevent advancing to Risk Assessment before Credit Check.
  - Enforce that on rejection, the system blocks Finalize Documentation and requires Inform Applicant prior to Close Case.
  - Enforce mandatory Inform Applicant as part of the decision path.
  - Introduce automated checks and an audit trail to flag such deviations immediately.
  - Provide user training and quick-reference rules to ensure staff understand the non-negotiable steps.
- Rationale: These constraints are designed to ensure data integrity (credit data must be evaluated before risk decisions) and to guarantee applicants receive timely notification. The observed sequence breaks trust in progress tracking and could lead to regulatory or customer-service problems.

Case 3 (normative-compliant but desiderata-weak)
- Possible causes:
  - Backlog or data retrieval delays: The 2-day gap before the credit check suggests data collection or system processing delays.
  - Scheduling or resource constraints: Informing the applicant and closing kept waiting for availability or manual approvals.
  - Follow-up planning: The absence of a follow-up call may reflect a design choice to minimize contact unless needed, or simply a missed step.
- Remedies:
  - Introduce SLA monitoring for the 24-hour credit check and the 48-hour inform window; alert and escalate if approaching deadlines.
  - Automate notification prompts so Inform Applicant is triggered promptly after the decision.
  - Consider adding an optional, lightweight follow-up task that can be scheduled automatically before closing if the case status allows.
  - If delays are legitimate (e.g., data source downtime), log the cause in the case notes and adjust SLAs accordingly or implement exception-handling rules.
- Rationale: The sequence is correct, but timing drifts reduce customer responsiveness and experience. Desiderata are there to optimize efficiency and customer satisfaction; systematically tracking them helps prevent suboptimal performance.

Concrete quick recommendations (actionable)
- Implement a rules engine that enforces the strict order and conditional steps (Credit Check -> Risk Assessment -> Loan Decision -> Inform Applicant -> (Approved: Finalize Documentation) -> Close Case). Any attempt to advance out of order or finalize docs after a rejection should be blocked with a clear error.
- Enforce mandatory Inform Applicant whenever a Loan Decision occurs (both Approved and Rejected paths).
- Add automated reminders and SLAs for desiderata:
  - Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received.
  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision.
  - Optional Follow-up Call before closing; if used, schedule automatically.
- Introduce a case-age or backlog monitor so long delays trigger escalations and possible process optimization.
- Improve auditability: ensure every deviation (even those later corrected) is recorded with a rationale and responsible party.

Summary
- Normative violations: Case 1 compliant; Case 2 clearly violates ordering, rejection-handling, and mandatory informing; Case 3 compliant with the strict rules.
- Desiderata: Case 1 generally respects timing; Case 2 meets the credit-check timing but misses Inform Applicant and Follow-up (desiderata miss); Case 3 misses multiple timing desiderata and lacks a follow-up call.
- Interpretations and fixes: Use automated enforcement of the strict sequence, mandatory steps, and SLAs; explain deviations when they occur, but aim to minimize them with process improvements and better tooling.
