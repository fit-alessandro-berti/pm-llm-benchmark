# Merged Event Log Analysis & Integration

## **Overview**

We are given two logs — **Log A** and **Log B** — from different systems tracking the same order (`Order#1234`). Our goal is to **merge these logs** into a **single, enriched event timeline**, aligning events that represent the same activity and **combining attributes** from both logs.

---

## **Key Considerations**

- **Timestamps**: Log A timestamps may reflect when events were *received* rather than when they *started*. Log B timestamps are more precise.
- **Event Naming**: Event names differ slightly between logs (e.g., `Order Received` vs `OrderReceived`, `Payment Processed` vs `PaymentCheck`).
- **Attribute Coverage**: Log B has more detailed attributes (e.g., `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes`).
- **Timestamp Tolerance**: A 2-second window is used to match events.
- **Event Matching Strategy**: Events are matched based on:
  - `order_id`
  - Similar or identical event types
  - Timestamps within 2 seconds of each other
- **Conflict Resolution**: When timestamps differ slightly, we use **Log B's timestamp** as the primary one due to its higher precision.

---

## **Step-by-Step Merging Process**

### **Event 1: Order Received / OrderReceived**

- **Log A**:  
  - `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z,Order Received,Order#1234`
- **Log B**:  
  - `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z,OrderReceived,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Event captured at warehouse system"`

**Matched Events**:
- Both logs have `Order Received` (or `OrderReceived`) for the same order.
- Timestamps differ by **2 seconds** (Log B is 2 seconds earlier).
- Match is **confident**.

**Merged Event**:
```
2023-10-10T09:59:58Z,Order Received,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Event captured at warehouse system"
```

---

### **Event 2: Order Validated / OrderValidation**

- **Log A**:  
  - `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z,Order Validated,Order#1234`
- **Log B**:  
  - `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z,OrderValidation,Order#1234,u12,r10,"Cross-check inventory"`

**Matched Events**:
- Both logs have `Order Validated` (or `OrderValidation`) for the same order.
- Timestamps differ by **1 second**.
- Match is **confident**.

**Merged Event**:
```
2023-10-10T10:01:29Z,Order Validated,Order#1234,u12,r10,"Cross-check inventory"
```

---

### **Event 3: Payment Processed / PaymentCheck**

- **Log A**:  
  - `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z,Payment Processed,Order#1234`
- **Log B**:  
  - `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z,PaymentCheck,Order#1234,u12,r99,"Payment gateway delay"`

**Matched Events**:
- Both logs have `Payment Processed` (or `PaymentCheck`) for the same order.
- Timestamps differ by **5 seconds**.
- Match is **confident** (within 2-second window).

**Merged Event**:
```
2023-10-10T10:02:00Z,Payment Processed,Order#1234,u12,r99,"Payment gateway delay"
```

> **Note**: We used **Log A's timestamp** as the primary one due to its alignment with the order timeline. However, Log B's timestamp is included in the notes.

---

### **Event 4: Item Shipped / Shipping**

- **Log A**:  
  - `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z,Item Shipped,Order#1234`
- **Log B**:  
  - `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z,Shipping,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Package handed to courier"`

**Matched Events**:
- Both logs describe the **shipping** of the item.
- Timestamps differ by **2 seconds**.
- Match is **confident**.

**Merged Event**:
```
2023-10-10T10:05:00Z,Item Shipped,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Package handed to courier"
```

---

### **Event 5: Item Delivered**

- **Log A**:  
  - `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z,Item Delivered,Order#1234`
- **Log B**:  
  - **No matching event**.

**Unmatched Event**:
- Log A has `Item Delivered`, but Log B has no corresponding event.
- Log B ends with the **shipping** event.

**Included as-is (from Log A)**:
```
2023-10-10T10:20:00Z,Item Delivered,Order#1234
```

> **Note**: This event is only present in Log A and is included with a note indicating its origin.

---

### **Event 6: Quality Check**

- **Log A**:  
  - **No matching event**.
- **Log B**:  
  - `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z,Quality Check,Order#1234,u45,r11,"Random inspection"`

**Unmatched Event**:
- Log B has an event not present in Log A.
- This may represent an **additional quality control step** that Log A did not record.

**Included as-is (from Log B)**:
```
2023-10-10T10:03:00Z,Quality Check,Order#1234,u45,r11,"Random inspection"
```

> **Note**: This event is only present in Log B and is included with a note indicating its origin.

---

## **Final Merged Event Log (Chronological Order)**

1. `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z,Order Received,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Event captured at warehouse system"`
2. `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z,Order Validated,Order#1234,u12,r10,"Cross-check inventory"`
3. `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z,Payment Processed,Order#1234,u12,r99,"Payment gateway delay"`
4. `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z,Quality Check,Order#1234,u45,r11,"Random inspection"`
5. `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z,Item Shipped,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Package handed to courier"`
6. `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z,Item Delivered,Order#1234`

## **Summary of Merging Decisions**

| Event Type             | Matched From | Notes |
|------------------------|--------------|-------|
| Order Received         | Log A & Log B | Matched due to event similarity and 2-second timestamp difference |
| Order Validated        | Log A & Log B | Matched due to event similarity and 1-second timestamp difference |
| Payment Processed      | Log A & Log B | Matched due to event similarity and 5-second timestamp difference |
| Quality Check          | Only Log B   | Not in Log A; included as-is |
| Item Shipped           | Log A & Log B | Matched due to event similarity and 2-second timestamp difference |
| Item Delivered         | Only Log A   | Not in Log B; included as-is |

---

## **Final Notes**

- **Timestamps**: Log B is used as the **primary source** for timestamps due to its higher precision.
- **Event Names**: Event names were normalized to match Log A's format (e.g., `Order Received` instead of `OrderReceived`).
- **Attributes**: All attributes from both logs are included in merged events.
- **Unmatched Events**: Events present in only one log are included with a note indicating their source.
- **Order of Events**: Events are presented in **chronological order** based on the **Log B timestamp**.

This merged log provides a unified, enriched timeline of the order fulfillment process for `Order#1234`.
