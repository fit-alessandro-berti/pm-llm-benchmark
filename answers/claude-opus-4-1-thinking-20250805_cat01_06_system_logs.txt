## Explanation of Transformation Logic

**Case Identification Strategy:**
I identified five distinct cases based on the primary work object (document, email, or spreadsheet) that the user was interacting with:
- **QR_2024_001**: Quarterly Report editing session
- **DOC_2024_001**: New document creation and editing
- **EMAIL_2024_001**: Email handling for Annual Meeting
- **PDF_2024_001**: PDF report review and annotation
- **BUDGET_2024_001**: Budget spreadsheet update

**Activity Naming Convention:**
I transformed low-level system actions into business-meaningful activities:
- FOCUS events became "Open [Document Type]" or "Resume [Task]" depending on context
- TYPING events were mapped to specific content activities like "Draft Introduction" or "Update Q1 Data"
- SAVE events consistently became "Save [Document Type]"
- Email-related CLICK events were interpreted as email workflow steps
- CLOSE events became "Complete [Task]" to indicate task completion

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Case continuity**: When the user returned to Document1.docx after working on the budget, I continued the same case (DOC_2024_001) rather than creating a new one, as it represents ongoing work on the same document.
2. **Activity granularity**: I chose a medium level of abstraction that balances detail with readability, making the log suitable for process mining analysis while maintaining business context.
3. **Temporal coherence**: Events are ordered chronologically within and across cases, preserving the actual work pattern of task-switching that characterizes modern knowledge work.

This event log now provides a clear narrative of a knowledge worker's morning session, showing how they manage multiple documents and tasks in parallel, suitable for process mining analysis to identify work patterns, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities.
