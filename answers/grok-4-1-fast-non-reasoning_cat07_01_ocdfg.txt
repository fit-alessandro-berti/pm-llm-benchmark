### Overview
This is a **flowchart depicting an e-commerce order fulfillment process**, likely for an online retail system. It illustrates the workflow from initial purchase to delivery and closure, including purchase order handling, sales processing, inventory management, and returns. The diagram uses colored rectangles for process steps, diamonds for decisions, arrows for flow direction, and labeled "Start" and "End" nodes. It's structured in a grid-like layout with parallel branches for sales and purchase orders.

### Key Layout and Color Coding
- **Horizontal sections**: Divided into columns/rows for **Purchase Order**, **Sales Order**, **Inventory**, and **Delivery** processes.
- **Colors** (consistent legend implied):
  - **Purple**: Purchase-related (e.g., "Purchase Requisition", "Check PO").
  - **Blue**: Core processing (e.g., "Create Invoice", "Approve Payment").
  - **Green**: Approval/processing (e.g., "Process Order").
  - **Orange**: Order/delivery steps (e.g., "Pack Goods", "Customer Delivery").
  - **Pink/Red**: Returns (e.g., "Return Order").
  - **Gray/Dark**: Starts, Ends, and decisions.
- **Arrows**: Solid lines with labels (e.g., "200 min", "300 min") indicating flow and possibly durations/timings. Directions are mostly rightward and downward, with loops for approvals/returns.

### Main Process Flow (Left to Right, Top to Bottom)
1. **Purchase Order Branch (Left Side)**:
   - Starts with **Purchase Requisition** (purple).
   - Flows to **Create PO**  **Check PO** (purple diamond decision).
   - Yes  **Approve PO** (green)  Merges into inventory.
   - No  Loops back or ends.

2. **Sales Order Branch (Top Center)**:
   - **Start**  **Sales Order** (purple)  **Create Order** (orange).
   - Branches to **Process Order** (green diamond)  **Approve Payment** (blue)  **Create Invoice** (blue).

3. **Inventory and Packing (Center)**:
   - Converges from sales/purchase: **Check Stock** (purple diamond).
   - Yes  **Pack Goods** (orange)  **Step 3** (orange).
   - No  Triggers **Purchase Order** loop.

4. **Delivery and Closure (Right Side)**:
   - **Customer Delivery** (orange)  **Close Order** (orange)  **End**.
   - Parallel: **Return Order** (pink)  **Return Goods**  Loops back to inventory or ends.

5. **Returns and Loops (Bottom)**:
   - Dedicated **Return Order** path from sales, feeding back into **Inventory**.
   - Multiple **End** nodes for successful closures (order, delivery, invoice).

### Notable Features
- **Decision Points**: Diamonds like "Check PO", "Check Stock", "Process Order?" with Yes/No branches.
- **Loops**: For approvals (e.g., payment/invoice) and returns, ensuring iterative handling.
- **Timings**: Arrows labeled "100 min", "200 min", "300 min", "400 min", "500 min" suggest process durations.
- **Parallelism**: Sales and purchase orders run somewhat independently but sync at inventory/delivery.
- **Ends**: Four "End" points for different termination scenarios (e.g., order close, delivery, returns).

This flowchart models a robust, cyclical e-commerce workflow emphasizing checks, approvals, and customer-centric steps like returns and delivery. If this is from a specific system (e.g., ERP like SAP), it resembles standard order-to-cash processes.
