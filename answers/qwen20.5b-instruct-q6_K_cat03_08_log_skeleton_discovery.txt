Sure, here is a possible log skeleton for the described process:

```python
# Create Fine
Create Fine -> Payment -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment -> Payment -> Payment -> Payment -> Payment -> Payment -> Payment (frequency = 49)
```

Note: Please replace the log lines with actual values and timestamps.
