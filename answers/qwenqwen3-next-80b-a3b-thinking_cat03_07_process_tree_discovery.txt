Okay, let's see. I need to create a process tree based on the given event log. Let me first understand the log's structure.

Looking at the data:

Case ID 1: RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC

Case ID 2: RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC (no RMI here)

Case ID 3: RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC

So, the main flow seems to be:

- Start with Receive Application (RA)
- Then Validate Form (VF)
- Assess Eligibility (AE)
- Then sometimes there's Request Missing Info (RMI), possibly multiple times, followed by re-validating (VF) again
- Then Approval Decision (AD), Send Confirmation (SC), Archive Case (AC)

In case 2, after AE, they go straight to AD without RMI. So RMI and the subsequent VF are optional. But when RMI happens, it can happen multiple times (like case 3 has two RMI events), each followed by VF again.

Wait, in case 3: after AE, they have RMI, then another RMI, then VF. Wait, no: the sequence for case 3 is:

RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC

So after AE, they do RMI (first time), then another RMI, then VF. So after each RMI, they have to validate again? Or maybe the RMI is followed by VF each time? Let's check:

Case 1: AE  RMI  VF  AD...

Case 3: AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD...

Wait, after the first RMI in case 3, they do another RMI before VF. Hmm. So maybe the RMI can happen multiple times, each time followed by VF? But in case 3, after the first RMI, they do another RMI, then VF. So maybe the VF comes after all the RMI steps. Or perhaps each RMI is followed by VF. Wait, in case 1: after RMI comes VF. In case 3: RMI, RMI, then VF. So perhaps after each RMI, they have to do VF again. But in case 3, after first RMI, they do another RMI before VF. That would mean that after RMI, they can either do another RMI (if more info is missing) or proceed to VF.

Wait, but after RMI, the next step is VF. So maybe the loop is: after AE, you can have a loop where you do RMI and then VF, and this can repeat. So each iteration of the loop consists of RMI followed by VF. But in case 3, after AE, they have RMI, RMI, VF. Wait, that doesn't fit. Let's see:

Case 3's sequence:

RA, VF, AE, RMI, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC.

So after AE, first RMI, then another RMI, then VF. So maybe the RMI can happen multiple times, and then VF. So perhaps the loop is that after AE, you can have a sequence of RMI's (multiple times), then VF. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the loop is RMI  VF, and this loop can happen multiple times. But in case 3, after AE, they have two RMI's, then VF. So that would mean that the loop is RMI followed by VF, but in this case, they did two RMI's before VF. Wait, but if the loop is RMI  VF, then each iteration would have RMI then VF. So for two iterations, it would be RMI  VF  RMI  VF. But in case 3, after AE, it's RMI  RMI  VF. That's two RMI's followed by VF. So that doesn't fit the RMI  VF loop.

Hmm. Maybe the structure is that after AE, you can have a loop where you do RMI, then possibly VF, but maybe the VF comes after all the RMI's. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the RMI is optional and can happen multiple times, and then VF is done once. But how?

Wait, perhaps after AE, there's a loop where you can do RMI and then VF. But in case 3, after AE, they have two RMI's and then VF. So that would be two iterations of RMI followed by VF? No, because then after first RMI and VF, then another RMI and VF. But in case 3, after the first RMI, they do another RMI before VF. So the sequence is RMI, RMI, VF. So maybe VF is only done once after all RMI's. So perhaps the loop is RMI repeated multiple times, then VF. But that's not a standard loop structure. Alternatively, maybe the loop is RMI followed by VF, but the VF is part of the loop. Wait, but if each loop iteration is RMI then VF, then for two iterations, it's RMI  VF  RMI  VF. But in case 3, it's RMI  RMI  VF. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe after AE, there's a loop that includes RMI and then possibly VF. Wait, perhaps the loop is: RMI and then VF, but maybe the VF is optional. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, looking at case 1: after AE, RMI  VF  AD. So after RMI, they validate again, then approve.

Case 3: after AE, RMI  RMI  VF  AD. So two RMI's, then VF. So perhaps the RMI can happen multiple times, and then VF. So the structure would be after AE, you have a loop where you can do RMI multiple times, and then VF. But how to model that?

Alternatively, perhaps the loop is RMI  (optional VF?), but no, because after RMI, they do VF again. Wait, but in case 3, after first RMI, they do another RMI, then VF. So maybe after RMI, you can either do another RMI or proceed to VF. So maybe the loop is: after AE, you have a loop where you do RMI, then either do another RMI or proceed to VF. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe the correct structure is that after AE, there's a loop that consists of RMI and then VF. But each time you do RMI, you must do VF. But in case 3, they have two RMI's followed by VF. So that would mean that after the first RMI, they don't do VF, but another RMI. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the loop is that you can have RMI followed by VF, but you can also have multiple RMI's before VF. So perhaps the structure is: after AE, you have a loop where you can do RMI any number of times, then VF. But how to model that with process tree operators.

Wait, maybe the loop is: a sequence where RMI can be repeated multiple times, then VF. So for example, (RMI)* followed by VF. But in process tree terms, how would that look?

But process trees use operators like * (loop), which is defined as A followed by either exit or B then A again. So for a loop that can have multiple RMI's and then VF, maybe it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the loop is: after AE, you have a loop where you do RMI and then VF, but you can loop multiple times. But then each loop iteration would have RMI then VF. So for example, RMI  VF  (loop again). But in case 3, the sequence after AE is RMI, RMI, VF. Which would not fit that. Because if the loop is RMI  VF, then each loop iteration would have both. So two iterations would be RMI  VF  RMI  VF. But case 3 has RMI  RMI  VF. So that's different.

Hmm. Maybe the structure is: after AE, there's a loop that can have RMI followed by an optional VF. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps after AE, you have a loop where you can do RMI, then either go back to the loop (do another RMI) or proceed to VF. So the loop structure would be: RMI  (X (loop, VF)). But not sure.

Alternatively, think of the loop as: after AE, you can have a sequence of RMI's, and then VF. So the RMI's can happen zero or more times, then VF. But how to model that.

Wait, in process tree terms, the * operator is defined as A executed, then either exit or B then A again. So for a loop that has A followed by B, then repeat.

But for example, * (A, B) means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So the loop structure would be A  (B  A)*.

Wait, let's see. The definition says: * (A, B) is a loop. So process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again (can happen several times until exit).

So for example, if A is RMI and B is RMI again? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the loop structure for multiple RMI's followed by VF would be something like:

After AE, you have a loop where first you do RMI, then either exit or do another RMI and loop again. But then when you exit, you go to VF. So the loop would be A = RMI, B = RMI? But then how to get to VF.

Alternatively, maybe the loop is RMI followed by a choice between continuing the loop (doing RMI again) or proceeding to VF.

So perhaps the structure is: after AE, you have a loop that consists of RMI followed by a choice between doing RMI again (loop) or going to VF. But how to model that.

Wait, the * operator in process tree is defined as * (A, B), where A is executed first, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

So for example, if A is RMI and B is RMI, then the loop would be: execute RMI, then either exit or execute RMI and then RMI again. So the possible traces would be RMI, RMI, RMI... (any number), then exit. But then after the loop, you need to do VF. So perhaps the structure after AE is: * (RMI, RMI) followed by VF. But wait, no. Because the * (A, B) would mean execute A, then either exit or B and then A again. So if A is RMI, B is RMI, then the loop would be RMI (A), then either exit or RMI (B) followed by A (RMI). So for example, possible traces: RMI (exit), RMI  RMI  RMI (exit), etc. So that would model multiple RMI's. Then after the loop, you do VF. So the sequence would be after AE: * (RMI, RMI) then VF. But the * (RMI, RMI) would generate sequences like RMI, RMI RMI, etc. But then after the loop, you do VF. So the entire sequence after AE would be [RMI*] followed by VF.

But how to model that with the * operator. Let's see.

The * (A, B) operator: A is executed first. Then either exit or B then A again. So for example, if A is RMI, B is RMI, then the loop would be:

- Start with A (RMI)
- Then either exit, or execute B (RMI) then A again (RMI)
So possible traces for the loop part:

- RMI (exit)
- RMI  RMI  RMI (exit)
- RMI  RMI  RMI  RMI  RMI (exit), etc.

Wait, no. Let's break it down.

When you have * (A, B), the execution is:

- Execute A

Then, either:

- Exit the loop, or

- Execute B, then execute the entire * (A, B) again.

Wait, no. Wait the definition says: "the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again (this can happen several times until the loop is exited)."

Wait, so the structure is:

A

then either exit, or B followed by A again.

Wait, but then the entire structure would be A followed by (B followed by A)*.

Wait, for example:

First execute A.

Then, if you don't exit, you execute B, then you have to execute A again. So the loop would be A, (B, A)*.

So for example, the possible traces for the loop part:

- A

- A  B  A

- A  B  A  B  A

etc.

But that's a loop where each iteration after the first is B followed by A.

But in our case, we want multiple RMI's. So maybe A is RMI, and B is RMI. Then the loop would be:

Execute A (RMI), then either exit or execute B (RMI) and then A again (RMI).

So the traces would be:

RMI (exit)

RMI  RMI  RMI (exit)

RMI  RMI  RMI  RMI  RMI (exit), etc.

But that's not exactly right. Because after the first A (RMI), then if you choose not to exit, you do B (RMI), then A again (RMI). So the sequence would be RMI  RMI  RMI.

Wait, yes. So for example, first A (RMI), then B (RMI), then A (RMI again). So the total is three RMI's. So the loop structure would generate sequences of RMI repeated any number of times (1 or more?), but wait the first A is executed, then you can choose to exit (so just RMI), or do B and then A again. So the first A is mandatory. So the minimal is one RMI. But in the process, maybe after AE, you don't have to do RMI at all. So perhaps the RMI is optional.

Wait, in case 2, after AE, they go straight to AD. So RMI is optional. So the structure should allow for zero or more RMI's.

So how to model that.

If the loop allows for zero or more RMI's, then perhaps we need a different structure. Because the * operator as defined starts with A. So if A is RMI, then you have to do at least one RMI. But in case 2, there's no RMI. So that's a problem.

So perhaps we need to have an XOR between doing the loop (which starts with RMI) or proceeding to VF. Wait, but if there's no RMI, then after AE, you go directly to VF.

Wait, but in case 2: after AE, they go to AD. So maybe VF is not done after RMI. Wait, no. Let's check the case 2 sequence:

RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC.

So after AE, they go to AD. So in this case, there was no RMI. So maybe after AE, the process can go directly to AD, or go into the RMI loop.

But in case 1, after AE, they do RMI, then VF, then AD.

Case 3: after AE, RMI, RMI, VF, then AD.

So the VF comes after the RMI steps. So the structure after AE is: either go to AD directly (but wait, no, because after AE in case 2, they go to AD. But in case 1, after AE, they do RMI, VF, then AD. So maybe after AE, there's a choice between proceeding to AD directly or entering the RMI loop.

But in case 2, after AE, they go to AD. So that's possible.

But then, when you enter the loop, you do RMI, then VF, then possibly loop again.

Wait, but in case 3, after RMI, RMI, VF, then AD. So after the VF, they go to AD.

So perhaps the structure is:

After AE, you have a loop that can be entered. The loop consists of RMI and VF. But how?

Wait, perhaps the loop is: after AE, you have a loop where you do RMI followed by VF, and this can happen multiple times. So each iteration of the loop is RMI  VF. Then after the loop, you go to AD.

But in case 2, there's no loop, so after AE, you go directly to AD.

So that would mean that after AE, there's a choice between doing the loop (RMI  VF) zero or more times, then AD. But how to model that with process tree.

Wait, the standard way to model optional loops is to have a loop where the loop body is executed zero or more times. But process tree's * operator is defined as A followed by either exit or B then A again. So to have a loop that can be skipped, you need to have an XOR between proceeding directly or entering the loop.

So for example, after AE, you have an XOR between:

- Proceeding to AD (but wait, in case 2, after AE, they go to AD. But in case 1 and 3, after RMI and VF, they go to AD. So perhaps after the loop, you go to AD.

But let's think.

The process after AE could be:

Either:

- Go directly to AD (if no missing info), or

- Enter a loop where you do RMI followed by VF, and this loop can repeat.

But how to model that.

So the structure would be:

AE  X(AD, * (RMI  VF, ... )) ?

Wait, let's see.

Wait, the * operator is defined as * (A, B), where A is executed first, then either exit or B then A again.

So if we want to model a loop that can be executed zero or more times, perhaps we need to have a choice between doing nothing (proceeding to AD) or entering the loop.

But the loop itself would be something like: RMI  VF  (loop again). But how.

Alternatively, the loop could be defined as * (RMI  VF, RMI  VF), but that's not standard.

Wait, perhaps the loop body is RMI followed by VF. Then the * operator would be * (RMI  VF, RMI  VF). But the definition says * (A, B) where A is executed first, then either exit or B then A again.

So if A is RMI  VF, and B is RMI  VF, then:

Execute A (RMI  VF), then either exit or B (RMI  VF) then A again.

So the possible traces would be:

RMI  VF (exit)

RMI  VF  RMI  VF  RMI  VF (exit), etc.

So that's a loop that executes the body at least once, and then possibly repeats. But if you want to allow zero times, then you need to have an XOR between proceeding directly to AD and the loop.

So after AE, you have an XOR between:

- Directly going to AD (for the case where no RMI is needed), or

- Executing the loop which is RMI  VF followed by the same loop again.

But the loop would be * (RMI  VF, RMI  VF), but that would require at least one execution. So to allow zero times, we need to have a choice between the loop and not.

Wait, but the standard way to model a loop that can be executed zero or more times is to have a loop structure that includes an option to exit immediately. But according to the process tree definition, the * operator starts with A, so you have to execute A first. So for zero times, you need to have a choice between exiting the loop immediately or proceeding.

Wait, maybe the structure is: after AE, there's a choice between:

- Proceeding to AD (so no loop), or

- Executing the loop which consists of RMI  VF and then possibly looping again.

But how to model that.

Perhaps the correct approach is:

After AE, there's a loop that can be entered. The loop body is RMI  VF, and the loop can be repeated. But to allow for zero times, you need to have an XOR between the loop and proceeding to AD.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, * ( RMI  VF, RMI  VF ) )

Wait, but * (A, B) where A is RMI  VF, B is RMI  VF.

But the * operator's definition: execute A, then either exit or B then A again.

So if A is RMI  VF, then the loop would start with A (RMI  VF), then either exit or B (RMI  VF) then A again.

So possible traces for the loop part: RMI  VF (exit), or RMI  VF  RMI  VF  RMI  VF (exit), etc.

So that's at least one iteration of the loop. But in case 2, there's no loop. So after AE, they go directly to AD. So that would mean that the XOR is between AD and the loop.

So the structure after AE is:

X( AD, * ( RMI  VF, RMI  VF ) )

But that would mean that for case 2, we choose AD directly. For case 1 and 3, we choose the loop. But wait, in case 1, after AE, they do RMI  VF  AD. So the loop is executed once (RMI  VF), then exit the loop, then proceed to AD. So yes.

In case 3: RMI  RMI  VF  AD. Wait, no. Case 3's sequence after AE is RMI, RMI, VF, AD. So the loop part would have to be two RMI's followed by VF. But according to the loop structure I described, each iteration is RMI  VF. So two iterations would be RMI  VF  RMI  VF. But in case 3, it's RMI  RMI  VF. So that's different.

Ah, right. So in case 3, after AE, they do two RMI's, then VF. So the VF comes after all RMI's. So perhaps the structure is: after AE, you have a loop where you do RMI multiple times, then VF. So the RMI's can be repeated any number of times (including zero?), then VF. But how to model that.

Wait, if RMI can happen zero or more times, then VF, then proceed to AD.

But the problem is that in case 2, after AE, they go to AD directly. So maybe VF is not part of the loop. Wait, no. In case 2, after AE, they go to AD. So there's no VF after AE. But in case 1 and 3, after AE, they have RMI's followed by VF, then AD.

Wait, but in case 1: after AE, RMI  VF  AD. So after VF comes AD.

In case 2: after AE, AD directly.

So perhaps the VF is only done if there was RMI. So the structure is:

After AE, you can have a loop where you do RMI, and then either loop again or proceed to VF. Then after VF, go to AD.

Wait, let's see.

For example:

After AE, there's a loop that consists of RMI followed by a choice between looping again or proceeding to VF.

So the loop would be: RMI  X( loop, VF )

But how to model that.

Alternatively, the structure could be:

After AE, you have a loop where you can do RMI any number of times, and then do VF. So the sequence is RMI*  VF  AD.

But how to model RMI* (zero or more RMI's) with process tree.

In process tree terms, to model zero or more RMI's, you can have a loop that starts with RMI and allows exit immediately. But the * operator requires that A is executed first. So for example, * (RMI, RMI) would execute RMI first, then either exit or RMI again. So that's at least one RMI. To allow zero, you need to have an XOR between proceeding to VF directly (no RMI) and the loop.

So:

After AE, XOR between:

- Proceed to VF directly (so RMI zero times), or

- Execute a loop of RMI's (at least one) then VF.

But then the structure would be:

AE  X( VF, * (RMI, RMI)  VF )

Wait, but how to combine them.

Alternatively, after AE, there's a sequence of RMI* followed by VF. So:

AE  (RMI)*  VF  AD.

But how to model (RMI)* in process tree.

The standard way to model zero or more RMI's is to have a loop where you can exit immediately. So:

XOR between exiting (so no RMI) or doing RMI and looping again.

But process tree's * operator can't directly model zero times. So to model zero or more, you need to have a loop that starts with a choice.

Wait, perhaps using an XOR between the loop and not. But process tree doesn't have a direct operator for zero or more. Let's think.

The standard way in process trees is to use a loop operator where the loop body is executed zero or more times. But according to the problem statement, the * operator is defined as: A is executed, then either exit or B then A again. So that means that A must be executed at least once. So to model zero or more, you need to have an XOR between the loop (which starts with A) and proceeding directly.

For example, to model zero or more RMI's:

X ( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )

But tau is a silent step. So the XOR between silent (proceeding) and the loop.

But the silent step would mean that you can skip the loop. So:

AE  X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )  VF  AD.

But then, the X (tau, ...) would mean that either you take tau (so do nothing) and proceed, or execute the loop.

But the loop is * (RMI, RMI), which would execute RMI first, then either exit or RMI again.

So for example, if you choose the loop part, then you have to do RMI at least once. So the X (tau, loop) would allow for zero RMI's (by taking tau) or one or more RMI's.

But then after that, you do VF.

So the structure after AE would be:

X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )  VF  AD.

But let's see for case 2: after AE, they go directly to AD. So in this case, after AE, X( tau, ... ) would choose tau, then proceed to VF? But in case 2, after AE, they go to AD directly, not VF. So that's a problem.

Wait, no. In case 2: RA  VF  AE  AD. So after AE, they go to AD. So VF is not done after AE in case 2. So VF is not part of the sequence after AE in that case. But in case 1 and 3, after AE, they have RMI  VF  AD.

So the VF after AE is only done when there's RMI. So the structure after AE is:

Either go directly to AD (case 2), or do RMI's followed by VF then AD.

So the correct structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI*  VF  AD ) )

But how to model that.

So after AE, there's a choice between AD (directly) or the path of RMI's followed by VF then AD.

But RMI* means zero or more RMI's. But if you have RMI* and then VF, then for zero RMI's, you'd have VF  AD. But in case 2, after AE, they go to AD directly, not VF. So that's not correct.

Ah, right. Because in case 2, there's no VF after AE. So the VF is only done when there's RMI. So the correct path is: after AE, if there's RMI, then do RMI multiple times, then VF, then AD. If no RMI, then go directly to AD.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( (RMI*  VF )  AD ) )

But wait, no. Because after RMI* and VF, then AD. But the AD is the same in both paths.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI*  VF  AD ) )

But that would mean that in the loop path, you do RMI* followed by VF then AD. But for the direct path, you go directly to AD.

But in case 2, yes: after AE, choose AD.

In case 1: after AE, choose the loop path. RMI* (which in this case is one RMI), then VF  AD.

In case 3: RMI* (two RMI's), then VF  AD.

Yes. So that would fit.

Now, how to model RMI* in process tree.

RMI* means zero or more RMI's. So to model that, we need a loop that allows for zero or more.

As discussed earlier, the standard way is to have an XOR between proceeding (tau) and the loop. But the loop itself would be * (RMI, RMI) which requires at least one RMI.

So for RMI* (zero or more), we can model it as:

X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )

But then, the X( tau, ... ) would allow choosing to do nothing (tau) or the loop.

But in the context of the process tree, the X (tau, ...) would be part of the structure.

So the structure after AE would be:

AE  X( AD, ( X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )  VF  AD ) )

Wait, but that seems complicated. Let's break it down.

The overall structure after AE is a choice between:

- Directly going to AD (for cases where no RMI is needed), or

- Doing the RMI loop followed by VF and then AD.

But the RMI loop needs to allow zero or more RMI's. However, in the second path, if you have zero RMI's, then you'd do VF and then AD. But in case 2, there's no VF. So if you have the second path, but RMI* zero times, then VF would be executed. But in case 2, after AE, they go directly to AD. So we don't want VF in that case.

So the problem is that the second path (RMI loop followed by VF  AD) would include VF even when RMI is zero times. But in reality, when there's no RMI, we don't do VF. So that's incorrect.

Ah, right. So the VF is only done when there's at least one RMI. So the correct structure is:

After AE, you have a choice between:

- AD (no RMI needed), or

- RMI followed by a loop where you can do more RMI's and then VF, then AD.

Wait, so:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  (X( loop, VF ))  AD ) )

Wait, let's think.

After AE, if you choose the loop path, you first do RMI. Then, you have a choice between doing another RMI (loop) or proceeding to VF. Then after VF, you go to AD.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But how to model the loop.

Let's see:

After AE, you have a choice between AD and another path.

The other path is:

RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

But X( RMI, VF ) means that after the first RMI, you can choose to do another RMI or proceed to VF.

So for example:

- RMI  RMI  RMI  ... (any number of RMI's)  VF  AD.

Yes. Because each time you do RMI, you choose to either do another RMI or VF.

So the X( RMI, VF ) allows for choosing between RMI (looping again) or VF.

So the structure after AE would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

Wait, but let's check.

In this structure, for the loop path:

- Start with RMI.

- Then choose between RMI (loop) or VF.

If you choose VF, then proceed to AD.

So possible traces:

RMI  VF  AD

RMI  RMI  VF  AD

RMI  RMI  RMI  VF  AD

etc.

Which matches case 1 and 3.

Case 1: AE  RMI  VF  AD.

Case 3: AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD.

Case 2: AE  AD directly.

Yes. That seems to fit.

Now, how to model this with process tree operators.

The X( AD, ... ) is the main choice after AE.

The other branch is RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

But X( RMI, VF ) would be an XOR between RMI and VF.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But in process tree terms, how to represent this.

Let's build it step by step.

The root of the tree would be the entire process.

The main sequence is RA  VF  AE  ...  AD  SC  AC.

Wait, let's look at the overall flow.

The full process for all cases starts with RA, then VF, then AE. Then the branching.

After AE, the structure as discussed. Then after AD, SC, then AC.

Wait, looking at the event log:

All cases have RA, VF, AE, then either AD or RMI followed by VF, then AD, SC, AC.

Wait in case 1: after AE, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC.

Case 2: AE  AD  SC  AC.

Case 3: AE  RMI, RMI, VF, AD  SC  AC.

So the overall structure is:

RA  VF  AE  [branching]  AD  SC  AC.

So the branching after AE is as discussed.

So the process tree would have:

- Sequence of RA, VF, AE.

- Then a choice between AD and the RMI path.

- Then AD, SC, AC.

Wait, but after the branch, all paths lead to AD. So perhaps the AD is after the branching.

Wait, no. In the structure I described earlier, after AE, the choice is between AD (directly) or the path that leads to AD via RMI and VF.

So the AD is part of both branches. So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But in reality, the AD is the same activity. So perhaps the correct structure is that after the X, all paths lead to AD. So the AD is after the X.

Wait, for example:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ) ) )  AD  SC  AC.

But that would mean that the AD is after the X, but in the second branch, after X( RMI, VF ), you need to get to AD.

So perhaps the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But then the AD is part of the second branch.

Alternatively, the X has two children: one is AD, and the other is a sequence of RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

But then the AD would be duplicated. But in reality, the AD is a single activity. So perhaps the correct way is that after the X, all paths lead to AD. So the X is before AD.

So:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But that's not possible because AD is part of both branches. So better to have:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ) ) )  AD  SC  AC.

But then the X( AD, ... ) would choose either AD directly or the RMI path. Then after the X, you have AD. But that would mean that in the RMI path, after X( RMI, VF ), you have to go to AD. So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ) ) )  AD  SC  AC.

But that's not correct because in the RMI path, after X( RMI, VF ), you need to do AD. So perhaps the X( AD, ... ) is not correct. Let's think.

The correct structure is:

After AE, you have two possibilities:

1. Go directly to AD.

2. Do RMI (at least once), possibly more, then VF, then AD.

So the AD is the same activity. So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But that's not right because the second branch ends with AD, and the first branch is AD. So the X would have two children: AD and the sequence RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD. But that would duplicate AD. Which is not possible.

Ah, right. So the AD should be after the X. So the X is a choice between proceeding to AD directly or proceeding through the RMI path which leads to AD.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But that's not correct because the X would have two children: AD and the sequence (RMI  ...  AD). But then after the X, the AD would be part of the second branch. So the first branch is just AD, and the second branch is RMI  ...  AD. So the AD activity is part of both branches. But in reality, there's only one AD activity. So the process tree should have a single AD node after the branching.

So perhaps the correct structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But that would create two AD nodes. Which is not correct. So that's a problem.

Alternative approach: the X has two children: one is AD (direct), and the other is a sequence that leads to AD. So the X's children are:

- AD

- (RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD )

But then the second child ends with AD, and the first child is AD. So when building the tree, the AD would be part of both paths. But in reality, after the X, you have a single AD. So perhaps the correct way is to have the X before AD, and the AD is after the X.

Wait, no. Let's model it as:

AE  [X ( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ) ) ) ]  AD  SC  AC.

But that would mean that after the X, you have AD. But the X's children are AD (first child) and the sequence RMI  X( RMI, VF ) (second child). So when the X chooses the first child, you get AD. When it chooses the second child, you get RMI  X( RMI, VF ), and then proceed to AD. So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ) ) )  AD  SC  AC.

But then the AD after X would be the same as the first child. So this would mean that in the first branch, after X, you have AD. In the second branch, after the X (which is the RMI path), you have AD. So the AD is part of the sequence after the X.

Wait, but the X is a node that has two children: AD and the sequence (RMI  X( RMI, VF )). So the AD in the first child is a leaf. The second child is a sequence of RMI  X( RMI, VF ). Then, after the X node, we have AD. So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ) ) )  AD  SC  AC.

But this would mean that the X node has two children: one is AD, and the other is a sequence (RMI followed by X( RMI, VF )). Then after the X node, there's another AD. Which would mean that in the second path, after RMI  X( RMI, VF ), you have AD. So the AD is after the X node.

But then for the first path: AE  AD (from X's first child)  AD (after X)  SC  AC. Which would have two AD's. Which is not correct.

Ah, right. So the AD should be part of the X's children. So the X's children should both lead to AD.

So the correct structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But then the AD is part of both branches. So the X node has two children: one is the AD activity, and the other is a sequence that ends with AD. But then the AD would be duplicated. Which is not possible. Because in reality, there's only one AD activity.

So this suggests that the X should have two children: one that goes to AD directly, and another that goes through RMI and VF to AD. So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But in this case, the AD in the first child is the same as the AD in the second child. So the tree would have two AD nodes. Which is not correct. So we need to have a single AD node after the X.

So perhaps the correct way is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ) ) )  AD  SC  AC.

But this would mean that the X node's children are AD and the sequence RMI  X( RMI, VF ). Then after the X node, you have AD. So in the first path, you have AE  AD (from X's first child)  AD (after X)  SC  AC. Which is two AD's. Not good.

So the problem is that the X node's children should both lead to the same AD. So the AD should be after the X node.

So the X node's children should both end with the path leading to AD.

So the structure should be:

AE  X( [path to AD], [path to AD] )  SC  AC.

So the first path is direct to AD.

The second path is RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

So the X node has two children: one is AD, and the other is (RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD).

But then the AD is part of the second child. So the X node's children are:

- AD (as a leaf)

- a sequence of RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD

But then the second child ends with AD. So the overall structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )  SC  AC.

But then, after the X node, there's SC and AC. But the AD is part of the X's children. So after the X node, you have SC and AC. But the AD should be before SC.

Wait, yes. Because the sequence is AD  SC  AC.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )  SC  AC.

But this would mean that the X node's children are AD and the sequence RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD. Then after X, you have SC and AC.

But then, for the first child (AD), after X, you have SC  AC.

For the second child: RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD  SC  AC.

Yes. So the AD is part of the second child's sequence. And the first child is AD. So when the X chooses the first child, you have AE  AD  SC  AC.

When it chooses the second child, you have AE  RMI  ...  AD  SC  AC.

Yes. So this would be correct.

But the X node's children would be:

- AD (as a leaf)

- a sequence node that has RMI, then X( RMI, VF ), then AD.

So the X node is the parent of both AD and the sequence.

Now, let's model the X( RMI, VF ) part.

The X( RMI, VF ) means that after the first RMI, you can choose to do another RMI or proceed to VF.

So in the process tree, the X operator would have two children: RMI and VF.

So the structure for the loop part is:

After the first RMI (part of the sequence), you have an XOR between RMI and VF.

So the sequence for the second child of the main X is:

Sequence node with:

- RMI

- XOR node with children RMI and VF

- AD

Wait, no. Because after the first RMI, you have X( RMI, VF ). So if you choose RMI, you loop again; if VF, then proceed to AD.

So the structure would be:

Sequence of:

RMI  [X( RMI, VF )]  AD.

So the X node has two children: RMI and VF.

Then, after the X node, you have AD.

So the sequence for the second child of the main X is:

RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

So the X( RMI, VF ) is a node that has two children: RMI and VF. Then, after the X node, you have AD.

Yes.

So putting it all together.

Let's build the process tree.

The overall process is:

RA  VF  AE  [X ( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) ) ]  SC  AC.

So the sequence starts with RA, then VF, then AE.

Then a choice between AD and the RMI path.

Then after that choice, SC and AC.

Wait, no. Because the AD is part of the choice branches. So the structure after AE is:

X ( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

Then after that X node, you have SC and AC.

But SC and AC should come after AD.

So the entire sequence would be:

RA  VF  AE  X ( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )  SC  AC.

But that's not correct. Because the AD must come before SC and AC.

So the X node's children should lead to AD, and then after AD, SC and AC.

So the correct structure is:

RA  VF  AE  X ( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )  SC  AC.

Yes. Because the X node's children both end with AD. So after the X node, you have SC and AC.

But how is the X node structured.

Let's detail the process tree.

Root is a sequence node.

Sequence node children:

- RA (leaf)

- VF (leaf)

- AE (leaf)

- Another sequence node for the rest? Or the X node.

Wait, the sequence after AE is the X node, then SC, then AC.

Wait, no. The X node is part of the sequence. So the main sequence would be:

RA  VF  AE  X ( ... )  SC  AC.

Yes.

So the structure is:

- Root: sequence

  - Child: RA (leaf)

  - Child: VF (leaf)

  - Child: AE (leaf)

  - Child: X node (for the branching after AE)

  - Child: SC (leaf)

  - Child: AC (leaf)

The X node has two children:

- AD (leaf)

- A sequence node which is RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

The sequence node for the second branch has children:

- RMI (leaf)

- X node (RMI, VF)

- AD (leaf)

The X node (RMI, VF) has two children: RMI and VF.

Wait, but the X node (RMI, VF) would have children RMI and VF. So when you choose RMI, you loop again; when VF, you proceed to the next step (AD).

Yes.

Now, let's check the case 3:

RA  VF  AE  choose the second branch (RMI path).

Then RMI (first), then X( RMI, VF ). Choose RMI again (second RMI), then X( RMI, VF ) again? No.

Wait, the structure for the second branch is:

RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

So after the first RMI, you have the X node with RMI and VF. If you choose RMI again, then you go back to the X node. But how?

Wait, the X node is part of the sequence. So after RMI, you have the X node. The X node's children are RMI and VF. So when you take the RMI branch of the X node, you do RMI again, and then proceed to the next step. But what's the next step after the X node?

Wait, no. The X node's children are the possible next steps. So after the X node, there's nothing. Because the X node is part of the sequence.

Wait, let's model the sequence node for the second branch:

Sequence node with children:

- RMI (leaf)

- X node (children: RMI and VF)

- AD (leaf)

So the structure is:

RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

So when you execute RMI, then you have to choose between RMI and VF. If you choose RMI, then you do RMI again, and then proceed to the next step of the sequence. But what's next after the X node? The next step is AD.

So after the X node, regardless of the choice, you go to AD.

So if you choose VF from the X node, then you go to AD. If you choose RMI, then you do RMI, and then what? Because the X node's children are RMI and VF. After choosing RMI, you would have to go back to the X node again? No, because the X node is part of the sequence. So the sequence is:

RMI  X  AD.

So after RMI, you have the X node. The X node has two children. So when you choose RMI, you do RMI again, then what? The next step after the X node is AD. So the structure would be:

After the first RMI, you do X( RMI, VF ), which leads to either:

- RMI (another RMI), then proceed to AD.

- VF, then proceed to AD.

So for example:

Case 3's trace after AE: RMI, RMI, VF, AD.

Wait, no. Let's see:

The sequence is:

RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

So first, RMI.

Then, X node: choose RMI again. Now, after the X node's RMI child, you proceed to the next step, which is AD. But that would be RMI (first), RMI (second), then AD. But in case 3, after two RMI's, they do VF then AD. So this structure would not capture that.

Ah, right. Because in this structure, after choosing RMI in the X node, you immediately go to AD. But in reality, after choosing RMI again, you need to loop back to the X node again.

So the current structure is not correct. Because the X node is only executed once. So after the first RMI, you have the X node. Choosing RMI would do RMI again, then proceed to AD. Which would mean that after two RMI's, you go to AD. But in case 3, after two RMI's, they do VF then AD. So this structure would not capture that.

So the problem is that the X node is part of the sequence, and after choosing RMI, you go to the next step (AD). But you want to loop back to the X node.

So the correct way is to have a loop where after the X node's RMI choice, you go back to the X node again.

But how to model that.

The standard way is to have the X node as part of a loop.

Wait, perhaps the structure for the RMI part should be a loop where you can do RMI multiple times, and then VF.

So the correct structure for the loop is:

X( RMI, VF ) but in a loop.

Wait, the * operator is defined as * (A, B), which executes A, then either exit or B then A again.

So for the loop part, after AE, the path is:

RMI* followed by VF  AD.

But RMI* means zero or more RMI's.

To model RMI*, you can have:

* ( RMI, RMI )

But that requires at least one RMI.

But to allow zero, you need to have an XOR between tau and the loop.

But let's think.

The structure for RMI* is:

X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )

But then, after that, you have VF.

So the sequence after AE would be:

X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )  VF  AD.

But then, the AD is after VF.

But in case 2, after AE, they go directly to AD. So the X( tau, ... ) would choose tau, then VF  AD. But in case 2, there's no VF. So that's a problem.

Ah, right. So if you have X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )  VF  AD, then when you choose tau, you go to VF  AD. But in case 2, after AE, they go directly to AD. So VF should not happen.

So this structure is incorrect.

Alternative idea: the VF should only happen after RMI. So when there's RMI, you do VF. When there's no RMI, you don't do VF.

So the structure should be:

After AE, X( AD, ( RMI*  VF  AD ) )

But RMI* includes zero or more RMI's. So when RMI* is zero, then VF  AD. But in case 2, we don't want VF. So that's not correct.

So the correct structure must be:

After AE, X( AD, ( RMI  RMI*  VF  AD ) )

But how.

Wait, perhaps the loop is RMI followed by a loop that allows more RMI's and then VF.

So:

After AE, X( AD, ( RMI  * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD ) )

But * ( RMI, RMI ) would execute RMI first, then either exit or RMI again.

So for example:

RMI  (RMI)*  VF  AD.

So the * ( RMI, RMI ) would be a loop that can be done multiple times.

But then the structure would be:

RMI  * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD.

But * ( RMI, RMI ) is defined as executing RMI first, then either exit or RMI again.

So the sequence would be RMI (first), then RMI (loop), then VF.

So for example, RMI, RMI, VF.

Which matches case 3.

Case 1: RMI  (exit loop)  VF  AD.

Yes.

So the RMI* (including at least one RMI) followed by VF.

But how to model zero RMI's. In case 2, there's zero RMI's, so we take the direct AD.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD ) )

But * ( RMI, RMI ) would require at least one RMI. So the RMI  * ( RMI, RMI ) is redundant. Because * ( RMI, RMI ) already starts with RMI. So perhaps it's simply * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD.

But * ( RMI, RMI ) would start with RMI, then either exit or RMI again.

So the sequence would be:

RMI (first), then either exit or RMI again.

So for example:

RMI  exit  VF  AD.

RMI  RMI  exit  VF  AD.

RMI  RMI  RMI  exit  VF  AD.

Which matches case 1 (RMI once), case 3 (RMI twice), etc.

Yes.

So the structure after AE is:

X( AD, ( * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD ) )

But * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD.

So the X has two children: AD and the sequence of * ( RMI, RMI ) followed by VF then AD.

Now, let's check case 2: after AE, choose AD.

Case 1: choose the second branch, * ( RMI, RMI ) executes once (RMI), then exit, then VF, then AD.

Case 3: * ( RMI, RMI ) executes RMI, then RMI (loop), then exit, then VF, then AD.

Yes.

Now, the * ( RMI, RMI ) operator: the first argument is RMI, the second is RMI.

So the * (A, B) where A is RMI, B is RMI.

Which means: execute A (RMI), then either exit or B (RMI) then A again.

So for example:

- RMI (exit)

- RMI  RMI  RMI (exit)

- etc.

Yes.

So the structure after AE is:

X( AD, ( * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD ) )

But the * ( RMI, RMI ) is a node that has operator LOOP, with children RMI and RMI.

Wait, no. The * operator in process tree is defined as * (A, B), where A is the first part to execute, then either exit or B then A again.

So for the loop part, the * node has A and B as children.

So for * ( RMI, RMI ), the * node has two children: RMI and RMI.

So the structure for the second branch is:

* ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD.

Which means that the * node's output is followed by VF then AD.

Now, let's build the entire process tree.

The main sequence is:

RA  VF  AE  [X( AD, ( * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD ) ) ]  SC  AC.

Wait, but the VF after the * node is part of the second branch. So the structure would be:

After AE, the X node has two children:

- AD (leaf)

- a sequence node which has * ( RMI, RMI ), then VF, then AD.

Yes.

So the sequence node for the second branch has three children: the * node, VF, AD.

Now, the * node has operator LOOP, and children RMI and RMI.

But let's check the definition of * (A, B): the process tree A is executed, then either exit or B and then A again.

So for * (RMI, RMI), A is RMI, B is RMI.

So the * node's children are A and B.

So the * node has two children: RMI and RMI.

Yes.

Now, let's look at the overall process tree.

The root is a sequence node.

Children of root:

- RA (leaf)

- VF (leaf)

- AE (leaf)

- X node (for the branching)

- SC (leaf)

- AC (leaf)

The X node has two children:

- AD (leaf)

- A sequence node (let's call it S)

The sequence node S has children:

- * node (LOOP operator)

- VF (leaf)

- AD (leaf)

The * node has two children:

- RMI (leaf)

- RMI (leaf)

But wait, the * node's children are A and B. So the * node has two children: A (RMI) and B (RMI).

Yes.

But then, the sequence node S has three children: the * node, VF, AD. So the sequence node S has children in order: * node  VF  AD.

Yes.

Now, let's check the traces.

Case 2: after AE, choose the first child of X node (AD), then SC, AC.

Case 1: after AE, choose S. Execute * node:

- Execute A (RMI), then exit (since no B needed). Then VF, then AD.

So RMI  VF  AD.

Case 3: * node executes A (RMI), then B (RMI), then A again. But according to the * operator definition, after executing A, you either exit or execute B then A again.

So for * (A, B), the steps are:

Start with A.

Then either:

- exit

- or B followed by A again.

So for case 3:

A (RMI)  B (RMI)  A (RMI)  exit.

But wait, that would be RMI  RMI  RMI.

But in case 3, after AE, the sequence is RMI, RMI, VF, AD.

But according to this, after the * node, we have VF and AD.

So the * node would generate RMI  RMI  RMI (but that's three RMI's), but case 3 has two RMI's.

Wait, case 3's trace after AE is:

AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD.

So the * node should generate two RMI's.

Let's see: * (RMI, RMI) starts with A (RMI).

Then either exit or B followed by A again.

So for two RMI's:

A (RMI), then choose to do B (RMI) followed by A again.

Then A again (RMI), then exit.

So the sequence would be RMI  RMI  RMI.

But case 3 has two RMI's. So this would generate three RMI's.

Hmm. That's not matching.

Wait, no. Let's see:

First execution of A (RMI).

Then choose to do B (RMI), then A again.

So the steps:

A  B  A  exit.

So that's three RMI's.

But case 3 has two RMI's. So what's wrong.

Ah, perhaps the * operator's B is not RMI, but something else.

Wait, maybe the * (A, B) should have A as RMI  VF, but no.

Wait, perhaps the loop should be RMI followed by a choice between RMI and VF.

But let's think differently.

Alternative approach: after AE, there's a loop where you can do RMI, and then choose to loop again or proceed to VF.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), ... ) )

But this is getting complicated.

Let's think about the standard way to model a loop with a choice inside.

The correct way to model "do RMI multiple times, then VF" is to have a loop that has RMI as the body, and then after the loop, VF.

But the loop should allow for zero or more RMI's. But how to model zero or more.

The standard way in process trees is to use a loop with an XOR inside.

For example, the loop body is RMI followed by a choice between continuing the loop or proceeding to VF.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), ... ) )

But let's see.

The * operator is * (A, B), where A is the first part, then either exit or B then A again.

So if A is RMI  X( RMI, VF ), and B is RMI  X( RMI, VF ).

But that's not correct.

Alternatively, the loop body is RMI, and after the loop, VF.

But to model the loop as zero or more RMI's, then VF.

But the * operator requires that A is executed first.

So for zero or more RMI's followed by VF, you can model it as:

X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )  VF.

But then, for zero RMI's, you take tau and proceed to VF. But in case 2, we don't want VF.

So that's not good.

Alternative idea: the VF is only done if there's at least one RMI.

So the structure after AE is:

X( AD, ( RMI  * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD ) )

But * ( RMI, RMI ) would execute RMI at least once.

So RMI  * ( RMI, RMI ) would be RMI followed by RMI*.

So for example, RMI followed by RMI  RMI  ... 

But * ( RMI, RMI ) starts with RMI, so RMI  * ( RMI, RMI ) is RMI  RMI  ... 

But in case 3, we have two RMI's, then VF.

So RMI  * ( RMI, RMI ) would be two RMI's (first RMI, then * ( RMI, RMI ) which does one more RMI), so total two RMI's.

Wait, * ( RMI, RMI ) starts with RMI (A), then either exit or B (RMI) then A again.

So for two RMI's:

A (RMI), then choose to do B (RMI) and then A again. But then A again would be RMI, then exit.

So the sequence is RMI  RMI  RMI.

Which is three RMI's.

But case 3 has two RMI's.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the loop is * ( RMI, RMI ), but the B is not RMI but something else.

Wait, perhaps the loop is * ( RMI, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ) ) ), but this is getting too complex.

Maybe a better approach is to model the loop as a sequence where after RMI, you can choose to loop again or proceed to VF.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

But this is the same as earlier.

But in this structure, after the first RMI, you have X( RMI, VF ).

If you choose RMI again, then you do RMI and then proceed to the next step (AD), which would be incorrect.

But if the X( RMI, VF ) is part of a loop, then after choosing RMI, you loop back to the X node.

So the correct way is to have the X node inside a loop.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), ... ) )

But let's think.

The * operator for a loop that can have RMI followed by a choice between RMI and VF.

So the loop body is RMI  X( RMI, VF ).

But the * operator is * (A, B), where A is the body, B is the body.

So * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), RMI  X( RMI, VF ) )

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, the loop body is RMI  X( RMI, VF ), and the * operator is applied to this body.

So the * node has A as the body, B as the body.

So when you execute the * node, you start with A (body), then either exit or B (body) again.

But this would mean that each iteration of the loop is the body.

So for example, the body is RMI  X( RMI, VF ).

So first iteration: RMI  X( RMI, VF ).

If in the X node, you choose VF, then you exit the loop.

If you choose RMI, then you do another iteration of the body.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), RMI  X( RMI, VF ) )  AD )

But this seems messy.

Alternatively, the correct way is to have a loop where the body is RMI followed by a choice between continuing or proceeding to VF.

So:

AE  X( AD, ( * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD ) )

But this is what we had before.

But the problem is with the number of RMI's.

Let's take case 3's trace:

AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD.

In the * ( RMI, RMI ) node:

- First, execute A (RMI).

- Then, choose to execute B (RMI) followed by A again.

- Then execute A again (RMI), then exit.

So the RMI's are three times. But in reality, case 3 has two RMI's.

So this doesn't match.

Ah, perhaps the * operator's B is not RMI, but something else.

Wait, maybe the * (A, B) where A is RMI and B is RMI  X( ... ), but this is getting too complicated.

Alternative idea: the loop should be a sequence where you do RMI and then have a choice between looping or proceeding to VF.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ) )  AD )

But no. Let's see.

The X( RMI, VF ) node is part of the sequence.

So the sequence after AE is:

RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

In this structure:

- First RMI.

- Then X( RMI, VF ): if choose RMI, then do RMI again, then proceed to AD.

If choose VF, then proceed to AD.

So for case 3: RMI (first), choose RMI again (second RMI), then proceed to AD. But that would mean after two RMI's, they go to AD directly, without VF. But in case 3, after two RMI's, they do VF then AD.

So this structure is incorrect.

Ah, right. Because in case 3, after two RMI's, they do VF before AD.

So the correct structure should be that after the RMI's, you do VF.

So the structure should be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI*  VF  AD ) )

But RMI* means zero or more RMI's.

But how to model RMI*.

In process trees, to model zero or more RMI's, you can use:

X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )

But then followed by VF.

But then for zero RMI's, you have tau  VF  AD. But in case 2, we don't want VF.

So that's not good.

So the only way is that the VF is only done if there's at least one RMI.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  (RMI)*  VF  AD ) )

Where (RMI)* is zero or more RMI's.

But how to model (RMI)*.

(RMI)* is X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )  VF  AD ) )

But this is getting very complicated.

Let's break it down.

The second branch after AE is:

RMI  [zero or more RMI's]  VF  AD.

So RMI followed by (RMI)*.

Which is RMI  (X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) ))  VF  AD.

But the X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) ) would allow for zero or more additional RMI's.

But let's see for case 1:

RMI (first), then X( tau, ... ) chooses tau, so no more RMI's. Then VF  AD. Correct.

Case 3: RMI (first), then X( tau, ... ) chooses the * ( RMI, RMI ) part. Which would execute RMI (A), then either exit or RMI again (B then A).

So for one additional RMI:

A (RMI), then exit. So total RMI's: first RMI + one more = two. Then VF  AD. Correct.

So yes.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( tau, * ( RMI, RMI ) )  VF  AD ) )

But this seems complex.

Now, let's build the process tree.

The root is a sequence node with children:

- RA

- VF

- AE

- X node (for the branching)

- SC

- AC

The X node has two children:

- AD (leaf)

- A sequence node S

Sequence node S has children:

- RMI (leaf)

- X node (tau and * node)

- VF (leaf)

- AD (leaf)

The X node for the tau and * has children:

- tau (silent step)

- * node (LOOP operator)

The * node has children:

- RMI (leaf)

- RMI (leaf)

But this is getting very nested.

Alternatively, the X node for the tau and * is part of the sequence.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Another approach: the loop for RMI's can be modeled using a * operator where A is RMI and B is RMI, but then after the loop, VF.

But for the zero RMI's case, we have the direct AD.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD ) )

But * ( RMI, RMI ) requires at least one RMI.

So for case 3: * ( RMI, RMI ) generates two RMI's? Let's see.

* ( RMI, RMI ) starts with A (RMI).

Then either exit or B (RMI) followed by A again.

So to get two RMI's:

- A (RMI), then choose B (RMI) followed by A again.

But A again would be RMI, then exit.

So sequence: RMI (A)  RMI (B)  RMI (A)  exit.

That's three RMI's.

But case 3 has two RMI's.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the * operator's B is not RMI but something else.

Wait, maybe the loop should be * ( RMI, (RMI) ), but the B is not RMI but a choice.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a standard way to model a loop with multiple repetitions of RMI followed by VF.

The correct way is to have a loop where you can do RMI any number of times (including zero), but VF is only done if there's at least one RMI.

But in the event log, when there's RMI, VF is always done after.

So the structure should be:

After AE, either go to AD directly, or do RMI multiple times (at least one), then VF, then AD.

So the process tree would have:

AE  X( AD, ( (RMI)+  VF  AD ) )

Where (RMI)+ means one or more RMI's.

To model (RMI)+, you can use * ( RMI, RMI ), which gives at least one.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( * ( RMI, RMI )  VF  AD ) )

Yes.

Now, for case 3: two RMI's.

* ( RMI, RMI ) would generate:

A (RMI), then B (RMI) followed by A again.

So A (RMI), B (RMI), then A again (RMI), then exit.

But that's three RMI's.

But in case 3, there are two RMI's.

Ah, so the problem is that the * ( RMI, RMI ) generates at least one, and for each additional, it's another RMI.

So for two RMI's: A (RMI), then exit.

Because the * (A, B) starts with A. So the minimal is one RMI.

If you exit immediately after A, you have one RMI.

If you choose B (RMI) followed by A again, then you have RMI, RMI, RMI.

But case 3 has two RMI's.

So how to get two RMI's.

Ah, maybe the B is not RMI, but a sequence that includes RMI.

Wait, perhaps the * operator is * ( RMI, RMI  RMI ), but that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the B is a sequence that does RMI, but that's not helpful.

Another idea: the * operator is * ( RMI, RMI ), but the exit after first RMI gives one RMI, exit after B gives two RMI's.

Wait, let's see:

* (A, B) where A is RMI, B is RMI.

Execution:

1. Execute A (RMI)

2. Either exit or execute B then A again.

So for two RMI's:

- A (RMI), then choose to execute B (RMI) and then A again. But then A again would be RMI, so that's three RMI's.

Wait, no. Because B is RMI, then A again.

So steps:

- A (RMI)

- B (RMI)

- A again (RMI)

So that's three RMI's.

So to get two RMI's, you need to exit after the first B.

But the * operator's definition says: after executing A, you either exit or execute B then A again.

So for two RMI's:

- A (RMI), then choose to execute B (RMI), then exit.

But according to the definition, after executing B, you have to execute A again. So you can't exit after B.

The definition says: "either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again".

So after executing A, you can exit, or execute B followed by A again.

So if you choose to execute B and then A again, you have to do A again.

So the minimal sequence after A is A  B  A.

So for two RMI's, you can't do it. Because you have to do at least A  B  A, which is three.

This suggests that the * operator as defined cannot model exactly two RMI's. But in the event log, case 3 has two RMI's.

So this suggests that the * operator model may not be sufficient, or perhaps my understanding is wrong.

Wait, but maybe the * (A, B) where A is RMI and B is RMI, and the loop can exit after executing B.

But according to the problem statement: "the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again (this can happen several times until the loop is exited)."

So after executing A, you can exit, or execute B and then A again.

So for example:

- A  exit

- A  B  A  exit

- A  B  A  B  A  exit

So the number of RMI's is 1, 3, 5, etc. Odd numbers.

But case 3 has two RMI's. Which is even. So this doesn't fit.

Ah, so this suggests that the * operator as defined is not suitable for modeling even numbers of repetitions. Which means that the way I'm modeling it is incorrect.

Alternative approach: the loop should be modeled as RMI followed by a loop where you can choose to do RMI again or proceed to VF.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD ) )

In this structure:

- After AE, choose between AD and the second branch.

- Second branch: RMI  X( RMI, VF )  AD.

Now, the X( RMI, VF ) node has two children: RMI and VF.

So for case 3:

- RMI (first)

- Then choose RMI (second)

- Then proceed to AD. But wait, after X( RMI, VF ), you have AD. So after choosing RMI in the X node, you do RMI and then proceed to AD. But in case 3, after two RMI's, they do VF before AD.

So this structure doesn't capture that.

But if the X( RMI, VF ) node's RMI child leads back to the X node, then:

But how? Because the X node is part of the sequence. So after choosing RMI, you go to the next step, which is AD. So no.

Unless the X node is part of a loop.

Ah! Here's the idea: the X( RMI, VF ) is part of a loop.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, ( * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), ... )  AD ) )

But this is getting too vague.

Let's think of the loop as:

You can do RMI any number of times (including zero), but if you do at least one RMI, then you must do VF before AD.

But how to model this.

The standard way in process trees for this is to have a loop where the body is RMI followed by a choice between continuing or proceeding to VF.

So:

AE  X( AD, * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), ... ) )

But the * operator needs to have A and B.

Let's define A as RMI  X( RMI, VF ), and B as RMI  X( RMI, VF ).

So * (A, B).

Then, the loop would start with A.

A is RMI  X( RMI, VF ).

So when you execute A, you do RMI, then X( RMI, VF ).

In the X node, if you choose RMI, then you do RMI again and then the X node again.

If you choose VF, then you proceed to AD.

So the structure would be:

AE  X( AD, * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), RMI  X( RMI, VF ) )  AD )

But this is complex.

Let's break it down.

The * node has operator LOOP, with children A and B, where A and B are both RMI  X( RMI, VF ).

So for the loop body, you have RMI  X( RMI, VF ).

So when you start the loop, you execute A (RMI  X( RMI, VF )).

In the X node, you can choose RMI or VF.

If you choose VF, then you exit the loop.

If you choose RMI, then you execute B (which is RMI  X( RMI, VF )) again.

So for example:

- First, A: RMI  X( RMI, VF )

- In X node, choose VF  exit loop. So the trace is RMI  VF.

- If in X node choose RMI, then execute B: RMI  X( RMI, VF )

- Then in X node, choose VF  exit. So trace: RMI  RMI  VF.

- If in X node choose RMI again, then execute B, etc.

Yes! This matches the event log.

Case 1: RMI  VF  AD.

Case 3: RMI  RMI  VF  AD.

Yes.

So the structure after AE is:

X( AD, * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), RMI  X( RMI, VF ) )  AD )

But wait, the * node's children are A and B. A and B are both RMI  X( RMI, VF ).

But the * operator is * (A, B), where A is the first part to execute, then either exit or B then A again.

So the execution of * (A, B) would be:

Execute A.

Then either exit or execute B then A again.

So in this case:

A is RMI  X( RMI, VF )

B is RMI  X( RMI, VF )

So:

- Execute A: RMI  X( RMI, VF )

- In X node, choose VF  exit. So trace: RMI  VF.

- Or in X node choose RMI, then execute B (RMI  X( RMI, VF )), then A again.

But A is RMI  X( RMI, VF ), so after B, you execute A.

So the trace would be: RMI (A)  RMI (B's RMI)  X( RMI, VF )  RMI (A's RMI)  X( RMI, VF )  etc.

But this would generate more RMI's.

But in reality, for case 3: RMI  RMI  VF  AD.

Let's see:

- Execute A: RMI  X( RMI, VF )

- In X node, choose RMI  then execute B (RMI  X( RMI, VF ))

- In B's X node, choose VF  exit.

So the trace is RMI  RMI  VF.

Yes! Exactly.

Because:

- A: RMI  X( RMI, VF )

- In X node, choose RMI.

- Then B is executed: RMI  X( RMI, VF )

- In B's X node, choose VF.

So the sequence is RMI (from A), RMI (from B), VF (from B's X node).

Yes. So two RMI's followed by VF.

Perfect.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), RMI  X( RMI, VF ) )  AD )

But wait, the * node has children A and B. But A and B are the same.

But in the process tree, the * node would have two children: the RMI  X( RMI, VF ) sequence for A and B.

So the * node has operator LOOP, and two children: the sequence node for A and the sequence node for B.

But since A and B are the same, both are sequences of RMI followed by X( RMI, VF ).

But in reality, for the * operator, the first child is A, the second is B.

But when you execute B, you then execute A again.

So the structure is correct.

Now, let's build this process tree.

The root is a sequence node.

Children of root:

- RA

- VF

- AE

- X node (for the branching)

- SC

- AC

The X node (let's call it X1) has two children:

- AD (leaf)

- Another sequence node S

Sequence node S has children:

- * node (LOOP operator)

- AD (leaf)

The * node has two children:

- A sequence node S1

- A sequence node S2

Both S1 and S2 are sequences of RMI followed by X node (RMI, VF).

So S1 has children:

- RMI (leaf)

- X node X2 (children: RMI and VF)

Similarly for S2.

But wait, the * node's children are A and B. A is S1, B is S2.

But since S1 and S2 are the same, it's okay.

Now, let's check the structure.

For the trace in case 3:

- After AE, choose the second branch (S).

- S is * node followed by AD.

- * node executes A (S1).

S1: RMI  X2.

X2 has two children: RMI and VF.

In X2, choose RMI.

Then B (S2) is executed.

S2: RMI  X2.

In X2, choose VF.

So the sequence is RMI (from S1), RMI (from S2), VF.

Then proceed to AD.

Yes.

So the final process tree structure would be:

- Root: sequence

  - RA

  - VF

  - AE

  - X node (X1)

    - AD

    - Sequence node S

      - * node (LOOP)

        - S1: sequence (RMI  X2)

        - S2: sequence (RMI  X2)

      - AD

  - SC

  - AC

Wait, but the sequence node S has * node and then AD.

Yes.

But in the * node, the two children are S1 and S2, which are both sequences of RMI followed by X2.

X2 is an XOR node with children RMI and VF.

So X2 has operator XOR, children RMI and VF.

Now, let's check the case where there's one RMI.

Case 1: after AE, choose S.

* node executes A (S1).

S1: RMI  X2.

In X2, choose VF.

So sequence RMI  VF.

Then proceed to AD.

Yes.

Case 2: after AE, choose AD directly.

Yes.

Another case: three RMI's.

But the event log doesn't have that, but theoretically possible.

Now, this structure seems to fit.

Now, let's build the process tree in terms of the operators.

The root is a sequence.

Children of root:

- RA (leaf)

- VF (leaf)

- AE (leaf)

- X1 (XOR node)

  - Child: AD (leaf)

  - Child: S (sequence node)

    - Child: * node (LOOP)

      - Child: S1 (sequence node)

        - Child: RMI (leaf)

        - Child: X2 (XOR node)

          - Child: RMI (leaf)

          - Child: VF (leaf)

      - Child: S2 (sequence node)

        - Child: RMI (leaf)

        - Child: X2 (XOR node)

          - Child: RMI (leaf)

          - Child: VF (leaf)

    - Child: AD (leaf)

- SC (leaf)

- AC (leaf)

But wait, the * node's children are S1 and S2.

But S1 and S2 are both sequences of RMI  X2.

But in the process tree, the * node's children are the two sequences.

Yes.

But in reality, the * operator's A is S1, B is S2.

When you execute A, you do S1.

Then either exit or execute B then A again.

So when you choose to execute B, then A again.

Yes.

This seems correct.

Now, to represent this as a process tree.

But the problem is that the X2 node is duplicated for S1 and S2.

But in reality, the X2 node can be shared, but in process tree construction, each node is separate.

But for the purpose of the final answer, we just need to describe the structure.

So the final process tree structure would be:

- Sequence

  - RA

  - VF

  - AE

  - XOR

    - AD

    - Sequence

      - LOOP

        - Sequence

          - RMI

          - XOR

            - RMI

            - VF

        - Sequence

          - RMI

          - XOR

            - RMI

            - VF

      - AD

  - SC

  - AC

But this seems a bit redundant. Because the two sequences under the LOOP are identical. But in process tree terms, they are separate nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps the LOOP operator's A and B can be the same sequence node.

Yes.

But for simplicity, the process tree structure would be:

Root: Sequence

Children:

- RA

- VF

- AE

- XOR node (X1)

  - AD

  - Sequence node (S)

    - LOOP node (operator LOOP)

      - Child: Sequence node (S1) with children RMI and XOR node (X2) with children RMI and VF

      - Child: same as S1 (another sequence node with RMI and X2)

    - AD

- SC

- AC

But in reality, the X2 node can be the same, but in process tree, each node has its own parent.

But for the final answer, we need to describe the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the LOOP node's A is the sequence RMI  X(RMI, VF), and B is also the same sequence.

So the structure is:

AE  X( AD, * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), RMI  X( RMI, VF ) )  AD )

But in the tree, the LOOP node has two children, each being a sequence of RMI followed by XOR (RMI, VF).

Yes.

Now, the SC and AC are after the entire branching.

So after the X1 node, which includes the AD and the loop path, we have SC and AC.

Yes.

So the entire process tree can be written as:

Sequence(
  RA,
  VF,
  AE,
  XOR(
    AD,
    Sequence(
      LOOP(
        Sequence(RMI, XOR(RMI, VF)),
        Sequence(RMI, XOR(RMI, VF))
      ),
      AD
    )
  ),
  SC,
  AC
)

But in process tree notation, using the operators.

But the problem says to produce the final structure, not code.

So in text form, perhaps like:

Sequence(
  'RA',
  'VF',
  'AE',
  XOR(
    'AD',
    Sequence(
      LOOP(
        Sequence('RMI', XOR('RMI', 'VF')),
        Sequence('RMI', XOR('RMI', 'VF'))
      ),
      'AD'
    )
  ),
  'SC',
  'AC'
)

But this might not be correct. Because the LOOP node's children are the two sequences, but the LOOP operator's definition requires that the first child is A, and the second is B.

But in the structure, the LOOP node has two children, which are the sequences.

Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the LOOP node is defined as * (A, B), so the tree would be:

* ( Sequence(RMI, XOR(RMI, VF)), Sequence(RMI, XOR(RMI, VF)) )

But in the process tree, the operator for LOOP is *.

But the exact way to write it depends on the notation.

But the problem says to produce the final structure.

Another way to think: the correct structure is to have a loop that consists of RMI followed by a choice between RMI and VF.

So the loop body is RMI  X( RMI, VF ), and the loop can be repeated.

So the * (A, B) where A is the body and B is the body.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

In some process tree notations, the loop can be represented as * (A), but according to the problem statement, the * operator is defined as * (A, B), where A is executed first, then either exit or B then A again.

So for a simple loop where you can do A multiple times, you'd have * (A, A).

So for example, * ( RMI, RMI ) would allow multiple RMI's.

But earlier we saw that this doesn't work for even numbers, but maybe the problem's example can be modeled that way.

But in our case, the loop is not just RMI's, but RMI followed by a choice.

So the correct structure is:

AE  X( AD, * ( RMI  X( RMI, VF ), RMI  X( RMI, VF ) )  AD )

But perhaps in the process tree, the X( RMI, VF ) is part of the loop body.

So the correct way is to have:

- After AE, there's an XOR between AD and a loop.

The loop body is RMI  X( RMI, VF ).

The loop is * ( body, body ).

So the process tree would be:

Sequence(
  'RA',
  'VF',
  'AE',
  XOR(
    'AD',
    Sequence(
      LOOP(
        Sequence('RMI', XOR('RMI', 'VF')),
        Sequence('RMI', XOR('RMI', 'VF'))
      ),
      'AD'
    )
  ),
  'SC',
  'AC'
)

Yes.

This seems to fit all cases.

Let's verify case 3:

- After AE, choose the second branch (the loop path).

- The loop executes body (RMI  X(RMI, VF)).

- In X(RMI, VF), choose RMI.

- Then execute body again.

- In the second body's X node, choose VF.

- Then proceed to AD.

So the sequence is RMI  RMI  VF  AD.

Yes.

Case 1:

- After AE, choose loop path.

- Body executes RMI  X(RMI, VF), choose VF.

- So RMI  VF  AD.

Yes.

Case 2: choose AD directly.

Yes.

So this structure seems correct.

Now, the sequence of activities after AE is:

XOR between AD and the loop path which leads to AD.

But the loop path includes the RMI's and VF before AD.

Yes.

Now, the SC and AC are after the AD.

So the entire process tree is:

- RA  VF  AE  [XOR between direct AD and loop path to AD]  SC  AC.

Yes.

So the final process tree structure in the required format.

But to write it in the notation similar to the example.

The example was: + ( 'A', -> ( 'B', 'C' ) )

So using the operators.

So for this case:

Sequence of RA, VF, AE, then XOR with AD and the loop path, then SC and AC.

Let's build it step by step.

First, the root is a sequence node.

The children of the root are RA, VF, AE, then the XOR node, then SC, AC.

The XOR node has two children: AD and a sequence node.

The sequence node has the loop node and then AD.

The loop node has two children: the loop body and the loop body.

Each loop body is a sequence of RMI and XOR(RMI, VF).

So the entire tree can be written as:

-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', X( 'AD', -> ( * ( -> ( 'RMI', X( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), -> ( 'RMI', X( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ) ), 'AD' ) ), 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) )

Wait, but the sequence operator is ->.

So the root is a sequence of multiple children.

So the structure would be:

-> ( RA, VF, AE, X( AD, -> ( * ( -> ( RMI, X( RMI, VF ) ), -> ( RMI, X( RMI, VF ) ) ), AD ), SC, AC )

But in the example, the -> operator takes two arguments.

But in reality, the sequence operator can take multiple children. But according to the problem statement, the -> operator is defined as -> (A, B), meaning A before B.

So to have multiple activities in sequence, you nest them.

For example, -> (A, -> (B, C)) for ABC.

So the root sequence would be:

-> ( RA, -> ( VF, -> ( AE, X( AD, -> ( * ( -> ( RMI, X( RMI, VF ) ), -> ( RMI, X( RMI, VF ) ) ), AD ), -> ( SC, AC ) ) ) ) )

But let's see.

First, the sequence of RA, VF, AE.

So -> (RA, -> (VF, AE)).

Then, after AE, we have the XOR node.

The XOR node has two children: AD and a sequence node.

The sequence node is the loop followed by AD.

The loop is * ( body1, body2 ), where body1 and body2 are -> (RMI, X(RMI, VF)).

Then, after the loop, AD.

So the sequence for the second branch is -> ( * ( body1, body2 ), AD )

So the XOR node has children AD and -> ( * ( body1, body2 ), AD )

Then, after the XOR node, we have SC and AC.

So the overall sequence after AE is:

X( AD, -> ( * ( body1, body2 ), AD ) )  SC  AC.

So the full tree:

-> ( RA, -> ( VF, -> ( AE, X( AD, -> ( * ( -> ( RMI, X( RMI, VF ) ), -> ( RMI, X( RMI, VF ) ) ), AD ), -> ( SC, AC ) ) ) ) )

Yes.

Let's break it down:

- The root is a sequence:

  - RA

  - a sequence of VF and the rest.

    - VF

    - a sequence of AE and the rest.

      - AE

      - X( AD, -> ( * ( body1, body2 ), AD ) )

      - a sequence of SC and AC.

Yes.

So writing it out:

-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', X( 'AD', -> ( * ( -> ( 'RMI', X( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), -> ( 'RMI', X( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ) ), 'AD' ), -> ( 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) ) )

But the X operator in the problem statement is X ( A, B ).

Yes.

So the final process tree is:

-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', X( 'AD', -> ( * ( -> ( 'RMI', X( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), -> ( 'RMI', X( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ) ), 'AD' ), -> ( 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) ) )

But let's check.

The -> ( SC, AC ) is part of the sequence after the XOR node.

Yes.

Now, let's check if this matches the event log.

Case 1:

RA  VF  AE  choose AD directly  SC  AC. But according to this tree, after AE, the XOR node has two children: AD and the loop path. So choosing AD would go to AD, then SC and AC.

Yes.

But in case 1, after AE, they do RMI  VF  AD.

So the path is AE  loop path  AD  SC  AC.

Yes.

The loop path is * ( body1, body2 )  AD.

body1 is RMI  X(RMI, VF).

In body1, choose VF, so RMI  VF.

Then the loop executes body1 (RMI  VF), then the loop's next step is body2.

But the loop is * ( body1, body2 ), which means execute body1, then either exit or execute body2 then body1 again.

So in this case, execute body1 (RMI  VF), then exit. So the loop part is RMI  VF.

Then proceed to AD.

Yes.

Case 3: AE  loop path.

Execute body1: RMI  X(RMI, VF).

In X, choose RMI.

Then execute body2: RMI  X(RMI, VF).

In X, choose VF.

So RMI  RMI  VF.

Then proceed to AD.

Yes.

Perfect.

Now, the X( 'AD', ... ) has two children: 'AD' and the sequence of loop  AD.

But the 'AD' child is the direct path.

Yes.

So this seems correct.

Now, the problem says to produce the final structure.

So the answer should be this process tree in the specified notation.

So the final answer is:

-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', X( 'AD', -> ( * ( -> ( 'RMI', X( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), -> ( 'RMI', X( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ) ), 'AD' ), -> ( 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) ) )

But let's check the structure.

Another way to write it:

The root is a sequence of RA, VF, AE, then a choice between AD and the loop path, then SC and AC.

Yes.

So in the tree:

- The root is a sequence node.

  - Child 1: RA

  - Child 2: sequence node of VF and the rest.

    - Child of that: VF

    - Child: sequence node of AE and the rest.

      - Child: AE

      - Child: X node (AD and the loop path)

        - Child 1: AD

        - Child 2: sequence node of loop and AD

          - Child 1: * node with two children: each is sequence of RMI and X(RMI, VF)

          - Child 2: AD

      - Child: sequence node of SC and AC.

Yes.

So the final process tree in the required format.
