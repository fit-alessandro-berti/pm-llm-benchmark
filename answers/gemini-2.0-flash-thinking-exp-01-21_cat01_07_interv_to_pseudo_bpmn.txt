5. **[Exclusive Gateway: Invoice Matches PO (Purchasing View)?]**
   - **Description:** Decision point based on Purchasing's review if the invoice matches the PO details.
   - **Type:** Exclusive (XOR) Gateway

   - **Path 5a (No Match - Discrepancy): Clarify Discrepancy with Purchasing/Supplier**
     - **Description:** If discrepancies are found (e.g., incorrect pricing, extra units), actions are taken to clarify. This may involve contacting the Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen), or directly contacting the supplier, or asking Accounts Payable (Mary) to hold the invoice.  Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) emails Purchasing team to clarify.  Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) may be looped in to resolve supplier-related issues.
     - **Roles:** Purchasing Officer (Dan), Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
     - **Input:** Invoice, PO, Discrepancy details
     - **Output:** Clarification sought from supplier/internal teams, potentially corrected invoice.
     - **Possible Sequence Flow to:**  [Sub-Process: Resolve Invoice Discrepancy] (See details below) OR direct loop back to 4. Purchasing Reviews Invoice & PO (after clarification/correction).  *Note: Flow after clarification is not fully clear from transcripts, assuming loop back for re-review.*

   - **Path 5b (Match): Send Invoice to Manager for Approval**
     - **Description:** If the invoice matches the PO according to Purchasing, it is forwarded to the Department Manager for final approval. System sends automatic email notification.

   - **Output:** Manager Approval/Rejection decision in system.

7. **[Exclusive Gateway: Manager Approval?]**
   - **Description:** Decision point based on the Department Manager's approval decision.
   - **Type:** Exclusive (XOR) Gateway

   - **Path 7a (No Approval - Rejection/Hold): Investigate Invoice (by AP or Supervisor)**
     - **Description:** If the manager rejects or puts the invoice on hold (e.g., suspicious amount, unexpected items), Accounts Payable (potentially escalated to Supervisor Rita) investigates further. Manager (Carlos) may ask Mary to hold and investigate.
     - **Roles:** Department Manager (Carlos), Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
     - **Input:** Invoice, Manager Rejection Reason
     - **Output:** Investigation actions, potentially resolution or further escalation.
     - **Possible Sequence Flow to:** [Sub-Process: Resolve Invoice Discrepancy] or loop back to 6. Manager Approves Invoice after investigation/correction.  *Note: Flow after investigation is not fully clear from transcripts.*

   - **Path 7b (Approval): Schedule Payment**
     - **Description:** If the manager approves the invoice, Accounts Payable schedules it for payment in the next payment cycle.
     - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
     - **Input:** Approved Invoice
     - **Output:** Invoice scheduled for payment
     - **Sequence Flow to:** [End Event: Invoice Payment Scheduled]

**Sub-Process: Resolve Invoice Discrepancy** (Triggered from Path 5a or 7a)

1. **Exception Handling & Investigation**
   - **Description:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) gets involved when discrepancies or issues cannot be easily resolved by Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) or Purchasing (Dan). This might involve contacting suppliers, coordinating between departments, or handling invoices without POs (e.g., for informally contracted services).
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
   - **Input:** Problematic Invoice (discrepancy, missing info, no PO)
   - **Output:** Resolution plan, communication with stakeholders.

2. **[Exclusive Gateway: Discrepancy Resolvable?]**
   - **Description:** Decision point whether the discrepancy can be resolved through investigation, supplier contact, or internal actions (e.g., retrospective PO creation).
   - **Type:** Exclusive (XOR) Gateway

   - **Path 2a (Resolvable): Correct Invoice/Create Retrospective PO**
     - **Description:** Actions taken to resolve the issue. For invoices without POs, a retrospective PO might be created with department head involvement.  Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) helps resolve pricing discrepancies or missing PO issues with suppliers.
     - **Roles:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), Department Heads (for retro PO), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen), Purchasing Officer (Dan)
     - **Input:** Discrepancy details, supplier/internal communication
     - **Output:** Corrected invoice, Retrospective PO (if needed), Resolved discrepancy.
     - **Sequence Flow to:**  *Ambiguous from transcripts.*  Assumed to return to a point where the corrected invoice can re-enter the normal flow, likely back to 4. Purchasing Reviews Invoice & PO or potentially directly to 6. Manager Approves Invoice depending on the nature of the correction.  *Need clarification on exact re-entry point.*

   - **Path 2b (Unresolvable - Reject Invoice - Implied, not explicitly stated):**
     - **Description:** If the discrepancy cannot be resolved, the invoice might be rejected.  *This is implied as an outcome if resolution fails, though not explicitly mentioned in transcripts.*
     - **Role:**  Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), potentially Department Head (for rejection decision).
     - **Input:** Unresolvable discrepancy
     - **Output:** Invoice Rejection.
     - **Sequence Flow to:** [End Event: Invoice Rejected] *Implied End Event.*


**End Events:**

- **[End Event: Invoice Returned to Supplier]** (Reached from Path 2a)
- **[End Event: Invoice Payment Scheduled]** (Reached from Path 7b)
- **[End Event: Invoice Rejected]** (Implied, potentially reached from Sub-Process Path 2b)


**Artifacts/Data Objects:**

- **Invoice:** Document received from supplier.
- **Purchase Order (PO):** Internal document detailing ordered goods/services.
- **Confirmation (Purchasing):** Communication from Purchasing confirming receipt and PO alignment.
- **Approval (Manager):** Manager's sign-off in the system.

**Roles/Participants:**

- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- Purchasing Officer (Dan)
- Department Manager (Carlos)
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
- Supplier
- Accounting System

**Exceptions/Variations Highlighted:**

- **Invoice without PO Number:** Handled by returning to supplier initially.
- **Invoice Discrepancies (Pricing, Quantities):**  Triggers clarification with Purchasing/Supplier, potential escalation to Supervisor.
- **Invoices for Informally Contracted Services (No PO):** Requires retrospective PO creation, handled by Supervisor and department heads.
- **Manager Rejection/Hold:** Triggers further investigation, potentially by Supervisor.
- **Unresolvable Discrepancies:** May lead to invoice rejection (implied).

**Ambiguities and Points for Further Clarification:**

- **Exact re-entry point into the main flow after resolving a discrepancy** in the sub-process. Does it always go back to Purchasing Review, or sometimes directly to Manager Approval?
- **Specific steps for creating a retrospective PO** and who is ultimately responsible/approves it.
- **Explicit process for invoice rejection** and notification to supplier and internal parties if discrepancies are unresolvable.
- **Detailed flow within "Clarify Discrepancy with Purchasing/Supplier" task.** What are the specific communication methods and steps?
- **Handling of different types of discrepancies.** Are there different resolution paths for pricing vs. quantity discrepancies?

This textual model provides a structured overview of the invoice approval process based on the interviews. It highlights the activities, sequence, decision points, roles, and exceptions.  It also points out areas where the transcripts are ambiguous and further clarification would be needed for a complete and precise process model.  This format should be readily understandable and convertible into a visual BPMN diagram.
