1. Repeated Declaration Submissions: The performance issues occur frequently when declarations are repeatedly submitted after being rejected by various approvers. This could be due to a lack of clear guidelines or feedback about why each declaration was rejected in the first place. By reducing the number of resubmissions, efficiency can be improved.

2. Inadequate Performance at Each Approval Stage: Some approvers consistently reject declarations without providing sufficient reason (like SUPERVISOR and EMPLOYEE in certain sequences) leading to repeated submissions and delay in processing payments. This could indicate a need for training or clarification on the approval criteria, improving decision-making speed, or enhancing communication within the approval process.

3. Rejection by ADMINISTRATION and PRE_APPROVER: There is also a significant performance issue when declarations are rejected at these stages, as it can lead to a lengthy reapproval process (as seen in sequences with multiple rejections). This could be due to strict policies or misunderstandings about what constitutes an acceptable declaration. Reviewing and adjusting these policies might help streamline the process.

4. Incomplete Declarations: The MISSING status indicates that some declarations are not fully complete before final approval, which can cause delays in payment processing. This could be due to a lack of clarity about what constitutes a complete declaration or insufficient guidance for employees during the submission process.

5. Inefficient Budget Management: Rejections by BUDGET OWNER are also frequent and can lead to performance issues, especially when budget constraints are causing delays in approval. This could indicate a need for better budget management tools, more accurate budget forecasting, or more frequent reviews of budget allocations to ensure sufficient funds for approved declarations.

6. Lack of Communication: The lack of clear communication between the various approvers and the employee can lead to confusion and delays in the process. Providing regular updates on the status of each declaration, clarifying any concerns or rejections, and ensuring all stakeholders have access to the necessary information could help streamline the approval process.

Overall, improving clarity in guidelines, providing better communication, training approvers on their roles and responsibilities, revising policies as needed, implementing better budget management practices, and reducing repetitive resubmissions are key strategies for addressing the performance issues in the declaration processing and approval system.
