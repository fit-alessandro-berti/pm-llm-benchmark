Here’s what stands out in the sample log, why it might be happening, and SQL you can run to investigate at scale.

Key anomalies seen in the sample
- Shipping before controls:
  - 1002 shipped before credit check and stock validation.
  - 1003 shipped before confirmation and has no stock validation at all.
- Confirmation timing issues:
  - 1003 confirmed shipment after goods were already shipped (late confirmation).
  - 1004 “shipment_scheduled=N” but goods were shipped anyway.
  - 1002 shows “attempted_early=Y” at confirmation.
- Billing/payment order issues:
  - 1004 received payment before issuing the invoice and before shipping.
- Missing required steps:
  - 1003: missing Validate Stock.
  - 1004: missing Credit Check and Validate Stock.
- Register not necessarily enforced as the first step (needs verification across all cases).
- Potential risk shipment vs credit risk:
  - 1002 shipped with credit score 650 and before the check.

Why these might be happening
- Policy/gating gaps: System allows logistics steps to progress without finance/stock gates (possibly for priority orders).
- Parallel work and late logging: Managers log “Confirm Shipment” after the fact; “late_confirmation=Y” suggests backfilling.
- Process variants not modeled: Prepayment or proforma invoicing flows may exist but not captured as distinct activities.
- Training/compliance issues: Staff bypassing checklists (“shipment_scheduled=N” yet shipped).
- Data quality: Missing stock validations may be performed but not logged; inconsistent use of additional_info fields.
- Incentive/case mix: Priority orders may drive early shipment behaviors.

SQL to investigate further

1) Quick path per case (spot variants)
select case_id, string_agg(activity, ' -> ' order by "timestamp", event_id) as path
from order_event_log
group by case_id;

2) Compute first timestamps and conformance flags per case
with steps as (
  select
    case_id,
    min("timestamp") as t_first_event,
    min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'Register Order') as t_register,
    min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'Perform Credit Check') as t_credit,
    min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'Validate Stock') as t_stock,
    min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'Confirm Shipment') as t_confirm,
    min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'Ship Goods') as t_ship,
    min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'Issue Invoice') as t_invoice,
    min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'Receive Payment') as t_payment
  from order_event_log
  group by case_id
)
select
  case_id,
  (t_first_event is distinct from t_register) as register_not_first,
  (t_ship is not null and (t_credit is null or t_ship < t_credit)) as shipped_before_credit,
  (t_ship is not null and (t_stock is null or t_ship < t_stock)) as shipped_before_stock,

  (t_payment is not null and (t_invoice is null or t_payment < t_invoice)) as payment_before_invoice,
  (t_payment is not null and (t_ship is null or t_payment < t_ship)) as payment_before_ship,
  (t_credit is null) as missing_credit_check,
  (t_stock is null) as missing_stock_validation,
  (t_confirm is null) as missing_confirm_shipment,
  (t_invoice is null) as missing_invoice,
  (t_payment is null) as missing_payment,
  t_register, t_credit, t_stock, t_confirm, t_ship, t_invoice, t_payment
from steps;

3) Detail cases where shipping occurred before checks (drill-down)
with steps as (
  select
    case_id,
    min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'Perform Credit Check') as t_credit,

    min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'Ship Goods') as t_ship
  from order_event_log
  group by case_id

select *
from steps
where (t_ship is not null and (t_credit is null or t_ship < t_credit))
   or (t_ship is not null and (t_stock is null or t_ship < t_stock))
   or (t_ship is not null and (t_confirm is null or t_ship < t_confirm))
order by t_ship;

4) Confirmed unscheduled or “attempted early” shipments
select
  l.case_id,
  min(l."timestamp") as t_confirm,
  bool_or(l.additional_info ilike '%shipment_scheduled=N%') as scheduled_n_flag,
  bool_or(l.additional_info ilike '%attempted_early=Y%') as attempted_early_flag
from order_event_log l
where l.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
group by l.case_id

    or bool_or(l.additional_info ilike '%attempted_early=Y%');

5) Late confirmations (confirm after shipping)
with steps as (
  select

join orders o using (case_id)
where l.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
group by o.order_type
order by late_confirms desc, attempted_early_confirms desc;

15) Time deltas between key steps (spot unrealistic or negative intervals)
with steps as (
  select
    case_id,
    min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'Register Order') as t_register,

  t_invoice - t_ship as d_ship_to_invoice,
  t_payment - t_invoice as d_invoice_to_payment
from steps

If you want, I can help turn the violation flags into a persistent view or a materialized view for monitoring, and derive dashboards by order_type, department, or resource.
