To construct the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the given scenario, we need to define the constraints and frequency bounds for the activities involved in the order fulfillment process. Below is a possible configuration based on typical workflow constraints in such processes.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),  # No equivalence constraints specified in this scenario
    'always_before': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receive Order always comes before Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Check Availability always comes before Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserve Items always comes before Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Pick Items always comes before Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Quality Check always comes before Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # Pack Order always comes before Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # Generate Shipping Label always comes before Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),  # Dispatch always comes before Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')   # Invoice Customer always comes before Record Payment
    },
    'always_after': set(),  # No always_after constraints specified in this scenario
    'never_together': set(),  # No never_together constraints specified in this scenario
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},  # Receive Order must occur exactly once
        'CA': {1},  # Check Availability must occur exactly once
        'RI': {1},  # Reserve Items must occur exactly once
        'PI': {1},  # Pick Items must occur exactly once
        'QC': {1},  # Quality Check must occur exactly once
        'PO': {1},  # Pack Order must occur exactly once
        'GSL': {1},  # Generate Shipping Label must occur exactly once
        'D': {1},   # Dispatch must occur exactly once
        'IC': {1},  # Invoice Customer must occur exactly once
        'RP': {1}   # Record Payment must occur exactly once
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receive Order directly followed by Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Check Availability directly followed by Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserve Items directly followed by Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Pick Items directly followed by Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Quality Check directly followed by Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Pack Order directly followed by Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # Generate Shipping Label directly followed by Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),   # Dispatch directly followed by Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')   # Invoice Customer directly followed by Record Payment
    }
}

print(log_skeleton)
```

### Explanation:
- **Equivalence**: There are no activities that must always occur together or can be considered equivalent.
- **Always Before**: Each activity logically follows another, ensuring the correct sequence.
- **Always After**: Not applicable in this scenario.
- **Never Together**: No activities are mutually exclusive in this context.
- **Activity Occurrences**: Each activity is expected to happen exactly once (`{1}`).
- **Directly Follows**: Ensures the immediate sequence of activities.

This structure captures the logical dependencies and constraints for the order fulfillment process in the distribution center.
