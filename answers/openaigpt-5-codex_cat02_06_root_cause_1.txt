**Summarizing case duration analysis**

I'm calculating case durations, noting long delays often link to late investigations or Level2 escalation backlogs. I'm spotting patterns like multi-day waits post-escalation and suggesting improvements like better Level2 staffing, faster triage, and shift adjustments to reduce overnight gaps. I'll prepare a clear summary with these findings and recommendations.

**1. Tickets with unusually long cycle times**

| Case | First Event  Closure | Total Duration | Notable gaps |
|------|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 101 | 20240301 08:00  10:15 | 2h15m | – |
| 103 | 20240301 08:10  09:30 | 1h20m | – |
| **102** | 20240301 08:05  20240302 09:15 | **25h10m** | 2h30m wait after escalation before investigation; overnight wait (19h) before resolution |
| **104** | 20240301 08:20  20240302 08:30 | **24h10m** | 3h30m wait before investigation; 19h wait before resolution |
| **105** | 20240301 08:25  20240303 09:30 | **49h05m** | 28h wait after escalation before Level2 investigation; 19h wait before resolution |

Cases **102, 104, and 105** clearly deviate from the ~1–2 hour cycle seen in cases 101 and 103.

**2. Potential root causes**

- **Escalations drive extended idle periods.**  
  - Cases 102 and 105 were escalated. In both, the “Investigate Issue” step at Level2 starts hours or even a day after escalation, indicating a backlog or handoff delay in the Level2 queue.

- **Late start and completion of investigation even when no escalation occurs.**  
  - Case 104 never escalates, but it still waits 3.5 hours after assignment before investigation, then another ~19 hours before resolution—suggesting workload peaks, shift changes, or prioritization issues at Level1.

- **Overnight gaps suggest shift/coverage problems.**  
  - For cases 102, 104, and 105, key activities pause overnight. Once a case slips past normal business hours, it remains idle until the next day, inflating cycle time.

- **Escalation followup is inconsistent.**  
  - Case 105 shows a 28-hour gap between escalation and the Level2 investigation—the longest delay in the log—highlighting weak follow-up mechanisms once a ticket changes queues.

**3. How these factors inflate cycle time & recommendations**

- **Escalation bottlenecks**: Without prompt Level2 attention, escalated tickets sit idle.  
  *Recommendation*: Introduce SLA-based monitoring for escalated tickets (e.g., Level2 should start investigation within 2 hours). Implement alerts or shared dashboards so Level2 teams see aged tickets immediately.

- **Delayed investigations after assignment**: Large gaps between “Assign” and “Investigate” hint at resource contention.  
  *Recommendation*: Review staffing and workload distribution for Level1, especially around the 09:00–13:00 window. Consider a “first-touch” SLA to ensure investigations begin shortly after assignment.

- **Overnight stalls**: Tickets that hit the end of day remain dormant.  
  *Recommendation*: Ensure handoff to the next shift includes pending high-priority tickets; consider staggered shifts or on-call coverage for escalations nearing SLA breach.

- **Lack of escalation follow-through**: Case 105 shows that once escalated, tickets can get “lost.”  
  *Recommendation*: Automate reminders and require acknowledgment when Level2 receives an escalation. A structured “escalation playbook” (with escalation timestamp, responsible agent, follow-up times) can reduce these delays.

- **General monitoring**: Implement process mining dashboards or daily reviews to highlight tickets exceeding target cycle times, enabling proactive intervention before they spill into multi-day delays.

By tightening control over escalations, ensuring investigations start promptly, and smoothing handoff across shifts, the support process can prevent the long idle periods that pushed cases 102, 104, and 105 far beyond the typical 1–2 hour resolution time.
