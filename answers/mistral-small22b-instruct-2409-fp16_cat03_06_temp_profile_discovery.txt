 To create a temporal profile for the given process, we need to identify and map out each step in a chronological order based on the sequence of events described. Here’s how you can visualize the temporal profile:

1. **Create Fine**
2. **Send Fine**
3. **Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture** (Optional)
4. **Add penalty** (Optional, but usually after sending fine and notifying about fine)
5. **Insert Fine Notification**
6. **Payment** (Optional, might happen multiple times)
7. **Appeal to Judge** (If an appeal is made)
8. **Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture** (If there's an appeal and result is received)
9. **Notify Result Appeal to Offender**
10. **Send for Credit Collection** (When collection actions are necessary)

Here’s a simplified temporal profile for the process:

1. **Create Fine**
   - Triggered when a fine needs to be issued.
2. **Send Fine**
   - Immediately after creating the fine.
3. **Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture** (Conditional)
   - Only if there is an appeal scheduled.
4. **Add penalty** (Conditional)
   - If additional penalties are needed, usually after sending the fine or notifying about it.
5. **Insert Fine Notification**
   - To notify the offender about the fine.
6. **Payment** (Multiple steps, conditional)
   - Payment can occur at various stages depending on the process flow.
7. **Appeal to Judge** (Conditional)
   - If an appeal is made after exhausting other avenues or as a subsequent step.
8. **Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture** (Conditional)
   - After an appeal has been made and the prefecture provides a decision.
9. **Notify Result Appeal to Offender** (Conditional)
   - Informing the offender about the appeal result.
10. **Send for Credit Collection** (Conditional)
    - If payment is not received, collection actions are initiated.

### Example Paths:

1. **Standard Fine Process:**
   - Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment.

2. **Appeal to Prefecture Path:**
   - Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture -> Payment.

3. **Longer Process with Multiple Payments:**
   - Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment -> Payment -> Payment -> Payment.

This profile outlines the general sequence and possible branching paths based on the frequency and performance data provided. You can expand this by adding more conditional steps or refining the order based on specific process requirements or regulations.
