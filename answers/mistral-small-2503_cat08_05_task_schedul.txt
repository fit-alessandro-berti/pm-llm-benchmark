### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

**Reconstructing and Analyzing Job Flow and Task Execution:**

To analyze the actual flow of jobs and task execution sequences, we will use process mining techniques to reconstruct the process models from the MES event logs. The steps include:

1. **Event Log Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the event logs to ensure consistency and completeness. This includes handling missing values, correcting timestamps, and ensuring that all relevant events (e.g., job release, task start, task end, setup start, setup end) are captured.

2. **Process Discovery:** Use process discovery algorithms (e.g., Alpha Miner, Fodina, Heuristics Miner) to create a visual representation of the actual process flow. This will help in understanding the sequence of tasks and the flow of jobs through different machines.

3. **Conformance Checking:** Compare the discovered process models with the ideal or expected process models to identify deviations and inefficiencies.

**Quantifying Key Metrics:**

- **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
  - **Metrics:** Calculate the total time from job release to completion (lead time), and the time from the start of the first task to the end of the last task (makespan).
  - **Techniques:** Use process mining tools to extract and analyze these times for each job, and then compute distributions to identify patterns and outliers.

- **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):**
  - **Metrics:** Measure the time a job spends in the queue before being processed at each work center.
  - **Techniques:** Analyze the timestamps of queue entry and task start events to compute waiting times.

- **Resource Utilization:**
  - **Metrics:** Calculate productive time, idle time, and setup time for each machine and operator.
  - **Techniques:** Use the timestamps of task start, task end, and setup events to compute utilization metrics.

- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
  - **Metrics:** Quantify the duration of setups based on the sequence of jobs processed on a machine.
  - **Techniques:** Analyze the setup start and end events, considering the previous job processed on the same machine.

- **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
  - **Metrics:** Measure the deviation from due dates and the frequency/magnitude of delays.
  - **Techniques:** Compare the actual completion times with the due dates to calculate tardiness.

- **Impact of Disruptions:**
  - **Metrics:** Assess the impact of breakdowns and priority changes on schedules and KPIs.
  - **Techniques:** Analyze the timestamps and notes associated with disruption events to quantify their impact on job flow times and resource utilization.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

**Identifying Key Pathologies:**

- **Bottleneck Resources:**
  - **Evidence:** Use process mining to identify machines with consistently high utilization and long queue times.
  - **Impact:** Quantify the impact on overall throughput and lead times.

- **Poor Task Prioritization:**
  - **Evidence:** Analyze the sequence of task completions and compare them with due dates and priorities.
  - **Impact:** Identify instances where high-priority jobs were delayed due to suboptimal sequencing.

- **Suboptimal Sequencing:**
  - **Evidence:** Analyze setup times and identify sequences that resulted in significantly increased setup durations.
  - **Impact:** Quantify the additional time spent on setups due to poor sequencing.

- **Starvation of Downstream Resources:**
  - **Evidence:** Analyze the flow of jobs between work centers and identify instances where downstream machines were starved.
  - **Impact:** Quantify the impact on lead times and resource utilization.

- **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:**
  - **Evidence:** Analyze WIP levels over time and identify variability caused by scheduling decisions.
  - **Impact:** Quantify the impact on lead times and resource utilization.

**Process Mining Techniques:**

- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Use process mining to identify bottlenecks and quantify their impact on throughput.
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare on-time vs. late jobs to identify patterns and root causes of delays.
- **Resource Contention Analysis:** Analyze periods of high resource contention to identify scheduling inefficiencies.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

**Potential Root Causes:**

- **Static Dispatching Rules:** The current rules do not adapt to dynamic changes in the shop floor.
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Inadequate real-time data on machine availability and queue lengths.
- **Inaccurate Task Duration Estimations:** Use of inaccurate or outdated task duration estimates.
- **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:** Lack of consideration for sequence-dependent setup times.
- **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers:** Inadequate communication and coordination between different work centers.
- **Inadequate Strategies for Disruptions:** Lack of effective strategies for handling unplanned breakdowns or urgent orders.

**Differentiating Issues:**

- **Process Mining Insights:** Use process mining to differentiate between issues caused by poor scheduling logic and those caused by resource capacity limitations or inherent process variability.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a detailed root cause analysis using process mining to identify the underlying issues and their impact on scheduling performance.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

**Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules**

- **Core Logic:** Develop dynamic dispatching rules that consider multiple factors simultaneously, such as remaining processing time, due date, priority, downstream machine load, and estimated sequence-dependent setup time.
- **Process Mining Insights:** Use historical data to inform the choice and weighting of these factors.
- **Addressing Pathologies:** Improve task prioritization and sequencing to reduce delays and setup times.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduce tardiness, WIP, and lead times, and improve resource utilization.

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling**

- **Core Logic:** Use historical task duration distributions and predictive maintenance insights to generate more realistic schedules and predict potential bottlenecks or delays proactively.
- **Process Mining Insights:** Use historical data to build predictive models for task durations and breakdowns.
- **Addressing Pathologies:** Improve schedule adherence and reduce the impact of disruptions.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduce tardiness, WIP, and lead times, and improve resource utilization.

**Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization**

- **Core Logic:** Develop a strategy aimed at minimizing sequence-dependent setup times through intelligent batching of similar jobs or optimized sequencing at bottleneck machines.
- **Process Mining Insights:** Analyze historical setup patterns to inform sequencing decisions.
- **Addressing Pathologies:** Reduce setup times and improve resource utilization.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduce lead times and improve resource utilization.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

**Discrete-Event Simulation:**

- **Parameterization:** Use data derived from process mining (e.g., task time distributions, routing probabilities, breakdown frequencies, setup time models) to parameterize the simulation.
- **Scenario Testing:** Test the proposed scheduling strategies against the baseline and against each other in various scenarios (e.g., high load, frequent disruptions).
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the impact of each strategy on KPIs (tardiness, WIP, lead time, utilization).

**Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:**

- **Framework:** Develop a framework for continuous monitoring and adaptation of the chosen scheduling strategy using ongoing process mining.
- **KPI Tracking:** Track KPIs and automatically detect drifts or new inefficiencies requiring adjustments to the scheduling logic.
- **Adaptation:** Use process mining to continuously update the scheduling strategy based on new data and insights.
