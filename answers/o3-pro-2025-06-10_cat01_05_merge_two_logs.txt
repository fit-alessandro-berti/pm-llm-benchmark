Explanation of decisions
1. Timestamp strategy  
   • System A is treated as the canonical sequence, so its timestamp is the primary_ts.  
   • We still preserve System B’s original time for auditability.  
   • A tolerance of ±2 s was the default. Payment events differed by 5 s; because the event names clearly match and there are no competing candidates, they were still merged (documented as an exception).

2. Name mapping  
   Order Received  OrderReceived  
   Order Validated  OrderValidation  
   Payment Processed  PaymentCheck  
   Item Shipped  Shipping  
   (Item Delivered has no peer; Quality Check exists only in System B.)

3. Merging logic  
   • Candidate events had to share the same order_id and fall within the time tolerance (extended to 5 s for Payment).  
   • When merged, all attributes from both records are retained; missing attributes are left blank (“-”).  
   • origin column records whether the row came from A, B, or both.

4. Non-overlapping events  
   • Quality Check (10:03:00Z) is kept as a stand-alone B-only row.  
   • Item Delivered (10:20:00Z) is kept as an A-only row.

5. Conflict resolution  
   • No contradictory attribute values were encountered; if they had been, System B’s richer metadata would have been kept in a “B_*” suffix column and flagged.

The resulting log is chronologically ordered, contains every event from both sources, and provides a unified, attribute-rich view suitable for downstream analysis or process-mining.
