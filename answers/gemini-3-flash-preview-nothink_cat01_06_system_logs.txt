To transform this raw system log into a meaningful event log, I have focused on **Object-Centric Case Identification**. Instead of viewing the log as a single stream of time, I have grouped activities based on the "Subject" or "Document" being handled.

In cases where the user switched applications (e.g., switching to Excel while working on a Word document to "Update Q1 figures"), I have logically grouped those events into the primary task's Case ID if they were clearly supportive of that main goal.

### Explanation of Logic

To create an analyst-friendly event log, I applied the following logic:

#### 1. Case Identification (Grouping)
I identified four distinct work streams based on the "Window" and "Context":
*   **CASE_001 (Document Preparation):** This is the most complex case. It involves creating `Document1.docx`. I included the Excel `Budget_2024.xlsx` activities in this case because the user specifically typed "Inserting reference to budget" in the Word doc immediately after saving the Excel file. This indicates the Excel work was a dependent sub-process of the Word document creation.
*   **CASE_002 (Communication):** Grouped all activities related to the "Annual Meeting" email in Chrome.
*   **CASE_003 (Research/Review):** Grouped the activities in Adobe Acrobat involving the review of `Report_Draft.pdf`.
*   **CASE_004 (Reporting):** Grouped the "Quarterly_Report" activities. Note that this case technically started at 08:59:50 but was "paused" while the user worked on other tasks, eventually finishing at 09:08:15.

#### 2. Activity Naming (Standardization)
Low-level system events were mapped to high-level business activities to make the process map readable:
*   **FOCUS/SWITCH:** Generally ignored unless they represented the "Open" or "Resume" phase of a task.
*   **TYPING/SCROLL:** Mapped to **"Edit Content"**, **"Compose Reply"**, or **"Review & Annotate"** depending on the application context.
*   **SAVE/CLOSE:** Mapped to **"Save Document"** and **"Close Document"** to represent the completion of a process step.
*   **CLICK (Action=Send):** Mapped to a definitive process end-step: **"Send Email"**.

#### 3. Handling Interleaving (Multi-tasking)
The raw log shows the user jumping between tasks (e.g., working on a document, checking an email, going back to the document). By using **Case IDs**, process mining tools can "untangle" these overlapping events to show the actual cycle time and flow of each individual task, rather than just a chronological list of clicks.
