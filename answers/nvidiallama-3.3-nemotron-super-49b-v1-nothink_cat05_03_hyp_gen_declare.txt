### **1. Identified Anomalies in the DECLARE Model**

| **Anomaly ID** | **Affected Constraints** | **Description of Anomaly** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A1**     | `precedence` for "C" & `init` implicit for "R"  "C" | "Close Claim (C)" is constrained to be preceded by "Receive Claim (R)", yet "R" is only specified as an initial activity, not necessarily leading to "C". This might imply potential missing constraints for activities between R and C. |
| **A2**     | `responded_existence` for "E" & `noncoexistence` for "E" and "C" | "Evaluate Claim (E)" is required after "Assign Adjuster (A)", but "E" and "Close Claim (C)" are constrained to not coexist, creating a contradiction if "C" is expected to follow "E" logically. |
| **A3**     | `existence` for "C" & Implicit Process Flow | Mandating the existence of "Close Claim (C)" without explicit constraints for all preceding activities (especially "N" - Notify Customer) in the model undermines the intended process flow. |
| **A4**     | `precedence` for "C" only requiring "R" | "Close Claim (C)" only requires "Receive Claim (R)" to have occurred beforehand, ignoring the necessity of other steps like "Evaluate (E)" and "Approve (P)" in a typical claim processing workflow. |

### **2. Hypotheses for the Presence of Anomalies**

| **Hypothesis ID** | **Hypothesis** |
| --- | --- |
| **H1**     | **Rushed Model Development**: Constraints were added hastily without thorough review, leading to oversights. |
| **H2**     | **Miscommunication with Stakeholders**: Model developers misunderstood critical business process requirements. |
| **H3**     | **Evolution of Business Rules**: Policy changes were not consistently updated across all model constraints. |
| **H4**     | **Data-Driven Misconceptions**: Analysis of incomplete or biased data led to the formulation of inaccurate constraints. |
| **H5**     | **Pressure for Simplification**: The need for a simplified model overlooked essential complexity of the claim processing workflow. |

### **3. Proposed Verification Approaches with SQL Queries**

#### **a. Checking for Claims Closed Without Evaluation or Approval**

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, ce1.activity AS "LastActivityBeforeClose"
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'C'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P') AND ce2.timestamp < ce1.timestamp
WHERE ce2.event_id IS NULL;
```

#### **b. Identifying Evaluation and Close Coexistence Violations**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_e ON c.claim_id = ce_e.claim_id AND ce_e.activity = 'E'
JOIN claim_events ce_c ON c.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id AND ce_c.activity = 'C' AND ce_c.timestamp < ce_e.timestamp;
```

#### **c. Ensuring Evaluation Steps Follow Assignments**

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, ce_a.timestamp AS "AssignTime", ce_e.timestamp AS "EvaluateTime"
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_a ON c.claim_id = ce_a.claim_id AND ce_a.activity = 'A'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_e ON c.claim_id = ce_e.claim_id AND ce_e.activity = 'E' AND ce_e.timestamp > ce_a.timestamp
WHERE ce_e.event_id IS NULL;
```

#### **d. Checking for Mandatory Activities Before Closure**

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, 
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "HasR",
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "HasA",
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "HasE",
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "HasP",
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "HasN"
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING HasR = 0 OR HasA = 0 OR HasE = 0 OR HasP = 0 OR HasN = 0;
```
