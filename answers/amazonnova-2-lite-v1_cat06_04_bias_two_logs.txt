### **Comparison and Identification of Bias**

To analyze bias in the event logs, we need to compare the processing of applications from the **Protected Group (Group A)** and the **Unprotected Group (Group B)**, focusing on the influence of the following attributes:

- **LocalResident**: A boolean indicating whether the applicant is a local resident.
- **CommunityGroup**: The community or organization the applicant belongs to (if any).
- **ScoreAdjustment**: Any modifications to the **PreliminaryScore** that occur during processing.
- **FinalDecision**: The ultimate outcome of the application.

---

## **Step 1: Overview of Processing Flow**

Both groups follow the same sequence of activities:
1. **ApplicationReceived**
2. **DataValidation**
3. **PreliminaryScoring**
4. **ManualReview**
5. **FinalDecision**

However, **the behavior diverges** in the **PreliminaryScoring** and **ManualReview** steps, particularly due to the **ScoreAdjustment** column.

---

## **Step 2: Data Summary**

### **Group A (Protected Group)**

All applicants are **non-local residents** (`LocalResident = FALSE`) and **do not belong to any community group** (`CommunityGroup = None`).

| CaseID | PreliminaryScore | ScoreAdjustment | FinalDecision |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| P001   | 720               | 0               | Approved      |
| P002   | 710               | 0               | Rejected      |
| P003   | 740               | 0               | Approved      |

- **No score adjustments** are applied.
- Final decisions are based **solely on the PreliminaryScore**.
- Threshold for approval appears to be **above 715** (P001 = 720  Approved, P002 = 710  Rejected, P003 = 740  Approved).

---

### **Group B (Unprotected Group)**

All applicants are **local residents** (`LocalResident = TRUE`). Some belong to the **Highland Civic Darts Club**, and others do not belong to any community group.

| CaseID | PreliminaryScore | ScoreAdjustment       | FinalDecision |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| U001   | 720               | +10 (Community Boost)  | Approved      |
| U002   | 710               | 0                      | Rejected      |
| U003   | 695               | +10 (Community Boost)  | Approved      |

- **Score adjustments** are applied **only for applicants in the "Highland Civic Darts Club"**.
- The **Community Boost** increases the score by **+10**.
- This adjustment impacts final decisions:
  - U001: 720  730  Approved
  - U003: 695  705  Approved (would have been Rejected without boost)
- U002 (no community group) is **rejected** at 710, the same score as P002 (also rejected), despite being a **local resident**.

---

## **Step 3: Identifying Bias**

### **1. Disparate Impact of CommunityGroup Attribute**

- **Group B applicants who belong to the Highland Civic Darts Club receive an automatic +10 score boost**, while **Group A applicants receive no such boost**, even if they were part of a similar community (but they aren't).
- This creates a **systemic advantage** for **local residents in a specific community group**, which is **not mirrored for non-local residents**, even if they might belong to similar or equivalent groups.

### **2. LocalResident Attribute Influence**

- **Group B (Unprotected Group)** applicants are all **local residents**, yet **U002 is rejected at 710**, the same score as **P002 (Protected Group)**.
- **P002** is rejected **without any boost**, while **U002** also has **no boost** and is rejected — suggesting **the same threshold applies**.
- However, **U003**, a local resident with a **lower preliminary score (695)**, **benefits from the community boost** and is approved, whereas **a similar non-local resident with 695 would likely be rejected**.

This indicates that **LocalResident status alone is not sufficient to guarantee fairness**, but **when combined with CommunityGroup membership**, it **triggers a bias in favor of the Unprotected Group**.

---

## **Step 4: Manifestation of Bias**

### **a. Favoritism Toward Specific CommunityGroup**

- The **CommunityGroup attribute** triggers a **score adjustment (+10)** **only for Group B**.
- This results in **U003**, who would have been rejected at 695, being **approved after the boost**.
- There is **no comparable adjustment** for Group A applicants, even if they belonged to a community (though none do in this sample).

### **b. Indirect Discrimination via LocalResident + CommunityGroup Combination**

- The combination of **LocalResident = TRUE** and **CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club** **automatically triggers a score increase**, which **alters the decision outcomes**.
- This creates a **two-tiered system**:
  - **Tier 1:** Local residents in the favored community group receive **automatic score boosts**.
  - **Tier 2:** Everyone else (including local residents not in the group and all non-local residents) **does not receive this benefit**.

### **c. Disparate Outcomes for Similar Scores**

| Applicant | Group     | LocalResident | CommunityGroup                | Score | Decision |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|-------|----------|
| P002      | Protected | FALSE         | None                          | 710   | Rejected |
| U002      | Unprotected | TRUE        | None                          | 710   | Rejected |
| U003      | Unprotected | TRUE        | Highland Civic Darts Club     | 695  705 | Approved |

- **U003** is approved **despite a lower base score** due to the **community boost**, while **P002 and U002**, with equal or higher base scores, are **rejected**.
- This shows **bias in favor of a specific subgroup** (local residents in a particular community), even though they started with **lower qualifications**.

---

## **Conclusion: Evidence of Bias**

###  **Yes, bias is present in the logs.**

### **How the Bias Manifests:**

1. **Community-Based Score Boosting:**
   - Only **Group B** applicants in the **Highland Civic Darts Club** receive a **+10 score adjustment**.
   - This adjustment **alters decision outcomes**, allowing **lower-qualified applicants** to be approved.

2. **Disparate Treatment of Equivalent Scores:**
   - **Group A applicants** with scores of **710 and 720** are treated **differently** from **Group B applicants** with the **same scores**, **depending on community membership**.
   - This indicates that **membership in a specific community overrides baseline qualifications**.

3. **Structural Inequality:**
   - The system **favors local residents who belong to a specific community group**, creating a **two-tiered approval process**.
   - This leads to **systemic disadvantage for non-local residents and local residents not in the favored group**.

---

## **Recommendation**

To address this bias:

1. **Eliminate Community-Based Score Adjustments** unless they are **demonstrably justified** and **applied uniformly** across all groups.
2. **Audit scoring rules** to ensure **no subgroup receives automatic boosts** that affect decision outcomes.
3. **Ensure transparency** in how attributes like `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` influence scores and decisions.

Only through **fair, consistent, and neutral criteria** can the system avoid **disparate impact** and ensure **equitable treatment** of all applicants.
