The constraints provided outline a process in which certain activities must occur, while others cannot. Here's a breakdown of how these constraints might shape the workflow, specifically related to declarations and payment handling:

1. **Initialization**: Every trace starts with an activity by 'EMPLOYEE' submitting a declaration ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE').

2. **Existence & Exactly 1**:
   - Each key event: Request Payment, Payment Handled, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, and Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE must occur exactly once in the workflow.

3. **Precedence**: This defines a direct order of activities:
   - A declaration must be submitted before it can be finalized (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE  Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
   - Payment handling comes after both submission and final approval.
   
4. **Chain Precedence & Chain Succession**:
   - These constraints refine the order to ensure specific sequences of activities: 'Request Payment' must come after a declaration is approved (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR  Request Payment), which in turn triggers payment handling (Request Payment  Payment Handled).

5. **Response and Alternate Response**: Ensure that for every request or action taken, there's an appropriate response:
   - Each request/payment handling involves an alternate response scenario where actions must be interspersed without repetition.
   
6. **Succession & Alternate Succession**:
   - Similar to responses but with the added condition of directly-follows relations, ensuring each activity is succeeded by specific others in a particular order (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED  Request Payment/Declaration FINAL_APPROVED).

7. **Co-Existence**: This ensures that certain activities must happen together or overlap within the process:
   - For instance, 'Request Payment' cannot occur without 'Payment Handled', and similar coexistence rules apply to other pairs like between employee submission/approval stages.

8. **Absence**:
   - Specifies activities that are not part of this workflow (such as rejection by different stakeholders or administrative actions).

9. **Responded Existence**: This constraint emphasizes the necessity for certain events in response to others, ensuring a balanced workflow where each action is met with a corresponding reaction (e.g., 'Payment Handled' follows 'Request Payment').

### Process Flow Summary:
- The process starts when an employee submits a declaration.
- After submission, a supervisor must approve it.
- Once the approval happens, the next step involves requesting payment for which the final activity is handling the payment.
- All activities (submission, approval, request, and payment handling) must occur exactly once.
- Certain pairs of actions must coexist or follow each other strictly as per the given constraints.

This model ensures a strict and sequential flow of events from declaration submission to payment processing, with specific conditions met along the way.
