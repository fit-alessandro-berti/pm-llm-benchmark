We need to produce a prompt for the target LLM. The user wants us to create a prompt that encourages the target model to identify anomalies, hypothesize reasons, and propose relevant SQL queries. We should not give hints or guidance; just provide the prompt.

We need to output a prompt that includes instructions: "Identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the given event log. Hypothesize why these anomalies might occur... Propose relevant SQL queries on order_event_log (and possibly orders and resources) to investigate these hypotheses further without any hints or guidance provided here."

We should incorporate details: database type PostgreSQL, schema description, example data. Provide context but not too much? The user says "The target model should be encouraged to: ...". So we need to produce a prompt that instructs the LLM accordingly.

Thus we will output something like:

"Given the following PostgreSQL database schema and sample event log data for orders, please..."

But we must not give hints or guidance beyond what is necessary.

Also we must follow formatting rules: use LaTeX for math expressions if needed; but likely none needed.

We can include code blocks for SQL queries? But it's just a prompt; no actual queries yet.

We can present as plain text with maybe bullet points.

Let's craft:


	You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing an event log stored in PostgreSQL.
	...
	Your tasks:
	1. Identify any anomalies or undesirable patterns in the event sequences.
	2. For each anomaly, hypothesize possible causes (system errors, policy violations, etc.).
	3. Suggest specific SQL queries you would run on `order_event_log` (and optionally `orders`, `resources`) to investigate each hypothesis.

Make sure no extra explanation beyond that.

Ok produce final answer accordingly.

**Prompt for Target LLM**

You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing an event‑log database stored in PostgreSQL.  
The database contains three tables:

| Table | Key Columns | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `order_event_log` | `case_id`, `event_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, `resource`, `additional_info` | Stores every activity performed on an order |
| `orders` | `case_id`, `customer_id`, `order_type`, `order_value` | Holds static order attributes |
| `resources` | `resource_id`, `role`, `department` | Describes who performed each activity |

A sample of typical process flow is:

1️⃣ Register Order (Sales)  
2️⃣ Perform Credit Check (Finance)  
3️⃣ Validate Stock (Warehouse)  
4️⃣ Confirm Shipment (Logistics)  
5️⃣ Ship Goods (Logistics)  
6️⃣ Issue Invoice (Finance)  
7️⃣ Receive Payment (Finance)

The provided example rows illustrate normal cases as well as deviations such as missing steps, out‑of‑sequence events, duplicate activities, early shipments before credit checks, etc.

**Your tasks**

1. **Detect Anomalies** – Scan the event sequences per case (`case_id`) and list any irregularities or undesirable patterns you observe.
2. **Hypothesize Causes** – For each anomaly identified above, propose plausible reasons it might have occurred (e.g., system glitches, human error, policy violations).
3. **Propose Investigative Queries** – Suggest concrete SQL statements you would run against the tables (`order_event_log`; optionally joining with `orders` or `resources`) to test each hypothesis further.

*Do not provide any additional explanations or guidance beyond what is required.*
