Here is my analysis of the event log, with inferred activity labels and the rationale behind them.

---

### **Identified Manufacturing Activities:**

#### **1. Idle / Standby Mode** (Events 1-3, 13-15)
- **Indicators:** Low temperature (20-21°C), no vibration, no material flow, no tool movement, and minimal energy consumption.
- **Interpretation:** The machine is in a standby state, waiting for an operation to begin.

#### **2. Cutting Metal** (Events 4-6)
- **Indicators:** Sharp increase in temperature (from 21°C to 58°C), significant vibration (30-38 Hz), material flow begins (5 units/s), tool position changes, and increased energy consumption.
- **Interpretation:** Cutting operations generate heat and vibration. The increase in material flow suggests metal is being fed into a cutting tool.

#### **3. Assembling Parts** (Events 7-8)
- **Indicators:** Lower but stable temperature (40°C), reduced vibration (10 Hz), slower material flow (2 units/s), tool position stabilizes at 15 mm, and consistent energy consumption (2.00 kWh).
- **Interpretation:** Moderate machine activity suggests parts are being aligned or fastened together.

#### **4. Welding** (Event 9)
- **Indicators:** Sudden spike in temperature (80°C), very high vibration (50 Hz), no material flow, stable tool position, and high energy consumption (5.00 kWh).
- **Interpretation:** Welding generates extreme heat and vibrations but does not require additional material flow, supporting the idea that this event represents a welding step.

#### **5. Quality Inspection** (Events 10-12)
- **Indicators:** Temperature drops (30°C → 25°C), vibration stabilizes at a low level (1-5 Hz), minimal material flow, and tool position changes slightly.
- **Interpretation:** The machine appears to be engaged in a lower-energy task, likely inspecting or measuring the finished product.

### **Final Labeled Process Flow:**
1. **Idle / Standby Mode** (Events 1-3)
2. **Cutting Metal** (Events 4-6)
3. **Assembling Parts** (Events 7-8)
4. **Welding** (Event 9)
5. **Quality Inspection** (Events 10-12)
6. **Idle / Standby Mode** (Events 13-15)

These labels provide a structured understanding of the manufacturing process based on sensor patterns, linking raw data to meaningful activities in the assembly line.
