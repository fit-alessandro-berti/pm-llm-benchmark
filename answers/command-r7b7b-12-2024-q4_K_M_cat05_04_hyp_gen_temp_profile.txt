## Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model:

1. **Short "R to P" (Receive to Approve) Interval:** The average time between 'R' (Receive) and 'P' (Approve) activities is suspiciously short at around 25 hours, with a very low standard deviation of only one hour. This could indicate an artificial or rigid schedule for approval processes that doesn't align with typical business logic, possibly suggesting the presence of internal rules or constraints that expedite this step.

2. **Long "P to N" (Approve to Notify) Interval:** The average time between 'P' and 'N' activities is extremely long at 7 days, with a high standard deviation of two days. This suggests inconsistent and unpredictable wait times between approval and notification, possibly indicating potential internal backlog or resource constraints affecting timely customer communication.

3. **Quick "E to N" (Evaluate to Notify) Transition:** With only 5 minutes on average between 'E' (Evaluate) and 'N' activities, this process transition appears too rapid. It may imply the bypassing of essential checks, potentially compromising the quality of evaluations or leading to overlooked critical details.

4. **Quick "A to C" (Assign to Close) Closure:** The short average time interval of 2 hours between 'A' and 'C' activities, without intermediate steps like evaluation and approval, suggests potential premature closure practices. This could be a red flag for rushed decision-making or insufficient processing of claims.

## Hypotheses on Anomalies:

- **Systemic Delays:** Manual data entry errors or human interventions might introduce delays at various stages, causing longer-than-expected intervals between activities.

- **Automated Efficiency Concerns:** Rapid transitions like 'E to N' could indicate automated processes that bypass necessary checks, suggesting potential oversights in the system's logic.

- **Resource Allocation Issues:** Bottlenecks in certain activities might lead to extended waiting times for subsequent steps. Inconsistent resource availability across different regions or customer segments could also contribute to irregular timing patterns.

## Verification Queries:

1. **Identify Anomalous Time Intervals:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
       claim_id,
       activity AS source_activity,
       activity + '...' AS target_activity, -- Replace '...' with the next activity in sequence
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) / 3600) AS avg_time_hours,
       STDDEV_POP(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) / 3600) AS stdev_time_hours
   FROM
       claim_events t1
   JOIN
       claim_events t2 ON t1.claim_id = t2.claim_id AND t2.activity = 'target_activity'
   WHERE
       t1.activity <> 'C' -- Exclude closing event for now
   GROUP BY
       claim_id, source_activity, target_activity
   HAVING
       avg_time_hours < 3 OR stdev_time_hours > 6;
   ```

2. **Correlate with Adjuster and Claim Type:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
       ca.claim_id,
       a.name AS adjuster_name,
       c.claim_type,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) / 3600) AS avg_time_hours
   FROM
       claim_events t1
   JOIN
       claim_events t2 ON t1.claim_id = t2.claim_id AND t2.activity = 'target_activity'
   JOIN
       claims c ON t1.claim_id = c.claim_id
   JOIN
       adjusters a ON t1.resource = a.adjuster_id
   WHERE
       t1.activity <> 'C' -- Exclude closing event for now
   GROUP BY
       ca.claim_id, a.name, c.claim_type;
   ```

3. **Customer and Region Analysis:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
       claim_id,
       customer_id,
       region,
       ... (Additional columns as needed) ...
   FROM
       claims
   WHERE
       ... (Conditions based on hypothesis) ...
   ORDER BY
       region, customer_id; -- Sort by region to analyze patterns across regions.
   ```
