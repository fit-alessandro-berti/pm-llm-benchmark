# You can visualize these models using pm4py's visualization capabilities if needed.
# For example:
# from pm4py.visualization.powl.visualizer import apply as vis_apply
# vis_apply(unfair_model, "unfair_model.png")
# vis_apply(fair_model, "fair_model.png")

print("Unfair Model Structure:")
print(unfair_model) # Prints the POWL structure to the console
print("\nFair Model Structure:")
print(fair_model) # Prints the POWL structure to the console

```

Key changes and explanations:

* **Unfair Model:** The `xor_branch` now explicitly represents the choice between the standard `CulturalFitCheck` and the `CommunityAffiliationCheck`.  This XOR operator clearly shows the point where the process diverges, introducing the potential for bias.

* **Fair Model:**  The `CommunityAffiliationCheck` is completely removed.  All applicants proceed directly from `SkillAssessment` to `CulturalFitCheck2`, ensuring everyone is evaluated on the same criteria.  The loop for data completeness is still present, as is the sequential flow through the other stages, but the biased branching is eliminated.

* **Printing the structure:** Added `print()` statements at the end to output the structure of both models to the console. This enables you to verify the model structure programmatically.  This is useful for debugging and making sure the structure is what you intend it to be.

* **Visualization (Commented out):** I've included commented-out code to visualize the POWL models using pm4py. If you have pm4py installed, uncomment these lines to generate PNG images of the workflows. This is extremely helpful for understanding the flow visually.  Make sure you have graphviz installed for the visualization to work.  You can install it on most systems using a package manager (e.g., `apt-get install graphviz` on Debian/Ubuntu).

This revised response provides a clear and distinct representation of the two hiring processes in POWL, highlighting the source of potential unfairness in the first model and its absence in the second. The inclusion of the print statements makes the structure of the models explicit and easy to verify.  The visualization code, when uncommented and with graphviz installed, provides an even clearer understanding of the process flow.
