This temporal profile:
1. Includes both direct sequential pairs and strategic long-span dependencies
2. Embodies industrial-scale timing patterns (full durations up to ~15 days)
3. Maintains Gaussian variance calculations for multi-step processes
4. Highlights crucial path dependencies like (QI, DT) and (SS, CA)
5. Follows the supply chain's progression while demonstrating complex temporal relationships
6. Preserves causal precedence while quantifying realistic operational uncertainties
