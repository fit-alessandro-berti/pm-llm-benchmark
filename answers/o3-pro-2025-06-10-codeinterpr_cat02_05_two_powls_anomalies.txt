1. Normative “Hire-to-Retire” reference flow  
Post Job Ad  Screen Candidates  Conduct Interviews  Make Hiring Decision  Onboard Employee  Add Employee to Payroll  Close Case  
All activities are mandatory and the arrows are strict precedence relations (no activity may be skipped and none may be executed prematurely).


2. What each POWL model actually allows

Model 1  (StrictPartialOrder)  
• Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates.  
• After Screen_Candidates the model branches into two *unordered* paths:  
– Conduct_Interviews  
– Make_Hiring_Decision  
• Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case.

Model 2  (StrictPartialOrder + loop + XOR)  
• Post_Job_Ad splits in parallel into Screen_Candidates and Conduct_Interviews (no order between them).  
• Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision.  
• Make_Hiring_Decision  *(Onboard_Employee, )(loop: Onboard can be repeated indefinitely).  
• After the loop an XOR chooses between  
– Add_to_Payroll  
–  (skip)  
• Then Close_Case.


3. Anomalies in each model

Model 1  
A1. Premature hiring decision – Because Make_Hiring_Decision is not ordered after Conduct_Interviews, the model allows a decision to be taken immediately after screening, possibly before any interview is finished.  
A2. Missing dependency between Interviews and Decision – The decision does *not* need to observe the interview outcome at all.  
(Every activity remains mandatory and can happen at most once; payroll cannot be skipped.)

Model 2  
B1. Screening and interviews may overlap or interviews may start first (Post  Interview has no preceding Screen finished). This breaks the usual “screen-then-interview” logic.  
B2. Optional payroll – The XOR makes Add_to_Payroll skippable. The case may be closed with a hired employee who never reaches the payroll system; this violates legal, financial and HR controls.  
B3. Unbounded / repeated onboarding – The loop allows Onboard_Employee to run an arbitrary number of times (or get stuck in an infinite loop), which is unrealistic.  
B4. Hiring decision does not depend on completion of screening (only on interviews), so screening could still be running—or never finish—when the decision is made.  
(The combination of B2 and B3 threatens both correctness and soundness.)


4. Which model is closer to the normative process?

Model 1 is the better approximation.

Reasoning  
• All essential activities (including Payroll) are mandatory and executed exactly once, preserving the fundamental business semantics and control points.  
• The only anomaly is the missing precedence between “Conduct Interviews” and “Make Hiring Decision”; this is a sequencing error that can be fixed by adding one edge.  
• No activity can be skipped, the process always terminates, and financial integrity is maintained.

In Model 2, by contrast, the XOR that allows skipping payroll (B2) is a severe violation of the Hire-to-Retire essence: a hired employee must be paid. The loop permitting endless or repeated onboarding (B3) impairs soundness, and the weakened ordering of early phases (B1, B4) further distances the model from standard practice.

Hence, despite its sequencing flaw, Model 1 preserves the core logic and control-flow obligations of a normative Hire-to-Retire workflow far better than Model 2.
