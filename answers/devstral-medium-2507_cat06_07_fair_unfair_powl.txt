### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model includes an XOR branching after the skill assessment, where one branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other to a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" activity that gives a subtle advantage if the applicant is affiliated with a known local group.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for data completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define XOR branching for cultural fit and community affiliation check
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model ensures no special community-based branch exists. Instead, all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for data completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### Explanation

1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**
   - The model includes an XOR branching after the skill assessment.
   - One branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation (`CulturalFitCheck`).
   - The other branch leads to a `CommunityAffiliationCheck` activity, which gives a subtle advantage if the applicant is affiliated with a known local group.
   - This branching can introduce bias, as applicants with certain affiliations may receive preferential treatment.

2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness:**
   - The model ensures that all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process (`CulturalFitCheck`).
   - There is no XOR branching for community affiliation, removing the potential source of bias.
   - The process remains fair and transparent, with all applicants evaluated on the same criteria.

Both models include a loop for data completeness and a sequence for skill checks, but the second model removes the XOR branch providing selective advantages, ensuring a fair hiring process.
