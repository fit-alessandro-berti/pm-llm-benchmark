## Analysis of Event Log Violations

Based on the provided normative process description and event log, the following cases violate the defined process flow:

**1. Case ID: 3**

*   **Violation:** This case violates the constraint that "Cancel order" should only occur after "Check inventory".  The process flow in Case 3 is "Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order".
*   **Explanation:** The normative process explicitly states that the inventory check *must* precede any authorization of payment.  Here, the order is cancelled after inventory is checked but before payment authorization, violating this core constraint.  Furthermore, shipping an order after it has been cancelled is illogical and disallowed by the normative process description, which specifies that "Ship order" should not occur after "Cancel order."  The process flow should be "Receive Order -> Check Inventory -> Cancel Order -> Close Order".

**2. Case ID: 4**

*   **Violation:** This case violates the constraint that "Check inventory" should occur before "Cancel order". The process flow in Case 4 is "Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order".
*   **Explanation:** Similar to Case 3, this case violates the normative process constraint requiring inventory checks *prior* to cancellation.  The normative process outlines "Receive Order -> Check Inventory -> Cancel Order -> Close Order" as the appropriate sequence when inventory is insufficient.  The order is cancelled immediately after the inventory check, skipping any potential payment authorization or packaging stages.

**3. Case ID: 2**

*   **Violation:** This case violates the constraint that "Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping.  The process flow in Case 2 is "Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order".
*   **Explanation:** This case has "Package items" appearing before "Authorize payment". The normative process specifies that "Authorize payment" must occur before "Package items". The process flow should be "Receive Order -> Check Inventory -> Authorize Payment -> Package Items -> Ship Order -> Close Order". 

**Summary of Violations**

| Case ID | Violation                                    | Reason                                                                                                                   |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3       | Cancellation before Check Inventory       |  Violates the requirement that inventory must be checked *before* a cancellation.                                      |
| 4       | Cancellation before Check Inventory       | Violates the requirement that inventory must be checked *before* a cancellation.                                      |
| 2       | Package Items before Authorization        | Violates the requirement that "Authorize payment" must occur before "Package items".                                          |

These cases deviate from the normative process description, indicating potential issues in how orders are being handled in the system. The violations highlight gaps in adherence to the intended workflow and suggest a need to review and potentially adjust processes to align with the established guidelines.
