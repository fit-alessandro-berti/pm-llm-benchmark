**Assumptions and Notes:**

*   **Order Dispatched/Arrived for 1004:**  There are no delivery records for order 1004.  I've marked these activities as "N/A" to indicate missing data.
*   **Resource/Actor:**  I'm using the `picker_id`, `carrier_id`, and `billing_person_id` to populate the "Resource/Actor" column.  For payments, I've marked it as "N/A" as there's no specific actor identified in the payment table.
*   **Multiple Deliveries:** Order 1002 has two delivery records, indicating multiple shipments. I'm creating separate "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events for each delivery.
*   **Timestamp Precision:**  I'm using the full timestamp provided in the tables.
*   **Missing Data:**  If data is missing for a specific event (e.g., a missing resource), I'm marking it as "N/A".
*   **Products and Resources Tables:** I'm not directly using the Products and Resources tables in this event log, but they could be used to enrich the data further (e.g., adding product descriptions or resource names).
*   **Chronological Order:** The order of events is determined by the timestamps.
*   **Activity Naming:** I'm using descriptive names for the activities based on the context of the tables.
