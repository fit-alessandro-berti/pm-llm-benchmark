Review of the POWL structure (indented to show the hierarchy)

  R  = Receive Order  
  XOR(C , ) =  Check Credit  OR  silently skip it  
  LOOP(A , I) =  first do Approve Order, then
                any number of times execute Issue Invoice
                and go back to Approve Order again ( is the implicit “exit”)  
  P  = Receive Payment  
  O  = Close Order  

Anomalies found

1. Optional credit check  
   • The XOR directly after “Receive Order” lets the process take a -path and bypass “Check Credit”.  
   • In an order-to-cash scenario the credit check is a mandatory risk-control step; omitting it can lead to accepting insolvent customers or orders that exceed credit limits.

2. Optional AND repeatable invoicing  
   • The LOOP contains only two explicit children (A, I).  
     – Semantics of a two-branch LOOP in PM4Py:  
       1st child (“do”) must be executed once (Approve Order).  
       2nd child (“redo”) may be executed 0…n times (Issue Invoice), each time cycling back to the first child again.  
       The “exit” branch is an implicit ; the loop may leave after any cycle.  
   • Consequences:  
     – Invoice can be skipped entirely (A  -exit).  
     – Invoice can be produced several times (A  I  A  I …).  
     – Approval itself is also repeated every time the loop rolls back.

3. Payment allowed without any invoice  
   • Because the loop may exit right after the mandatory first approval, the model accepts the trace  
     R  (skip credit)  A  -exit  Receive Payment  Close Order.  
   • In the real world a payment is normally triggered by an invoice; accepting payments that have no invoice reference hampers reconciliation and legal compliance.

4. Multiple approvals & invoices before one payment  
   • The structure permits sequences such as  
     R  C  A  I  A  I  A    P  O.  
   • A many-to-one relation between invoices and the final payment is created, which is rarely intended and usually signals rework, correction loops, or even duplicate billing attempts.

Why these anomalies matter

Risk and compliance  
• Skipping the credit check exposes the company to un-assessed credit risk and violates standard credit-management policies.  
• Receiving payment without a documented invoice breaks tax, auditing, and legal requirements.

Efficiency and data quality  
• Repeatedly approving the same order and repeatedly issuing invoices inflate workload and introduce duplicated records in ERP and accounting systems.  
• Extra iterations often hide rework, system glitches, or manual workarounds that should be eliminated.

Conformance and monitoring  
• Such flexible paths make conformance checking almost meaningless: nearly any sequence of (Approve, Invoice) repetitions will look “compliant” to the model, masking real deviations.  
• KPI calculations (e.g., “first-time-right rate”, “average approvals per order”) are distorted because the model treats abnormal loops as legitimate.

Typical repair suggestions

1. Replace XOR(C, ) by a mandatory “Check Credit”.  
2. Express the normal linear sequence “Approve Order  Issue Invoice” with no loop, or add an explicit controlled rework branch that logs a reason.  
3. Ensure “Issue Invoice” is mandatory before “Receive Payment”.  
4. If re-approval is really allowed after changes, model it as a separate exception flow with clear entry and exit conditions.

By tightening these points the model would represent the expected order-to-cash procedure, enabling meaningful conformance analysis and safeguarding financial and operational integrity.
