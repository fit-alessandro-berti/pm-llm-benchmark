After carefully analyzing the event log and comparing each case to the normative process description, I have identified the following violations:

Case 2 Violations:
1. "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment". The description clearly states that payment authorization should occur before packaging, as packaging is only appropriate once payment is confirmed.

Case 3 Violations:
1. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order". The description specifies that once an order is canceled, it should not proceed to activities like shipping. Shipping after cancellation is illogical and violates the expected flow.
2. "Authorize payment" occurs despite the order being canceled. If an order is canceled due to insufficient inventory, payment authorization should not occur at all.

Case 5 Violations:
1. "Ship order" occurs without the "Package items" activity. The description states that items should be packaged before shipping. Skipping the packaging step and shipping directly after payment authorization violates the logical sequence.

All other cases (1 and 4) appear to follow the normative process as described.

In terms of interpreting ambiguities, I considered the following:
- While the description doesn't explicitly forbid other activities between "Check inventory" and "Authorize payment" or "Cancel order", the general principle seems to be that this decision point should directly lead to either the payment or cancellation path. Inserting other activities here would deviate from the expected flow.
- The description doesn't specify whether "Authorize payment" must immediately follow "Check inventory" in cases where inventory is sufficient. However, given the emphasis on authorizing payment only after confirming inventory, I interpreted any significant deviation from this sequence (like in Case 2) as a violation.
- Although not stated outright, I inferred that "Package items" is a necessary precursor to "Ship order" based on the logical sequence described. Thus, I flagged Case 5 for skipping this assumed requirement.

In summary, Cases 2, 3, and 5 contain clear violations of the key constraints and principles outlined in the normative process description, while the other cases align with the expected flow. The identified violations relate to the sequence of payment authorization, packaging, shipping, and cancellation activities. My interpretations aim to resolve ambiguities in a way that maintains the general logic and intent conveyed in the process description.
