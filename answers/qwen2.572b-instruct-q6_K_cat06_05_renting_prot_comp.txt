To identify potential unfair differences in treatment between the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, we can analyze the process variants for both groups in terms of their frequency and performance (execution time). Here are the key observations:

### 1. **Rejection Rate Differences:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - The most common rejection path is `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant` with a frequency of 1036 and performance of 270,000.477.
     - Another common rejection path is `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant` with a frequency of 484 and performance of 89,999.306.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The most common rejection path is `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant` with a frequency of 2490 and performance of 400,004.640.
     - Another common rejection path is `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant` with a frequency of 674 and performance of 240,000.654.

   **Observation:**
   - The unprotected group has significantly higher frequencies in the more detailed rejection paths (e.g., including paperwork and screening) compared to the protected group.
   - This suggests that the unprotected group is subjected to more rigorous screening processes before rejection, which could be an indication of bias or additional barriers.

### 2. **Performance (Execution Time):**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - The average performance for rejection paths (e.g., `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant`) is around 89,999.306.
     - For more detailed paths (e.g., including extensive screening and contract signing), the performance can range from 449,997.746 to over 1,259,993.929.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The average performance for rejection paths (e.g., `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant`) is around 400,004.640.
     - For more detailed paths, the performance can range from 640,003.769 to over 1,280,091.444.

   **Observation:**
   - The protected group generally has longer execution times for more detailed processes, which could indicate that they are being subjected to more extensive and time-consuming scrutiny.
   - However, the unprotected group also has long execution times for detailed paths, but these are less frequent compared to the protected group's rejection paths.

### 3. **Success Rates:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - The success paths (e.g., `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> ...`) are less frequent and have longer execution times.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The success paths are more frequent but generally have shorter execution times.

   **Observation:**
   - The protected group has fewer successful outcomes, and when they do succeed, the process is much longer. This could indicate that the protected group faces more obstacles and delays in the application process.

### 4. **Extensive Screening:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Many paths include extensive screening (e.g., `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> ...`).
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - While some paths also include extensive screening, they are less frequent compared to the protected group.

   **Observation:**
   - The protected group is more likely to be subjected to extensive screening, which could be an additional barrier to successful tenancy.

### Conclusion:
The main differences suggest that the protected group faces more rigorous and time-consuming processes, including higher rates of detailed rejection paths and longer execution times for both rejection and success paths. This indicates potential unfair treatment or additional barriers for the protected group compared to the unprotected group.
