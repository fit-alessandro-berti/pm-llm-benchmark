Okay, here's a textual BPMN-like process model based on the provided interview excerpts, designed to be convertible into a visual BPMN diagram.

---

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process

**Pools/Lanes (Roles/Systems):**
*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk** (Mary)
*   **Purchasing Officer** (Dan)
*   **Department Manager** (Carlos)
*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Supervisor** (Rita)
*   **Supplier** (External)
*   **Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)** (Karen) - *Note: Acts as a support role, may not need a dedicated lane if tasks are primarily communication initiated by others.*
*   **Accounting System** (System)

---

**Process Flow:**

1.  **Start Event:** Invoice Received
    *   **Trigger:** Invoice arrives (usually by email).
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk

2.  **Task:** Receive Invoice
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Input Artifact:** Invoice (Email)

3.  **Exclusive Gateway (XOR): PO Exists on Invoice?**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Condition:** Check if invoice has a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.

    *   **Path 1: No PO**
        *   **Task:** Request PO/Details from Supplier
            *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
            *   **Output Artifact:** Email to Supplier
            *   **Note:** Karen (SRM) might be involved if the supplier needs direct contact: "If the invoice is missing the PO number, I ask them to provide it or send a revised invoice." (This is an alternative/support path, not the primary AP Clerk action).
        *   **End Event (Sub-process):** Invoice Awaiting PO/Rejected (temporarily)
            *   *The process might loop back to "Receive Invoice" if a revised invoice with PO is sent, or terminate if no PO is forthcoming.*

    *   **Path 2: PO Exists**
        *   **Task:** Log Invoice in System
            *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
            *   **System:** Accounting System
            *   **Output Artifact:** Logged Invoice (in system)

        *   **Task:** Forward Invoice for Goods/Services Receipt Confirmation
            *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
            *   **Recipient:** Purchasing Officer
            *   **Output Artifact:** Invoice (forwarded, likely via system or email)

4.  **Task:** Check Goods/Services Receipt & PO Alignment
    *   **Actor:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)
    *   **Input Artifact:** Invoice, Purchase Order (PO)
    *   **Activity:** Compare invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) with PO.

5.  **Exclusive Gateway (XOR): Goods/Services Confirmed & PO Aligns?**
    *   **Actor:** Purchasing Officer

    *   **Path 1: Discrepancy Found (Purchasing)**
        *   **Exclusive Gateway (XOR): How to Handle Purchasing Discrepancy?**
            *   **Actor:** Purchasing Officer
            *   **Option A:**
                *   **Task:** Contact Supplier Directly for Correction
                    *   **Actor:** Purchasing Officer (potentially with SRM support: Karen)
                    *   **Note:** Awaits corrected invoice or resolution. May loop back to "Receive Invoice" if a new invoice is issued, or continue if resolution is simpler.
                *   **(Implicit) End Event (Sub-process):** Awaiting Supplier Correction

            *   **Option B:**
                *   **Task:** Request AP Clerk to Hold Invoice
                    *   **Actor:** Purchasing Officer
                    *   **Recipient:** AP Clerk
                    *   **Note:** Awaits corrected version from supplier via AP Clerk.

            *   **Option C (from Mary, for AP-identified issues, but could apply if Purchasing informs AP):**
                *   **Task:** Email Purchasing Team to Clarify (if discrepancy first noted by AP, but Purchasing needs to investigate)
                    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
                    *   **Recipient:** Purchasing Officer
                    *   *(This path might loop back to Purchasing Officer's "Check Goods/Services Receipt" task after clarification)*

        *   **Task (Escalation from AP Clerk, if Purchasing cannot resolve or if AP initiated discrepancy):** Escalate to AP Supervisor
            *   **Actor:** AP Clerk (if initial discrepancy was hers, or if Purchasing Officer returns it unresolved)
            *   **Recipient:** AP Supervisor (Rita)
            *   **Trigger:** Discrepancy cannot be easily resolved by AP Clerk or Purchasing.
            *   **Leads to:** Exception Handling Sub-Process (see below)

    *   **Path 2: Goods/Services Confirmed & PO Aligns (Purchasing)**
        *   **Task:** Send Confirmation to AP
            *   **Actor:** Purchasing Officer
            *   **Recipient:** AP Clerk
            *   **Output Artifact:** Confirmation Email/Notification

6.  **Task:** Receive Confirmation from Purchasing
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Input Artifact:** Confirmation Email/Notification

7.  **Task:** Match Invoice Line Items with PO (in System)
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **System:** Accounting System
    *   **Input Artifacts:** Logged Invoice, PO, Purchasing Confirmation

8.  **Exclusive Gateway (XOR): Invoice Matches PO?**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk

    *   **Path 1: Discrepancy Found (AP after Purchasing Confirmation)**
        *   **Task:** Email Purchasing Team to Clarify
            *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
            *   **Recipient:** Purchasing Officer
            *   *(This path would likely loop back to Purchasing Officer's "Check Goods/Services Receipt" or a new clarification task for Purchasing, then back to AP Clerk's "Match Invoice Line Items")*
        *   **Exclusive Gateway (XOR): Discrepancy Resolvable by AP/Purchasing?**
            *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
            *   **Path A: Resolvable (after clarification loop):**
                *   *Flow continues to "Invoice Matches PO" positive path.*
            *   **Path B: Not Easily Resolvable:**
                *   **Task:** Escalate to AP Supervisor
                    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
                    *   **Recipient:** AP Supervisor (Rita)
                    *   **Leads to:** Exception Handling Sub-Process (see below)

    *   **Path 2: Invoice Matches PO**
        *   **(Implicit Parallel Join - AND Gateway):** Both "Goods/Services Confirmed by Purchasing" AND "Invoice Matches PO by AP" must be true.
        *   **Task:** Trigger Manager Approval
            *   **Actor:** AP Clerk / System
            *   **System:** Accounting System (sends automatic email/notification)
            *   **Recipient:** Department Manager
            *   **Output Artifact:** Approval Request (with Invoice, PO, Confirmation details)

9.  **Task:** Review Invoice for Approval
    *   **Actor:** Department Manager (Carlos)
    *   **Input Artifact:** Approval Request (Invoice, PO, Confirmation)

10. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR): Approve Invoice?**
    *   **Actor:** Department Manager

    *   **Path 1: Suspicious / Reject / Investigate Further**
        *   **Task:** Reject Invoice OR Request Hold & Further Investigation
            *   **Actor:** Department Manager
            *   **Recipient (for hold/investigation):** AP Clerk (Mary)
            *   **Note:** If rejected, process may end or be routed to AP Supervisor. If "hold & investigate," AP Clerk or Supervisor might initiate further actions (potentially looping into Exception Handling).
        *   **(Implicit) End Event (Sub-process):** Invoice Rejected/On Hold

    *   **Path 2: Approve**
        *   **Task:** Approve Invoice in System

    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **System:** Accounting System

13. **End Event:** Invoice Scheduled for Payment

**Exception Handling Sub-Process (Initiated by Escalation to AP Supervisor):**

E1. **Start Event (Exception):** Escalation Received by AP Supervisor
    *   **Actor:** AP Supervisor (Rita)
    *   **Trigger:** Escalation from AP Clerk (due to PO matching issues, Purchasing unresolved issues, or invoices without POs for informal services).

E2. **Task:** Investigate Escalated Issue
    *   **Actor:** AP Supervisor
    *   **Activities may include:**
        *   Contacting Suppliers (potentially with SRM support - Karen)
        *   Coordinating between departments (AP, Purchasing)
        *   Working with department heads (for retrospective POs)

E3. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR): Nature of Exception?**
    *   **Actor:** AP Supervisor

    *   **Path A: Missing PO (Informal Service)**
        *   **Task:** Work with Department Head for Resolution
            *   **Actor:** AP Supervisor, Department Head
        *   **Exclusive Gateway (XOR): Resolution for Missing PO?**
            *   **Actor:** AP Supervisor, Department Head
            *   **Option 1: Create Retrospective PO**
                *   **Task:** Create Retrospective PO
                    *   **Actor:** Department Head / Purchasing (as per internal procedure)
                    *   *Flow re-joins main process at a suitable point, e.g., AP Clerk's "Log Invoice" or "Forward to Purchasing" after PO is available.*
            *   **Option 2: Reject Invoice**
                *   **Task:** Reject Invoice
                    *   **Actor:** AP Supervisor / Department Head
                *   **End Event (Exception Sub-process):** Invoice Rejected

    *   **Path B: Discrepancy (Price, Quantity, etc.)**
        *   **Task:** Resolve Discrepancy
            *   **Actor:** AP Supervisor (may involve AP Clerk, Purchasing, SRM)
            *   **Note:** This might involve supplier communication, contract checks (SRM).
        *   **Exclusive Gateway (XOR): Discrepancy Resolved?**
            *   **Actor:** AP Supervisor
            *   **Option 1: Resolved**
                *   *Flow re-joins main process. Rita: "After we clear up these exceptions, the invoice goes back into the normal flow: confirmation from Purchasing, approval by the Manager, then scheduling for payment." This suggests re-entry before "Send Confirmation to AP" by Purchasing if Purchasing's input is still needed, or before "Trigger Manager Approval" if Purchasing part is done.*
                *   **Intermediate Event:** Issue Resolved
                *   **Sequence Flow:** To appropriate re-entry point in main process (e.g., step 6 "Receive Confirmation from Purchasing" if Purchasing needs to re-confirm, or step 8's positive path "Invoice Matches PO" if AP can now confirm match, then to step 8.Path2 "Trigger Manager Approval").

            *   **Option 2: Unresolved / Reject**
                *   **Task:** Reject Invoice
                    *   **Actor:** AP Supervisor
                *   **End Event (Exception Sub-process):** Invoice Rejected

E4. **End Event (Exception Sub-process):** Exception Processed (either resolved and re-joined, or invoice rejected).

---

**Key Artifacts Mentioned:**
*   Invoice (Email, System Record)
*   Purchase Order (PO)
*   Confirmation Email/Notification (from Purchasing to AP)
*   Approval Request (to Manager)
*   Logged Invoice (in Accounting System)
*   Approved Invoice (in Accounting System)

**Uncertainties/Consolidations:**
*   The exact re-entry point after Rita (AP Supervisor) resolves an exception needs to be precise for BPMN. It seems to depend on what was resolved. If a PO was missing and is now added, it might go back to AP logging. If a discrepancy that Purchasing flagged is resolved, it might go back for Purchasing to confirm, then AP to match. If an AP-flagged matching issue is resolved, it might go to manager approval. The model assumes re-entry before manager approval, potentially after Purchasing's re-confirmation if needed.
*   Dan (Purchasing) mentions "contact the supplier directly OR ask the Accounts Payable clerk to hold the invoice." This is represented as an XOR gateway.
*   Karen (SRM) is a support role; her tasks are usually communications to help AP/Purchasing. She doesn't seem to have her own distinct, sequential tasks in the core flow but is called upon during exception handling or clarification.
