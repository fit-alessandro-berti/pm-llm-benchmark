Below is a consolidated event log that follows the instructions given.  
• Case ID = order_id  
• One row = one event (34 events in total)  
• Events are listed in chronological order inside every case so the entire table can be sorted on the two keys (Case ID, Timestamp) without losing the correct sequence.  
• Resource names were looked-up in the “Resources” table; when no clear human actor exists, a generic role was used.  
• Extra information that might be useful for process mining (item, quantity, delivery / invoice / payment IDs, amounts, etc.) is placed in the “Attributes” column.

Assumptions  
1. “Payment Received” is executed by an automated payment interface, therefore Resource = “Payment Gateway”.  
2. Orders without deliveries / invoices (order 1004) are still “open”; only the events present in the raw data are shown.  
3. Timezone is kept exactly as provided (all timestamps already include the trailing “Z”).
