### Merged Event Log

Below is the integrated event log, merging corresponding events from **Log A** and **Log B** based on `order_id`, event timing (with a tolerance of 2 seconds), and contextual event name mapping. Unmatched events are included as-is, with their source indicated.

#### **Final Integrated Log (Chronological Order):**
| timestamp_A          | timestamp_B          | event_type         | order_id    | user_id | resource_id | notes                          | source |

### **Reasoning for Merging Decisions**

#### **1. Event Matching Criteria**
- **Order ID**: All events share `Order#1234`, so alignment relied on timing and event semantics.
- **Timestamp Tolerance**: Used **2 seconds** (inclusive) for matching. This accounts for:
  - System clock drifts.
  - Different granularities (e.g., Log A timestamps reflect event *receipt* time).
  - Requirement note: "slightly offset by a few seconds."
- **Event Name Mapping**: Mapped events based on contextual similarity:
  | Log A Event         | Log B Event         | Rationale                                                                 |
  |---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Order Received      | OrderReceived       | Identical semantic meaning; timestamp diff = **2s** (within tolerance).   |
  | Order Validated     | OrderValidation     | Semantic match; timestamp diff = **1s** (within tolerance).              |
  | Payment Processed   | PaymentCheck        | Both relate to payment; timestamp diff = **5s** (exceeds tolerance).      |
  | Item Shipped        | Shipping            | Semantic match; timestamp diff = **2s** (within tolerance).               |
  | Item Delivered      | *(None)*            | No equivalent in Log B.                                                   |
  | *(None)*            | Quality Check       | No equivalent in Log A.                                                   |

#### **2. Merged Events (3 matches)**
- **Order Received** (A) + **OrderReceived** (B):
  - **Timestamps**: Used `timestamp_A` (10:00:00Z) as primary (Log A is primary timeline), but retained both.
  - **Attributes**: Combined `user_id`, `resource_id`, and `notes` from Log B.
  - **Why merged?** Timestamp difference (2s) is within tolerance; event names are semantically identical.
  
- **Order Validated** (A) + **OrderValidation** (B):
  - **Timestamps**: Used `timestamp_A` (10:01:30Z) as primary; difference (1s) is negligible.
  - **Attributes**: Added Log B’s `user_id`, `resource_id`, and `notes`.
  - **Why merged?** Timestamp difference (1s) is within tolerance; event names clearly map.

- **Item Shipped** (A) + **Shipping** (B):
  - **Timestamps**: Used `timestamp_A` (10:05:00Z) as primary; difference (2s) is within tolerance.
  - **Attributes**: Enriched with Log B’s `user_id`, `resource_id`, and `notes`.
  - **Why merged?** Timestamp difference (2s) is within tolerance; "Shipping" is synonymous with "Item Shipped."

#### **3. Unmatched Events (4 events)**
- **Payment Processed** (A only):
  - **Reason**: Log B’s `PaymentCheck` occurs **5s later** (10:02:05Z vs. 10:02:00Z), exceeding tolerance. Despite semantic similarity, the gap suggests they represent distinct moments (e.g., Log B’s note "Payment gateway delay" explains the delay).
  - **Handling**: Included as-is with `source = "A"`.

- **PaymentCheck** (B only):
  - **Reason**: Timestamp gap (5s) with Log A’s `Payment Processed` is too large. Log B’s unique metadata (`resource_id = r99`, note) further differentiates it.
  - **Handling**: Included as-is with `source = "B"`.

- **Quality Check** (B only):
  - **Reason**: No equivalent event in Log A. Occurs between `PaymentCheck` and `Shipping` in Log B.
  - **Handling**: Included as-is with `source = "B"`.

- **Item Delivered** (A only):
  - **Reason**: No corresponding event in Log B (Log B ends at "Shipping").
  - **Handling**: Included as-is with `source = "A"`.

#### **4. Timestamp Handling**
- **Primary Timestamp for Sorting**: Used `timestamp_A` for merged/Log A events and `timestamp_B` for Log B-only events. This ensures:
  - Log A’s primary timeline drives chronological order.
  - Log B-only events use their native timestamps when Log A data is absent.
- **Conflict Resolution**: For merged events, both timestamps are retained to preserve auditability. `timestamp_A` is prioritized for sorting as Log A is the primary system.

#### **5. Attribute Integration**
- **Merged Events**: All attributes from both logs are included (e.g., `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes` from Log B).
- **Unmatched Events**: Attributes from the source log are preserved; nulls fill missing fields (e.g., `user_id` is `null` for Log A-only events).
- **Source Field**: Added to indicate origin (`A`, `B`, or `A+B`).

### **Key Insights**
- **Tolerance Justification**: A **2s** tolerance balanced strictness with real-world variability (e.g., network delays, clock skew). Including 2s captured obvious matches (e.g., `Order Received`/`OrderReceived`).
- **Semantic Mapping**: Event names were mapped contextually (e.g., `Shipping`  `Item Shipped`), not just syntactically.
- **Enrichment**: Log B’s richer attributes (e.g., `user_id`, `notes`) enhanced merged events without losing Log A’s core data.
- **Gaps Explained**: Unmatched events like `Quality Check` (Log B) highlight process differences between systems (e.g., System B performs extra inspections).

This integration provides a unified, enriched timeline while preserving the integrity of both source logs.
