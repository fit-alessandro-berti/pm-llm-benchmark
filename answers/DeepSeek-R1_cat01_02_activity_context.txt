**Justification for Renaming:**

1. **C001: "Verify Documents" → "Initial Document Verification" and "Additional Document Verification"**  
   - The first occurrence is the **initial check** of identity documents.  
   - The second occurs after the customer submits additional documents, making it a **re-verification** of new information.  

2. **C002: "Call Customer" → "Clarification Call" and "Confirmation Call"**  
   - The first call resolves an **account discrepancy** (clarification).  
   - The second confirms that **adjustments were completed** (confirmation).  

3. **C003: "Verify Documents" → "Physical Document Verification" and "Post-Adjustment Document Verification"**  
   - The first verification is **physical** (branch walk-in).  
   - The second occurs after an **internal account adjustment**, requiring re-verification of documents.  

**Notes:**  
- Activities like "Call Customer" in C003 were not renamed because they occur only once in the case.  
- "Adjust Account" remains unchanged as it is contextually clear and not duplicated within a single case.  
- Names emphasize **sequence** (initial/additional), **purpose** (clarification/confirmation), or **trigger** (physical/post-adjustment).
