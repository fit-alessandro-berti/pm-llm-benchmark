A concise way to capture “RA  VF  AE  (zero or more RMI+VF)  AD  SC  AC” is the following processtree (in functional notation):

->(  
  “RA”,  
  “VF”,  
  “AE”,  
  * (  
    ,  
    ->( “RMI”, “VF” )  
  ),  
  “AD”,  
  “SC”,  
  “AC”  
)

Explanation of the operators:

• ->( … ) is a (possibly nary) sequence.  
• * (A, B) is the loop: first A is executed, then either you exit, or you execute B and then A again, etc.  
•  is a silent step. By choosing A= we allow zero or more executions of B without forcing any visible action on loopentry.  
• B = ->( “RMI”, “VF” ) is the little subprocess “Request Missing Info  Validate Form” that may repeat.

Thus the model reads:

1. Receive Application  
2. Validate Form  
3. Assess Eligibility  
4. loop {    [exit]    “RMI  VF”    … }  
   – i.e. zero or more times do “Request Missing Info” then “Validate Form”
