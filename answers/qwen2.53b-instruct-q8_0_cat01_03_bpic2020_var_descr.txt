Certainly! The provided data describes a series of processes with different variations, each varying in terms of who approves or rejects specific steps and which step is handled at the end (Request Payment -> Payment Handled). Let's break down the process flow based on these variants.

### Basic Process Outline:
1. **Declaration Submitted by EMPLOYEE**: The process starts here.
2. **Approval Steps**:
   - Can be approved by ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, or SUPERVISOR
3. **Final Approval Step**:
   - Must be finalized by the SUPERVISOR (Final_Approved).
4. **Payment Request & Handling**:
   - After Final Approval, a request for payment is made.
5. **Completion of Payment Handled**: The process ends with "Payment Handled".

### Process Variations:
Let's analyze each variation:

### Summary:
The primary process consists of the basic flow with varying approval steps and a final approval by the SUPERVISOR. The additional approvals (by BUDGET OWNER or PRE_APPROVER) add complexity to each step, while some variations involve loops or immediate rejections at earlier stages.

This detailed breakdown provides insights into how different approvals can alter processing times and frequencies.
