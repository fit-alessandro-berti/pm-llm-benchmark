Based on the provided data, it appears we have a workflow or approval process for some kind of declaration that needs to be handled by multiple levels before final approval can be given and payment processed. The key participants in this process include:

1. **Employee**: The entity which initially submits the declaration.
2. **Pre-approver**: An intermediate approver who has initial review over the declaration, either directly or through some hierarchy (e.g., ADMINISTRATION).
3. **Administrator/Supervisor/Budget Owner**: Higher-level approvers responsible for final approval.
4. **Missing**: A possible entity that could be a level of final verification or oversight.

The process can be summarized as follows:

### Initial Submission
- The declaration is submitted by an Employee initially.

### Approval Process
1. **Approval through Pre-approver**:
   - If the initial submission passes, it goes to the Pre-Approver for approval.
   - This step can also involve a series of approvals: APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION (or BUDGET OWNER) depending on the process.

2. **Approval through Admin/Super**:
   - If the declaration is approved at this stage, it goes to the Supervisor for final approval.
     - The Supervisor either approves or rejects the request based on their decision.
     - In some scenarios, the rejection by the Supervisors leads back to the Employee for a further submission.

3. **Final Approval and Payment Handling**:
   - If the declaration passes through all the intermediate levels (Employee -> Pre-approver -> Admin/Super), it reaches the final approval from the Supervisor.
   - Upon receiving this final approval, a Request for Payment is made which leads to the handling of payment.

### Potential Cycles and Backtracking
- There are instances where the process gets stuck in loops or cycles:
  - For example, if the declaration fails at any point (approval or rejection), it might be re-submitted back through various steps.
  
### Performance Metrics
The data also includes frequency and performance metrics which could help in understanding the throughput of these processes. 

### Summary Process
1. Employee submits initial declaration.
2. Declaration goes to Pre-approver for approval.
3. Depending on whether or not it is approved, it moves through higher levels:
   - If approved by Pre-approvers, then Admin/Super are involved.
4. Final decision from the Supervisor (approval/rejection).
5. Based on final approval, a Request for Payment is made and processed.

This process can be highly iterative depending on approvals or rejections at various checkpoints. The performance metrics show how frequently each step in this workflow occurs and what overall time these transactions take.
