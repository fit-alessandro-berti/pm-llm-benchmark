Assumptions
- Case ID is order_id.
- Each order line becomes an “Item Picked” event (one per line) with picker as resource and item attributes from Products.
- Each delivery record yields two events: “Order Dispatched” and “Order Arrived,” resource = carrier.
- Each invoice yields “Invoice Issued,” resource = billing clerk.
- Each payment yields “Payment Received,” resource = payment_method (as actor not in Resources table) and linked invoice_id/reference.
- Orders without downstream records simply end with available events.
- Timestamps are used as-is; order of events is determined by timestamp. If equal timestamps occur, order is as listed below.

Notes
- No delivery or invoicing/payment records exist for order 1004 beyond picking; it appears undelivered/uninvoiced as of data end.
- Two-part delivery and invoicing for order 1002 are modeled as separate events, preserving partial shipment and billing behavior.
- Resource names and roles are resolved from the Resources table; for payments, payment_method is used as the actor since payer identity is not provided.
