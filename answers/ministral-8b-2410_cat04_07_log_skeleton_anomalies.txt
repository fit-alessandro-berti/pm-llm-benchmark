Based on the provided declarative constraints, here are some potential anomalies in the proposed process model:

1. **Activity Occurrences Anomalies:**
   - For `Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`: The activity can have occurrences 0, 1, 2, 3. However, in the constraints, there are no activities that can directly follow `Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER` more than once, which contradicts the declared activity occurrences.
   - For `Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`: The activity can have occurrences 0, 1, 2, 3, 6. There's no clear reason for allowing this activity to have 6 occurrences, which could lead to confusion or errors in the process model.

2. **Directly-Follows Constraints Anomalies:**
   - For `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, the directly-follows constraint is `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'`. However, this does not align with the Always Before constraint `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'`, which suggests that `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` should be an indirect outcome of `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, not `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`.
   - For `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`, the directly-follows constraint is `'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'`. However, this does not align with the Never Together constraint `'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'`, which suggests that these two activities cannot co-exist.

3. **Inconsistent Constraints:**
   - The Always After constraint `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'` contradicts the Always Before constraint `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'`. It's unclear whether `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING` should be a direct outcome or an indirect outcome of `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`.
   - The Always Before constraint `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'` contradicts the Always After constraint `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'`. It's unclear whether `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` should be a direct outcome or an indirect outcome of `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`.

These anomalies suggest inconsistencies or errors in the process model. It would be helpful to review and clarify these constraints to ensure a coherent and consistent process model.
