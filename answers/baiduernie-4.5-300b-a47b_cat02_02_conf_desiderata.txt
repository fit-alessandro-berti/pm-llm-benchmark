### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**  
The normative rules strictly define the required sequence and conditions for the loan application process. Violations occur if:  
- Steps are skipped or reordered.  
- Documentation is finalized after a rejection.  
- The case is closed without adhering to the decision logic (approved  finalize docs before closing; rejected  close without finalization).  

#### **Case ID 2: Normative Violations**  
1. **Violation**: **Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check**  
   - **Explanation**: The sequence requires `Credit Check  Risk Assessment`, but in Case 2, `Risk Assessment` occurs at `2024-01-11 08:20` **before** the `Credit Check` at `2024-01-11 09:00`.  
   - **Rule Broken**: "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."  

2. **Violation**: **Finalize Documentation performed after a rejection**  
   - **Explanation**: The loan decision was `Rejected` at `2024-01-11 09:30`, but `Finalize Documentation` occurred at `2024-01-11 10:00` **before closing the case**.  
   - **Rule Broken**: "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."  

#### **Other Cases (1 & 3)**  
- **Case 1**: Adheres to **all normative rules**.  
- **Case 3**: Adheres to **all normative rules** (no skipped steps, correct order, no forbidden actions).

### **2. Cases Failing Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**  
Desiderata are recommended best practices, not strict requirements. Failures here are suboptimal but not violations.  

#### **Case ID 3: Desiderata Violations**  
1. **Violation**: **Credit Check performed more than 24 hours after Application Received**  
   - **Recommendation**: "Credit Check should ideally be completed within 24 hours of Application Received."  
   - **Observation**: Application Received at `2024-01-12 09:00`, Credit Check at `2024-01-14 10:00` (~49 hours later).  

2. **Violation**: **Applicant informed more than 48 hours after Loan Decision**  
   - **Recommendation**: "Applicant should be informed within 48 hours of Loan Decision."  
   - **Observation**: Loan Decision (Approved) at `2024-01-14 12:00`, Inform Applicant at `2024-01-16 15:00` (~51 hours later).  

3. **Violation**: **No Follow-up Call before closing the case**  
   - **Recommendation**: "A Follow-up Call is encouraged before closing the case."  
   - **Observation**: Case 3 has no Follow-up Call event.  

#### **Other Cases (1 & 2)**  
- **Case 1**: Meets **all desiderata**.  
- **Case 2**: No desiderata violations (but has normative violations).

### **3. Interpretations/Justifications for Observed Behaviors**  
#### **Normative Violations (Case 2)**  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**:  
  - Possible explanation: A systemic error or misconfiguration in the workflow system allowed `Risk Assessment` to proceed without waiting for the `Credit Check`.  
  - Correction: The process should enforce dependencies (e.g., disable `Risk Assessment` button until `Credit Check` is complete).  

- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**:  
  - Possible explanation: A manual override or miscommunication led to documentation finalization despite the rejection.  
  - Correction: Automate decision checks (e.g., if decision = "Rejected," disable "Finalize Documentation" button).  

#### **Desiderata Violations (Case 3)**  
- **Delayed Credit Check**:  
  - Possible explanation: Resource constraints (e.g., understaffed credit department over the weekend).  
  - Recommendation: Allocate priority resources to time-sensitive tasks or automate reminders.  

- **Delayed Applicant Notification**:  
  - Possible explanation: High workload or backlog in the communication team.  
  - Recommendation: Automate notifications or set internal SLAs with escalation protocols.  

- **No Follow-up Call**:  
  - Possible explanation: The Follow-up Call is not mandated, so it may have been omitted due to time constraints or perceived redundancy.  
  - Recommendation: Re-evaluate the value of the Follow-up Call; if beneficial, enforce it as a best practice.  

### **Summary of Findings**  
- **Normative Violations**: Only Case 2 violates strict rules.  
- **Desiderata Violations**: Only Case 3 fails recommended best practices.  
- **Improvement Areas**:  
  - Case 2: Fix process dependencies and post-rejection restrictions.  
  - Case 3: Improve turnaround times and consider automating communication.
