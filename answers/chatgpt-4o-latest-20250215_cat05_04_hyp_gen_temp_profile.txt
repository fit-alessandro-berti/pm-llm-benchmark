### **Detected Anomalies in Temporal Profile**  

1. **Unusually Low Variability in Receive â†’ Approve (`R â†’ P`)**  
   - The process moves from claim reception to approval in about **25 hours** with a **very low standard deviation (1 hour)**.  
   - This suggests a rigid, automated approval schedule or a systematic fast-tracking of claims.  

2. **Extensive Delay in Approve â†’ Notify (`P â†’ N`)**  
   - The **7-day average** gap with a **large standard deviation (2 days)** suggests inconsistent processing.  
   - Possible causes include manual delays, backlog issues, or dependent processes delaying notifications.  

3. **Rapid Closure After Assignment (`A â†’ C`)**  
   - The **2-hour average** suggests some claims are closed almost immediately after assignment, skipping expected intermediate steps.  
   - This could indicate premature closures due to misclassification, automation errors, or fraudulent activity.  

4. **Too Fast Transition from Evaluate â†’ Notify (`E â†’ N`)**  
   - Only **5 minutes** on average between evaluation and notification is unrealistic for proper claim assessment.  
   - This could suggest an automated system overriding manual checks, or adjusters rubber-stamping evaluations.

### **Potential Hypotheses for These Anomalies**  

1. **Automated Approval System Bypassing Normal Processing (`R â†’ P`)**  
   - Certain claim types might be pre-approved without detailed evaluation, explaining the rigid approval timing.  

2. **Delayed Customer Communication (`P â†’ N`)**  
   - Some notifications might require external verification, legal checks, or dependent actions that delay messaging.  

3. **Premature Closures (`A â†’ C`)**  
   - Certain adjusters or claim types may be bypassing the full claims process due to auto-closure logic or operational shortcuts.  

4. **Skipped Evaluation Steps (`E â†’ N`)**  
   - Evaluation might be a mere formality for some claim types, or batch processing might trigger near-instant notifications.

### **SQL Queries for Verification**  

#### **1. Detect Claims with Fixed-Timing Approvals (`R â†’ P`)**  
```sql
SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - 
                           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) AS time_to_approve
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - 
                                  MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END)))) < 3600;  -- Low variance threshold
```
*Finds claims where approval timing is highly predictable, suggesting automation.*  

#### **2. Identify Claims with Excessive Approval â†’ Notification Delays (`P â†’ N`)**  
```sql
SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - 
                           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) AS time_to_notify
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING time_to_notify > 604800;  -- Over 7 days
```
*Identifies claims where notification is significantly delayed after approval.*  

#### **3. Check for Immediate Closures After Assignment (`A â†’ C`)**  
```sql
SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - 
                           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))) AS time_to_close
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING time_to_close < 7200;  -- Less than 2 hours
```
*Flags claims that were closed suspiciously fast after assignment.*  

#### **4. Find Claims Where Evaluation and Notification Happen Too Quickly (`E â†’ N`)**  
```sql
SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - 
                           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END))) AS time_to_notify
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING time_to_notify < 300;  -- Less than 5 minutes
```
*Detects cases where evaluation immediately triggers a notification, suggesting automation.*

### **Next Steps for Investigation**  

- **Check if specific adjusters or claim types correlate with these anomalies:**  
  ```sql
  SELECT ce.claim_id, a.name, c.claim_type, 
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                             MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END))) AS time_to_approve
  FROM claim_events ce
  JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
  GROUP BY ce.claim_id, a.name, c.claim_type
  HAVING time_to_approve < 90000;  -- Approvals within 25 hours
  ```
  *Determines whether specific adjusters or claim types exhibit faster-than-expected approval times.*  

- **Investigate possible automation in the claims process:**  
  - Are there system-generated timestamps close together?  
  - Are manual entries showing different timing distributions?  

- **Correlate long notification delays with external dependencies:**  
  - Do delays align with third-party involvement or regional trends?  

By running these SQL queries and analyses, we can pinpoint process inefficiencies, potential fraud, or automation errors in the insurance claims workflow. ðŸš€
