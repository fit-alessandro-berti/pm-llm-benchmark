Here’s a possible Log Skeleton for the described order-fulfillment process, encoded as a Python dictionary.  It assumes each activity occurs exactly once per case and strictly follows the linear order stated, with key equivalences where counts must match:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # Activities whose occurrence counts must be equal
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'D'),    # one Receive Order  one Dispatch
        ('CA', 'RI'),   # one Check Availability  one Reserve Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),   # one Pick Items        one Quality Check
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # one Pack Order        one Generate Shipping Label
        ('IC', 'RP')    # one Invoice Customer  one Record Payment
    },

    # If the first activity occurs, the second must have occurred sometime before
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),
        ('RI', 'CA'),
        ('PI', 'RI'),
        ('QC', 'PI'),
        ('PO', 'QC'),
        ('GSL', 'PO'),
        ('D',  'GSL'),
        ('IC', 'D'),
        ('RP', 'IC')
    },

    # If the first activity occurs, the second must occur sometime after
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL','D'),
        ('D',  'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    },

    # No mutually exclusive activities in this strictly linear scenario
    'never_together': set(),

    # Each activity must occur exactly once per case
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D':  {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {1}
    },

    # Directly-follows pairs: each step immediately succeeds its predecessor
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D',  'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    }
}
```

Explanation of each key:

- **equivalence**  
  Ensures that for every order processed, the paired activities occur the same number of times (e.g. you can’t pack without generating a label, invoice without recording payment, etc.).

- **always_before** / **always_after**  
  Capture the causal ordering: e.g. you can’t pick items (PI) unless you’ve reserved them (RI) beforehand, and once you pick them, you must eventually quality-check them.

- **never_together**  
  Empty here, since all activities are part of the single, linear happy-path.

- **activ_freq**  
  Bounds each activity to occur exactly once per case.

- **directly_follows**  
  Enforces the strict sequence: each activity immediately follows its predecessor in the process.
