The process described in the data appears to be a business process for handling declarations and related payment requests in an organization. Here's a breakdown of the steps and actors involved:

**Main Process**

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED**: An employee submits a declaration, which is the starting point for the process.
2. **Declaration APPROVED**: The declaration is reviewed and approved by the Administration, marked by "ADMINISTRATION".
3. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED**: The approved declaration is reviewed and finalized by the Supervisor, marked by "SUPERVISOR".

**Decision Point - Payment Request**

After the declaration is approved, the process proceeds to a decision point where a payment request is generated.

**Branching Paths**

However, there are various branching paths that diverge from the main process path, representing different scenarios where the approval process is interrupted or requires additional reviews:

1. **Rejection by Administration**: If the declaration is rejected by the Administration, it is sent back to the Employee for correction or revision.
2. **Rejection by Supervisor**: If the declaration is rejected by the Supervisor, it is sent back to the Employee for correction or revision.
3. **Rejection by Budget Owner**: If the declaration is rejected by the Budget Owner (in parallel with the Administration), it is sent back to the Employee for correction or revision.
4. **Rejection by Pre-Approver**: In some cases, the declaration is reviewed and approved by a Pre-Approver before reaching the Administration.

**Decision Points - Payment or Return to Submitter**

Depending on the path taken, the process may either proceed to request payment or send the declaration back to the submitter (Employee) for correction or revision:

1. **Request Payment**: After the declaration is finalized, a payment request is generated, leading to the final outcome of Payment Handled.
2. **Return to Submitter**: If the declaration is rejected or requires additional reviews, it is sent back to the Employee for correction or revision.

**Starting Points and Ending Points**

The process starts with a declaration submitted by an Employee and ends with Payment Handled or various intermediate outcomes, depending on the path taken.

**Actors Involved**

Key actors involved in the process are:

1. **Employee**: Submits declarations and corrects revisions as needed.
2. **Administration**: Reviews and approves declarations.
3. **Supervisor**: Reviews and finalizes approved declarations.
4. **Budget Owner**: Reviews and approves declarations (in parallel with the Administration).
5. **Pre-Approver**: Reviews and approves declarations (in certain cases).
