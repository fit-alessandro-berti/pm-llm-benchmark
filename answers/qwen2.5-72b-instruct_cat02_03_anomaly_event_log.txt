### Analysis of Anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Event Log

#### Case 1001
- **Standard Sequence**: Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Purchase Requisition  Issue Purchase Order  Receive Goods  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case
- **Anomalies**: None. The sequence follows the standard P2P process flow and all activities are in the correct order.

#### Case 1002

- **Anomalies**:
  - **Issue Purchase Order before Approve Purchase Requisition**: The purchase order was issued before the purchase requisition was approved. This is a significant anomaly because it violates the standard practice of requiring approval before issuing a purchase order. This can lead to unauthorized spending and potential financial discrepancies.
  - **Release Payment before Receive Goods and Match Invoice to PO**: The payment was released before the goods were received and the invoice was matched to the purchase order. This is highly problematic because it increases the risk of fraud and financial loss. The company should not release payment until it has verified that the goods have been received and the invoice matches the purchase order.

#### Case 1003
- **Standard Sequence**: Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Purchase Requisition  Issue Purchase Order  Receive Goods  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case
- **Anomalies**:
  - **Release Payment before Vendor Invoice Received and Receive Goods**: The payment was released before the vendor invoice was received and the goods were received. This is a significant anomaly because it increases the risk of paying for goods that were never delivered or for which the invoice is incorrect. This can lead to financial loss and operational inefficiencies.
  - **Match Invoice to PO after Release Payment**: The invoice was matched to the purchase order after the payment was released. This is problematic because it means the company did not verify the accuracy of the invoice before making the payment, which can lead to overpayments or payments for incorrect amounts.

This can lead to discrepancies in inventory and financial records.
