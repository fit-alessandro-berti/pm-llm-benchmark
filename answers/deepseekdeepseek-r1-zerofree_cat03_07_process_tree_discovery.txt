To discover a process tree from the given event log, we need to analyze the given event log and identify the main flow and the optional part where a "Request Missing Info (RMI)" activity might be repeated until the form is validated ("Validate Form (VF)").

Let us first analyze the event log provided:

1. **Case ID 1:**
   - The sequence is: `RA -> VF -> AE -> RMI -> VF -> AD -> SC -> AC`.
   - After "Assess Eligibility (AE)", there is a "Request Missing Info (RMI)" followed by another "Validate Form (VF)".
   - After the second "Validate Form (VF)", the process proceeds with "Approval Decision (AD)", "Send Confirmation (SC)", and "Archive Case (AC)".

2. **Case ID 2:**
   - The sequence is: `RA -> VF -> AE -> AD -> SC -> AC`.
   - After "Assess Eligibility (AE)", there is no "Request Missing Info (RMI)", and the process continues directly to "Approval Decision (AD)".

3. **Case ID 3:**
   - The sequence is: `RA -> VF -> AE -> RMI -> RMI -> VF -> AD -> SC -> AC`.
   - After "Assess Eligibility (AE)", there are two "Request Missing Info (RMI)" activities followed by another "Validate Form (VF)".

Based on these three cases, it appears that the main flow is:
1. `Receive Application (RA)`
2. `Validate Form (VF)`
3. `Assess Eligibility (AE)`
4. `Approval Decision (AD)`
5. `Send Confirmation (SC)`
6. `Archive Case (AC)`

However, after "Assess Eligibility (AE)", there might be a loop where "Request Missing Info (RMI)" can happen one or more times until "Validate Form (VF)" is called again. Once validated, the process proceeds to "Approval Decision (AD)".

The main part of the process seems to be a sequence until "Assess Eligibility (AE)", where there is a choice between directly going to "Approval Decision (AD)" or entering a loop where "Request Missing Info (RMI)" can be repeated until "Validate Form (VF)" is executed again. The main part after "Assess Eligibility (AE)" thus seems like a loop where the loop body could be:
1. `Request Missing Info (RMI)`, which could be repeated until the next step which is always a "Validate Form (VF)".

However, a common structure for such a part could be modeled as a loop where once "Assess Eligibility (AE)" is executed, the process could either:
1. Proceed directly to "Approval Decision (AD)", or
2. Loop back through a sequence of `RMI -> VF` until it is decided that no more "Request Missing Info (RMI)" is needed and the process proceeds to "Approval Decision (AD)".

However, a loop structure in a process tree is defined as `* ( A, B )`, which means that `A` is executed first. If the loop is not exited, `B` is executed, followed by executing `A` again until the loop is exited where we proceed with whatever comes after the loop in the main process. 

Based on this, a part that seems to be a candidate for a loop could be the part after "Assess Eligibility (AE)" until "Approval Decision (AD)".

However, another important part is that the "Request Missing Info (RMI)" might be followed by another "Validate Form (VF)".

Another part that seems important here is that once "Request Missing Info (RMI)" is done, the process needs to validate the form again ("Validate Form (VF)") before making an "Approval Decision (AD)".

However, an alternative way to structure this could be:
1. A sequence until "Assess Eligibility (AE)" which is `-> ( -> ( -> ( 'RA', 'VF' ), 'AE' ), ... )`.
2. After "Assess Eligibility (AE)", there is a choice where either:
   - The process goes straight to "Approval Decision (AD)".
   - The process enters a loop where "Request Missing Info (RMI)" is followed by "Validate Form (VF)"; this loop could repeat until the form is valid and the process exits the loop and proceeds to "Approval Decision (AD)".

Based on this, a possible structure might be:
1. `-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', [where there is a choice between a loop or directly proceeding to 'AD'] )`
2. After "AE", there should be a part where we either:
   - Directly go to "AD" (exclusive choice between the loop or "tau" (silent step) which directly leads to "AD").
   - Enter a loop where `A` would be "RMI" and `B` would be "VF". The loop could be structured as `* ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) )` where the first part of the loop is a silent step (tau) which makes it so that the loop can be directly exited if no "RMI" is needed. 
3. After the part that follows "AE", the process should continue with a sequence: `-> ( 'AD', 'SC', 'AC')`.

So a candidate process tree might be structured as:
```
-> ( 'RA',
    -> ( 'VF',
        -> ( 'AE',
            -> ( XOR (
                    * ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ),
                    'tau'
                ),
                -> ( 'AD',
                    -> ( 'SC',
                        'AC'
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

However, the question here is to make sure that the process tree makes sense. Another way to interpret the part after "AE" could be:
1. An exclusive choice between `tau` (directly go to "AD") or `-> ( 'RMI', 'VF' )`, which could be repeated until the loop is exited.
2. Once the choice is made and the loop (if entered) is exited, the process should continue with "AD", "SC", and "AC".

Based on this, a more structured way could be:
1. `-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', loop_or_tau, 'AD', 'SC', 'AC')` where `loop_or_tau` is a part which could be a loop where the loop part is `* ( A, B )` where `A` is `tau` (which makes it possible to exit the loop) and `B` is `-> ( 'RMI', 'VF' )`.

However, a "loop" operator should have a structure such that `A` is executed first and then either exit the loop or execute `B` followed by `A` again until the loop is exited. Thus, a valid part of the process tree could be:
```
-> ( 'RA',
    -> ( 'VF',
        -> ( 'AE',
            -> (* ( 'tau',
                    -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' )
                  ),
                -> ( 'AD',
                    -> ( 'SC',
                        'AC'
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

However, a more structured "loop" part looks like:
```
* ( A, B )
```
Where `A` is executed first and `B` is executed if the loop is not exited yet until `A` is executed again.

However, another way to make a more clear process tree could be:
1. `-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE' )` (mandatory part until "AE").
2. After "AE", it could be `-> ( loop_part, 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )` where `loop_part` is either a loop or a silent step (tau) if no `RMI` is needed.
3. `loop_part` could be `* ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) )`, which means:
   - First, you check if you should exit the loop (tau step).
   - If not, you execute `-> ( 'RMI', 'VF' )` which means `RMI` followed by `VF` and you return to check if the loop should be exited again.

Based on this reasoning, a possible process tree could be:
```
-> ( 'RA',
    -> ( 'VF',
        -> ( 'AE',
            -> ( * ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ),
                -> ( 'AD',
                    -> ( 'SC',
                        'AC'
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

However, this process tree makes sure that after "AE," if "RMI" is needed, it is followed by "VF," and the process can either exit the loop (if no "RMI" is needed) or execute "RMI" followed by "VF" until the loop is exited where the process continues with "AD," "SC," and "AC."

This reasoning makes a case for a process tree that looks like:
```
-> ( 'RA',
    -> ( 'VF',
        -> ( 'AE',
            -> ( * ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ),
                'AD',
                'SC',
                'AC'
            )
        )
    )
)
```

However, a more organized way to structure the reasoning could be:
1. `'RA'` should go first.
2. Followed by `'VF'`.
3. Followed by `'AE'`.
4. After `'AE'`, there is a loop where:
   - If no "RMI" is needed, exit the loop and go to `'AD'` (this requires a `tau`).
   - If "RMI" is needed, execute `'RMI'` followed by `'VF'` (which might need to be validated again), until one exits the loop and proceeds to `'AD'`.
5. After `'AD'`, follow with `'SC'`.
6. Finally, end with `'AC'`.

Based on the reasoning, the process tree should follow the sequence `-> ( RA, VF, AE, [loop], AD, SC, AC )`. The part where `[loop]` is placed should be:
- `* ( tau, -> ( RMI, VF ) )`.

However, if `->` is used for a sequence of more than two elements (as `-> ( A, B, C )` should be interpreted as `-> ( A, -> ( B, C ) )`), a more valid tree might thus be:
$$
-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', * ( \tau, -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )
$$
This translates to:
$$
-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', -> ( * ( \tau, -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), -> ( 'AD', -> ( 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) ) ) )
$$
However, the part `-> ( 'AE', -> ( * ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), -> ( 'AD', -> ( 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) )` needs to make sure that the part after "AE" is a single block where:
1. The process might need to request missing info multiple times (until a valid form is received).
2. Once the loop is exited, it should go straight to "AD," followed by "SC" and "AC."

Let us check if the provided log traces are valid for this process tree:
- For Case ID 1 (`RA -> VF -> AE -> RMI -> VF -> AD -> SC -> AC`), the loop part `* ( tau, -> ( RMI, VF ) )` allows for one round of `RMI -> VF` and then exits the loop (since `tau` makes it possible to exit the loop right after `AE` but here it goes once through `RMI -> VF`).
- For Case ID 2 (`RA -> VF -> AE -> AD -> SC -> AC`), the `tau` part makes it so that the process exits the loop right after `AE` and goes straight to `AD -> SC -> AC`.
- For Case ID 3 (`RA -> VF -> AE -> RMI -> RMI -> VF -> AD -> SC -> AC`), the `* ( tau, -> ( RMI, VF ) )` part should allow `RMI -> RMI -> VF` (which might need a bit of a different structure or a more explicit loop handling, but here it seems `RMI` should be always followed by `VF`).

However, from the process tree structure `* ( tau, -> ( RMI, VF ) )`, the "tau" part makes it possible to exit the loop immediately after `AE` if no `RMI` is needed. However, the structure `-> ( RMI, VF )` should be executed if the loop is not exited after `tau`. 

However, the log shows `RMI` can be executed multiple times until `VF` follows. Thus, `* ( tau, -> ( RMI, VF ) )` seems like a valid part of the tree where:
1. `tau` makes it possible to exit the loop and go directly to `AD -> SC -> AC`.
2. Otherwise, `RMI -> VF` is executed until the loop is exited where the process proceeds to `AD -> SC -> AC`.

Based on this reasoning, the process tree should be:
$$
-> ( 'RA',
    -> ( 'VF',
        -> ( 'AE',
            -> ( * ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ),
                -> ( 'AD',
                    -> ( 'SC',
                        'AC'
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
$$
This makes sense because:
1. `* ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) )` allows for a choice between directly going to `'AD'` or iterating through `'RMI'` and `'VF'`.

Thus, a well-defined process tree that makes sense could be:
$$
\text{-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', -> ( * ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), -> ( 'AD', -> ( 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) ) ) )}
$$
This makes the main part a sequence where the part after `'AE'` is a loop `* ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) )`, which if exited leads to `'AD' -> 'SC' -> 'AC'`.

A more human-readable process tree could be:
$$
-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', -> ( * ( -> ( 'tau', 'tau' ), -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) )
$$
However, `* ( -> ( 'tau', 'tau' ), -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) )` might need a more thorough check.

However, another valid form to make sure that `RMI` is followed by `VF` and can be repeated until `AD` should be:
$$
-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', * ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )
$$
However, what makes sense here might be:
$$
-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', * ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )
$$
Here is a "pseudocode" representation of what seems a valid process tree:
$$
-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', * ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )
$$
However, a "->" relation needs only two children, thus:
$$
-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', -> ( * ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), -> ( 'AD', -> ( 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) ) ) )
$$
Thus, the process tree can be constructed as follows:
1. `-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', 'AE', LOOP, 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' ) )` where LOOP is `* ( tau, -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) )`.

Based on the question statement, a valid process tree can be written in a string format such that:
```
->('RA',->('VF',->('AE',->(*(tau,->('RMI','VF')),->('AD',->('SC','AC'))))))
```

However, a better string representation should be:
```
-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', -> ( * ( tau, -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), -> ( 'AD', -> ( 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) ) ) )
```

Thus, the "final" process tree could be structured such that the main part is a sequence where:
1. `Receive Application (RA)` is first.
2. Followed by `Validate Form (VF)`.
3. Followed by `Assess Eligibility (AE)`.
4. After `AE`, there is a loop where you either exit immediately (via `tau`) or you do `Request Missing Info (RMI)` followed by `Validate Form (VF)`, until you exit the loop.
5. After the loop, `Approval Decision (AD)`, `Send Confirmation (SC)`, and `Archive Case (AC)` follow sequentially.

This makes sense based on the given event log. An alternative check could be done by explicitly verifying the trace against the process tree to make sure that all cases follow the described structure.
