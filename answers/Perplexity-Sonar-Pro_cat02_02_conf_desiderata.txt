Based on the provided event log and the normative process behavior rules, I'll analyze each case:

1. Identifying normative rule violations:

Case 1:
- No violations of normative rules. All activities follow the correct sequence.

Case 2:
- Violates normative rules in two ways:
  1. Risk Assessment is performed before Credit Check, violating the required sequence.
  2. Finalize Documentation is performed after a loan rejection, which is not allowed.

Case 3:
- No violations of normative rules. All activities follow the correct sequence.

2. Identifying failures to meet desiderata conditions:

Case 1:
- Meets all desiderata conditions. Credit check is done promptly, and the applicant is informed quickly.

Case 2:
- Due to the normative violations, desiderata conditions are not applicable.

Case 3:
- Credit Check is performed more than 24 hours after Application Received, failing to meet the recommended timing.
- Inform Applicant occurs more than 48 hours after Loan Decision, missing the prompt notification recommendation.
- No Follow-up Call is recorded, missing this recommended (but not required) step.

While these deviations in Case 3 are not severe violations, they represent suboptimal behavior according to the recommended best practices.

3. Interpretations and justifications:

Case 1:
- This case follows both normative rules and desiderata perfectly, representing ideal process execution.

Case 2:
- The reversal of Credit Check and Risk Assessment could indicate a misunderstanding of the process or a system error.
- Finalizing documentation after rejection might suggest a training issue or confusion about the correct procedure for rejected applications.

Case 3:
- The delay in Credit Check could be due to a backlog of applications or staff shortages.
- The late applicant notification might result from a communication breakdown or heavy workload.
- The missing Follow-up Call, while not a severe issue, might indicate that the process was rushed or that this step is often overlooked.

In summary, Case 1 adheres to all rules and recommendations, Case 2 has serious normative violations that need to be addressed, and Case 3 follows the required sequence but falls short on some recommended practices, indicating areas for potential process improvement.
