# Integration of Event Logs A and B

Below is the **merged event log** produced from integrating Log A (System A) and Log B (System B), along with detailed reasoning for each step.

### **Merged Event Log**

For each matching event (based on `order_id` and timestamp), combined attributes were used when both logs provided them; otherwise, data from the originating log was preserved (or marked accordingly if multiple logs provided options).

| Timestamp          | Source / Event Name            | Order # | User ID | Resource ID | Notes                                                   | Event Type (Primary) |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z | OrderReceived                   | 1234    | -       | -           | Event captured at warehouse system                       | Order Received        |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z | OrderValidation                 | 1234    | u12     | r10         | Cross-check inventory                                   | Order Validation      |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z | Order Validated                 | 1234    | u12     | r10         | (Merged from A's "Order Validated" role)                 | Order Validated      |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z | Payment Processed               | 1234    | u12     | r99         | Payment gateway delay                                    | Payment Processed    |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z | Quality Check                   | 1234    | u45     | r11         | Random inspection                                        | Quality Check        |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z | Quality Assurance               | 1234    | u45     | r11         | (Merged event name, e.g., "Inspection" vs "Quality Check")| Quality Assurance (Extracted)|
| **2023-10-10T10:05:00Z** | Item Shipped                    | 1234    | u45     | r10         | (Re-organized to align with payment/payment-related event)| Item Shipped         |
| **2023-10-10T10:05:02Z** | Shipping                        | 1234    | u45     | r10         | Package handed to courier (appended below Payment)       | Shipping             |

### **Alignment & Merging Logic Explained**

#### **1. Initial Parsing**
- Log A uses **Event Type + Order ID** with a simpler timestamp format.
- Log B uses **Event Name + Event Type + Order ID + user_id + resource_id (etc.)** with richer timestamps.
- Both logs describe the same order (`Order#1234`).

#### **2. Matching Events by `order_id`**
For each `Order#1234`, events were matched using a tolerance between timestamps of up to **2 seconds**, as per the instruction.

| Log A (Source)           | Time      | Event Type/Label         | Reason for Matching | Notes                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A, 10:00:00, `Order Received` | 10:00:00  | Order Received            | Matched to Log B's 09:59:58 (within ±2s tolerance) | Log B: event arbitrarily earlier, assumed delay/offset; merged as same-order activation |
| A, 10:01:30, `Order Validated` | 10:01:30  | Order Validation        | Matched directly since no conflicting event in B; merged attributes                     |
| A, 10:02:00, `Payment Processed` | 10:02:00  | Payment Processed       | Matched directly; minor delay from B’s event                                           |
| A, 10:02:05, `Payment Check` | 10:02:05  | Payment Check           | Unique event in A — confirmed distinct cycle                                            | • Originates from Log A; included separately |
| A, 10:03:00, `Quality Check` | 10:03:00  | Quality Check            | Matched directly; arises directly from B’s "Quality Check" if not renamed        |
| A, 10:05:00, `Item Shipped` | 10:05:00  | Item Shipped             | Split into two events (see below)                                                     |
| A, 10:05:02, `Item Delivered` | 10:05:02  | Item Delivered           | Matched directly                                                                      |

#### **3. Timezone Consistency**
All timestamps are converted to the same format (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`) for consistency.

#### **4. Handling Timestamp Tolerance**
- Log A timestamps are seen to reflect **incoming event times**, so early by ~58s from Log B’s timing.  
   If aligned cross-system with timing rules (e.g., attempt to pair Log A's 10:00:00 with Log B’s 09:59:58 within tolerance),  
  but unique "Order Validation" in Log A was treated as distinct due to different event naming and role — no rubber-ducking of timestamps alone just cause merging.

#### **5. Resolving Naming Variations**
- Similar events had the same action but different naming:
  - `Order Validation` (A) merged with log B’s `Cross-check inventory` (interpreted as equivalent activity). **Reason**: Semantically equivalent in context of order fulfillment. To avoid overconfidence, used longest matching label `Order Validation` (in Log A) to describe this event itself, but grouped by context in merged records.
  - Event later named `Quality Assurance` after unification appears to be **Quality Check** in B. This was automatically grouped by same `order_id` and original event logic.
  
- Verified that `PaymentProcessed` in Log A is distinct and non-duplicate in B; `Payment Check` in Log A is separate but in B considered a payment-specific activity, so no merge conflict.

#### **6. Unique Events**
- All cases: no exact duplicates except a timeline of valid events.

#### **7. Attribute Enrichment**
All attributes are **merged**:
- Log A: `timestamp`, event type, order ID  
- Log B: adds `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes`  
- For events from a double log source (except duplicates), merged set is taken. Single-log events retained only if relevant.

#### **8. Chronological Order**
Events re-ordered based on:
- Primary merge timebase — effectively adjusted from Log A’s first occurrences to align with the later Log B timeline for cross-system consistency check, but **final output sorted by cohesive chronology**, not inclusive of arbitrary system time precision.  
- Final list ordered meaningfully in **event sequence**, as shown above.

---

### **Summary of Handling Decisions:**

- Event names **regarded as descriptions** and grouped if semantically equivalent; event **types still tracked separately initially**.
- Timestamp differences < 2s  matched. Others, especially if nearly overlapping (Log A 10:00:00 vs Log B 10:00:00:58), only merged if event logic or source confirmed equivalence.  
- Sparse Log A events (e.g., `OrderReceived` earlier in day) assumed valid preemption based on order context and no conflicting matchup; included as-is with origin attribution to avoid loss of early-stage activity.
- Aspects of Log B’s richer data **automatically merged syntactically** into Log A’s sparse event stream to build a complete log.

### **Final Output (Formatted List)**

1. **2023-10-10T09:59:58Z**, Order Received, Order#1234  
   *(From Log B; aligns with early ops)*  

2. **2023-10-10T10:01:29Z**, Order Validation, Order#1234, u12,r10 – **Order Validation** *(Exclusive label from A identifying equivalent process)*  

3. **2023-10-10T10:02:00Z**, Payment Processed, Order#1234, u12,r99  – **Payment Processed** *(Unique to A; new event)*  

4. **2023-10-10T10:02:05Z**, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45,r11 – **Quality Check** *(Log B’s internal name, merged contextual understanding)*  

5. **2023-10-10T10:05:00Z**, Item Shipped, Order#1234, u45,r10, **Notes: (from A's branch: Package handed to courier – but re-motivated to align with B's event)**  *Justified re-augmentation from log A branch logic as Item Shipped, not contradicted by B’s Shipping*  
   *(Note to exclude redundant Shipping event unless needed — this is Item Shipped directly)*

6. **2023-10-10T10:05:02Z**, Shipping, Order#1234, u45,r10 – **Shipping** *(Space later added after Item Shipped to clarify sequence)*   # **Note**: Item Shipped (A branch) and Shipping (B branch) treated separately to preserve distinct actions.

This integration ensures a **unified, enriched view** of the order fulfillment lifecycle, combining **limited but clean Log A** with **rich but broad Log B** while resolving ambiguities through naming and logical context.
