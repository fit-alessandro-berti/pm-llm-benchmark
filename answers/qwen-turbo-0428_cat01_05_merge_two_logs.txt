### **Reasoning & Conflict Resolution**  

#### **Matching Events**  
1. **"Order Received" (Log A)  "OrderReceived" (Log B)**  
   - **Timestamps**: 10:00:00Z (Log A) vs. 09:59:58Z (Log B)  **2-second difference** (within tolerance).  
   - **Action**: Merged. Log A's timestamp used as primary (per Log A's role as the primary timeline).  
   - **Attributes**: Combined all fields (event type, event name, user ID, resource ID, notes).  

2. **"Order Validated" (Log A)  "OrderValidation" (Log B)**  
   - **Timestamps**: 10:01:30Z (Log A) vs. 10:01:29Z (Log B)  **1-second difference** (within tolerance).  
   - **Action**: Merged. Log A's timestamp retained.  
   - **Attributes**: Combined all fields.  

3. **"Item Shipped" (Log A)  "Shipping" (Log B)**  
   - **Timestamps**: 10:05:00Z (Log A) vs. 10:05:02Z (Log B)  **2-second difference** (within tolerance).  
   - **Action**: Merged. Log A's timestamp retained.  
   - **Attributes**: Combined all fields.  

#### **Non-Matching Events**  
4. **"Payment Processed" (Log A)**  
   - No matching event in Log B (Log B's "PaymentCheck" at 10:02:05Z is **5 seconds later**, exceeding the 2-second tolerance).  
   - **Action**: Included as standalone in Log A.  

5. **"PaymentCheck" (Log B)**  
   - No matching event in Log A.  
   - **Action**: Included as standalone in Log B.  

6. **"Quality Check" (Log B)**  
   - No matching event in Log A.  
   - **Action**: Included as standalone in Log B.  

7. **"Item Delivered" (Log A)**  
   - No matching event in Log B.  
   - **Action**: Included as standalone in Log A.

### **Key Decisions**  
- **Timestamp Priority**: Log A's timestamps were used as the primary for chronological ordering, as per the problem's instruction that Log A is the "primary" timeline.  
- **Attribute Merging**: All attributes from both logs were preserved in merged events. For example, Log B's `user_id`, `resource_id`, and `notes` were added to the merged records.  
- **Conflict Handling**: When timestamps differed slightly, the 2-second tolerance was applied. If no match was found, events were left separate.  
- **Event Naming**: Event types from Log A were retained (e.g., "Order Received") for consistency, while Log B's event names (e.g., "OrderReceived") were included as additional metadata.  

---

### **Final Notes**  
- The merged log reflects the full lifecycle of the order, combining both systems' data.  
- Events with no matches (e.g., "PaymentCheck", "Quality Check") are explicitly marked with their origin (Log B) to avoid ambiguity.  
- The final order adheres to Log A's timeline, ensuring alignment with the primary system's perspective.
