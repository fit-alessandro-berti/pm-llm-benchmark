Certainly! Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),
valid_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM
        case_event_counts
    WHERE
        event_count <= 6
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
JOIN
    valid_cases vc
ON
    el.case_id = vc.case_id
;
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `case_event_counts` CTE computes the total number of events (`event_count`) per `case_id`.
2. The `valid_cases` CTE filters to only those `case_id`s with six or fewer events.
3. The final `SELECT` retrieves all events from `event_log` where the `case_id` is in the set of valid cases, effectively filtering out cases with more than six events.

Feel free to adapt the column names if your schema differs!
