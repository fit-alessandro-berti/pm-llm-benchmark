Okay, here's a textual, BPMN-like process model based on the provided interview transcripts, capturing the key elements:

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process

**Start Event:** Invoice Arrives (typically via email)

**Activity:** Check for Purchase Order (PO)
    * **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
    * **Output:** (Implicit) PO status
    * **Sequence Flow:**
        * **[Conditional]** If PO is present: proceed to "Log Invoice"
        * **[Conditional]** If PO is missing: proceed to "Request PO from Supplier"

**Activity:** Request PO from Supplier
    * **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
    * **Output:** Request for PO details
    * **Sequence Flow:** Back to Start Event (Waiting for resubmission of invoice) - *Note: implicitly restarts flow after receiving PO details.*

**Activity:** Log Invoice
    * **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
    * **Input:** Invoice with valid PO
    * **Output:** Invoice Logged in System
    * **Sequence Flow:** To "Forward Invoice to Purchasing"

**Activity:** Forward Invoice to Purchasing
    * **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
    * **Output:** (Implicit) Invoice sent to Purchasing
    * **Sequence Flow:** To "Verify Invoice Details"

**Activity:** Verify Invoice Details
    * **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)
    * **Input:** Invoice with PO
    * **Output:** (Implicit) Confirmation or discrepancy noted
    * **Sequence Flow:**
         * **[Conditional]** If Invoice Details Match PO: proceed to "Confirm Invoice"
         * **[Conditional]** If Invoice Details Do Not Match PO: proceed to "Resolve Discrepancy (Purchasing)"

**Activity:** Resolve Discrepancy (Purchasing)
    * **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan), (Possibly Supplier Relationship Manager - Karen)
    * **Input:** Invoice with Discrepancy
    * **Output:** Clarified Invoice
    * **Sequence Flow:**
         * **[Conditional]** If Discrepancy resolved with supplier: Return to "Verify Invoice Details"
         * **[Conditional]** If Discrepancy needs escalation: To "Escalate Invoice Issue"

**Activity:** Confirm Invoice
    * **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)
    * **Output:** Confirmation of Invoice Details
    * **Sequence Flow:** To "Forward Invoice to Department Manager"

**Activity:** Forward Invoice to Department Manager
   * **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   * **Input:** Invoice confirmed by Purchasing
   * **Output:** (Implicit) Notification to Department Manager
   * **Sequence Flow:** To "Approve Invoice"

**Activity:** Approve Invoice
    * **Role:** Department Manager (Carlos)
    * **Input:** Invoice Details, PO, and Purchasing Confirmation
    * **Output:** Approval decision
    * **Sequence Flow:**
         * **[Conditional]** If Invoice Approved: proceed to "Schedule Payment"
         * **[Conditional]** If Invoice Rejected: proceed to "Re-evaluate Invoice (Manager)"

**Activity:** Re-evaluate Invoice (Manager)
    * **Role:** Department Manager (Carlos)
    * **Output:** Clarification Request
    * **Sequence Flow:** To "Resolve Discrepancy (Manager)"

**Activity:** Resolve Discrepancy (Manager)
   * **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), (Possibly Supplier Relationship Manager - Karen)
   * **Input:** Invoice with Manager Discrepancy
   * **Output:** Clarified Invoice or Decision
   * **Sequence Flow:**
         * **[Conditional]** If Discrepancy resolved: Return to "Verify Invoice Details"
         * **[Conditional]** If Decision is to Reject: Terminate Process *Note: Not a typical flow - requires further handling of rejected invoices but not within the scope of this process.*

**Activity:** Schedule Payment
    * **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
    * **Input:** Approved Invoice
    * **Output:** Invoice scheduled for payment
    * **Sequence Flow:** To "End Event"

**Activity:** Escalate Invoice Issue
    * **Role:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
    * **Input:** Invoice with complex discrepancy or missing PO (exception case)
    * **Output:** (Implicit) Resolution plan
    * **Sequence Flow:**
      * **[Conditional]** If issue resolved with Supplier (e.g. missing PO provided): Return to Start event
      * **[Conditional]** If PO needs to be created retrospectively: Return to "Verify Invoice Details"
      * **[Conditional]** If issue can't be resolved: To "Reject Invoice" *Note: Not a typical flow - requires further handling of rejected invoices but not within the scope of this process.*

**End Event:** Invoice Payment Scheduled

**Notes on Ambiguities/Inconsistencies:**

*   The precise handoff points are sometimes implicit in the narratives. E.g., it's not always stated explicitly how Mary "sends" the invoice; its more inferred by role activity.
*   The exact mechanism for escalating issues to Rita (the Supervisor) isn’t explicitly stated.
*   The handling of rejected invoices or those without valid POs that require special handling is a side-flow not fully addressed and needs further investigation of how these are processed
*   The loop back to start is implicitly understood when issues with an invoice are detected.

This textual description is designed to be clear and structured, allowing for easy conversion into a visual BPMN diagram while also highlighting potential areas that require further clarification or process improvement.
