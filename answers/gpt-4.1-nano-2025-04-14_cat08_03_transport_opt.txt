**Comprehensive Approach to Process Mining and Optimization for Speedy Parcels**

---

### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

#### Data Preprocessing and Integration

- **Data Collection & Sources:**
  - *GPS Data:* Timestamps, location coordinates, speed, vehicle status.
  - *Scanner Data:* Key milestones, timestamps, package IDs, locations.
  - *Dispatch Data:* Planned routes, package assignments, customer time windows.
  - *Maintenance Logs:* Vehicle repair times, types, durations.

- **Integration Steps:**
  - **Identify Event Keys:** Use event timestamps, vehicle IDs, driver IDs, and package IDs to link events across systems.
  - **Timestamp Synchronization:** Convert all timestamps to a consistent time zone and format. Address clock skews or offsets.
  - **Case Identification:** Define a 'case' as a *vehicle's operational day* or *route*, dependent on context. For granular analysis, each package delivery can be a sub-case within the vehicle case.
  - **Event Labeling and Standardization:** Map various activities into standardized activities: 'Start Shift', 'Depart Depot', 'Arrive Customer', 'Delivery Success', 'Delivery Failed', 'Depart Customer', 'Arrive Depot', 'Maintenance Stop'.
  - **Handling Missing Data & Anomalies:** Filter out incomplete or inconsistent events, interpolate missing timestamps where feasible, and annotate anomalies for later analysis.

- **Challenges:**
  - *Data Quality and Consistency:* Disparate formats, missing data, or duplicate entries.
  - *Aligning Multiple Sources:* Cross-referencing events from GPS, scanners, and dispatch logs.
  - *Temporal Resolution:* Different event frequencies (e.g., GPS logs vs. manual scanner entries).

#### Process Discovery Algorithms

- Use algorithms like the *Alpha Miner*, *Heuristic Miner*, or *Inductive Miner* to generate process models that visualize the actual route sequences, including deviations.
  
- **Visualization Outputs:**
  - *Process Maps:* Show typical activity flows (e.g., Depot  Customer Stop  Next Stop  Depot).
  - *Variants:* Highlight different execution paths, especially those with frequent deviations or delays.
  - *Timing Analysis:* Overlay duration data to identify where processes are prolonged beyond planned times.

#### Conformance Checking

- **Compare Actual vs. Planned:**
  - Map the discovered process models against the planned routes from the dispatch system.
  - Identify **sequence deviations**容.g., routes differing from plans.
  - Detect **unplanned stops** such as traffic-related delays, unscheduled maintenance, or detours.
  - Analyze **timing deviations**容.g., actual travel or service times exceeding expectations, contributing to lateness.
  - Recognize **missing activities** like unexpected idling or re-routing.

- **Outcome:**
  - Quantify the frequency and impact of deviations.
  - Prioritize deviations that cause significant delays or cost increases.

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of packages delivered within specified time windows.
- **Average Time per Delivery:** Total active delivery time divided by number of deliveries.
- **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Measure how much time is spent driving vs. interacting with customers.
- **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Estimate from GPS speed profiles, correlating with fuel data if available.
- **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Percentage of shift time the vehicle is actively delivering vs. idle.
- **Traffic Delay Frequency/Duration:** Instances where GPS indicates low speed or stoppages outside planned stops.
- **Failed Delivery Rate:** Percentage of attempted deliveries that failed, requiring re-delivery.

#### Techniques for Bottleneck Identification

- **Process Mining Analysis:**
  - Use *Performance Mining* to overlay timing data on process models.
  - Identify *long waiting or dwell times* at customer locations用ossibly due to customer availability or inefficient procedures.
  - Detect recurrent *traffic-related delays* by correlating GPS speed drops with time-of-day or known congestion hotspots.
  - Analyze *sequence variants* to find routes with higher lateness or failed deliveries.
  - Use *Conformance Checking* to identify unplanned stops or route deviations that cause delays.
- **Quantification:**
  - Measure the impact of bottlenecks on average delivery times.
  - Trace bottleneck occurrences back to specific routes, drivers, times, or vehicle types.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

- **Potential Root Causes & Process Mining Insights:**

  | Root Cause                                              | How Process Mining Helps                                              |
  |----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | *Suboptimal route planning*                              | Variants with frequent deviations or re-routing; high dwell times. |
  | *Inaccurate travel time estimates*                      | Consistent delays despite planned schedules.                        |
  | *Traffic congestion patterns*                              | Annotate delays with external traffic data, correlate peak times.   |
  | *Variability in service time at customer locations*    | Variations in dwell time analysis; high variance at certain locations. |
  | *Vehicle breakdowns/unscheduled stops*                   | Maintenance logs aligned with interruption events; frequent unscheduled stops. |
  | *Driver behavior or skill differences*                    | Variant analysis distinguishing high vs. low performers; dwell times or delayed start times. |
  | *Failed deliveries requiring re-delivery*                | Revisit activity logs; identify cause patterns (e.g., customer unavailability).        |

- **Validation Approach:**
  - Compare high-performance routes/drivers with the underperformers.
  - Overlay external traffic data to see if delays coincide with congestion.
  - Assess if certain customers or time windows contribute disproportionately to delays.
