To identify the root causes of performance issues in the process, let's analyze the given directly follows graph data for each object type:

### Handling Unit
- **"Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck"**: The frequency of 10,553 events suggests this is a common and frequent step. The duration of 7,820.93 seconds (about 2.17 hours) per event might indicate slow processing or resource constraints.

### Truck
- **"Load Truck" -> "Load Truck"**: The frequency of 8,559 events and 6 unique objects suggest multiple trucks. However, the duration of 5,259.71 seconds indicates a relatively short time for loading compared to other steps.
- **"Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal"**: The frequency of 1,989 events and 6 unique objects suggest a relatively small batch, but the duration of 10,999.07 seconds (about 3.06 hours) is significantly longer than the loading duration.
- **"Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck"**: The frequency of 1,988 events and 6 unique objects suggests that the truck spends a considerable amount of time at the terminal (84,119.09 seconds, about 23.37 hours per event), which is a major performance bottleneck.

### Container
- **"Load Truck" -> "Load Truck"**: The frequency of 8,559 events and 1,896 unique objects (objects often refer to individual containers) indicates a large number of containers being loaded. The duration of 5,259.71 seconds is similar to that of "Truck" for loading, so this step is not the bottleneck.
- **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container"**: The frequency of 1,995 events and 1,995 unique objects suggests a potentially slow process (368,943.92 seconds, about 102.5 hours).
- **"Pick Up Empty Container" -> "Load Truck"**: The frequency of 1,994 events and 1,994 unique objects suggests a similarly slow process (38,659.62 seconds, about 10.74 hours).
- **"Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal"**: The frequency of 1,989 events and 1,989 unique objects suggests a parallel operation, but the duration of 10,999.07 seconds is also significant, similar to that of a truck.
- **"Drive to Terminal" -> "Weigh"**: The frequency of 1,989 events and 1,989 unique objects suggests a parallel operation, and the duration of 2,559.54 seconds (about 0.71 hours) is relatively short.
- **"Load to Vehicle" -> "Depart"**: The frequency of 1,956 events and 1,956 unique objects suggests a parallel operation, and the duration of 89,846.62 seconds (about 25.01 hours) is significantly longer.

### Root Causes
- **Handling Unit**: The loading step takes approximately 2.17 hours per event.
- **Truck**: The "Drive to Terminal" step involves an unusually long duration (84,119.09 seconds, about 23.37 hours per event).
- **Container**: The "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" (112,600.53 seconds, about 31.30 hours) and "Place in Stock" -> "Load to Vehicle" (128,603.05 seconds, about 35.73 hours) are particularly long.
- **Vehicle**: "Book Vehicles" -> "Reschedule Container" and "Book Vehicles" -> "Load to Vehicle" involve unusually long durations (372,476.42 and 283,101.01 seconds, about 103.47 and 78.64 hours, respectively).
- **Customer Order**: "Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document" has an unusually long duration (329,005.22 seconds, about 91.39 hours).
- **Transport Document**: "Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart" and "Depart" -> "Reschedule Container" involve unusually long durations (1,007,066.16 and 255,614.86 seconds, about 280.30 and 71.02 hours, respectively).

**Suggested Actions**:
1. **Optimize Truck Route Management**: Reduce the time spent at terminals.
2. **Improve Stock and Loading Operations**: Automate or better-coordinate stock picking and loading to reduce waiting and processing times.
3. **Enhance Booking and Rescheduling Processes**: Streamline booking and rescheduling to minimize delays.
4. **Improve Order Management**: Implement efficient order registration and document creation processes.
5. **Increase Automation**: Implement more automated systems to handle some of the manual tasks, reducing human error and processing time.

These actions should help identify and minimize the performance bottlenecks in the process.
