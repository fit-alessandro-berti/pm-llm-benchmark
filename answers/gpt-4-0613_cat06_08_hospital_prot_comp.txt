From examining the process variants of both the protected and unprotected group, several differences can be noted considering the order of operations, frequency, and performance. 

1. Order of Operations: There are noticeable inconsistencies in the order of operations (steps) taken in the process. For example, the unprotected group didn't have any process variant that only includes "Register at ER" or "Register at FD" like the protected group. This could suggest a premature end to the process for some individuals in the protected group.

2. Complexity: Some of the process variants for the unprotected group are more complicated than those for the protected group. For instance, some process variants in the unprotected group involve unsuccessful treatments followed by successful treatments. This might indicate that patients in the unprotected group are allowed or required to go through more stages in the process.

3. Treatment Success: The protected group has variants that end with unsuccessful treatment, whereas the unprotected group doesn't have variants ending in this way, showing that success rate of treatment varies between groups.

4. Frequency: Multiple processes occur more frequently in the unprotected group than the protected group. Specifically, the processes involving an 'Expert Examination' and 'Thorough Examination' stages seem to occur more often in the unprotected group.

5. Performance: The performance (execution time) also varies between the two groups. The process variants that involve 'Thorough Examination' have higher performance values for the unprotected group than the protected group. There could be many reasons for this, including different resources or staff allocated to each group, different complications in each group's cases, or biases in the system.

6. Discharge: There is a standalone process variant simply labeled “Discharge" in the unprotected group absent in the protected group. This could indicate that individuals in the unprotected group are being discharged without undergoing any other process steps. 

This analysis requires assumptions and domain knowledge about the hospital or healthcare system that these process steps are part of. Moreover, it indicates potential unfairness, but more in-depth analysis and understanding are required to definitively label any difference as unfair.
