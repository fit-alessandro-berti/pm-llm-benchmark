### Proposed High-Level Process Steps

| High-Level Step | Included Low-Level Activities | Rationale for Grouping |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| **1. Material Intake & Conditioning** | Retrieve raw metal sheet  Scan barcode  Place metal sheet on table  Align metal sheet  Preheat metal sheet | These actions transform a stock part into a work-ready blank. They are tightly clustered in time, handled by material-handling resources (Operator A, Robot Arm, Heating Unit), and all occur before any assembly work begins. They represent the material preparation phase. |
| **2. Welding Setup & Execution** | Pick up welding tool  Weld corner A  Weld corner B | This cluster includes the tool setup and actual joining operations performed by the welder. The same resource (Operator B) performs them in immediate sequence, and they collectively accomplish the structural assembly. |
| **3. In-line Weld Quality Verification** | Measure weld integrity | This measurement is a distinct control gate triggered right after welding, using a dedicated quality sensor. It ensures weld quality before further processing. |
| **4. Surface Protection & Curing** | Apply protective coating  Dry coating | Both tasks belong to the surface-finishing stage, handled by coating and heating units. They begin only when the weld passes inspection, and they prepare the part for final checks. |
| **5. Final Visual Release Check** | Visual check | The last confirmation step performed by Operator C prior to releasing the part. It is temporally separated from prior stages and serves as the final quality gate. |

### Grouping Logic Summary

1. **Temporal Proximity:** Events within each group occur consecutively with minimal gaps, indicating a cohesive operation.
2. **Resource Cohesion:** Groups often share resource types (e.g., Operator A for preparation, Operator B for welding, sensors for quality).
3. **Process Semantics:** Each group maps to a widely recognized manufacturing phase—preparation, assembly, inspection, finishing, final QC.
4. **Control Points:** Quality checks are isolated as separate high-level steps because they serve as decision gates before continuing the process.

These high-level activities provide a concise, domain-relevant macro view of the manufacturing workflow while preserving the essential sequencing of the original event log.
