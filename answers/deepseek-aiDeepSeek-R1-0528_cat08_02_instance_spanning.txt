We are given a scenario with an e-commerce fulfillment center and an event log. The challenges are due to instance-spanning constraints: shared cold-packing stations, batching for shipping, priority handling for express orders, and regulatory limits on hazardous materials. We must address each part of the task.

### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

**Approach using Process Mining:**
- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:** 
  - Use resource perspective: Group events by activity "Packing" and filter for cold-packing stations. Analyze waiting times between the end of the previous activity (e.g., Item Picking) and the start of packing when the station is cold-packing. Compare with standard packing.
  - Metrics: 
    - Average waiting time for cold-packing stations vs. standard.
    - Utilization of cold-packing stations (to see if they are bottlenecks).
    - Queue length at cold-packing stations (by counting orders waiting at any time).
- **Batching for Shipping:**
  - Identify orders that have completed "Quality Check" but are waiting for "Shipping Label Generation". The time between completion of Quality Check and start of Shipping Label Generation is the waiting time for batching.
  - Metrics:
    - Average waiting time for batching per order.
    - Distribution of batch sizes (by grouping orders by batch ID and destination region).
    - How long batches take to form (time from first order ready to batch completion).
- **Priority Handling:**
  - Analyze the effect of express orders on standard orders. For example, when an express order arrives at a resource (like packing station) and preempts a standard order, we can see the delay for the standard order by comparing the time it was paused (if logged) and resumed. If not directly logged, we might infer from the sequence and timestamps.
  - Metrics:
    - Increased waiting time for standard orders when an express order arrives.
    - Number of preemptions (if logged) or interruptions (inferred by a standard order having a long gap in processing when an express order uses the same resource).
- **Hazardous Material Limits:**
  - Count the number of orders with hazardous material that are in the "Packing" or "Quality Check" activities simultaneously. Check if there are periods when the count reaches 10 (the limit) and then orders must wait.
  - Metrics:
    - Waiting time for hazardous orders when the limit is reached.
    - Throughput of hazardous orders during peak times.

**Differentiating Waiting Times:**
- **Within-instance delays:** These are due to the order's own processing (e.g., long picking time because of many items). We can measure activity duration (from start to complete) and compare with historical averages for similar orders.
- **Between-instance delays:** These are due to shared resources, batching, or regulatory limits. We measure:
  - Time between the end of a preceding activity and the start of the next activity (if the resource is busy, then it's resource contention).
  - For batching: the time from when an order is ready for batching (end of Quality Check) until the batch is formed and processed.
  - For hazardous: when an order is ready for packing or quality check but cannot start because the limit is reached.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

**Potential Interactions:**
- **Express Order Needing Cold-Packing:** An express order requiring cold-packing might preempt a standard order using a cold-packing station. This causes:
  - The standard order is delayed (priority handling).
  - The cold-packing station is tied up by the express order, increasing the queue for cold-packing (shared resource).
- **Batching and Hazardous Materials:** If multiple hazardous orders are destined for the same region, they might be batched together. However, the regulatory limit (max 10 hazardous orders in packing/QC simultaneously) might force the batch to be split or cause waiting if the batch formation is delayed because some hazardous orders are still in packing/QC and the limit is reached.
- **Express Orders and Batching:** Express orders might be shipped immediately without batching, but if they are batched (e.g., with other express orders for the same region), then the batch formation time might be shorter because express orders are prioritized. However, if an express order is held for batching, it might defeat the purpose of express.

**Importance of Understanding Interactions:**
- Optimizing one constraint in isolation might worsen another. For example, increasing cold-packing stations might reduce waiting for cold-packing, but if express orders preempt frequently, standard orders might still suffer. Similarly, batching hazardous orders together might help with efficiency but could hit the regulatory limit. Therefore, strategies must be holistic.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing Stations**
- **Constraints Addressed:** Shared cold-packing stations and priority handling.
- **Changes:** Implement a dynamic policy where:
  - During peak times, convert some standard packing stations to cold-packing (if feasible by equipping them temporarily).
  - Use a priority queue for cold-packing: express orders go to the front, but also reserve one cold-packing station exclusively for express orders to avoid preemption (which causes standard order delays).
- **Data Leverage:** Use historical data to predict demand for cold-packing (by time of day, season). Forecast models can trigger station conversion. Also, monitor real-time queue lengths.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced waiting time for cold-packing, especially for express orders. Fewer preemptions of standard orders, leading to more predictable processing.

**Strategy 2: Smart Batching with Hazardous Material Awareness**
- **Constraints Addressed:** Batching and hazardous material limits.
- **Changes:** 
  - Modify batching logic: for hazardous orders, form smaller batches (or even ship individually) to avoid hitting the regulatory limit during packing/QC. 
  - For non-hazardous orders, use dynamic batch formation: trigger a batch when either a certain number of orders for a region are ready (e.g., 5) or a maximum waiting time (e.g., 15 minutes) is reached, whichever comes first.
- **Data Leverage:** Analyze historical data to find optimal batch sizes per region and time of day. Use real-time monitoring of hazardous orders in packing/QC to adjust batching.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced waiting time for batching, especially for non-hazardous orders. Avoid delays due to regulatory limits for hazardous orders.

**Strategy 3: Integrated Scheduling with Priority and Hazardous Constraints**
- **Constraints Addressed:** Priority handling, hazardous material limits, and resource contention.
- **Changes:**
  - Implement a scheduling system that:
    - Assigns start times for activities considering resource availability, order priority, and hazardous limits.
    - For hazardous orders, schedule packing/QC in a way that never exceeds 10. This might mean delaying the start of some hazardous orders until others finish.
    - For express orders, reserve resources in advance (if possible) to avoid preemption.
  - Additionally, consider minor process redesign: decouple the hazardous material handling by having a dedicated packing line for hazardous orders (if volume justifies) to isolate the regulatory constraint.
- **Data Leverage:** Use simulation (as in step 4) to test scheduling algorithms. Use historical data to train predictive models for activity durations and resource needs.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Better resource utilization, reduced waiting times for all orders, and compliance with hazardous limits without causing unnecessary delays.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

**Simulation Approach:**
- Build a discrete-event simulation model using the process model discovered from the event log, enriched with:
  - Resource pools (cold-packing stations, standard stations, QC staff) and their capacities.
  - Batching rules (for shipping) and batch formation triggers.
  - Priority rules (express orders can preempt, but we can also test without preemption).
  - Regulatory constraints (max 10 hazardous orders in packing/QC).
- Inputs: 
  - Process model (control flow) from process mining.
  - Activity durations and inter-arrival times from historical data.
  - Resource assignments and constraints.

**Focus for Accuracy:**
- **Resource Contention:** Model queues for each resource type (cold-packing, standard packing, QC) and implement priority queues for express orders.
- **Batching:** Model the batch formation process with parameters (max wait time, min batch size) and test different strategies.
- **Priority Interruptions:** Model preemption: when an express order arrives, it can interrupt a standard order, which then goes back to the queue.
- **Regulatory Limits:** Implement a counter for hazardous orders in packing and QC. When the counter is 10, new hazardous orders must wait until one finishes.

**Validation:**
- Run simulations for the current process and compare KPIs (throughput, average cycle time, resource utilization) with historical data to calibrate the model.
- Then, simulate the proposed strategies and compare KPIs. Focus on:
  - Average cycle time per order type (express vs. standard).
  - Waiting times at critical points (cold-packing, batching).
  - Hazardous material compliance (never exceed 10).

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

**Key Metrics and Dashboards:**
- **Metrics:**
  - Overall: Average cycle time, throughput (orders per hour).
  - Cold-Packing: Queue length, waiting time, utilization of stations.
  - Batching: Average waiting time for batching, batch size distribution.
  - Priority Handling: Average delay for standard orders due to preemption, on-time delivery rate for express orders.
  - Hazardous: Number of hazardous orders in packing/QC (must be <=10), waiting time for hazardous orders.

**Dashboards:**
  - Real-time view: Current queue lengths at cold-packing stations, current count of hazardous orders in packing/QC.
  - Historical trends: Cycle time by order type, waiting time for batching over time.
  - Alerts: When hazardous count reaches 8 (warning) or 10 (immediate action), when cold-packing queue exceeds a threshold.

**Tracking Constraint Management:**
  - **Shared Resources:** Reduced queue lengths and waiting times for cold-packing stations.
  - **Batching:** Shorter waiting times for batching and more consistent batch formation (e.g., 95% of batches formed within 10 minutes).
  - **Priority Handling:** High on-time rate for express orders without significantly increasing standard order cycle times.
  - **Hazardous Limits:** Always compliant, and waiting times for hazardous orders are within acceptable limits.

By following this structured approach, the fulfillment center can systematically address the instance-spanning constraints and improve performance.

### **1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**  
**Process Mining Techniques & Metrics:**  
- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:**  
  - **Technique:** Use *resource-centric analysis* (e.g., social network analysis) to map station usage. Calculate station utilization rates and waiting times via timestamps.  
  - **Metrics:**  
    - *Cold-packing queue length* (average orders waiting).  
    - *Cold-packing waiting time* (time from "Packing-ready" to "Packing-start" for cold orders).  
    - *Station utilization rate* (e.g., if stations are >90% busy, they are bottlenecks).  
  - **Differentiation:** Compare cold-packing vs. standard packing waiting times. If cold orders show high waiting times despite short activity durations, the delay is *between-instance* (resource contention).  

- **Shipping Batching:**  
  - **Technique:** Apply *batch detection algorithms* (e.g., clustering by destination region and batch ID) using timestamps.  
  - **Metrics:**  
    - *Batch formation delay* (time from "Quality Check-complete" to "Shipping Label-start").  
    - *Batch size distribution* (e.g., 40% of batches take >30 min to form).  
  - **Differentiation:** If an order’s "Quality Check-complete" to "Shipping Label-start" gap exceeds typical activity times, the delay is *between-instance* (waiting for batch peers).  

- **Priority Handling:**  
  - **Technique:** Use *conformance checking* to flag interruptions (e.g., a standard order’s "Packing" activity interrupted by an express order).  
  - **Metrics:**  
    - *Preemption frequency* (e.g., 20% of standard packing activities are paused).  
    - *Express-induced delay* (added waiting/processing time for standard  
  - **Differentiation:** If a standard order’s packing duration includes long pauses coinciding with express order starts, the delay is *between-instance*.  

- **Hazardous Material Limits:**  
  - **Technique:** *Temporal analysis* to count concurrent hazardous orders in "Packing" or "Quality Check" using overlapping timestamps.  
  - **Metrics:**  
    - *Hazardous throughput bottleneck* (orders delayed when concurrent count 10).  
    - *Compliance risk index* (% of time near/at limit).  
  - **Differentiation:** If hazardous orders have long waiting times only when concurrent orders 10, the delay is *between-instance*.  

**General Approach:**  
- Calculate *end-to-end time* and decompose delays using **performance spectrum analysis** to isolate *between-instance* waiting times. For example:  
  - *Within-instance delay* = Sum of activity durations.  
  - *Between-instance delay* = Total time minus within-instance delay.

### **2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions**  
**Key Interactions & Risks:**  
- **Cold-Packing + Priority Handling:**  
  - Express orders needing cold-packing may preempt standard orders, worsening cold-station queues. This could create a *cascading delay* (e.g., ORD-5002 preempting ORD-5001 in the log).  
- **Batching + Hazardous Limits:**  
  - Batches for the same region may contain multiple hazardous orders. If these orders hit the 10-order limit during packing/QC, the entire batch stalls, causing *deadlock-like delays*.  
- **Express Orders + Batching:**  
  - Batching express orders (to optimize shipping) may conflict with their urgency, leading to *priority dilution* (e.g., an express order waiting for batch peers).  

**Why Interactions Matter:**  
Optimizing one constraint in isolation (e.g., adding cold-packing stations) may exacerbate others (e.g., more hazardous orders processed simultaneously, risking compliance). Holistic analysis prevents suboptimal solutions.

### **3. Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**  
**Strategy 1: Dynamic Cold-Packing Allocation + Priority Tiers**  
- **Target Constraints:** Shared cold-packing, priority handling.  
- **Changes:**  
  - Implement a **tiered cold-packing queue**: Express cold orders > Standard cold orders > Non-cold orders (if stations convertible).  
  - Use **real-time demand forecasting** (via historical seasonality data) to temporarily convert standard stations to cold stations during peaks.  
- **Data Leverage:** Predict cold-packing demand using ML models (e.g., based on order type, item category).  
- **Expected Outcomes:**  
  -  Cold-packing waiting time by 30%.  
  -  Preemptions of standard orders by reserving 1–2 stations for express only.  

**Strategy 2: Time-Triggered Batching with Hazardous Caps**  
- **Target Constraints:** Batching delays, hazardous material limits.  
- **Changes:**  
  - Replace fixed batching with **dynamic triggers**:  
    - *Non-hazardous orders:* Batch when 5 orders are ready *or* 15 min elapsed.  
    - *Hazardous orders:* Smaller batches (max 3–4 orders) to avoid hitting the 10-order limit.  
  - **Decouple hazardous handling** by adding a pre-batch regulatory checkpoint.  
- **Data Leverage:** Optimize batch size/duration using clustering analysis on historical regional demand.  
- **Expected Outcomes:**  
  -  Batch formation delay by 40% (especially for express orders).  
  - Ensure hazardous compliance while reducing waits.  

**Strategy 3: Hazardous-Aware Scheduling + Resource Buffering**  
- **Target Constraints:** Hazardous limits, resource contention.  
- **Changes:**  
  - **Cap-based scheduling:** Use a digital token system to limit concurrent hazardous orders in packing/QC (max 10).  
  - **Buffer non-hazardous QC resources** to absorb delays when hazardous cap is reached.  
  - **Minor redesign:** Move "Hazardous Material Check" *before* packing to stagger flow.  
- **Data Leverage:** Simulate token allocation impact using historical hazardous order arrival rates.  
- **Expected Outcomes:**  
  -  Hazardous order throughput by 20% without violating compliance.  
  -  Contention for non-hazardous resources.  

---

### **4. Simulation and Validation**  
**Simulation Approach:**  
- Build a **discrete-event simulation model** using process mining outputs:  
  - **Inputs:** Discovered process model, activity durations, resource pools, and constraint rules (e.g., cold-station count, hazardous cap).  
  - **Key Enhancements:**  
    - Model *preemption logic* for express orders.  
    - Embed *dynamic batching algorithms* (e.g., time-triggered).  
    - Implement *hazardous token counters* for packing/QC.  
- **Validation Focus:**  
  - **Accuracy:** Calibrate using historical KPIs (e.g., cycle time distribution).  
  - **Constraint Handling:** Ensure the simulator enforces:  
    - Cold-station contention and preemption.  
    - Batch waiting times.  
    - Hazardous caps (block new orders when limit reached).  
  - **KPI Impact:** Test scenarios (e.g., peak season) to measure changes in:  
    - End-to-end time (target:  25%).  
    - On-time delivery rate (target:  15%).  

---

### **5. Monitoring Post-Implementation**  
**Metrics & Dashboards:**  
- **Core KPIs:**  
  - Overall cycle time, on-time delivery %, throughput.  
- **Constraint-Specific Metrics:**  
  | **Constraint**          | **Key Metrics**                                  | **Dashboard Visualization**       |  
  |--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
  | Cold-Packing Stations    | Queue length, avg wait time, station utilization | Real-time station heatmap         |  
  | Batching                 | Batch formation time, batch size distribution    | Regional batch-tracking timeline  |  
  | Priority Handling        | Express delay, preemption frequency              | Order-type comparison charts      |  
  | Hazardous Materials      | Concurrent orders, compliance %                  | Hazardous counter with alerts     |  

**Continuous Improvement:**  
- **Alerts:** Trigger if cold-packing queue > 3 orders or hazardous count 9.  
- **Root-Cause Analysis:** Use **performance dashboards** to:  
  - Correlate constraint violations (e.g., batch delays + hazardous caps).  
  - Track express order cycle time vs. standard orders to ensure priority integrity.  
- **Feedback Loop:** Re-run process mining quarterly to update simulation parameters.  

### **Summary**  
By leveraging process mining to quantify constraint impacts, designing interdependent strategies (dynamic allocation, smart batching, cap-aware scheduling), and using simulation for validation, the fulfillment center can reduce delays by 25–40% while maintaining compliance. Post-implementation monitoring ensures continuous optimization of these instance-spanning constraints.
