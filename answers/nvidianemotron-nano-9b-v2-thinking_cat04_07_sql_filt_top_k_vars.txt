Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the top K process variants based on the frequency of their activity sequences and then return all events from those top K cases. 

First, I need to understand what a process variant is. It's the ordered sequence of activities for a case, sorted by timestamp. So for each case_id, I have to arrange the activities in the order they happened. That makes sense. 

The first step is to generate the sequence of activities per case. In SQL, especially DuckDB, I can use window functions to order the events by timestamp within each case. So for each case_id, I can order the activities by timestamp and then concatenate them into a string or some ordered representation. 

Wait, how do I create a sequence string? Maybe using STRING_AGG function. But I need to make sure that the activities are ordered correctly. So for each case_id, I can order the rows by timestamp and then aggregate the activities into a single string. That would give me the sequence for each case. 

Once I have the sequences, I need to group by these sequences to count how many cases have each variant. Then, I can order these counts in descending order and pick the top K. 

But how to handle the top K? Since K is a parameter, maybe the user will input it, but in the query, perhaps we can use a window function or a subquery to get the top K counts. 

Then, after identifying the top K variants, I need to filter the original event log to include only events from cases that are in those top K variants. 

So the plan is:

1. For each case_id, generate the activity sequence ordered by timestamp.
2. Count the number of cases per sequence (variant).
3. Determine the top K variants by count.
4. Select all events from cases that belong to these top K variants.

Let me think about the SQL structure. 

First, the initial step would be to create a CTE (Common Table Expression) that for each case_id, orders the activities by timestamp and concatenates them into a sequence. 

So something like:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)

But maybe I don't need the row number. Alternatively, I can use STRING_AGG with ORDER BY. Wait, in DuckDB, STRING_AGG allows an ORDER BY clause. So perhaps:

WITH sequence_per_case AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->') AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
)

Wait, no. The STRING_AGG function in DuckDB can take an ORDER BY. So for each case_id, we can order the activities by timestamp and then aggregate them. So the correct way would be:

SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id

Yes, that should work. Because for each case_id, the activities are ordered by timestamp, and then concatenated with '->' as the separator. 

Once I have the activity_sequence for each case, I can then count how many cases have each sequence. So:

SELECT 
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS case_count
FROM sequence_per_case
GROUP BY activity_sequence
ORDER BY case_count DESC

Then, to get the top K, I can use a window function or a subquery. For example, using a CTE to get the counts, then select the top K. 

But how to handle K? Since K is a parameter, maybe the user will replace it with a specific number. But in the query, perhaps we can use a subquery with LIMIT K. However, in DuckDB, the LIMIT applies to the entire result set. So if I have a CTE that has the counts ordered by case_count DESC, then I can take the top K rows. 

So:

WITH sequence_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM sequence_per_case
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM sequence_counts
    LIMIT K
)

Then, the final step is to join the original event_log with the top_k_variants to get all events from cases that are in the top K. 

So:

SELECT 
    el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN sequence_per_case spc ON el.case_id = spc.case_id
JOIN top_k_variants tv ON spc.activity_sequence = tv.activity_sequence

But wait, the sequence_per_case CTE is needed to get the activity_sequence for each case. So putting it all together:

WITH sequence_per_case AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
sequence_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM sequence_per_case
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM sequence_counts
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN sequence_per_case spc ON el.case_id = spc.case_id
JOIN top_k_variants tv ON spc.activity_sequence = tv.activity_sequence
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;

But wait, the problem says to return all events from the original event log that belong to the top K variants. So this query should work. 

But I need to make sure that the K is a parameter. However, in the problem statement, the user might need to replace K with a specific number. But since the prompt says "top K variants", the query should have K as a variable. However, in DuckDB, you can't have a variable unless you use a parameter. But in the context of the problem, perhaps the user is expected to write the query with K as a placeholder. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the query to be written with K as a parameter, but in the actual SQL, it's a number. But since the problem says "top K", the answer should include K as a variable. 

Another thing to consider: the STRING_AGG function in DuckDB. Let me check the syntax. Yes, STRING_AGG can take an ORDER BY. So the sequence_per_case CTE is correct. 

But what if there are multiple activities with the same timestamp? The problem says to sort by timestamp, but if there are ties, the order might not be deterministic. However, the problem doesn't mention handling that, so we can assume that timestamps are unique per case, or that the order is determined by the timestamp and perhaps the order in the table. 

Another point: the activity_sequence is a string that represents the ordered activities. For example, if a case has activities A, B, C in that order, the sequence would be "A->B->C". 

Now, the next step is to count how many cases have each sequence. Then, select the top K. 

But in the sequence_counts CTE, we group by activity_sequence and count the number of cases. Then, order by case_count descending. 

Then, the top_k_variants CTE selects the top K activity_sequences. 

Finally, the main query joins the original event_log with the sequence_per_case and top_k_variants to get all events from those cases. 

This should work. 

But let me test with an example. Suppose K is 2. 

Suppose there are three cases:

Case 1: A -> B -> C (count 1)
Case 2: A -> B -> C (count 2)
Case 3: D -> E (count 1)

Then the sequence_counts would have A->B->C with count 2, D->E with count 1. So top 2 would be A->B->C and D->E. 

Then, the final query would return all events from cases 1, 2, 3. 

Yes. 

But what if K is 1? Then only the most frequent variant is selected. 

So the query seems correct. 

But I need to make sure that the STRING_AGG is ordered by timestamp. 

Another thing: the original event_log may have multiple events per case, and the sequence_per_case CTE groups by case_id and aggregates the activities in order. 

Yes. 

So the final query should be as above. 

But in the problem statement, the user is to return all events from the original event log that belong to the top K variants. So the final SELECT is correct. 

But in the problem, the user is to write a single query. So the entire thing would be a single query with CTEs. 

So the final answer would be the SQL query as written, with K as a parameter. 

But in DuckDB, the LIMIT K would require K to be a number. So if the user is to replace K with a specific number, but the problem says "top K", so the answer should have K as a variable. 

Therefore, the correct SQL query is as above, with K in the LIMIT clause. 

But I need to make sure that the K is properly handled. For example, if K is 3, then the top 3 variants. 

Another possible issue: the activity_sequence could be very long, but that's acceptable. 

So the final answer is the SQL query with the CTEs as described.

To solve this problem, we need to identify the top K process variants from an event log and return all events from cases that belong to these top K variants. A process variant is defined as the ordered sequence of activities for a case, determined by sorting events by their timestamps. 

### Approach
1. **Generate Activity Sequences**: For each case, generate a sequence of activities ordered by their timestamps. This is done using the `STRING_AGG` function with an `ORDER BY` clause to ensure activities are concatenated in the correct order.
2. **Count Variants**: Aggregate and count how many cases correspond to each unique activity sequence (variant).
3. **Identify Top K Variants**: Determine the top K variants based on their frequency (count of cases).
4. **Filter Events**: Return all events from the original event log that belong to cases associated with these top K variants.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH sequence_per_case AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
sequence_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM sequence_per_case
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM sequence_counts
    LIMIT K  -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN sequence_per_case spc ON el.case_id = spc.case_id
JOIN top_k_variants tv ON spc.activity_sequence = tv.activity_sequence
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

### Explanation
1. **sequence_per_case CTE**: This CTE generates the activity sequence for each case by concatenating activities in the order of their timestamps using `STRING_AGG`.
2. **sequence_counts CTE**: This CTE counts how many cases correspond to each unique activity sequence, ordering them by frequency in descending order.
3. **top_k_variants CTE**: This CTE selects the top K activity sequences based on their counts using the `LIMIT K` clause.
4. **Final Query**: The main query joins the original event log with the sequences and top K variants to filter and return all events from cases that are part of the top K variants, ordered by case ID and timestamp.

This approach efficiently processes the event log to identify the most frequent process variants and retrieves the relevant events, ensuring correctness and clarity in the results.
