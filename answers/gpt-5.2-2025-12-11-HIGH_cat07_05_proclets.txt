The visualization is a multi-part diagram showing how two healthcare workflow “procelet” (process) classes interact via message channels.

**(a) Two procelet classes connected through two channels**
- On the **left** is a **Lab visit** process (with roles like *doctor*, *lab assistant*, *lab assistant judge*). It includes steps such as **Order entry**, **Take blood sample**, **Judge results**, and conditional paths like **Everything fine** vs. **Do tests again**, ending with **Send report**.
- On the **right** is a **Lab test** process (with the role *chemical analyst*). It includes **Perform test**, **Make report**, potential looping via **Perform test again** and **Provide updated report**, and then **Finish lab test**.
- The two processes communicate through dashed, labeled **channels/systems**:
  - **Order system** (used to initiate/coordinate testing)
  - **HIS** (Hospital Information System) for exchanging results/updated results
- Message exchanges are depicted as connections between activities (e.g., “Receive result”, “Receive updated result”) across these channels.

**(b) Class diagram**
- A simple UML-style relationship: **Lab visit** “requires” **Lab test**.
- Multiplicities indicate one lab visit is associated with **one or more** lab tests (shown as `1..1` to `1..*`).

**(c) Example message/performative table**
- A sample communication record with columns like **Time, Channel, Sender, Receivers, Action, Content, Scope, Direction**.
- Example entry: at **11:00**, via **Order system**, sender **“Lab visit – John”** sends to receiver **“Lab test – HGB”** an action **Create** with content asking if an **HGB test** can be performed, marked **Private** and **OUT** (outgoing).
