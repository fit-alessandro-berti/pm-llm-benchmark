Based on the provided data, I can describe the underlying process as follows:

1. General Process Flow:
   This appears to be an expense declaration and payment process within an organization. The basic flow typically involves:
   
   a. An employee submits a declaration
   b. The declaration goes through one or more approval stages
   c. If approved, a payment is requested and handled
   d. If rejected at any stage, the declaration may be resubmitted or abandoned

2. Key Roles Involved:
   - EMPLOYEE: Initiates the process by submitting or saving declarations
   - ADMINISTRATION: Often the first level of approval
   - PRE_APPROVER: An alternative first level of approval in some cases
   - BUDGET OWNER: An additional level of approval in some variants
   - SUPERVISOR: Usually provides the final approval
   - MISSING: An unclear role that sometimes rejects declarations after final approval

3. Main Process Variants:
   a. Simple approval: EMPLOYEE -> ADMINISTRATION -> SUPERVISOR -> Payment
   b. Extended approval: EMPLOYEE -> ADMINISTRATION -> BUDGET OWNER -> SUPERVISOR -> Payment
   c. Pre-approver variant: EMPLOYEE -> PRE_APPROVER -> SUPERVISOR -> Payment
   d. Direct to supervisor: EMPLOYEE -> SUPERVISOR -> Payment

4. Rejection Handling:
   - Declarations can be rejected at various stages (ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER)
   - Rejected declarations are typically sent back to the EMPLOYEE
   - The EMPLOYEE can then resubmit the declaration, starting the process again
   - In some cases, rejections lead to the process ending without payment

5. Special Cases:
   - Some declarations are simply SAVED by the EMPLOYEE without submission
   - There are rare cases where a payment is handled immediately after SUPERVISOR approval without a separate request step
   - In some instances, a declaration is rejected by a "MISSING" role after SUPERVISOR approval, requiring resubmission

6. Performance Metrics:
   - Each variant has an associated frequency (number of occurrences) and performance measure (possibly time or cost-related)
   - Simpler paths generally have higher frequencies
   - More complex paths (with multiple rejections and resubmissions) tend to have lower frequencies but higher performance values

7. Process Complexity:
   - The process has numerous variants, ranging from very simple (3-4 steps) to highly complex (up to 14 steps in some cases)
   - The most frequent variants are the simpler ones, while the more complex variants with multiple rejections and approvals are less common

This process seems designed to handle expense declarations with varying levels of scrutiny and approval, allowing for rejections and resubmissions as needed. The multiple variants likely accommodate different types of expenses, employee levels, or declaration amounts that require different approval paths.
