# **Data-Driven Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.**
*Leveraging Process Mining for Advanced Job Shop Scheduling*

## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

Process mining provides a powerful lens to reconstruct and analyze the *actual* execution of jobs in Precision Parts Inc.’s complex job shop. By extracting, transforming, and analyzing MES event logs, we can quantify performance, identify inefficiencies, and uncover hidden patterns in scheduling dynamics.

### **1.1 Process Discovery & Reconstruction**
**Objective:** Reconstruct the *as-is* process flow of jobs, including task sequences, resource allocations, and timing.

**Techniques & Tools:**
- **Process Discovery Algorithms:**
  - **Inductive Miner** (for structured process trees) or **Heuristics Miner** (for noisy logs) to visualize job routings.
  - **Fuzzy Miner** to simplify complex process maps while preserving key paths.
- **Performance Spectrum Analysis:**
  - Overlay timing data (e.g., task durations, waiting times) on process maps to identify bottlenecks and delays.
- **Resource Perspective Analysis:**
  - Use **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** to model interactions between machines, operators, and jobs (e.g., which machines are most frequently contended).

**Output:**
- A **process map** showing:
  - Most common job routings (e.g., Cutting  Milling  Grinding  Inspection).
  - Alternative paths (e.g., jobs skipping Heat Treatment).
  - Frequency of rework loops (e.g., jobs sent back for re-grinding).
- **Spaghetti diagrams** highlighting complex, non-standard flows.

### **1.3 Example: Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Analysis**
**Problem:** Setup times vary based on the previous job processed (e.g., switching from aluminum to titanium requires a longer setup).

**Process Mining Approach:**
1. **Extract Setup Events:**
   - Filter logs for `Setup Start` and `Setup End` events.
   - Join with the **previous job** on the same machine.
2. **Build Transition Matrix:**
   - For each machine, create a matrix where:
     - **Rows = Previous Job Type** (e.g., "Aluminum Part," "Steel Part").
     - **Columns = Current Job Type**.
     - **Cell Value = Average Setup Time** (mined from logs).
3. **Cluster Jobs by Setup Similarity:**
   - Use **k-means clustering** on job attributes (material, geometry, tolerance) to group jobs with **low setup times** when sequenced together.

**Output:**
- A **setup time heatmap** for each machine (e.g., `CUT-01`):
  ```
  | Previous Job \ Current Job | Aluminum | Steel | Titanium |
  |----------------------------|----------|-------|----------|
  | Aluminum                   | 5 min    | 20 min| 30 min   |
  | Steel                      | 15 min   | 5 min | 25 min   |
  | Titanium                   | 25 min   | 20 min| 5 min    |
  ```
- **Insight:** Sequencing `Aluminum  Aluminum` minimizes setup time, while `Titanium  Aluminum` is costly.

| **Disruption Amplification**           | - **Breakdowns** (e.g., `MILL-02`) cause **cascading delays** (e.g., +3h lead time for all downstream jobs).<br>- **Hot jobs** disrupt schedules, increasing tardiness for other jobs by **20-40%**.                     | - Unreliable schedules.<br>- Missed due dates.                            |

## **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

We propose **three sophisticated, data-driven scheduling strategies** that leverage process mining insights to address Precision Parts Inc.’s challenges.

---

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Factor Dispatching Rules (DMFDR)**
**Objective:** Replace static FCFS/EDD rules with **adaptive, data-driven dispatching** that considers:
- Job priority.
- Due date.
- Downstream machine load.
- Sequence-dependent setup times.
- Remaining processing time.

#### **Core Logic:**
1. **Real-Time Shop Floor State:**
   - Maintain a **live dashboard** of:
     - Machine status (idle, busy, breakdown).
     - Queue lengths at each machine.
     - Job progress (remaining tasks, time to completion).
2. **Dynamic Priority Scoring:**
   - For each job `J` at machine `M`, compute a **priority score** `P(J, M)`:
     ```
     P(J, M) = w * (Due Date - Current Time)¹
               + w * Job Priority
               + w * (1 / Estimated Setup Time(J, M))
               + w * (1 / Downstream Machine Load)
               + w * (1 / Remaining Processing Time)
     ```
   - **Weights (`w` to `w`)** are **learned from historical data** (e.g., using regression to minimize tardiness).
3. **Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Estimation:**
   - Use the **setup time matrix** (from process mining) to predict setup time for `J` based on the **previous job on `M`**.
4. **Dispatching Decision:**
   - At each machine, **select the job with the highest `P(J, M)`**.

#### **Process Mining Insights Used:**
- **Setup time matrix** (to estimate `Setup Time(J, M)`).
- **Historical task durations** (to estimate `Remaining Processing Time`).
- **Downstream machine load** (from real-time queue data).
- **Tardiness regression model** (to optimize weights `w` to `w`).

#### **Expected Impact:**
| **KPI**               | **Baseline**       | **DMFDR**          | **Improvement**       |
|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Avg. Tardiness        | 12h                | 6h                 | **50% reduction**     |
| % On-Time Jobs        | 65%                | 85%                | **+20pp**             |
| Avg. Setup Time       | 25min              | 15min              | **40% reduction**     |
| WIP Levels            | 15 jobs            | 10 jobs            | **33% reduction**     |
| Bottleneck Utilization| 92%                | 88%                | **More balanced load**|

---

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Machine Learning (PS-ML)**
**Objective:** Generate **realistic, adaptive schedules** using:
- **Predictive task duration models** (accounting for job complexity, operator skill, machine condition).
- **Predictive maintenance** (to avoid breakdowns).
- **Dynamic rescheduling** in response to disruptions.

#### **Core Logic:**
1. **Predictive Task Duration Model:**
   - Train a **random forest regressor** to predict task duration based on:
     - Job attributes (material, geometry, tolerance).
     - Machine (`CUT-01`, `MILL-03`, etc.).
     - Operator (`OP-105`, `OP-102`, etc.).
     - Historical performance (e.g., `OP-105` is 10% faster on aluminum).
   - **Input:** `(Job_ID, Task_Type, Machine_ID, Operator_ID, Job_Attributes)`
   - **Output:** `Predicted_Duration`
2. **Predictive Maintenance:**
   - Use **sensor data + historical breakdown logs** to predict:
     - **Probability of machine failure** in the next 4h.
     - **Expected downtime duration**.
   - **Input:** `(Machine_ID, Runtime_Hours, Vibration_Level, Temperature)`
   - **Output:** `Failure_Probability, Expected_Downtime`
3. **Dynamic Scheduling Engine:**
   - **Initial Schedule:**
     - Use **constraint programming (CP)** or **genetic algorithms (GA)** to generate an **optimal schedule** based on:
       - Predicted task durations.
       - Setup time matrix.
       - Due dates.
       - Machine availability.
   - **Real-Time Rescheduling:**
     - When a **disruption occurs** (breakdown, hot job), **re-optimize the schedule** using:
       - **Rolling horizon approach** (replan next 8h).
       - **Priority-based insertion** for hot jobs.

#### **Process Mining Insights Used:**
- **Historical task durations** (to train the predictive model).
- **Breakdown logs** (to train the predictive maintenance model).
- **Setup time matrix** (for initial scheduling).
- **Job routings** (to model dependencies).

#### **Expected Impact:**

### **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization via Intelligent Batching & Sequencing (STO-IBS)**
**Objective:** **Minimize sequence-dependent setup times** by:
- **Batching similar jobs** (e.g., all aluminum jobs together).
- **Optimizing job sequences** at bottleneck machines.

#### **Core Logic:**
1. **Job Clustering:**
   - Use **k-means clustering** on job attributes (material, geometry, tolerance) to group jobs with **low setup times** when sequenced together.
   - **Example Clusters:**
     - **Cluster 1:** Aluminum parts with tight tolerances.
     - **Cluster 2:** Steel parts with standard tolerances.
2. **Setup Time-Aware Sequencing:**
   - For each machine, **solve a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** where:
     - **Cities = Jobs**.
     - **Distance = Setup Time** (from the setup time matrix).
   - **Objective:** Minimize total setup time while respecting due dates.
3. **Dynamic Batching:**
   - **Batch size** is determined by:
     - **Queue length** (e.g., if 5 similar jobs are waiting, batch them).
     - **Due date urgency** (e.g., don’t batch if it delays a high-priority job).
   - **Implementation:**
     - When a machine becomes idle, **select the largest possible batch** of similar jobs.

#### **Process Mining Insights Used:**
- **Setup time matrix** (to define TSP distances).
- **Job attribute data** (for clustering).
- **Historical job sequences** (to validate clustering).

#### **Expected Impact:**
| **KPI**               | **Baseline**       | **STO-IBS**        | **Improvement**       |
|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Avg. Setup Time       | 25min              | 10min              | **60% reduction**     |
| Machine Utilization   | 85%                | 90%                | **+5pp**              |
| Throughput            | 20 jobs/day        | 25 jobs/day        | **+25%**              |
| WIP Levels            | 15 jobs            | 12 jobs            | **20% reduction**     |

## **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

### **5.1 Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) for Strategy Testing**
**Objective:** Rigorously test scheduling strategies **before live deployment** using a **digital twin** of the shop floor.

#### **Simulation Setup:**
1. **Input Data (Derived from Process Mining):**
   - **Job arrival patterns** (Poisson process, with seasonal peaks).
   - **Job routings** (from process maps).
   - **Task duration distributions** (log-normal, fitted to historical data).
   - **Setup time matrix** (from sequence mining).
   - **Breakdown frequencies & durations** (from maintenance logs).
   - **Operator skill levels** (from performance analysis).
2. **Scenarios to Test:**
   | **Scenario**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                 |
   |----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Baseline (Current State)** | FCFS + EDD dispatching rules.                                                                                                                  |
   | **High Load**              | 30% increase in job arrivals.                                                                                                                  |
   | **Frequent Disruptions**   | 2x breakdown frequency + 1 hot job per day.                                                                                                    |
   | **Mixed Priority Jobs**    | 20% high-priority, 30% medium, 50% low.                                                                                                        |
   | **Bottleneck Overload**    | `MILL-03` utilization >95%.                                                                                                                     |
3. **KPIs to Measure:**
   - **Tardiness** (avg., max, % late jobs).
   - **WIP levels** (avg., max).
   - **Machine utilization** (productive, setup, idle, breakdown).
   - **Throughput** (jobs/day).
   - **Schedule stability** (number of rescheduling events).

#### **Example Simulation Results:**
| **Strategy**       | **Avg. Tardiness** | **% On-Time** | **Avg. WIP** | **Bottleneck Utilization** | **Throughput** |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| Baseline (FCFS+EDD)| 12h                | 65%           | 15 jobs      | 92%                        | 20 jobs/day    |
| DMFDR              | 6h                 | 85%           | 10 jobs      | 88%                        | 22 jobs/day    |
| PS-ML              | 4h                 | 90%           | 8 jobs       | 85%                        | 24 jobs/day    |
| STO-IBS            | 8h                 | 75%           | 12 jobs      | 90%                        | 25 jobs/day    |
| **Hybrid (PS-ML + STO-IBS)** | **3h**       | **92%**       | **7 jobs**   | **87%**                    | **26 jobs/day**|

**Insight:** A **hybrid approach (PS-ML + STO-IBS)** performs best, combining **predictive scheduling** with **setup time optimization**.

### **5.2 Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation Framework**
**Objective:** Ensure the scheduling system **adapts to changing conditions** (e.g., new job types, machine upgrades, operator turnover).

#### **Framework Components:**
1. **Real-Time Process Mining Dashboard:**
   - **Live KPIs:**
     - Tardiness, WIP, machine utilization, setup times.
   - **Anomaly Detection:**
     - **Statistical Process Control (SPC)** to flag deviations (e.g., sudden increase in waiting times).
     - **Change Point Detection** to identify shifts in performance.
2. **Automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**
   - When a KPI degrades (e.g., tardiness increases by 20%), **automatically analyze logs** to find causes:
     - **Bottleneck shifts** (e.g., `HEAT-01` now overloaded).
     - **New job types** with longer setup times.
     - **Operator performance changes** (e.g., `OP-105` slower due to training).
3. **Adaptive Scheduling:**
   - **Re-train ML models** (e.g., task duration predictor) **weekly**.
   - **Adjust dispatching rule weights** (e.g., increase `w` for due date if tardiness rises).
   - **Update setup time matrix** as new job types are introduced.
4. **Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement:**
   - **A/B Testing:** Deploy **two scheduling strategies** in parallel (e.g., DMFDR vs. PS-ML) and compare performance.
   - **Operator Feedback:** Allow operators to **flag inefficiencies** (e.g., "This job should have been batched").
   - **Post-Mortem Analysis:** After major disruptions, **analyze logs** to improve rescheduling logic.

#### **Example Workflow:**
1. **Alert:** Tardiness increases from 4h to 6h.
2. **RCA:** Process mining reveals:
   - `MILL-03` queue times increased from 4h to 8h.
   - New job type (`Titanium Parts`) has **longer setup times** on `MILL-03`.
3. **Adaptation:**
   - **Update setup time matrix** for `MILL-03`.
   - **Increase `w` (setup time weight)** in DMFDR.
   - **Add a second shift** to `MILL-03` if utilization >90%.
4. **Validation:**
   - **Simulate the change** before deployment.
   - **Monitor KPIs** post-implementation.

## **Conclusion & Recommendations**

### **Key Findings from Process Mining:**
1. **Bottlenecks (`MILL-03`, `HEAT-01`)** are the **primary drivers of tardiness and WIP**.
2. **Sequence-dependent setup times** account for **30-50% of machine time** and are **poorly optimized**.
3. **Static dispatching rules (FCFS/EDD)** fail to account for **dynamic shop floor conditions**.
4. **Disruptions (breakdowns, hot jobs)** amplify delays due to **lack of rescheduling mechanisms**.
5. **Task duration variability** (e.g., `Cutting` ranges 45-90min) leads to **unreliable schedules**.
