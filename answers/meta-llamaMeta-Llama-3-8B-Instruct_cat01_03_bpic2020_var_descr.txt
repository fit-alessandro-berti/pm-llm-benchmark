A fascinating data set!

Based on the process variants, I'll try to extract the underlying process and describe it in a high-level manner:

**Process Overview**

The process appears to be an approval-based workflow for employee declarations, ultimately leading to payment handling. The process involves multiple stages, including submission, approval, rejection, and final approval by different roles (Employee, Administration, Budget Owner, and Supervisor).

**Stages and Roles**

The process can be broken down into the following stages and roles:

1. **Declaration Submission**: An employee submits a declaration.
2. **Initial Approval**: The declaration is reviewed by Administration (approval or rejection).
3. **Re-Submission**: If rejected, the employee can resubmit the declaration.
4. **Budget Owner Approval**: If approved by Administration, the declaration is reviewed by the Budget Owner (approval or rejection).
5. **Final Approval**: The declaration is reviewed by the Supervisor (approval or rejection).
6. **Request Payment**: If the declaration is finally approved, a request for payment is generated.
7. **Payment Handling**: The payment is handled, likely involving additional steps such as payment processing, invoicing, and settlement.

**Error and Rejection Paths**

The process also includes error and rejection paths, where the declaration is rejected at various stages and the employee can resubmit or re-try the declaration. These paths include:

* Rejection by Administration, Budget Owner, or Supervisor
* Rejection by multiple roles in series (e.g., Admin -> Budget Owner -> Supervisor)
* Re-Save option for the employee to resubmit the declaration

**Performance Indicators**

The data includes performance indicators (frequency and performance metrics) for each process variant. These metrics likely measure the efficiency, speed, and success rate of the process for each variant.

Overall, this process seems to be a complex workflow with multiple stages, roles, and error paths, requiring careful analysis and optimization to ensure efficient and effective processing of employee declarations and subsequent payment handling.
