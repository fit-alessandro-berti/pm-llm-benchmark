Below is a structured BPMN-like textual process model based on the provided interview transcripts for the invoice approval process. The model consolidates the accounts from the stakeholders (Accounts Payable Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, Accounts Payable Supervisor, and Supplier Relationship Manager) into a clear sequence of activities, decision points, roles, and exceptions. Where inconsistencies or ambiguities arise, I’ve noted them for clarity.
BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process
Process Overview
The invoice approval process begins when an invoice is received and ends when it is scheduled for payment. It involves validating the invoice, confirming receipt of goods/services, obtaining managerial approval, and handling exceptions as they arise.
Pools and Participants
Accounts Payable (AP): Includes Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) and Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).
Purchasing Department: Includes Purchasing Officer (Dan).
Department Manager: Includes Department Manager (Carlos).
Supplier Relationship Manager: Includes Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen).
Supplier: External entity providing invoices and clarifications.
Accounting System: Automated system for logging, matching, and notifications.
Process Flow
Start Event:  
Description: An invoice is received by email from the Supplier.  
Role: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).  
Artifact/Input: Invoice (digital document).
Task: Validate Purchase Order (PO) Reference  
Description: The Accounts Payable Clerk checks if the invoice includes a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.  
Role: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).  
Sequence Flow: Proceeds to Gateway 1.  
Artifact/Input: Invoice.
Gateway 1: Valid PO Number? (Exclusive Gateway)  
Condition: Does the invoice contain a valid PO number?  
Path 1: Yes  
Leads to Task: Log Invoice into Accounting System.
Path 2: No  
Leads to Task: Request PO from Supplier.
Task: Request PO from Supplier  
Description: The Accounts Payable Clerk emails the Supplier to request a PO number or additional details. The Supplier Relationship Manager may assist if clarification is needed (e.g., checking contract terms).  
Roles: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Supplier (external), optionally Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen).  
Sequence Flow: Loops back to Task: Validate PO Reference once the Supplier responds with a revised invoice or PO number.  
Artifact/Output: Email to Supplier, potentially a revised invoice.
Task: Log Invoice into Accounting System  
Description: The invoice is entered into the accounting system with relevant details (e.g., PO number, amount).  
Role: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).  
Sequence Flow: Proceeds to Task: Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation.  
Artifact/Output: Invoice record in the Accounting System.
Task: Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation  
Description: The Accounts Payable Clerk sends the invoice details to the Purchasing Department via email or system notification.  
Role: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).  
Sequence Flow: Proceeds to Task: Confirm Receipt and Match Details.  
Artifact/Input: Invoice, PO reference.
Task: Confirm Receipt and Match Details  
Description: The Purchasing Officer verifies that goods/services were received and matches invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) against the PO.  
Role: Purchasing Officer (Dan).  
Sequence Flow: Proceeds to Gateway 2.  
Artifact/Input: Invoice, PO (from system).
Gateway 2: Details Match PO? (Exclusive Gateway)  
Condition: Do the invoice details match the PO (quantities, prices, etc.)?  
Path 1: Yes  
Leads to Task: Send Confirmation to Accounts Payable.
Path 2: No  
Leads to Task: Investigate Discrepancy.
Task: Investigate Discrepancy  
Description: The Purchasing Officer contacts the Supplier to resolve discrepancies (e.g., incorrect pricing, extra units). The Supplier Relationship Manager may assist by referencing the contract. If unresolved, the Accounts Payable Clerk escalates to the Accounts Payable Supervisor.  
Roles: Purchasing Officer (Dan), Supplier (external), optionally Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen), Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
Sequence Flow: Proceeds to Gateway 3.  
Artifact/Output: Updated invoice or clarification from Supplier.
Gateway 3: Discrepancy Resolved? (Exclusive Gateway)  
Condition: Is the discrepancy resolved (e.g., corrected invoice received or issue clarified)?  
Path 1: Yes  
Loops back to Task: Confirm Receipt and Match Details.
Path 2: No  
Leads to Task: Handle Exception (Escalation).
Task: Handle Exception (Escalation)  
Description: The Accounts Payable Supervisor coordinates with departments or the Supplier to resolve complex issues (e.g., missing PO for informal services, unresolvable discrepancies). May involve creating a retrospective PO or rejecting the invoice.  
Role: Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), potentially Department Manager (Carlos) or Supplier.  
Sequence Flow: If resolved, loops back to Task: Confirm Receipt and Match Details; if rejected, process ends (see End Event: Invoice Rejected).  
Artifact/Output: Retrospective PO or rejection decision.
Task: Send Confirmation to Accounts Payable  
Description: The Purchasing Officer emails confirmation to the Accounts Payable Clerk that the invoice matches the PO and goods/services were received.  
Role: Purchasing Officer (Dan).  
Sequence Flow: Proceeds to Task: Match Invoice in System.  
Artifact/Output: Confirmation email.
Task: Match Invoice in System  
Description: The Accounts Payable Clerk matches invoice line items against the PO in the accounting system based on Purchasing’s confirmation.  
Role: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).  
Sequence Flow: Proceeds to Task: Request Manager Approval.  
Artifact/Input: Invoice, PO, confirmation from Purchasing.
Task: Request Manager Approval  
Description: The accounting system sends an automatic email to the Department Manager requesting approval, including invoice details, PO, and confirmation.  
Role: Accounting System, Accounts Payable Clerk (initiates).  
Sequence Flow: Proceeds to Task: Review and Approve Invoice.  
Artifact/Output: Approval request notification.
Task: Review and Approve Invoice  
Description: The Department Manager reviews the invoice in the system and approves it if all details (quantities, pricing, budget) are correct.  
Role: Department Manager (Carlos).  
Sequence Flow: Proceeds to Gateway 4.  
Artifact/Input: Invoice, PO, confirmation details.
Gateway 4: Manager Approves? (Exclusive Gateway)  
Condition: Does the Department Manager approve the invoice?  
Path 1: Yes  
Leads to Task: Schedule Payment.
Path 2: No  
Leads to Task: Reject or Hold for Investigation.
Task: Reject or Hold for Investigation  
Description: If the Manager rejects the invoice or flags issues (e.g., budget mismatch, unexpected items), the Accounts Payable Clerk investigates further, potentially escalating to the Supervisor.  
Roles: Department Manager (Carlos), Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), optionally Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
Sequence Flow: If resolved, loops back to Task: Review and Approve Invoice; if rejected, process ends (see End Event: Invoice Rejected).  
Artifact/Output: Rejection notice or investigation notes.
Task: Schedule Payment  
Description: The Accounts Payable Clerk schedules the approved invoice for the next payment cycle in the accounting system.  
Role: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).  
Sequence Flow: Proceeds to End Event: Invoice Scheduled for Payment.  
Artifact/Output: Payment schedule entry.
End Event: Invoice Scheduled for Payment  
Description: The invoice is successfully scheduled for payment, completing the process.  
Role: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
End Event: Invoice Rejected  
Description: The invoice is rejected due to unresolvable issues or Manager decision, terminating the process.  
Role: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) or Department Manager (Carlos).
Exceptions and Variations
Missing PO: If no PO exists (e.g., informal service contracts), the Accounts Payable Supervisor may create a retrospective PO, rejoining the normal flow.
Unresolvable Discrepancies: Escalation to the Supervisor can lead to rejection if issues persist.
Manager Rejection: Rare (per Carlos), but triggers rework or termination.
Supplier Delays: Delays in PO provision or discrepancy resolution may stall the process (not explicitly modeled as a timer but implied in loops).
Notes on Ambiguities
Role of Supplier Relationship Manager: Karen’s involvement is optional and situational; she doesn’t directly interact with the system.
Retrospective PO Process: Rita mentions creating retrospective POs, but the exact steps are unclear—assumed to rejoin Task: Confirm Receipt and Match Details.
Frequency of Exceptions: Escalations and rejections are infrequent (per Carlos and Rita), so the primary flow assumes successful progression.
This textual model captures the key activities, decision points, roles, and exceptions described in the interviews. It is structured to enable a straightforward translation into a BPMN diagram, with gateways clearly delineating decision paths and loops indicating rework where necessary.
