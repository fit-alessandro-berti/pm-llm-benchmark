Concept 1: **Terminal Node**
   Explanation**: Terminal node represents the final state in Petri nets wherein no further reactions can occur beyond this point.

**General Concept**: **Dynamical System**
   Explanation**: The Dynamical system concept is quite general and captures both the aspects of Petri Nets and the idea of a "source place" like concepts where we observe a sequence of changes over time that evolve according to underlying rules governing transitions between states, much like how dynamical systems in mathematics are defined by rule-based transformations.

Concept **2**: **Temporal Net**
   Explanation**: A Temporal net extends the concept of immediate transition nets whereby it adds explicit temporal delays in transitions which could be considered opposite concepts compared to those that do not consider timing explicitly within their operational dynamics.

**General Concept**: **N/A for "Immediate Transition" and "Live Transition""
   Explanation**: Immediate Transition nets operate under strict conditions where reactions must happen instantaneously without any delay whatsoever, making them an extreme case comparison considering the concept of time in transition dynamics.
   
Concept **3**: **Infinite Net**
   Explanation**: An infinite net allows for potentially endless states or configurations depending upon a system’s ongoing process rather than being bounded by a finite set like live transitions which are typically assumed to be limited within their possible states.

**General Concept**: **Complex Network**
   Explanation:** Complex Networks concept encapsulates both the dynamic and potentially non-linear relationship between various nodes in systems as well as the interconnection of those relationships similar to how Petri nets work internally linking places with transitions, but this broader perspective can be extended beyond just formal mathematical modeling techniques applied specifically within it.

Concept **4**: **Sequential System**
   Explanation:** A Sequential system contrasts notably with free choice nets by having processes or tasks ordered sequentially rather than allowing choice among multiple options simultaneously which are characteristic traits of the latter concept.

**General Concept**: **Hierarchical Model**
   Explanation:** Hierarchical models encompass structures organized into a hierarchy wherein elements (like places in Petri nets) have dependencies upon their position within this hierarchy compared to free choice nets that allow choices at every point, making them both more flexible but also potentially lacking structure when compared under certain conditions.

The above list is constructed such way considering opposite concepts for immediate transitions and live transitions while recognizing the nature of each concept (e.g., not being bounded by explicit time in 'infinite nets' or having a choice in operations as opposed to strictly sequential). The more general concepts are chosen based on their relevance towards modeling aspects which could contrast with focus areas within traditional Petri Nets theory & application effectively.

Please note this is highly theoretical and conceptual exploration rather than specific application of formal definitions or names within existing literature for each concept but aims at providing a broader understanding inspired by the provided list
