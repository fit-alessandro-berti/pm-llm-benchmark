The events can be grouped into **3 distinct cases** based on patient demographics (`patient_age` and `patient_gender`), department alignment, and logical activity sequences. Here's the grouping:

---

### **Case 1 (45-year-old male in ER):**  
- **Patient Journey:** ER registration → triage → X-ray → diagnosis → discharge.  
- **Events:**  
  1. `Register patient` (ER, 45M)  
  4. `Initial triage` (ER, 45M)  
  7. `X-ray imaging` (Radiology, 45M)  
  12. `Doctor consultation` (ER, 45M: hairline_fracture)  
  15. `Patient discharged` (ER, 45M)  

---

### **Case 2 (62-year-old female in ER):**  
- **Patient Journey:** ER registration → triage → lab work → diagnosis → prescription → discharge.  
- **Events:**  
  2. `Register patient` (ER, 62F)  
  5. `Initial triage` (ER, 62F)  
  8. `Lab test requested` (ER, 62F)  
  10. `Lab test completed` (Lab, 62F)  
  11. `Doctor consultation` (ER, 62F: minor_infection)  
  14. `Prescription created` (ER, 62F: antibiotics)  
  17. `Patient discharged` (ER, 62F)  

---

### **Case 3 (28-year-old male in Surgery):**  
- **Patient Journey:** Surgery registration → consultation → prep → surgery → recovery → discharge.  
- **Events:**  
  3. `Register patient` (Surgery, 28M)  
  6. `Doctor consultation` (Surgery, 28M: scheduled_knee_surgery)  
  9. `Surgery preparation` (Surgery, 28M)  
  13. `Surgery performed` (Surgery, 28M: arthroscopy)  
  16. `Recovery room` (Surgery, 28M)  
  18. `Patient discharged` (Surgery, 28M)  

---

### **Key Observations:**  
1. **Demographics as Primary Key:** `patient_age` and `patient_gender` uniquely identify each case.  
2. **Department Consistency:**  
   - Case 1 and 2 follow ER workflows, while Case 3 aligns with Surgery.  
   - Radiology/Lab events (e.g., X-ray, lab tests) are linked to ER cases.  
3. **Logical Activity Order:**  
   - ER cases: Registration → triage → diagnostics → treatment → discharge.  
   - Surgery case: Registration → consultation → prep → surgery → recovery → discharge.  
4. **Timestamps:** Sequential and non-overlapping for each case (e.g., 28M’s discharge occurs after surgery/recovery).  

**Note:** The interleaving of events (e.g., ER and Surgery activities occurring simultaneously) reflects parallel processing of multiple cases in a hospital setting.
