# Bias Analysis of the Loan Decision Process

## 1. Where Bias Manifests

### The Community Group Score Adjustment

The most explicit source of bias is the **+10 point "Community" adjustment** applied exclusively to members of the Highland Civic Darts Club:

| Case | Local Resident | Community Group | Raw Score | Adjusted Score | Decision |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| C001 | TRUE | Highland Civic Darts Club | 710 | 720 | **Approved** |
| C002 | TRUE | None | 720 | 720 | Approved |
| C003 | FALSE | None | 715 | 715 | **Rejected** |
| C004 | TRUE | Highland Civic Darts Club | 690 | 700 | **Approved** |
| C005 | FALSE | None | 740 | 740 | Approved |

This single adjustment has **material, outcome-determining consequences** that become clear through direct comparison.

## 2. The Most Revealing Comparisons

### Case C003 vs. Case C004: The Critical Inequity

This pairing most starkly exposes the bias:

- **C003**: Non-local, no community group, raw score of **715**  **Rejected**
- **C004**: Local resident, Darts Club member, raw score of **690**  **Approved** (boosted to 700)

C003 has a **25-point higher underlying creditworthiness score** than C004, yet C004 is approved and C003 is rejected. The individual in C003 is, by every objective measure captured in the preliminary scoring, a stronger applicant. The outcome is reversed entirely because of a social club membership.

### Case C001 vs. Case C002: Invisible Advantage

- **C001**: Darts Club member, raw score **710**  boosted to 720  Approved
- **C002**: No affiliation, raw score **720**  stays at 720  Approved

Both are approved, so the bias is invisible in outcomes here — but C001 reached the approval threshold **only because of the adjustment**. Without it, at 710, C001's outcome may have differed, while C002 earned approval through creditworthiness alone.

## 3. Which Attributes Drive the Bias

### A. Community Group Membership
The +10 adjustment is explicitly labeled "(Community)" and tied to a **specific named social organization**. This raises serious concerns:

- Membership in the Highland Civic Darts Club is likely correlated with **socioeconomic status, social networks, geography, and potentially age, ethnicity, or class** — none of which are legitimate creditworthiness factors
- The club may be **geographically or culturally concentrated**, meaning the benefit flows disproportionately to people who are already relatively advantaged or socially connected
- There is no documented rationale for why *this* club membership predicts creditworthiness — it appears to function as a **proxy variable for social belonging**

### B. Local Residency (LocalResident = TRUE/FALSE)
While local residency does not trigger an explicit score adjustment, the pattern in the data is suggestive:

- All non-local residents (C003, C005) have **no community group affiliation** and receive no adjustments
- The only approved non-local case (C005) required a score of **740** — substantially higher than local residents who were approved at adjusted scores of 700–720
- This suggests non-locals face a **structurally higher effective threshold** to achieve approval, even if not through an explicit scoring rule

## 4. How the Bias Propagates Through the Process

The bias is not merely in the algorithm — it is **reinforced at every stage**:

```
PreliminaryScoring  +10 applied based on club membership
        
ManualReview  Reviewers see the already-adjusted score; 
               the adjustment is normalized, not questioned
        
FinalDecision  Rules Engine approves/rejects based on 
                a score that embeds the biased adjustment
```

Critically, **no reviewer appears to challenge the legitimacy of the community adjustment**. The manual review step, which should provide a human check on algorithmic bias, instead **launders the biased score** by treating it as a given input rather than scrutinizing it.

## 5. Fairness and Equity Implications

### Disparate Impact on Non-Affiliated Individuals
Applicants without community group ties face a hidden disadvantage that has nothing to do with their ability to repay a loan. This creates two classes of applicant:

- Those whose creditworthiness is evaluated **as-is**
- Those whose creditworthiness is **artificially inflated** through social capital proxies

### The Structural Exclusion Problem
Access to the Highland Civic Darts Club — like most civic associations — is unlikely to be uniformly distributed across the population. People who are:

- **New to an area** (mobile workers, immigrants, younger adults)
- **Working multiple jobs** with less leisure time
- **From cultural backgrounds** where this type of club is not common
- **Lower income** and unable to afford membership fees or social participation

...are systematically disadvantaged, not because they are less creditworthy, but because they lack access to the right social networks. **The process mistakes social embeddedness for financial reliability.**

### Reinforcement of Existing Privilege
People who are already well-connected, locally established, and socially integrated receive score boosts. This tends to benefit those who are **already advantaged**, compounding existing inequalities rather than assessing credit risk neutrally.

## 6. Summary of Bias Types Identified

| Bias Type | How It Appears |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Algorithmic bias** | Explicit +10 adjustment for club membership with no credit-relevant justification |
| **Proxy discrimination** | Club membership likely correlates with protected or sensitive characteristics |
| **Process laundering** | Manual review normalizes rather than challenges the adjustment |
| **Disparate threshold effect** | Non-locals/non-affiliated applicants require materially higher scores to achieve the same outcome |
| **Structural exclusion** | Benefit flows to those with access to specific social institutions |

## 7. Recommendations

1. **Remove the community group adjustment** unless a statistically validated, credit-relevant causal mechanism is documented and disclosed
2. **Audit outcomes by demographic group** to identify whether the adjustment correlates with race, national origin, age, or other protected classes
3. **Redesign manual review** to explicitly task reviewers with questioning score adjustments, not just confirming them
4. **Establish a clear approval threshold** that is applied uniformly, with any exceptions documented and justified on credit-relevant grounds
5. **Test for disparate impact** by comparing approval rates across local/non-local and affiliated/non-affiliated groups at equivalent raw score bands

The core principle at stake is that **creditworthiness assessment should measure an applicant's ability and likelihood to repay, not their social connections or geographic embeddedness**. When the process conflates these things, it produces decisions that are neither fair to individuals nor defensible as legitimate risk assessment.
