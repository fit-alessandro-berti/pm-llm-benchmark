Below is one way to revise and clarify the event log by renaming repeated activities. The goal was to use contextual clues—the event order, associated resources, and additional context—to differentiate when the same textual “activity” actually represents a distinct step in the process.


Revised Event Log:


Case C001:
• 09:15 – Initiate Request via Web Portal  
• (Original: Initiate Request – Customer submitted a request via online portal.)

• 09:20 – Initial Identity Document Review  
• (Original: Verify Documents – Agent checks identity documents. – Note: The first check.)

• 09:45 – Outbound Call to Request Missing Documents  
• (Original: Call Customer – Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs.)

• 10:10 – Customer Uploads Additional ID Scan  
• (Original: Submit Additional – Customer uploads the requested ID scan.)

• 10:30 – Reverification of Documents Following Upload  
• (Original: Verify Documents – Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided.)

• 10:45 – Final Approval of Request  
• (Original: Approve Request – Final approval given.)



Case C002:
• 08:05 – Initiate Request via Web Portal  
• (Original: Initiate Request – Customer submitted a request via online portal.)

• 08:15 – Initial Identity Verification  
• (Original: Verify Documents – Identity verification by BackOfficeAgent.)

• 09:00 – Outbound Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy  
• (Original: Call Customer – Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.)

• 09:30 – Internal Account Adjustment  
• (Original: Adjust Account – Adjust account details internally after call.)

• 09:50 – Follow-Up Call to Confirm Account Adjustments  
• (Original: Call Customer – Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made.)

• 10:05 – Final Approval of Request  
• (Original: Approve Request – Final approval given.)



Case C003:
• 11:20 – Initiate Request at Branch Reception  
• (Original: Initiate Request – Walk-in customer at branch.)

• 11:25 – On-Site Physical Identity Verification  
• (Original: Verify Documents – Physical verification of ID by BranchOfficer.)

• 11:50 – In-Branch Call to Retrieve Customer  
• (Original: Call Customer – Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return.)

• 12:05 – Internal Account Correction  
• (Original: Adjust Account – Internal correction due to missing info.)

• 12:20 – Reverification of Documents After Correction  
• (Original: Verify Documents – Re-verify docs after account adjustment.)

• 12:30 – Final Approval of Request  
• (Original: Approve Request – Final approval given.)


Justification of Naming Choices:
1. Initiate Request: We appended the channel (e.g., “via Web Portal” or “at Branch Reception”) to clarify the customer’s entry point.
2. Verify Documents: Since it occurs more than once, we distinguished the initial review (“Initial Identity Document Review” or “Initial Identity Verification”/“On-Site Physical Identity Verification”) from the subsequent check after new information (“Reverification of Documents Following Upload” or “Reverification of Documents After Correction”).
3. Call Customer: The calls had different purposes. In some cases, the call is to request additional documents (“Outbound Call to Request Missing Documents”), whereas in others it’s for clarifying issues or confirming changes (“Outbound Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy” and “Follow-Up Call to Confirm Account Adjustments” or “In-Branch Call to Retrieve Customer”).
4. Adjust Account: The naming “Internal Account Adjustment” or “Internal Account Correction” clarifies that this activity is an internal process change triggered by prior events.
5. Submit Additional: Renamed as “Customer Uploads Additional ID Scan” to emphasize the customer action.
6. Approve Request: Since this activity is a final step, “Final Approval of Request” is used consistently.

These changes help disambiguate repeated activity names by providing context on the timing, purpose, and channel of each activity as it appears in the overall support workflow.
