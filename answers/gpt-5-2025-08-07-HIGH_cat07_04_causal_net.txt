It’s a workflow/process model for handling a request, drawn with tasks (rounded rectangles) and controlflow connectors (small black dots). The legend at the bottom right shows what the connectors mean: XOR-, AND-, and OR-splits/joins.

Main flow
- a: register request (start).
- The case goes to the investigation phase: b (examine thoroughly) or c (examine casually), and d (check ticket). According to the connectors, these can be taken alternatively and/or in parallel, then synchronized.
- e: decide.
- From the decision there’s a choice: g (pay compensation) or h (reject request).
- Both lead to z: end.
- f: reinitiate request is a rework loop that sends the case back to the examination/check steps (b/c/d) before another decision.

Overall, it’s a controlflow diagram (Petrinet/YAWL/Cnet style) showing routing via XOR/AND/OR gateways and a rework loop.
