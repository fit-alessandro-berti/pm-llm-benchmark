### Analysis of Insurance Claims Processing Event Log

#### Step 1: Identify Cases with Long Durations
To identify performance issues, we calculate the **lead time** (duration from first event to last event) for each case:

| Case ID | First Event (Submit)      | Last Event (Close)         | Duration (hours) | Notes                          |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00          | 2024-04-01 10:30          | 1.5              | Shortest duration              |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05          | 2024-04-02 11:00          | 25.9             | **Long** (1 day delay)        |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10          | 2024-04-03 09:30          | 48.3             | **Long** (2-day delay)        |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20          | 2024-04-01 10:45          | 1.4              | Short duration                |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25          | 2024-04-04 14:30          | 77.1             | **Longest** (3-day delay)     |

**Cases with Performance Issues**:  
- **2002** (25.9 hours), **2003** (48.3 hours), and **2005** (77.1 hours) take **significantly longer** than the baseline cases (2001 and 2004, both under 1.5 hours).  
- **Severity**: 2005 is the worst (3+ days), followed by 2003 (2 days), and 2002 (1 day).

#### Step 2: Analyze Attributes for Root Causes
We examine **Resource**, **Region**, and **Complexity** for patterns in long cases:

##### A. **Complexity Impact**
- **Low complexity** (Cases 2001, 2004):  
  - No "Request Additional Documents" events.  
  - Direct flow: Submit  Evaluate  Approve  Pay  Close.  
  - **Duration**: ~1.5 hours (fast).  
- **Medium complexity** (Case 2002):  
  - **1 "Request Additional Documents"** event.  
  - **Delay**: 25.9 hours.  
- **High complexity** (Cases 2003, 2005):  
  - **Multiple "Request Additional Documents"** events:  
    - Case 2003: **2 requests** (duration: 48.3 hours).  
    - Case 2005: **3 requests** (duration: 77.1 hours).  
  - **Correlation**: Higher complexity  more document requests  longer delays.  

**Insight**:  
- **Document requests are the primary bottleneck**. Each request adds significant delays (e.g., gaps between requests in 2005: 29.5 hours and 22 hours).  
- High-complexity claims suffer from **fragmented document collection**, extending the process.

---

##### B. **Region Impact**
- **Region A** (Cases 2001, 2003):  
  - Case 2001 (Low): 1.5 hours (fast).  
  - Case 2003 (High): 48.3 hours (slow).  
- **Region B** (Cases 2002, 2004, 2005):  
  - Case 2004 (Low): 1.4 hours (fast).  
  - Case 2002 (Medium): 25.9 hours (slow).  
  - Case 2005 (High): 77.1 hours (slowest).  

**Insight**:  
- **Region B has worse performance** for non-low-complexity claims:  
  - Medium complexity (2002) in Region B: 25.9 hours.  
  - High complexity (2005) in Region B: 77.1 hours (vs. 48.3 hours for similar complexity in Region A).  
- **Possible causes**:  
  - Resource inefficiencies in Region B (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa handles both medium/high cases).  
  - Localized process differences (e.g., stricter document requirements).

---

##### C. **Resource Impact**
- **Adjuster_Mike** (Region A):  
  - Case 2001 (Low): Fast (no delays).  
  - Case 2003 (High): 2 document requests but shorter gaps (6 hours between requests).  
- **Adjuster_Lisa** (Region B):  
  - Case 2004 (Low): Fast (no delays).  
  - Case 2002 (Medium): 1 request (25.9 hours total).  
  - Case 2005 (High): **3 requests** with **long gaps** (29.5 and 22 hours between requests).  

**Insight**:  
- **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) is a bottleneck**:  
  - Handles more complex claims (2002, 2005) but with **longer response times** between document requests.  
  - Case 2005 took 29.5 hours between first and second request (vs. 6 hours for Adjuster_Mike in 2003).  
- **Manager_Bill** (Approver for 2003/2005):  
  - No direct delays, but relies on timely document submission (which is delayed upstream).

#### Step 3: Root Cause Synthesis
| Root Cause                          | Evidence                                                                 | Impact on Duration |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **High Complexity**                 | Cases 2003/2005 had 2-3 document requests vs. 0-1 in others.            | +40–75 hours     |
| **Region B Inefficiencies**         | Region B’s medium/high cases (2002/2005) took longer than similar cases in Region A. | +20–30 hours     |
| **Adjuster_Lisa’s Performance**     | Long gaps (29.5 hours) between document requests in Case 2005.           | +30–50 hours     |
| **Document Request Delays**         | Gaps between requests (e.g., 22–29.5 hours in 2005) due to slow responses. | +20–50 hours     |

**Key Drivers**:  
1. **Document requests** are the single largest delay source, especially for high-complexity claims.  
2. **Region B** has systemic delays, compounded by **Adjuster_Lisa’s slow handling** of documents.  
3. **High complexity** amplifies delays due to iterative document collection.

#### Step 4: Recommendations for Mitigation
1. **Optimize Document Handling**:  
   - Implement **automated reminders** for customers to submit documents faster.  
   - Use **document checklists** during submission to reduce re-requests (e.g., for high-complexity claims).  
   - **Target**: Reduce gaps between requests by 50%.

2. **Address Resource-Specific Issues**:  
   - **Retrain Adjuster_Lisa**: Focus on efficient document collection and gap reduction.  
   - **Redistribute workload**: Assign high-complexity claims in Region B to multiple adjusters (e.g., share with Adjuster_Mike).  
   - **Target**: Reduce Adjuster_Lisa’s average gap between requests to <12 hours.

3. **Region-Specific Process Review**:  
   - **Audit Region B’s procedures**: Identify why document requests take longer (e.g., local regulations, customer communication gaps).  
   - **Standardize complexity thresholds**: Ensure "High" complexity is defined consistently across regions.  
   - **Target**: Align Region B’s performance with Region A.

4. **Proactive Complexity Management**:  
   - **Early intervention flag**: Trigger dedicated support for high-complexity claims during "Evaluate Claim" stage.  
   - **Specialized team**: Assign senior adjusters to high-complexity cases to minimize iterative requests.  
   - **Target**: Reduce document requests for high-complexity claims from 3 to 1–2.

### Summary
- **Problem Cases**: 2002, 2003, 2005 (durations 25–77 hours vs. baseline 1.5 hours).  
- **Root Causes**:  
  - High complexity  excessive document requests.  
  - Region B inefficiencies + slow handling by Adjuster_Lisa.  
- **Solution**: Optimize document workflows, retrain/redistribute resources, and standardize processes.  
- **Expected Outcome**: Reduce high-complexity claim durations by 40–60% and eliminate Region B-specific delays.
