Certainly! The data outlines a complex process for managing declarations and payments within an organization. The process involves multiple stages and approvals from different roles such as Employee, Supervisor, Administration, Pre-Approver, and Budget Owner. Here’s a general description of the process based on the data provided:

### Main Process Flows

1. **Declaration Submission:**
   - **Initial Submission:** The process starts with the declaration being submitted by an employee (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

2. **Approval Pathways:**
   - **Direct Supervisor Approval:** In some cases, the declaration goes directly to the supervisor for final approval (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
   - **Administrative Approval:** Often, the declaration is first reviewed and approved by the administration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`).
     - **Further Approval Required:** The administration may either:
       - Forward it to a budget owner for approval (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
       - Approve it themselves and forward it to the supervisor for final approval (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).

3. **Payment Request:**
   - Once the declaration is finally approved by the supervisor, a payment request is made (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment`).
   - The payment is then handled (`Request Payment -> Payment Handled`).

### Rejection and Re-submission:

1. **Rejection Cycles:**
   - Rejection can happen at multiple stages:
     - By the supervisor (`Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`).
     - By the administration (`Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`).
     - By the pre-approver (`Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`).
     - By the budget owner (`Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`).
   
   - Rejected declarations are often resubmitted, starting the process over again (`Declaration REJECTED by [Role] -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).
   - Additionally, declarations can be rejected back to the employee (`Declaration REJECTED by [Role] -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`).

2. **Cycle Time and Frequency:**
   - The performance (cycle time) and frequency data provide insights into how often each step occurs and how long it takes.

### Special Cases and Low-Frequency Events:

- There are lower-frequency paths and special cases within the process:
  - **Special Approval Stages:** Intermediate stages where the declaration goes through a pre-approver (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`).
  - **Payments Directly from Rejections:** Request payments initiated even from rejected states (rare and outliers).

### Anomalies/Missing Data:

- **MISSING Steps:** Instances where the role is listed as "MISSING," indicative of possible data entry issues or unknown steps in some parts of the process (`Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`).

### Summary:

In essence, the process revolves around an employee submitting a declaration that undergoes various approval stages. The main goal is to either approve the declaration, leading to a payment request, or reject it with possible re-submission by the employee. The performance metrics indicate significant variability in the time it takes for different approvals, highlighting potential areas for efficiency improvements.

This process ensures that declarations undergo thorough scrutiny, but also indicates areas with bottlenecks, particularly where multiple approvals are required or high rejection frequencies are noted.
