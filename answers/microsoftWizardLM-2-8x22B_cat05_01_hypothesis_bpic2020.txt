 Certainly! Here are 20 relevant questions about the process, along with confidence scores that reflect the level of insight each question might provide based on the data:

1. **What is the total frequency of all payment-related processes?** (Confidence: 95%)
   - This question aims to aggregate all instances where a payment was handled to understand the overall volume.

2. **What is the total performance value of all completed payment processes?** (Confidence: 95%)
   - This question seeks to sum up the monetary value of all finalized payments to gauge financial throughput.

3. **Which approval step has the highest rejection rate by frequency?** (Confidence: 90%)
   - This question focuses on identifying the bottleneck in the approval process by comparing rejection frequencies at each step.

4. **Which approver (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER) is associated with the highest performance value in approvals?** (Confidence: 85%)
   - This question aims to determine which approver's decisions have the most significant financial impact.

5. **How many times on average does an employee have to resubmit a declaration before it is finally approved and paid?** (Confidence: 80%)
   - This question attempts to quantify the average number of resubmissions due to rejections, indicating process inefficiency.

6. **What is the average performance value of a declaration that has been rejected at least once before approval?** (Confidence: 75%)
   - This question compares the financial value of declarations that faced obstacles versus those that did not.

7. **What proportion of declarations are approved without any rejections?** (Confidence: 80%)
   - This question seeks to measure the efficiency of the initial submission and approval process.

8. **What is the frequency of the most common process variant from submission to payment handling?** (Confidence: 90%)
   - This question identifies the prevailing workflow path in the process.

9. **Which process variant has the highest average performance value?** (Confidence: 85%)
   - This question aims to find the most financially significant process flow.

10. **What is the average performance value of all payment processes that included a rejection?** (Confidence: 80%)
    - This question investigates the financial impact of rejections in the process.

11. **How does the frequency of rejections by the SUPERVISOR compare to that of other approvers?** (Confidence: 85%)
    - This question benchmarks the SUPERVISOR's rejection rate against others in the process.

12. **What is the impact of rejections on the overall performance value of the process?** (Confidence: 80%)
    - This question assesses the financial toll of the rejection process.

13. **How many unique process variants lead to a successful payment?** (Confidence: 90%)
    - This question categorizes the diversity of paths to success within the process.

14. **What is the average number of steps in a process variant that leads to a payment?** (Confidence: 85%)
    - This question quantifies the complexity of the process for successful outcomes.

15. **Do declarations with higher performance values face more rejections?** (Confidence: 75%)
    - This question explores a potential correlation between the financial value of a declaration and its likelihood of being rejected.

16. **What is the frequency of declarations that are submitted but never result in a payment?** (Confidence: 90%)
    - This question identifies the rate of abandonment or failure in the process.

17. **How often do employees resubmit after a rejection by the ADMINISTRATION compared to other approvers?** (Confidence: 85%)
    - This question examines the resilience of employees and the stringency of the ADMINISTRATION's approval criteria.

18. **What is the average performance value of processes that involve the BUDGET OWNER's approval?** (Confidence: 80%)
    - This question evaluates the financial significance of the BUDGET OWNER's role in the process.

19. **How does the performance value of the 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' variant compare to the average performance value of completed payment processes?** (Confidence: 75%)
    - This question contrasts the financial impact of incomplete versus complete process variants.

20. **What percentage of the total performance value is attributed to process variants that include a 'FINAL_APPROVED' step?** (Confidence: 85%)
    - This question measures the financial weight of the final approval step in the overall process.

The confidence scores are based on the assumption that the data provided is accurate and complete. They also consider the complexity of the analysis required to answer each question. Questions that require straightforward aggregations or comparisons have higher confidence scores, while those that involve more complex correlations or interpretations have slightly lower scores.
