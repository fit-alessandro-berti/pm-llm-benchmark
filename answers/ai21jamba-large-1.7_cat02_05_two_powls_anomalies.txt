### Analysis of POWL Models

#### **POWL Model 1 Analysis**

This model includes the following sequence of activities and their partial orders:

1. `Post_Job_Ad` (Post)  `Screen_Candidates` (Screen)
2. `Screen_Candidates`  `Make_Hiring_Decision` (Decide)
3. `Screen_Candidates`  `Conduct_Interviews` (Interview)
4. `Make_Hiring_Decision`  `Onboard_Employee` (Onboard)
5. `Onboard_Employee`  `Add_to_Payroll` (Payroll)
6. `Add_to_Payroll`  `Close_Case` (Close)

#### **Anomalies in Model 1**

1. **Parallel Screening and Interviewing:**
	- The activity `Screen_Candidates` is ordered before `Make_Hiring_Decision` but is also partially ordered with `Conduct_Interviews`. This implies that interviews could potentially occur before screening decisions are finalized, which deviates from the standard order of conducting interviews only after candidates are screened.
2. **Flexibility Over Completeness:**
	- The partial order allows for the possibility of `Screen_Candidates` occurring without directly enforcing an interview. While not entirely incorrect, this flexibility could result in less comprehensive candidate evaluation.
3. **Make_Hiring_Decision Early:**
	- The hiring decision (`Decide`) can be made immediately after screening, which might omit critical information from interviews, creating a potential risk in the decision-making process.

#### **POWL Model 2 Analysis**

This model includes the following structure and orders:

1. `Post_Job_Ad` (Post)  `Screen_Candidates` (Screen)
2. `Post_Job_Ad`  `Conduct_Interviews` (Interview)
3. `Interview`  `Make_Hiring_Decision` (Decide)
4. `Make_Hiring_Decision`  `Onboard_Employee` with a loop `*[Onboard, skip]`
5. The loop leads to either `xor_payroll` (exclusive choice between `Add_to_Payroll` or `skip`)
6. Finally, `xor_payroll`  `Close_Case` (Close).

#### **Anomalies in Model 2**

1. **Onboarding Loop:**
	- The loop `*[Onboard, skip]` implies that onboarding could repeat unnecessarily. This introduces inefficiency and may violate process logic, as onboarding is typically a one-time activity.
2. **Optional Payroll Addition:**
	- The exclusive choice `xor_payroll` allows for skipping the addition of an employee to payroll (`Add_to_Payroll`), which fundamentally violates the integrity of the process, as employees must be added to the payroll before closing the case.
3. **Interviewing Without Screening:**
	- `Post_Job_Ad` directly leads to `Conduct_Interviews` without requiring screening, which undermines the standard procedure of filtering candidates before interviewing.
4. **Potential for Disconnected Actions:**
	- The structure of Model 2 introduces unnecessary complexity, especially with `skip` silent transitions, which might lead to workflow ambiguities and inefficiencies.

### **Comparison and Conclusion**

#### **Model 1 Analysis**

1. The main anomaly in Model 1 is flexibility allowing interviews before or in parallel with screening. This is less severe because screening and interviews are still logically related.
2. The earlier decision-making might lead to incomplete evaluation, but it does not fundamentally violate the workflow.

#### **Model 2 Analysis**

1. The onboarding loop introduces inefficiency.
2. The optional payroll addition is a severe anomaly, as skipping payroll addition is unacceptable in any normative Hire-to-Retire process.
3. Interviewing without prior screening undermines the candidate selection process, leading to potential inefficiencies or faulty hiring decisions.

#### **Conclusion**

**Model 1** more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process, as its anomalies are less severe and allow for corrective measures. In contrast, **Model 2** introduces critical deviations (e.g., optional payroll addition, unnecessary loop) that severely affect process correctness and integrity.
