 Process mining is a discipline that sits at the intersection of data science and process management, and it involves the analysis of business processes based on event logs. The primary goal of process mining is to improve processes by extracting insights and identifying opportunities for optimization from the actual execution data of these processes. There are three main areas within process mining: process discovery, conformance checking, and process enhancement (or enhancement). Let's explore each of these and then focus on process enhancement.

1. **Process Discovery**:
   Process discovery is the task of automatically constructing a process model that describes the observed behavior recorded in an event log. The goal is to create a model that generalizes the behavior in the event log and abstracts from infrequent or spurious behavior. This model can be used to understand how a process operates and to communicate the process structure to stakeholders. Common techniques used in process discovery include the generation of Petri nets, BPMN diagrams, or other types of process maps.

2. **Conformance Checking**:
   Conformance checking involves comparing the actual process execution, as recorded in an event log, with the normative (prescriptive) process model to detect deviations. This is crucial for auditing purposes and for ensuring compliance with laws, regulations, or standards. Conformance checking can reveal non-conformance issues such as missing steps, activities performed in the wrong order, or execution of forbidden paths. It helps organizations maintain the integrity of their processes and identify areas where corrective actions are needed.

3. **Process Enhancement (Enhancement)**:
   Process enhancement (sometimes referred to as process improvement or enhancement) builds upon the insights gained from process discovery and conformance checking to propose changes to a process for the purpose of optimizing it. The goal is to make the process more efficient, effective, or flexible. Unlike process discovery, which focuses on understanding the as-is process, process enhancement seeks to create a to-be process model. This involves analyzing bottlenecks, rework cycles, deviations, and performance metrics to suggest improvements. Process enhancement can be prescriptive, suggesting specific changes to the process, or it can be explorative, providing insights that enable process owners to make informed decisions about potential changes.

Process enhancement differs from process discovery and conformance checking in the following ways:
