### **Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process Description**

We are given a **normative process description** that defines the **correct sequence of activities** for handling orders. We are also given an **event log** that records the **actual sequence of activities** for multiple cases. Our task is to **identify which cases deviate from the normative process** and **explain the violations**.

---

## **1. Identify Cases That Violate the Normative Process**

### **Case 1**  **Valid**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
- **Analysis:** This case follows the correct flow for a situation where **inventory is sufficient**. All required steps are in the correct order, and **no violations** are observed.

### **Case 2**  **Invalid**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  **Package  Authorize  Ship  Close**
- **Violation:** **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"**.
  - According to the normative process:  
    > "Package items" should only occur **after authorization** and **before shipping**.
  - **This case violates the rule** that **authorization must occur before packaging**.
  - **Also, "Ship order" occurs after "Authorize payment"**, which is acceptable, but the **order of packaging and authorization is incorrect**.

### **Case 3**  **Invalid**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Authorize  **Cancel  Ship  Close**
- **Violation 1:** **"Cancel order" occurs before "Package items"**, but **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel"**.
  - According to the normative process:  
    > Once an order is **canceled**, it is **illogical** to continue with **activities intended for fulfillment** (such as **shipping**).
  - **"Ship order" should not occur after "Cancel order"**.
- **Violation 2:** **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"**, which is explicitly **not allowed** in the normative process.
  - This is a **clear violation** of the rule:  
    > "Ship order" should **only occur after packaging** and **never after a cancellation**.

### **Case 4**  **Valid**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
- **Analysis:** This is the **correct sequence** for a **cancellation scenario**.  
  - After checking inventory and determining it is insufficient, the process proceeds directly to **Cancel order**, then **Close order**.
  - No violations are observed.

### **Case 5**  **Invalid**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship  Close**
- **Violation:** **"Ship order" occurs before "Package items"**.
  - According to the normative process:  
    > "Ship order" should only occur **after packaging**.
  - **This case skips the "Package items" activity**, which is required before **shipping**.
  - This is a **clear violation** of the rule:  
    > "Ship order" should only occur **after packaging**.

## **2. Summary of Violations and Explanations**

| Case ID | Violation Description | Rule Violated | Explanation |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **2** | "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment" | Authorization must occur before packaging | The normative process requires that **payment be authorized before items are packaged**. |
| **3** | "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order" | Shipping should not occur after cancellation | Once an order is canceled, **fulfillment activities like shipping should not proceed**. |
| **5** | "Ship order" occurs before "Package items" | Shipping must occur after packaging | **Items must be packaged before shipping**. Skipping this step is a clear violation. |

## **Conclusion**

- **Case 2, 3, and 5** are **invalid** based on the normative process description.
- **Case 1 and 4** follow the correct sequence as described.
- The violations stem from **incorrect ordering of activities** and **proceeding with fulfillment steps after cancellation**, which are explicitly disallowed in the normative process.
