### Explanation of Added Constraints:

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - Added `"Approve_Minority"` and `"Reject_Minority"` to coexist with `"ManualReview"`. This ensures that any decision involving a sensitive demographic (e.g., minority applicants) is always accompanied by a manual review, promoting fairness and reducing bias.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - Added `"CheckApplicantRace"`, `"CheckApplicantGender"`, and `"CheckApplicantAge"` to respond to `"BiasMitigationCheck"`. This ensures that whenever a sensitive attribute is checked, a bias mitigation check must follow, preventing decisions based solely on sensitive attributes.

3. **Precedence and Succession Constraints:**
   - Added `"BiasMitigationCheck"` to precede and succeed `"Approve"` and `"Reject"`. This ensures that no decision is made without first performing a bias mitigation check, further reducing the risk of biased outcomes.

4. **Non-coexistence and Non-succession Constraints:**
   - Added `"CheckApplicantRace"`, `"CheckApplicantGender"`, and `"CheckApplicantAge"` to non-coexist and non-succeed with `"Reject"`. This prevents direct and immediate biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes, ensuring that decisions are not influenced by discriminatory factors.

These constraints collectively ensure that the loan application process is fair, consistent, and free from bias based on sensitive attributes.
