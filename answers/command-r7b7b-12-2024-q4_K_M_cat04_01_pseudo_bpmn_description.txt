The provided pseudo-BPMN diagram illustrates a business process for handling customer requests, categorizing them as either "Standard" or "Custom," and managing different workflows accordingly. Here's a detailed explanation of each step:

**1. Start Event:** The process begins with a "Start Event" which is the entry point to the defined workflow. It signifies that the system is ready to receive customer requests and initiate the respective processes based on their type.

**2. Task A: "Receive Customer Request":** This task represents the initial step of accepting and processing incoming customer requests. Once a request is received, it sets the stage for further analysis and processing as per the request's type.

**3. Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type:** The XOR (Exclusive OR) gateway evaluates whether the customer request is "Standard" or "Custom." This branching point determines which subsequent path to take, indicating that these two types of requests follow distinct workflows.

- **Standard Path:** If the request type is Standard, the process proceeds as follows:
   - Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation": This task involves validating the standard request against predefined rules and criteria. It ensures that all necessary checks are met before proceeding further.
   - Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks": The AND gateway indicates a point where multiple tasks can be executed in parallel, indicating simultaneous execution of tasks C1 ("Credit Check") and C2 ("Inventory Check"). These checks provide additional validation and verification for the standard request.
   - Task C1 and Task C2: These tasks represent specific parallel checks performed on creditworthiness and inventory availability, respectively, to ensure that the customer's standard request aligns with organizational policies.
   - Gateway (XOR): "All Parallel Checks Completed" acts as a join point, where all the parallel tasks are completed before proceeding. It ensures that all checks are successful before moving forward.
   - Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date": This task calculates and determines the expected delivery date based on the validated standard request.

- **Custom Path:** If the request type is Custom, the process follows a different path:
   - Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis": This step assesses whether customization is feasible for the customer's unique request. It requires understanding the specific requirements and checking if they can be accommodated within the organization's capabilities.
   - Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?": This gateway evaluates the feasibility of customization based on the analysis in Task B2.

- **Approval-based Workflow:** The custom path also includes an approval process:
   - If customization is feasible, it proceeds to Task E1 ("Prepare Custom Quotation").
   - If not, Task E2 ("Send Rejection Notice") triggers, and a rejection notice is sent back to the customer, ending the request processing.

**4. Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?":** This gateway determines whether approval from a manager or supervisor is required after processing either the standard or custom path tasks. It can be triggered if additional checks or exceptions are identified during the workflow.

- **Approval Process:**
   - If approval is needed, Task F ("Obtain Manager Approval") requests manager input and evaluation.
   - Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?": This gateway assesses whether the manager's approval was granted.
   - If approved, the process continues to Task G ("Generate Final Invoice"), indicating successful completion of all required checks and approvals.
   - If not approved, Task H ("Re-evaluate Conditions") prompts a re-evaluation of the request, potentially involving loopback to earlier tasks for further scrutiny or requesting additional information.

**5. Tasks G and I:** These tasks represent generating the final invoice and sending confirmation to the customer, respectively. Task G ensures that all necessary documentation is created, while Task I provides a response to the customer, indicating their request has been processed and approved (in case of standard requests) or feasibility assessed (for custom requests).

**Approvals and Rework:** Approvals are crucial in this process as they ensure that certain steps are validated by higher-level stakeholders before proceeding further. The rework step (Task H) allows for revisiting earlier tasks if conditions change, ensuring that the process can adapt to unforeseen circumstances or errors. This loopback mechanism prevents finalization of requests until all critical checks and approvals are met.

The diagram effectively illustrates how different request types trigger separate workflows, with parallel checks and approval processes in place to ensure accuracy and feasibility before generating final invoices and confirming customer requests.
