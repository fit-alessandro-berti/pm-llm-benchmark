To model the given manufacturing process as a POWL structure, we consider the following elements based on the event logs:

1. **Sequential Initial Steps**: Order Received (OR) → Material Sourcing (MS) → Quality Screening (QS).
2. **Assembly (AS) and In-line Quality Check (IQC) Loop**: After QS, execute AS, then either exit to Testing (TST) or repeat IQC followed by AS.
3. **Testing (TST) and Re-Testing (RT) Loop**: After AS-IQC loop, execute TST, then either exit to Packaging (PK) or repeat RT followed by TST.
4. **Optional Labeling (LB)**: After PK, choose between LB or skipping it (silent transition).
5. **Final Steps**: Distribution Planning (DP) → Dispatch (D).

**POWL Model Code:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities as transitions
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Initial sequence: OR → MS → QS
initial_sequence = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS])
initial_sequence.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
initial_sequence.order.add_edge(MS, QS)

# Loop between AS and IQC: * (AS, IQC)
as_iqc_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])

# Loop between TST and RT: * (TST, RT)
tst_rt_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Choice between LB and skip after PK
lb_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

# Root partial order defining the overall process flow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[initial_sequence, as_iqc_loop, tst_rt_loop, PK, lb_choice, DP, D])

# Add dependencies to enforce the sequence
root.order.add_edge(initial_sequence, as_iqc_loop)
root.order.add_edge(as_iqc_loop, tst_rt_loop)
root.order.add_edge(tst_rt_loop, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, lb_choice)
root.order.add_edge(lb_choice, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Sequence**: `OR → MS → QS` is modeled as a `StrictPartialOrder` enforcing sequential execution.
- **AS-IQC Loop**: The loop `* (AS, IQC)` allows repeating AS after IQC if quality checks fail.
- **TST-RT Loop**: The loop `* (TST, RT)` handles retesting until the product passes.
- **Optional LB**: An XOR choice after PK allows skipping labeling.
- **Final Steps**: DP and D are strictly sequential after LB choice.

This POWL model captures concurrency where possible and uses operators to handle loops and choices observed in the event logs.
