Certainly! Here is an example of how you could implement a process tree for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using the pm4py library:
```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Create the root process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Create the activities
create_order = ProcessTree(label="Create Order", parent=root)
execute_purchase_request = ProcessTree(label="Execute Purchase Request", parent=root)
approve_order = ProcessTree(label="Approve Order", parent=root)
send_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Send Invoice", parent=root)
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay Invoice", parent=root)

# Create the subprocess trees
purchase_request_subprocess = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
purchase_request_subprocess.children.append(create_order)
purchase_request_subprocess.children.append(execute_purchase_request)
purchase_request_subprocess.children.append(approve_order)

# Add the subprocess trees as children to the root process tree
root.children.append(purchase_request_subprocess)
root.children.append(send_invoice)
root.children.append(pay_invoice)
```

This code creates a process tree with the following structure:
* The root process tree is a parallel split.
* The first child of the root process tree is a subprocess tree that represents the process of creating a purchase order, executing a purchase request, and approving the order.
* The second child of the root process tree is the process of sending an invoice.
* The third child of the root process tree is the process of paying an invoice.
This process tree represents the Purchase-to-Pay process in which a purchase order is created, a purchase request is executed, an order is approved, an invoice is sent, and the invoice is paid.
