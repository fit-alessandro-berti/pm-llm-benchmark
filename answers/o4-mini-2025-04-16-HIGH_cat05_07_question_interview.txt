1. Can you walk me through the typical timeline from the moment a landlord first contacts your regional office to the point the property is activated in your rental portal?  
2. How do you track and enforce deadlines or SLAs for each stage of the onboarding process (e.g., document collection, inspection, marketing)?  
3. What specific criteria do you use to determine whether a landlord’s documentation is complete and up to date, and how do you handle borderline cases or disputes over regulatory requirements?  
4. How are property details standardized and entered into your central database—do you use predefined templates or fields, and who is ultimately responsible for data accuracy?  
5. When assigning a property manager, how do you weigh factors like workload, geographic coverage, and specialty experience? Is there a formal scoring system or is it a manual decision?  
6. What does the introductory meeting between the property manager and landlord typically cover, and how do you document any special conditions or custom agreements arising from that conversation?  
7. Can you describe the scheduling workflow for photographers and inspectors—who initiates it, how are timelines communicated, and what happens if availability conflicts arise?  
8. What standards or checklists do your inspectors follow, and how do you manage remediation and follow-up inspections if issues are uncovered?  
9. How is the marketing strategy for a new property developed? Who owns the pricing decision, what inputs feed into your pricing models, and how often are they updated?  
10. Once marketing materials are ready, what process or approvals must occur before the property goes live, and what system-generated notifications or handoffs ensure nothing is overlooked?  
11. How do you structure your tenant-screening criteria (credit score thresholds, income ratios, references, etc.), and what governance exists around those criteria to ensure consistency and fairness?  
12. In cases where multiple applicants meet your baseline criteria, how do you prioritize or compare them? Is there a formal ranking algorithm, or does the property manager decide case by case?  
13. What is your approach to negotiating lease terms—do you have standard templates with limited customization, and who signs off on any bespoke clauses?  
14. How do you coordinate the final lease signing, security deposit collection, and move-in scheduling across your teams, and what common pitfalls have you encountered?  
15. What quality-control checkpoints (e.g., compliance review, financial audit, IT system validation) occur post-lease signing, and who performs each audit?  
16. How do you handle exceptions—such as properties requiring special insurance, unusual lease clauses, or last-minute compliance issues—and what escalation paths are in place?  
17. Which internal or external stakeholders do you involve at each stage, how is communication tracked (email, CRM, project tool), and how do you ensure visibility across regions?  
18. Finally, what key performance indicators do you monitor to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of your property onboarding process, and how do you act on those insights?
