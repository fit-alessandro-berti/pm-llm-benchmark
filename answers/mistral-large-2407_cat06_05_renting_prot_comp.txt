Based on the provided process variants and their execution times, here are the main differences and potential unfair treatments between the protected and unprotected groups:

1. **Rejection Rate and Timing**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of early rejections (after viewing the property or even before setting an appointment). This could indicate unfair treatment if the reasons for rejection are not justified.
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of rejections after submitting and checking paperwork, which might indicate that they are given more chances to proceed with the application process.

2. **Extensive Screening**:
   - The protected group undergoes 'Extensive Screening' more frequently than the unprotected group. This could be a sign of unfair treatment if the extensive screening is not based on legitimate reasons.
   - The performance (execution time) for extensive screening is also higher for the protected group, suggesting that they might be subjected to more thorough or time-consuming screening processes.

3. **Tenancy Duration**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of longer tenancy durations (paying rent more times) before canceling the apartment. This could indicate that the protected group faces more difficulties in finding alternative housing or terminating their lease.

4. **Eviction**:
   - There are instances where the protected group misses rent payments, receives warnings, and eventually gets evicted. No such instances are present in the unprotected group's process variants, which could indicate unfair treatment or stricter policies applied to the protected group.

5. **Performance (Execution Time)**:
   - Generally, the performance (execution time) for similar processes is higher for the protected group. This could indicate that the protected group faces more delays or barriers in the application process and tenancy duration.

6. **Frequency of Successful Tenancies**:
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of successful tenancies (i.e., moving in and paying rent) compared to the protected group. This could indicate that the unprotected group has an easier time securing and maintaining tenancy.

These differences suggest potential unfair treatments of the protected group in the application process, screening, tenancy duration, and eviction policies. However, it's essential to investigate the reasons behind these differences to confirm if they result from unfair treatment or other factors.
