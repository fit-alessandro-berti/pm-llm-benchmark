Based on the declarative constraints provided, I will attempt to describe the process underlying this data. The process appears to be a business process related to expense declaration and approval. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Declaration**: The process starts with an employee declaring an expense (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`, or `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`).

2. **Pre-Approval**: The declared expense is then sent for pre-approval (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`).

3. **Pre-Approver Rejection**: If the pre-approver rejects the expense, it is sent back to the employee for revision (`Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`).

4. **Submission**: The employee submits the revised expense (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

5. **Budget Owner Approval**: The submitted expense is then sent to the budget owner for approval (`Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`).

6. **Final Approval**: If the budget owner approves the expense, it is then sent to the supervisor for final approval (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).

7. **Request Payment**: After final approval, a request for payment is generated (`Request Payment`).

8. **Payment Handling**: The payment is then handled (`Payment Handled`).

9. **Rejection**: If the expense is rejected at any stage, it is sent back to the employee with a rejection reason (`Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`, `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`, or `Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`).

10. **Approval by Admin**: If the expense is rejected by the supervisor, it can be approved by the admin (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`).

11. **Final Rejection**: If the expense is rejected at the final stage, it is considered final (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).

The process can also involve saved expenses (`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`), which can be submitted later.

Here are some additional insights:

* The process has multiple approval stages, with different approvers at each stage.
* There are multiple rejection stages, with different reasons for rejection.
* The process allows for multiple submissions and revisions of the expense.
* The process involves payment handling and final approval.
* The process has multiple constraints, including equivalence, always before, always after, never together, activity occurrences
