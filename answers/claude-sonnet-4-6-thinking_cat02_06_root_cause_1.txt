# Customer Support Ticket Resolution — Performance Analysis

---

## Step 1: Calculate Total Resolution Times

The total cycle time for each case is measured from **Receive Ticket** to **Close Ticket**.

| Case ID | Received           | Closed             | Total Duration  | Classification |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00   | 2024-03-01 10:15   | **2h 15min**    |  Normal      |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05   | 2024-03-02 09:15   | **~25h 10min**  |  Slow        |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10   | 2024-03-01 09:30   | **1h 20min**    |  Normal      |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20   | 2024-03-02 08:30   | **~24h 10min**  |  Slow        |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25   | 2024-03-03 09:30   | **~49h 5min**   |  Slowest     |

> **Baseline (fast cases):** Cases 101 and 103 average ~1h 47min  
> **Slow cases:** Cases 102, 104, and 105 average ~33 hours — roughly **18x longer** than the baseline

## Step 2: Granular Activity-Level Breakdown

Breaking each case into its inter-activity wait times reveals exactly where time is being lost.

### Case 101 —  2h 15min (Reference Baseline)
| Activity Transition                         | Wait Time |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Receive  Triage                            | 10 min    |
| Triage  Assign to Level-1                  | 10 min    |
| Assign  Investigate                        | 40 min    |
| Investigate  Resolve                       | 1h 00min  |
| Resolve  Close                             | 15 min    |

No escalations, no unusual gaps. Serves as the healthy benchmark.

### Case 103 —  1h 20min (Fastest)
| Activity Transition                         | Wait Time |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Receive  Triage                            | 5 min     |
| Triage  Assign to Level-1                  | 15 min    |
| Assign  Investigate                        | 15 min    |
| Investigate  Resolve                       | 30 min    |
| Resolve  Close                             | 15 min    |

Extremely efficient. No escalation, rapid handoffs at every stage.

### Case 102 —  ~25h 10min
| Activity Transition                              | Wait Time         |  Flag?          |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Receive  Triage                                 | 25 min            |                   |
| Triage  Assign to Level-1                       | 30 min            |                   |
| Assign  **Escalate to Level-2**                 | 2h 30min          |  Pre-escalation lag |
| Escalate  Investigate                           | 2h 30min          |  Level-2 pickup delay |
| Investigate  Resolve                            | **~19h 00min**    |  Overnight gap  |
| Resolve  Close                                  | 15 min            |                   |

**Key issues:** The Level-1 agent held the ticket for 2.5 hours before escalating. Then it took another 2.5 hours for the Level-2 team to begin investigation. Investigation starting at 14:00 meant resolution spilled into the next business day.

---

### Case 104 —  ~24h 10min
| Activity Transition                         | Wait Time         |  Flag?            |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Receive  Triage                            | 40 min            |  Slow triage      |
| Triage  Assign to Level-1                  | 30 min            |                     |
| Assign  Investigate                        | **3h 30min**      |  Major pre-investigation lag |
| Investigate  Resolve                       | **~19h 00min**    |  Overnight gap    |
| Resolve  Close                             | 30 min            |                     |

**Key issues:** No escalation occurred, yet this case took over 24 hours. The Level-1 agent waited 3.5 hours before beginning investigation. Similar to Case 102, investigation starting at 13:00 meant resolution couldn't happen until the next day.

### Case 105 —  ~49h 5min (Worst Performer)
| Activity Transition                              | Wait Time         |  Flag?             |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Receive  Triage                                 | 10 min            |                      |
| Triage  Assign to Level-1                       | 25 min            |                      |
| Assign  Investigate (Level-1)                   | 10 min            |                      |
| Investigate  Escalate to Level-2               | 50 min            |                      |
| **Escalate  Investigate (Level-2)**             | **~28h 00min**    |  Critical bottleneck |
| Investigate (Level-2)  Resolve                 | **~19h 00min**    |  Overnight gap     |
| Resolve  Close                                  | 30 min            |                      |

**Key issues:** The escalation on March 1 at 10:00 was not picked up by the Level-2 team until March 2 at 14:00 — a staggering **28-hour gap**. This alone accounts for more than half the total cycle time. Combined with another overnight resolution delay, the ticket spanned three calendar days.

---

## Step 3: Root Cause Analysis

Three distinct bottleneck patterns emerge across the slow cases:

---

###  Root Cause 1: Escalation Handling Delays
**Affects:** Cases 102, 105

Escalation to a Level-2 agent introduces significant queuing delays. In Case 102, the Level-2 team waited 2.5 hours to begin work. In Case 105, the delay was nearly 28 hours — spanning an entire off-hours period. This implies:

- **No SLA or time-bound ownership** exists for escalated tickets
- **Level-2 queues are not actively monitored**, especially across shift changes or overnight
- Escalation may be treated as a passive handoff rather than an urgent event requiring acknowledgment

---

###  Root Cause 2: Long Delays Before Investigation Begins
**Affects:** Cases 102 (2.5h), 104 (3.5h)

Even without escalation, Case 104 shows a 3.5-hour gap between assignment and the start of investigation. Possible causes:

- **Agent workload / multitasking:** Agents may be handling multiple tickets simultaneously, deferring investigation
- **Lack of priority enforcement:** No mechanism pushes agents to start work within a defined timeframe
- **Assignment  Active Work:** Tickets are formally assigned but sit idle in an agent's queue

---

###  Root Cause 3: Afternoon Investigations Spilling Overnight
**Affects:** Cases 102, 104, 105

In all three slow cases, investigation begins in the early-to-mid afternoon (13:00–14:00), and resolution does not occur until the following morning (~09:00). The ~19-hour pattern is consistent, strongly suggesting:

- **Investigations started after ~13:00 are not being completed same-day**, pointing to either complexity, end-of-shift cutoffs, or lack of urgency
- **No after-hours or on-call coverage** to bridge overnight gaps
- There may be a **handoff failure** — when an agent's shift ends, the ticket is not transferred to another active agent

---

## Step 4: Summary of Findings

| Root Cause                                      | Cases Affected   | Estimated Time Added     |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Escalation to Level-2 with long pickup delay    | 102, 105         | +2.5h to +28h            |
| Long idle time before investigation begins      | 102, 104, 105    | +2.5h to +3.5h           |
| Afternoon start  overnight resolution gap      | 102, 104, 105    | +~19h per occurrence     |
| Slow initial triage response                    | 104              | +40 min                  |

---

## Step 5: Recommendations

### 1. Enforce SLAs on Escalated Tickets
- Define a **maximum response time** (e.g., 30–60 minutes) for Level-2 agents to acknowledge and begin work on escalated tickets
- Implement **automated alerts** to supervisors when an escalated ticket exceeds the SLA threshold without a response

### 2. Set Time-Bound Investigation Start Rules
- Once a ticket is assigned, agents should be required to begin investigation within a defined window (e.g., 1 hour)
- A monitoring dashboard or queue management tool can flag tickets sitting unworked past the threshold

### 3. Introduce Shift Handoff Protocols for In-Progress Tickets
- Any ticket under active investigation at end-of-shift should be **formally handed off** to the next available agent with context notes
- This prevents the consistent ~19-hour overnight gaps observed across all three slow cases

### 4. Prioritize Escalation Tickets in Level-2 Queue
- Escalated tickets should be **auto-flagged as high priority** in the Level-2 queue, not simply appended to the bottom
- Consider dedicating a rotating Level-2 on-call agent during business hours to handle escalations promptly

### 5. Review and Reduce Unnecessary Escalations
- Case 102 was escalated after the Level-1 agent held it for 2.5 hours — it's worth examining whether this escalation was truly necessary or whether earlier Level-1 investigation might have resolved the issue
- Providing Level-1 agents with better knowledge base tools or decision support could reduce the escalation rate

---

## Conclusion

The primary drivers of delayed resolution are **escalation bottlenecks** (especially the 28-hour gap in Case 105), **idle time between assignment and investigation**, and a **systemic pattern of afternoon work carrying over to the next business day**. Cases 101 and 103 demonstrate that when tickets are handled promptly at each step with no escalation, resolution in under 2–3 hours is achievable. Closing the gap between these best-case and worst-case outcomes requires time-bound SLAs, active queue monitoring, and robust shift-handoff procedures.
