The visualization illustrates how a lab visit workflow interacts with lab testing through a modeling technique using socalled “proplets”.

**Part (a)** shows a detailed process diagram in which two proplet classes communicate via two channels.  
- On the left, the **Lab visit** class encompasses steps handled primarily by the doctor and lab assistants: ordering a test, taking a blood sample, judging the result, possibly repeating the tests, and finally sending a report.  
- On the right, the **Lab test** class describes responsibilities of the chemical analyst: performing the test, making a report, potentially repeating the test, and finishing the lab test.  
- Communication between the two classes is mediated through channels (e.g., the order system and HIS), shown as labeled arrows with interaction nodes, representing message exchanges such as “receive result,” “perform test,” “provide updated report,” etc.

**Part (b)** provides a simplified class diagram capturing how the Lab visit class is associated with the Lab test class (one lab visit requires one or more lab tests).

**Part (c)** supplies a tabular example of a “performative,” documenting one specific communication instance—at 11:00 a.m., the Lab visit class uses the Order system channel to send a “create” request to the Lab test class, asking, “Can you perform an HGB test for John?” This entry also notes the scope (private) and direction (outgoing).
