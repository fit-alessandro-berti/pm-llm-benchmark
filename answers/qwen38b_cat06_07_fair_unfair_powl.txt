<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. The first model should include a potential unfairness due to the community affiliation check, while the second model should eliminate that bias.

First, I need to recall the process steps as described. The hiring process has several stages: resume parsing with a loop for data completeness, skill assessment, then an XOR choice for cultural fit check. The XOR branch can lead to either a standard cultural fit evaluation or a CommunityAffiliationCheck that gives a subtle advantage. Then there's a managerial review and final decision.

So, for the first model (with potential unfairness), I need to create an XOR branch where one path is the standard cultural fit check, and the other is the CommunityAffiliationCheck. The presence of this XOR branch introduces the bias because the latter gives an advantage to certain applicants.

For the second model (without unfairness), I need to ensure that all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation. That means removing the XOR branch and having all applicants proceed through the standard cultural fit check. So, no separate CommunityAffiliationCheck activity, just the standard check.

Now, I need to structure these into POWL models. Let's start with the first model. The steps are:

1. Resume Parsing and Initial Data Check (with loop for data completeness)
2. Skill Assessment
3. XOR Choice: either Standard Cultural Fit Check or CommunityAffiliationCheck
4. Managerial Review
5. Final Decision

But wait, the loop is part of the resume parsing. So the initial step is the loop for data completeness. Then, the skill assessment. Then the XOR choice. Then the managerial review and final decision.

In POWL terms, the loop would be an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator. The XOR choice is an OperatorPOWL with XOR operator. The standard cultural fit check and CommunityAffiliationCheck are separate transitions. The managerial review and final decision are transitions as well.

So, for the first model:

- The loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Wait, the initial step is Resume Parsing, which may trigger a loop. The loop is handled by the DataCompletenessCheck activity, which might loop back if data is missing. So maybe the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and ResumeParsing?

Wait, the initial step is Resume Parsing. If the resume is incomplete, the applicant is asked to provide more info (RequestMoreInfo), which loops back to ResumeParsing. So the loop is between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo.

Then, after the loop, the SkillAssessment is done. Then the XOR choice between StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Wait, the description says that after the skill assessment, there's an XOR branching. So the sequence is:

ResumeParsing -> loop (DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo) -> SkillAssessment -> XOR choice (StandardCulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

So the XOR branch is part of the process after the skill assessment. So the first model's structure would have the XOR operator between the two cultural fit checks.

Now, the second model should not have the XOR branch. So after the skill assessment, all applicants go through the StandardCulturalFitCheck. So the XOR is replaced with a single path.

Now, building the POWL models. Let's outline the nodes for each model.

For the first model (with unfairness):

Nodes:
- ResumeParsing
- DataCompletenessCheck (loop)
- RequestMoreInfo
- SkillAssessment
- StandardCulturalFitCheck
- CommunityAffiliationCheck
- ManagerialReview
- FinalDecision

The loop is between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo, but how is that structured? The initial step is ResumeParsing, which may trigger DataCompletenessCheck. Wait, the initial step is ResumeParsing, and if data is incomplete, the system loops back to RequestMoreInfo. So the loop is between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo? Or is the DataCompletenessCheck part of the loop?

The original description says: "An automated system scans resumes for key qualifications... Any missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details before proceeding. If the resume is complete and structured correctly, the process continues."

So, the loop is: ResumeParsing -> DataCompletenessCheck (which checks for missing info). If missing, loop back to RequestMoreInfo. Wait, maybe the loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing? Or is the DataCompletenessCheck a loop condition?

This might require a loop between the DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo? Or perhaps the loop is between the ResumeParsing and RequestMore, but that's not clear. The example given in the problem's code snippet shows a loop between A and B. So in the first model, the loop is between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and ResumeParsing.

Alternatively, perhaps the loop is part of the DataCompletenessCheck. For example, the DataCompletenessCheck is a loop that checks if data is complete. If not, it loops back to request more info. But the exact structure is a bit ambiguous. The user's example code shows a loop between A and B. Let's assume that the loop is between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop is between ResumeParsing (which is the initial activity) and RequestMoreInfo. If the resume is incomplete, the system loops back to RequestMoreInfo, which then triggers another ResumeParsing.

But perhaps the loop is part of the DataCompletenessCheck. Maybe the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Let me think again.

The initial step is ResumeParsing. The system parses the resume. If there's missing data, it loops back to RequestMoreInfo. So the loop is between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop is structured as:

ResumeParsing -> DataCompletenessCheck (which checks if data is complete). If not, then loop to RequestMoreInfo, which then triggers ResumeParsing again. So the loop is between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo. But how is that represented in POWL?

Alternatively, the loop is an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Wait, the example code in the problem shows a loop between A and B. So perhaps the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo, which is a loop that checks data completeness and, if incomplete, loops back to RequestMoreInfo.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the loop is part of the resume parsing process. The initial activity is ResumeParsing, then DataCompletenessCheck. If data is incomplete, RequestMoreInfo is triggered, which loops back to ResumeParsing. So the loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing. So the loop is an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing.

But I need to make sure that the loop is properly modeled. For the first model, the loop is part of the resume parsing process, which may require a loop between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo.

Once the resume is complete, the process moves to SkillAssessment. Then, there's an XOR choice between StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. The presence of the CommunityAffiliationCheck introduces the bias.

For the second model, the XOR is replaced with a single path: after SkillAssessment, all applicants go through StandardCulturalFitCheck, so the XOR is replaced with a single transition.

Now, structuring the POWL models.

First model (with unfairness):

Nodes:

- ResumeParsing
- DataCompletenessCheck (part of the loop)
- RequestMoreInfo
- SkillAssessment
- StandardCulturalFitCheck
- CommunityAffiliationCheck
- ManagerialReview
- FinalDecision

The loop is between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo. Wait, the loop is triggered when data is incomplete. So after ResumeParsing, the DataCompletenessCheck is run. If incomplete, the loop triggers RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back to ResumeParsing. So the loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing. Therefore, the loop is an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing.

But perhaps the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. This is a bit unclear. Let's refer to the example in the problem's code. The example shows a loop between A and B. So in the first model, the loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing, which is a loop operator.

Then, after the loop, the process moves to SkillAssessment. Then, an XOR choice between StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So the first model's structure is:

[Loop between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing] -> SkillAssessment -> XOR (StandardCulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

Wait, but the loop is part of the resume parsing. So the initial steps are:

ResumeParsing -> DataCompletenessCheck (which may loop back to RequestMoreInfo). So the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo? Or is the loop between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo?

This is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to model it as follows:

The initial activity is ResumeParsing. Then, the DataCompletenessCheck is performed. If the data is incomplete, the system loops back to RequestMoreInfo, which then triggers ResumeParsing again. Therefore, the loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing, which is an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator between those two.

So in the first model, the loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing.

Then, after the loop, the process proceeds to SkillAssessment. Then, the XOR choice between StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Now, the second model (without unfairness) would have the same structure except that after SkillAssessment, there is no XOR choice. Instead, all applicants proceed through StandardCulturalFitCheck.

So the second model's structure is:

[Loop between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing] -> SkillAssessment -> StandardCulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

Now, constructing the POWL models.

For the first model:

- The loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing (OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator).
- Then, after the loop, SkillAssessment.
- Then, an XOR choice between StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck (OperatorPOWL with XOR operator).
- Then, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

For the second model:

- Same loop as before.
- Then, SkillAssessment.
- Then, StandardCulturalFitCheck.
- Then, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Now, the edges and partial orders. The loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing. Then, after the loop, SkillAssessment must come next. Then, the XOR choice (if present) or the StandardCulturalFitCheck.

In the first model, after the loop, SkillAssessment is done. Then, the XOR choice is between the two cultural fit checks. The ManagerialReview and FinalDecision come after either of the cultural fit checks.

In the second model, after SkillAssessment, the StandardCulturalFitCheck is done, then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

Now, translating this into POWL.

First model:

Nodes:

- Loop between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing (loop operator)
- SkillAssessment
- XOR between StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck
- ManagerialReview
- FinalDecision

The partial order would have the loop executed first, then SkillAssessment, then the XOR, then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Wait, the loop is part of the resume parsing process. So the loop is executed first, then SkillAssessment, then the XOR, then the rest.

So the POWL model would have the loop as a node, followed by SkillAssessment, then the XOR, then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

But how to structure the partial order. The loop is a loop between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing. Then, after the loop, SkillAssessment is executed. Then, the XOR choice is executed. Then, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So the partial order would have:

Loop (RequestMoreInfo, ResumeParsing) -> SkillAssessment -> XOR (StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

But in POWL, the partial order is defined as a StrictPartialOrder with nodes and edges. So the nodes would be:

- Loop (OperatorPOWL with LOOP)
- SkillAssessment (Transition)
- XOR (OperatorPOWL with XOR)
- ManagerialReview (Transition)
- FinalDecision (Transition)

The edges would be:

Loop -> SkillAssessment
SkillAssessment -> XOR
XOR -> ManagerialReview
XOR -> FinalDecision

Wait, but the XOR has two branches: one leading to StandardCulturalFitCheck and the other to CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, after either of those, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So the XOR node (OperatorPOWL) has two children: StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, each of those leads to ManagerialReview, which then leads to FinalDecision.

Therefore, the edges would be:

Loop -> SkillAssessment
SkillAssessment -> XOR
XOR -> StandardCulturalFitCheck
XOR -> CommunityAffiliationCheck
StandardCulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview
CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview
ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

But in POWL, the nodes are the OperatorPOWL and Transition nodes. So the XOR node is an OperatorPOWL with children StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Then, after the XOR, both StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck lead to ManagerialReview, which then leads to FinalDecision.

So the partial order would have:

Loop (loop between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing) is a node.

SkillAssessment is a node.

XOR is a node (OperatorPOWL with children StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck).

ManagerialReview is a node.

FinalDecision is a node.

The edges:

Loop must be completed before SkillAssessment.

SkillAssessment must be completed before XOR.

XOR must be completed before both StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck must be completed before ManagerialReview.

ManagerialReview must be completed before FinalDecision.

Wait, but in the XOR node, the choice between the two branches. Once one of the branches is taken (either StandardCulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck), then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision follow.

So the edges would be:

Loop -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> XOR

XOR -> StandardCulturalFitCheck

XOR -> CommunityAffiliationCheck

StandardCulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

But in the POWL model, the nodes are the OperatorPOWL and Transition nodes. So the loop is a node (OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator), SkillAssessment is a Transition node, XOR is a node (OperatorPOWL with XOR), ManagerialReview is a Transition node, FinalDecision is a Transition node.

So the partial order would have the nodes as:

- Loop (OperatorPOWL)
- SkillAssessment (Transition)
- XOR (OperatorPOWL)
- ManagerialReview (Transition)
- FinalDecision (Transition)

The order edges would be:

Loop must be completed before SkillAssessment.

SkillAssessment must be completed before XOR.

XOR must be completed before both StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Wait, but the StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck are children of the XOR node. So the XOR node is a single node that has two children. So the edges would be:

Loop -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> XOR

XOR -> ManagerialReview

But wait, the XOR node's children are StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, those transitions would each lead to ManagerialReview. So the XOR node is a single node, and after XOR, the ManagerialReview is executed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The XOR node (OperatorPOWL) has two children: StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Once the XOR is executed (i.e., one of the two branches is taken), then ManagerialReview is executed, and then FinalDecision.

Therefore, the edges would be:

Loop -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> XOR

XOR -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

But the StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck are part of the XOR node's children, so their execution is part of the XOR node. Then, after the XOR node completes (either branch taken), ManagerialReview is executed.

So the partial order would have the XOR node as a node, and the edges are:

Loop -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> XOR

XOR -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

But the StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck are children of the XOR node, so their execution is part of the XOR node's processing.

So, the first model's POWL would have:

Loop (between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing) -> SkillAssessment -> XOR (StandardCulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

In the second model, after the loop and SkillAssessment, it goes to StandardCulturalFitCheck directly, then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

So, the second model's POWL would have:

Loop -> SkillAssessment -> StandardCulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

Now, translating this into the POWL structure using the classes provided.

For the first model:

- Loop is an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing.

Wait, the loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing, so the loop node is an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator, children being RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing.

Wait, the example in the problem's code shows a loop between A and B as * (A, B). So the loop node is an OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP and children A and B.

So for the first model's loop, the loop node is an OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP and children RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing.

Then, the SkillAssessment is a Transition node.

Then, the XOR node is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR and children StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Then, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision are Transition nodes.

The partial order would have:

Loop (loop between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing) must be completed before SkillAssessment.

SkillAssessment must be completed before XOR.

XOR must be completed before ManagerialReview.

ManagerialReview must be completed before FinalDecision.

So the nodes are:

Loop (OperatorPOWL with LOOP and children RequestMoreInfo, ResumeParsing)

SkillAssessment (Transition)

XOR (OperatorPOWL with XOR and children StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)

ManagerialReview (Transition)

FinalDecision (Transition)

The order edges are:

Loop -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> XOR

XOR -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

But in the POWL model, the StrictPartialOrder would have these nodes and the edges.

Similarly, for the second model:

The loop is the same, then SkillAssessment, then StandardCulturalFitCheck (no XOR), then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

So the nodes are:

Loop (same as before)

SkillAssessment

StandardCulturalFitCheck

ManagerialReview

FinalDecision

The order edges:

Loop -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> StandardCulturalFitCheck

StandardCulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

Now, constructing these models in code.

First model (with unfairness):

import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ResumeParsing = Transition(label="ResumeParsing")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[RequestMoreInfo, ResumeParsing])

# XOR between StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# StrictPartialOrder for the first model
root1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, SkillAssessment, xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root1.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root1.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor)
root1.order.add_edge(xor, ManagerialReview)
root1.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Second model (without unfairness):

# Define activities (same as before)
ResumeParsing = Transition(label="ResumeParsing")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[RequestMoreInfo, ResumeParsing])

# StrictPartialOrder for the second model
root2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root2.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root2.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck)
root2.order.add_edge(StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root2.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Wait, but in the first model, the loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing. However, the initial ResumeParsing is part of the loop. But in the initial step, the process starts with ResumeParsing. Then, if data is incomplete, the loop is triggered, which would loop back to RequestMoreInfo, then back to ResumeParsing again. So the loop node is an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator and children RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing.

But the initial activity is ResumeParsing. So in the first model, the loop is part of the process, and the initial node is the loop?

Wait, maybe the loop node is not part of the initial steps. Let me think again. The initial step is ResumeParsing. Then, the system checks for data completeness. If incomplete, it loops back to RequestMoreInfo, which then triggers another ResumeParsing. So the loop is between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing.

But in the POWL model, the loop node is an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator and children RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing. So the loop node is executed first, then the rest of the process.

But the initial step is ResumeParsing. So the loop node is part of the resume parsing process. Therefore, the initial activity is the loop node.

But in the POWL model, the root is the StrictPartialOrder, which includes all the nodes. So the loop node is part of the process.

I think this is correct. The first model's POWL includes the loop node, then the SkillAssessment, then the XOR node, etc.

Similarly for the second model.

Now, checking for any errors. In the first model, the XOR node is an OperatorPOWL with children StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. This introduces the potential unfairness.

In the second model, the XOR is replaced with a direct path to StandardCulturalFitCheck.

Thus, the two models are correctly structured.
</think>

### **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**  
This model includes an **XOR branch** that introduces subtle bias by allowing applicants with local community affiliations to receive preferential treatment during the cultural fit evaluation.  

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ResumeParsing = Transition(label="ResumeParsing")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing (data completeness check)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[RequestMoreInfo, ResumeParsing])

# XOR branch for cultural fit evaluation (introduces bias)
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# StrictPartialOrder for the first model
root1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, SkillAssessment, xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root1.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)  # Loop must complete before skill assessment
root1.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor)   # Skill assessment must complete before XOR choice
root1.order.add_edge(xor, ManagerialReview)  # XOR must complete before managerial review
root1.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)  # Managerial review must complete before final decision
```

---

### **POWL Model Without Unfairness**  
This model ensures **no special treatment for community-affiliated applicants** by eliminating the XOR branch. All applicants undergo the same standard cultural fit evaluation.  

```python
# Define activities (same as above)
ResumeParsing = Transition(label="ResumeParsing")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop between RequestMoreInfo and ResumeParsing (data completeness check)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[RequestMoreInfo, ResumeParsing])

# StrictPartialOrder for the second model
root2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root2.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)         # Loop must complete before skill assessment
root2.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck)  # Skill assessment must complete before cultural fit check
root2.order.add_edge(StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview) # Cultural fit check must complete before managerial review
root2.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)  # Managerial review must complete before final decision
```

---

### **Key Differences**  
1. **Unfairness Model (root1):**  
   - Includes an **XOR branch** (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`) that gives a subtle advantage to applicants with local community affiliations.  
   - The `CommunityAffiliationCheck` activity is part of the XOR choice, allowing biased evaluation.  

2. **Fairness Model (root2):**  
   - Removes the XOR branch entirely.  
   - All applicants proceed through the **standard cultural fit evaluation** (`StandardCulturalFitCheck`), ensuring uniform treatment.  

Both models follow the same sequence of steps (resume parsing  skill assessment  cultural fit evaluation  final decision), but the **XOR branch** is the critical difference that introduces bias in the first model.
