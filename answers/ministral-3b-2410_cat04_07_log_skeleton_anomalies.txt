Based on the provided declarative constraints and activity occurrences, here are some potential anomalies and inconsistencies in the proposed process model:

1. **Equivalence Constraints:**
   - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION') - These two declarations cannot be equivalent as one is a request for approval and the other is a rejection.
   - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR') - These two declarations cannot be equivalent as one is a request for approval and the other is a rejection.
   - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING') - These two declarations cannot be equivalent as one is a request for approval and the other is a rejection.

2. **Always Before and Always After Constraints:**
   - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' is always before 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING', but it's also before 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER', which is never before 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'.
   - 'Payment Handled' is always after 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE', but it's also after 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', which is never before 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE'.
   - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' is always before 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING', but it's also before 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', which is never before 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'.

3. **Never Together Constraints:**
   - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' is never together with 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION', but it's also never together with 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE', which is equivalent to 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION'.
   - 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' is never together with 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', but it's also never together with 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', which is equivalent to 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION'.

4. **Activity Occurrences:**
   - 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE' has occurences up to 6, but 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' has occurences up to 5, which could imply that the latter has a different pattern of occurrences.
   - 'Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER' has occurences up to 3, but 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' has occurences up to 2, and 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER' has occurences up to 2. This inconsistency might suggest a different handling of rejections by different approvers.

5. **Directly-Follows Constraints:**
   - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' directly follows 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', but 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' also directly follows 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', implying that both should occur in the same order.

To resolve these anomalies, you would need to carefully review the business rules and logic behind the process, and possibly adjust the declarative constraints accordingly.
