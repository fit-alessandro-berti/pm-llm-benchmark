Proposed high-level process steps, grouping logic, and mappings

High-level steps (in order)
1) Material Preparation
2) Welding Setup & Execution
3) Weld Quality Verification
4) Surface Protection Application
5) Coating Curing
6) Final Visual Inspection

Rationale for groupings
- Temporal proximity: Events within each group occur back-to-back without unrelated interleaving and with short gaps.
- Functional cohesion: Each group accomplishes a distinct production objective (prepare material, join parts, verify join, protect surface, cure coating, final check).
- Resource alignment: Groups are often dominated by a resource type aligned to the task (operators/robot for prep and welding, sensor for quality, coating unit for application, heating unit for curing, human inspector for final check).
- Process boundaries: Natural handoffs (e.g., from prep to welding tool pick-up; from welding to quality sensor measurement; from coating to drying) define clear stage transitions.

Event-to-step mapping (rules)
- Material Preparation includes actions that identify, position, align, and thermally condition raw material prior to joining:
  - Activities: Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet.
  - Typical resources: Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1.
- Welding Setup & Execution includes tool readiness and actual welding operations:
  - Activities: Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B (and similar welds).
  - Typical resources: Operator B (or welding robot), welding tool.
- Weld Quality Verification includes immediate, in-line assessment of the weld:
  - Activities: Measure weld integrity (sensor measurements, scores).
  - Typical resources: Quality Sensor #1.
- Surface Protection Application includes applying protective media:
  - Activities: Apply protective coating (any coating type).
  - Typical resources: Coating Unit #3 (or equivalent).
- Coating Curing includes any thermal or timed curing/drying step:
  - Activities: Dry coating (or cure, bake).
  - Typical resources: Heating Unit #2 (or curing oven).
- Final Visual Inspection is the human acceptance gate:
  - Activities: Visual check (pass/fail or defect notes).
  - Typical resources: Operator C (or inspector role).

Generalizable grouping heuristics for the full log
- Start of Material Preparation: First appearance of a raw material retrieval or barcode scan for a CaseID; ends at the last pre-processing action prior to joining (alignment/preheat).
- Start of Welding Setup & Execution: First tool pickup or welding action after prep; ends at the last welding action before a quality measurement.
- Start of Weld Quality Verification: First weld measurement; ends before any surface treatment action.
- Start of Surface Protection Application: First coating application action; ends before any curing/drying action.
- Start of Coating Curing: First drying/baking/curing action; ends before any human inspection.
- Start of Final Visual Inspection: First visual check; ends at pass/fail decision or handoff to rework if failed.

Notes and extensibility
- If additional welds (e.g., corners C/D) or repeated integrity measurements occur, they remain within Steps 2 and 3, respectively.
- If a quality check fails, insert a Rework loop between Steps 3 and 4 (e.g., “Rework Welding” and repeat verification).
- Parameterization: thresholds for “temporal proximity” (e.g., max 2–5 minutes gap) and resource-based cues can be tuned per line.
- This schema supports aggregation for dashboards and conformance checking, enabling start/end timestamps per high-level step, durations, and handoff analytics.
