Below is one way to write the query in DuckDB:

--------------------------------------------------
WITH valid_cases AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN valid_cases v ON e.case_id = v.case_id;
--------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

1. The WITH clause (common table expression) calculates the count of events for each case_id and filters to keep only those case_id entries that have six or fewer events.

2. The main query then joins the event_log table with the valid_cases list, ensuring that only events from cases meeting the count criteria are included in the final result.
