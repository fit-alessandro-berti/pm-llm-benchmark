Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task. The user provided a scenario where there's a temporal profile model for an insurance claim process, and some anomalies in the average times between certain activities. My job is to identify the anomalies, hypothesize why they might exist, and then come up with SQL queries to verify these hypotheses using the given database schema.

Starting with the first task: identifying the anomalies in the temporal profile. The temporal_profile dictionary has several activity pairs with their average times and standard deviations. Let me look at each pair and compare them against what might be expected in a normal process flow.

Looking at the provided model:

- ('R', 'A'): 1 hour average, 10 minutes STDEV. That seems reasonable. Assigning a claim after receiving it shouldn't take too long, maybe automated or quick human assignment. The low STDEV suggests consistency here, which might be okay unless there's a hidden issue.

- ('R', 'E'): 1 day average, 8 hours STDEV. So from receiving to evaluation takes a day on average. The STDEV is 8 hours, which is a third of the average. Maybe acceptable, but need to see others.

- ('R', 'P'): The average here is 90000 seconds, which is 25 hours (since 3600*25=90000). The STDEV is 3600 seconds (1 hour). The note says this is suspiciously low STDEV. A low STDEV means the time between R to P is almost always around 25 hours, which is very tight. That might indicate an automated step that's rigidly scheduled, but maybe skipping steps like evaluation?

Wait, the process steps are supposed to be R -> A -> E -> P -> N -> C. Wait, actually according to the intended process steps listed, the order is R (Receive), A (Assign), E (Evaluate), P (Approve), N (Notify), C (Close). So R to P should go through A and E first. If the average time from R to P is 25 hours, but the standard deviation is very low, that could mean that approval happens right after evaluation, but the path from R to P might be capturing a direct jump? Or maybe the model is considering the entire path, but the STDEV being low suggests that every time, it's exactly 25h, which might be odd. Maybe there's a fixed timer or an automated step that's forcing this, bypassing some checks?

Next, ('A', 'C') has an average of 2 hours with 1 hour STDEV. That seems too fast. Because after assigning, you should have Evaluate, Approve, etc. before closing. So closing after just 2 hours after assignment might indicate that some claims are being closed too quickly, perhaps skipping steps. That's a possible anomaly.

Then ('E', 'N') is 5 minutes average with 1 minute STDEV. Evaluation to Notify in 5 minutes? That seems very quick. Maybe the Notify is triggered immediately upon evaluation, but if the process requires some steps between, that could be an issue. Or perhaps the system auto-notifies right after evaluation, which might be okay, but the STDEV is very low, which might indicate that it's forced.

The ('P', 'N') pair has an average of 7 days (604800 seconds) and STDEV of 2 days. That's a huge gap between approval and notification. Why would there be such a long delay? Maybe approvals get stuck, or there's a backlog causing delayed notifications. The high STDEV suggests inconsistency here.

('N', 'C') is 30 minutes, which seems okay.

So the anomalies mentioned in the example are R->P (low STDEV), P->N (long average), A->C (too quick), and E->N (too quick). 

Now, moving on to the second task: hypothesizing reasons for these anomalies.

For R to P having low STDEV: perhaps the approval is automatically triggered after a fixed time, maybe by a system that schedules it exactly 25 hours later, which might skip the evaluation step? Or maybe the model's calculation is wrong because the path skips some steps. Alternatively, maybe the system is designed that way, but the question says to consider anomalies, so the low STDEV is suspicious.

Possible reasons for R to P anomaly: automated workflow that strictly sets approval time after R, bypassing necessary steps, leading to rigid timing. Or maybe some claims are getting approved without proper evaluation, hence the tight timing.

For P to N's 7 days average with 2 days STDEV: maybe there's a delay in notifying the customer after approval. Maybe the notifications are batch processed weekly, causing the 7-day average, but sometimes done quicker. Or it's a backlog in the notification system. Or perhaps after approval, there's a manual step that's slow, leading to delays.

A to C being 2 hours: claims are being closed too soon after assignment. Maybe the adjuster is closing the claim prematurely without going through all steps. Like maybe they assigned and then closed without proceeding to evaluate or approve.

E to N's 5 minutes: maybe the system automatically sends a notification right after evaluation, but maybe it's supposed to wait for approval first? If the process requires approval after evaluation, then the notification should come after P, so E to N being 5 minutes might mean the notification is triggered at the wrong point, or the approval step is being skipped. Alternatively, maybe the model's calculation is wrong because the actual path should be E -> P -> N, so E to N would have a longer time. If the average is 5 minutes, that suggests that N is happening right after E, which might skip steps. So that's an anomaly.

Now, the hypotheses need to be plausible. Let's list them per anomaly:

1. R to P (short time, low STDEV): Maybe approvals are scheduled automatically after a fixed time without proper evaluation, leading to a rigid timeline. Or maybe the system is misconfigured to skip evaluation steps, so after R, it goes straight to P, making the time between R and P too short and very consistent.

2. P to N (7 days average): There's a delay in sending notifications after approval, perhaps due to a bottleneck in the notifications team, or a system backlog, or maybe the approval is done but the notification step is delayed by other factors.

3. A to C (2 hours): Claims are being closed immediately after assignment without completing necessary steps. Maybe the adjuster assigned to the claim is closing it prematurely, perhaps because of misconfiguration or human error.

4. E to N (5 minutes): The notification is triggered right after evaluation, but before approval, which might be a process error. The system might be sending notifications before approval is finalized, which is a problem.

Now, moving on to the SQL queries. The queries need to find claims where the time between two activities falls outside expected ranges, and also correlate with adjusters, regions, etc.

First, for each anomaly, I need to write a query that finds claims with times outside the average ± 2 or 3 STDEVs (or whatever threshold they specify). The ZETA factor mentioned in the problem might mean using a Z-score. But the problem says to use the model's averages and STDEVS to detect deviations.

Let me structure each part.

Starting with the first anomaly: R to P with low STDEV. The average is 25h, STDEV 1h. The anomaly is the low STDEV. To check this, we need to see if most claims have exactly around 25h between R and P. So perhaps a query to count claims where the time between R and P is within a tight range. Wait, but the anomaly is the low STDEV, so the query might look for claims where the duration is close to the average (indicating lack of variation), but maybe the problem wants to find claims where the time between R and P is way off, but the model's STDEV is low. Hmm, perhaps the user wants to check if the actual data has low variability here. Alternatively, maybe the R-P time is actually correct, but the model's STDEV is low, which might indicate that in reality, it's very consistent, which could be a problem if it's not supposed to be. So to verify, the query might look for claims where the R-P time is exactly the average, or check how many are within a small window. Alternatively, maybe the model's STDEV is too low, so the actual data might have more variation. Wait, the problem states that the temporal profile's STDEV is 3600 seconds (1 hour) for R-P, but the note says "suspiciously low STDEV". So the STDEV being low is the anomaly. To verify this, the SQL can calculate the actual STDEV of R-P times in the data and see if it's indeed that low. But maybe the user wants to check if there are claims that deviate from this, but since the STDEV is part of the model's definition, the actual data might be following it closely. Alternatively, the problem says that the model's values might have anomalies, so perhaps the low STDEV is an issue. The user wants to find why that STDEV is low. Maybe the actual process enforces a strict timeline here, but that's not part of the intended process steps. So to check this, the query could find claims where the time between R and P is within a very narrow range around 25h, indicating that it's too rigid.

Alternatively, the hypothesis is that the process is skipping steps (like E and P happening too quickly), so the query would look for claims where the R-P time is much shorter than expected, but the model's average is 25h. Wait, maybe the actual path should go through A, E, then P. The model's R-P is 25h, but maybe the actual path includes steps that should take longer. Wait, but the model's average is based on actual data, so maybe the model is showing that in reality, R to P is 25h, but according to the process steps, it should go through E first. So the model's R-P time is capturing the full path, but the STDEV is low, which might indicate that the system is forcing approvals at exactly that time, perhaps skipping evaluation steps. So to verify, the query could find claims where the time between R and P is exactly around the average, or check if there are many cases where the R-P time is close to 25h, indicating no variance. Alternatively, check if there are cases where between R and P, the E step is missing, causing the time to be fixed.

Moving on to the queries for each anomaly:

For the R to P anomaly:

Hypothesis: The system is automatically scheduling approval at a fixed time, bypassing evaluation steps.

The query could look for claims where the time from R to P is exactly around 25h and check if they have an E activity in between. Or check if the E activity's timestamp is after R but before P. Wait, but the process steps are R -> A -> E -> P -> N -> C, so between R and P, there should be steps like A and E. The R-P time includes those steps, so if the time is tight, maybe those steps are being done very quickly, but the low STDEV suggests consistency. Alternatively, maybe the E step is missing for some claims, leading to a shorter path. So a query to find claims where the time between R and P is close to 25h, but check if there's an E in between. Or check for claims where the E activity is missing between R and P.

But maybe that's getting too deep. Alternatively, the query can just calculate the actual time between R and P for each claim and see the variance. But the user wants to use the model's values. The model says the average is 25h, STDEV 1h. To detect anomalies, maybe claims where the R-P time is within that STDEV (since low STDEV is the issue), but the question is to find why it's low. Alternatively, the low STDEV in the model is the anomaly, so the query could check if the actual data does have low variance, but that's more of a statistical test. Since the user wants to find claims with unusual times, maybe for R-P, since the STDEV is low, but the problem is that it's too low, perhaps indicating something wrong. Maybe the system is forcing approval after exactly 25h regardless of evaluation steps, leading to very consistent times. To verify, we can find claims where the time between R and P is exactly that average, and see if they skipped steps.

Alternatively, the query might look for claims where the time between R and P is within a narrow range, like between 24h and 26h, which would show the consistency.

But perhaps the intended approach is to check for claims that fall outside the model's expected range. Wait, the problem's example mentions that the model's values themselves are anomalies. The user's task is to generate queries that can test the hypotheses. So for each anomaly, the query should find instances where the actual time between the activities deviates from the model's average plus/minus some multiple of STDEV. Wait, but the problem mentions that the model's own averages and STDEVs are the given ones. The anomalies are in the model's numbers. For example, the R-P STDEV is low, which is the anomaly. To test that, perhaps the actual data does have that low STDEV, which might indicate a forced process. So the query could calculate the actual standard deviation of R-P times, but since the user wants to find claims, perhaps the query would look for claims that have R-P times that are exactly on average, or check if most are close. Alternatively, maybe the problem's anomaly is that the model's STDEV is low, so the query can check how many claims have R-P times within a narrow window.

Alternatively, maybe for the R-P anomaly, the query would find claims where the R-P time is close to the average, but with no E step in between, indicating that steps are skipped.

Alternatively, to detect claims where between R and P, there's no E activity. Because in the process steps, after R comes A, then E, then P. So between R and P, there must be E. So if a claim's R-P time is short (like 25h) but without the E step, that would be an issue. So a query to find claims where the time between R and P is within the model's average (25h) but missing the E activity. That's a possible way to verify the hypothesis that steps are skipped.

Similarly, for the P to N anomaly (7 days avg, 2 days STDEV). The problem states that's a long delay. The query could find claims where the time between P and N is over 7 days, or under but the high STDEV means sometimes it's much longer. The hypothesis is that there's a bottleneck in notifications after approval, so the query could find all claims where the P to N duration exceeds 7 days + 2*STDEV (or 9 days?), to find the long delays.

For A to C taking 2 hours, which is too quick, the hypothesis is that claims are being closed too soon. The query would look for claims where the time between A (assign) and C (close) is less than some threshold. Since the model's average is 2 hours, but the process should take longer, perhaps the query would look for claims where A to C is under a certain threshold, like under 2 hours (the average?), but maybe under an expected longer time. Or find claims where A to C is under a day, but according to the model's average is 2h, which is too short, so the query could find claims closed soon after assignment, and see if they have missing steps. For example, check if the claims have all required steps in between A and C.

For E to N taking 5 minutes, the hypothesis is that the notification is triggered before approval, which is incorrect. Since the process should have E -> P -> N. So if E to N is 5 minutes, that skips the approval step. The query could find claims where the E to N time is very short, and check if the P step occurred before N.

Alternatively, check if there are claims where N occurs before P, which would be an error. Because the process steps should have P before N. Wait, looking at the process steps: the steps are R, A, E, P, N, C. So N comes after P. So if the E to N time is 5 minutes, but that would require that after E, P hasn't happened yet, so the N is happening before P. That's an error. So the query could find claims where the N event occurs before the P event. That would indicate that the notification is happening before approval, which is a process error. That would explain the short E-to-N time.

So for E to N, the query might look for claims where the N event occurs before the P event, which would be an error.

Now, structuring the queries:

Starting with the first anomaly: R to P with low STDEV.

Hypothesis: The process is skipping evaluation steps, so the time between R and P is fixed. To check this:

Possible query to find claims where between R and P, there is no E activity. 

Alternatively, get the time between R and P and see if it's very close to the model's average (25h) and check if the E step exists.

The SQL query for this would involve, for each claim, getting the R and P timestamps, calculate the duration, and see if the E event exists between R and P.

But let's think in terms of SQL queries.

First, for R to P anomaly:

Verification Query 1:

SELECT claim_id, 
       (p.timestamp - r.timestamp) AS duration_seconds,
FROM claims
JOIN claim_events r ON claims.claim_id = r.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events p ON claims.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
WHERE (p.timestamp - r.timestamp) BETWEEN 25*3600 - 2*3600 AND 25*3600 + 2*3600; -- Within average ± 2 STDEVs (since STDEV is 1h)

Wait, but the issue is the STDEV being low, so the actual data has low variance. To find the presence of low variance, maybe the query would just calculate the standard deviation, but the user wants to find specific claims. Alternatively, find claims where the duration is exactly on the average, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, check if between R and P, there's no E step. So for each claim, check if there exists an 'E' event between R and P.

So:

SELECT claim_id
FROM claims
WHERE claim_id IN (SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity='E')
AND claim_id in (SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P')
HAVING ... Wait, perhaps:

SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events e ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
JOIN claim_events p ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
WHERE p.timestamp < e.timestamp -- Wait, no. Wait, the E should come before P. So if the E is present, but the time between R and P is still 25h, but perhaps E is not done, so better to find claims where there is no E between R and P.

Wait, to find claims where between R and P, there's no E activity:

SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events e
    WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
    AND e.activity = 'E'
    AND e.timestamp > (SELECT r.timestamp FROM claim_events r WHERE r.claim_id = c.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R')
    AND e.timestamp < (SELECT p.timestamp FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = c.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P')
)
);

Hmm, this is getting complicated with subqueries. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to find claims where the time between R and P is close to 25h but missing the E step.

Alternatively, for the R-P anomaly, the query could be:

SELECT c.claim_id, p.timestamp - r.timestamp AS duration
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events r ON c.claim_id = r.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events p ON c.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
WHERE e.timestamp IS NULL OR e.timestamp < r.timestamp OR e.timestamp > p.timestamp;

Wait, perhaps the key is that the E step is missing. So a query to find claims where the E activity is missing between R and P.

Alternatively, to check if E exists between R and P for those claims with R-P time around 25h.

Alternatively, the simplest way to find claims that have no E between R and P:

SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'R'
AND claim_id IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e 
        WHERE e.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id
        AND e.activity = 'E'
        AND e.timestamp > (SELECT r.timestamp FROM claim_events r WHERE r.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R')
        AND e.timestamp < (SELECT p.timestamp FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P')
    )
);

This is getting complex with subqueries, but perhaps the user just wants a basic query that finds claims where between R and P, there is no E step. So:

SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'R'
AND claim_id IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P'
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e
    WHERE e.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id
    AND e.activity = 'E'
    AND e.timestamp > (SELECT r.timestamp FROM claim_events r WHERE r.claim_id = e.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R')
    AND e.timestamp < (SELECT p.timestamp FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = e.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P')
));

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is:

SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e
    WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
    AND e.timestamp BETWEEN 
        (SELECT r.timestamp FROM claim_events r WHERE r.claim_id = c.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R')
        AND e.timestamp < (SELECT p.timestamp FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = c.claim_id and p.activity = 'P')
);

This is getting complicated, but perhaps the user expects simpler queries. Alternatively, the query could just find claims where the time between R and P is within the model's average ± STDEV, but that's not exactly verifying the hypothesis. Maybe the user expects to find claims where the R-P time is close to the average, but with missing steps.

Alternatively, the first verification query for R-P anomaly could be:

SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp) AS duration_seconds,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'E') AS has_eval
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events r ON c.claim_id = r.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events p ON c.claim_id = p.claim_id and p.activity = 'P'
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id and e.activity = 'E'
WHERE e.claim_id IS NULL -- meaning no evaluation step?

Wait, if the evaluation is missing, then such claims would have a R-P time that might be shorter, but according to the model's average is 25h, so maybe they skipped E, hence the time is shorter. Wait, but the model's average is 25h, which may include the E step. Hmm, perhaps it's better to focus on whether E exists between R and P.

Moving on to the next anomaly: P to N's 7 days average. To check that, the query would find claims where the time between P and N is over 7+2 days (average plus STDEV), but maybe also under? The high STDEV suggests that sometimes it's much longer, sometimes shorter. The hypothesis is that sometimes it's delayed. So to find claims with P to N > 7 days + STDEV (2 days?), so over 9 days, or under 5 days? Or just find all claims where P to N is over 7 days.

Query for P to N:

SELECT c.claim_id, (n.timestamp - p.timestamp) AS duration
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
WHERE p.activity = 'P'
AND (n.timestamp - p.timestamp) > (7*24*3600) -- 7 days in seconds
ORDER BY duration DESC;

That would find claims where approval to notification took over a week.

Next, the A to C anomaly (2 hours avg). The hypothesis is that it's too quick, so claims are closed too soon after assignment. So find claims where the time between A and C is under, say, 3 hours? Or just below a reasonable time. The model's average is 2h, which is very short. The process should have steps between A and C, like E, P, N. So any claim that went from A to C without those steps.

So the query could check if between A and C, there are missing steps. Alternatively, find claims where the time from A to C is under 2 hours:

SELECT c.claim_id, (c.timestamp - a.timestamp) AS duration
FROM claim_events a
JOIN claim_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id AND c.activity = 'C'
WHERE a.activity = 'A'
AND (c.timestamp - a.timestamp) < (2*60*60) -- 2 hours
ORDER BY duration ASC;

Additionally, check if those claims have steps like E, P, N in between.

Alternatively, check if those claims have any E, P, N steps between A and C. If they don't, that's a problem.

But maybe the query is just to find all claims where the time between A and C is under 2 hours, to see if they're being closed too quickly.

For the E to N anomaly (5 minutes), which is too quick, and the hypothesis is that N is done before P):

The E to N time is 5 minutes, but the process requires P to happen before N. So any claims where N occurs before P would be an error. So the query could find claims where N's timestamp is before P's timestamp.

SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
AND n.timestamp < e.timestamp -- Wait, no, E to N is the time between E and N, so the E should be before N normally, but the problem is that the notification is happening before approval. Wait, according to process steps, after E comes P, then N. So the approval must come after E and before N. So if N occurs before P, that's an issue.

Thus, to find claims where N occurs before P:

SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events n
    WHERE n.claim_id = c.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
    AND n.timestamp < (
        SELECT p.timestamp FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = c.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
    )
);

This would find claims where notification was before approval, which is invalid.

Now, the queries for each anomaly:

Putting it all together, the user expects each anomaly to have a hypothesis and a query.

Now, structuring all this into the required sections.

First, list the anomalies as per the model's entries, then hypotheses, then queries.

Anomalies:

1. R to P has very low STDEV (1h) despite the average of 25h. This suggests rigid timing possibly bypassing steps.

2. P to N has a long average of 7 days with high STDEV (2 days). So sometimes very long delays.

3. A to C has a very short average of 2h, suggesting premature closure.

4. E to N has a very short time (5 mins), which is wrong because N should come after P.

Now, the hypotheses:

For R-P anomaly:

Hypothesis: The system is automatically triggering approval immediately after a fixed period without proper evaluation, leading to a rigid schedule with no variance.

For P-N:

Hypothesis: Approvals are backlogged, leading to long waits before notification.

For A-C:

Hypothesis: Claims are being closed prematurely after assignment, skipping necessary steps.

For E-N:

Hypothesis: Notification happens before approval, causing the short time.

Queries:

For R-P anomaly (hypothesis: missing evaluation steps):

SELECT c.claim_id, 
       (SELECT e.timestamp FROM claim_events e WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E') AS eval_time,
       (SELECT MIN(p.timestamp) FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = c.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P') AS approve_time
FROM claims c
WHERE (approve_time - (SELECT r.timestamp FROM claim_events r WHERE r.claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity='R') ) BETWEEN 25*3600 - 600 AND 25*3600 + 600 -- within 1h of average
AND (eval_time is null OR eval_time > approve_time); -- Either no evaluation or evaluation after approval.

Alternatively, a better approach:

SELECT c.claim_id, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'E') as has_evaluation
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events r ON ...
Wait, maybe:

Find claims where there's no 'E' event between R and P:

SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events r ON c.claim_id = r.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events p ON c.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
WHERE e.claim_id IS NULL -- missing evaluation
OR e.timestamp > p.timestamp; -- evaluation after approval, which shouldn't happen.

Wait, but E should be before P. So if E is missing or after P, that's an issue.

Another approach for the R-P anomaly's query:

SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e
    WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
    AND e.timestamp > (SELECT r.timestamp FROM claim_events r WHERE r.claim_id = c.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R')
    AND e.timestamp < (SELECT p.timestamp FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = c.claim_id and p.activity = 'P'
)
);

This would find claims where there's no E event between R and P.

Alternatively, to check for E existing between R and P:

SELECT c.claim_id,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events e 
        WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E' 
        AND e.timestamp > (SELECT r.timestamp FROM claim_events r WHERE r.claim_id = c.claim_id and r.activity = 'R')
        and e.timestamp < (SELECT p.timestamp FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = c.claim_id and p.activity = 'P')
        ) AS has_e_between
FROM claims c
WHERE has_e_between = 0;

This would find claims missing E between R and P.

Moving on to the next anomaly, P to N's long delay:

The hypothesis is that there are backlogs causing long waits. The query would find claims where P to N took longer than average plus STDEV:

SELECT c.claim_id, (n.timestamp - p.timestamp) AS duration
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
WHERE p.activity = 'P'
AND n.timestamp - p.timestamp > (7*24*3600 + 2*24*3600) -- 7 days + 2*STDEV (2 days)
ORDER BY duration DESC;

Or just those over 7 days.

Next, A to C's 2 hours. The query would look for claims where the time between A and C is under 2 hours + some buffer, but the hypothesis is that they're closed too quickly. So:

SELECT c.claim_id, (c.timestamp - a.timestamp) AS duration
FROM claim_events a
JOIN claim_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id AND c.activity = 'C'
WHERE a.activity = 'A'
AND (c.timestamp - a.timestamp) < 2*60*60 -- under 2h
ORDER BY duration ASC;

For the E to N anomaly (5 mins):

Query to find claims where N occurred before P:

SELECT n.claim_id
FROM claim_events n
JOIN claim_events p ON n.claim_id = p.claim_id
WHERE n.activity = 'N' AND p.activity = 'P'
AND n.timestamp < p.timestamp;

Because N should come after P. So any N before P is an issue.

Putting this all together, but need to structure each anomaly with a hypothesis and a query.

Now, ensuring the SQL syntax is correct. For example, in PostgreSQL, time calculations between timestamps can be done via extracting epoch or using interval.

Wait, in PostgreSQL, subtracting two timestamps gives an interval, which can be converted to seconds via EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)).

So for the R-P query:

SELECT claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp) AS duration_seconds,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events e WHERE e.claim_id = r.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E') AS has_E
FROM claim_events r
JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
WHERE r.activity = 'R'
AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp) BETWEEN (25*3600 - 3600) AND (25*3600 + 3600) -- within 24h to 26h
AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events e 
     WHERE e.claim_id = r.claim_id 
     AND e.activity = 'E') = 0;

This would find claims with R-P time within a tight window and no E step.

Alternatively, perhaps the first query for this anomaly is just to find claims where the time between R and P is within the model's average ± STDEV, but missing E step.

Alternatively, the query can be:

-- For R to P anomaly (low STDEV and possible missing steps):
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE 
EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events r WHERE r.claim_id = c.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R'
    AND r.timestamp < (SELECT p.timestamp FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = c.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P')
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e 
    WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
    AND e.activity = 'E'
    AND e.timestamp > (SELECT r.timestamp FROM claim_events r WHERE r.claim_id = c.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R')
    AND e.timestamp < (SELECT p.timestamp FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = c.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P')
);

This would find claims between R and P where the E activity is missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the simplest way is to look for claims where the E event is missing between R and P. So:

SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'R'
AND claim_id IN (SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P')
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e WHERE e.claim_id = claim_id AND e.activity = 'E');

Wait, but that might not capture if E is between R and P. Perhaps better to use a self-join:

SELECT r.claim_id
FROM claim_events r
JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON r.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
WHERE r.activity = 'R'
AND (p.timestamp - r.timestamp) BETWEEN 25*3600 - 600 AND 25*3600 + 600 -- within model's average ± STDEV
AND e.activity IS NULL;

That would find claims where R to P is within the tight window and missing E.

Alternatively, maybe the user just wants a query that finds claims with short A to C times:

For the A to C anomaly (2h average):

SELECT a.claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp) AS duration_seconds
FROM claim_events a
JOIN claim_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id AND c.activity = 'C'
WHERE a.activity = 'A'
AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp) < 2*60*60 + 300; -- within the model's average plus some variance.

Wait, but the problem is the average is already very low, so the query would just list those claims with A to C under a certain threshold.

Alternatively, find claims
