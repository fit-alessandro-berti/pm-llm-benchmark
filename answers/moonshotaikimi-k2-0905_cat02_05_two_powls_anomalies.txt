Below the "Hire-to-Retire" logic is mapped against the two POWL variants.  
For each model we list what is missing/wrong, rate the severity of the anomaly and compare the two results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. NORMATIVE REFERENCE FLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Post job ad  
  
Screen candidates (only possible after job is posted)  
  
Conduct interviews (only for screened & shortlisted applicants)  
  
Make hiring decision (only after interviews)  
  
On-board the chosen candidate (only after positive decision)  
  
Add to payroll (during / right after on-boarding)  
  
Close case (once everything is finished)

Key correctness rules:
- Mandatory ordering: Screen < Interview < Decide < Onboard < Payroll < Close  
- Post must be first; Close must be last.  
- No activity can occur twice for the same instance (no loop)  
- Payroll (and equally Onboard) must not be skip-able.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. POWL MODEL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Graph built:  
Post  Screen <|---> Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close  
(Edge "Screen  Decide" exists, so Screen < Decide)

A. Partial-order anomaly (moderate):  
Interview and Decide both succeed Screen, but no order is imposed between Interview and Decide. Hence the model allows Decide to execute before Interview (direct violation of the norm).  

B. No structural anomalies – every mandatory task is present exactly once, no loops, no hidden skips.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. POWL MODEL 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Structure:  
Post  Screen  
Post  Interview (no order Screen < Interview)  
Interview  Decide  
Decide  *(Onboard, silent-skip)  XOR(Payroll, silent-skip)  Close

Anomalies:
- Same interview/decide problem as Model 1 (no edge Screen  Interview allows Decide before Interview).  
- Screen and Interview are in parallel from Post, so Interview can occur before Screen – violates screening-then-interview rule.  
- Decision may be taken while nobody has been screened.  
- On-boarding can be executed 0, 1, 2 … times because it sits in a loop; adds superfluous repetitions.  
- Both On-boarding and Payroll are optional – they can silently be skipped due to the XOR with silent transition. Skipping payroll makes the hire invisible in the salary system, a critical business error.  

Severity of individual anomalies:  
o Decide-before-Interview: moderate  
o Interview-before-Screen: moderate  
o Optional Payroll: critical  
o Looping On-board: minor but odd

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. WHICH MODEL IS "CLOSER" TO THE NORM
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Model 1 has only one moderate ordering flaw (possible Decide < Interview) but keeps every mandatory activity compulsory and exactly once.  
- Model 2 repeats that flaw, adds a second ordering flaw (Interview < Screen), makes On-board repeatable and, much worse, allows the whole hire to finish without ever adding the person to the payroll or even on-boarding her.  

Therefore POWL Model 1, although still incorrect with respect to the sequencing of Interview and Decide, is considerably closer to a sound Hire-to-Retire process because it preserves the obligatory nature of all main activities and avoids the critical payroll-skip and looping anomalies that make Model 2 completely unsuitable for real-life deployment.
