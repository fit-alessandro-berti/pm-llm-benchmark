To infer the case groupings (i.e., which events belong to the same patient journey), we need to look for consistent attributes across events that suggest they belong to the same case. The key attributes to consider are:
1. **Patient age and gender**: These are unique identifiers for a patient in this dataset.
2. **Department**: Events for the same patient will typically occur in the same or related departments (e.g., ER and Radiology for ER patients, Surgery and Recovery for surgery patients).
3. **Activity sequence**: Events for the same patient will follow a logical sequence (e.g., registration  triage  consultation  discharge).
4. **Timestamp**: Events for the same patient will be close in time (though not necessarily contiguous due to interleaving).

### Step-by-Step Grouping:
1. **Case 1 (ER Patient, Age 45, Male)**:
   - Event 1: Register patient (ER, age 45, M)
   - Event 4: Initial triage (ER, age 45, M)
   - Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology, age 45, M)
   - Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER, age 45, M)
   - Event 15: Patient discharged (ER, age 45, M)

2. **Case 2 (ER Patient, Age 62, Female)**:
   - Event 2: Register patient (ER, age 62, F)
   - Event 5: Initial triage (ER, age 62, F)
   - Event 8: Lab test requested (ER, age 62, F)
   - Event 10: Lab test completed (Laboratory, age 62, F)
   - Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER, age 62, F)
   - Event 14: Prescription created (ER, age 62, F)
   - Event 17: Patient discharged (ER, age 62, F)

3. **Case 3 (Surgery Patient, Age 28, Male)**:
   - Event 3: Register patient (Surgery, age 28, M)
   - Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery, age 28, M)
   - Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery, age 28, M)
   - Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery, age 28, M)
   - Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery, age 28, M)
   - Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery, age 28, M)

### Verification:
- All events for each case have consistent `patient_age` and `patient_gender`.
- The sequence of activities for each case follows a logical flow (e.g., registration  triage  tests  discharge for ER patients, registration  consultation  surgery  recovery  discharge for surgery patients).
- Departments are consistent or related (e.g., ER and Radiology for ER patients, Surgery and Recovery for surgery patients).

### Final Groupings:
**Case 1 (ER, Age 45, Male)**:
1, 4, 7, 12, 15

**Case 2 (ER, Age 62, Female)**:
2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17

**Case 3 (Surgery, Age 28, Male)**:
3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
