Alright — let’s break this down step by step, looking carefully at the **standard Hire-to-Retire process**, the provided **POWL models**, and the anomalies in each.

## 1 **Normative Hire-to-Retire Process**

A typical “Hire-to-Retire” process in its clean, logical form might look like this (sequence):

1. **Post_Job_Ad**  
2. **Screen_Candidates** — initial filtering of applicants  
3. **Conduct_Interviews** — deeper selection process  
4. **Make_Hiring_Decision** — deciding whether to hire  
5. **Onboard_Employee** — training, orientation, and setup for new hire  
6. **Add_to_Payroll** — record employee in payroll system  
7. **Close_Case** — mark case closed

Main rules:
- **Screening** before interviews: interviews typically occur after screening resumes/applications.
- **Hiring decision** after interviews: without interviewing, decisions are incomplete.
- **Onboarding** only if hiring decision is positive.
- **Payroll** should happen after onboarding, not before or optionally skipping it.
- There’s no business logic in allowing onboarding or payroll steps to be arbitrarily skipped.
- “Close case” only after the full process path is complete.

## 2 **Analyzing POWL Model 1**

### Model 1 edges:
```
Post -> Screen
Screen -> Decide
Screen -> Interview
Decide -> Onboard
Onboard -> Payroll
Payroll -> Close
```
This **partial order** means:
- Screening  both interview and decision may follow (but not necessarily dependent).
- Screening has two parallel outgoing edges: to Decide and to Interview.
- There is **no direct dependency** from *Interview* to *Make_Hiring_Decision*.

####  What aligns with the normative process:
- Posting the job is required first, followed by screening.
- Onboarding  Payroll  Close is in correct order.
- The hiring decision comes before onboarding.

####  Anomalies:
1. **Parallelism between interviews and decision-making:**  
   - The model allows *Make_Hiring_Decision* to occur **before or without interviews**, since there is no required order interview  decision.  
   - This violates typical hiring logic — decisions should use interview results.
2. **Interviews may be skipped entirely:**  
   - There’s no guarantee that *Conduct_Interviews* is executed at all before onboarding.
3. **Screen feeds directly to decision:**  
   - Suggests that after screening, management may decide without meeting candidates — possible in some edge cases but atypical for a full hiring process.

**Severity:** Moderately severe — The core flow (posting  screening  decide  onboard  payroll  close) is preserved, but omitting/parallelizing interviews undermines hiring quality.

## 3 **Analyzing POWL Model 2**

### Structure:
```
Post -> Screen
Post -> Interview
Interview -> Decision
Decision -> loop_onboarding
loop_onboarding -> xor_payroll
xor_payroll -> Close
```

Where:
- **loop_onboarding** = Loop(Onboard Employee, skip) — onboarding can be repeated, but can also immediately skip after first loop step.
- **xor_payroll** = XOR(Payroll, skip) — either add to payroll or skip it entirely.

####  What aligns:
- Decision follows after interviews (good — interviews must happen before decision).
- Payroll follows onboarding if chosen.

####  Anomalies:
1. **Screening and interviews in parallel**:  
   - Post  Screen and Post  Interview in parallel means interviews can start **before screening is finished**, which is unusual; normally screening filters who is interviewed.
2. **Onboarding loop**:  
   - Loop allows onboarding multiple times, which is illogical unless handling some rare training refresh scenario — unrealistic normal process modeling.
3. **Payroll optional (XOR with skip)**:  
   - Payroll can be completely skipped after onboarding — this violates essential HR/payroll requirements. If a person is hired and onboarded, payroll should be mandatory.
4. **Skipping onboarding after decision**:  
   - The loop definition allows immediate skip from Deciding to Payroll/Close — possible onboarding omission.

**Severity:** More severe than Model 1 — skipping payroll or onboarding fundamentally breaks the essence of Hire-to-Retire (you can end up with an "employee" in the system without added payroll or even onboarding).

## 4 **Comparison & Which Aligns More Closely**

**Model 1 — Key Points:**
- Keeps a fixed sequence for core hire  onboard  payroll  close.
- Main flaw: Interviews are not mandatory before decision-making.
- All mandatory post-decision steps are enforced.
- Skipping interviews is a quality issue, not a process-integrity blocker.

**Model 2 — Key Points:**
- Enforces interview before decision (good).
- But allows screening concurrently with interviewing (questionable), which may cause interviewing unqualified people.
- Allows skipping onboarding and payroll — severe violation, likely leading to incomplete or invalid hires.
- Onboarding can be repeated unnecessarily.

---

### **Verdict:**
**Model 1** more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire process.

**Justification:**
- Even though Model 1 permits decision before interviews and allows skipping interviews entirely (a procedural quality weakness), it **preserves all core backbone steps** from decision  onboarding  payroll  close without skipping.  
- Model 2’s option to bypass payroll or onboarding is a **process integrity violation**, producing incomplete hires — fundamentally breaking the Hire-to-Retire lifecycle.

---

### **Summary Table:**

| Aspect                 | Model 1 | Model 2 |
|------------------------|---------|---------|
| Interviews required before decision |  No |  Yes |
| Screening before interviews         |  Yes |  No |
| Onboarding mandatory after decision |  Yes |  No |
| Payroll mandatory after onboarding  |  Yes |  No |
| Allows illogical looping            |  No  |  Yes |
| Skipping key hire steps              |  No  |  Yes |

---

**Final Answer:**
> Model 1 is closer to normative.  
> Its main anomaly is that interviews and hiring decisions can occur in parallel, allowing skipping interviews. Model 2, while correctly ordering interviews before decision, allows skipping onboarding and payroll entirely — severe anomalies that undermine the process's core purpose.

If you’d like, I can also **draw visual diagrams** of both models so the anomalies stand out clearly — would you like me to do that?
