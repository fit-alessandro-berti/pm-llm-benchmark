# BPMN-like Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

## Activities/Tasks:
1. **Receive Invoice:** Accounts Payable Clerk (AP) receives an invoice via email.
2. **Check Purchase Order (PO):** Verify if the invoice is associated with a valid PO.
3. **Send Back for Details:** If no PO, request additional information from the supplier.
4. **Log and Forward:** Log the invoice in the accounting system and forward it to the purchasing department for confirmation of goods/services receipt.
5. **Match Invoice to PO:** Compare invoice line items with the corresponding PO in the system.
6. **Request Manager Approval:** If all details match, send the invoice to the department manager for final approval.
7. **Investigate Discrepancies:** In case of discrepancies (e.g., incorrect pricing or missing items), contact the purchasing team and escalate if necessary.
8. **Manager Approval:** Department manager reviews the invoice, confirms details, and approves it.
9. **Payment Scheduling:** Accounts Payable schedules the invoice for payment after approval.
10. **Supplier Involvement (Indirect):** In case of issues, the Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM) might be looped in to resolve discrepancies or missing PO information.

## Sequence Flow:
- The process starts with receiving an invoice and proceeds through checking the PO, logging, and forwarding to purchasing for confirmation.
- From there, it moves to matching the invoice to the PO and requesting manager approval if all details are correct.
- Discrepancies lead to investigation, and manager approval is sought only after these issues are resolved.
- Once approved, the invoice goes to Accounts Payable for payment scheduling.
- The SRM is involved indirectly when needed to resolve specific issues with suppliers.

## Gateways/Decision Points:
- **PO Availability:** Decision point where AP checks if the invoice has a valid PO; if not, it sends back for details.
- **Discrepancy Resolution:** If discrepancies are found, a decision is made to either contact the supplier or ask for manager approval (if minor).
- **Manager Approval:** The system automatically requests approval after confirmation from purchasing, and the manager decides on approval or rejection.

## Roles/Participants:
- Accounts Payable Clerk (AP)
- Purchasing Officer (Dan)
- Department Manager
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
- Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)

## Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:
- **Input:** Invoices, purchase orders (POs), confirmation emails, supplier information.
- **Output:** Approved invoice for payment scheduling.

## Exceptions/Variations:
- In cases where invoices are missing PO numbers or have pricing discrepancies, the SRM is involved to address these exceptions by coordinating with suppliers and department heads.
- The Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) handles escalated issues that cannot be resolved directly by AP, ensuring they don't get stuck in the approval process.
- Department managers may occasionally reject invoices due to suspicious amounts or unexpected items, requiring further investigation.
