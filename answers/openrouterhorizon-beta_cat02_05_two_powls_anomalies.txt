Here’s a concise analysis of each model against a normative Hire-to-Retire flow (Post job  Screen candidates  Conduct interviews  Make decision  Onboard hired candidate  Add to payroll  Close case).

Model 1
Structure and behavior:
- Ordering: Post  Screen; from Screen, both Decide and Interview are enabled; Decide precedes Onboard  Payroll  Close. Interview is only constrained to occur after Screen; there is no constraint relating Interview to Decide (i.e., Decide may occur before, after, or without Interview).
Key anomalies:
1) Decision can be made before or without interviewing (Screen  Decide without Interview). This violates hiring logic where interviews inform the decision.
2) Interview can occur after the hiring decision (Interview concurrent/after Decide). That undermines decision validity.
3) No way to skip onboarding/payroll/close after a rejection. The model has a single path: once Decide fires, Onboard  Payroll  Close must follow. There is no branch for “reject candidate” or “close without onboarding/payroll,” so the decision effectively implies hire.
Severity:
- High: Decision-before-interview and mandatory onboarding/payroll irrespective of outcome are fundamental violations.
- Medium: Interview unconstrained relative to decision timing leads to nonsensical sequences.

Model 2
Structure and behavior:
- Partial order: Post precedes both Screen and Interview; Interview precedes Decide; Decide precedes loop_onboarding; then XOR(Payroll, skip)  Close.
- Loop_onboarding = Loop(Onboard, skip) means: at least one pass through Onboard, with optional repetitions (you do Onboard once, then either exit or do skip then Onboard again).
- xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip) means: either add to payroll or skip it.
Key anomalies:
1) Screening is not required before interviews or decision. Screen can occur in parallel with Interview and may even happen after or not at all before Decide. This weakens the pre-decision qualification step.
2) Onboarding is mandatory after any decision. There is no “reject” path; Decide always leads to at least one Onboard iteration. That implies every decision is a hire.
3) Payroll is optional after onboarding (XOR with skip). Normally, a hired/onboarded employee must be added to payroll. Skipping payroll after onboarding is a compliance/operational violation.
4) Multiple onboardings are possible (loop), which is unusual but could model iterative onboarding steps; still atypical unless explicitly intended.

Severity:
- High: Mandatory onboarding irrespective of decision outcome; optional payroll after onboarding.
- Medium: Screening not enforced before decision; repeated onboarding.

Which model is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire?
Model 2 is closer, despite its issues. Reasons:
- It enforces the crucial constraint that interviews precede the hiring decision (Interview  Decide). Model 1 allows Decide without Interview and even before Interview.
- Its anomalies (mandatory onboarding, optional payroll, weak screening prerequisite) are serious but more easily localized and fixable: enforce Screen  Interview  Decide, add a reject branch (skip onboarding/payroll when not hired), and require Payroll when hired.
- Model 1’s core control-flow defect conflates evaluation and selection: it permits decisions without interviews and forces onboarding/payroll regardless of outcome, with Interview temporally decoupled from Decide. This undermines process integrity more fundamentally.

Summary
- Model 1 anomalies: decision may precede or omit interviews; interview can occur post-decision; no reject path (onboarding/payroll always executed). More severe misalignment with hiring logic.
- Model 2 anomalies: screening not required before decision; onboarding forced after any decision; payroll optional; onboarding repeatable. Still, it preserves the key dependency Interview  Decide.
Therefore, Model 2 better aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process, mainly because it maintains the essential precedence that interviews inform the hiring decision.
