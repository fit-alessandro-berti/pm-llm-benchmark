What a treasure trove of process data!

From the provided process variants, I'll attempt to describe the underlying process. Please note that this is an interpretation, and some details might be subject to different explanations.

**Overall Process**

The process appears to be a multi-step approval workflow for employee-submitted declarations, which ultimately lead to payment requests. The process involves various roles, including:

1. Employee ( EMPLOYEE ): Submits declarations.
2. Administration ( ADMINISTRATION ): Approves or rejects declarations.
3. Pre-Approver ( PRE_APPROVER ): Approves or rejects declarations (in some cases).
4. Budget Owner ( BUDGET OWNER ): Approves or rejects declarations (in some cases).
5. Supervisor ( SUPERVISOR ): Approves or rejects declarations (in some cases).
6. Missing ( MISSING ): Rejects declarations (in some cases, but this role is unclear).

**Process Structure**

The process has several stages:

1. **Submission**: An employee submits a declaration.
2. **Approval/Rejection**: The declaration is reviewed and either approved or rejected by one or more of the following: Administration, Pre-Approver, Budget Owner, or Supervisor.
3. **Final Approval**: If approved, the declaration is finally approved by a Supervisor.
4. **Request Payment**: After final approval, a payment request is made.
5. **Payment Handling**: The payment request is handled ( Payment Handled).

**Loops and Repeat Steps**

Some process variants show repeat steps or loops, indicating that:

* Declarations can be resubmitted after rejection (e.g., by Administration or Supervisor).
* Approvals or rejections may require multiple iterations (e.g., between Administration and Employee).
* In some cases, the process restarts from the beginning after a rejection (e.g., when a Supervisor rejects a declaration).

**Edge Cases and Compared Variants**

Some variants represent edge cases or less common scenarios, such as:

* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION ->... (no further approvals or rejections).
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE (no further action).

Comparing these variants reveals differences in approval requirements, rejection handling, and roles involved.

**Performance and Frequency**

The provided performance and frequency data offer insights into process efficiency and commonality of specific paths. For example, variant 1 ( Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION ->... ) has the highest frequency (4618) and performance (810187.
