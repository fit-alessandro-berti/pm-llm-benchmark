Based on the provided data, the process described involves the handling of declarations and payments, with various approval and rejection steps. Here's a breakdown of the process and its variants:

1. **Initial Declaration Submission:**
   - The process starts with an employee submitting a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).

2. **Approval Pathways:**
   - **Simple Approval Path:** The declaration is approved by the administration (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION) and then by the supervisor (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
   - **Budget Owner Involvement:** The declaration is approved by the administration, then by the budget owner (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER), and finally by the supervisor (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
   - **Pre-Approver Involvement:** The declaration is approved by the pre-approver (Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER), then by the supervisor (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).

3. **Rejection Pathways:**
   - Declarations can be rejected at various stages, leading to resubmission and additional approval steps. Rejections can occur by:
     - Administration (Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION)
     - Supervisor (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR)
     - Budget Owner (Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER)
     - Pre-Approver (Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER)
     - Missing Information (Declaration REJECTED by MISSING)

4. **Payment Request and Handling:**
   - After the declaration is finally approved, a payment request is made (Request Payment), and the payment is handled (Payment Handled).

5. **Saved Declarations:**
   - Some declarations are saved by the employee but not submitted (Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE).

6. **Rejections Leading to No Payment:**
   - Declarations can be rejected and not resubmitted, leading to no payment (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE).

7. **Direct Payments:**
   - In some cases, declarations are directly approved by the supervisor without prior approval steps (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR), leading to a payment request and handling.

8. **High-Frequency Variants:**
   - The most frequent variants involve simple approval paths with or without budget owner involvement (e.g., frequency = 4618, frequency = 2473).

9. **Low-Frequency Variants:**
   - Less frequent variants involve multiple rejections and resubmissions (e.g., frequency = 4, 5, 6).

The performance values associated with each variant likely represent the cost or time associated with each process variant. The most expensive variants often involve multiple rejections and resubmissions.
