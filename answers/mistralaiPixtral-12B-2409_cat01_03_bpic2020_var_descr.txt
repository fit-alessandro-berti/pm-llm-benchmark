Based on the provided data, the process underlying this data seems to be a declaration and payment handling process with multiple approval steps and potential rejections. Here is a detailed description of the process variants:

1. **Standard Approval Process:**
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
     - This is the most frequent process variant with 4618 occurrences and a total performance of 810187.903.
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION** -> **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
     - This variant includes an additional approval step by the BUDGET OWNER with 2473 occurrences and a total performance of 1084338.407.
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
     - This variant skips the ADMINISTRATION approval step with 1392 occurrences and a total performance of 854633.975.
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
     - This variant includes an approval step by a PRE_APPROVER with 575 occurrences and a total performance of 861058.409.

2. **Rejection and Resubmission Process:**
   - Declarations can be rejected at various stages and then resubmitted. The rejection and resubmission process can occur multiple times before the declaration is finally approved and payment is handled. Some examples include:
     - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION** -> **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> ... -> **Payment Handled**
     - **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> ... -> **Payment Handled**
     - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER** -> **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> ... -> **Payment Handled**

3. **Saved Declarations:**
   - **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE** with 134 occurrences and no performance value.

4. **Direct Approval by SUPERVISOR:**
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
     - This variant skips the ADMINISTRATION approval step and goes directly to the SUPERVISOR for final approval with 40 occurrences and a total performance of 1947246.400.

5. **Rejection without Resubmission:**
   - Declarations can be rejected and not resubmitted, ending the process. Some examples include:
     - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION** with 5 occurrences and a total performance of 13805869.200.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER** -> **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** with 8 occurrences and a total performance of 71336.875.

In summary, the process involves submitting declarations, which can go through various approval steps, potentially be rejected, and resubmitted multiple times before finally being approved and handled for payment. The process also includes variants where declarations are directly approved by the SUPERVISOR or saved by the EMPLOYEE.
