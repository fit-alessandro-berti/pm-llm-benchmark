The hypothetical purchase-to-pay process can be represented by the following Python dictionary:

{('Purchase', 'Sale'): (504000, 1), ('Sales', 'Credit'): (3600, 1)}

This means that the average time between a Purchase and a Sale is 2 weeks, while the average time between a Sales and a Credit is also 1 week. The standard deviation for each pair is 1 week.
