## POWL Model Analysis

Let's break down both models and identify their anomalies compared to a standard Hire-to-Retire process:

**Model 1:**
* **Standard Sequence:** Generally follows a logical progression from posting a job ad through screening, interviews, decision-making, onboarding, payroll setup, and closing the case.
* **Anomaly:** No significant deviations from the norm. It follows a clear order with well-defined sequential steps.

**Model 2:**
* **Anomalies:**
    * **Looping Onboarding (loop_onboarding):** This introduces a loop where the "Onboard Employee" activity can repeat indefinitely after making a hiring decision. While this could represent exceptional cases, it deviates from the typical linear progression.
    * **XOR Decision Point (xor_payroll):** The use of an XOR operator means that only one of the Payroll and Skip activities will be executed at runtime. This creates ambiguity regarding whether the employee is added to the payroll system or the process immediately proceeds to closing the case after onboarding.  This anomaly introduces potential inconsistencies in the final state of the hiring process.

**Normative Model Selection:**

Model 1 more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process because it adheres to the standard order and logic. Model 2's anomalies, particularly the looping onboarding and ambiguous XOR decision point, introduce complexity that could lead to inconsistent or unexpected outcomes in practice.

**Justification:**

* **Model 1:**
    * Follows a straightforward sequential flow, ensuring logical progression through each stage of hiring.
    * Each activity is explicitly linked to its immediate predecessor, providing clear control over the process sequence.

* **Model 2:**
    * The loop introduces redundancy and potential confusion regarding when onboarding should occur in relation to payroll processing. 
    * The XOR operator creates ambiguity about the final steps after a hiring decision, potentially leading to inconsistent outcomes. 

While Model 1 may be more rigid, it avoids the complexities and potential issues introduced by Model 2's anomalies, making it a more reliable representation of a standard Hire-to-Retire process.
