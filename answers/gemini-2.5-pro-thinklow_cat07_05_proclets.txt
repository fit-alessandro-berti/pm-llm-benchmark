This is a comprehensive visualization that describes a business process in a healthcare setting using three different, complementary views: a process flow diagram, a class diagram, and an example message. The overall subject is the interaction between a lab visit and the subsequent lab tests.

Here is a detailed breakdown of each component:

### (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels

This is the main process flow diagram, depicting two interacting processes, referred to as "proclet classes": "Lab visit" and "Lab test".

*   **Lab Visit Process (Left Side):** This workflow is initiated by a **doctor** and primarily carried out by a **lab assistant**.
    1.  It begins with an "Order entry" by a doctor.
    2.  A lab assistant performs a "Take blood sample."
    3.  The process then waits to "Receive result" from the lab.
    4.  The lab assistant "Judge results."
    5.  Based on the judgment, there's a decision:
        *   If "Everything fine," the lab assistant will "Send report" and the process ends.
        *   If not, the process loops back to "Do tests again," which triggers another test, and waits to "Receive updated result."

*   **Lab Test Process (Right Side):** This workflow is handled by a **chemical analyst**.
    1.  It starts when a test is ordered.
    2.  The chemical analyst will "Perform test" and then "Make report."
    3.  The results are sent, and the process can either "Finish lab test" and end, or it may receive a request to "Perform test again" and "Provide updated report" before ending.

*   **Interaction Channels (Center):** The two processes are not independent; they communicate through two channels, depicted as dashed boxes.
    1.  **Order system:** The "Take blood sample" step in the "Lab visit" sends a message through the "Order system" to trigger the "Perform test" step in the "Lab test" process.
    2.  **HIS (Hospital Information System):** This channel is used for returning results. The "Make report" and "Provide updated report" steps in the "Lab test" process send information back to the "Receive result" and "Receive updated result" steps in the "Lab visit" process, respectively. It's also used by the "Lab visit" to request a re-test from the "Lab test" process.

### (b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes

This is a simple UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram that shows the structural relationship between the two main entities.

*   It contains two classes: **Lab visit** and **Lab test**.
*   A line labeled "requires" connects them, indicating their relationship.
*   The numbers (**1..1** and **1..***) are multiplicities. They signify that **one** "Lab visit" requires **one or more** "Lab tests". This reflects the logic in the process diagram where a single visit can result in an initial test and potentially one or more re-tests.

### (c) Example of a performative

This table provides a concrete example of a message (a "performative") being exchanged within the system, illustrating the communication in action.

*   **Time:** 11:00
*   **Channel:** The message is sent via the "Order system," which matches the top channel in diagram (a).
*   **Sender:** An instance of the "Lab visit" class, specifically for a patient named "John."
*   **Receivers:** An instance of the "Lab test" class, for a specific Hemoglobin "HGB" test.
*   **Action:** "Create," meaning this message is intended to initiate a new lab test.
*   **Content:** The actual message is "Can you perform a HGB test for John?".
*   **Scope & Direction:** It's a "Private" message and its direction is "OUT" from the sender's perspective.

In summary, the visualization provides a multi-layered description of a lab testing workflow. It shows the detailed sequence of actions and roles (a), the fundamental relationship between the core processes (b), and a concrete example of the communication that links them (c).
