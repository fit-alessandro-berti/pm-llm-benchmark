Sure! Here is an example of a POWL model for a Purchase-to-Pay process in Python using pm4py:
```
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities in the process
Place_order = Transition(label="Place order")
Receive_confirmation = Transition(label="Receive confirmation")
Check_order = Transition(label="Check order")
Approve_order = Transition(label="Approve order")
Receive_delivery = Transition(label="Receive delivery")
Check_delivery = Transition(label="Check delivery")
Make_payment = Transition(label="Make payment")

# Define a loop between Check_order and Approve_order, indicating that the order may need to be checked and approved multiple times before it is finalized
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Check_order, Approve_order])

# Define a choice between receiving delivery and checking delivery, indicating that the delivery may be checked before it is received or vice versa
choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Receive_delivery, Check_delivery])

# Define the overall process as a partial order, with the activities ordered as follows:
# - Place_order must be executed before Receive_confirmation
# - Receive_confirmation must be executed before the loop between Check_order and Approve_order
# - The loop between Check_order and Approve_order must be executed before choice between Receive_delivery and Check_delivery
# - The choice between Receive_delivery and Check_delivery must be executed before Make_payment

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Place_order, Receive_confirmation, loop, choice, Make_payment])
root.order.add_edge(Place_order, Receive_confirmation)
root.order.add_edge(Receive_confirmation, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, choice)
root.order.add_edge(choice, Make_payment)
```
This code defines a POWL model for a Purchase-to-Pay process that includes the following activities: placing an order, receiving a confirmation, checking the order, approving the order, receiving a delivery, checking the delivery, and making a payment. It also includes a loop between the checking and approving of the order, indicating that these activities may need to be repeated multiple times before the order is finalized. Additionally, it includes a choice between receiving and checking the delivery, indicating that the delivery may be checked before it is received or vice versa. The overall process is defined as a partial order, with the activities ordered as specified in the comments above.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
