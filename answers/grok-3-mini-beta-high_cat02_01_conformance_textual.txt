First, I need to understand the normative process from the textual description. Let me summarize the key points:

- The process always starts with "Receive order".

- Next is "Check inventory".

- If inventory is sufficient:

  - Then "Authorize payment"

  - Then "Package items"

  - Then "Ship order"

  - Finally "Close order"

  Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package  Ship  Close

- If inventory is insufficient:

  - Then "Cancel order"

  - Then "Close order"

  Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close

Key constraints:

- "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items".

- "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order".

- "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items" and never after a cancellation.

- "Close order" should be the final activity in all scenarios.

- No activities should happen after cancellation except "Close order".

- Deviations like shipping after cancellation, authorizing payment before checking inventory, or packaging before authorization are violations.

Now, I have the event log with 5 cases. I need to check each case against this normative flow and identify deviations.

Let's list out the activities for each case:

- Case 1: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

- Case 2: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

- Case 3: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

- Case 4: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

- Case 5: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

Now, compare each to the normative paths.

Start with Case 1:

- Follows exactly the sufficient inventory path: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close

- No deviations. Should be compliant.

Case 2:

- Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close

- According to constraints:

  - "Authorize payment" should be before "Package items". Here, "Package items" happens before "Authorize payment". This violates the rule that payment should be authorized before packaging.

  - Also, "Package items" should only occur after authorization.

- So, violation in the order of "Package items" and "Authorize payment".

Case 3:

- Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close

- After "Check inventory", it has "Authorize payment" and then "Cancel order". But the normative description says that if inventory is insufficient, it should go directly to "Cancel order". Here, "Authorize payment" is done before cancellation, which might imply that inventory was checked and found insufficient, but payment was authorized anyway.

- More critically, after "Cancel order", it has "Ship order", which is a violation because "Ship order" should never occur after cancellation.

- Also, in the cancellation scenario, only "Cancel" and then "Close" should happen, no fulfillment activities.

- So, violations: Authorizing payment when inventory might be insufficient (inferred from cancellation), and shipping after cancellation.

- The description doesn't explicitly say that "Authorize payment" should only happen if inventory is sufficient, but it implies that payment authorization is part of the sufficient inventory path. In the cancellation path, it shouldn't happen.

- Clearly, "Ship order" after "Cancel order" is a direct violation.

Case 4:

- Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close

- This matches the insufficient inventory path perfectly.

- No deviations. Should be compliant.

Case 5:

- Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close

- Missing "Package items" before "Ship order".

- Constraint: "Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping, and "Ship order" should only occur after packaging.

- Here, "Ship order" happens without "Package items" being done. This is a violation.

- Also, the full sequence is not followed; "Package items" is skipped.

Now, summarizing the violations:

- Case 1: No violation

- Case 2: Violation - "Package items" before "Authorize payment"

- Case 3: Violations - "Ship order" after "Cancel order", and possibly "Authorize payment" before cancellation when it shouldn't be done.

- Case 4: No violation

- Case 5: Violation - "Ship order" without prior "Package items"

I need to identify which cases deviate and explain the violations.

Cases that deviate: 2, 3, and 5.

Explanations:

- For Case 2: The activity "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment", violating the rule that payment must be authorized before items are packaged. According to the description, "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items".

- For Case 3: After "Cancel order", "Ship order" is performed, which is a clear violation as shipping should never occur after cancellation. Additionally, "Authorize payment" is done before cancellation, which may not align with the intended flow where payment authorization is only for sufficient inventory cases.

- For Case 5: "Ship order" is executed without the preceding "Package items" activity, breaking the sequence where items must be packaged before shipping.

Now, for ambiguities: The description says "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory", which all cases seem to follow. In Case 3, "Authorize payment" happens after check but before cancel, which might be interpreted as a mistake if cancel implies insufficient inventory. I think it's safe to consider it a violation based on the implied paths.

Also, in Case 5, the missing "Package items" is a clear deviation.

Finally, structure the response:

1. List the cases that violate: Cases 2, 3, and 5.

2. Explain each violation with reference to the description.

### Analysis of Event Log Deviations from Normative Process

Based on the provided normative process description, I have analyzed each case in the event log to identify deviations from the intended process flow. The normative description outlines two primary paths: one for sufficient inventory (Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package  Ship  Close) and one for insufficient inventory (Receive  Check  Cancel  Close). Key constraints include:
- "Check inventory" must precede "Authorize payment" and any fulfillment activities.
- "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items".
- "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order".
- "Ship order" must only occur after "Package items" and never after "Cancel order".
- "Close order" must be the final activity, and no fulfillment activities (e.g., "Package items" or "Ship order") should occur after "Cancel order".
- The process always starts with "Receive order".

Ambiguities in the description were resolved as follows:
- The description implies that "Authorize payment" is only appropriate in the sufficient inventory path, as it is tied to the decision to proceed with fulfillment. Therefore, authorizing payment in a case that leads to cancellation may be considered a violation, as it deviates from the logical branching.
- The sequences are described as strict, with no indication of optional steps or alternative orders, so any deviation from the specified orders or missing steps in the fulfillment path is treated as a violation.

After reviewing all five cases, I identified deviations in **Cases 2, 3, and 5**. Case 1 and Case 4 adhere to the normative process and are not discussed further. Below, I list the violating cases, explain the specific violations, and reference the relevant parts of the normative description.

#### Cases with Deviations
1. **Case 2**
   - **Sequence of Activities**: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
   - **Violations Identified**:
     - **Violation of order between "Authorize payment" and "Package items"**: In this case, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment". The normative description explicitly states that "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items", as payment authorization ensures the customer's payment method is valid and approved before preparing items for shipment. Packaging items before authorization could lead to unnecessary preparation if payment fails, which contradicts the intended flow.
     - **Explanation and Interpretation**: The description emphasizes that "Package items" should only occur after authorization, as this step depends on confirming payment validity. This deviation suggests a logical error in the process execution, potentially increasing risks like wasted resources. While the description allows some interpretation (e.g., whether authorization could be delayed in rare cases), the clear sequencing guideline resolves this ambiguity in favor of strict adherence, making this a violation.

2. **Case 3**
   - **Sequence of Activities**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order
   - **Violations Identified**:
     - **Shipping after cancellation**: The activity "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order", which directly violates the constraint that "Ship order" should never occur after a cancellation. The normative description states that once an order is canceled, it is illogical to continue with fulfillment activities like shipping, and the process should only proceed to "Close order".
     - **Potential misuse of "Authorize payment" in a cancellation path**: "Authorize payment" is performed before "Cancel order", which may indicate that payment was authorized even though the inventory was insufficient (inferred from the subsequent cancellation). The description implies that "Authorize payment" is part of the sufficient inventory path and should not occur if the process branches to cancellation, as it only makes sense when fulfillment is possible.
     - **Explanation and Interpretation**: The primary violation is the "Ship order" after "Cancel order", which is unambiguously prohibited. Regarding the "Authorize payment" step, the description's branching logic (sufficient vs. insufficient inventory) suggests that authorization should not happen if cancellation is imminent, as this could lead to unnecessary financial transactions. I resolved this ambiguity by interpreting the description's emphasis on logical progression: authorization is tied to the decision to fulfill, so its occurrence before cancellation is a deviation from the intended constraints.

3. **Case 5**
   - **Sequence of Activities**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
   - **Violations Identified**:
     - **Missing "Package items" before "Ship order"**: The activity "Ship order" occurs without the preceding "Package items" step. The normative description specifies that "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order", as items need to be prepared before they can be shipped. Skipping this step breaks the expected sequence.
     - **Explanation and Interpretation**: The description clearly outlines that "Ship order" should only occur after packaging, ensuring that items are properly prepared for delivery. This deviation could result in shipping incomplete or unprepared orders, violating the process's emphasis on a logical and sequential flow. There is no ambiguity here, as the description explicitly defines the order of fulfillment activities.

#### Summary of Compliant Cases
- **Case 1**: Fully adheres to the sufficient inventory path (Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package  Ship  Close). No violations.
- **Case 4**: Fully adheres to the insufficient inventory path (Receive  Check  Cancel  Close). No violations.

In conclusion, the cases that deviate from the normative process are **2, 3, and 5**. These deviations highlight issues such as incorrect ordering of activities, missing steps, and inappropriate execution of fulfillment activities in cancellation scenarios. By adhering closely to the textual description and resolving ambiguities through logical inference (e.g., treating authorization as path-dependent), I ensured a consistent evaluation. If additional context or clarifications were available, they could refine this analysis further.
