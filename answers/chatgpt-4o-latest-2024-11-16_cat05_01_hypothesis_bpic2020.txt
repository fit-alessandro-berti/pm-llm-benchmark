Here’s a set of 20 relevant questions derived from the process you'd like to explore, accompanied by confidence scores based on how pertinent the question is likely to be for analyzing the efficiency, bottlenecks, and variations within the process.

### 1. **What are the main differences in performance between cases that involve multiple approvals (like by Budget Owner, Supervisor, etc.) versus those that go through a more streamlined process?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 9.7  
     *Reason*: Analyzing this could highlight process inefficiencies in variants with additional approval layers.

### 2. **What process variants have the highest performance time, and what factors contribute to those delays?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 9.5  
     *Reason*: Understanding performance lag causes can significantly improve throughput times within the process.

### 3. **Is there a correlation between the number of approval steps and the likelihood of rejection in the case of budget owners versus supervisors?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 9.2  
     *Reason*: Evaluating whether certain approval steps, such as Budget Owners or PRE_APPROVER, lead to more rejections can highlight inefficiency or policy conflicts.

### 4. **What steps typically follow a rejected declaration, and how does this affect the overall performance of the process?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 9.5  
     *Reason*: Rejections clearly add time and complexity. Understanding the rejected process flow illuminates improvement potential.

### 5. **How many times, on average, does a declaration get resubmitted after being rejected, and how does this impact the total performance time?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.8  
     *Reason*: Multiple rejections drive inefficiency, and understanding the impact of rejection resubmission processes is key.

### 6. **What’s the average performance time for declarations that are processed without any "REJECTED" states compared to those that face rejections?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 9.6  
     *Reason*: Comparing rejection-related performance delays is essential for understanding bottlenecks.

### 7. **Which roles (ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER) are responsible for most of the rejections, and why?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 9.0  
     *Reason*: Knowing where most rejections come from helps pinpoint which part of the process or department is creating delays.

### 8. **Are there differences in performance for cases that go through "Request Payment" and get "Payment Handled" faster or slower than average?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.9  
     *Reason*: Focuses on improving the speed at which payment requests are handled, which is the goal of the process.

### 9. **What is the frequency of cases being rejected in sequence multiple times (3 or more iterations of rejection and submission) and how costly is this in terms of performance?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 9.0  
     *Reason*: Sequential rejections create a serious process inefficiency, and quantifying this issue is key.

### 10. **How often does the final step "Payment Handled" correlate with a long performance time, compared to the overall workflow?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.5  
     *Reason*: If the final step has long delays, this could hinder the overall efficiency, so understanding its root causes is critical.

### 11. **What impact do "MISSING" rejections have on the performance of the process, and how frequently does this occur?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.2  
     *Reason*: The "MISSING" state seems to be an anomaly. Understanding its cause and frequency may reveal shortcomings in reporting or data entry.

### 12. **What is the relationship between "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" and eventual declaration submission (or rejection) performance timelines?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.0  
     *Reason*: Although saving does not affect performance directly, analyzing it could show delays where employees pause before submission.

### 13. **How do performance times vary based on whether a declaration is "Approved by Pre-approver" compared to "Approved by Administration"?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.3  
     *Reason*: Understanding if earlier steps (like PRE_APPROVER) impact the next steps will help optimize role allocations.

### 14. **How effective is the current routing (roles in approval pathways) in reducing the number of iteration loops in the process?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.9  
     *Reason*: Evaluating whether different approval routes lead to faster or more frequent iterations may improve the allocation of approvers.

### 15. **Is there a direct relationship between the complexity of the approval chain (higher number of approval roles) and the likelihood of rejection?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.7  
     *Reason*: A more complex approval chain might lead to greater rejections, undermining efficiency.

### 16. **Does intervention by multiple approvers (e.g., PRE_APPROVER, EMPLOYEE, BUDGET OWNER) unnecessarily complicate the flow of declarations?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.5  
     *Reason*: Understanding if certain additional approval steps are burdensome is important to streamline the process.

### 17. **For declarations rejected by ADMINISTRATION: does the department or type of employee correlate with higher rejection rates?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 7.9  
     *Reason*: Differentiating between employee types or departments may highlight areas for training or clarification of policy.

### 18. **What is the average time between a declaration being approved by the final approver (typically SUPERVISOR) and the request for payment?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.4  
     *Reason*: Any unnecessary delays between approval and payment request reflect inefficiency that should be addressed.

### 19. **Are there certain types of declarations that have a higher frequency of rejection in the initial steps (e.g., PRE_APPROVER vs. ADMINISTRATION)?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.6  
     *Reason*: Identifying declaration types with higher rejection rates can spotlight categories causing delays.

### 20. **Is there a significant performance difference between declarations rejected once and resubmitted versus those rejected multiple times?**
   - **Confidence Score**: 8.8  
     *Reason*: Understanding this helps quantify how much multiple iterations of resubmission degrade performance efficiency.

### Interpretation of Confidence Scores:

- **9.0+**: Highly relevant questions that directly explore root causes of inefficiency, rework, or bottlenecks.
- **8.0-8.9**: Relevant, but either slightly less priority or more exploratory in nature; still important for process analysis.
- **Below 8**: Important, but somewhat speculative or indirectly related to process inefficiencies, often regarding specific cases.

This suite of questions is designed to help you explore the key elements of the process to identify inefficiencies, target rework, and potentially increase the overall performance and quality of operations.
