<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to add constraints to a DECLARE model to mitigate bias in a loan application process. First, I need to understand the existing model and the possible biases. 

The example model includes activities like StartApplication, FinalDecision, RequestAdditionalInfo. The constraints are things like existence, response, succession. The task is to add new constraints that prevent biased decisions based on sensitive attributes like ApplicantAge, ApplicantGender, ApplicantRace.

So, the first step is to identify where bias could occur. For example, if a sensitive attribute is checked (like CheckApplicantRace), then a decision (like Reject) shouldn't immediately follow without a bias mitigation check. Also, if a decision is made for a sensitive applicant, there should be a ManualReview coexisting. 

Let me think about the constraints. The user mentioned coexistence, response, succession, non-succession. 

For coexistence: If a decision (like Approve_Minority) occurs, then ManualReview must coexist. Wait, but the existing model doesn't have these specific activities. Wait, the original model has FinalDecision. But maybe the user wants to introduce new activities like ManualReview, BiasMitigationCheck, and then link them. However, the initial model doesn't have these. Wait, the original example model's existence includes StartApplication and FinalDecision. But the user's instruction says to add constraints that ensure that, for example, if a decision step occurs for a sensitive applicant, ManualReview coexists. 

Wait, but how do we model the sensitive attributes? Maybe the sensitive attributes are activities themselves? Or are they part of the process? The problem states that the process might be influenced by sensitive attributes, so perhaps the activities that check these attributes (like CheckApplicantRace) are part of the process. Then, the decision activities (like Approve, Reject) should not follow directly from these checks without a mitigation step.

So, the user wants to add constraints that prevent biased outcomes. Let me think of possible new constraints.

First, coexistence: If a decision activity (like FinalDecision) is made for a sensitive applicant (maybe represented by an activity like CheckApplicantRace), then ManualReview must coexist. Wait, but how do we represent that? Maybe if CheckApplicantRace is present, then ManualReview must be present. But coexistence is a constraint that two activities must coexist in the process. So, adding a coexistence constraint between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview? Or perhaps between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview, ensuring that if CheckApplicantRace is present, ManualReview is also present. But the coexistence constraint in DECLARE requires that two activities coexist. Wait, the DECLARE coexistence constraint is for two activities to appear together in a trace. So, maybe adding coexistence between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview. But that might not be sufficient. Alternatively, if a decision activity (like FinalDecision) occurs after a sensitive attribute check (CheckApplicantRace), then there must be a ManualReview in between. 

Alternatively, the user's instruction says that if a decision step occurs for a sensitive applicant (like Approve_Minority), then ManualReview must coexist. But the original model's existence includes FinalDecision. So maybe we need to add new activities like CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, BiasMitigationCheck, etc. But the original model doesn't have these. Wait, the initial model has StartApplication and FinalDecision. The user's example model includes a response from StartApplication to RequestAdditionalInfo, and succession from RequestAdditionalInfo to FinalDecision. 

So, the user is probably expecting that the new constraints involve existing activities but with the sensitive attributes. Wait, perhaps the sensitive attributes are part of the activities. For example, maybe the activities are like CheckApplicantRace, which is a step that checks the applicant's race. Then, the decision steps (like Approve, Reject) should not follow directly from CheckApplicantRace without a BiasMitigationCheck. 

So, the user wants to add constraints that prevent certain sequences. For example, a non-succession constraint between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision, because that would mean that CheckApplicantRace cannot be followed directly by FinalDecision. Instead, there must be a BiasMitigationCheck in between. 

Alternatively, the user might want to add a response constraint where CheckApplicantRace must be followed by BiasMitigationCheck before any decision. 

So, possible new constraints:

1. Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision. This would prevent CheckApplicantRace from being followed directly by FinalDecision. 

2. A response constraint where CheckApplicantRace must be followed by BiasMitigationCheck. 

3. Coexistence between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview. 

Wait, but the user's example model doesn't have these activities. So maybe the user expects that the existing activities are modified to include these sensitive attributes. Wait, perhaps the existing activities are already part of the process, and the sensitive attributes are part of the process steps. For example, maybe the StartApplication includes checking for sensitive attributes, but that's unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the activities that represent sensitive attributes are new. For example, CheckApplicantRace, CheckApplicantGender, etc. Then, the constraints would involve these activities. 

But the original model's existence includes StartApplication and FinalDecision. So, the user is probably expecting that we add new activities and constraints. However, the user's instructions say to add constraints to the existing model, not necessarily to add new activities. Wait, the user says "add new constraints that limit the process’s bias." So, perhaps the existing activities are part of the process, and the sensitive attributes are part of the process steps. For example, maybe the StartApplication includes checking for sensitive attributes, but that's not clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the sensitive attributes are part of the activities. For example, the FinalDecision might have different versions based on sensitive attributes, like FinalDecision_Approve_Minority. But that's getting complicated. 

Alternatively, the user wants to model that certain activities (like CheckApplicantRace) must be present before a decision. So, adding constraints that if a sensitive attribute is checked (CheckApplicantRace), then a BiasMitigationCheck must occur. 

But since the original model doesn't have these activities, perhaps the user expects that we can add them. Wait, the initial model has StartApplication and FinalDecision. So, maybe the user is assuming that these are the activities, and the sensitive attributes are part of the process. For example, maybe the StartApplication includes checking for sensitive attributes, but that's not clear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting that the existing activities (like StartApplication) are part of the process, and the sensitive attributes are part of the constraints. For example, adding constraints that prevent certain sequences involving the existing activities. 

Wait, the user's example includes a response from StartApplication to RequestAdditionalInfo, and succession from RequestAdditionalInfo to FinalDecision. So, maybe the sensitive attributes are part of the activities. For example, maybe the StartApplication includes checking for sensitive attributes, and the decision is influenced by that. 

But the user wants to add constraints to prevent biased decisions. For example, if a sensitive attribute is checked (like CheckApplicantRace), then a BiasMitigationCheck must occur before a decision. 

But since the original model doesn't have these activities, perhaps the user expects that we add them. However, the user's instructions say to add constraints to the existing model, not to add new activities. 

Wait, the user says: "add new constraints that limit the process’s bias." So, the existing activities are part of the process, and the sensitive attributes are part of the process steps. For example, maybe the StartApplication is a step that includes checking for sensitive attributes, but that's not clear. 

Alternatively, the user is thinking of the process as having activities that are influenced by sensitive attributes. For example, a decision activity (like FinalDecision) could be influenced by the presence of a sensitive attribute. The constraints would ensure that such decisions are not made without proper checks. 

So, perhaps the idea is to add constraints that prevent certain sequences. For example, if a sensitive attribute is checked (like CheckApplicantRace), then a BiasMitigationCheck must be done before any decision. 

But since the original model doesn't have these activities, maybe we need to add them. But the user hasn't specified that. Wait, the user's example model includes activities like StartApplication and FinalDecision. So, perhaps the sensitive attributes are not activities but are part of the process's context. 

Alternatively, the user is thinking that the existing activities (like StartApplication, RequestAdditionalInfo, FinalDecision) are influenced by sensitive attributes. For example, the FinalDecision might be biased if certain attributes are present. 

But how to model that in DECLARE constraints? 

The user's instruction says that the constraints should ensure that any decision steps cannot immediately follow or be preceded by events where a sensitive attribute leads to a biased outcome. 

So, for example, if a sensitive attribute is present (like CheckApplicantRace), then a decision (like FinalDecision) cannot immediately follow without a BiasMitigationCheck. 

But the original model doesn't have CheckApplicantRace or BiasMitigationCheck. So, perhaps the user expects that we can add these as new activities. 

But the initial model's existence includes StartApplication and FinalDecision. So, maybe the user is assuming that these are the only activities, and the sensitive attributes are part of the process's context. For example, the StartApplication might include checking for sensitive attributes, and the decision is made based on that. 

But that's not clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking that the existing activities (like StartApplication) are part of the process, and the sensitive attributes are part of the process's data, not activities. So, the constraints would be about the sequence of activities, not the data. 

But the user's example includes a response from StartApplication to RequestAdditionalInfo, and succession from RequestAdditionalInfo to FinalDecision. 

So, the user wants to add constraints that prevent certain sequences. For example, a non-succession constraint between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision. But since CheckApplicantRace is not in the original model, perhaps the user is thinking of existing activities as part of the sensitive attributes. 

Alternatively, the user is thinking that the existing activities (like StartApplication) are influenced by sensitive attributes, and the constraints should prevent certain sequences. 

This is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the user's instructions. 

The user says: "Suppose the underlying process is a loan application review in which certain decisions (e.g., Approve, Reject, RequestAdditionalInfo) might be influenced by sensitive attributes (such as ApplicantAge, ApplicantGender, ApplicantRace). You must introduce constraints that ensure that the sequence of activities does not discriminate based on these attributes."

Ah, the sensitive attributes are factors that influence the decisions, but the activities themselves are the steps in the process. So, the constraints need to ensure that the sequence of activities doesn't allow for biased decisions based on these attributes. 

For example, if a sensitive attribute is present (like ApplicantRace: Minority), then the decision step (like Reject) shouldn't immediately follow without a mitigation check. 

But how to model that in the DECLARE constraints. 

The user's example model has activities like StartApplication, RequestAdditionalInfo, FinalDecision. So, perhaps the sensitive attributes are part of the process, and the constraints are about the sequence of these activities. 

For instance, if the process includes a CheckApplicantRace activity (which is not in the original model), then the FinalDecision shouldn't follow directly. But since the original model doesn't have CheckApplicantRace, maybe the user expects that we can add it as a new activity. 

But the user's instructions say to add constraints to the existing model. So maybe the existing activities are considered to be part of the process, and the sensitive attributes are part of the process's data. 

Alternatively, the user wants to add constraints that prevent certain sequences involving existing activities. For example, if a decision (like FinalDecision) is preceded by an activity that could be influenced by a sensitive attribute (like StartApplication), then there must be a mitigation step. 

But this is unclear. 

Alternatively, the user is thinking that the existing activities (like StartApplication, RequestAdditionalInfo, FinalDecision) are steps that could be influenced by sensitive attributes. For example, the StartApplication might involve checking for sensitive attributes, and the FinalDecision is influenced by those attributes. 

But how to model that in DECLARE constraints. 

The user's example includes a response from StartApplication to RequestAdditionalInfo, and succession from RequestAdditionalInfo to FinalDecision. 

So, the user wants to add constraints that prevent certain sequences. For example, a non-succession constraint between StartApplication and FinalDecision, to ensure that FinalDecision isn't directly after StartApplication without a check. 

But that's just a guess. 

Alternatively, the user wants to ensure that any decision (like FinalDecision) is preceded by a check for sensitive attributes. So, adding a precedence constraint that CheckApplicantRace must precede FinalDecision. But again, the original model doesn't have CheckApplicantRace. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the user expects that the existing activities are part of the process, and the sensitive attributes are part of the process's context, and the constraints are about the sequence of these activities. 

For example, the user wants to add a constraint that if a decision activity (like FinalDecision) occurs, then a ManualReview activity must also occur. So, coexistence between FinalDecision and ManualReview. 

But the original model doesn't have ManualReview. So, adding that as a new activity. 

But the user's instructions say to add constraints to the existing model, not to add new activities. 

Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the existing activities as being influenced by sensitive attributes, and the constraints are about the sequence of these activities. For example, if the StartApplication is followed by FinalDecision without any checks, that's a bias. So, adding a constraint that StartApplication must be followed by a ManualReview before FinalDecision. 

But the original model has a succession from RequestAdditionalInfo to FinalDecision. 

So, perhaps the user wants to add constraints that ensure that decisions are preceded by checks. For example, adding a precedence constraint that ManualReview must precede FinalDecision. 

But the original model doesn't have ManualReview. 

I think I need to make some assumptions here. Let's proceed. 

Assuming that the sensitive attributes are part of the process and that there are new activities like CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, BiasMitigationCheck, etc. 

So, adding these activities to the model and then adding constraints that prevent biased sequences. 

But the user's initial model doesn't include these activities. However, the user's instructions say to add constraints, not necessarily new activities. 

Alternatively, maybe the existing activities are considered to be part of the process, and the sensitive attributes are part of the process's data. For example, the StartApplication is a step that could be influenced by sensitive attributes. 

But without knowing how to represent that in the model, it's hard to proceed. 

Given that, perhaps the user expects that we can add new activities and constraints. 

So, let's proceed under that assumption. 

Let's say that the process includes activities like CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, BiasMitigationCheck, and the existing activities like StartApplication, RequestAdditionalInfo, FinalDecision. 

Then, the constraints would be:

- Coexistence between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview: if CheckApplicantRace is present, ManualReview must be present. 

- Response from CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck: CheckApplicantRace must be followed by BiasMitigationCheck. 

- Non-succession from CheckApplicantRace to FinalDecision: CheckApplicantRace cannot be followed directly by FinalDecision. 

- Precedence of BiasMitigationCheck before FinalDecision: BiasMitigationCheck must come before FinalDecision. 

But since the original model doesn't have these activities, I need to add them to the declare_model. 

But the user's example model includes only StartApplication, FinalDecision, etc. So, adding new activities would be part of the updated model. 

So, the updated declare_model would include these new activities. 

Now, the user's instructions say to add new constraints. So, for each new constraint, I need to add it to the appropriate key in the dictionary. 

For example, for the coexistence between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview, I would add a coexistence constraint. 

But the user's example has coexistence as a key, with a dictionary mapping activities to another activity. 

Wait, the coexistence constraint in DECLARE requires that two activities coexist. So, the coexistence key would have entries like:

"coexistence": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    ...
}

But in the example model, coexistence has "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": ...}, which suggests that the structure for coexistence is a dictionary where each activity maps to another activity with the support and confidence. 

Wait, no. Looking at the example model:

"coexistence": {
    "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
}

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, the example model's coexistence key has "StartApplication" as the key, and the value is {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the structure for coexistence is that each activity in the dictionary is a pair of activities that must coexist. 

Wait, no. The DECLARE language has different constraints. For example, for coexistence, the constraint is that two activities must coexist. So, for coexistence, the structure would be a dictionary where each entry is a pair of activities. 

But in the example model, the coexistence key has "StartApplication" as the key, and the value is {"FinalDecision": ...}, which seems incorrect. Maybe the example model has a typo or is not correctly formatted. 

Wait, the example model's coexistence is:

"coexistence": {
    "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
}

But this structure doesn't match the DECLARE constraint format. For example, in DECLARE, coexistence would require that two activities coexist. So, perhaps the correct structure is that each entry in the coexistence dictionary is a pair of activities, like:

"coexistence": {
    "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    ...
}

But this is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the structure for coexistence is that each entry is an activity, and the value is a dictionary of other activities that must coexist with it. 

This is confusing. Let me refer back to the user's instructions. 

The user says: For binary constraints (like `response`), the dictionary maps an activity to another activity’s dictionary, setting `"support": 1.0` and `"confidence": 1.0` for each link. 

So, for a binary constraint like `response`, the structure is:

"response": {
    "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
}

Which means that StartApplication responds to RequestAdditionalInfo. 

Similarly, for `coexistence`, the structure might be that each activity is mapped to another activity that must coexist. But the example model shows that "coexistence" has "StartApplication" as the key, and the value is {"FinalDecision": ...}, which would mean that StartApplication and FinalDecision must coexist. 

But this seems like a single pair. So, for coexistence, the structure is a dictionary where each key is an activity, and the value is another activity that must coexist with it. But that would mean that if StartApplication is present, FinalDecision must be present. 

Alternatively, coexistence could require that two activities must appear together in the process. So, the coexistence key would have entries like:

"coexistence": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    ...
}

Which would mean that CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview must coexist. 

So, adding such entries. 

Now, back to the problem. The user wants to add constraints that prevent biased decisions. 

Let me think of possible constraints:

1. Coexistence between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview: If CheckApplicantRace is present, ManualReview must also be present. 

2. Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision: CheckApplicantRace cannot be followed directly by FinalDecision. 

3. Response from CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck: CheckApplicantRace must be followed by BiasMitigationCheck. 

4. Precedence of BiasMitigationCheck before FinalDecision: BiasMitigationCheck must come before FinalDecision. 

But since the original model doesn't have these activities, I need to add them to the declare_model. 

So, the updated declare_model will have these new activities and the new constraints. 

Now, the user's instructions say to preserve the format. For unary constraints, map activities to {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}. For binary constraints, map an activity to another activity's dictionary. 

So, for example, adding a coexistence constraint between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview would be added to the coexistence key as:

"coexistence": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    ...
}

Similarly, non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision would be added to the nonsuccession key:

"nonsuccession": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    ...
}

But wait, the nonsuccession constraint in DECLARE is for two activities that cannot succeed each other. So, the nonsuccession key would have entries where the first activity cannot be followed by the second. 

So, adding "CheckApplicantRace" to "FinalDecision" in nonsuccession would mean that CheckApplicantRace cannot be succeeded by FinalDecision. 

Similarly, adding a response from CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck would be under the response key:

"response": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    ...
}

And a precedence constraint between BiasMitigationCheck and FinalDecision would be under precedence:

"precedence": {
    "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    ...
}

Also, coexistence between FinalDecision and ManualReview would be added to coexistence:

"coexistence": {
    "FinalDecision": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    ...
}

But I need to ensure that these new activities are added to the existence key if they are part of the process. 

For example, if CheckApplicantRace is a new activity, it should be added to the existence key with support and confidence 1.0. 

So, the existence key would have:

"existence": {
    "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
}

Similarly, for other constraints. 

Now, putting this all together, the updated declare_model would include these new activities and constraints. 

But the user's initial model doesn't have these activities, but the user's instructions say to add constraints, not necessarily to add activities. However, to enforce the constraints, the activities need to be part of the model. 

So, the final answer will include the new activities and the constraints. 

Now, the user's instructions also mention that the added constraints should be documented with a rationale. 

So, the added constraints would be:

1. Coexistence between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview: Ensures that when sensitive attributes are checked, a manual review is also part of the process, preventing bias by requiring human oversight.

2. Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision: Prevents immediate decisions after checking sensitive attributes, ensuring that there's a mitigation step in between.

3. Response from CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck: Ensures that after checking sensitive attributes, a bias mitigation check is performed before any decision.

4. Precedence of BiasMitigationCheck before FinalDecision: Ensures that the bias mitigation check is done before the final decision, preventing decisions based on sensitive attributes without proper checks.

These constraints collectively ensure that decisions are not made based on sensitive attributes without proper checks, thereby reducing bias.

Now, translating this into the declare_model dictionary. 

The existence key will include the new activities. 

The coexistence key will have the coexistence constraint between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview. 

The nonsuccession key will have the non-succession constraint between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision. 

The response key will have the response from CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck. 

The precedence key will have the precedence from BiasMitigationCheck to FinalDecision. 

Other keys like absence, exactly_one, etc., remain as in the original model. 

So, the updated declare_model would look like this:

{
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}

Wait, the original model has the succession from RequestAdditionalInfo to FinalDecision. So, that should be kept. 

Also, the nonsuccession key now includes CheckApplicantRace to FinalDecision. 

Additionally, the coexistence and response and precedence keys have the new constraints. 

Now, the rationale for each added constraint:

- Coexistence between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview: Ensures that when sensitive attributes are checked, a manual review is required, preventing biased decisions by requiring human oversight.

- Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision: Prevents immediate decisions after checking sensitive attributes, ensuring a mitigation check is performed first.

- Response from CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck: Ensures that after checking sensitive attributes, a bias mitigation check is conducted before any decision.

- Precedence of BiasMitigationCheck before FinalDecision: Ensures that the bias mitigation check is completed before the final decision, preventing decisions based on sensitive attributes without proper checks.

These constraints collectively reduce bias by ensuring that decisions are not made on the basis of sensitive attributes without appropriate checks and oversight.

**Rationale for Added Constraints:**

1. **Coexistence (CheckApplicantRace  ManualReview):**  
   Ensures that when sensitive attributes (e.g., ApplicantRace) are checked, a manual review is always required. This enforces human oversight to prevent algorithmic bias in decisions.

2. **Response (CheckApplicantRace  BiasMitigationCheck):**  
   Prevents decisions based on sensitive attributes without a dedicated bias mitigation step. This forces the process to include checks that explicitly address potential discrimination.

3. **Precedence (BiasMitigationCheck  FinalDecision):**  
   Guarantees that bias mitigation checks occur before final decisions. This ensures decisions are not made on sensitive attributes without proper validation.

4. **Non-succession (CheckApplicantRace  FinalDecision):**  
   Blocks direct transitions from sensitive attribute checks to final decisions, enforcing mandatory intermediate steps to reduce the risk of biased outcomes. 

These constraints collectively reduce bias by ensuring decisions are not influenced by sensitive attributes without oversight or mitigation.
