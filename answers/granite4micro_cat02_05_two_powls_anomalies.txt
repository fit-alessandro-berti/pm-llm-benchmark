To address this task, we need to analyze both provided POWL models against the expected sequence of activities in a standard "Hire-to-Retire" process, identify any anomalies present, and determine which model is more normative.

### Expected Standard Hire-to-Retire Process

The typical sequence for the Hire-to-Retire process might be as follows:

1. **Post Job Advertisement** (Job posting)
2. **Screen Candidates** (Review resumes/candidate responses)
3. **Conduct Interviews** (Interview rounds with candidates)
4. **Make Hiring Decision** (Hiring or not hiring decision)
5. **Onboard New Employee** (Orientation and integration into the company)
6. **Add to Payroll System** (Official payroll setup)
7. **Close Case** (Finalizing and closing out the process)

### Analysis of POWL Model 1

**Model 1 Structure:**

- The model follows a linear sequence:
  - `Post -> Screen -> Decide -> Interview -> Onboard -> Payroll -> Close`

**Anomalies Identified:**

- **Interview Before Decision:** In this model, the "Conduct Interviews" activity occurs before "Make Hiring Decision," which is anomalous because interviews typically occur after all candidates have been screened and decisions are made.
  
**Impact on Process Integrity:**
This sequence could lead to incomplete hiring processes or incorrect decision-making due to premature feedback during interviews. Such anomalies can disrupt workflow correctness, as the activities do not logically precede each other.

### Analysis of POWL Model 2

**Model 2 Structure:**

- The model introduces a loop for onboarding and an exclusive choice before payroll:
  - `Post -> Screen -> Conduct Interviews -> Make Hiring Decision -> (Loop to Onboard or Skip) -> (Choice between Payroll or Skip) -> Close`

**Anomalies Identified:**

1. **Interview Before Decision:** Similar to Model 1, interviews still occur before the decision-making stage.
   
2. **Payroll Skipping Option:** The "Add_to_Payroll" transition is associated with an XOR choice where one path skips payroll entirely, allowing for other activities (possibly additional onboarding steps or extensions).

**Impact on Process Integrity:**

- **Interview Before Decision:** Again, this disrupts the logical sequence of making decisions before proceeding to more advanced hiring stages.
  
- **Payroll Skipping Option:** This introduces a loop that could allow processes like extended interviews, further assessments, or other actions to be taken instead of immediate payroll setup. While not inherently incorrect, it suggests potential for variability in the process that may lead to inefficiencies or inconsistencies.

### Comparison and Normative Choice

**Comparing Both Models:**

- **Model 1:** The linear sequence is closer to a normative process as it respects the typical order of activities (screening before hiring decision; onboarding after). However, its failure to allow for loops or additional checks means that processes could become rigid.
  
- **Model 2:** Introduces flexibility with loops and choices but at the expense of sequence integrity. The skipping of payroll introduces variability in how quickly employees are integrated into the system.

**Normative Choice:**

Based on these analyses, **POWL Model 1** more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process due to its adherence to a logical and sequential order of activities. While it does not account for loops or additional decision points (like skipping payroll), maintaining strict sequencing is generally essential in ensuring that hiring processes are completed correctly.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, **POWL Model 1** better aligns with the normative expectations of the Hire-to-Retire process due to its adherence to a standard sequence and lack of anomalies regarding critical decision points. While flexibility offered by loops or choices could enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios, it introduces risks that can compromise the integrity and correctness of the hiring process.
