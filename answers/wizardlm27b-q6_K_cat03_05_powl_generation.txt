 Certainly! Below is an example of how you might implement a Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) model for a simple Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process in Python using the `pm4py` library. In this example, we'll define the main steps of a P2P process and their dependencies using `StrictPartialOrder`, `Transition`, and `OperatorPOWL`.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import (
    StrictPartialOrder,
    Transition,
    SilentTransition,
    OperatorPOWL,
)
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the transitions for each activity in the P2P process
create_purchase_order = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
send_purchase_order = Transition(label="Send Purchase Order")
receive_po = Transition(label="Receive Purchase Order")
approve_po = Transition(label="Approve Purchase Order")
create_invoice = Transition(label="Create Invoice")
send_invoice = Transition(label="Send Invoice")
receive_invoice = Transition(label="Receive Invoice")
confirm_receipt = Transition(label="Confirm Invoice Receipt")
make_payment = Transition(label="Make Payment")
record_payment = Transition(label="Record Payment")

# Define the loop for handling multiple invoices
invoice_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[send_invoice, receive_invoice, confirm_receipt, make_payment, record_paymen])

# Define the exclusive choice for either approving or rejecting the purchase order
po_approval = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[approve_po, create_invoice, send_invoice, receive_invoice, confirm_receipt, make_payment, record_payment])

# Define the main process as a strict partial order of all activities
p2p_process = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        create_purchase_order,
        send_purchase_order,
        receive_po,
        po_approval,  # This is an exclusive choice
        invoice_loop,  # This is a loop
        make_payment,  # This can happen after the loop finishes or if the PO is rejected
        record_payment,  # This is the final step and should happen after making payment
    ],
)

# Set the dependencies between activities (partial order)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(create_purchase_order, send_purchase_order)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(send_purchase_order, receive_po)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(receive_po, po_approval)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(po_approval, create_invoice)  # Only if PO is approved
p2p_process.order.add_edge(po_approval, invoice_loop)  # Only if PO is created (XOR operator)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(invoice_loop, make_payment)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(make_payment, record_payment)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(po_approval, make_payment)  # Only if PO is rejected and an invoice received

# Now we have the POWL model for the Purchase-to-Pay process
print(f"POWL Model for P2P Process:\n{p2p_process}")
```

In this code, we've created a POWL model that represents a P2P process with a loop for handling multiple invoices and an exclusive choice for either approving or rejecting the purchase order. The `StrictPartialOrder` object `p2p_process` encapsulates the entire workflow, while its `order` attribute is used to define the partial order between the activities.

Please note that the actual implementation of POWL in `pm4py` might have evolved since my knowledge cutoff date, so you should check the latest documentation or source code for any updates or changes in the API.
