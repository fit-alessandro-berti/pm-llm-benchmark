 Here is an example of a Log Skeleton model for a simplified Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process in Python dictionary format, based on the constraints mentioned:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    "equivalence": {"Request Purchase Order", "Verify PO"},
    "always_before": {
        ("Create Invoice", "Process Payment"),
        ("Approve PO", "Receive Goods"),
        ("Receive Goods", "Invoice Matching"),
    },
    "always_after": {
        ("Request Purchase Order", "Create Purchase Order"),
        ("Create Purchase Order", "Send for Approval"),
        ("Approve PO", "Place Order with Supplier"),
        ("Receive Goods", "Update Inventory"),
        ("Invoice Matching", "Verify Invoice"),
        ("Verify Invoice", "Record Payment"),
    },
    "never_together": set(),
    "directly_follows": {("Send for Approval", "Approve PO")},
    "activ_freq": {
        "Request Purchase Order": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Create Purchase Order": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Send for Approval": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Approve PO": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Place Order with Supplier": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Receive Goods": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Update Inventory": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Invoice Matching": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Verify PO": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Create Invoice": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Process Payment": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Verify Invoice": {1, sys.maxsize},
        "Record Payment": {1, sys.maxsize},
    },
}
```

In this example, the P2P process is represented with activities such as Request Purchase Order, Create Purchase Order, Send for Approval, Approve PO, Place Order with Supplier, Receive Goods, Update Inventory, Invoice Matching, Verify PO, Create Invoice, Process Payment, Verify Invoice, and Record Payment. The Log Skeleton model demonstrates the order in which activities should occur and their potential number of occurrences in a case.
