 I will provide an example of a Log Skeleton model for a simplified Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process in Python dictionary format based on the given constraints. This example assumes that there are four activities: `Request_Purchase`, `Approve_Purchase`, `Create_PurchaseOrder`, and `Make_Payment`.

```python
Log_Skeleton = {
    "equivalence": {"Request_Purchase": "Create_PurchaseOrder"},
    "always_before": {
        ("Request_Purchase", "Approve_Purchase"),
        ("Approve_Purchase", "Create_PurchaseOrder"),
    },
    "always_after": {("Create_PurchaseOrder", "Make_Payment")},
    "never_together": set(),
    "directly_follows": {"Approve_Purchase": "Create_PurchaseOrder"},
    "activ_freq": {
        "Request_Purchase": {1, 2},  # Assume a purchase request can be made multiple times but at least once
        "Approve_Purchase": {1},     # A purchase approval is done only once per purchase request
        "Create_PurchaseOrder": {1}, # A purchase order is created for each approved purchase request
        "Make_Payment": {1},          # A payment is made only once per purchase order
    }
}
```

In this example:
- A `Request_Purchase` must always come before an `Approve_Purchase` and a `Create_PurchaseOrder`, and a `Create_PurchaseOrder` must always follow an `Approve_Purchase`. The two activities `Approve_Purchase` and `Create_PurchaseOrder` are equivalent in terms of their occurrence (i.e., if one happens, the other should also happen).
- A `Make_Payment` can only be performed once per `Create_PurchaseOrder`.
- There are no restrictions on when a `Request_Purchase` or a `Make_Payment` occurs; hence they do not have any 'always_before' or 'directly_follows' relationships with other activities.
