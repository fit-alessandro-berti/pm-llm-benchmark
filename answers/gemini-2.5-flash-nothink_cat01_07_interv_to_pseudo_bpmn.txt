Here's a BPMN-like textual process model generated from the provided interview excerpts:

---

**Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

**Pool:** Accounts Payable Process

**Lanes:**
*   Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
*   Purchasing Officer (Dan)
*   Department Manager (Carlos)
*   Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
*   Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
*   Supplier
*   System

---

**Start Event:** Invoice Received (by email)

**Sequence Flow:**

1.  **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk):** Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number
    *   **Input:** Received Invoice
    *   **Output:** Invoice (with/without PO)

2.  **Exclusive Gateway (Decision):** PO Present?
    *   **Condition 1 (Yes):** PO Present
        *   **Path:** Go to Step 3.
    *   **Condition 2 (No):** No PO Present
        *   **Path:** Go to Step 10.

3.  **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk):** Log Invoice into Accounting System
    *   **Input:** Invoice with Valid PO
    *   **Output:** Logged Invoice (in System)

4.  **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk):** Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation
    *   **Input:** Logged Invoice
    *   **Output:** Invoice (sent to Purchasing)

5.  **Activity (Purchasing Officer):** Confirm Goods/Services Receipt and Review Invoice Details against PO
    *   **Input:** Invoice, PO details (from system)
    *   **Output:** Confirmation/Discrepancy identified

6.  **Exclusive Gateway (Decision):** Invoice Details Correct and Confirmed by Purchasing?
    *   **Condition 1 (Yes):** Everything Correct
        *   **Path:** Go to Step 7.
    *   **Condition 2 (No):** Discrepancy or Issue Identified (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items, extra units billed, missing PO)
        *   **Path:** Go to Step 8.

7.  **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk):** Match Invoice Line Items against PO in System
    *   **Input:** Invoice, PO, Purchasing Confirmation
    *   **Output:** Matched Invoice (in system)

8.  **Parallel Gateway (Split):** Discrepancy Resolution (Can involve multiple parties)
    *   **Path 8a:** **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk):** Email Purchasing Team to Clarify Discrepancy
        *   **Input:** Discrepancy Details
        *   **Output:** Clarification Request
    *   **Path 8b:** **Activity (Purchasing Officer):** Contact Supplier Directly for Correction
        *   **Input:** Discrepancy Details
        *   **Output:** Correction Request to Supplier
    *   **Path 8c:** **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk):** Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (if difficult to resolve)
        *   **Input:** Unresolved Discrepancy
        *   **Output:** Escalation Notification

9.  **Exclusive Gateway (Decision - for unresolved issues):** Issue Resolved? (This gateway represents the outcome of various resolution paths, often leading back to re-evaluation or alternative paths)
    *   **Condition 1 (Yes):** Issue Resolved (e.g., corrected invoice received, clarification provided)
        *   **Path:** Go back to Step 7 (**Loop:** Re-attempt Matching after resolution)
    *   **Condition 2 (No/Requires Supervisor Intervention):** Issue requires Supervisor's expertise
        *   **Path:** Go to Step 11.

10. **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk):** Send Invoice Back to Supplier Requesting More Details (e.g., missing PO number)
    *   **Input:** Invoice without PO
    *   **Output:** Returned Invoice, Request for PO/Details
    *   **Path:** (Implied external loop) Supplier provides corrected invoice. This leads back to **Start Event: Invoice Received** or **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk): Check for Valid PO Number** (implicitly, when the corrected invoice is received).

11. **Activity (Accounts Payable Supervisor):** Resolve Complex Discrepancies / Handle Invoices without PO
    *   **Input:** Escalated Invoice, Discrepancy Details, Invoices without PO
    *   **Output:** Resolution Plan, Request for Retrospective PO (if needed), or Rejection Decision.
    *   **Collaborates with:** Department Heads (for retrospective POs), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen), Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan).
    *   **Path:** If resolved, go back to **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk): Match Invoice Line Items against PO in System** (Step 7). If rejected, the process ends for that invoice.

12. **Activity (System/Accounts Payable Clerk):** Send Manager Approval Request
    *   **Input:** Matched & Confirmed Invoice
    *   **Output:** Approval Notification to Manager

13. **Activity (Department Manager):** Review and Approve Invoice
    *   **Input:** Invoice Details, PO, Purchasing Confirmation (via System notification)
    *   **Output:** Approval/Rejection Decision

14. **Exclusive Gateway (Decision):** Invoice Approved by Manager?
    *   **Condition 1 (Yes):** Approved
        *   **Path:** Go to Step 15.
    *   **Condition 2 (No):** Rejected or Further Investigation Required (e.g., suspicious amount, unexpected items)
        *   **Path:** Go to Step 16.

15. **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk):** Schedule Invoice for Payment
    *   **Input:** Approved Invoice
    *   **Output:** Invoice added to Payment Cycle

**End Event:** Invoice Scheduled for Payment

**Alternative/Exception Flow for Rejected by Manager:**

16. **Activity (Accounts Payable Clerk):** Hold Invoice and Investigate Further (Based on Manager's feedback)
    *   **Input:** Rejected Invoice, Manager's Comments
    *   **Output:** Investigation Plan
    *   **Path:** This likely leads back to previous resolution steps, potentially involving **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)** or **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**, or even the **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** depending on the reason for rejection. This could be modeled as a loop back to a "Resolution" gateway, similar to Step 9, and then eventually back to Step 7 or 11.

**Data Objects / Artifacts Mentioned:**
*   Invoice
*   Purchase Order (PO)
*   Accounting System (System)
*   Email
*   Confirmation Email/Notification
*   Contract (used by Karen)

---

**Key Ambiguities / Notes from Interviews:**

*   **Supplier Interaction after no PO:** Mary states she sends it back to the supplier. Dan and Karen also mention supplier contact for missing POs. The model assumes a re-submission or re-initiation of the process once the supplier provides the PO.
*   **Discrepancy Resolution:** This is a complex area. Different roles (Mary, Dan, Rita, Karen) are involved depending on the nature and severity of the discrepancy. The model shows parallel paths for initial clarification, but acknowledges escalation to Rita for harder cases. The loop back to "Match Invoice" (Step 7) covers various resolutions.
*   **Manager Rejection:** Carlos mentions rejecting or asking Mary to hold and investigate. This path (Step 16) is a simplified representation of a potential rework loop, which could involve multiple previous steps.
*   **System Notifications:** Implied throughout for transitions (e.g., manager approval request).
