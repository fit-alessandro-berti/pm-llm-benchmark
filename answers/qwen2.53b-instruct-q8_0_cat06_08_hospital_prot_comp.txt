To analyze the main differences in the given patient flow data, we need to look at several key metrics: the starting point (register location), the type of examination and diagnosis performed, the final outcome (successful discharge vs. unsuccessful treatment), and their corresponding performance values.

### Key Differences:

1. **Starting Point:**
   - The majority of cases begin with a **Registration at FD** (Family Doctor/Primary Care). This suggests that this is where most patients enter the system.
   - There are also several cases starting with a Registration at ER (Emergency Room), which might indicate situations where immediate medical attention is required.

2. **Examination and Diagnosis:**
   - The examination types vary between "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination." However, both result in either successful or unsuccessful treatment.
   - More thorough examinations ("Thorough Examination") seem to lead more frequently towards a treatment that is not immediately successful before leading to a positive outcome. This could be interpreted as needing additional time for diagnostics or intervention.

3. **Treatment Outcomes:**
   - The most common ending states are either "Treatment successful -> Discharge" followed by the least frequent state of "Discharge."
   - Cases with unsuccessful treatments often loop back through various examinations and diagnoses before achieving success.
   
4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Performance values (e.g., 260,000+ or 639,000+) indicate that on average, the process is relatively smooth from a financial standpoint but may have significant variability depending on the starting point and examination types.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Primary Care vs. Emergency:**
  - Primary care (Registration at FD) appears more frequent, suggesting it might be a first-line approach to patient management.
  
- **Examination Types:**
  - Thorough examinations seem crucial in achieving successful treatment outcomes, often serving as necessary steps before finalizing diagnoses.

- **Looping Through Multiple Treatments:**
  - Many cases show looping behavior, where patients experience multiple unsuccessful treatments before reaching a successful one. This might highlight inefficiencies or recurring issues that require more careful follow-up.
  
- **Performance Analysis:**
  - The performance numbers vary significantly across different starting points and examination types, indicating variability in system efficiency depending on how patients enter the system.

### Key Differences:
- **Starting Point:** Primary care (FD) is predominantly where patients begin, while some start with emergency rooms.
- **Examination Types:** Thorough examinations play a significant role in leading towards successful treatment but also involve loops and unsuccessful attempts before success.
- **Outcome Variability:** A high number of failed treatments indicate areas that need more focus or improvement to reduce the loopback and increase efficiency.

These insights help identify key pathways within the healthcare system and highlight potential areas for intervention or optimization.
