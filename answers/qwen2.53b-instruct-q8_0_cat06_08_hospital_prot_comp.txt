To identify the main differences between the treatment processes for the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to compare their structure, frequency of occurrences, performance metrics (e.g., time taken), and overall efficiency. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Process Structure Differences:
1. **Expert Examination vs. Thorough Examination**:
   - The 'protected' group often uses an "Expert Examination" or "Thorough Examination," while the 'unprotected' group frequently uses "Expert Examination."
   - This could indicate that more thorough or specialized diagnostic processes are used in the protected group, which might result in better treatment outcomes.

2. **Frequency of Specific Process Steps**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of certain steps such as Expert Examination and Thorough Examination (e.g., 179, 174 for "Expert Examination" and 130, 88, etc. for "Thorough Examination").
   - The unprotected group also uses these steps but at much lower frequencies, suggesting that while they do use similar diagnostic methods, the protected group employs them more extensively.

### Performance Differences:
1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - The 'protected' group shows better performance in terms of both frequency and completion rate.
   - For example, a successful discharge ("Treatment successful -> Discharge") is more frequent and often has higher performance metrics compared to the unprotected group.

2. **Time Taken**:
   - Longer time taken for "Discharge" or subsequent steps might be an indicator that additional time is spent on thorough diagnosis which might improve outcomes but also lead to longer processes.
   - This can reflect a balance between diagnostic rigor and patient care.

### Main Differences Identified:

1. **Diagnostic Rigor**:
   - The protected group exhibits more advanced diagnostics (Expert Examination, Thorough Examination) compared to the unprotected group. These steps often contribute to higher performance metrics like successful treatments and shorter discharge times.
   
2. **Execution Frequency**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of using Expert Examination and Thorough Examination across various steps in their process. This indicates more consistent application of these diagnostic methods.

3. **Process Steps Completion**:
   - The protected group completes the "Treatment successful -> Discharge" stage at a much higher rate compared to the unprotected group, suggesting better overall treatment outcomes.
   
### Conclusion
The primary differences lie in the extent and frequency with which advanced diagnostics (Expert Examination and Thorough Examination) are used. This leads to improved performance metrics such as shorter discharge times and higher success rates of treatments. The protected group's processes appear more comprehensive and meticulous, likely benefiting from these thorough diagnostic steps.
