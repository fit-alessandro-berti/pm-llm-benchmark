1. Identifying InstanceSpanning Constraints and Their Impact  
A. Formal Discovery & Quantification  
  • Cross–Case Performance Analysis: Extract from the event log, for each order and activity, the idle intervals between:  
     – Completion of the predecessor activity and start of the successor activity within the same case (withininstance wait)  
     – Start time of an activity when the required resource was already busy or when held for batch formation (betweeninstance wait).  
  • Resource Contention Mining (e.g., Celonis “Queue Mining”):  
     – ColdPacking stations: compute, for each coldpacking start event, the queue length and waiting time since the picker-complete timestamp.  
     – HazardousMaterial pack/QC: track sliding windows of active HM cases, flag times when the count is at or near the limit (10).  
  • Batch Delay Analysis: group ShippingLabelGen events by batch ID and region: measure the lag between an order’s QCcomplete and its actual labelgen timestamp.  
  • Priority Interruption Detection: identify standard orders whose packing START was delayed or paused after an express case preempted the station—measure cumulative interruption durations.  

B. Metrics  
  • ColdPacking Contention: average and 95thpercentile waiting time; station utilization; number of cold orders queued.  
  • Batch Formation Delay: mean batchwait time per region; percentage of orders delayed > T minutes awaiting batch.  
  • Priority Impact on Standard Orders: count and average delay per standard case caused by express preemptions; number of preemptions/day.  
  • Hazardous Material Throttling: fraction of HM orders that begin packing within T minutes; periods when HM count hits 10 and new HM orders are queued.  
  • Throughput & Lead Time: compare orders affected vs. unaffected by each constraint to quantify endtoend leadtime inflation.  

C. Differentiating Within vs BetweenInstance Wait  
  • WithinInstance: intervals where no resource is required (e.g., quality check internally prolonged) show up as continuous activity duration (start–complete).  
  • BetweenInstance: idle gaps between activities that correlate with resource availability signals—e.g., a coldpacking START delayed beyond expected pickingpacking transfer time. Use causal correlation (Pearson/Granger) between queue lengths and wait durations to validate betweencase blocking.  

2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions  
  • Express + ColdPacking: high express volumes for perishables will spike the coldpacking queue, increasing contention for both express and standard cold orders.  
  • Batching + Hazardous Limits: if a region’s batch window opens when 10 HM orders are midpacking/QC, new HM orders destined for that region must wait, delaying the entire batch.  
  • Express Preemptions + Hazardous Throttling: an express HM order preemption might push a standard HM order out of the processing window, compounding regulatory queuing.  

Why It Matters  
  Without understanding these crossconstraint synergies, optimizing one dimension (e.g., adding an extra batch window) may inadvertently worsen another (e.g., breach HM concurrency limits or exacerbate coldpacking delays for nonexpress).  

3. ConstraintAware Optimization Strategies  

Strategy A: Dynamic ColdPacking Resource Allocation  
  • Constraints Addressed: Shared coldpacking contention; express preemptions.  
  • Change:  
     – Implement a dynamic slotreservation policy: allocate, per hour, X% of coldpacking capacity to express orders, Y% to standard, adjusting hourly based on realtime demand forecasts from processmined arrival patterns.  
     – If express queue exceeds threshold, spin up an “overflow” packing lane (convert any idle standard station with portable chilling units).  
  • Data Leveraged:  
     – Historic coldpacking arrival distributions by order type/hour.  
     – Realtime queue measurements.  
  • Expected Outcomes:  
     – Reduced average and tail waiting times for both express and standard cold orders.  
     – Fewer priority preemptions (because express queue is proactively reserved slots).  

Strategy B: Adaptive Regional Batch Triggers  
  • Constraints Addressed: Shipping batch wait; interactions with HM limits.  
  • Change:  
     – Replace fixed-time batch windows with a hybrid rule: batch triggers when either (a) N orders accumulated for region or (b) Max wait time W reached.  
     – Incorporate HMaware batching: if HM orders currently in process 8, delay triggering HMheavy batches until concurrency drops.  
  • Data Leveraged:  
     – Processmined batch sizes, interarrival times, and HMorder concurrency profiles.  
  • Expected Outcomes:  
     – Reduced average batchformation delay; more predictable region dispatch intervals.  
     – Avoid batch initiation that would violate HM limits or force excessive downstream waiting.  

Strategy C: Scheduled TimeSlotting for Hazardous Orders  
  • Constraints Addressed: Regulatory HM limit; crosscase queuing at pack/QC.  
  • Change:  
     – Implement timeslot booking for HM orders at the “Order Received” step: assign each HM case to one of 4 predetermined packing/QC slots per hour, based on downstream capacity.  
     – If a slot is full (10 concurrent), defer booking to next slot. Provide feedback to upstream to pace order release or use express lanes for urgent HM.  
  • Data Leveraged:  
     – Historical HM processing durations; capacity utilization patterns.  
  • Expected Outcomes:  
     – Compliance guaranteed (no more than 10 HM in flight).  
     – Smoother HM flow, eliminating sudden spikes that block standard orders.  

4. Simulation and Validation  
  • Build a DiscreteEvent Simulation model incorporating:  
     – Mined activity duration distributions per order type.  
     – Resource pools: standard & coldpacking stations with reallocation logic from Strategy A.  
     – Priority queuing rules and preemption policies.  
     – Batch formation logic (Strategy B) and HM slot booking (Strategy C).  
     – Regulatory cap on HM simultaneous activities.  
  • Focus Points:  
     – Queue length dynamics at coldpacking under peak vs. offpeak.  
     – Batch wait times by region and impact on endtoend lead time.  
     – Frequency of HM cap events and resulting queueing.  
     – Throughput, resource utilization, express vs standard leadtime percentiles.  
  • Validation:  
     – Calibrate model against historical KPIs.  
     – Run scenarios with incremental strategy adoption to measure marginal improvements.  

5. Monitoring PostImplementation  
  • Key Metrics & Dashboards:  
     – Realtime queue lengths and waiting times per resource pool (cold vs standard).  
     – Batch formation latency by region: moving average and 95th percentile.  
     – HM concurrency gauge: live count vs cap; slot utilization.  
     – Express preemption events: count and average disruption per day.  
     – Endtoend lead times, drilled down by order type, per constraint-flag.  
  • Alerts & Thresholds:  
     – Coldpacking queue > X orders triggers dynamic capacity reallocation.  
     – Batch wait > W minutes raises dashboard alert for manual review.  
     – HM concurrency near cap for >10 minutes triggers upstream pacing or slot adjustment.  
  • Continuous Improvement Loop:  
     – Weekly processmining analyses to detect new bottlenecks or shifts in arrival patterns.  
     – Refine forecast models and threshold parameters for dynamic policies.  

By systematically mining crosscase effects, simulating with authentic constraints, and deploying targeted, datadriven policies, the fulfillment center can reduce interorder dependencies, shorten waiting times, and ultimately meet delivery targets even under complex instancespanning constraints.
