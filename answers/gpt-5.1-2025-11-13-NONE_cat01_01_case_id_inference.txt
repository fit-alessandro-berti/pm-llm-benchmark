Here’s a plausible reconstruction of the separate cases (patient journeys), inferred from age, gender, department, and clinical logic.

### Case 1 – ER patient, 45-year-old male (hairline fracture)

Events belonging together:

1. `08:05:13` – Register patient  
   - department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M  

4. `08:10:50` – Initial triage  
   - department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M  

7. `08:15:42` – X-ray imaging  
   - department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, body_part=left_leg  

12. `08:23:10` – Doctor consultation  
   - department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, diagnosis=hairline_fracture  

15. `08:30:05` – Patient discharged  
   - department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, followup=outpatient_clinic  

**Reasoning:** Consistent ER flow for a 45-year-old male: registration  triage  imaging  doctor consult  discharge. Age, gender, and clinical steps match.

### Case 2 – ER patient, 62-year-old female (minor infection)

Events belonging together:

2. `08:07:02` – Register patient  
   - department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F  

5. `08:12:29` – Initial triage  
   - department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F  

8. `08:16:10` – Lab test requested  
   - department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F  

10. `08:20:27` – Lab test completed  
   - department: Laboratory, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F  

11. `08:22:54` – Doctor consultation  
   - department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, diagnosis=minor_infection  

14. `08:27:00` – Prescription created  
   - department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, medication=antibiotics  

17. `08:35:29` – Patient discharged  
   - department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, followup=pharmacy_pickup  

**Reasoning:** Classic ER path for infection: registration  triage  lab request & completion  doctor consult  prescription  discharge. Age/gender match across all events.

### Case 3 – Surgery patient, 28-year-old male (scheduled knee surgery)

Events belonging together:

3. `08:07:15` – Register patient  
   - department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M  

6. `08:13:00` – Doctor consultation  
   - department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery  

9. `08:16:45` – Surgery preparation  
   - department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M  

13. `08:25:19` – Surgery performed  
   - department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, procedure=arthroscopy  

16. `08:31:37` – Recovery room  
   - department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, condition=stable  

18. `08:40:13` – Patient discharged  
   - department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, followup=physiotherapy_sessions  

**Reasoning:** Coherent elective-surgery pathway in Surgery department: registration  consult  pre-op prep  surgery  recovery  discharge, always the same 28-year-old male.
