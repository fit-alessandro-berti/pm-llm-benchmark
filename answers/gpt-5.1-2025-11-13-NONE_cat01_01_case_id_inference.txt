Here is a plausible reconstruction of the separate patient cases, inferred from age, gender, department, activity type, and temporal/logical order.

### Case 1 – ER patient, 45-year-old male (M)

Events for the 45-year-old male consistently relate to an ER visit for a leg injury that required X-ray and then discharge.

**Case 1 events:**
1. `08:05:13` – Register patient (ER, 45 M, insurance=private)  
4. `08:10:50` – Initial triage (ER, 45 M, triage_code=3)  
7. `08:15:42` – X-ray imaging (Radiology, 45 M, body_part=left_leg)  
12. `08:23:10` – Doctor consultation (ER, 45 M, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)  
15. `08:30:05` – Patient discharged (ER, 45 M, followup=outpatient_clinic)

These follow a typical ER flow: registration  triage  diagnostic imaging  doctor consult  discharge.

### Case 2 – ER patient, 62-year-old female (F)

Events for the 62-year-old female form an ER episode involving lab tests and treatment for a minor infection.

**Case 2 events:**
2. `08:07:02` – Register patient (ER, 62 F, insurance=public)  
5. `08:12:29` – Initial triage (ER, 62 F, triage_code=2)  
8. `08:16:10` – Lab test requested (ER, 62 F, test_type=blood_panel)  
10. `08:20:27` – Lab test completed (Laboratory, 62 F, results=normal_levels)  
11. `08:22:54` – Doctor consultation (ER, 62 F, diagnosis=minor_infection)  
14. `08:27:00` – Prescription created (ER, 62 F, medication=antibiotics)  
17. `08:35:29` – Patient discharged (ER, 62 F, followup=pharmacy_pickup)

This is a coherent ER case: registration  triage  lab request  lab completion  consultation  prescription  discharge.

### Case 3 – Surgery patient, 28-year-old male (M)

Events for the 28-year-old male are in Surgery and clearly describe an elective knee surgery workflow.

**Case 3 events:**
3. `08:07:15` – Register patient (Surgery, 28 M, insurance=private)  
6. `08:13:00` – Doctor consultation (Surgery, 28 M, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)  
9. `08:16:45` – Surgery preparation (Surgery, 28 M, prep_type=general_anesthesia)  
13. `08:25:19` – Surgery performed (Surgery, 28 M, procedure=arthroscopy)  
16. `08:31:37` – Recovery room (Surgery, 28 M, condition=stable)  
18. `08:40:13` – Patient discharged (Surgery, 28 M, followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

This follows a typical surgical pathway: registration for surgery  pre-op consult  preparation  surgery  recovery  discharge.
