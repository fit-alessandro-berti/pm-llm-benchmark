1. Which process variant has the best performance in terms of time taken for completion? Confidence score: 10/10
2. What is the most common process variant? Confidence score: 10/10
3. Why does the variant that goes through pre-approval (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled) not appear more frequently? Confidence score: 8/10
4. Is there a correlation between the number of rejections and the overall performance of a process variant? Confidence score: 9/10
5. What causes the large difference in performance for the process variant with rejections (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled) compared to other variants with fewer rejections? Confidence score: 7/10
6. Why are some variants rejected by the supervisor or the budget owner, while others are not? Confidence score: 6/10
7. Can the process be optimized to avoid the loop of rejections by administration and employee? Confidence score: 7/10
8. How can the process variant with the highest performance (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled) be encouraged to happen more often? Confidence score: 6/10
9. What is the reason for the declaration being saved by the employee (Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE) instead of being submitted directly? Confidence score: 5/10
10. Why is the process variant with the highest frequency (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled) not the one with the best performance? Confidence score: 8/10
11. What is the reason for the declaration being rejected by missing (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING)? Confidence score: 4/10
12. How can the process be optimized to reduce the number of times an employee has to resubmit a declaration? Confidence score: 8/10
