Proposed High-Level Manufacturing Steps
-----------------------------------------

| High-Level Step | Low-Level Events That Belong Here (Activity  Resource)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Short Rationale (how the events are linked)                                                                 |

| 1. Material Preparation | Retrieve raw metal sheet  Operator A<br>Scan barcode  Operator A<br>Place metal sheet on table  Operator A<br>Align metal sheet  Robot Arm #2<br>Preheat metal sheet  Heating Unit #1 | All actions turn “raw stock” into a correctly positioned, pre-heated work-piece; they are done on every metal sheet before any precision work. |
| 2. Welding Assembly | Pick up welding tool  Operator B<br>Weld corner A  Operator B<br>Weld corner B  Operator B | One operator, one tool, consecutive welds — a coherent sub-process that joins the work-piece. |
| 3. Weld Quality Check | Measure weld integrity  Quality Sensor #1 | Dedicated sensor check immediately after welding; pass/fail data is captured before downstream coating. |
| 4. Protective Coating Application | Apply protective coating  Coating Unit #3<br>Dry coating  Heating Unit #2 | Dual-stage finishing in one area: coat + oven cure. Event codes are distinct yet contiguous for every case. |
| 5. Final Visual Inspection | Visual check  Operator C | Human operator always does the last check, approving the finished unit before release. |

How the Grouping Was Done
-------------------------

1. **Fixed, strictly ordered sequence:** Across both sample cases, the exact same 12 activities occur in the same order with only minor timing differences. This repeatability indicates a controlled, step-wise process.

2. **Functional roles & locations:**  
   - Events tied to supplying the work-station (retrieval, scanning, loading) are preparatory (“prep”).  
   - Events involving tool pickup and welds fall under a fabrication step (“assembly/welding”).  
   - Each fabrication step is followed by its corresponding quality check.  
   - Coating-related events form a self-contained finishing step.  
   - The operator’s last visual scan always ends the flow.

3. **Temporal proximity and shared resources:** Activities within each proposed high-level step are executed in immediate sequence by one dedicated resource type (operator, robot, sensor, oven).

Rules for Future Autonomous Aggregation
---------------------------------------

For an automated parser / process-mining engine, encode the high-level blocks as:

```json
[
  {
    "HighLevelStep": "Material Preparation",
    "Trigger": "Retrieve raw metal sheet",
    "Terminus": "Preheat metal sheet"
  },
  {
    "HighLevelStep": "Welding Assembly",
    "Trigger": "Pick up welding tool",
    "Terminus": "Weld corner B"
  },
  {
    "HighLevelStep": "Weld Quality Check",
    "Trigger": "Measure weld integrity",
    "Terminus": "Measure weld integrity"
  },
  {
    "HighLevelStep": "Protective Coating Application",
    "Trigger": "Apply protective coating",
    "Terminus": "Dry coating"
  },
  {
    "HighLevelStep": "Final Visual Inspection",
    "Trigger": "Visual check",
    "Terminus": "Visual check"
  }
]
```

Any incoming log stream that matches the above sequences can be rolled-up to the corresponding high-level step, producing concise, interpretable process maps.
