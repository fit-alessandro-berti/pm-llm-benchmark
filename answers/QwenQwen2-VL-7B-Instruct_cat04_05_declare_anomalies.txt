    * ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')
  * The constraint "Non Co-Existence" is violated in the following cases:
    * ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION')
    * ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR')
    * ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER')
  * The constraint "Non Succession" is violated in the following cases:
    * ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION')
    * ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR')
    * ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER')
