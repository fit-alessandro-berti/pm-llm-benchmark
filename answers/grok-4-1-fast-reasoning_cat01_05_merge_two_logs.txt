### Merged Event Log

The merged log uses **Log A timestamps as the primary timestamp** for matched events (since Log A is the primary timeline). For unmatched events, the original timestamp is used. Events are sorted chronologically by primary timestamp. Event names are **standardized** to Log A's naming convention where possible for consistency, with variants noted. All attributes from both logs are included (Log B's richer fields prefixed where merged). Missing fields are marked as `N/A`.

Format: `primary_timestamp, event_type, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes, alt_timestamp (B if different), origin`

### Reasoning for Merging Decisions

1. **Order Received (A: 10:00:00Z)  OrderReceived (B: 09:59:58Z)**:  
   - Timestamp diff: 2 seconds (within 2s tolerance).  
   - Names semantically identical (minor camelCase difference).  
   - Merged: Used A's timestamp and name as primary; added B's `user_id=u45`, `resource_id=r10`, `notes`.

2. **Order Validated (A: 10:01:30Z)  OrderValidation (B: 10:01:29Z)**:  
   - Timestamp diff: 1 second (well within tolerance).  
   - Names match exactly in meaning.  
   - Merged: Used A's timestamp and name; added B's `user_id=u12`, `resource_id=r10`, `notes`.

3. **Payment Processed (A: 10:02:00Z)  PaymentCheck (B: 10:02:05Z)**:  
   - Timestamp diff: 5 seconds (slightly over 2s but acceptable given "few seconds" context and no other matches).  
   - Names semantically equivalent (both describe payment handling; B notes "Payment gateway delay" aligns).  
   - No closer matches available. Merged: Used A's timestamp and name; added B's attributes.  
   - Alternative: Could treat as separate, but confidence high due to sequence position and order_id match.

4. **Quality Check (B: 10:03:00Z)**:  
   - No corresponding event in A (no similar name or timestamp near 10:03).  
   - Included as-is from B (fits between Payment and Shipping in sequence).

5. **Item Shipped (A: 10:05:00Z)  Shipping (B: 10:05:02Z)**:  
   - Timestamp diff: 2 seconds (within tolerance).  
   - Names synonymous (shipping/shipment).  
   - Merged: Used A's timestamp and name; added B's attributes.

6. **Item Delivered (A: 10:20:00Z)**:  
   - No match in B (B ends at 10:05; no delivery event).  
   - Included as-is from A.

**General Resolutions**:  
- **Timestamp Selection**: Log A as primary for merges (per "primary timeline"); B's timestamp included as `alt_timestamp` for transparency. Tolerance applied flexibly (up to 5s) based on log descriptions of offsets.  
- **No Conflicting Events**: All matches were 1:1; no duplicates or major overlaps.  
- **Chronology**: Sorted by primary timestamp; results in logical order.  
- **Attributes**: Fully enriched (B's fields added to A's base). No data conflicts (e.g., different user_ids handled by inclusion).  
- **Uncertainties**: Payment match has highest uncertainty (5s diff, name variance), but sequence logic supports it. If stricter 2s rule applied, it would be separate—but context allows leniency. Total events: 6 (4 merged + 2 unique).
