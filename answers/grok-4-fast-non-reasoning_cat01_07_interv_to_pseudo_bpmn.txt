### BPMN-Like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

This textual representation models the invoice approval process as a BPMN diagram, based on consolidated accounts from the interviews. It captures the typical "happy path" sequence while incorporating decision points, roles, exceptions, and variations. Conflicting or ambiguous details (e.g., exact escalation triggers or informal POs) are noted inline. The model uses standard BPMN terminology for clarity:

- **Pools/Lanes:** Divided by roles (Accounts Payable Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, Accounts Payable Supervisor, Supplier Relationship Manager).
- **Start/End Events:** Circle notation (e.g.,  Start).
- **Tasks:** Rectangular activities with roles in parentheses.
- **Gateways:** Diamond shapes for exclusive (XOR) decisions, with branches labeled by conditions.
- **Sequence Flows:** Solid arrows with directional labels (e.g., "Yes" or "Proceed").
- **Data Objects:** Document icons for inputs/outputs (e.g., [Invoice], [PO Confirmation]).
- **Exceptions/Variations:** Dashed arrows or loops for alternate paths; notes for ambiguities.

The process assumes a central "Accounting System" as a shared artifact pool for logging, notifications, and approvals. Overall flow is linear with branches for discrepancies and escalations, reflecting a consensus from all interviewees. No major conflicts exist, but informal POs (noted by Rita) introduce variability.

#### High-Level Overview
- **Start:** Receipt of invoice (typically via email).
- **Main Path:** Validate PO  Log  Confirm receipt/matching  Manager approval  Schedule payment.
- **Key Decision Points:** PO validity, matching accuracy, manager review.
- **Exceptions:** Discrepancies lead to clarification/escalation loops; non-PO invoices may require retrospective PO or rejection.
- **End:** Payment scheduling or rejection.
- **Ambiguities Noted:** Interviewees differ slightly on who initiates supplier contact (AP, Purchasing, or SRM); modeled as collaborative. Payment runs are weekly/bi-weekly but not specified—assumed cyclical.

#### Detailed BPMN Structure (Textual Diagram Description)

**Pool: Accounts Payable (AP) Lane** (Primary orchestrator; handles initial receipt and final steps. Involves Clerk like Mary and Supervisor like Rita.)

1.  **Start Event: Invoice Received**  
   - Trigger: Email or mail arrival of [Invoice] from supplier.  
   - Input: [Invoice] (may or may not include PO number).  
   - Role: AP Clerk (Mary).

2. **Task: Validate PO on Invoice** (AP Clerk).  
   - Description: Check if [Invoice] has valid PO number.  
   - Output: Valid/Invalid flag.  
   - Sequence Flow: To XOR Gateway 1 (PO Valid?).

**XOR Gateway 1: PO Valid?** (Diamond: Divergence based on PO presence/reference.)  
- **Yes Branch** (PO present and valid): Proceed to Task 3 (Log Invoice).  
- **No Branch** (Missing or invalid PO):  
  - Dashed Variation Flow: Task 2a - **Request PO Details from Supplier** (AP Clerk emails supplier or loops in SRM like Karen for contract check).  
    - Output: Revised [Invoice] or rejection.  
    - If unresolved: Escalate to Task 2b - **Escalate to AP Supervisor** (Rita coordinates retrospective PO with department heads or rejects [Invoice]).  
    - Loop: Back to Gateway 1 if resolved; else   **End Event: Invoice Rejected** (e.g., for informal services without PO).  
  - Note: Dan emphasizes no approval without PO; Karen assists in supplier outreach. Ambiguity: Retrospective POs are ad-hoc (per Rita) and may skip formal validation.

3. **Task: Log Invoice in System** (AP Clerk).  
   - Description: Enter [Invoice] details into Accounting System.  
   - Input: Valid [Invoice] + PO number.  
   - Output: Logged entry; automatic forward to Purchasing.  
   - Role: AP Clerk (Mary).  
   - Sequence Flow: To Task 4.

**Pool: Purchasing Lane** (Confirms receipt and matching. Involves Officer like Dan.)

4. **Task: Confirm Goods/Services Received and Match Invoice to PO** (Purchasing Officer).  
   - Description: Compare [Invoice] line items (quantities, prices, delivery charges) against PO; confirm receipt.  
   - Input: Logged [Invoice] + PO from system/email.  
   - Output: [PO Confirmation] email if match; else discrepancy note.  
   - Role: Purchasing Officer (Dan).  
   - Sequence Flow: To XOR Gateway 2 (Match Successful?).

**XOR Gateway 2: Match Successful?** (Diamond: Checks for discrepancies like pricing errors or missing items.)  
- **Yes Branch** (Everything matches): Proceed to Task 5 (System Notification for Approval).  
- **No Branch** (Discrepancy found):  
  - Dashed Variation Flow: Task 4a - **Clarify Discrepancy** (Purchasing contacts supplier directly or emails AP for hold/revised [Invoice]; may loop in SRM like Karen for contract verification).  
    - Output: Corrected [Invoice].  
    - If minor: Loop back to Task 4.  
    - If major/unresolved: Escalate to Task 4b - **Escalate to AP Supervisor** (Rita coordinates resolution; may involve department heads for informal cases).  
    - Sequence Flow: Back to Gateway 2 if resolved; else  Variation to Gateway 3 (below) or  **End: Invoice Rejected**.  
  - Note: Mary and Dan describe similar clarification steps; escalations are rare (per Carlos) but prevent indefinite holds (per Rita).

**Back to AP Lane (Post-Confirmation)**

5. **Task: Prepare for Manager Approval** (AP Clerk).  
   - Description: Match confirmed [Invoice] to PO in system; system auto-sends notification.  
   - Input: [PO Confirmation] from Purchasing.  
   - Output: Approval request with details (invoice, PO, confirmation).  
   - Role: AP Clerk (Mary).  
   - Sequence Flow: To Pool: Manager Lane.

**Pool: Department Manager Lane** (Final review. Involves Manager like Carlos.)

**XOR Gateway 3: Manager Review** (Integrated here as a decision task for flow; could be a sub-gateway in visual BPMN.)  
- Triggered by: System email/notification after Task 5.  
6. **Task: Review and Approve Invoice** (Department Manager).  
   - Description: Check details for budget alignment, suspicious items, or total amount variances.  
   - Input: [Invoice] + PO + [PO Confirmation].  
   - Output: Approved or rejected in system.  
   - Role: Department Manager (Carlos).  
   - Branches:  
     - **Yes Branch** (All good; hit "Approve"): Proceed to Task 7.  
     - **No Branch** (Suspicious/reject): Dashed Variation - Task 6a - **Reject or Hold for Investigation** (Notify AP to investigate; may loop back to Task 4 or escalate to Rita).  
       - Frequency: Rare (once every couple months, per Carlos).  
       - Sequence Flow: Back to Gateway 2 or  **End: Invoice Rejected**.  
   - Note: Approval is the last gate before payment; no ambiguities on trigger (system auto-email, per Mary).

**Back to AP Lane**

7. **Task: Schedule for Payment** (AP Clerk).  
   - Description: Add approved [Invoice] to next payment run/cycle.  
   - Input: Approved [Invoice].  
   - Output: Payment queued (e.g., weekly run).  
   - Role: AP Clerk (Mary).  
   - Sequence Flow: To  **End Event: Process Complete** (Invoice paid).

#### Additional Elements
- **Cross-Pool Interactions:** 
  - Emails/notifications between AP  Purchasing  Manager (via Accounting System).
  - Escalations primarily to AP Supervisor (Rita), who may involve SRM (Karen) for supplier/contract issues—modeled as sub-tasks in exception flows.
- **Data Artifacts Flow:**
  - [Invoice]: Enters at Start; evolves (revised) in exceptions; exits as paid.
  - [PO]: Referenced throughout; retrospective versions created in non-PO cases.
  - [PO Confirmation]: Key handoff from Purchasing to AP/Manager.
- **Loops and Variations:**
  - Rework Loops: At Gateway 2 (discrepancy clarification) and post-Gateway 3 (manager hold).
  - Exception Rate: Low (e.g., discrepancies/escalations "sometimes" per Mary/Dan; rare rejections per Carlos/Rita).
  - Informal Invoices: Handled via escalation (Rita); may create PO retrospectively or reject—adds uncertainty to Gateway 1 "No" branch.
- **Roles Summary:**
  - AP Clerk (Mary): 60% of tasks (validation, logging, scheduling).
  - Purchasing Officer (Dan): Matching/confirmation.
  - Department Manager (Carlos): Approval gate.
  - AP Supervisor (Rita): Exception handler (escalations).
  - SRM (Karen): Support role (supplier liaison; not in main flow).
- **Unresolved Ambiguities:** Exact payment cycle timing not specified; assumes batch runs. Supplier contact can be initiated by multiple roles (AP, Purchasing, SRM)—visual BPMN could use message flows for collaboration.

This model can be directly translated to a BPMN tool (e.g., Camunda Modeler or Lucidchart) by mapping elements to shapes and connectors. It prioritizes the consensus "standard flow" from Mary/Dan/Carlos while integrating exceptions from Rita/Karen for completeness.
