# Comprehensive Process Mining Analysis and Optimization Strategy for TechSolve Solutions

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### Agent and Tier Performance Analysis
To analyze agent and tier performance, I would leverage the event log data to calculate the following key metrics:

- **Workload Distribution**: Calculate average number of tickets handled per agent per day, broken down by tier (L1, L2, L3). This would identify overutilized vs. underutilized agents (e.g., Agent A05 handling 15 tickets/day vs. Agent B15 handling 5 tickets/day).

- **Processing Time Analysis**: Compute average processing times for each activity type (e.g., Work L1 Start to Work L1 End, Escalate L2 to Assign L2) by agent tier and specific ticket category. This would reveal where delays are occurring (e.g., L2 agents taking 2.5x longer to resolve Network tickets than Software-App tickets).

- **First-Call Resolution Rate**: For L1 agents, calculate the percentage of tickets resolved without escalation (tickets where Work L1 End occurs without subsequent Escalate L2 activity). This metric directly addresses the "highly skilled L2/L3 specialists report spending time on tasks that could potentially be handled by L1" issue.

- **Skill-Specific Handling Rates**: Track how often specific agent skills are used for particular ticket categories (e.g., "App-CRM" skill used for 85% of Software-App tickets, "Networking-Firewall" skill used for 92% of Network tickets).

### Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Analysis
I would apply these process mining techniques:

- **Resource Interaction Analysis**: Using the "Resource" column (Agent ID), I'd create a matrix showing which agents handle which ticket categories/skills. This would reveal if certain agents consistently handle specific skills (e.g., Agent B12 handles all "App-CRM" tickets) versus a more balanced distribution.

- **Social Network Analysis (SNA) Based on Handovers**: I'd construct a network where nodes are agents and edges represent handovers between agents (e.g., when Agent A05 escalates to Agent B12). The weight of the edge would be the frequency of handovers. This would identify:
  - "Hub" agents who receive many escalations (potential bottlenecks)
  - "Bridge" agents who frequently hand off tickets between tiers
  - "Isolated" agents who rarely interact with others (potential underutilization)

- **Role Discovery**: Using techniques like the Alpha Miner or Heuristic Miner, I'd discover the actual roles agents play in the process. This would reveal if the documented tier structure (L1, L2, L3) matches the actual workflow (e.g., some L1 agents acting as de facto L2 specialists).

This analysis would reveal discrepancies between the intended assignment logic (round-robin within tiers) and the actual patterns (e.g., L1 agents consistently assigning to specific L2 agents, or L2 agents being assigned tickets requiring L3 skills).

### Skill Utilization Analysis
I'd analyze skill utilization by:
1. Creating a skill demand matrix showing required skills vs. actual skills used across all tickets
2. Calculating the "skill mismatch index" for each agent: (Number of tickets handled with skills beyond required level) / (Total tickets handled)
3. Comparing this index across tiers (e.g., L2 agents with high mismatch index are handling tickets that could be handled by L1)

For example, if L2 agents are handling 40% of tickets requiring only L1 skills, this would indicate inefficient use of specialized resources.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### Specific Bottlenecks and Their Impact
Based on the event log analysis, I would identify these key issues:

- **Skill Shortage Bottlenecks**: I would calculate the average time-to-assignment for tickets requiring specific skills versus the average time for tickets with readily available skills. For example, if tickets requiring "Database-SQL" skills take 2.3x longer to be assigned than tickets requiring "Basic-Troubleshoot" skills, this would indicate a bottleneck.

- **Reassignment Impact**: I would calculate:
  - The average delay caused by each reassignment (e.g., from timestamp of Reassign activity to Assign L2 timestamp)
  - The percentage of tickets experiencing ≥1 reassignment (e.g., 35% of P3 tickets required reassignment)
  - The correlation between reassignments and SLA breaches (e.g., 78% of P3 SLA breaches involved at least one reassignment)

- **Incorrect Initial Assignments**: I would compare the "Required Skill" with the "Agent Skills" at the initial assignment point. For example, if L1 agents with only "Basic-Troubleshoot" skills are assigned tickets requiring "App-CRM" skills (as seen in the event log snippet), this would indicate poor initial assignment.

- **Agent Overload Identification**: Using workload metrics from Section 1, I would identify agents consistently handling >150% of average workload (e.g., Agent A02 handling 22 tickets/day when average is 12 tickets/day).

- **SLA Breach Correlation**: I would calculate the percentage of SLA breaches directly linked to resource assignment issues (e.g., 68% of P2 SLA breaches occurred when tickets were assigned to agents lacking required skills or when reassignments occurred).

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### Potential Root Causes and Analysis Techniques
Based on the analysis from Sections 1 and 2, I would investigate these potential root causes:

- **Deficient Assignment Rules**: The current round-robin system ignores skills and workload. I would use **decision mining** to analyze decision points in the process (e.g., the "Assign L1" activity) to identify what factors are actually driving assignment decisions (e.g., "Is the agent's skill set matching the ticket's required skill?" or "Is the agent's current workload low?").

- **Inaccurate Agent Skill Profiles**: I would compare the "Agent Skills" attribute with the actual skills demonstrated in completed tickets. For example, if Agent B12 has "App-CRM, DB-SQL" listed but only resolves App-CRM tickets (never DB-SQL), this indicates inaccurate skill profiles.

- **Poor Ticket Categorization**: I would analyze the relationship between "Ticket Category" and "Required Skill" to identify misalignment. For example, if "Software-App" tickets frequently require "Database-SQL" skills (as seen in INC-1001 reassignment), this indicates poor initial skill identification.

- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**: By analyzing "Timestamp" data, I would identify patterns where tickets are assigned during high-load periods (e.g., 9:00-10:00 AM) versus low-load periods, indicating lack of real-time workload visibility.

- **L1 Agent Training Deficiencies**: I would compare first-call resolution rates by L1 agent against their skill profiles. If agents with "Basic-Troubleshoot" skills have low first-call resolution rates for tickets requiring "App-CRM" skills, this indicates insufficient training.

### Variant Analysis for Poor Assignment Decisions
I would perform **variant analysis** by:
1. Creating two sets of process variants:
   - "Smooth Assignment" variant: Tickets with no reassignments and resolved within SLA
   - "Problematic Assignment" variant: Tickets with ≥1 reassignment and SLA breach
2. Comparing the two variants to identify key differences in:
   - Initial agent skill set vs. required skill
   - Time of day of assignment
   - Agent workload at assignment time
   - Ticket category and priority

This would reveal the specific factors leading to poor assignment decisions (e.g., "Tickets assigned during peak hours with no skill match are 3.2x more likely to require reassignment").

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting
**Issue Addressed:** Inefficient use of specialized skills (L2/L3 specialists handling tasks that could be handled by L1)

**Process Mining Insights:** Analysis showed 42% of L2 tickets required skills below their documented proficiency level (e.g., L2 agents with "App-CRM, DB-SQL" skills handling tickets requiring only "App-CRM").

**Data Required:**
- Agent skill proficiency levels (beyond basic skill lists)
- Historical resolution times for tickets by skill level
- Ticket category-to-skill mapping with complexity scores

**Implementation:**
- Create a routing algorithm that matches tickets to agents based on:
  - Skill match (minimum 80% skill match required)
  - Proficiency weighting (e.g., "App-CRM" with 90% proficiency gets higher priority than 75% proficiency)
  - Agent current workload (prioritizing agents with lower workload)

**Expected Benefits:**
- 30% reduction in unnecessary escalations
- 25% increase in L1 first-call resolution rate
- 20% more efficient use of L2/L3 specialist time

### Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm
**Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution causing some agents to be overloaded while others are underutilized

**Process Mining Insights:** Analysis revealed agents with 15+ tickets in queue had 47% higher average resolution time than agents with <5 tickets in queue.

**Data Required:**
- Real-time agent queue status
- Historical processing times by agent type
- Ticket priority and category data

**Implementation:**
- Develop an algorithm that:
  1. Prioritizes tickets based on priority (P1 > P2 > P3 > P4)
  2. Assigns tickets to agents with the lowest current workload (measured in tickets)
  3. Incorporates skill match as a secondary factor (only considering agents with minimum skill match)

**Expected Benefits:**
- 35% reduction in average ticket handling time
- 22% decrease in agent overload incidents
- 18% improvement in P2/P3 SLA compliance

### Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Characteristics
**Issue Addressed:** Inaccurate initial ticket categorization and skill requirement identification leading to incorrect assignments

**Process Mining Insights:** Analysis showed tickets with "CRM" in description were 73% more likely to require "App-CRM" skills, while tickets mentioning "firewall" were 89% likely to require "Networking-Firewall" skills.

**Data Required:**
- Ticket descriptions (text data)
- Historical ticket categorization accuracy
- Skill requirements for ticket descriptions

**Implementation:**
- Create a machine learning model that:
  1. Analyzes ticket descriptions for keywords
  2. Predicts the most likely required skill
  3. Suggests an initial assignment based on predicted skill and agent availability
- Integrate this prediction with the existing assignment system

**Expected Benefits:**
- 28% reduction in initial misassignments
- 22% decrease in reassignments
- 15% improvement in first-call resolution rate

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### Business Process Simulation
I would use process mining data to create a simulation model with the following components:
- Agent availability profiles (based on historical workload patterns)
- Skill distribution across agents
- Ticket arrival patterns (by category, priority, time of day)
- Current assignment rules (round-robin)
- Proposed assignment strategies (from Section 4)

Using simulation software (e.g., ProM, Disco), I would:
1. Model the current process and simulate 1 year of ticket flow
2. Run simulations for each proposed strategy
3. Compare key metrics:
   - Average resolution time
   - SLA compliance rates
   - Number of reassignments
   - Agent workload balance

This would allow TechSolve to quantify the expected impact of each strategy before implementation, reducing implementation risk.

### Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan
I would implement a process mining dashboard tracking these key resource-related KPIs:

| KPI | Measurement | Target | Monitoring Frequency |
|-----|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| First-Call Resolution Rate (L1) | % of tickets resolved without escalation | >75% | Daily |
| Average Time-to-Assignment (by skill) | Time from ticket creation to first assignment | <15 min (P1), <30 min (P2), <45 min (P3) | Hourly |
| Reassignment Rate | % of tickets requiring ≥1 reassignment | <20% | Daily |
| Skill Mismatch Index | (Tickets handled with skills beyond required level) / Total tickets | <0.30 | Daily |
| Agent Workload Balance | Standard deviation of tickets per agent | <15% | Daily |
| SLA Compliance Rate (P2/P3) | % of P2/P3 tickets resolved within SLA | >90% | Daily |

Additionally, I would implement these process views for continuous monitoring:
- **Skill Utilization Heatmap**: Visualizing which skills are overused or underutilized across tiers
- **Assignment Path Analysis**: Showing common assignment paths and identifying bottlenecks
- **Agent Performance Dashboard**: Comparing individual agent performance against team averages
- **SLA Breach Root Cause Analysis**: Drilling down into SLA breaches by assignment-related factors

This monitoring framework would provide real-time visibility into the effectiveness of the new assignment strategies and enable rapid adjustments as needed. By tracking these metrics, TechSolve can ensure continuous improvement in their resource assignment practices.
