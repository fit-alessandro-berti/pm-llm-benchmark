Process mining is a technique that analyzes operational data (often log files) captured at an enterprise to automatically discover information about processes, such as identifying what works well or poorly. It's been evolving over time, initially with process discovery focusing on discovering patterns in events using machine learning algorithms and then turning to conformance checking to assess whether a real-life system follows pre-defined models.

Process enhancement involves improving upon this by building upon discovered knowledge to transform it into an effective implementation of the desired operational processes or new business operations. It aims to create better, more efficient methods for achieving these goals instead of just analyzing them using the techniques mentioned previously.

Conformance Checking: This primarily focuses on verifying whether a real-life system (either in terms of its operation as-is or proposed changes) adheres to certain rules or standards defined through process mining results; hence it’s only part of the overall lifecycle. Conformance checking, once an important aspect of improving processes by identifying areas needing optimization based on previously discovered patterns.

Process Discovery: Focusing more broadly across various stages—starting from raw event data collection and transforming them into a model that can be understood visually through visualization techniques like activity networks or diagrams before moving towards discovering insights or even improvements. The scope often extends beyond merely verifying against predefined models towards creating better representations of the actual processes involved.

Therefore, enhancing process refers to both refining discovered knowledge into actionable steps but also implementing these learned methods in operational environments for continuous improvement. Through enhanced understanding and flexibility of data-driven approach to improving business processes, businesses leverage insights into what works well within current operations while envisioning ways forward through innovation.
