To identify which cases in the event log violate the normative process, we need to carefully examine each case against the described sequence and constraints. Let's analyze each case one by one:

### Case 1:
- **Activities:** Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order
- **Analysis:**
  - The sequence follows the expected flow when inventory is sufficient.
  - Activities occur in the correct order: "Receive", "Check", "Authorize Payment", "Package", "Ship", "Close".
- **Conclusion:** No violations.

### Case 2:
- **Activities:** Receive order → Check inventory → Package items → Authorize payment → Ship order → Close order
- **Analysis:**
  - Violation: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
  - According to the normative description, "Authorize payment" should happen before "Package items" because payment authorization must be confirmed before preparing items for shipment.
- **Violation Explanation:** This sequence violates the rule that payment authorization must precede packaging.

### Case 3:
- **Activities:** Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Cancel order → Ship order → Close order
- **Analysis:**
  - Violations:
    1. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which is logically incorrect as no shipping should occur if an order is canceled.
    2. "Authorize payment" happens before "Cancel order," which doesn't make sense in a cancellation scenario where payment authorization would not typically occur.
- **Violation Explanation:** Shipping after cancellation and authorizing payment before cancellation are both significant deviations from the described norms.

### Case 4:
- **Activities:** Receive order → Check inventory → Cancel order → Close order
- **Analysis:**
  - The sequence matches the expected flow for insufficient inventory scenarios.
  - Activities occur in the correct order: "Receive", "Check", "Cancel", "Close".
- **Conclusion:** No violations.

### Case 5:
- **Activities:** Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Ship order → Close order
- **Analysis:**
  - Violation: Missing "Package items" step.
  - According to the normative description, "Package items" should occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order" since items must be prepared before they can be shipped.
- **Violation Explanation:** Skipping the "Package items" step disrupts the logical sequence of preparing items before shipping them.

### Summary of Violations:
1. **Case 2:** 
   - Violation: Packaging items before authorizing payment.
   - Rule Violated: Payment authorization must precede packaging.

2. **Case 3:** 
   - Violations: Shipping after cancellation; authorizing payment before cancellation.
   - Rules Violated: Shipping should not occur post-cancellation; payment authorization is irrelevant in cancellation scenarios.

3. **Case 5:** 
   - Violation: Missing "Package items" step.
   - Rule Violated: Items must be packaged before shipping.

By adhering to these analyses, we ensure that the processes align with the intended sequence and constraints outlined in the normative description. Any deviation identified here represents a violation of the expected operational principles.
