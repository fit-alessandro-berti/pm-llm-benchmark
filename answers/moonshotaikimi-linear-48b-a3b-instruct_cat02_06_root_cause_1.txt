The **Customer Support Ticket Resolution** process consists of multiple steps, and performance issues can arise from either excessive durations within individual activities, idle time between steps, or frequent escalations. Below is an analysis of the event log to identify delays and potential root causes.

---

### **1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**

We will calculate the **total resolution time** (from ticket receipt to closure) for each case:

| Case ID | Start (Receive)       | End (Close)           | Total Duration | Exit Activity         |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00       | 2024-03-01 10:15       | 2h 15m         | Close Ticket           |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05       | 2024-03-02 09:15       | **25h 10m**    | Close Ticket           |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10       | 2024-03-01 09:30       | 1h 20m         | Close Ticket           |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20       | 2024-03-02 08:30       | **24h 10m**    | Close Ticket           |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25       | 2024-03-03 09:30       | **25h 5m**     | Close Ticket           |

**Cases 102, 104, and 105** have **significantly longer resolution times**, with durations exceeding **24 hours**.

### **2. Determine Potential Root Causes of Poor Performance**

#### **Case 102**
- **Escalation**: Escalated to Level-2 at **09:00** on Day 1.
- **Investigation**: Delayed until **14:00** on Day 2 (over 22 hours).
- **Root Cause**: Likely **idle time after escalation**, possibly due to:
  - Waiting for specialized knowledge or availability.
  - Escalated to misaligned team or department.

#### **Case 104**
- **Investigation**: Delayed until **13:00** on Day 2 (over 22 hours).
- **No Escalation**.
- **Root Cause**: Likely **slow assignment or prioritization**.
  - Delay between triage and assignment.
  - Possible backlogging in Level-1 assignments.

#### **Case 105**
- **Escalation**: Escalated to Level-2 at **10:00** on Day 1.
- **Investigation**: Delayed until **14:00** on Day 2 (even later than Case 102).
- **Root Cause**: Similar to Case 102: **escalation handling inefficiencies**, possibly:
  - Delayed assignment to Level-2.
  - Communication gaps after escalation.

### **3. Insights and Recommendations**

#### **Observed Patterns**
- **All delayed cases involved escalations** (Cases 102, 104, 105), though Case 104 did not escalate.
- **Investigation step** is the most time-consuming, especially after escalations.
- There may be a **disconnect between triage and assignment**, especially for more complex issues.

#### **Recommendations**

1. **Improve Initial Triage Efficiency**
   - Use **automated ticket classification** to route complex or escalated tickets more quickly.
   - Assign **priority flags** based on customer tier, issue type, or past resolution times.

2. **Reduce Escalation Lag**
   - Define **clear escalation criteria** and automate them where possible.
   - Set **SLAs for following up on escalated tickets** (e.g., acknowledgment within 1 hour, investigation within 4 hours).

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Ensure Level-2 teams are available **based on load forecasts** and ticket types.
   - Consider adding **escalation queue or on-call rotations** to reduce idle time after escalation.

4. **Visibility and Monitoring**
   - Implement **real-time dashboards** to monitor queue lengths, average response times, and escalations.
   - Use **predictive analytics** to identify tickets likely to escalate or experience long waits.

5. **Post-Escalation Process Optimization**
   - Standardize documentation and handoff procedures between Level-1 and Level-2.
   - Provide **checklists or templates** for Level-2 agents to reduce time spent understanding the issue.

---

### **Summary**

Cases 102, 104, and 105 experienced long resolution times, primarily due to:
- Delays in investigating issues after escalation.
- Idle time post-triage, especially for complex cases.
- Lack of real-time visibility and resource planning.

Addressing these via improved triage, faster escalation handling, optimized resource allocation, and better monitoring will significantly reduce cycle times and improve customer satisfaction.
