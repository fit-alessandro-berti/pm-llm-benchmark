**Defining process constraints dictionary**

I’m putting together a Python dictionary capturing logical constraints for a sequence of activities in an ordering process, including equivalences, ordering rules (always before/after), never-together pairs, activity frequency limits, and some direct-follow requirements to represent the process flow clearly.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('PO', 'GSL')                  # Packing and label generation happen equally often
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),                  # Availability check only after receiving the order
        ('RI', 'CA'),                  # Reservation only after availability is confirmed
        ('PI', 'RI'),                  # Picking only after reservation
        ('QC', 'PI'),                  # Quality check follows picking
        ('PO', 'QC'),                  # Packing only after quality check
        ('GSL', 'PO'),                 # Label generation only after packing
        ('D', 'GSL'),                  # Dispatch only after label generation
        ('IC', 'D'),                   # Invoicing only after dispatch
        ('RP', 'IC')                   # Payment recording only after invoicing
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),                  # After receiving, availability must eventually be checked
        ('CA', 'RI'),                  # After availability, items must eventually be reserved
        ('RI', 'PI'),                  # After reservation, picking must eventually occur
        ('PI', 'QC'),                  # After picking, quality check follows eventually
        ('QC', 'PO'),                  # After quality check, packing must occur eventually
        ('PO', 'GSL'),                 # After packing, a shipping label is generated
        ('GSL', 'D'),                  # After labeling, dispatch must happen
        ('D', 'IC'),                   # After dispatch, the invoice is generated
        ('IC', 'RP')                   # After invoicing, payment recording eventually happens
    },
    'never_together': set(),           # No mutually exclusive activities in this model
    'activ_freq': {                    # Allowed frequency of activities per case
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {0, 1}                   # Payment recording might not occur yet
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('QC', 'PO'),                  # Packing happens right after QC
        ('PO', 'GSL'),                 # Label generation follows packing immediately
        ('GSL', 'D')                   # Dispatch follows label generation immediately
    }
}
