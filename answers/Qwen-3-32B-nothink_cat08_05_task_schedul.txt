# **Advanced Process Mining and Scheduling Strategy for Precision Parts Inc.**

---

## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

To begin, we will leverage **process mining** to reconstruct and analyze the **actual workflow** of jobs and tasks across the shop floor using the detailed event logs. This approach will provide a **fact-based understanding** of how the shop floor is performing and will form the foundation for our scheduling strategy.

### **1.1 Reconstructing Job and Task Flows**

- **Event Log Analysis:** Using **ProM**, **DiscoveredProcess**, or **Celonis**, we will apply **alpha miner**, **heuristics miner**, and **inductive miner** algorithms to discover the **actual process models** for each job type or routing.
- **Task Sequences and Paths:** Reconstruct the **task sequences** for each job, including setup times, waiting times, and machine assignments. This will help identify **common routings**, **variant routings**, and **unusual deviations** from expected paths.

### **1.2 Quantifying Key Scheduling Metrics**

#### **A. Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan**
- **Flow Time:** Time from job release to job completion.
- **Lead Time:** Time from order receipt to delivery (if available).
- **Makespan:** Total time from first job to last job completion.
- **Distribution Analysis:** Use **histograms**, **box plots**, and **Pareto analysis** to understand the **variability and outliers** in these metrics.

#### **B. Task Waiting Times (Queue Times)**
- **Queue Time per Machine:** Calculate the time a job spends waiting in the queue for a machine.
- **Heatmaps and Distributions:** Visualize the **average and median queue times** per machine and identify **high-queue work centers**.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Determine if queue times are correlated with **machine utilization**, **job complexity**, or **setup times**.

#### **C. Resource Utilization**
- **Machine Utilization:** Calculate **productive time**, **idle time**, and **setup time** as a percentage of total machine time.
- **Operator Utilization:** Analyze **idle time between tasks**, **concurrent vs. sequential job handling**, and **operator availability**.
- **Bottleneck Identification:** Machines with **high utilization + high queue times** are likely **bottlenecks**.

#### **D. Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Analysis**
- **Setup Time Matrix:** Build a **setup time matrix** for each machine based on **job type transitions** (e.g., from Job A to Job B).
- **Setup Time Variance:** Use **clustering and regression** to identify **setup time patterns** and **drivers** (e.g., material type, tooling change).
- **Setup Time Optimization Potential:** Identify **job groupings** or **sequences** that reduce total setup time.

#### **E. Schedule Adherence and Tardiness**
- **Tardiness Calculation:** For each job, compute **lateness** as max(0, completion time - due date).
- **Tardiness Distribution:** Analyze **average, median, and max tardiness** per machine, job type, or priority.
- **Tardiness Drivers:** Use **root cause analysis** (e.g., **decision trees** or **random forests**) to identify **factors** (e.g., setup time, machine breakdowns) that most contribute to lateness.

#### **F. Impact of Disruptions**
- **Breakdown Impact Analysis:** Calculate **downtime**, **rework**, and **delay propagation** from each breakdown.
- **Hot Job Impact:** Analyze how **priority changes** affect **other jobs** in the system (e.g., **push vs. pull scheduling**).
- **Disruption Propagation:** Use **process mining causality analysis** to trace **disruption ripple effects** across the shop floor.

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

Using the insights from the process mining analysis, we will diagnose key **scheduling pathologies** that are contributing to the company’s performance issues.

### **2.2 Poor Task Prioritization**
- **High-Priority Job Delays:** Use **variant analysis** to compare **on-time vs. late jobs** and identify **common causes**.
- **Priority Inversion:** Detect **situations** where **low-priority jobs** are scheduled before **high-priority ones**.
- **Priority vs. Due Date Alignment:** Check if **priority changes** align with **due dates** or if they are **reactive** to customer pressure.

### **2.3 Suboptimal Sequencing and Setup Times**
- **Setup Time Analysis:** Use **sequence mining** to identify **setup patterns** and **suboptimal sequences**.
- **Setup Time Variability:** Compare **planned vs. actual setup times** and identify **estimation errors**.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

### **3.1 Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules**
- **Local vs. Global Scheduling:** Static rules (e.g., FCFS, EDD) lack **global visibility** and do not account for **machine availability**, **setup costs**, or **downstream impact**.
- **Inflexibility in Dynamic Environments:** Cannot adapt to **hot jobs**, **machine breakdowns**, or **setup constraints**.

### **3.2 Lack of Real-Time Visibility**
- **Delayed Decision-Making:** Scheduling decisions are often **reactive**, not **proactive**.
- **Information Silos:** Each work center operates in **isolation**, with **no centralized view** of shop floor status.

### **3.3 Inaccurate Task and Setup Time Estimations**
- **Overly Optimistic Planning:** Use of **planned durations** without **historical corrections**.
- **Setup Time Ignorance:** Setup times are often **ignored or underestimated** in scheduling.

### **3.4 Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups**
- **No Setup-Aware Scheduling:** Jobs are scheduled without considering **setup compatibility** or **setup costs**.
- **Setup Time Variability:** No **adaptive setup time models** are in place.

### **3.5 Poor Coordination Between Work Centers**
- **Lack of Coordination Logic:** No **inter-machine coordination** or **look-ahead scheduling**.
- **Queue Spillover:** No **WIP control mechanisms** or **pull-based scheduling**.

### **3.6 Inadequate Disruption Response**
- **No Buffer or Contingency Planning:** No **buffer jobs** or **priority override logic**.
- **Manual Re-scheduling:** Disruptions are handled **manually**, leading to **inconsistency** and **delays**.

### **3.7 Differentiating Scheduling Logic vs. Resource Limitations**
- **Throughput Analysis:** If throughput is **below capacity**, it may be a **scheduling issue**.
- **Queue Time Analysis:** If queue times are **high despite low utilization**, it may be **scheduling inefficiency**.
- **Setup Time Analysis:** High setup times without **batching or grouping** may indicate **scheduling logic flaws**.
