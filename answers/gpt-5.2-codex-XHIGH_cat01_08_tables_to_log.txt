Below is a consolidated **event log** that integrates all tables. Each row is one event, grouped by `order_id` (case), with events sorted chronologically per case.  

**Columns:**  
- **Case ID** (order_id)  
- **Activity**  
- **Timestamp**  
- **Resource** (mapped to names where available)  
- **Attributes** (key–value pairs with relevant data)

### Assumptions & Notes
- Each **order line** is treated as a separate **Item Picked** event.
- Each **delivery record** yields two events: **Order Dispatched** and **Order Arrived**.
- **Payment events** have no specified resource, so Resource is left blank (—).
- Order **1004** has no delivery/invoice/payment data; only available events are logged.
- Resource names were enriched using the provided Resources table.

If you'd like the log in CSV/XES format or need aggregation (e.g., summarize all item picks into one event), let me know.
