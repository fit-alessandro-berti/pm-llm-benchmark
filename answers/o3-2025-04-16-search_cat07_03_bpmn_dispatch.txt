The picture is a BPMN 2.0 (“swim-lane”) process diagram that shows how a computer-hardware shop prepares a customer’s order for shipment.  
Reading from left to right:

POOL & LANES  
• One vertical pool is labelled “Dispatch of goods – Computer Hardware Shop, secretary”.  
• Inside the pool there are two horizontal lanes that split the work:  
1. Logistics (upper lane)  
2. Warehouse (lower lane)

MAIN FLOW

1. Start event “Ship goods” (white circle) is the trigger.  
2. Parallel gateway ( inside a diamond) launches two tracks that run at the same time:  

A. Warehouse lane – “Package goods”  
• If packaging takes longer than 48 h, the attached intermediate timer event (“48 hours”) raises an exception that leads to “Notify customer about delay”, then flows back to the task.  
• When packaging is done, the flow waits at an exclusive merge gateway for the paperwork coming from the Logistics lane.

B. Logistics lane – “Clarify shipment method” (the secretary consults the “Order details” document).  
• Exclusive gateway “Special handling?”  
– If “yes”:  
1) “Get 3 offers from logistic companies”  
2) “Select logistic company and place order”  
3) Exclusive merge gateway joins this branch with the insurance/label branch.  
– If “no”: the flow goes straight to “Check if insurance is required”.  

• Task “Check if insurance is required” (customer information is consulted).  
• Exclusive gateway “If insurance necessary”:  
– If insurance is needed, “Insure parcel” is performed, then rejoins the main line.  
– Regardless of the insurance decision, the process always continues to “Write package label”.

3. Once labelling (and, if relevant, choosing the carrier) is finished, a parallel-join gateway () synchronises the Logistics branch with the Warehouse branch that has been waiting at its merge gateway.

4. Combined flow proceeds in the Warehouse lane:  
• “Fill out shipment paperwork”  
• “Move package to pickup area”

5. End event “Shipment prepared” (bold circle) terminates the process.

KEY POINTS TO NOTICE

• Concurrency: packaging is done while the secretary handles administrative steps.  
• Decision logic: two exclusive gateways determine (a) whether special handling is needed and (b) whether insurance is required.  
• Escalation: the timer boundary event on “Package goods” automatically informs the customer if packaging exceeds 48 hours.  
• Synchronization: two parallel gateways (one split, one join) make sure physical preparation and paperwork finish before the shipment is declared ready.
