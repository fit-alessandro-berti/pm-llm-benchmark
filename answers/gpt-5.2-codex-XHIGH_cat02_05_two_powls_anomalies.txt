Below is a structured analysis of the two POWL models, the anomalies they contain, and a judgment on which one is closer to a normative HiretoRetire workflow.

##  Normative HiretoRetire Sequence (Baseline)

A typical highlevel hiring flow is:

```
Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision
 Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case
```

Key expectations:

- **Screening precedes interviews.**
- **Interviews precede the hiring decision.**
- **Onboarding and payroll occur only after the hire.**
- **Payroll is mandatory once hired.**
- **No step should occur after closing the case.**

#  Model1 Analysis

### Structure
```
Post  Screen  (Interview || Decide)  Onboard  Payroll  Close
```

### Anomalies
1. **Hiring decision not dependent on interview**
   - Interview and decision are parallel after screening.
   - Decision can occur **before** interviews.
2. **Interviews can occur after onboarding/payroll/closure**
   - Because interview has no dependency to later steps.
3. **Case can be closed before interviews**
   - A serious logical violation.

### Severity
**High**: The decision to hire can be made and the employee onboarded before the interview occurs, which fundamentally violates selection logic.

#  Model2 Analysis

### Structure
```
Post  (Screen || Interview)  Decide  Loop(Onboard)  XOR(Payroll, skip)  Close
```

### Anomalies
1. **Screening not ordered before interview or decision**
   - Interviews may happen before screening; screening might even occur after decision.
2. **Onboarding loop**
   - Onboarding can repeat multiple times (rework).
3. **Payroll optional**
   - Adding to payroll can be skipped entirely.

### Severity
- **Moderate**: Screening order is wrong.
- **Moderate**: Onboarding repetition is unusual.
- **High**: Skipping payroll is a serious deviation because paying the employee is essential.

#  Which Model is Closer to the Normative Process?

### **Model1 is closer.**
Despite a **critical ordering error** (decision not following interviews), Model1:

- Preserves the standard linear flow from decision onward.
- Keeps **all steps mandatory**.
- Requires fewer corrections to match the normative sequence (only one precedence relation is missing).

Model2 introduces **multiple structural deviations**: parallel screening/interviews, a loop on onboarding, and **optional payroll**, all of which significantly diverge from a standard HiretoRetire process.

---

##  Final Verdict

 **Model1** is **more aligned** with a normative HiretoRetire process, although it still contains a **serious** logic flaw.  
Model2 adds several structural deviations that make it further from a standard flow.

If you would like, I can also propose corrected versions of each model.
