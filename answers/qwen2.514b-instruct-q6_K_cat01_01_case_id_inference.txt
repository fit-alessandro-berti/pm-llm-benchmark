To group the events logically based on the provided attributes and inferred context, we will analyze each event based on common factors such as `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, `timestamp` proximity, and typical medical workflows to determine likely cases.

**Case 1 (Patient Age: 45, Gender: M)**
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z, activity: Register patient, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z, activity: Initial triage, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z, activity: Patient discharged, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M

**Case 2 (Patient Age: 62, Gender: F)**
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z, activity: Register patient, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z, activity: Initial triage, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z, activity: Lab test requested, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z, activity: Lab test completed, department: Laboratory, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, activity: Doctor consultation, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z, activity: Prescription created, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z, activity: Patient discharged, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F

**Case 3 (Patient Age: 28, Gender: M)**
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, activity: Register patient, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z, activity: Doctor consultation, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, activity: Surgery preparation, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, activity: Surgery performed, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z, activity: Recovery room, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M
- timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z, activity: Patient discharged, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M

These groupings are based on the assumption that events for each patient follow a coherent sequence of activities typically seen in healthcare settings. Each case is linked by shared personal attributes (age and gender) and a logical progression through different departments over time.
