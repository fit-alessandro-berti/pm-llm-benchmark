This image is a **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram** illustrating the workflow for the **"Dispatch of goods"** at a **"Computer Hardware Shop."**

The process is organized into three horizontal lanes representing the departments or roles involved: **Logistics, Secretary, and Warehouse.**

### Overall Process Flow

The process begins with a "Ship goods" event in the Secretary lane and concludes with a "Shipment prepared" end event in the Warehouse lane.

#### 1. Initial Split
As soon as the process starts, it hits a parallel gateway, splitting the workflow into two simultaneous paths:
*   **Secretary's path:** Focuses on logistics and administration.
*   **Warehouse's path:** Focuses on the physical preparation of the goods.

#### 2. Secretary Lane (Administrative Path)
The Secretary first performs the task **"Clarify shipment method"**, which uses **"Order details"** as input. Then, a decision is made based on whether "Special handling?" is required:

*   **If Yes:** The secretary must **"Get 3 offers from logistic companies"** and then **"Select logistic company and place order."**
*   **If No:** The secretary must **"Check if insurance is required"** (using a **"Customer information"** data store).
    *   This leads to an inclusive gateway where two things can happen:
        1.  **"Write package label"** (this happens always).
        2.  **"Insure parcel"** (this happens only "If insurance necessary," involving a task in the **Logistics** lane).
    *   These tasks merge back together before joining the main administrative flow.

#### 3. Warehouse Lane (Physical Path)
Simultaneously with the Secretary's tasks, the Warehouse begins the **"Package goods"** task. 
*   This task has a 48-hour timer. If the packaging takes longer than 48 hours, an intermediate event triggers a sub-process to **"Notify customer about delay."**

#### 4. Convergence and Completion
Once both the administrative tasks (from the Secretary/Logistics) and the physical tasks (from the Warehouse) are finished, the paths meet at another parallel gateway in the Warehouse lane.

The final steps are:
1.  **Fill out shipment paperwork.**
2.  **Move package to pickup area.**
3.  The process ends at the **"Shipment prepared"** event.
