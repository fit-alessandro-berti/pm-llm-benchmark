# Temporal Profile Anomaly Analysis for Insurance Claim Handling

## Executive Overview

The temporal profile model reveals several significant deviations from expected process behavior in the insurance claim handling workflow. The anomalies identified suggest potential systemic issues ranging from overly rigid automation to substantial process bottlenecks. This analysis examines each anomaly in detail, proposes root cause hypotheses, and provides concrete SQL-based verification methods to investigate the underlying factors affecting claim processing timing.

The temporal relationships between activities should ideally reflect a predictable, controlled process where timing variations can be attributed to legitimate business factors such as claim complexity, resource availability, or customer responsiveness. When these relationships deviate substantially from expected patterns—whether through suspiciously consistent timing, unusually rapid transitions, or extended delays—they often signal process inefficiencies, data quality issues, or systemic problems requiring intervention.

---

## Section 1: Identified Temporal Anomalies

### Anomaly 1: Suspiciously Consistent Approval Time (R  P)

The temporal profile shows an average interval of 90,000 seconds (approximately 25 hours) between claim receipt and approval, with an extraordinarily low standard deviation of just 3,600 seconds (1 hour). This represents a coefficient of variation of approximately 4%, which is unusually tight for a process involving human decision-making and multiple organizational steps.

In a realistic insurance claims environment, approval times naturally exhibit significant variation based on claim complexity, documentation completeness, severity levels, and adjuster workload. A process that consistently produces approval times within a 4% margin of the mean suggests one of several unlikely scenarios: either the approval decision is pre-determined before evaluation occurs, the timestamps are being artificially generated or manipulated, or certain approval pathways are being bypassed entirely in favor of automated or expedited processing.

The concern here is not merely statistical—it raises questions about whether meaningful evaluation is occurring before approval decisions are made. Claims that move from receipt to approval with such mechanical consistency may indicate that the evaluation stage (E) is being circumvented, that approval decisions are based on automated rules without substantive human review, or that data entry timestamps are inaccurate.

### Anomaly 2: Extended Notification Delay (P  N)

The approval-to-notification interval presents a stark contrast to the previous anomaly, with an average delay of 604,800 seconds (7 days) and a substantial standard deviation of 172,800 seconds (2 days). This combination of extended duration and high variability represents a significant process bottleneck that affects customer experience and operational efficiency.

A week-long average delay between claim approval and customer notification is concerning for several reasons. First, once a claim has been approved, there is minimal business justification for delaying notification to the customer—the value proposition for the customer has been established, and delay only extends the uncertainty period. Second, the high standard deviation indicates that some claims are notified within a day while others languish for two weeks or more, suggesting that notification is not driven by standardized business rules but rather by ad-hoc processing or resource availability.

This anomaly may indicate a disconnect between the claims approval function and the customer communication function, potentially reflecting organizational silos, inadequate notification systems, or prioritization issues where approved claims sit in queues awaiting communication processing.

### Anomaly 3: Premature Claim Closure (A  C)

The temporal profile reveals an average interval of only 7,200 seconds (2 hours) between adjuster assignment and claim closure, with a standard deviation of 3,600 seconds (1 hour). This is particularly alarming given that the intended process flow requires evaluation (E) and approval (P) activities to occur between assignment and closure.

A claim that progresses from assignment directly to closure within two hours—without evidence of evaluation or approval activities—suggests one of several problematic scenarios. The most concerning possibility is that claims are being closed without proper evaluation, potentially to manipulate closure statistics or reduce pending claim inventories. Alternatively, the evaluation and approval activities may be occurring but being recorded with incorrect activity codes or timestamps, creating a misleading audit trail. A third possibility is that certain claim types are being fast-tracked through abbreviated workflows, but this would require explicit business rules that should be documented and monitored.

Regardless of the root cause, claims closing rapidly after assignment without documented evaluation represent a significant control weakness that could lead to inappropriate claim denials, fraud vulnerability, or regulatory compliance issues.

### Anomaly 4: Mechanically Rapid Notification (E  N)

The average interval of just 300 seconds (5 minutes) between claim evaluation and customer notification, with a standard deviation of only 60 seconds (1 minute), creates another suspicious pattern. The coefficient of variation here is approximately 20%, which is low, but the absolute duration is so brief that it raises questions about what activities can realistically occur within that window.

A five-minute turnaround between completing evaluation and notifying the customer is operationally improbable in most scenarios. The evaluation activity presumably involves reviewing claim documentation, assessing coverage, calculating settlement amounts, and preparing approval documentation. Immediately transmitting this information to customers within a five-minute window suggests either that notification is automated and triggered immediately upon evaluation completion, that the evaluation itself is superficial, or that notification activities are being backdated or recorded with incorrect timestamps.

This pattern could indicate automated notification systems that trigger immediately upon evaluation completion without appropriate human review, or it could reflect data quality issues where timestamps are being batch-processed rather than recorded at actual activity times.

---

## Section 2: Hypotheses for Observed Anomalies

### Hypotheses for the R  P Approval Consistency Anomaly

The suspiciously consistent approval time between receipt and approval may stem from several root causes that warrant investigation. One primary hypothesis is that approval decisions are being pre-determined through automated rules-based processing, where claims meeting certain criteria are automatically flagged for approval without substantive human evaluation. This would explain both the tight timing consistency and the minimal variation—the system identifies approvable claims and routes them through an expedited workflow that produces uniform timing regardless of claim-specific factors.

Another hypothesis focuses on data integrity issues. If timestamp recording is occurring through batch processes rather than real-time event capture, the recorded times may reflect when batches were processed rather than when activities actually occurred. This would create artificially consistent intervals that are artifacts of data processing schedules rather than genuine process characteristics.

A third hypothesis suggests that certain claim categories (perhaps lower-value claims or claims from preferred customer segments) are being processed through an abbreviated workflow where the evaluation stage is either skipped or de minimis. In this scenario, the recorded "evaluation" activity may be nominal, with substantive review occurring only at the approval stage, resulting in compressed overall timelines.

### Hypotheses for the P  N Notification Delay Anomaly

The extended and variable delay between approval and notification likely reflects organizational or systemic factors rather than claim-specific characteristics. The leading hypothesis is that notification activities are not integrated into the core claims processing workflow but instead constitute a separate function with its own queue and prioritization logic. When claims move to "approved" status, they may enter a notification queue that is processed periodically rather than continuously, creating batch effects where notification delays vary based on queue processing schedules.

Resource constraints in the notification function could also explain both the average delay magnitude and the high variability. If notification processing requires manual tasks such as generating customized communication letters, coordinating with external payment systems, or updating multiple downstream systems, limited staffing or system capacity could create persistent backlogs that fluctuate based on incoming volume and resource availability.

A third hypothesis suggests that the notification delay may be intentionally built into the process for business reasons that are not reflected in the temporal profile documentation. For example, insurers might delay notification to allow for fraud verification checks, to coordinate payment processing windows, or to batch communications for efficiency. However, a one-week average delay for such purposes would be unusually long and would typically be documented in formal process definitions.

### Hypotheses for the A  C Premature Closure Anomaly

Claims closing rapidly after assignment without documented intermediate activities represent a significant control concern with several potential explanations. The most serious hypothesis is that adjusters or automated systems are inappropriately closing claims to manipulate performance metrics. If adjuster compensation or evaluation is heavily influenced by closure rates or average handling times, there may be incentive to close claims quickly even when investigation is incomplete.

Alternatively, this pattern could result from systematic misclassification of activities. If evaluation activities are being recorded with incorrect activity codes—for example, if "Evaluate" events are being logged as "Close" events due to user interface issues or training deficiencies—the temporal profile would incorrectly suggest that claims are closing without evaluation. This hypothesis is supported if the overall claim outcomes (approval rates, customer satisfaction, appeal rates) for rapidly closed claims are similar to those for claims with full evaluation cycles.

A third hypothesis involves exception processing for specific claim categories. Certain claim types—such as small-value claims, claims with clear liability, or claims from commercial policyholders—might legitimately be processed through expedited workflows that bypass standard evaluation stages. However, such exceptions should be explicitly defined, monitored, and distinguished from standard claims in the temporal analysis.

### Hypotheses for the E  N Rapid Notification Anomaly

The mechanically rapid transition between evaluation and notification likely reflects either automated system behavior or data recording issues. The primary hypothesis is that notification generation is fully automated and triggered immediately upon evaluation completion through system integration. While automation is generally desirable for efficiency, immediate notification upon evaluation completion may bypass required approval steps, quality assurance reviews, or manual verification that evaluation conclusions are appropriate before customer communication.

A second hypothesis concerns timestamp accuracy. If evaluation completion and notification triggering occur through the same batch process or system event, the recorded timestamps may not reflect the actual temporal sequence of activities. The system might record both events with the same timestamp or with minimal differentiation, creating an artificial appearance of instantaneous processing.

Resource allocation patterns could also contribute to this anomaly. If notification activities are prioritized during specific work periods (such as the beginning or end of a workday), and evaluation activities cluster around the same times due to adjuster work patterns, the combination could produce consistently short intervals that reflect scheduling patterns rather than actual processing time.

## Section 3: SQL-Based Verification Approaches

### Verification Query 1: Identify Claims with Suspiciously Consistent R  P Intervals

This query identifies claims where the receipt-to-approval interval falls within a narrow range around the average, potentially flagging cases for review of whether meaningful evaluation occurred. The query calculates the actual interval in hours and filters for claims where the duration falls within one standard deviation of the mean (between 24 and 26 hours), representing the tightest portion of the distribution.

```sql
-- Identify claims with suspiciously consistent R to P timing
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.customer_id,
    r.timestamp AS receive_timestamp,
    p.timestamp AS approve_timestamp,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) / 3600.0 AS hours_between,
    a.name AS assigned_adjuster,
    a.specialization,
    a.region
FROM claims c
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT timestamp, resource 
    FROM claim_events 
    WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'R'
    ORDER BY timestamp ASC
    LIMIT 1
) r
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT timestamp 
    FROM claim_events 
    WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'P'
    ORDER BY timestamp ASC
    LIMIT 1
) p
JOIN claim_events ce_r ON r.timestamp = ce_r.timestamp AND ce_r.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce_p ON p.timestamp = ce_p.timestamp AND ce_p.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ce_r.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR OR ce_p.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) BETWEEN 86400 AND 93600  -- 24-26 hours
    AND c.submission_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
ORDER BY hours_between;
```

This query should be supplemented with additional analysis to verify whether evaluation activities actually occurred for these claims. A follow-up query can check for the presence of evaluation events and assess whether their timestamps suggest meaningful review occurred.

### Verification Query 2: Analyze P  N Delay Distribution by Segment

This query examines the approval-to-notification interval across different dimensions to identify whether the delay is evenly distributed or concentrated in specific segments. Segmenting by claim type, adjuster, region, and claim amount helps determine whether the bottleneck is systemic or localized to particular operational areas.

```sql
-- Analyze P to N delays with segmentation
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    a.region,
    a.specialization,
    CASE 
        WHEN c.claim_amount < 1000 THEN 'Low Value'
        WHEN c.claim_amount < 10000 THEN 'Medium Value'
        ELSE 'High Value'
    END AS value_segment,
    COUNT(*) AS claim_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) / 86400.0)::INTEGER AS avg_days,
    MIN(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) / 86400.0)::INTEGER AS min_days,
    MAX(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) / 86400.0)::INTEGER AS max_days,
    STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) / 86400.0)::NUMERIC(10,2) AS stdev_days,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) / 86400.0)::INTEGER AS median_days
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events p ON c.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
JOIN claim_events n ON c.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
    AND n.timestamp > p.timestamp
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON p.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
WHERE p.timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '180 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4
ORDER BY avg_days DESC;
```

Analysis of the results should focus on identifying segments with disproportionately high average delays. If certain claim types or regions show dramatically worse performance than others, the bottleneck may be addressable through targeted resource allocation or process redesign for those specific areas.

### Verification Query 3: Detect Claims Closing Without Intermediate Activities

This query identifies claims where closure occurs within a short time after assignment without documented evaluation or approval activities. The query establishes baseline timing thresholds based on the temporal profile and flags claims that close within two standard deviations of the A  C mean without intermediate events.

```sql
-- Identify claims closing rapidly after assignment without evaluation
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.submission_date,
    a.timestamp AS assign_timestamp,
    c_ev.timestamp AS close_timestamp,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_ev.timestamp - a.timestamp)) / 3600.0 AS hours_assign_to_close,
    a.resource AS assigned_adjuster,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events ev WHERE ev.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ev.activity = 'E') AS eval_events,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events ev WHERE ev.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ev.activity = 'P') AS approval_events,
    c.additional_info AS claim_notes
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events a ON c.claim_id = a.claim_id AND a.activity = 'A'
JOIN claim_events c_ev ON c.claim_id = c_ev.claim_id AND c_ev.activity = 'C'
    AND c_ev.timestamp > a.timestamp
LEFT JOIN claim_events eval ON c.claim_id = eval.claim_id AND eval.activity = 'E'
    AND eval.timestamp BETWEEN a.timestamp AND c_ev.timestamp
LEFT JOIN claim_events appr ON c.claim_id = appr.claim_id AND appr.activity = 'P'
    AND appr.timestamp BETWEEN a.timestamp AND c_ev.timestamp
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_ev.timestamp - a.timestamp)) <= 14400  -- Within 4 hours
    AND eval.event_id IS NULL
    AND appr.event_id IS NULL
    AND c.submission_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
ORDER BY hours_assign_to_close ASC;
```

Claims returned by this query require immediate review to determine whether premature closure was appropriate. The review should assess whether claims were properly investigated, whether customers received appropriate outcomes, and whether closure was justified based on claim characteristics or should be reclassified as improper.

### Verification Query 4: Correlate E  N Timing with System and Resource Factors

This query examines the rapid evaluation-to-notification interval in context, correlating timing with factors that might explain whether the rapid transition is driven by automation, adjuster behavior, or data quality issues. The analysis separates claims based on whether evaluation and notification were performed by the same resource and examines timing patterns by hour of day.

```sql
-- Analyze E to N timing patterns and correlations
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN e.resource = n.resource THEN 'Same Resource'
        ELSE 'Different Resources'
    END AS resource_pattern,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM e.timestamp) AS eval_hour,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM n.timestamp) AS notify_hour,
    COUNT(*) AS event_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) / 60.0)::INTEGER AS avg_minutes,
    MIN(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) / 60.0)::INTEGER AS min_minutes,
    MAX(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) / 60.0)::INTEGER AS max_minutes,
    CASE WHEN e.resource = n.resource THEN 'Automated/Same Person' ELSE 'Handoff Required' END AS likely_process_type
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id 
    AND n.activity = 'N'
    AND n.timestamp > e.timestamp
    AND n.timestamp < e.timestamp + INTERVAL '30 minutes'  -- Only very rapid transitions
JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E'
    AND e.timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY avg_minutes ASC;
```

This query helps distinguish between legitimate rapid processing (same resource handling both activities efficiently) and suspicious patterns (different resources with implausibly short intervals suggesting timestamp issues). Segments showing consistently sub-five-minute transitions with different resources handling evaluation and notification warrant investigation for data integrity problems.

### Verification Query 5: Comprehensive Anomaly Scoring for Prioritized Investigation

This query synthesizes multiple anomaly indicators into a composite score that allows investigators to prioritize claims most likely to represent process failures. Each claim receives points based on the severity and combination of anomalies it exhibits, enabling efficient allocation of review resources.

```sql
-- Score claims by anomaly severity for prioritized review
WITH claim_timing AS (
    SELECT 
        c.claim_id,
        c.claim_type,
        c.claim_amount,
        MAX(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END) AS receive_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END) AS assign_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN e.timestamp END) AS eval_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) AS notify_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) AS close_time
    FROM claims c
    JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
    WHERE c.submission_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
    GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
),
anomaly_flags AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        claim_type,
        claim_amount,
        receive_time,
        assign_time,
        eval_time,
        approve_time,
        notify_time,
        close_time,
        
        -- Flag 1: Suspiciously consistent R to P (24-26 hours)
        CASE 
            WHEN approve_time IS NOT NULL 
            AND receive_time IS NOT NULL
            AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) BETWEEN 86400 AND 93600 
            THEN 1 ELSE 0 
        END AS flag_rp_consistent,
        
        -- Flag 2: Extended P to N delay (over 7 days)
        CASE 
            WHEN notify_time IS NOT NULL 
            AND approve_time IS NOT NULL
            AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) > 604800 
            THEN 1 ELSE 0 
        END AS flag_pn_delayed,
        
        -- Flag 3: Rapid A to C without E or P
        CASE 
            WHEN close_time IS NOT NULL 
            AND assign_time IS NOT NULL
            AND eval_time IS NULL 
            AND approve_time IS NULL
            AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) < 14400 
            THEN 1 ELSE 0 
        END AS flag_rapid_close,
        
        -- Flag 4: Very rapid E to N (under 10 minutes)
        CASE 
            WHEN notify_time IS NOT NULL 
            AND eval_time IS NOT NULL
            AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - eval_time)) < 600 
            THEN 1 ELSE 0 
        END AS flag_rapid_notify
    FROM claim_timing
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    claim_type,
    claim_amount,
    receive_time,
    assign_time,
    eval_time,
    approve_time,
    notify_time,
    close_time,
    (flag_rp_consistent + flag_pn_delayed + flag_rapid_close + flag_rapid_notify) AS anomaly_score,
    CASE 
        WHEN flag_rp_consistent = 1 AND flag_rapid_close = 1 
        THEN 'CRITICAL: Bypassed evaluation with automated approval'
        WHEN flag_rapid_close = 1 
        THEN 'HIGH: Premature closure without evaluation'
        WHEN flag_pn_delayed = 1 
        THEN 'MEDIUM: Extended notification delay'
        WHEN flag_rp_consistent = 1 
        THEN 'MEDIUM: Suspicious approval timing'
        WHEN flag_rapid_notify = 1 
        THEN 'LOW: Rapid notification pattern'
        ELSE 'No significant anomalies'
    END AS primary_concern
FROM anomaly_flags
WHERE (flag_rp_consistent + flag_pn_delayed + flag_rapid_close + flag_rapid_notify) >= 1
ORDER BY anomaly_score DESC, claim_amount DESC;
```

This scoring approach enables investigators to focus first on claims exhibiting multiple anomalies (score of 2 or higher), which are more likely to represent significant process failures than claims showing only a single timing irregularity.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The temporal profile analysis reveals a claims handling process with several significant control weaknesses and efficiency opportunities. The combination of suspiciously consistent approval times, extended notification delays, premature closures, and mechanically rapid transitions suggests that the process may not be operating as intended, with potential implications for claim quality, customer satisfaction, and regulatory compliance.

Priority investigation should focus on claims exhibiting multiple anomaly indicators, particularly those closing rapidly after assignment without evaluation or those showing both suspiciously consistent approval timing and bypassed evaluation stages. These patterns may indicate systematic issues with process controls, performance pressure leading to inappropriate claim handling, or data integrity problems that obscure actual process behavior.

The SQL verification approaches provided enable systematic investigation across multiple dimensions. Organizations should establish regular monitoring of these temporal patterns, with alert thresholds set based on the standard deviations identified in the temporal profile. Process owners should review cases flagged by these queries to determine whether current workflows require modification, whether additional controls are needed to prevent inappropriate claim handling, or whether system configuration changes are necessary to ensure accurate activity timing capture.
