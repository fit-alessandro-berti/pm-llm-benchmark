Got it  — I’ll present the anomalies, hypotheses, and SQL verification approaches in a structured way without referencing the instructions.

## **1. Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile**

| Activity Pair | Avg Time | STDEV | Observation |
|---------------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **R  P** (Receive  Approve) | ~25 hrs | **1 hr** | Extremely low variability, suggesting rigid, scheduled, or automated approval rather than organically varying process flow. |
| **P  N** (Approve  Notify) | **7 days** | 2 days | Unusually long waiting before notifying the customer, with large variability — some notifications are much faster, others much slower. |
| **A  C** (Assign  Close) | 2 hrs | 1 hr | Very short cycle; suggests claims may sometimes be closed without going through Evaluate/Approve steps. |
| **E  N** (Evaluate  Notify) | 5 mins | 1 min | Almost instantaneous — may indicate automated notification or skipped steps that should occur between evaluation and notification. |

## **2. Hypotheses Explaining the Anomalies**

1. **R  P (Rigid Approval Timing)**  
   - Approvals could be scheduled in a batch job running at fixed intervals.  
   - SLA-enforced deadlines make approvals occur predictably regardless of complexity.  
   - Automated rules accepting certain claim types instantly.

2. **P  N (Delayed Customer Notification)**  
   - Backlog in customer service leading to delays in sending notifications.  
   - Certain cases held for follow-up before notifying customers (e.g., fraud checks).  
   - Notifications dependent on external systems with variable response times.

3. **A  C (Quick Closure)**  
   - Low-value or fraudulent claims closed immediately after assignment.  
   - Administrative reassignment errors mislogged as closures.  
   - Some types of claims (e.g., duplicates) bypass evaluation/approval completely.

4. **E  N (Immediate Notification)**  
   - Automatic emailing triggered the moment evaluation is logged.  
   - Evaluation step might actually occur after customer contact in some cases, but timestamps are entered retrospectively.  
   - System logging out of order due to asynchronous updates.

## **3. SQL Queries to Verify the Hypotheses**

---

### a) Find Claims with Suspiciously Constant R  P Times
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS receive_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) -
                           MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END))) / 3600 AS hours_diff
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) FILTER (WHERE ce.activity IN ('R','P')) = 2
ORDER BY hours_diff;
```
*Purpose:* See if approval happens in a tight time band for most claims (e.g., always ~25 hours).

---

### b) Identify Claims with Excessive P  N Delays
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id,
       c.claim_type,
       a.region,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - p_time)) / 86400 AS days_diff
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id,
           MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS p_time,
           MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') AS n_time
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) t
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = t.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = (
    SELECT resource::INT
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE claim_id = t.claim_id AND activity = 'A'
    LIMIT 1
)
WHERE n_time IS NOT NULL
  AND p_time IS NOT NULL
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - p_time)) / 86400 > 5 -- >5 days
ORDER BY days_diff DESC;
```
*Purpose:* Spot claims with unusually long approval-to-notification intervals and see if they cluster by region or claim type.

---

### c) Detect Claims Closed Soon After Assignment (Possible Premature Closure)
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id,
       c.claim_type,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time))/3600 AS hours_to_close
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id,
           MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'A') AS assign_time,
           MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') AS close_time
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) t
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = t.claim_id
WHERE close_time IS NOT NULL
  AND assign_time IS NOT NULL
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time))/3600 < 3 -- under 3 hours
ORDER BY hours_to_close;
```
*Purpose:* Quantify how many claims close quickly after assignment without evaluation or approval events.

---

### d) Check for Immediate E  N Notifications
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - eval_time))/60 AS minutes_diff
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id,
           MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') AS eval_time,
           MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') AS notify_time
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) t
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = t.claim_id
WHERE notify_time IS NOT NULL
  AND eval_time IS NOT NULL
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - eval_time))/60 <= 10 -- under 10 minutes
ORDER BY minutes_diff;
```
*Purpose:* Identify if immediate notification after evaluation is a common occurrence and in which claim types it happens.

If you'd like, I can also **extend these queries to group by adjuster, customer segment, or claim amount** to pinpoint where anomalies are most prevalent. Would you like me to prepare those extended correlation queries?
