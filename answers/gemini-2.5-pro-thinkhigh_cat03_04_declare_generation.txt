Excellent. Here is a Python dictionary representing the DECLARE model for the described product design and launch process. The rules are constructed based on logical dependencies in a typical workflow.

```python
# DECLARE model for a product design and launch process
# Support and Confidence are set to 1.0, indicating strict, mandatory rules.

product_launch_declare_model = {
    # --- Unary Constraints (on single activities) ---
    
    'existence': {
        # All activities are considered mandatory for a complete, successful process.
        'IG': (1.0, 1.0),
        'DD': (1.0, 1.0),
        'TFC': (1.0, 1.0),
        'CE': (1.0, 1.0),
        'PC': (1.0, 1.0),
        'LT': (1.0, 1.0),
