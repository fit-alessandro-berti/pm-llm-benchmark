Here's a hypothetical temporal profile for a simplified Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process with activities like 'Request', 'Approve', 'Purchase', 'Receive', and 'Pay'. The times are given in seconds, and the standard deviation is assumed to be 10% of the average time.

```python
p2p_temporal_profile = {
    ('Request', 'Approve'): (3600, 360),  # Average: 1 hour, Standard Deviation: 6 minutes
    ('Approve', 'Purchase'): (7200, 720),  # Average: 2 hours, Standard Deviation: 12 minutes
    ('Purchase', 'Receive'): (86400, 8640),  # Average: 1 day, Standard Deviation: 15 minutes
    ('Receive', 'Pay'): (172800, 17280),  # Average: 2 days, Standard Deviation: 30 minutes
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the average times:

- **Request to Approve**: It takes around 1 hour on average for an approval decision after a purchase request is made.
- **Approve to Purchase**: After approval, it takes about 2 hours on average to place the purchase order.
- **Purchase to Receive**: The delivery time averages to 1 day. This can vary significantly depending on the supplier and the product.
- **Receive to Pay**: It takes around 2 days on average for payment after receiving the goods or services. This accounts for processing, quality checks, and invoice matching.

You can adjust these values based on your specific process and data. Also, you might want to consider including more activities (like 'Reject', 'Cancel', 'Return') and their corresponding temporal profiles if they're relevant to your P2P process.
