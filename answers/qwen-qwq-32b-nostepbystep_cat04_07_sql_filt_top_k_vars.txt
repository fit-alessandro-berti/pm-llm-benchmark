Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a DuckDB SQL query that does several things. I need to make sure I understand each part of the problem before jumping into writing the query.

First, the task is to find the process variants, which are the ordered sequences of activities for each case. Each case has a set of activities in a particular order based on their timestamps. So the first thing I need to do is, for each case_id, get the list of activities in the order they were executed. 

So, the first step is to create a sequence for each case. In SQL, I can do this by ordering the activities by timestamp and then concatenating them into a string, maybe separated by some delimiter. Since variants are sequences, the order matters, so the delimiter is important to distinguish between different sequences. Maybe something like using commas or another separator to join the activities in order.

Next, I need to group all cases by this sequence (the variant) and count how many cases each variant has. The top K variants would be those with the highest counts. But how do I get the top K? Well, I can use a window function or a subquery to rank the variants by their count, then filter to the top K. Wait, but in SQL, to get the top K, maybe using a LIMIT clause? But the problem says "top K variants", so the K is a variable here. Since the user didn't specify K's value, maybe in the query, K will be a parameter, but in DuckDB you can use a placeholder like :K. But the user might just need the query structure, so perhaps the query will have a variable K, which the user can input.

Then, after identifying which variants are in the top K, I need to get all the case_ids that belong to those variants. Finally, I need to retrieve all the original event logs entries for those cases.

Putting this together, the plan is:

1. For each case_id, generate the activity sequence as a string (ordered by timestamp).
2. Group by this sequence to count the number of cases per variant.
3. Rank the variants by their counts, take the top K.
4. Get all case_ids that are in these top K variants.
5. Select all events from the original log where case_id is in that filtered list.

Let me think about how to structure the SQL queries. Maybe a common table expression (CTE) approach would help here.

First, the sequence generation. Let's start with creating the sequence for each case. In DuckDB, you can use the array_agg function with an order by. Since we need the ordered list, array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) would create an array, but to make it a string, maybe we can use listagg or array_to_string. Wait, checking DuckDB's functions: there's string_agg. Yes, string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) would give the ordered activities as a comma-separated string. That should form the variant key.

So the first CTE (let's call it case_sequences) would select case_id and the string_agg as the variant. 

Then, the next CTE (variant_counts) would group by the variant, count the number of case_ids, and order by count descending. But we need the top K rows here. Wait, but to get the top K, maybe we can use a window function to rank each variant's count and then filter where the rank <= K. Alternatively, since the count is ordered, we can just take the top K. But since the K is a variable, maybe in the query we can use LIMIT K, but the user might need a parameter. However, the exact syntax for parameters in DuckDB might require using a placeholder like :K. 

Wait, the user's problem says to "determine the top K variants by their frequency". So the final query must include a way to parameterize K. So in the SQL, I should use a placeholder like ? or something, but maybe in DuckDB it's better to use a variable. Let me think about syntax. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the query should have a parameter for K. Let me proceed with using a placeholder, like K is a variable that will be substituted. So in the code, the user can set K as a variable. For example, using a WITH clause with a variable, but I might need to structure it so that the query can take K as an input parameter. But since I'm writing a query, perhaps using a placeholder like :K.

Putting this together, the steps would be:

1. Create a CTE to get each case's activity sequence as a string.
2. Then, create another CTE to count how many cases per variant (the string).
3. Then, select those variants in the top K by count. To do this, perhaps rank them with a row_number() window function, ordered by the count descending, and then select those with rank <= K. Alternatively, since we can just sort and take top K, but window function might be more reliable to handle ties if K is a specific number. But if two variants have the same count, which one to take? The problem doesn't specify handling ties, so perhaps just take the first K, even if there are ties. So using row_number() might be better to get exactly top K. 

Wait, for example: if two variants have the same count, and K=2, then they both get included. But row_number would give them different ranks, but maybe using dense_rank() would give them the same rank, allowing for inclusion even if there are ties. Hmm, but the problem says "top K variants by their frequency". Maybe the user expects the top K counts, so if there are ties, they may or may not be included. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the simplest is to use a window function with row_number() partitioned by nothing, ordered by count DESC, and then pick those with row_number <= K. But that would only take the first K, even if there are ties. Alternatively, using the count and taking all those with count equal to or higher than the Kth row, but that complicates things. The problem says "top K variants by their frequency", so the straightforward approach is to take the first K, regardless of ties. So using row_number() would be better here. 

Alternatively, maybe it's better to just order the variants by count descending, then select the top K with a LIMIT clause. But in DuckDB, the LIMIT is applied after the window functions. Wait, perhaps the process is:

- First, create the variants with their counts. Then, select the top K variants (ordered by count descending, then maybe by some other column like the variant name if counts are equal?), then get their variants, and then join back to the original cases.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

1. Create the case_sequences CTE as:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)

Then, the count per variant:

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY frequency DESC
)

Then, the top K variants would be the first K rows from this. So selecting variant from variant_counts, order by frequency desc, limit K. 

But to get the case_ids that are part of those top variants, we need to get the variants in that top K list, then join back with case_sequences to get their case_ids, then finally get all events from event_log where case_id is in those case_ids. 

Wait, but how to combine all these steps into a single query. Let me outline the steps again:

The final output is all events from the event_log where their case_id is in the set of case_ids that belong to the top K variants. 

So the steps:

- For each case, compute its variant (the sequence).
- For each variant, compute how many cases have it (frequency).
- Find all variants that are among the top K by frequency.
- Collect all case_ids that have those variants.
- Select the original events where case_id is in that list.

Therefore, the steps can be written as nested CTEs.

Putting this into SQL:

First, create the variant for each case:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),

Then, compute the counts and select the top K variants. Let's see:

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
)

Then, the top K variants would be those with rank <= K. So, the variants in the top K can be selected as:

SELECT variant
FROM variant_counts
WHERE rank <= :K

Then, the case_ids for these variants are those in case_sequences where variant is in that list. Then, finally, select the original event_log entries where case_id is in that case_ids list.

Putting this all together, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.variant = vc.variant
    WHERE vc.rank <= :K
)

Wait, but the variant_counts already has variant and rank. Wait, let me structure this correctly. Let me think again:

The steps in CTEs:

case_sequences: case_id and variant.

variant_counts: for each variant, count and rank (or just count, then rank them).

Wait, perhaps the variant_counts with row_number would look like:

variant_counts_with_rank AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
)

Then, the top K variants are those with rn <= K.

Then, the case_ids are those where their variant is in the list of top K variants.

So the case_ids can be obtained via:

SELECT case_id
FROM case_sequences
WHERE variant IN (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts_with_rank
    WHERE rn <= :K
)

Then, the final event_log entries are those with case_id in that subquery.

Alternatively, to structure this as a single query with CTEs and joins:

Putting it all together:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts_with_rank AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts_with_rank
    WHERE rn <= :K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
JOIN top_variants tv ON cs.variant = tv.variant;

Wait, but this might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, the subquery to get case_ids can be done more efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE variant IN (
        SELECT variant
        FROM variant_counts_with_rank
        WHERE rn <= :K
    )
);

But the case_sequences is needed to get the variant for each case, then check if that variant is in the top K variants.

Hmm. Let me check if this works step by step.

Let me think about the first step: the case_sequences CTE correctly aggregates the activities in the correct order. Using string_agg with order by timestamp ensures that the activities are in the correct sequence.

Then, in variant_counts_with_rank, for each variant, count the number of case_ids (since each case has exactly one variant, the COUNT(*) gives the frequency). The row_number() assigns a rank to each variant based on their frequency, so the most frequent is rank 1, etc.

Then, top_variants holds the variants with rank <= K. Then, the case_ids that have those variants are the ones we want. 

So the final SELECT from event_log needs to find all events where their case_id is part of a case that has a variant in the top K.

Thus, the subquery for case_id can be written as:

SELECT case_id
FROM case_sequences
WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)

Therefore, putting all together:

The final query would be:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts_with_rank AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts_with_rank
    WHERE rn <= :K  -- :K is a parameter for K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    JOIN top_variants tv ON cs.variant = tv.variant
);

Wait, but the IN clause for case_id can be written as:

e.case_id IN (SELECT cs.case_id FROM case_sequences cs JOIN top_variants tv ON cs.variant = tv.variant)

But maybe a better approach is to use a JOIN. Alternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to use a CTE that lists all case_ids in top variants, then join to event_log.

Alternatively, the subquery for case_ids can be written as:

SELECT case_id FROM case_sequences WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)

So the final event_log entries are those whose case_id is in that list.

So the subquery for case_id would be:

SELECT case_id
FROM case_sequences
WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)

Thus, the full query would look like this:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts_with_rank AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts_with_rank
    WHERE rank <= :K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    WHERE cs.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
)

Alternatively, using a CTE for the qualifying case_ids:

qualified_case_ids AS (
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    JOIN top_variants tv ON cs.variant = tv.variant
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN qualified_case_ids q ON e.case_id = q.case_id;

This might be more efficient, as the subquery in the IN clause could be rewritten with a join.

But perhaps the initial approach works. Now, I need to make sure that the variables are correctly referenced.

Wait, the variant_counts_with_rank computes the rank for each variant. The top_variants CTE selects the variants with rank <= K. Then, the case_ids that have a variant in the top_variants are the ones we need. 

Testing this logic: Let's say K=2. The variants with rank 1 and 2 are selected. The case_sequences has all case_id and their variants. The top_variants list the variants, so case_sequences.variant must be in that list. Then, the case_ids in those are the ones to include.

Yes, that should work.

Now, possible edge cases: if there are multiple variants with the same frequency. The row_number() function will assign a rank, so if two variants have the same count, they'll get different ranks. So the first would have rank 1, next rank 2, etc. But if K is 2, they are included. If K is 1, it's only the first. That's okay, the problem says "top K", so the rank function is appropriate here.

Another thing to consider: the string_agg function's order. Since the timestamp is ordered, the string_agg uses the timestamp order. The activities are ordered by timestamp, so the string_agg should correctly capture the process variant.

Now, the final query should return all events from the top K variants. 

Wait, but the problem requires the final result to include all events from the cases that belong to the top K variants. So the above approach should do that.

Now, putting this into code. The placeholder for K would be :K. In DuckDB, parameters can be used with named parameters, so in the query, it would be written as :K where K is a parameter. Since the user might need to input K, the user's query would have to replace that with an actual value.

Another point: the string_agg's delimiter is a comma. But if any of the activities have commas in their names, that could cause issues. However, the problem statement doesn't mention any such constraints, so assuming that activities are simple strings without commas, or that the delimiter is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe using a different delimiter like a pipe | or something. But the problem says to use the ordered sequence, so as long as the delimiter doesn't appear in the activity names, it's okay. Since it's a general solution, the user can adjust if needed, but the problem doesn't mention that, so proceed with comma.

Another possible optimization: the case_sequences CTE is needed twice? Once in the variant_counts_with_rank and then again in the top_variants. But since it's a CTE, it's computed once. So that's okay.

Wait, in the variant_counts_with_rank, the variant is from case_sequences. The CTE is computed once, so that's okay. The joins should work.

Now, putting all the CTEs together and the final SELECT.

Wait, in the final SELECT, the event_log is joined with case_sequences via case_id, but maybe it's better to just check that the case_id is in the list of qualifying case_ids. The current approach uses a subquery to get the qualifying case_ids. Alternatively, an EXISTS clause.

Alternatively, using a CTE for the qualified case_ids:

qualified_case_ids AS (
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    JOIN top_variants tv ON cs.variant = tv.variant
)

Then the final SELECT would be:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN qualified_case_ids q ON e.case_id = q.case_id;

This might be more efficient, since the CTE is computed once. Let me structure it that way.

Putting all together:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE rank <= :K
),
qualified_case_ids AS (
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    JOIN top_variants tv ON cs.variant = tv.variant
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM qualified_case_ids);

Hmm, that's another way. The variant_counts is the counts per variant. Then, ranked_variants assigns a rank to each variant based on frequency. Then top_variants has the variants with rank <= K. Then, qualified_case_ids are all case_ids whose variant is in top_variants. Then the final SELECT pulls those case_ids.

Alternatively, maybe the variant_counts can be integrated differently, but that structure might work.

Wait, in the first approach, the variant_counts_with_rank already combines the count and the rank in one step. Let me see:

Original variant_counts_with_rank was:

variant_counts_with_rank AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
)

Wait, in this case, the row_number() is computed over the ordered counts. That's correct. So that CTE can be written as:

variant_counts_with_rank is computed by first grouping by variant to get counts, then calculating the row number based on the count descending. Wait, but in the previous approach, the counts come first, so the CTE variant_counts_with_rank would have:

The first part: 

variant_counts_with_rank is a CTE that:

SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER ... 

Wait, perhaps to make it clearer:

First, group by variant to get the counts, then compute the row_number() over the ordered counts.

So, the CTEs can be structured as:

case_sequences (case_id, variant)

Then variant_counts (variant, count):

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
)

Then, ranked_variants assigns the rank:

ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, frequency, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rn
    FROM variant_counts
)

Then, top_variants is the variants with rn <= K.

Then, case_ids are the case_sequences where their variant is in that list.

Thus, the final query could be written as:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE rank <= :K
),
qualified_case_ids AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM qualified_case_ids);

Alternatively, using a JOIN chain. Let me check if this structure works.

Another possible issue: if K is 0 or a negative number, but the problem probably assumes K is a positive integer. The user is to write the query, so assuming K is a positive integer.

Another thing to consider: if there are multiple rows with the same frequency, row_number will assign them different ranks. For example, if two variants have the same count, the first one gets rank 1, the second rank 2, so even if they have same count, they are ordered by their order in the row_number's window. The window's ORDER BY is only on frequency DESC, so if two variants have same count, their rank depends on the tiebreaker. But the problem doesn't specify how to handle ties, so the row_number will arbitrarily choose an order between them, but the problem probably expects that as per the problem's requirements. 

Alternatively, maybe using DENSE_RANK() instead of ROW_NUMBER? The problem says "top K by frequency", so if two variants have the same count as the K-th variant, they might both be included. But the problem says "top K", which can be ambiguous. However, using ROW_NUMBER would select exactly K rows, whereas DENSE_RANK could include more if there are ties. But the question says "top K variants by their frequency", so it's ambiguous, but the problem probably expects the row_number approach, as per the standard interpretation of "top K".

Therefore, using row_number is appropriate here.

Now, putting this all together into the final query.

Another possible optimization: in the qualified_case_ids, instead of using a subquery, perhaps use a join. Let's see:

The qualified_case_ids is the set of case_ids where their variant is in the top_variants. So, the query can be written as:

SELECT e.* 
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
JOIN top_variants tv ON cs.variant = tv.variant;

Wait, but top_variants only has the variants, so:

Actually, the top_variants has variant column. So:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)

Alternatively, the JOIN approach would be:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
JOIN ranked_variants rv ON cs.variant = rv.variant
WHERE rv.rank <= :K

Hmm, maybe that way avoids subqueries in the WHERE clause, which could be more efficient. Let me think:

Alternatively, here's a revised CTE approach:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE rank <= :K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    WHERE cs.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
);

Alternatively, using joins:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.variant IN (
    SELECT variant FROM top_variants
);

This might be more efficient, as it avoids subqueries in the WHERE clause.

Putting that into the CTEs:

The final query would be written as:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rn
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE rn <= :K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants);

Wait, but to join case_sequences with the event_log, since each case's variant is stored in case_sequences, then to get the case_ids that have their variant in top_variants. So the above query would do that.

Alternatively, the join between e and case_sequences is necessary because we can't directly reference case_sequences.variant in the WHERE clause of the event_log's SELECT, but by joining with case_sequences, we can filter based on the variant.

Wait, but case_sequences already includes all case_ids and their variants. So for each event in event_log, its case_id is in case_sequences (since every case_id is in case_sequences), so the join is safe.

Therefore, the final SELECT would be:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants);

Yes, this way, it ensures that for each event's case_id, the variant is in the top variants.

Alternatively, the subquery for top_variants can be written as a CTE, so the IN clause can reference it.

Testing this structure, the steps seem correct.

Now, the final query structure is as follows:

The final SELECT uses the event_log joined to case_sequences to get the variant for each case, then checks if that variant is in the top_variants. This will effectively filter the event_log to only those case_ids.

Now, putting all CTEs together with the correct syntax.

Now, in the problem's required steps, the user needs to ensure that they correctly extract the ordered sequence, which the string_agg with order by timestamp does.

Now, another possible issue is handling the case where a case has only one activity. The string_agg would just be that single activity, which is correct.

Now, in DuckDB, the string_agg function is available as string_agg? Or is it listagg? Wait, DuckDB's documentation says that array_agg and listagg are available. Let me confirm: DuckDB has listagg, which is similar to string_agg. Wait, checking DuckDB's documentation: DuckDB has the listagg function, which is used for concatenating strings with a separator. The syntax is listagg(expression, delimiter, [ORDER BY ...]). 

Wait, looking up DuckDB's string functions: 

The correct function is listagg. The syntax would be:

listagg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp)

Wait, the syntax for listagg in DuckDB is:

listagg([DISTINCT] expression, delimiter] [ORDER BY ...])

So the correct syntax would be:

string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) ?

Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact function name. The correct function for creating the sequence is listagg? Let me confirm.

Looking up DuckDB's documentation:

Yes, DuckDB has a listagg function. The syntax would be:

listagg(activity, ',', 'ORDER BY timestamp')

Wait, the function's parameters are: listagg([DISTINCT] expression, delimiter, [ORDER BY ...])

Wait, the order by is part of the listagg's parameters. The syntax is:

listagg(activity, ',', 'ORDER BY timestamp') 

Wait, no. Let me check DuckDB's documentation for listagg:

The listagg function in DuckDB is used as:

LISTAGG ( [ DISTINCT ] expression, delimiter [ ORDER BY order_expression [ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS FIRST | LAST ] [ , ... ] ) [ WITHIN ( ... ) ]

Wait, the exact syntax might be:

listagg(activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp) 

Wait, perhaps:

listagg(activity, ',', ORDER By timestamp) ?

Wait, maybe the correct syntax is:

listagg(activity, ',' ORDER By timestamp) 

Wait, perhaps the order_by clause is inside the listagg function.

Alternatively, perhaps in DuckDB, the syntax is:

listagg(activity, ',', 'ORDER BY timestamp')

Wait, the exact syntax might be:

listagg(activity, ',', 'ORDER BY timestamp') 

Alternatively, maybe the ORDER BY is part of the function's parameters. Let me look up an example:

According to DuckDB documentation, the listagg function can have the order by clause as part of the function's arguments. The correct syntax is:

listagg(activity, ',', 'ORDER BY timestamp')

Wait, here's an example from DuckDB's docs:

SELECT listagg(name, ', ', 'ORDER BY id') FROM table;

Wait, so the syntax is listagg( expr, delimiter, [ORDER BY ...])

Wait, the correct syntax is:

listagg( activity, ',', 'ORDER BY timestamp' )

Wait, the third argument is the delimiter, and the order by is specified in the parameters. Wait, no, perhaps the function is called as:

listagg( activity, ',', ORDER by timestamp )

Wait, perhaps:

listagg( activity, ',', order by timestamp )

Wait, maybe the order by is part of the function's clause. Let me see an example.

Wait, according to the DuckDB documentation for listagg:

The function is:

LISTAGG( [ DISTINCT ] expression, delimiter [ ORDER BY ... ] )

Wait, perhaps the correct syntax is:

listagg(activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp)

Wait, maybe the correct syntax is:

listagg(activity, ',', ORDER By timestamp) 

So the first argument is the column to aggregate, the second is the delimiter, and the third is the order by clause inside the listagg function.

Wait, here's an example from DuckDB's documentation (assuming that they have an example):

Okay, putting it all together. Let me write the final query step by step.

The final SQL query would look like this:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           LISTAGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, frequency, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE rank <= :K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants);

Wait, that's possible. Alternatively, using CTEs to make it clearer.

Wait, in the case_sequences, the LISTAGG function is used with ORDER BY timestamp. That should correctly order the activities by their timestamp, so the variant is the correct sequence.

Now, the final query would have the event_log joined with case_sequences to get the variant for each case, then filter those where the variant is in the top variants.

Alternatively, the final SELECT can be written as:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id 
    FROM case_sequences cs
    WHERE cs.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
);

This might be more efficient because it avoids joining the entire event_log with case_sequences again, but it might require a correlated subquery. Alternatively, using the JOIN approach might be better.

Wait, the first approach with the JOIN on case_sequences ensures that each case's variant is known, so it can filter the case_ids properly.

Now, testing this approach:

Yes, this should work.

Now, putting all the CTEs together with the correct syntax. Let me ensure the syntax for LISTAGG is correct. Assuming that DuckDB uses LISTAGG with the order clause inside. Let me check the exact syntax.

Wait, in DuckDB's documentation, the LISTAGG function is used as:

LISTAGG( [DISTINCT] expression, delimiter, [ORDER BY ...] )

So the syntax should be:

LISTAGG( activity, ',', ORDER By timestamp )

Therefore, the case_sequences CTE:

SELECT case_id, 
       LISTAGG(activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id

Wait, but the syntax might actually be:

LISTAGG( activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp )

Wait, perhaps the correct syntax is:

LISTAGG(activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp)

Wait, maybe the correct syntax is:

LISTAGG(activity, ',', 'ORDER BY timestamp') 

Wait, maybe the order_by clause is a third argument? Let me think of the DuckDB documentation example:

According to the DuckDB documentation (https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/aggregation_functions/listagg.html), the syntax is:

LISTAGG ( [ DISTINCT ] expression, delimiter [ ORDER BY ... ] [ NULLS FIRST | LAST ] )

So the correct syntax would be:

LISTAGG(activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp)

Wait, the delimiter comes after the expression, and then the ORDER BY is part of the function's parameters.

Thus, the correct syntax for the case_sequences is:

SELECT case_id, 
       LISTAGG(activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id

Wait, but the comma is the delimiter. The syntax is:

LISTAGG(expression, delimiter [ , ... ]) ?

Wait, the function's parameters are the expression, then the delimiter, then the ORDER BY clause.

Wait, perhaps the correct syntax is:

LISTAGG(activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp)

Yes, according to the example here: https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/aggregation_functions/listagg.html#syntax

Example:

SELECT department, LISTAGG(name, ',', 'ORDER BY name') FROM employees GROUP BY department;

So the order by is part of the third parameter? Wait, in the example, it's written as:

LISTAGG(name, ',', 'ORDER BY name'

Wait, in the example, the function is called as:

LISTAGG( name, ',', 'ORDER BY name' )

Ah, the third parameter is the ORDER BY clause as a string? Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the syntax is:

The function is called with the delimiter and the order by clause as parameters. Wait, perhaps the syntax is:

LISTAGG ( [ DISTINCT ] expression , delimiter_string [ , ORDER BY ... ] )

Wait in the example given in the documentation:

SELECT department, LISTAGG(name, ',', 'ORDER BY name') FROM employees GROUP BY department;

So the third argument is the ORDER BY clause as a string. Wait, but that seems odd. Wait, the example shows the third parameter is 'ORDER BY name', which is a string. That can't be right. Maybe it's a syntax error in the documentation? Or perhaps the syntax is that the ORDER BY is a separate clause. Wait, perhaps the syntax allows an ORDER BY clause as part of the function.

Alternatively, the correct syntax is:

LISTAGG( activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp )

Which would be the correct way: the delimiter is the second argument, and the ORDER BY is a clause following that.

Wait, the documentation example may have a typo, but assuming that in DuckDB, the syntax is:

LISTAGG ( expression , delimiter ORDER BY ... )

Therefore, the correct syntax would be:

LISTAGG(activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp) 

Therefore, the case_sequences CTE would be:

SELECT case_id, 
       LISTAGG(activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id;

That should work.

Putting all together:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, 
           LISTAGG(activity, ',', ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, frequency,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE rank <= :K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants);

Wait, but in the case_sequences, variant is the ordered list of activities. 

This should work.

Now, testing this query step by step.

First CTE: case_sequences creates the variant for each case_id.

Second: counts per variant.
