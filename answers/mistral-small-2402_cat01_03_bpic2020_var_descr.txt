This process represents a multi-step approval workflow for employee declarations leading to payment handling. The process begins when an employee submits a declaration. The declaration then goes through various approval stages, which can include approval by an administrator, a budget owner, a pre-approver, and/or a supervisor.

In some cases, the declaration may be rejected at any of these stages, requiring the employee to make corrections and resubmit the declaration. The process may involve multiple rejections and resubmissions before final approval is granted.

Once the declaration is finally approved, a payment request is initiated, and ultimately, the payment is handled. The frequency and performance metrics provided for each process variant suggest the volume of that particular process variant and the average time taken for each process variant to complete, respectively.
