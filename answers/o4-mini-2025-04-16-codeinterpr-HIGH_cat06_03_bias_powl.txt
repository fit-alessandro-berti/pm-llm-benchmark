In the model you sketched, the XORbranch  
```  
     C   xor_local_check  E  
                    
          D         skip  
```  
means that some applications go through an extra “local affiliation” check (D) and others do not.  On the face of it, that is just a small routing choice, but in practice it introduces a systematic—and almost invisible—advantage for anyone who happens to live “locally.”

1.   How the bias creeps in  
     •   **Additional uplift path**  
         If an applicant is identified as a member of the “local community,” they trigger task D, where the underwriter can give them a subtle goodwill or “we know you” score boost before manual review (E).  
     •   **Skip for everyone else**  
         All nonlocals bypass that goodwill boost.  They go straight to the same manual review, but without the prior positive nudge.  

2.   Why it matters—even though “local” isn’t a protected class  
     •   **Nonprotected doesn’t mean harmless**  
         “Local resident” isn’t one of the legally protected categories (race, gender, religion, etc.), so you won’t trip a classic “disparatetreatment” violation.  But you *are* granting an unearned procedural advantage to one group and denying it to everyone else.  
     •   **Correlations can bite you**  
         Geography often correlates with income, race, age, or other protected attributes.  By favoring “locals,” you may unintentionally inflate approval rates for, say, wealthier suburban neighborhoods or one ethnic enclave, triggering a disparate *impact* claim.  

3.   Fairness and equity implications  
     •   **Groupfairness erosion**  
         If you measure approval rates by “local” vs. “nonlocal,” you will almost certainly see higher approval, better terms, or faster turnaround for locals.  That violates any demographicparity or equalopportunity criterion you care about.  
     •   **Undermining trust**  
         Applicants expect that they’re being judged on their creditworthiness, not on an arbitrary addressbased “bonus.”  Hidden routing rules like this can become a reputational risk if they ever surface.  
     •   **Creeping scope of “legitimate business need”**  
         It’s easy to defend a “local check” as a workflowefficiency hack or a “know-your-community” step.  But once you allow that, where do you draw the line?  Might you someday add affinity-club checks, alma-mater checks, church-membership checks…?  

4.   Recommendations for remediation  
     1.  **Eliminate the branch**  
         If there is no strong, objective, and documented business or regulatory need for a “local check,” remove the XOR and treat everyone the same.  
     2.  **Merge it into your formal score**  
         If you really believe “local affiliation” is predictive of repayment, fold it into your statistical scoring model, test it for fairness (e.g., check for correlations with protected attributes), and make it transparent in your credit policy.  
     3.  **Audit and monitor**  
         Once you have any kind of branching, log who went where, track approval rates, term quality, default rates by group (local vs. non-local and by protected class), and set alerts when disparities exceed your thresholds.  
     4.  **Document justification**  
         If the step remains, have a written, data-driven business case showing that it improves predictive power without causing illegal disparate impact.  

In short, even though “local affiliation” is not a legally protected characteristic, giving locals a hidden process advantage is a textbook case of unfairness by process design.  It erodes group-fairness, can create unintended disparate impact, and undermines transparency.  Best practice is either to remove that path entirely or to elevate it into a formally tested, monitored, and transparent part of your scoring model.
