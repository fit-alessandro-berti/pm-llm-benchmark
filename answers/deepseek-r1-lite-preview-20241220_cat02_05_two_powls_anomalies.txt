### Analysis of POWL Models for the "Hire-to-Retire" Process

#### Standard "Hire-to-Retire" Process Overview:
1. **Post_Job_Ad**
2. **Screen_Candidates**
3. **Conduct_Interviews**
4. **Make_Hiring_Decision**
5. **Onboard_Employee**
6. **Add_to_Payroll**
7. **Close_Case**

#### Model 1 Analysis:
- **Activities and Order:**
  - Post_Job_Ad → Screen_Candidates
  - Screen_Candidates → Make_Hiring_Decision
  - Screen_Candidates → Conduct_Interviews
  - Make_Hiring_Decision → Onboard_Employee
  - Onboard_Employee → Add_to_Payroll
  - Add_to_Payroll → Close_Case

- **Anomalies Identified:**
  - **Incorrect Ordering Between Interview and Decision:**
    - In Model 1, Screen_Candidates connects directly to both Make_Hiring_Decision and Conduct_Interviews without enforcing an order. Typically, interviews should precede the decision.
  - **Parallel Execution Implied:**
    - The model allows Conduct_Interviews and Make_Hiring_Decision to be initiated from Screen_Candidates without specifying that interviews should occur before the decision is made.

#### Model 2 Analysis:
- **Activities and Operators:**
  - Post_Job_Ad
  - Screen_Candidates
  - Conduct_Interviews
  - Make_Hiring_Decision
  - Loop on Onboard_Employee with a silent transition
  - XOR choice between Add_to_Payroll and a silent transition
  - Close_Case

- **Ordering:**
  - Post_Job_Ad → Screen_Candidates
  - Post_Job_Ad → Conduct_Interviews
  - Conduct_Interviews → Make_Hiring_Decision
  - Make_Hiring_Decision → loop_onboarding (Onboard_Employee and silent transition)
  - loop_onboarding → xor_payroll (Add_to_Payroll and silent transition)
  - xor_payroll → Close_Case

- **Anomalies Identified:**
  - **Simultaneous Screening and Interviewing:**
    - Post_Job_Ad connects directly to both Screen_Candidates and Conduct_Interviews, implying they can happen in parallel, which is not typical.
  - **Loop on Onboarding:**
    - The loop on Onboard_Employee with a silent transition suggests that onboarding could be repeated or skipped, which doesn't align with standard procedures.
  - **XOR Choice on Payroll:**
    - The XOR choice between Add_to_Payroll and a silent transition introduces unnecessary complexity, as adding to payroll should be a mandatory step.

#### Conclusion:
- **Model 1 is closer to the normative Hire-to-Retire process.** 
  - Although it incorrectly allows parallel initiation of interviews and decision-making from screening, it maintains a more logical sequence from posting the job ad through to closing the case.
  - The anomalies in Model 1 are relatively minor compared to the significant deviations in Model 2, such as the parallel execution of screening and interviewing, the loop onboarding, and the optional payroll addition.

- **Model 2 introduces more severe deviations** from the standard process, with flawed initial activity ordering and unnecessary control flow complexities, making it less aligned with the expected process integrity.

**Recommendation:**
- Model 1 is preferable as it adheres more closely to the standard Hire-to-Retire process, despite the noted anomalies.
