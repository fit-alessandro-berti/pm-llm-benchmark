The first step is to figure out which cases have more than six events. That means counting the events per case and filtering out those with a count greater than six. A subquery is the cleanest way to do this—group by case_id, count the events, and keep only those with a count less than or equal to six.

Once we have that list of case IDs, the next step is to join it back to the original table so we can return all the events from those cases. A semi-join with `IN` is simple and efficient here.

Putting it together:

```sql
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

This way, only events from cases with six or fewer events in total are returned.
