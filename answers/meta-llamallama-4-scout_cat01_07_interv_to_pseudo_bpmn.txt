## BPMN-like Textual Process Model

### Overview

The following process model describes the invoice approval workflow based on interviews with key stakeholders.

### Process: Invoice Approval

#### Start Event
- **Invoice Receipt**: The process begins when an invoice is received, typically by email.

#### Step 1: Initial Validation (Performed by Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary)
- **Activity**: Check if the invoice is associated with a valid purchase order (PO) number.
- **Decision**:
  - **Valid PO**: If the invoice has a PO number, proceed to log it into the accounting system.
  - **Invalid PO**: If no PO number, send back to supplier requesting more details.

#### Step 2: Logging Invoice (Performed by Mary)
- **Activity**: Log the invoice into the accounting system.

#### Step 3: Confirmation of Goods/Services Receipt (Performed by Purchasing - Dan)
- **Task**: Verify that goods/services were received as per the PO.
- **Role**: Purchasing Officer (Dan)
- **Output**: Confirmation email to Accounts Payable.

#### Step 4: Matching Invoice Line Items (Performed by Mary)
- **Task**: Match invoice line items against the PO in the system.
- **Decision**:
  - **Match**: If match is successful, proceed to manager approval.
  - **Discrepancy**: If there’s a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items), email Purchasing for clarification.

#### Step 5: Clarification and Escalation (Optional)
- **Activity**: Resolve discrepancies.
- **Role**: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), and Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) if escalation is needed.
- **Decision**:
  - **Resolved**: If discrepancy is resolved, continue with the process.
  - **Unresolved**: If issue cannot be resolved easily, escalate to supervisor (Rita).

#### Step 6: Manager Approval
- **Task**: Review invoice details, PO, and confirmations.
- **Role**: Department Manager (Carlos)
- **Decision**:
  - **Approve**: If all details are correct and within budget, approve the invoice.
  - **Reject**: If there are concerns (e.g., large differences in total amount, unexpected items), request further investigation.

#### Step 7: Scheduling for Payment
- **Activity**: Schedule the invoice for payment.
- **Role**: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)

### Gateways and Decision Points

- **Gateway 1: Valid PO Check**
  - **Decision Criterion**: Does the invoice have a valid PO number?
  - **Outcome 1**: Yes, proceed with logging into the accounting system.
  - **Outcome 2**: No, request more details from the supplier.

- **Gateway 2: Invoice Matching**
  - **Decision Criterion**: Does the invoice match the PO details?
  - **Outcome 1**: Yes, proceed to manager approval.
  - **Outcome 2**: No, clarify discrepancies.

- **Gateway 3: Discrepancy Resolution**
  - **Decision Criterion**: Can discrepancies be resolved easily?
  - **Outcome 1**: Yes, continue with approval process.
  - **Outcome 2**: No, escalate to supervisor (Rita).

- **Gateway 4: Manager Approval**
  - **Decision Criterion**: Are all details correct and within budget?
  - **Outcome 1**: Yes, approve invoice.
  - **Outcome 2**: No, request further investigation or modifications.

### Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs

- **Invoice**: The primary document being processed.
- **Purchase Order (PO)**: The reference document for validating goods/services receipt and pricing.
- **Confirmation Email**: Sent by Purchasing to Accounts Payable.
- **Accounting System**: Used to track and manage invoices.

### Roles and Participants

- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**: Receives and logs invoices, matches invoices to POs, and resolves discrepancies.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**: Confirms goods/services receipt and verifies invoice details against PO.
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**: Approves or rejects invoices based on validation and budget checks.
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**: Handles exceptions, escalations, and communicates with suppliers.

### Exceptions and Variations

- **Missing PO Number**: Supplier is contacted for a revised invoice.
- **Discrepancies**: Invoices are put on hold and investigated further by the relevant parties.
- **Informal Contracts**: In cases where services were contracted informally, Accounts Payable may need to create a retrospective PO.

Process: Invoice Approval

  Sequence:
    1. Receive Invoice -> 2. Validate PO Number
    2. Validate PO Number:
      - Yes: Log Invoice -> 3. Send to Purchasing for Confirmation
      - No: Request Details from Supplier

    3. Send to Purchasing for Confirmation
      -> 4. Verify Receipt of Goods/Services
        - Yes: Match Invoice Line Items -> 5. Send to Manager for Approval
        - No: Clarify Discrepancies

    4. Verify Receipt:
      - Activity: Confirm receipt of goods/services
      - Role: Purchasing

     kontrast
    5. Manager Approval:
      - Role: Department Manager (Carlos)
      - Decision: Approve or Reject

    6. Post-Approval:
      - If approved, Schedule for Payment
      - If rejected, request modifications and re-submit

  Gateways:
    - Gateway 1: Valid PO Number Check
      - Decision: Valid PO -> Proceed; Invalid PO -> Request Details
    - Gateway 2: Discrepancy Resolution
      - Decision: Resolvable easily -> Continue; Needs Escalation -> Involve Supervisor (Rita)

  Roles:
    - Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary): Logs invoices, matches POs, and resolves discrepancies.
    - Purchasing Officer (Dan): Confirms receipt of goods/services and verifies invoice details.
    - Department Manager (Carlos): Approves or rejects invoices based on validation.
    - Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita): Handles exceptions and escalations.

  Artifacts:
    - Invoice
    - Purchase Order (PO)
    - Confirmation Email
    - Accounting System Records

  Exceptions:
    - Missing PO Number: Supplier is contacted for clarification.
    - Discrepancies: Emailed to Purchasing for resolution; if unresolved, escalated to Rita.
```

### Key Activities and Tasks

1. **Invoice Receipt and Initial Validation**: Check for valid PO number.
2. **Logging Invoice**: Enter into accounting system.
3. **Confirmation of Goods/Services Receipt**: Verify receipt with Purchasing.
4. **Invoice Matching**: Match invoice line items against PO.
5. **Discrepancy Resolution**: Resolve discrepancies via email or phone.
6. **Manager Approval**: Final review and approval.
7. **Payment Scheduling**: Prepare for payment run.

### Implementation Notes

- This process model aims to capture the essence of the invoice approval workflow based on stakeholder interviews.
- **Uncertainty**: In some cases, there might be variations in handling exceptions (e.g., informal contracts).
- **Assumptions**: The process assumes integration with an accounting system for tracking and managing invoices.

### Conversion to BPMN Diagram

To visualize this process, a BPMN diagram could include the following elements:

- **Pools**: Represent different departments (e.g., Accounts Payable, Purchasing, Department Management).
- **Events**: Start event (Invoice Receipt), End event (Payment Scheduled), and Intermediate events (e.g., Escalation to Supervisor).
- **Tasks**: Represent activities like logging invoices, confirming goods receipt, and approving/rejecting invoices.
- **Gateways**: Used for decision points (e.g., valid PO number check, discrepancy resolution).
- **Sequence Flows**: Indicate the flow of activities, from initial receipt to final payment scheduling.
- **Message Flows**: Indicate communication between roles/departments (e.g., confirmation emails).

This textual representation can be converted into a BPMN diagram by defining the activities, gateways, sequence flows, and roles involved in a structured graphical format.
