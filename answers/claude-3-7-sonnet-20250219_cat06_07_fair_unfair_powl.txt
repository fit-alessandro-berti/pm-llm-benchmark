# POWL Models for GlobalTeq Solutions Hiring Process

I'll create two POWL models for the GlobalTeq Solutions hiring process - one that includes the potential unfairness in the cultural fit evaluation, and one that removes this source of bias.

## Model 1: POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model includes an XOR branch that creates a potential bias by giving special treatment to applicants with certain community affiliations.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
standard_cultural_fit = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create the data completeness loop
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Create the XOR branch for cultural fit evaluation (potential bias point)
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[standard_cultural_fit, community_affiliation_check])

# Create the main process flow
hiring_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_application, 
    data_loop, 
    skill_assessment, 
    cultural_fit_xor, 
    managerial_review, 
    final_decision
])

# Define the order of execution
hiring_process.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_xor)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_xor, managerial_review)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

In this model, the potential unfairness is represented by the XOR branch `cultural_fit_xor` that allows applicants to either go through the standard cultural fit evaluation or the community affiliation check. The community affiliation check gives preferential treatment to applicants with certain local community affiliations or educational backgrounds, creating an unfair advantage.

## Model 2: POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model removes the biased XOR branch and ensures all applicants undergo the same evaluation process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create the data completeness loop
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Create the main process flow
fair_hiring_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_application, 
    data_loop, 
    skill_assessment, 
    cultural_fit_check, 
    managerial_review, 
    final_decision
])

# Define the order of execution
fair_hiring_process.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)
fair_hiring_process.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
fair_hiring_process.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check)
fair_hiring_process.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_check, managerial_review)
fair_hiring_process.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

In this fair model, I've removed the XOR branch that created the potential bias. Instead, all applicants go through the same standardized cultural fit check, ensuring that no one receives preferential treatment based on community affiliations or educational background. The process maintains the data completeness loop and the sequential ordering of tasks, but eliminates the source of unfairness.

## Key Differences Between the Models

1. **Biased Model**: Contains an XOR branch that allows some applicants to bypass the standard cultural fit check and instead go through a community affiliation check that gives them an advantage.

2. **Fair Model**: Removes the XOR branch and ensures all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process, eliminating the potential for bias based on community affiliations.

The fair model ensures that the hiring process is based solely on merit and relevant qualifications, rather than on factors that could introduce unfair advantages for certain groups of applicants.
