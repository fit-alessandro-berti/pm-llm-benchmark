Based on patient demographics, department flow and timing, we can clearly see three interleaved patient “cases.”  Assigning them Case A, B and C:

1. Case A (45-year-old male, ER, private insurance)  
   – Events:  
     • 1. 08:05:13 Register patient (ER)  
     • 4. 08:10:50 Initial triage (ER)  
     • 7. 08:15:42 X-ray imaging (Radiology)  
     • 12. 08:23:10 Doctor consultation (ER) – diagnosis hairline fracture  
     • 15. 08:30:05 Patient discharged (ER)  

2. Case B (62-year-old female, ER, public insurance)  
   – Events:  
     • 2. 08:07:02 Register patient (ER)  
     • 5. 08:12:29 Initial triage (ER)  
     • 8. 08:16:10 Lab test requested (ER)  
     • 10. 08:20:27 Lab test completed (Laboratory)  
     • 11. 08:22:54 Doctor consultation (ER) – diagnosis minor infection  
     • 14. 08:27:00 Prescription created (ER)  
     • 17. 08:35:29 Patient discharged (ER)  

3. Case C (28-year-old male, Surgery, private insurance)  
   – Events:  
     • 3. 08:07:15 Register patient (Surgery)  
     • 6. 08:13:00 Doctor consultation (Surgery) – scheduled knee surgery  
     • 9. 08:16:45 Surgery preparation (Surgery)  
     • 13. 08:25:19 Surgery performed (Surgery)  
     • 16. 08:31:37 Recovery room (Surgery)  
     • 18. 08:40:13 Patient discharged (Surgery)  

These groupings align on patient_age/gender, department paths, resources and logical timestamp ordering.
