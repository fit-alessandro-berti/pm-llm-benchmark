# **Data-Driven Optimization of Resource Assignment in TechSolve Solutions' IT Service Desk Using Process Mining**

## **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

### **Key Metrics for Analysis**
To evaluate resource behavior and assignment patterns, I would focus on the following metrics derived from the event log:

- **Workload Distribution:** 
  - *Agent-Level:* Tickets handled per agent (daily/weekly), average handling time (AHT) per agent.
  - *Tier-Level:* Distribution of ticket assignments across L1, L2, L3 to detect imbalance (e.g., L2 overload).
  
- **Activity Processing Times:** 
  - Time spent in each state (e.g., "Work L1 Start" to "Work L1 End") per agent/tier.
  - Escalation time (from ticket creation to L2 assignment) and reassignment delays.

- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1:** Percentage of L1-handled tickets closed without escalation (indicative of L1 skill gaps).

- **Ticket-to-Skill Matching:** 
  - Skill mismatch frequency (tickets requiring a different skill than an agent’s documented expertise).
  - Specialization effectiveness (are L3 agents frequently handling L2-level issues?).

- **Assignment Patterns:**
  - Manual vs. automated assignments (e.g., dispatcher vs. round-robin).
  - Social network analysis of handovers (who commonly escalates to whom?).

### **Process Mining Techniques**
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** Map handovers between agents (e.g., L1  L2  L3) to uncover recurrent escalation paths and bottlenecks.
- **Role Discovery:** Cluster agents based on actual task execution (e.g., do some L1 agents handle more complex issues than others?).
- **Conformance Checking:** Compare actual assignments against the intended logic (e.g., is round-robin truly balanced? Are skill-based rules followed?).
- **Performance Analysis:** Detect delays caused by reassignments (e.g., compare cases with 0 vs. 3+ reassignments).

### **Utilization of Agent Skills**
- **Skill Usage Heatmaps:** Visualize how often specific skills (e.g., "Networking-Firewall") are used versus how many agents possess them.
- **Wasted Expertise:** Identify cases where high-skilled agents (e.g., L3 DB-SQL) handle low-complexity tasks.
- **Gap Analysis:** Correlate skill shortages with assignment failures (e.g., P2 tickets stuck in queue due to no available "Security-IAM" specialist).

## **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

### **Pinpointing Key Problems**
1. **Skill Bottlenecks:** 
   - Example: High wait times for "Networking-Firewall" tickets due to only 2 L2 agents with that skill.
   - Metric: % of tickets delayed >1hr due to skill unavailability.

2. **Reassignment Overhead:**
   - Example: INC-1001 was reassigned from B12 to B15 due to incorrect L2 assignment.
   - Metric: Avg. delay per reassignment (~25–50 mins in log snippet).

3. **L1 Escalation Inefficiencies:**
   - Example: L1 agents escalate P3 "App-CRM" tickets despite basic troubleshooting skills.
   - Metric: % of escalations where L1 could have resolved (via historical success rate).

4. **Overloaded Agents:**
   - Example: Agent B12 handles multiple complex tickets while others are underutilized.
   - Metric: Workload imbalance score (standard deviation of tickets/agent).

5. **SLA Breach Correlation:**
   - Example: 60% of SLA breaches occur when tickets are reassigned 2 times.

### **Quantifying Impact**
- **Skill Mismatches:** 30% of reassignments due to incorrect skill assignment  avg. +45 min delay/ticket.
- **L1 Escalations:** Only 40% FCR rate  60% of P3 tickets unnecessarily escalated, adding ~1.5 hrs to resolution.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes**
1. **Flawed Assignment Rules:** 
   - Round-robin ignores skill matching (e.g., INC-1001 assigned to B12 instead of CRM expert).
2. **Outdated Skill Profiles:** 
   - Agents trained in new skills (e.g., "Security-IAM") not reflected in system.
3. **Poor Ticket Triage:** 
   - L1/dispatchers misclassify "Networking" vs. "Security" tickets.
4. **Lack of Workload Awareness:** 
   - No real-time tracking of agent capacity (e.g., B12 overburdened).
5. **L1 Training Gaps:** 
   - L1 lacks CRM troubleshooting skills, leading to avoidable escalations.

### **Process Mining Insights**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare cases with smooth resolution (1 assignment) vs. chaotic (3+ reassignments). Differences may include:
  - Correct vs. incorrect initial categorization.
  - Availability of high-proficiency agents.
- **Decision Mining:** Train a model to predict escalation likelihood based on ticket/agent attributes (e.g., P2 + "Firewall"  80% chance of escalation).

## **4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting**
- **Issue Addressed:** Skill mismatches in assignments.
- **Implementation:** 
  - Assign tickets to agents with the highest skill match (e.g., "App-CRM"  agents with CRM experience).
  - Weight by proficiency (e.g., L2 > L1 for same skill).
- **Data Needed:** Agent skill matrix with proficiency levels.
- **Expected Benefit:** 30% reduction in reassignments, faster resolution.

### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**
- **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution.
- **Implementation:** 
  - Prioritize agents with shortest queue + required skills.
  - Dynamic thresholds (e.g., max 5 active tickets/agent).
- **Data Needed:** Real-time agent workload and availability.
- **Expected Benefit:** 20% improvement in SLA compliance for P2/P3.

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Ticket-Skill Mapping (AI Tags)**
- **Issue Addressed:** Poor initial categorization.
- **Implementation:** 
  - NLP on ticket descriptions to auto-tag required skills (e.g., "SQL error"  "DB-SQL").
  - Route to matching agents at creation.
- **Data Needed:** Historical ticket text and resolution paths.
- **Expected Benefit:** 40% fewer misclassified tickets.

## **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

### **Pre-Implementation Simulation**
- Use **process simulation** (e.g., BIMP) to model:
  - Current vs. proposed assignment rules.
  - Impact on SLA compliance under peak loads.
- Test scenarios: 20% increase in "Security" tickets, L2 skill shortages.

### **Post-Implementation Monitoring**
- **Dashboard KPIs:**
  - Reassignment rate (%) by tier.
  - SLA adherence by priority/tier.
  - Agent utilization (busy vs. idle time).
- **Process Views:**
  - Real-time assignment flow map.
  - Escalation path heatmaps.
- **Continuous Improvement:** 
  - Monthly skill-gap analysis.
  - A/B testing of new routing rules.
