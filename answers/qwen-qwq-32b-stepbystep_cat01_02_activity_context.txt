Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given me an event log from a financial services company's support workflow, and I need to rename activities that occur multiple times in the same case to better reflect their context. 

First, I'll start by looking at the event log provided. Let me read through each case carefully.

Looking at Case C001:
- The first instance of "Verify Documents" is right after the customer initiates the request. The context here is checking identity documents. The second "Verify Documents" happens after the customer submitted additional documents. The Additional Context mentions that the agent is re-checking the documents now that the ID scan is provided. So, the first verification is an initial check, and the second is a re-check. 

Then there's "Call Customer" which happens once in C001. But looking at other cases, like C002 and C003, there are multiple calls. Wait, actually in C001, "Call Customer" is only once. But in C002 and C003, there are multiple instances. Let me check all cases again.

Looking at Case C002:
- The first "Verify Documents" is part of identity verification. Then there's "Adjust Account" followed by two instances of "Call Customer". The first call is to clarify a discrepancy, the second is a follow-up to confirm adjustments. The second call is a follow-up, so maybe they can be distinguished as Initial Call and Follow-up Call?

Case C003 has two "Verify Documents" as well. The first is physical verification of ID, then after an adjustment, they re-verify. So similar to C001's structure.

Also, "Adjust Account" appears in C002 and C003. Is that only once each? Let me see. C002 has one, C003 has one. So maybe "Adjust Account" doesn't need renaming, but the repeated activities like "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer" do.

Now, the task is to rename activities that repeat within the same case. Let's list the activities and their instances:

Activities that repeat within a case:
- Verify Documents appears twice in C001, C002 has only once? Wait, no. Looking again:
Wait, C001 has two "Verify Documents" entries? Wait, C001's log shows "Verify Documents" at 09:20 and then again at 10:30. Yes, two times. C002 has only one "Verify Documents". Wait, no, looking at C002's log: the first activity after Initiate is Verify Documents, then later another Verify is not there. Wait, C002's activities are:

C002 has:
- Verify Documents (initial)
- Call Customer (to clarify discrepancy)
- Adjust Account
- Call Customer (follow-up)
- Approve.

Wait, so in C002, "Verify Documents" is only once. Wait no, looking at the data:

Looking at C002's log in the table:

C002's Activities:
- Initiate Request
- Verify Documents (identity verification)
- Call Customer (clarify discrepancy)
- Adjust Account
- Call Customer (follow-up)
- Approve

So only one Verify Documents there. Then in C003, there are two "Verify Documents": first at 11:25 (physical verification), then again at 12:20 after the Adjust Account. So C003 has two Verifies.

Similarly, "Call Customer" in C002 occurs twice, so those need to be renamed. In C003, there's one Call Customer, but in C001, only one. Wait, C003 has one Call Customer. Wait, let me check:

C003's activities:
- Initiate Request
- Verify Documents (physical)
- Call Customer (customer stepped out)
- Adjust Account
- Verify Documents (re-verify)
- Approve.

So the second Call Customer is in C002 (twice) and C001 has one. Wait, in C001, the Call Customer is because the verification was incomplete, then after the customer submits more docs, the agent re-verifies. Then approves.

So the activities that repeat within a case are:

1. "Verify Documents" in cases C001 and C003 (twice each).
2. "Call Customer" in C002 (twice).

Additionally, in C003, "Adjust Account" is once, so no problem there.

So for each of these repeated activities, I need to find a way to rename them to show their different contexts.

Starting with "Verify Documents" in C001:

First occurrence: "Verify Documents" at 09:20 is the initial check. The second at 10:30 is after the customer submitted more documents. So perhaps "Initial Document Verification" and "Re-Verification of Documents" or similar.

In C003, the first "Verify Documents" is physical verification (since it's a walk-in customer), and the second is after adjusting the account. Wait, the context says for the first in C003: "Physical verification of ID". The second is "Re-verify docs after account adjustment". So maybe "Initial Physical Verification" and "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification".

Next, the "Call Customer" in C002 has two instances. The first call is to clarify an account discrepancy, the second is to confirm adjustments. So maybe "Initial Clarification Call" and "Follow-Up Confirmation Call".

Also, in C003, the "Call Customer" is because the customer stepped out. The context says "Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return." So maybe "Customer Recall for Presence" or something like that. Wait, but since it's only once in C003, maybe we don't need to rename it unless there's another instance. Since it's only one, perhaps it's just "Call Customer to Recall Presence" or "Request Customer Return Call".

Wait, but in C002, the two calls are different purposes, so they need different names. Let me note down all the instances:

For "Verify Documents":
- C001 has two: first is initial check, second after submission of missing docs.
- C003 has two: first physical verification, second after adjustment.

So for C001, the first could be "Initial Document Verification" and the second "Re-Verification of Documents".

Alternatively, maybe "Initial Document Verification" and "Follow-Up Document Verification".

In C003's first is physical, so "Initial Physical Document Verification", and the second "Post-Adjustment Document Verification".

Alternatively, maybe use "Initial" and "Recheck" or "Re-Verification".

For "Call Customer" in C002:
- First: "Call Customer to Clarify Discrepancy"
- Second: "Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustments"

Alternatively, "Outbound Clarification Call" and "Follow-Up Confirmation Call".

Now, looking at the "Call Customer" in C003: the context says the customer stepped out, so maybe "Call to Recall Customer".

Now, are there any other activities that repeat? Let me check.

Looking at "Adjust Account" only occurs once in each case where it's present, so no need to rename those.

So the main ones are the Verifies and Calls.

Now, check each case's instances:

Case C001:
- Verify Documents (1) and (2)
- Only one Call.

Case C002:
- Two Calls.

Case C003:
- Two Verifies and one Call.

So the renaming needs to be consistent across all cases where the activity repeats. So the names must be such that in any case where an activity repeats, their new names distinguish their context.

Now, the user's instruction says to "rename the activities so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences".

So, for "Verify Documents", wherever it appears twice in a case, the first is initial, the second re-verification. But in cases where it's only once, it can stay as is or use the more specific name, but since the task is to rename all instances where they're repeated in a case, perhaps even in C003, the two Verifies should be renamed to Initial and Re-Verification, even if the context mentions physical in the first and post-adjustment in the second.

Wait, but the context in C003's first Verify is physical verification (since it's a walk-in). The second is after an account adjustment. So maybe the first is "Initial Physical Document Verification", and the second "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification".

Alternatively, to make it consistent across all cases, perhaps:

Each time "Verify Documents" is first, it's "Initial Document Verification", and the second is "Follow-Up Document Verification" or "Re-Verification of Documents".

Similarly, for the Calls in C002:

First call in C002: "Call Customer for Clarification" and the second "Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustments".

Alternatively, more descriptive names based on the context's Additional Context.

Looking at the Additional Context for each occurrence:

For C001's first Verify: "Agent checks identity documents."
Second Verify: "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided."

So the first is Initial, then Re-Check.

In C003's Verifies:

First: "Physical verification of ID."
Second: "Re-verify docs after account adjustment."

So in C003's first is Initial (physical), second is post-adjustment.

Therefore, for "Verify Documents", the first occurrence in any case would be "Initial Document Verification", and the second would be "Re-Verification of Documents" or "Post-Submission Document Check" or something indicating it's after a submission.

Alternatively, use the context's own phrases. The second in C001 is "re-checks", so "Re-Check Documents" maybe. But we need to make it clear.

For the Calls in C002:

First Call: "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs." – Wait, no, the first Call in C001 is: "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs." Wait, no, C001's Call Customer is described as "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs."

Wait, looking at each case's Additional Context:

Looking at each activity's Additional Context:

C001:
- First Verify: "Agent checks identity documents."
- The Call: "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs."
- Then Submit Additional (customer adds docs)
- Second Verify: "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided."

So in C001, the first Verify is initial, second is after submission of additional docs.

In C003's second Verify: "Re-verify docs after account adjustment."

So the common pattern for "Verify Documents" is that the second occurrence is after some action (submitting more docs or an adjustment). So they are re-verifications.

So perhaps:

In all cases where "Verify Documents" occurs more than once, the first is "Initial Document Verification" and the second "Re-Verification of Documents". Alternatively, in C003's second is after an Adjust Account, so maybe "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification".

Alternatively, to make it general, for any second Verification, it's a Re-Verification.

For the Calls in C002:

First Call: "Clarify account discrepancy."
Second Call: "Follow-up to confirm adjustments."

So first could be "Outbound Clarification Call", second "Follow-Up Confirmation Call".

In C001's Call is to request missing docs, so maybe "Request Missing Documents Call" or "Call to Request Missing Docs".

Similarly, C003's Call is to recall the customer who stepped out: "Call to Recall Customer".

Now, I need to apply this systematically.

Let me go case by case and note the new names.

Case C001:

Activities:

1. Initiate Request
2. Verify Documents (first)  "Initial Document Verification"
3. Call Customer  "Call to Request Missing Docs" (since the additional context says Verification incomplete, so call to get missing docs.
4. Submit Additional
5. Verify Documents (second)  "Re-Verification of Documents"
6. Approve.

Case C002:

1. Initiate
2. Verify Documents  only once, so no need to rename, but in the problem statement, the task is to rename only those that repeat in the same case. Since C002 has only one Verify, it stays as is.

3. Call Customer (first)  "Call for Discrepancy Clarification"
4. Adjust Account
5. Call Customer (second)  "Follow-Up Call for Adjustment Confirmation"
6. Approve.

Case C003:

1. Initiate
2. Verify Documents (first)  "Initial Physical Document Verification" (since it's physical)
3. Call Customer  "Call to Recall Customer Presence" (since the customer stepped out)
4. Adjust Account
5. Verify Documents (second)  "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification"
6. Approve.

Now, but need to make sure that the new names are consistent across all instances. For example, in C001's second Verify, it's after a submission of more docs, so maybe "Post-Submission Document Re-Verification".

Alternatively, use "Re-Verification of Documents" for all second Verifies.

Similarly, for the Calls in C002, first is about clarification, second is follow-up.

Another point to consider: in C003's first Verify, the context mentions "Physical verification of ID". So maybe "Initial Physical Document Verification" is better.

Alternatively, "Initial ID Verification" but need to ensure that's clear.

Alternatively, maybe "Initial Document Verification (Physical)" but maybe too long.

Alternatively, use "Initial Verification" and "Re-Verification" as the main terms, with the context in the name.

Alternatively, the first could be "Initial Document Verification" in all cases where it's the first occurrence, and the second as "Re-Verification".

But in C003's second Verify, it's after an account adjustment, so maybe "Post-Adjustment Re-Verification".

But perhaps the key is to use the context's specific reason each time.

Alternatively, for the second Verify in C003, since it's after adjusting the account, perhaps "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification".

But perhaps the most consistent way is to use the order and context. Let's structure the new names as follows:

For "Verify Documents":

- First occurrence: "Initial Document Verification"
- Second occurrence: "Re-Verification of Documents"

But in C001's second Verify, the Additional Context says "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided." So maybe "Re-Verification After Submission".

Alternatively, in C003's second Verify: "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification".

Hmm, maybe the names should be specific to their context.

Alternatively, each instance's name can incorporate the reason.

Alternatively, perhaps:

In C001:

First Verify: "Initial Identity Verification" (since it's about checking identity docs)

Second Verify: "Re-Verification with Submitted ID Scan"

But that might be too specific.

Alternatively, the key is to have the names reflect their position in the process. The first is initial, the second is a follow-up.

Alternatively, the problem might require that wherever the same activity name repeats in a case, they get distinct names.

The problem says "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case, but carry different contextual meanings depending on when and how they occur. Your task is to rename so that their names reflect the differences.

So for each occurrence in a case where the activity repeats, the name must change.

So for "Verify Documents" in C001 and C003 (each has two instances), need to rename both instances in each case.

Same for "Call Customer" in C002 (two instances).

For the first Verify in C001: the context is "checks identity documents"  maybe "Initial Identity Verification"

Second Verify in C001: "re-checks documents after ID submission"  "Reverification After ID Submission"

Alternatively, "Post-Submission Document Re-Verification".

For C003's Verifies:

First: "Physical Verification of ID" (since it's physical, mentioned in context).

Second: "Post-Adjustment Re-Verification".

Alternatively, in C003's first Verify, since it's part of the initial process, "Initial Physical Verification" and "Re-Verification After Adjustment".

Alternatively, maybe "Initial Document Verification" and "Follow-Up Verification".

But the key is to ensure that within a case, each occurrence of the activity has a distinct name that captures their context.

Another angle: The first "Verify Documents" is part of the initial process, while the second is after some action (submitting docs or adjustment). So the names can be "Initial Document Verification" and "Re-Verification of Documents".

Alternatively, using the Additional Context's key points:

C001's second Verify has "re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided"  "Re-Verification with Submitted ID"

C003's second Verify: "Re-verify docs after account adjustment"  "Post-Adjustment Re-Verification".

Alternatively, to keep it consistent, perhaps:

For "Verify Documents":

- First occurrence: "Initial Document Verification"

- Second: "Re-Verification of Documents" (with maybe a suffix if needed, but perhaps just that name suffices if the context is covered.

Wait, but the problem requires that the new names must disambiguate their contextual differences. So in C001, the two Verifies must have different names. The second is after the customer submitted more docs, so "Re-Verification After Submission".

But perhaps the first is "Initial Document Verification", second is "Re-Verification of Documents".

But maybe the second one's name can include "Re-Verification" to indicate it's a follow-up.

Alternatively, in C002's Calls, the two Calls:

First: "Call Customer" with context "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy."  "Call to Clarify Discrepancy"

Second: "Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustments".

So for the first occurrence in a case, use the first's context, and the second's context for the second.

Now, to formalize:

For each case where an activity is repeated, rename each instance with a name that reflects their specific role.

Let me proceed step by step for each case and each repeated activity.

Starting with "Verify Documents" in C001:

Case C001:

- First Verify: "Verify Documents (1)  "Initial Document Verification"

- Second Verify: "Re-Verification of Documents"

Case C003:

- First Verify: "Initial Physical Document Verification"

- Second Verify: "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification"

But maybe the second in C003 is after an account adjustment, so that's a different context than in C001's second Verify (which was after submitting more docs). So each case's Verifies need to have names specific to their context.

Alternatively, use the Additional Context's first sentence to form the new name.

For example:

C001's first Verify: "Identity Document Verification"

Second Verify: "Post-Submission ID Re-Verification"

C003's first Verify: "Physical ID Verification"

Second: "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification"

Alternatively, perhaps:

For the first Verify in C001: since the context is checking identity, "Initial Identity Verification".

Second: "Re-Verification Following Submission".

Alternatively, to make it clear, perhaps for the second Verify in C001, the name could be "Re-Verification After Additional Submission".

But the problem wants the new names to "clearly reflect their contextual differences".

Alternatively, in C001:

First Verify: "Identity Document Verification"

Second: "Re-Verification with Submitted ID"

In C003's Verifies:

First: "Initial Physical Document Verification"

Second: "Post-Adjustment Re-Verification"

Alternatively, maybe the first is "Initial Verification" and "Re-Verification" in all cases, but that might not capture the context. The problem might want more descriptive names.

Alternatively, for the first Verify in C001:

"Initial Document Verification"

Second: "Re-Verification of ID Documents"

In C003's second Verify: "Verification After Account Adjustment".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification Post-Adjustment".

Now, Calls:

In C002's Calls:

First Call: "Call Customer to Request Missing Documents" (though in C001, that's the first Call. Wait, in C001's Call has context: "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs."

Wait, in C001's Call Customer: the context is requesting missing docs, so "Call to Request Missing Documents".

In C002's first Call: "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy".

Second Call in C002: "Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustment".

C003's Call is "Call to Recall Customer Presence".

Now, compiling all:

Let me go through each row in the log and decide the new name for each occurrence of the repeated activities.

Starting with Case C001:

Row 2: Verify Documents (first in case)  "Initial Document Verification".

Row 4: Call Customer (only one in the case, so no need to rename unless there are multiple, but it's only once here. Wait, in C001, "Call Customer" occurs once. So no renaming needed for that.

Row 5: Second Verify: "Re-Verification of Documents".

Case C002:

Rows:

Row 5: Verify Documents (only one in C002, so no change.

Row 6: Call Customer (first in C002)  "Call to Clarify Discrepancy".

Row 7: Call Customer (second in C002)  "Follow-Up Call for Confirmation".

Row 8: Adjust Account (only once, no renaming needed.

Case C003:

Rows:

Row 9: Verify (first)  "Initial Physical Document Verification".

Row 10: Call (only one in C003 except? Wait no, in C003 there's only one Call Customer:

Wait, looking at C003's log:

C003 has:

- Verify (1)  first

- Call (1)  first

- Adjust Account

- Verify (2)  second

- Approve.

Wait, in C003, there's only one Call Customer, so no need to rename that. Wait, let me check the data again:

Looking at the original data:

C003 has:

| C003 | Verify Documents | ... | "Physical verification of ID."

Then next, "Call Customer | ... | Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return."

Then "Adjust Account" then another Verify.

So the Call in C003 is only once, so no renaming needed for Call in that case.

So the only repeated activity in C003 is Verify Documents (two times).

Thus, for the Verifies in C003:

First: "Initial Physical Document Verification"

Second: "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification"

Now, for the Calls in C002:

First Call: "Call to Clarify Discrepancy"

Second: "Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustments"

Alternatively, "Follow-Up Call for Adjustment Confirmation".

Now, for the Verifies in C001 and C003:

C001's Verifies:

First: "Initial Document Verification"

Second: "Re-Verification Following Submission"

C003's Verifies:

First: "Initial Physical Verification"

Second: "Post-Adjustment Re-Verification"

Wait, but the first in C001 is identity docs, the second is after submission of additional docs. The context for the second in C001's Additional Context says "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided".

So, "Re-Verification After ID Submission".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification with Submitted ID".

Alternatively, the key is to make sure that in the same case, the two Verifies have distinct names that make their roles clear.

Now, moving to the revised log:

Let me try to draft the new names for each occurrence:

Case C001:

- The two "Verify Documents" become:

First: "Initial Document Verification"

Second: "Re-Verification of Documents"

But the second is after the customer provided the ID scan, so maybe "Re-Verification with Submitted ID".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification After ID Submission".

Alternatively, using the context's exact description:

First Verify: "Identity Document Verification"

Second: "ID Re-Verification After Submission"

But that's more specific.

Alternatively, the first is "Initial Verification" and the second is "Re-Verification".

But perhaps the names can be:

C001:

First Verify: "Initial Document Verification"

Second: "Re-Verification of Documents"

C003:

First Verify: "Initial Physical Verification"

Second: "Re-Verification After Adjustment"

Alternatively, perhaps the names should be as follows:

For "Verify Documents" in C001:

1. "Initial Document Verification"

2. "Re-Verification Following Additional Submission"

For C003:

1. "Initial Physical Verification"

2. "Post-Adjustment Re-Verification"

For the Calls in C002:

1. "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy"

2. "Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustments"

Now, to ensure that the names are distinct and clear.

Now, let's go through each activity in the log and assign the new names systematically.

Case C001:

- First Verify: "Initial Document Verification"

Second Verify: "Re-Verification of Documents"

Case C002:

First Call: "Call to Clarify Discrepancy"

Second Call: "Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustment"

Case C003's Verifies:

First: "Initial Physical Verification"

Second: "Post-Adjustment Re-Verification"

Alternatively, perhaps "Initial Physical Document Verification" and "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification".

Also, for "Verify Documents" in C003's first, since it's physical, that's a key point, so including "Physical" in the name.

Now, let's map each row:

Now, the revised log tables would have the renamed activities.

Also, check if there are any other repeated activities. Let's see the original log:

Looking at all activities:

Looking for any other repeated activities besides Verify Docs and Calls.

Looking at all activities:

Looking at C002, the "Call Customer" occurs twice, so those need renaming.

Other activities like "Initiate Request" and "Approve Request" are only once per case, so no need.

Now, proceeding to write the revised log with new names and then the justification.

Let me draft the revised log:

Revised Event Log:

Case C001:

| Case ID | Activity          | New Name                          | ... |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-----|
| C001    | Verify Documents  | Initial Document Verification     |
| C001    | Verify Documents  | Re-Verification of Documents     |

Similarly for the others.

Now, compiling the revised log:

Here's the revised log with new names:

Case C001:

- Original: "Verify Documents" first instance  "Initial Document Verification"

- Second instance  "Re-Verification of Documents"

Case C002:

- First Call: "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy"

- Second Call: "Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustment"

Case C003:

- First Verify: "Initial Physical Document Verification"

- Second Verify: "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification"

The "Call Customer" in C003 is only once, so remains as is.

Now, let me tabulate this properly.

Now, the final step is to present the revised log with the renamed activities, then justify each change.

Now, proceeding to present this as per the user's request.

### Justification for Naming Choices:

1. **Verify Documents (C001):**
   - **Initial Document Verification**: Reflects the first check of identity documents at the start of the process.
   - **Re-Verification of Documents**: Indicates this is a follow-up check after the customer submitted additional documents (ID scan), as noted in the context.

2. **Call Customer (C001):**
   - **Follow-Up Call to Request Missing Docs**: Explicitly states the purpose (requesting missing docs), as the first call in this case was triggered by incomplete verification.

3. **Verify Documents (C002):**
   - No renaming needed as it only appears once in C002.

4. **Call Customer (C002):**
   - **Clarification Call**: The first call addresses the account discrepancy.
   - **Confirmation Follow-Up Call**: The second call confirms adjustments were made.

5. **Verify Documents (C003):**
   - **Initial Physical Verification**: Highlights the physical nature of the first check (walk-in customer).
   - **Post-Adjustment Re-Verification**: Indicates it occurs after an account adjustment.

6. **Call Customer (C003):**
   - No renaming needed as it only appears once. The name "Call to Recall Customer Presence" explicitly states it was to retrieve the customer who had stepped out, but since it’s the only instance, it remains "Call Customer" as per the original (since it doesn’t repeat in the case). Wait, but the user instruction says to rename activities that repeat *within the same case*. Since C003 has only one Call, we don’t need to rename it. Wait, in C003, the original activity "Call Customer" occurs once, so no renaming needed. However, in the original log, the Call in C003’s context is to have the customer return. However, since it is only once, it stays as "Call Customer".

Wait, in C003's log, the Call's context says the customer stepped out, so maybe the name can still be renamed to be descriptive, but since it doesn't repeat in the case, it’s fine to leave as "Call Customer". But the user's instruction specifies to rename only those that repeat *within the case*, so only C001's Verifies, C002's Calls, and C003's Verifies need renaming.

So, in C003, the single "Call Customer" remains as is.

### Final Revised Log (with renamed activities):

**Case C001:**
- **Verify Documents**  **Initial Document Verification** (First instance, checks identity docs)
- **Verify Documents**  **Re-Verification of Documents** (Second instance after ID submission)

**Case C002:**
- **Call Customer** (first instance)  **Clarification Call** (Clarify discrepancy)
- **Call Customer** (second instance)  **Follow-Up Confirmation Call** (Confirm adjustments)

**Case C003:**
- **Verify Documents** (first instance)  **Initial Physical Verification** (Physical check at branch)
- **Verify Documents** (second instance)  **Post-Adjustment Re-Verification** (After account adjustment)

---

### Key Naming Logic:
- **"Initial" vs. "Re-Verification"**: Distinguishes first vs. follow-up checks.
- **Physical vs. Digital Contexts**: "Initial Physical Verification" for in-person cases.
- **Purpose-Driven Names**: "Clarification Call" vs. "Follow-Up Confirmation Call" for C002’s calls.
- **Timing/Trigger**: "Post-Adjustment" in C003’s second Verify indicates it occurs after an account change.

This ensures each renamed activity’s purpose and context are explicit, even if similar activity names appear in other cases.
