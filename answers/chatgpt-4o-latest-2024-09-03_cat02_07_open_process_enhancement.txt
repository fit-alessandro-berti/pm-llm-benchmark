### Process Enhancement in Process Mining

**Process enhancement** is one of the core objectives of process mining that focuses on improving existing business processes by analyzing real-life event data and comparing it with the existing process models. The goal of process enhancement is not merely to visualize or check for conformance but to use the insights gained from process mining to make the current processes more efficient, effective, or aligned with organizational goals. 

Process enhancement typically involves identifying inefficiencies, bottlenecks, deviations, and redundancies in the process and suggesting changes or improvements, such as eliminating unnecessary tasks, automating parts of the process, or reallocating resources.

### Key Activities in Process Enhancement:
1. **Identifying Performance Deviations**: Analyze deviations from key performance indicators (KPIs) such as time, cost, or quality. For example, processes that take longer than expected, costs that exceed budgets, or frequent errors can be identified for potential improvement.
   
2. **Detecting Bottlenecks**: Pinpoint where delays or inefficiencies occur (e.g., tasks that take too long or resources that are over-burdened) and suggest ways to improve the workflow.
   
3. **Improving Resource Allocation**: By analyzing how resources (employees, machines, software systems) are used across the process, enhancements can be proposed to better allocate resources.

4. **Recommending Automation**: Parts of the process that are highly repetitive and time-consuming may benefit from automation (e.g., automating data entry or decision-making tasks).

5. **Optimizing Decision Points**: Analyze the points in the process where decisions are made, ensuring that decisions are based on the best available data and performed in the most efficient manner.

### How It Differs from Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

1. **Process Discovery**
   - **Objective**: Process discovery involves constructing a process model based on event data from information systems. The goal is to discover the sequence of activities, their relationships, and pathways.
   - **Focus**: In process discovery, you usually don’t start with a predefined process model. Instead, the event log gives you insights into what the process actually looks like in reality.
   - **Usage**: Helps to visualize the "as-is" process and understand how activities progress, but it stops at providing a descriptive understanding of the workflow, without necessarily identifying problems or improvements.

2. **Conformance Checking**
   - **Objective**: This stage involves comparing the discovered or existing process model with the real-life event data captured in event logs to see if the process is being followed as expected.
   - **Focus**: The focus is on detecting misalignments between the "as-is" model and the "to-be" process model (i.e., are people or systems deviating from prescribed workflows?).
   - **Usage**: Helps to check how much the real process conforms to the ideal process (aligning theory with practice), but does not provide direct recommendations on how to improve.

3. **Process Enhancement**
   - **Objective**: Process enhancement goes beyond discovery and conformance by focusing explicitly on improving the process. After identifying both non-conforming and conforming areas, the next step is recommending changes to refine overall performance.
   - **Focus**: The primary focus here is on making tangible improvements—whether reducing delays, optimizing resource usage, or increasing the overall efficiency of the process.
   - **Usage**: Allows decision-makers to take targeted actions that improve business outcomes based on the analytical findings from discovery and conformance. It emphasizes continuous improvement, not just understanding or compliance.

### Example: Workflow in a Customer Service Process
- **Process Discovery**: You discover that a typical customer support case follows specific steps — logging the issue, assigning it to the right department, troubleshooting, and closing the case.
- **Conformance Checking**: You compare this process with what actually happens in your data — some employees might skip the step of assigning the issue formally, or take too long to log the issue.
- **Process Enhancement**: After identifying that the logging step takes too long and often causes delays, you suggest automating it with a specialized support ticketing system that automatically logs cases as they enter the system, reducing processing time by 20%.

### Conclusion
Process enhancement, as part of process mining, is an action-oriented step focusing on improving rather than just analyzing. While process discovery is about understanding processes and conformance checking ensures compliance, process enhancement moves the organization toward optimization and better performance by leveraging data-driven insights to solve practical issues.
