### Process Enhancement in Process Mining

**Process enhancement** is one of the core activities in process mining that focuses on improving or optimizing an existing process model or operational process. The goal of process enhancement is to leverage data extracted from event logs to identify ways to refine, extend, or enhance the current process model, leading to better performance, efficiency, or overall outcomes. The enhancements can be diverse, such as adjusting workflows, identifying bottlenecks, or improving resource allocation strategies.

Typically, process enhancement involves overlaying insights from observed behavior (in event logs) onto an existing process model to propose adjustments that enhance the system's functionality or performance. Key elements of process enhancement could include:

1. **Bottleneck handling:** Identifying steps or activities that delay the process and improving the speed or capacity of those steps.
2. **Cycle time reduction:** Shortening the time taken for the process by eliminating inefficiencies.
3. **Resource optimization:** Improving resource allocation by analyzing workload distribution among employees or machinery.
4. **Performance visuals:** Adding performance-related information (e.g., time statistics) to the process model to give a clearer picture of how the process functions in practice.

In process enhancement, the as-is processes are adjusted to become more effective, efficient, or aligned with strategic goals.

### How Process Enhancement Differs from Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

1. **Process Discovery:**

    - **Goal:** Process discovery focuses on generating a process model **from scratch** based on event data logged during the execution of activities.
    - **Description:** In this stage, a model is built purely from the event logs that represent the real behavior of the system. The aim is not to change or improve anything but to reveal the actual workflow that has been happening within the system.
    - **Example:** If a company uses a software system to track customer orders, process discovery would generate the process model showing how customer orders flow through the system, capturing both intended and unintended variations in the process.

    - **Difference from Process Enhancement:** Process discovery doesn't aim to improve the process but rather to discover what is actually happening. It informs you of the **as-is** state, while enhancement takes that model and improves upon it.

2. **Conformance Checking:**

    - **Goal:** Conformance checking compares an existing process model to an event log to see how well reality (actual process behavior) conforms to the designed model or expectations.
    - **Description:** The primary aim is to validate whether the current process execution matches the intended or expected model. It checks for deviations and violations of business rules that may indicate non-compliance or inefficiencies.
    - **Example:** A business may have a standardized approval process for customer requests. Conformance checking would compare actual request handling (from event logs) with the expected approval process model to identify cases where tasks were skipped or extra steps were performed.

    - **Difference from Process Enhancement:** Conformance checking is about **detecting deviations** and ensuring compliance, while process enhancement is about **improving** the model or process. Conformance checking checks how closely reality matches the model, but process enhancement seeks to change and improve either based on deviations or performance data.

### Summary of Differences:

- **Process Discovery:**
  - Objective: Build a model from event logs.
  - Outcome: A process model discovered from actual executions.

- **Conformance Checking:**
  - Objective: Compare process executions to an existing model and identify deviations.
  - Outcome: A report on how well the process conforms to the expected model.

- **Process Enhancement:**
  - Objective: Improve the existing process model based on insights (performance, deviations, bottlenecks).
  - Outcome: A refined/optimized process model that aims for better performance.

In short, **process discovery** creates a model from event data, **conformance checking** ensures that real executions align with the predefined model, and **process enhancement** optimizes or improves the process based on data insights from the logs.
