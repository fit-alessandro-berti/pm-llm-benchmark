 Certainly! Below is an example of how you might implement a simple Purchase-to-Pay process tree using pm4py. This process includes the following steps:

1. The purchase order is created (Purchase Order Creation).
2. Goods are received (Goods Receipt).
3. The invoice is received (Invoice Receipt).
4. The invoice is checked against the purchase order and the goods received note (Three-Way Match).
5. The payment is processed (Payment Processing).

In this example, we will assume that the purchase order creation must happen before goods receipt, and invoice receipt must happen before the three-way match. The three-way match and payment processing are sequential, but the payment can only occur if the three-way match is successful. We will represent the receipt of the invoice and the goods as parallel activities since they can happen independently of each other.

Here's how you can implement this process tree in pm4py:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Define the root of the process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Define the leaf nodes (activities)
purchase_order_creation = ProcessTree(label="Purchase Order Creation", parent=root)
goods_receipt = ProcessTree(label="Goods Receipt", parent=root)
invoice_receipt = ProcessTree(label="Invoice Receipt", parent=root)
three_way_match = ProcessTree(label="Three-Way Match", parent=root)
payment_processing = ProcessTree(label="Payment Processing", parent=root)

# Define the sequence operator for the sequential part of the process
seq_goods_invoice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
seq_three_way_payment = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)

# Define the parallel operator for the parallel activities
parallel_goods_invoice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)

# Assign children to the sequence and parallel operators
seq_goods_invoice.children.append(goods_
