### **Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Delays**

#### **1. Identifying Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**
First, let's calculate the **total resolution time** (from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket") for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time          | End Time            | Total Resolution Time (Hours) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00    | 2024-03-01 10:15    | **2.25 hours**                |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05    | 2024-03-02 09:15    | **25.17 hours (~1 day 1 hr)** |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10    | 2024-03-01 09:30    | **1.33 hours**                |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20    | 2024-03-02 08:30    | **24.17 hours (~1 day)**      |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25    | 2024-03-03 09:30    | **50.08 hours (~2 days 2 hrs)**|

**Observations:**
- **Fastest cases (101, 103):** Resolved in **<2.5 hours**.
- **Moderately delayed cases (102, 104):** Resolved in **~1 day**.
- **Most delayed case (105):** Resolved in **~2 days**.

**Significantly delayed cases:** **102, 104, 105** (with **105 being the worst**).

#### **2. Root Causes of Performance Issues**
We analyze the **bottlenecks** in the delayed cases by examining:
- **Escalations** (Level-1  Level-2)
- **Waiting times between activities**
- **Delays before investigation/resolution**

##### **Case 102 (25.17 hours)**
- **Escalation:** Yes (Level-1  Level-2 at **11:30**).
- **Key Delays:**
  - **2.5-hour gap** between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:00) and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (11:30).
  - **2.5-hour gap** between "Escalate" (11:30) and "Investigate Issue" (14:00).
  - **Overnight delay** (14:00  next day 09:00) before resolution.
- **Root Cause:**
  - **Level-1 agent struggled** (2.5-hour delay before escalation).
  - **Level-2 team took time to pick up** (2.5-hour delay after escalation).
  - **Overnight hold** (likely due to shift change or backlog).

##### **Case 104 (24.17 hours)**
- **Escalation:** No.
- **Key Delays:**
  - **3.5-hour gap** between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:30) and "Investigate Issue" (13:00).
  - **Overnight delay** (13:00  next day 08:00) before resolution.
- **Root Cause:**
  - **Level-1 agent delayed investigation** (3.5-hour wait).
  - **Overnight hold** (likely due to shift change or backlog).

##### **Case 105 (50.08 hours)**
- **Escalation:** Yes (Level-1  Level-2 at **10:00**).
- **Key Delays:**
  - **Short initial investigation** (10 min) before escalation.
  - **28-hour gap** between "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (10:00) and "Investigate Issue" (next day 14:00).
  - **Overnight delay** (14:00  next day 09:00) before resolution.
- **Root Cause:**
  - **Level-2 team took an extremely long time to start** (28-hour delay).
  - **Possible backlog or resource constraints** in Level-2.

#### **3. Key Factors Leading to Increased Cycle Times**
| **Factor**               | **Impact on Delay** | **Evidence from Cases** |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Escalations**          | High                | Cases 102 & 105 had escalations, leading to **longer resolution times** (25+ hours). |
| **Level-1 Agent Delays** | Medium              | Cases 102 & 104 had **3.5+ hour delays** before investigation/escalation. |
| **Level-2 Team Delays**  | Very High           | Case 105 had a **28-hour delay** before Level-2 started investigating. |
| **Overnight Holds**      | High                | Cases 102, 104, 105 had **delays spanning multiple days** due to shift changes. |
| **Backlog in Escalations** | High              | Level-2 team seems **overloaded**, leading to long wait times. |

### **4. Insights & Recommendations**
#### **A. Process-Level Improvements**
1. **Reduce Escalation Delays**
   - **Problem:** Level-2 team is a **major bottleneck** (28-hour delay in Case 105).
   - **Solution:**
     - **Increase Level-2 staffing** or **prioritize escalated tickets**.
     - **Automate escalation routing** to reduce manual delays.
     - **Set SLAs for Level-2 response times** (e.g., "Investigate within 4 hours").

2. **Improve Level-1 Agent Efficiency**
   - **Problem:** Level-1 agents sometimes **delay investigation** (3.5+ hours in Cases 102 & 104).
   - **Solution:**
     - **Provide better training** to handle common issues without escalation.
     - **Implement automated triage** (e.g., AI-based categorization) to speed up initial assessment.
     - **Set time limits** for Level-1 investigation (e.g., "Escalate within 2 hours if unresolved").

3. **Minimize Overnight Delays**
   - **Problem:** Tickets **pile up overnight**, leading to multi-day resolutions.
   - **Solution:**
     - **Extend support hours** (e.g., 24/7 coverage for critical issues).
     - **Implement shift handover protocols** to ensure continuity.
     - **Prioritize overnight tickets** in the next shift.

4. **Monitor & Optimize Workflows**
   - **Problem:** Some cases (101, 103) resolve **quickly**, while others (105) take **days**.
   - **Solution:**
     - **Use process mining tools** to identify **bottlenecks in real-time**.
     - **Track KPIs** (e.g., "Time to First Response," "Escalation Rate," "Resolution Time by Level").
     - **Conduct root cause analysis** on delayed cases to **prevent recurrence**.

#### **B. Technology & Automation Recommendations**
- **AI-Powered Triage:** Automatically categorize and route tickets to the right team.
- **Chatbots for Initial Support:** Reduce Level-1 workload by handling simple queries.
- **Automated Escalation Triggers:** If a ticket isn’t picked up within X hours, auto-escalate.
- **Real-Time Dashboards:** Monitor **ticket aging** and **team workload** to prevent backlogs.

#### **C. Organizational Recommendations**
- **Cross-Training Agents:** Enable Level-1 agents to handle **some Level-2 issues** to reduce escalations.
- **Incentivize Fast Resolution:** Reward teams that **meet SLAs consistently**.
- **Customer Communication:** If delays are unavoidable, **proactively update customers** to manage expectations.

### **5. Summary of Findings & Action Plan**
| **Issue** | **Impact** | **Recommended Fix** | **Expected Outcome** |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Level-2 Team Bottleneck** | High | Increase staffing, set SLAs, automate routing | Faster escalation handling |
| **Level-1 Agent Delays** | Medium | Training, automated triage, time limits | Fewer unnecessary escalations |
| **Overnight Delays** | High | Extended hours, shift handover protocols | Faster resolution, fewer multi-day cases |
| **Lack of Real-Time Monitoring** | Medium | Process mining, KPI tracking | Proactive bottleneck detection |

**Final Insight:**
The **biggest delays** come from:
1. **Level-2 team being overloaded** (Case 105).
2. **Level-1 agents taking too long to escalate** (Cases 102, 104).
3. **Overnight holds** (Cases 102, 104, 105).

**Top Priority Actions:**
 **Hire/train more Level-2 agents** to reduce escalation delays.
 **Implement automated triage & escalation rules** to speed up Level-1.
 **Extend support hours or improve shift handover** to minimize overnight delays.

By addressing these **three key areas**, the support team can **reduce resolution times by 50-70%** and improve customer satisfaction.
