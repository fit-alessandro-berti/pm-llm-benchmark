### Identified Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):** An average of about 25 hours with a very low standard deviation suggests a strict, possibly artificial schedule for approvals.
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):** An extremely long average delay of 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days indicates significant variability in notification timing, with some notifications occurring much faster or slower than expected.
3. **A to C (Assign to Close):** A relatively quick closure of 2 hours on average suggests claims might be prematurely closed without going through necessary steps like Evaluate or Approve.
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** An average of only 5 minutes between evaluation and notification is unusually short, possibly indicating skipped steps in the process.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):** The low standard deviation might indicate a strict process guideline or automated system enforcing a specific approval timeframe. Alternatively, it might reflect administrative inefficiencies that are consistently delaying the approval process.
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):** The high variability could be due to differences in how promptly notifications are generated once a claim is approved, potentially due to varying levels of resource availability or differing priorities across regions or adjusters.
3. **A to C (Assign to Close):** Claims closing quickly after assignment might suggest that some claims are being marked as closed prematurely without completing necessary evaluations or approvals, possibly due to human error or system misconfiguration.
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** The short time between evaluation and notification might indicate that notifications are being generated immediately after the evaluation step without taking into account the necessary time for other evaluations or approvals, or it could be due to skipping steps in the process.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **Identify Claims with Unusual Approval Times:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, 
          MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS receive_time,
          MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) AS time_to_approve
   FROM claim_events
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) < (3600 * 8 - 3600) OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) > (3600 * 8 + 3600);
   ```

2. **Correlate Abnormal Approval Times with Adjusters:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.claim_id, a.name AS adjuster_name,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END))) AS time_to_approve
   FROM claim_events ce
   JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = ce.resource
   GROUP BY ce.claim_id, a.name
   HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END))) < (3600 * 8 - 3600) OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END))) > (3600 * 8 + 3600);
   ```

3. **Identify Claims with Unusual Notification Delays:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.claim_id, 
          MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
          MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END))) AS time_to_notify
   FROM claim_events ce
   GROUP BY ce.claim_id
   HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END))) < (604800 - 172800) OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END))) > (604800 + 172800);
   ```

4. **Filter by Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.adjuster_id,
          MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS assign_time,
          MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS close_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END))) AS time_to_close
   FROM claim_events ce
   GROUP BY ce.claim_id, ce.adjuster_id
   HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END))) < 7200;
   ```

5. **Filter by Claims Where Notification is Generated Soon After Evaluation:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.adjuster_id,
          MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS evaluate_time,
          MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END))) AS time_to_notify
   FROM claim_events ce
   GROUP BY ce.claim_id, ce.adjuster_id
   HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END))) < 300;
   ```

These queries aim to isolate and analyze the claims that exhibit unusual timing patterns, providing insights into potential systemic issues within the claim handling process.
