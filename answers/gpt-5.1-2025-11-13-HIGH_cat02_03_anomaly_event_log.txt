**1. Reference: Typical Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Flow**

A standard, well-controlled P2P process usually follows this order:

1. Create Purchase Requisition (PR)  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order (PO)  
4. Receive Goods / Services  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO (and goods) – 3way match  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case  

Key control rules:
- No PO before PR approval  
- No payment before goods are received and invoice is matched  
- Matching (approval) is done before payment, not after

## Case-by-case Analysis

### Case 1001 – Baseline / Normal

**Sequence:**

Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  Receive Goods  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case

This follows the expected P2P process:

- Approval precedes PO.
- Goods are received before payment.
- Invoice is matched to PO before payment.
- Payment is only released after the 3way match.

**Conclusion:** Case 1001 looks standard and can be treated as a reference for normal behavior.

### Case 1002 – Multiple Serious Order Violations

**Sequence:**

Create PR  Issue PO  Vendor Invoice Received  **Release Payment**  Approve PR  Receive Goods  Match Invoice to PO  Close Case

**Anomalies:**

1. **PO issued before PR approval**
   - `Issue Purchase Order` occurs before `Approve Purchase Requisition`.
   - This bypasses the basic control that spending must be approved before committing to a supplier.
   - Risk: Unauthorized orders, budget overruns, or maverick spending.

2. **Payment before requisition approval**
   - `Release Payment` occurs even before `Approve Purchase Requisition`.
   - The organization is paying for something that was not properly authorized at all at the time of payment.
   - Risk: Serious control breakdown; potential fraud and audit issues.

3. **Payment before goods receipt and invoice matching**
   - `Release Payment` happens before `Receive Goods` and before `Match Invoice to PO`.
   - This violates the 3way match principle (PO–Goods–Invoice) that is designed to ensure:
     - The goods/services were actually received.
     - The invoice is correct and corresponds to what was ordered and delivered.
   - Risk: Paying for goods not yet delivered, incorrect quantities, or wrong prices.

4. **Invoice matching after payment**
   - `Match Invoice to PO` occurs after `Release Payment`.
   - Matching becomes a purely retrospective check, no longer a preventative control.
   - Risk: Any discrepancies discovered at this stage are harder to recover (requires credit notes, disputes, etc.), and the control may be ineffective.

**Conclusion:** Case 1002 is strongly anomalous. It shows a breakdown of approvals and of the core financial control (3way matching) by paying too early and regularizing the paperwork afterward.

### Case 1003 – Payment Before Invoice and Goods

**Sequence:**

Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  **Release Payment**  Vendor Invoice Received  Receive Goods  Match Invoice to PO  Close Case

**Anomalies:**

1. **Payment before invoice receipt**
   - `Release Payment` happens before `Vendor Invoice Received`.
   - In standard P2P, a payment is triggered by an approved invoice, not the other way around.
   - This effectively means paying without having a billing document to validate amount, terms, tax, etc.
   - Risk: Overpayment, wrong vendor, missing tax compliance, difficulty in reconciliation.

2. **Payment before goods receipt**
   - Payment also precedes `Receive Goods`.
   - This could be interpreted as a prepayment/advance payment; however:
     - There is no explicit indication that this is a special process (e.g., “Create Down Payment Request”).
     - It uses the same `Release Payment` activity as normal cases, making it indistinguishable from standard payments.
   - Risk: Paying for items that may never be delivered or delivered late; weaker leverage with supplier.

3. **Invoice matching after payment**
   - `Match Invoice to PO` occurs after both payment and goods receipt.
   - Like in Case 1002, matching is turned into a post-fact control.
   - Risk: Same as above – discrepancies found only after money is gone.

**Conclusion:** Case 1003 shows a serious control issue: payment is made without an invoice and before delivery, and the 3way match is done afterward. Unless this is a clearly separated “prepayment” process (which the log does not indicate), this is a clear anomaly.

### Case 1004 – Goods Received Before PO

**Sequence:**

Create PR  Approve PR  **Receive Goods**  Issue PO  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case

**Anomalies:**

1. **Goods receipt before PO issue**
   - `Receive Goods` occurs before `Issue Purchase Order`.
   - In a standard P2P process, the PO is the formal commitment to the vendor and should precede delivery.
   - This suggests:
     - The supplier delivered without a formal order, or
     - The order was made informally (e.g., by phone) and the system PO was created afterwards (“after-the-fact” PO).
   - Risk: Maverick buying, poor spend control, potential non-compliance with internal policies or contracts, difficulty enforcing negotiated prices/terms.

2. **Otherwise correct downstream sequence**
   - After the PO is issued, the sequence is normal:
     - Invoice after PO,
     - Matching before payment,
     - Payment after match.
   - So the main anomaly is in the procurement/ordering side, not the payables side.

**Conclusion:** Case 1004 shows a procurement anomaly: goods are received before a formal PO exists in the system. This undermines the control that purchases must be requested and approved before the organization becomes liable.

## Summary of Anomalies and Why They Matter

**Main anomalous patterns:**

1. **Approval after commitment or payment (Case 1002)**
   - PO and payment occur before PR approval.
   - Violates basic authorization controls and budgeting discipline.

2. **Payment before goods and/or invoice (Cases 1002 and 1003)**
   - Payment is made before goods receipt and before invoice matching; in Case 1003, even before the invoice exists.
   - Undermines the 3way match control and exposes the organization to paying for undelivered or unverified items.

3. **Matching after payment (Cases 1002 and 1003)**
   - Invoice-to-PO matching is done post-payment.
   - Turns a preventative control into a detective control, with late detection of problems and higher recovery effort.

4. **Goods before PO (Case 1004)**
   - Delivery is recorded before a formal PO exists.
   - Indicates after-the-fact ordering, maverick buying, or emergency purchases not properly documented.

**Overall impact:**

- Increased risk of fraud and errors  
- Weak budgetary and authorization control  
- Potential audit and compliance issues  
- Possible financial losses from overpayments or non-delivery  

Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 are anomalous relative to standard P2P best practices; Case 1001 serves as a compliant reference.
