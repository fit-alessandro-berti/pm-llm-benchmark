Got it . We need to construct a **representative temporal profile dictionary** for the global supply chain process.  

The dictionary should include not only **directly sequential pairs** (e.g., `('SS','OP')`) but also **indirect pairs** where one activity eventually follows another (e.g., `('SS','QI')`, `('OP','CA')`).  

We’ll provide **plausible estimated average times (in seconds)** and standard deviations (also in seconds), grounded in real-world supply chain dynamics but synthetic for this example.  

Here’s a representative subset:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Early procurement stages
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 7200),          # 1 day avg, 2 hours deviation
    ('SS', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),        # 1 week avg, 1 day deviation
    ('SS', 'QI'): (691200, 93600),        # ~8 days avg, variation ~1.1 days
    
    ('OP', 'RC'): (518400, 43200),        # 6 days avg, 12h deviation
    ('OP', 'QI'): (604800, 86400),        # 7 days avg, 1 day deviation

    # Component validation & assembly
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 7200),          # 12 hours avg, 2h deviation
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 14400),         # 1 day avg, 4h deviation
    ('RC', 'CA'): (129600, 21600),        # ~1.5 days avg
    
    # Downstream production
    ('CA', 'PT'): (172800, 28800),        # 2 days avg, ~8h deviation
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 7200),          # 12 hours avg
    ('PK', 'WS'): (21600, 3600),          # 6h avg
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 43200),        # 3 days avg
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 172800),       # ~7 days avg, variability 2 days

    # Long-distance indirect relations
    ('SS', 'CA'): (777600, 93600),        # 9 days avg, ~1.1 days deviation
    ('OP', 'PT'): (864000, 100800),       # 10 days avg
    ('RC', 'PK'): (388800, 43200),        # ~4.5 days avg
    ('QI', 'DT'): (950400, 129600),       # ~11 days avg
    ('CA', 'AS'): (1382400, 172800),      # 16 days avg
}
```

### Notes on Design:
- **Unit:** All times are in **seconds** to maintain consistency with the temporal profile specification.
- **Averages** are rough **synthetic estimates** based on supply chain phases:
  - Procurement spans **days to a week**.
  - Inspection & assembly takes **hours to a few days**.
  - Distribution could take up to **a week+**.
- **Standard deviations** are proportional to the activity’s variability (procurement highly variable, testing less so).
- Covers **direct and non-direct pairs** for richer temporal structure.

 Would you like me to **expand this set** to cover **all possible pairs** across the 10 activities (`10 choose 2 = 45` pairs), or keep it at this **representative subset** for balance between completeness and readability?
