To achieve the requirements outlined in your prompt using DuckDB SQL, we can formulate a query that identifies cases containing the specific sequence of activities. We'll then check the time elapsed between the relevant events and filter out the cases that meet all the conditions.

Here's how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
WITH SequenceCases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        MIN(timestamp) AS approve_time,
        MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'Create Order') AS create_time,
        MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'Confirm Order') AS confirm_time
    FROM event_log
    WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING 
        COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 3 -- Ensure all three activities are present
        AND MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition') <
            MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'Create Order') <
            MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'Confirm Order') -- Ensure the order is correct
)

-- Filter out cases that meet the criteria of the sequence and timing
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM SequenceCases
    WHERE (confirm_time - create_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
);
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) - `SequenceCases`:**
   - We select the `case_id` and the minimum timestamps of each relevant activity.
   - We filter rows where the `activity` is one of the three specified.
   - We group the results by `case_id`.
   - The `HAVING` clause ensures all three activities are present and occur in the correct order.

2. **Main Selection Query:**
   - We select all records from the `event_log` table.
   - We use a subquery to retrieve `case_id`s from the `SequenceCases` CTE that meet the timing condition (the elapsed time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' being more than 5 days).
   - The main query then excludes any such cases, thus providing the desired result of events from cases that do not match the specified sequence with the timing condition.

This query efficiently filters the event log to meet all stipulations provided in your prompt.
