Thank you for that comprehensive overview. I'd like to dig deeper into several aspects of your property onboarding process. Let me ask you some clarifying questions:

## Initial Contact and Documentation

1. When a landlord first contacts your regional office, what determines which property coordinator handles their request? Is there a rotation system, or are coordinators specialized by property type or location?

2. You mentioned requesting updates for missing or outdated documents - what's your typical turnaround time for landlords to provide these, and what happens if they're unresponsive? Is there a point where you decline to proceed?

3. What constitutes "outdated" for inspection reports and certificates of compliance? Do you have different standards for different municipalities?

## Property Manager Assignment

4. Can you walk me through the actual decision-making process for assigning a property manager? Who makes this decision, and what happens if no suitable manager is available based on your criteria?

5. How do you define and measure a property manager's "workload"? Is it based on number of properties, number of units, or something else?

6. What happens if the introductory meeting between the property manager and landlord doesn't go well? Is there a process to reassign to a different manager?

## Inspection and Marketing

7. How much time typically passes between scheduling the photographer/inspector and their actual visit? What if the landlord isn't available during the scheduled time?

8. You mentioned the property manager works with landlords to address inspection issues - what's your threshold for determining a property is too problematic to onboard? Have you ever had to reject a property after multiple failed inspections?

9. How does your digital marketing team determine the appropriate marketing channels and materials for different property types? Is this standardized or customized per property?

## Tenant Selection and Lease Finalization

10. When you have multiple interested tenants, who has the final say in tenant selection - the property manager or the landlord? How do you handle disagreements between them?

11. What's your process if a selected tenant fails a final verification step (like employment verification) after being provisionally approved?

12. You mentioned custom lease clauses that some landlords insist on - how do you balance these requests with your standard procedures? Who approves these exceptions?

## Quality Control and Compliance

13. At what points can the compliance officer or financial analyst halt or reverse the onboarding process? What happens to work already completed if they identify issues?

14. How do you handle situations where different departments (compliance, finance, IT) have conflicting requirements or timelines?

## Process Management

15. How long does the entire onboarding process typically take from initial contact to property activation? What's the longest it's ever taken, and why?

16. Who monitors the overall progress of each property through the onboarding pipeline? How do you identify and address bottlenecks?

17. What happens if a landlord wants to onboard multiple properties simultaneously? Do you handle them as a batch or individually?

## Exception Handling

18. Can you give me examples of the most common exceptions you encounter, and how your team typically resolves them?

19. Is there a formal escalation path when standard procedures don't apply? Who has the authority to approve deviations from the normal process?

20. How do you handle urgent onboarding requests - for instance, if a landlord needs their property listed within days rather than weeks?

## Communication and Coordination

21. You mentioned using email, CRMs, and project management tools - how do you ensure nothing falls through the cracks when communication is spread across multiple platforms?

22. How do external stakeholders (photographers, inspectors, contractors) integrate with your internal communication flow? Do they have access to your systems?

23. What triggers updates to the landlord throughout the process? Are these automated or manually initiated by the property manager?

These questions should help me better understand the nuances and decision points in your property onboarding process. Are there any other critical aspects I haven't touched on that you think are important to discuss?
