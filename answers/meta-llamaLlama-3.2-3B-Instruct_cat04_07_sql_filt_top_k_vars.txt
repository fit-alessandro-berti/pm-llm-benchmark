**Benchmark Solution:**

The provided SQL query utilizes the following DuckDB features and functions:

- `ORDER BY`: Used to sort the events within each case by their `timestamp`.
- `GROUP BY`: Used to group the sorted events by their complete activity sequence.
- `ROW_NUMBER()`: Used to assign a unique number to each row within a result set, which is then used for ranking.
- `DENSE_RANK()`: Used to assign the same rank to tied rows, which is used for counting variants.
- `PERCENT_RANK()`: Used to calculate the relative rank of a value within its partition, which is used for determining the top K variants.

```sql
WITH 
-- First, sort each case by timestamp and assign a row number
sorted_cases AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id, 
    activity, 
    timestamp, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as row_num
  FROM 
    event_log
),

-- Then, group by complete activity sequence
activity_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id, 
    LISTAGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence
  FROM 
    sorted_cases
  GROUP BY 
    case_id
),

-- Rank variants by frequency
variant_rank AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_sequence, 
    COUNT(case_id) as variant_count,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(case_id) DESC) as percent_rank
  FROM 
    activity_sequences
  GROUP BY 
    activity_sequence
),

-- Finally, filter down to the top K variants
top_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    * FROM variant_rank
  WHERE 
    percent_rank <= (100 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM variant_rank))
),

-- Get all events for cases belonging to the top K variants
final_result AS (
  SELECT 
    * FROM event_log
  WHERE 
    case_id IN (
      SELECT 
        case_id FROM activity_sequences
      WHERE 
        activity_sequence IN (
          SELECT 
            activity_sequence FROM top_variants
          ORDER BY variant_count DESC
          LIMIT (100 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM variant_rank))
        )
    )
)
SELECT * FROM final_result;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **First step:** The `sorted_cases` CTE sorts each case by its `timestamp` and assigns a row number within each case.

2. **Second step:** The `activity_sequences` CTE groups the sorted events by their complete activity sequence.

3. **Third step:** The `variant_rank` CTE ranks the activity sequences by their frequency and calculates the relative rank within each partition.

4. **Fourth step:** The `top_variants` CTE filters the activity sequences to the top K variants based on their frequency.

5. **Fifth step:** The `final_result` CTE selects all events from the `event_log` that belong to cases that follow the top K variants. 

The final result will contain all events from the original log that are part of the top K variants, ordered by their timestamp.
