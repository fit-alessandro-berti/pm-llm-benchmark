### Explanation

**Case Identification Logic:**  
- Cases were grouped by **specific documents or tasks** (e.g., `Document1.docx`, `Annual Meeting Email`, `Budget_2024.xlsx`). 
- A new case was created when the user switched to a new application/window *and* performed meaningful work (e.g., typing, saving, replying).  
- Interleaved work (e.g., returning to `Document1.docx` after working on a spreadsheet) was treated as part of the original case.

**Activity Naming Logic:**  
- Low-level actions were mapped to **process-centric steps** (e.g., `TYPING`  `Draft Content`, `CLICK + Send Email`  `Send Reply`).  
- Contextual cues (e.g., `Window=Email - Inbox` + `Action=Reply`  `Compose Reply`) were used to infer higher-level intent.  
- `SWITCH` events were used to infer case boundaries but not explicitly retained as activities.

**Key Assumptions:**  
- Focus on documents/emails as process instances (cases).  
- Temporal proximity and task continuity were prioritized (e.g., the user’s return to `Document1.docx` after a break was treated as part of the same case).  
- Raw actions (e.g., `SCROLL`) were only retained if they represented meaningful steps (e.g., `Review Document`).
