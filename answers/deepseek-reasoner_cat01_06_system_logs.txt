### Explanation

#### **Case Identification Logic**
1. **Document1**: Grouped all events related to `Document1.docx`, including the initial editing session and the later return after working on Excel. The `SWITCH` back to Document1 after Excel was treated as a continuation of the same case.
2. **Email**: Events related to handling the "Annual Meeting" email in Chrome, starting with the `SWITCH` to Chrome and ending with sending the reply.
3. **ReportReview**: Actions on `Report_Draft.pdf` in Adobe Acrobat, including reviewing and highlighting.
4. **BudgetUpdate**: Focused work on `Budget_2024.xlsx`, including updates and saves.
5. **QuarterlyReport**: Combined the initial `FOCUS` event and the later work session into one case, assuming the user returned to the report after finishing other tasks.

#### **Activity Naming**
- Low-level actions like `TYPING` were generalized to **Edit Document** or **Update Budget Figures** to reflect the user’s intent.
- `SWITCH` events were mapped to contextual actions like **Start Email Session** or **Resume Editing**.
- `SAVE`/`CLOSE` events were standardized to **Save Document** or **Close Document** for consistency.
- Email-specific actions (e.g., `CLICK` to reply) were translated into **Compose Reply** or **Send Email** to reflect process steps.

#### **Coherence**
- Cases represent distinct work units (e.g., editing a document, replying to an email).
- Temporal gaps within cases (e.g., interruptions between Document1 sessions) were retained to reflect real-world task-switching behavior.
- The `QuarterlyReport` case includes both the initial and final sessions to capture the full lifecycle of the report, despite the gap.
