Below is a compact POWL specification that fits all five cases contained in the log.  
The model keeps every activity explicit, isolates the two “retry” patterns in LOOP
constructs, makes the optional Labeling step an XORchoice, and links everything
together in one (mainly sequential) strict-partial order.



```python
# Imports -------------------------------------------------------------
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj       import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator


# 1. Atomic activities -----------------------------------------------
OR   = Transition("OR")      # Order received
MS   = Transition("MS")      # Material sourcing
QS   = Transition("QS")      # Quality screening
AS   = Transition("AS")      # Assembly
IQC  = Transition("IQC")     # In-line quality check
TST  = Transition("TST")     # Testing
RT   = Transition("RT")      # Re-testing
PK   = Transition("PK")      # Packaging
LB   = Transition("LB")      # Labeling
DP   = Transition("DP")      # Distribution planning
D    = Transition("D")       # Dispatch
tau  = SilentTransition()    #  – used for “skip-labeling” branch


# 2. Compound building blocks ----------------------------------------
# 2.1  Assembly / in-line QC   (can be repeated)
assembly_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP,
                             children=[AS, IQC])
# semantics:  do AS once, then            
#             either leave the loop OR      IQC  AS  (repeat…)
#             perform IQC and start over  


# 2.2  Testing / re-testing     (can be repeated)
testing_loop  = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP,
                             children=[TST, RT])
# semantics:  TST once, then optionally RT  TST  … until product passes


# 2.3  Optional labeling
labeling_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR,
                               children=[LB, tau])
# semantics: do LB   OR   silently skip it


# 3. Global partial order --------------------------------------------
# (The nodes list is fixed; the arcs define the required execution order)
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
        OR, MS, QS,                  # up-front sourcing & screening
        assembly_loop,               # assembly / IQC loop
        testing_loop,                # testing / re-testing loop
        PK,                          # packaging
        labeling_choice,             # optional labeling
        DP, D])                      # distribution & dispatch


# 4. Control-flow constraints (arcs) ---------------------------------
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, assembly_loop)
root.order.add_edge(assembly_loop, testing_loop)
root.order.add_edge(testing_loop, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, labeling_choice)
root.order.add_edge(labeling_choice, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

Interpretation of the resulting process model

1. OR  MS  QS happen once and in this order.
2. The Assembly/Inline-QC loop  
   *starts with one Assembly (AS)* and may iterate any number of times  
   (IQC  AS  IQC  AS  …); the loop is left when IQC deems the product
   satisfactory.
3. The Testing/Re-testing loop behaves analogously
   (at least one TST, followed by zero or more RT  TST pairs).
4. After a successful test the product is Packaged (PK).
5. Labeling is optional – the XOR gives the choice between performing LB or
   silently skipping it (tau branch).
6. Finally Distribution Planning (DP) must precede Dispatch (D).

There are no additional precedence constraints, so any activities that are not
linked by an “order” arc are, by definition, allowed to occur concurrently;
in this concrete model all arcs form one straight chain, meaning the execution
is sequential while still permitting the repetitions and the optional step
captured by the operators.
