Here is a POWL model that captures the observed process, including the core flow, the IQC looping, the TST/RT re-testing loop, and the optional labeling step LB before packaging.

Rationale (brief)
- Core sequential flow: OR -> MS -> QS -> AS
- IQC is a loop with AS: LOOP(AS, IQC) to model zero-or-more interleavings AS, IQC, AS, IQC, ...
- TST is followed by possible RT re-testing: LOOP(TST, RT) to capture TST, RT, TST, RT, ... until exit to packaging
- After PK, LB is optional before DP. This is modeled as a XOR after PK with two branches:
  - Branch with LB then DP then D
  - Branch with DP then D
- The final D is included in both branches, ensuring it occurs after DP in all paths.

Python-like construction (pm4py objects)

from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Primitive activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")  # optional
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D  = Transition(label="D")

# IQC-AS loop: AS -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> ... (exit after an AS to next stage)
loop_as_iqc = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])

# TST-RT loop: TST -> RT -> TST -> RT -> ... (exit after a TST to next stage)
loop_tst_rt = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Optional LB before DP: two branches after PK
# Branch 1: LB -> DP -> D
path_with_lb = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[LB, DP, D])
path_with_lb.order.add_edge(LB, DP)
path_with_lb.order.add_edge(DP, D)

# Branch 2: DP -> D (LB skipped)
path_without_lb = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DP, D])
path_without_lb.order.add_edge(DP, D)

# XOR between the two LB-branches
xor_after_pk = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[path_with_lb, path_without_lb])

# Root partial order: sequential flow OR -> MS -> QS -> loop_as_iqc -> loop_tst_rt -> PK -> xor_after_pk
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, loop_as_iqc, loop_tst_rt, PK, xor_after_pk])
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, loop_as_iqc)
root.order.add_edge(loop_as_iqc, loop_tst_rt)
root.order.add_edge(loop_tst_rt, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, xor_after_pk)

Notes
- LB is modeled inside the XOR as optional branching after PK; all observed cases are represented (LB present or skipped).
- IQC and RT appear as loops using LOOP operators to reflect their repeated nature.
- The final activity D is included within both branches after DP, ensuring D is the last step in all observed paths.
