# Silent transition for optional skip (e.g., if no D&R is needed)
skip_debug = SilentTransition()

# Step 2: Create the loop structure (BNC followed by optional D&R)
# Loop: BNC -> (D&R or exit)
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[base_network_config, debug_reconfigure]
)

# Step 3: Create the exclusive choice between CD and MD
xor_deployment = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[containerized_deployment, monolithic_deployment]
)

# Step 4: Create the partial order for final QA and SA
# Both QA and SA must complete before GLA, but can run in parallel
final_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[quality_assurance, security_audit, go_live_approval])

# Add partial order constraints:
# - QA and SA must both be completed before GLA
final_tasks.order.add_edge(quality_assurance, go_live_approval)
final_tasks.order.add_edge(security_audit, go_live_approval)

# Step 5: Build the main partial order of the entire process

# Root structure: 
# 1. SR -> CS (CS is mandatory before technical setup)
# 2. After CS: DA and ACI run in parallel
# 3. After DA and ACI: enter the loop (BNC -> D&R loop)
# 4. After loop: choose between CD or MD
# 5. After deployment: QA and SA in parallel, then GLA

# First, build the initial partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        service_request,
        contract_setup,
        datacenter_allocation,
        access_control_init,
        loop_config,
        xor_deployment,
        quality_assurance,
        security_audit,
        go_live_approval
    ]
)

# Define the execution order constraints:

# 1. SR must be completed before CS
root.order.add_edge(service_request, contract_setup)

# 2. CS must be completed before DA and ACI
root.order.add_edge(contract_setup, datacenter_allocation)
root.order.add_edge(contract_setup, access_control_init)

# 3. DA and ACI have no order constraint — they are concurrent
# (already handled by being unconnected in partial order — no edge added)

# 4. After DA and ACI, the loop must start
# So: DA and ACI must complete before the loop starts
root.order.add_edge(datacenter_allocation, loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(access_control_init, loop_config)

# 5. The loop must complete before deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, xor_deployment)

# 6. After deployment, QA and SA must happen before GLA
# (already defined in final_tasks, and now connected to root)

# Connect QA and SA to the deployment step
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, quality_assurance)
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, security_audit)

# Final note: GLA only after QA and SA, which is already enforced via edges above

# Optional: We can also ensure that the loop can terminate after BNC (i.e., D&R is optional)
# The loop structure (Operator.LOOP) handles this naturally — it allows execution of A, then either exit or B, then A again.

# Final model: root is the top-level POWL model representing the entire process

# Return the constructed POWL model
root

###  Explanation of Key Design Decisions:

- **Partial Order**: Used to represent concurrency and dependencies. Tasks like DA and ACI are concurrent (no edge), while others (e.g., SR  CS) are sequential.
- **Loop (LOP)**: The `loop_config` represents repeated attempts at configuration. After BNC, if issues exist, D&R runs; otherwise, the loop exits. The loop structure allows multiple iterations until stable.
- **Exclusive Choice (XOR)**: After the loop, only one of CD or MD is chosen — modeled via `Operator.XOR`.
- **Final Tasks**: QA and SA are both required before GLA, and they can run in parallel — this is captured by adding edges from deployment to both QA and SA, and from QA/SA to GLA.
- **Silent Transition**: Not needed in this scenario (no skipped activity), but included as a placeholder in case of future extension.

This model faithfully captures the telecom service provisioning process with all required concurrency, loops, and choices, using the standard POWL constructs from `pm4py`. It is ready to be used in process mining, simulation, or analysis tools that support POWL.
