Here is the Python code to represent the complex digital service provisioning process using POWL:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions for each activity
SR = Transition(label="Service Request")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
D_R = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Setup loop for BNC and D&R
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# Setup exclusive choice for deployment method
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Create partial orders for initial and final steps
initial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])
initial_order.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# Parallel tasks for DA and ACI
parallel_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
# No order needed as they are concurrent

# After loop, partial order for deployment choice
post_loop_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, deployment_choice])
post_loop_order.order.add_edge(loop, deployment_choice)

# Partial order for QA, SA, and GLA
final_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA, GLA])
final_order.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
final_order.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Combine all parts into the main POWL model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    initial_order, parallel_tasks, post_loop_order, final_order
])

# Connect parts in the main order
root.order.add_edge(initial_order, parallel_tasks)
root.order.add_edge(parallel_tasks, post_loop_order)
root.order.add_edge(post_loop_order, final_order)

# Add edges for dependencies within sub-orders
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)
```

### Explanation:

- **Transitions**: Each activity in the process is defined as a `Transition` or `SilentTransition`. Here, only `Transition` is used since all activities have labels.

- **Loop**: The `OperatorPOWL` with `LOOP` operator is used to represent the loop between `BNC` and `D&R`.

- **Exclusive Choice**: An `OperatorPOWL` with `XOR` operator defines the choice between containerized or monolithic deployment.

- **Partial Orders**: 
  - `initial_order` ensures `CS` happens after `SR`.
  - `parallel_tasks` represents the concurrent execution of `DA` and `ACI`.
  - `post_loop_order` links the loop to the deployment choice.
  - `final_order` sets up the dependencies for `QA`, `SA`, and `GLA`.

- **Main Order**: The root `StrictPartialOrder` combines all sub-orders and ensures the overall workflow dependency is maintained as described in the scenario.

This POWL model accurately represents the complex scenario with all the necessary dependencies, concurrency, loops, and choices.
