### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

This foundational step involves creating a single, unified view of your operations from disparate data sources.

#### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**

The first task is to construct a cohesive event log. This involves an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process:

*   **Case ID:** We will use the `Vehicle-Day` (e.g., 'V12-20241205') as the primary `Case ID`. This treats each vehicle's daily shift as a single end-to-end process instance, which is perfect for analyzing a full delivery cycle.
*   **Activity:** We will standardize event types into a clear set of activities. For example:
    *   `'Start Shift', 'Route Assigned'` -> **Depot Prep**
    *   `'Depart Depot'` to `'Arrive Customer'` (using GPS data) -> **Travel to Customer**
    *   `'Arrive Customer'` to `'Depart Customer'` -> **Customer Service Stop**
    *   `'Delivery Success'` / `'Delivery Failed'` -> These will be attributes of the `Customer Service Stop`.
    *   Periods of low speed from GPS data between service stops -> **Traffic Delay**
    *   `'Unscheduled Stop'` from GPS/Maintenance Logs -> **Unscheduled Maintenance Stop**
    *   `'Arrive Depot'` to `'End Shift'` -> **Depot Return & Closeout**
*   **Timestamp:** This is the primary ordering attribute. We will ensure all timestamps are in a consistent format and timezone (UTC is standard practice).
*   **Attributes:** We will enrich the log with contextual data such as `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Package ID` (for specific deliveries), `Location`, `Speed`, and planned vs. actual stop sequence numbers.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
*   **Data Correlation:** Linking a GPS `Unscheduled Stop` to a maintenance log entry requires correlating timestamps and `Vehicle ID`.
*   **Event Granularity:** GPS data is high-frequency, while scanner data is milestone-based. We will use GPS data to define `Travel` and `Idle` states, and scanner data to define the purpose of a stop (e.g., `Customer Service Stop`).
*   **Inconsistent Timestamps:** A driver might press 'Arrive Customer' after finding parking, not upon arrival. We will use the GPS signal stopping at the location as the true "arrival" and the scanner data to define the start of the "service" phase. This allows us to separate *parking time* from *customer interaction time*.

#### **Process Discovery**

Using an algorithm like the Inductive Miner, we will generate a process map from the event log. This map will visually represent what *actually* happens in your daily operations. Instead of a simple, linear plan, it will likely reveal:
*   The **"happy path"**: The most common sequence of activities (e.g., Depot Prep -> Travel -> Service Stop -> ... -> Return to Depot).
*   **Deviations**: Loops where drivers backtrack to re-attempt deliveries.
*   **Alternative Paths**: Routes that include unscheduled maintenance stops or long, unplanned breaks.
*   **Parallel Activities**: If multiple packages are delivered at a single large complex, we can visualize this.

#### **Conformance Checking**

We will compare the discovered process model (the "as-is") against the planned routes from your dispatch system (the "to-be"). This will immediately highlight critical deviations:
*   **Sequence Deviations:** Are drivers visiting stops out of the planned order? This can have a cascading effect on all subsequent delivery time windows.
*   **Unplanned Stops (Extra Activities):** The process map will clearly show any stops that were not in the dispatch plan, such as unscheduled breaks or vehicle issues.
*   **Skipped Stops (Missing Activities):** Were any planned deliveries missed entirely during the shift?
*   **Timing Deviations:** We can flag any `Travel` or `Service Stop` activity that takes significantly longer (e.g., >25%) than the time allocated in the dispatch plan. This is a primary indicator of inaccurate planning or unforeseen issues.

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

With a discovered process model, we can overlay performance data to see *where* the process is slow and costly.

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

We will calculate the following KPIs directly from the event log:
*   **On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate:** `COUNT(Deliveries where 'Delivery Success' timestamp is within customer time window) / COUNT(Total Successful Deliveries)`.
*   **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** `AVG('Depart Customer' timestamp - 'Arrive Customer' timestamp)`. This is the "service time".
*   **Travel vs. Service Time Ratio:** `SUM(All Travel Durations) / SUM(All Service Durations)`. A high ratio suggests inefficient routing or traffic issues.
*   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** `(Shift Duration - Depot Idle Time - Unscheduled Downtime) / Shift Duration`.
*   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** `COUNT('Delivery Failed') / COUNT('Delivery Failed' + 'Delivery Success')`.
*   **Average Fuel Consumption per Delivery:** By correlating `Vehicle ID`, distance traveled (from GPS), and idle times with known fuel consumption rates for each vehicle model.
*   **Frequency and Duration of Traffic Delays:** By analyzing the duration of all `Traffic Delay` activities, we can quantify the total time lost to congestion.

#### **Identifying Bottlenecks**

We will use the following techniques:
*   **Performance-Enhanced Process Map:** We will color-code the process map to show average durations. Activities (boxes) and transitions (arrows) that are "red" (i.e., take the most time) are your primary bottlenecks. We might discover that `Depot Prep` in the morning or `Travel` during afternoon rush hour are major time sinks.
*   **Activity-Level Analysis:** We will create dashboards to analyze the duration of key activities. For example, a histogram of `Customer Service Stop` times might reveal a long tail, indicating that a small number of stops take an excessively long time. We can then drill down to see if this is due to apartment buildings, business deliveries, or specific drivers.
*   **Resource and Variant Analysis:** By filtering the process map by `Driver ID`, `Vehicle ID`, or `Route ID`, we can compare performance. We may find that certain drivers are consistently faster, or that older vehicles are more prone to long `Unscheduled Maintenance Stops`, directly quantifying their financial and operational impact.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

Identifying bottlenecks is the first step; understanding *why* they occur is the key to solving them.

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
    *   **Analysis:** We will use **variant analysis** to compare the process models of the top 10% most punctual routes vs. the bottom 10%. Do the inefficient routes show more "spaghetti-like" patterns, with backtracking and crisscrossing paths?
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** If the planned routes look logical on a map but the executed routes are chaotic, it points to a disconnect between planning and reality.

*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
    *   **Analysis:** We will compare the planned travel time from the dispatch system with the actual travel time calculated from the event log for thousands of route segments. We can plot this difference by time of day and location.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** If actual travel times are consistently 50% higher than planned times between 4 PM and 6 PM in the city center, it confirms that the planning system's traffic model is inadequate.

*   **Impact of Vehicle Breakdowns:**
    *   **Analysis:** We will filter the entire event log for cases containing the `Unscheduled Maintenance Stop` activity. We will then analyze the impact these cases have on OTD and overtime for that day.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** By correlating these events with `Vehicle ID` and maintenance logs, we can determine if breakdowns are linked to vehicle age, model, or a lack of preventative servicing.

*   **High Variability in Service Time:**
    *   **Analysis:** We will analyze the duration of the `Customer Service Stop`. We can then correlate long service times with attributes like location type (e.g., high-rise apartment vs. suburban house), time of day, or package size.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** If service times at apartment buildings are consistently 3x longer, the root cause is likely time spent finding parking, accessing the building, and using elevators, not inefficient drivers.

*   **Impact of Failed Deliveries:**
    *   **Analysis:** We will analyze the process flow *following* a `Delivery Failed` event.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** If a failed delivery consistently leads to a 30-minute re-routing loop later in the day, causing a cascade of late deliveries for subsequent stops, we can quantify the full "cost" of that single failure.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Based on the root cause analysis, we propose the following concrete, data-driven strategies:

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic and Historically-Informed Route Optimization**
*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Suboptimal routes and inaccurate travel time estimates.
*   **Root Cause:** Static routing plans that don't account for predictable traffic patterns and service time variations.
*   **Data-Driven Proposal:** Use the process mining insights to enrich your dispatch system.
    1.  Create a **historical traffic model** by mapping the average actual travel times for every key road segment by time of day.
    2.  Develop **service time archetypes** based on location type (e.g., "Suburban House: 3 min", "Downtown Office: 7 min", "High-Rise Apt: 10 min").
    3.  Feed this enriched data into your routing engine to generate smarter, more realistic route plans. For real-time optimization, integrate a live traffic API and re-route drivers mid-shift if a major delay is detected on their planned path.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Improved OTD Rate, reduced Travel Time vs. Service Time ratio, lower fuel costs, and less driver overtime.

#### **Strategy 2: Proactive Failed Delivery Reduction Program**
*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** High rate of failed deliveries and costly re-delivery attempts.
*   **Root Cause:** Poor communication and misalignment of delivery time with customer availability.
*   **Data-Driven Proposal:**
    1.  Analyze variants leading to `Delivery Failed`. Identify if failures are more common in specific neighborhoods, for certain time windows, or for customers who have not responded to notifications.
    2.  Implement a tiered communication strategy. For deliveries identified as "high-risk" of failure, automatically send a more proactive notification (e.g., "Your driver, [Name], is 3 stops away. Track them here: [link]").
    3.  Offer customers an easy, one-click option to reschedule or authorize leaving the parcel in a safe place if they won't be home.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Drastically reduced Rate of Failed Deliveries, lower re-delivery operational costs, and improved customer satisfaction.

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**
*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Unscheduled vehicle downtime during shifts.
*   **Root Cause:** Reactive, mileage-based maintenance schedules that don't account for actual operational strain.
*   **Data-Driven Proposal:**
    1.  Using the event log, build a "Vehicle Strain Score" for each van based on factors like total daily operating hours, time spent idling in traffic (which is hard on engines), and number of starts/stops.
    2.  Correlate historical `Unscheduled Maintenance Stop` events with this strain score.
    3.  Build a predictive model that flags vehicles for preventative maintenance when their strain score crosses a critical threshold, even if they haven't reached their next mileage-based service interval.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Reduced frequency of costly in-shift breakdowns, improved Vehicle Utilization Rate, and a shift from expensive reactive repairs to cheaper preventative maintenance.

### 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

Our recommendations are designed to be practical and sustainable within your operational reality.

#### **Accounting for Constraints**
*   **Dynamic Routing** will always operate within the constraints of maximum legal driver hours and vehicle parcel capacity. The algorithm's goal will be to optimize *within* these hard limits.
*   **Customer Time Windows** will be treated as a primary constraint in any route optimization, ensuring that improved efficiency does not come at the cost of service level agreements (SLAs).
*   **Driver Acceptance:** We must present these changes as tools to make drivers' jobs easier (e.g., more realistic schedules, fewer frustrating re-deliveries), not as a "big brother" monitoring system.

#### **Continuous Monitoring Plan**
Implementation is not the end. We will establish a continuous monitoring framework using process mining dashboards:
*   **KPI Dashboard:** Tracks our key metrics (OTD, Cost per Delivery, Failed Delivery Rate) week-over-week to measure the direct impact of our changes.
*   **Conformance Dashboard:** Monitors the adherence to the new, optimized routes. Are drivers following the new plans? If not, why? This provides immediate feedback.
*   **Bottleneck Alert System:** An automated monitor that flags any activity (e.g., `Service Stop` at a new warehouse) or route that begins to consistently exceed its expected duration, allowing for proactive investigation before it becomes a major problem.

By adopting this continuous improvement loop, Speedy Parcels can remain agile, efficient, and responsive to the ever-changing demands of the last-mile logistics landscape.
