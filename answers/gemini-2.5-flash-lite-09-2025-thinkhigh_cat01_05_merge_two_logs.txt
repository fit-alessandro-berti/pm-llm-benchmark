This integration process involves mapping events between Log A (System A) and Log B (System B) using `order_id` as the key and applying a time tolerance of $\pm 2$ seconds for matching.

## Integration Reasoning and Decision Log

The following mapping decisions were made based on the provided logs:

1.  **Matching Tolerance & Timing:** A strict tolerance of $\pm 2$ seconds was applied to match events from Log A and Log B.
2.  **Event Name Normalization:** For merged events, we generally prioritized the event name from Log A (the primary timeline) but included the corresponding attribute (`event_name`) from Log B for completeness.
3.  **Attribute Merging:** All attributes from both logs are combined into the unified record. Log A's timestamp is used as the primary time reference for sorting merged events, except where Log B's event precedes Log A's event by less than 2 seconds (in which case, Log A's time is still used for sorting consistency relative to Log A's flow).
4.  **Non-Matches/Separations:**
    *   **Payment Conflict:** The event `Payment Processed` (Log A @ 10:02:00Z) and `PaymentCheck` (Log B @ 10:02:05Z) differed by 5 seconds, exceeding the 2-second tolerance. Although contextually related, they were treated as **separate events** to maintain confidence in the match criteria.
    *   **Unique Events:** Events found exclusively in one log (`Item Delivered` from A, `Quality Check` from B) were included as is, noting their origin.

### Specific Event Matches:

| Log A Time | Log A Event | Log B Time | Log B Event | Match Confidence | Resulting Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 10:00:00Z | Order Received | 09:59:58Z | OrderReceived | High (2s difference) | **Merged** |
| 10:01:30Z | Order Validated | 10:01:29Z | OrderValidation | High (1s difference) | **Merged** |
| 10:02:00Z | Payment Processed | 10:02:05Z | PaymentCheck | Low (5s difference) | **Kept Separate** |
| 10:05:00Z | Item Shipped | 10:05:02Z | Shipping | High (2s difference) | **Merged** |
| 10:20:00Z | Item Delivered | N/A | N/A | N/A | **Kept Separate (Log A only)** |
| N/A | N/A | 10:03:00Z | Quality Check | N/A | **Kept Separate (Log B only)** |

## Integrated Event Log (Chronologically Ordered)

The final log is sorted primarily based on the timestamp established for that record (Log A's timestamp for merged events, or the native timestamp for unique events).

| Primary Timestamp (Z) | Source Logs | Event Type (A) | Event Name (B) | Order ID | User ID | Resource ID | Notes/Metadata |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2023-10-10T10:00:00Z** | A & B | Order Received | OrderReceived | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | Event captured at warehouse system |
| **2023-10-10T10:01:30Z** | A & B | Order Validated | OrderValidation | Order#1234 | u12 | r10 | Cross-check inventory |
| **2023-10-10T10:02:00Z** | A Only | Payment Processed | N/A | Order#1234 | N/A | N/A | Event solely recorded by System A. |
| **2023-10-10T10:02:05Z** | B Only | N/A | PaymentCheck | Order#1234 | u12 | r99 | Payment gateway delay |
| **2023-10-10T10:03:00Z** | B Only | N/A | Quality Check | Order#1234 | u45 | r11 | Random inspection |
| **2023-10-10T10:05:00Z** | A & B | Item Shipped | Shipping | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | Package handed to courier |
| **2023-10-10T10:20:00Z** | A Only | Item Delivered | N/A | Order#1234 | N/A | N/A | Event solely recorded by System A. |
