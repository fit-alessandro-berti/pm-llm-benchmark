I can provide you with a list of potential questions related to the given process, along with their proposed confidence scores based on the data provided.

**Process-related questions**

1. What is the frequency of each stage in the process?
	* Confidence score: 0.85
2. How many stages are involved in each process variant (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE to Payment Handled)?
	* Confidence score: 0.73
3. Can you estimate the average time taken for each stage in the process?
	* Confidence score: 0.68
4. What is the performance metric (frequency and/or percentage) for Request Payment in each process variant?
	* Confidence score: 0.83
5. How often do payments fail to be handled according to the process variants?

**Stage-specific questions**

6. What is the frequency of a request being submitted by an employee versus approved by administration? Is there a difference in performance?
	* Confidence score: 0.82
7. Can you identify which stages are missing from each process variant (e.g., PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER)?
	* Confidence score: 0.84
8. How often do payments being handled by the process variants fail to be approved by administration?
	* Confidence score: 0.76

**Stage performance metrics**

9. What is the average time taken for a request to be submitted by an employee in each process variant?
	* Confidence score: 0.80
10. Can you calculate the mean performance metric (frequency and/or percentage) for Request Payment in each process variant?
	* Confidence score: 0.85

**Confidence scores**

Please note that confidence scores are subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives and expertise. These values are intended to provide a general indication of uncertainty.
