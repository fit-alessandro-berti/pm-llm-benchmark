Certainly! Here is a structured textual BPMN-like process model derived from the interview excerpts, capturing **tasks/activities, sequence flows, gateways/decision points, roles/participants, artifacts, exceptions**, and **variations**. This description provides detailed instructions suitable for translation into a visual process diagram.

## **BPMN-like Process Model: Invoice Approval Workflow**

---

### **Participants/Roles:**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)**
- **Purchasing Officer**
- **Department Manager**
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (AP Supervisor)**
- **Supplier Relationship Manager**
- **Supplier** (External)

### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
- **Invoice** (received via email, possibly with/without PO Number)
- **Purchase Order (PO)**
- **Goods/Services Receipt Confirmation**
- **Discrepancy Clarifications/Supporting Documents**
- **System Notifications/Emails**
- **Payment Schedule**

---

### **Process Flow:**

#### **1. Invoice Receipt**
- **Start Event:** Invoice received by **AP Clerk** (typically via email).

#### **2. PO Number Check (AP Clerk)**
- **Activity:** Check if Invoice contains valid PO number.

  - **Gateway (Exclusive): PO Present?**
    - **Yes  Continue**
    - **No  Exception Handling**
      - **2a. AP Clerk returns invoice to Supplier requesting PO/information. (Email)**
      - **Wait for Supplier response**
      - **On receipt of correct invoice, return to Step 2.**

---

#### **3. Log Invoice (AP Clerk)**
- **Activity:** Log invoice with PO into accounting system.

#### **4. Forward Invoice for Receipt Confirmation (AP Clerk)**
- **Activity:** Forward invoice and PO to **Purchasing Officer** for receipt confirmation.

---

#### **5. Receipt and PO Match Check (Purchasing Officer)**

- **Activity:** Compare invoice with PO:
  - Quantities, Prices, Delivery Charges, PO Reference, Receipt of Goods/Services

- **Gateway (Exclusive): Invoice/PO/Receipt Match?**
  - **Yes  Confirmation**
    - **5a. Purchasing Officer sends confirmation email to AP Clerk**
    - **Proceed to Step 6.**
  - **No  Exception Handling**

---

#### **6. Exception Handling for Discrepancies (Collaborative)**
- **Activity:** If discrepancy or issue (missing/incorrect PO, pricing error, unreceived goods):

  - **6a. AP Clerk or Purchasing Officer holds invoice and reaches out to:**
    - **Supplier** (via Supplier Relationship Manager and/or direct contact)
    - **AP Supervisor** (if discrepancy cannot be resolved quickly)
  - **6b. Supplier Relationship Manager liaises with supplier to resolve missing PO or pricing dispute, if needed.**

- **Gateway (Exclusive): Can discrepancy be resolved quickly?**
  - **Yes  Update invoice details/receive correct invoice, return to Step 3 or 5 as appropriate.**
  - **No  Escalate to AP Supervisor.**

---

#### **7. AP Supervisor Exception Resolution (AP Supervisor)**
- **Activity:**
  - Contact supplier, department heads, or Purchasing to resolve missing PO, informal/retrospective POs, or unreconciled discrepancies.

- **Gateway (Exclusive): Exception resolved?**
  - **Yes  Invoice re-enters normal flow at matching step (Step 5 or 3 as relevant).**
  - **No **
    - For unreconcilable cases: **Invoice is rejected and process ends for this item.**
    - For informal services: **Create retrospective PO (with department heads), then return to Step 3.**

---

#### **8. Invoice Matching and Manager Approval Trigger**
- **Activity (AP Clerk):** Once PO and receipt are confirmed, and invoice matched:
  - System triggers manager approval request (automated notification).

---

#### **9. Manager Approval (Department Manager)**
- **Activity:** Department Manager reviews invoice, PO, confirmation, and supporting data in the system.

- **Gateway (Exclusive): Manager Approval?**
  - **Approve  Invoice passes to AP Clerk for payment scheduling.**
  - **Reject  AP Clerk notified; invoice placed on hold for further investigation as per Step 6 (Exception Handling).**

---

#### **10. Schedule Payment (AP Clerk)**
- **Activity:** AP Clerk schedules invoice for payment in next payment run.

- **End Event:** Invoice is paid.

---

### **Exceptions and Variations**

- **If PO is missing/lost:**
  - AP Clerk or Purchasing Officer requests missing PO from Supplier (via Supplier Relationship Manager if needed).
  - AP Supervisor may coordinate creation of a retrospective PO with department head (for informal services).

- **If invoice has unreconcilable discrepancy (e.g., pricing mismatch, goods not delivered):**
  - Exception is escalated to AP Supervisor for resolution/decision.
  - Potential outcomes: corrected invoice, PO creation, or invoice rejection.

- **If Department Manager rejects invoice:**
  - Cycle returns to Exception Handling (Step 6); further investigation and corrections are made before resubmitting for approval.

- **Ambiguity:**
  - **In some accounts,** AP Clerk may “hold” the invoice for investigation instead of formal escalation, or Purchasing Officer may directly contact the supplier.
  - **Supplier Relationship Manager** may be involved only in cases with key suppliers or contractual ambiguity.

## **Structured Model (Textual for BPMN)**

```plaintext
1. Start Event: Invoice received (AP Clerk)

2. Activity: Check for valid PO number (AP Clerk)
   - [Gateway: Does invoice have PO number?]
     - No: Return invoice to Supplier requesting PO (AP Clerk), wait for correct invoice  [return to Start]
     - Yes: Proceed

3. Activity: Log invoice into accounting system (AP Clerk)

4. Activity: Forward invoice & PO to Purchasing Officer for receipt confirmation (AP Clerk)

5. Activity: Check invoice matches PO and goods/services received (Purchasing Officer)
   - [Gateway: Do invoice & PO/receipt match?]
     - No: Hold invoice, investigate discrepancy (AP Clerk / Purchasing Officer / Supplier Relationship Manager)
       - [Gateway: Is issue resolved quickly?]
         - Yes: Update invoice / PO and resume process at appropriate step
         - No: Escalate to AP Supervisor
           - [Gateway: Exception resolved?]
             - Yes: Resume normal flow at relevant step
             - No: Create retrospective PO (if possible) or reject invoice (End)
     - Yes: Confirm receipt and match (Purchasing Officer), send confirmation to AP Clerk

6. Activity: Match invoice to PO in system (AP Clerk)

7. Activity: Trigger department manager approval (system automatic notification)

8. Activity: Department Manager reviews and approves/rejects invoice
   - [Gateway: Approve?]
     - Yes: Proceed to payment scheduling
     - No: Return to Exception Handling (Step 5 / 6)

9. Activity: Schedule invoice for payment in next payment cycle (AP Clerk)

10. End Event: Invoice paid
```

- The process is cyclical for unresolved issues or rejected invoices.
