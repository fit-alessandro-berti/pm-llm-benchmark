### **Bias Analysis of Event Logs: Group A (Protected) vs. Group B (Unprotected)**

The event logs reveal **systematic bias** in the decision-making process, favoring **Group B (Unprotected Group)** over **Group A (Protected Group)**. Below is a detailed breakdown of how this bias manifests:

---

## **1. Key Differences Between Groups**
### **(A) Protected Group (Group A)**
- **LocalResident = FALSE** (Non-local applicants)
- **CommunityGroup = None** (No affiliation with recognized community groups)
- **No ScoreAdjustment** (Scores remain unchanged)
- **Final Decisions:**
  - P001 (720)  **Approved**
  - P002 (710)  **Rejected**
  - P003 (740)  **Approved**

### **(B) Unprotected Group (Group B)**
- **LocalResident = TRUE** (Local applicants)
- **CommunityGroup = "Highland Civic Darts Club"** (for U001 & U003)
- **ScoreAdjustment = +10 (Community Boost)** (for U001 & U003)
- **Final Decisions:**
  - U001 (720  **730**)  **Approved**
  - U002 (710)  **Rejected** (no adjustment)
  - U003 (695  **705**)  **Approved**

---

## **2. How Bias Manifests**
### **(A) Unequal Score Adjustments (Favorable Treatment for Group B)**
- **Group B (Unprotected) applicants affiliated with "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a **+10 score adjustment** ("Community Boost").
- **Group A (Protected) applicants receive no adjustments**, even if their scores are identical or higher.
- **Impact:**
  - **U001 (720  730)** and **U003 (695  705)** are **approved due to the +10 boost**, while **P002 (710, no boost) is rejected**.
  - This suggests that **Group B applicants with community ties are given an unfair advantage**, while **Group A applicants are held to a stricter standard**.

### **(B) Local Residency as a Hidden Advantage**
- **All Group B applicants are marked as `LocalResident = TRUE`**, while **Group A applicants are `LocalResident = FALSE`**.
- **Possible Implications:**
  - Local residents may be **perceived as lower-risk** (e.g., better credit history, stronger ties to the community).
  - Non-local applicants (Group A) may be **subject to stricter scrutiny** or **excluded from certain benefits** (e.g., no community boost).
- **Result:**
  - **Group B applicants start with an inherent advantage**, even before score adjustments.

### **(C) Community Group Affiliation as a Proxy for Favoritism**
- **Only Group B applicants are affiliated with "Highland Civic Darts Club"**, which triggers the **+10 score adjustment**.
- **Group A applicants have `CommunityGroup = None`**, meaning they **do not benefit from any score boosts**.
- **Potential Issues:**
  - The system **explicitly rewards membership in a specific community group**, which may **disproportionately exclude Group A**.
  - If "Highland Civic Darts Club" is **dominated by Group B**, this creates a **structural barrier** for Group A.
  - The adjustment is **not based on merit** but on **group membership**, which is a form of **indirect discrimination**.

### **(D) Disparate Impact on Final Decisions**
| CaseID | Group | Original Score | Adjusted Score | Decision | Reason for Approval/Rejection |
|--------|-------|----------------|----------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| P001   | A     | 720            | 720            | Approved | High score (no adjustment)    |
| P002   | A     | 710            | 710            | Rejected | Below threshold (no boost)    |
| P003   | A     | 740            | 740            | Approved | High score (no adjustment)    |
| U001   | B     | 720            | **730**        | Approved | **+10 Community Boost**       |
| U002   | B     | 710            | 710            | Rejected | No boost (no community ties)  |
| U003   | B     | 695            | **705**        | Approved | **+10 Community Boost**       |

- **P002 (Group A, 710) is rejected**, while **U003 (Group B, 695  705) is approved** due to the **+10 boost**.
- **U001 (720  730) is approved**, while **P001 (720, no boost) is only approved because their score was already high**.
- **This shows that Group B applicants with community ties are given a "second chance" at approval**, while Group A applicants are **held to a stricter, unadjusted standard**.

---

## **3. Types of Bias Identified**
### **(A) ** **Direct Discrimination (Explicit Bias)**
- The **+10 Community Boost** is **only applied to Group B** (local residents with community ties).
- This is a **clear case of disparate treatment**—Group A is **explicitly excluded** from a benefit that Group B receives.

### **(B) ** **Indirect Discrimination (Systemic Bias)**
- Even if the system does not **intentionally** discriminate, the **use of `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` as factors** leads to **disproportionate harm** to Group A.
- **Example:**
  - If "Highland Civic Darts Club" is **predominantly Group B**, then **Group A is systematically disadvantaged** by not having access to the same networks.

### **(C) ** **Algorithmic Bias in Scoring**
- The **Scoring Engine** applies adjustments **based on group membership rather than individual merit**.
- This violates the principle of **fairness in automated decision-making**, as **two applicants with the same score (e.g., 710) receive different outcomes** based on group affiliation.

---

## **4. Potential Legal & Ethical Implications**
- **Violation of Fair Lending Laws (e.g., U.S. Equal Credit Opportunity Act, EU Non-Discrimination Directives):**
  - The system **disproportionately harms a protected group** (Group A) by denying them benefits available to Group B.
- **Reinforcement of Structural Inequality:**
  - If Group A is **historically disadvantaged** (e.g., immigrants, minorities), this system **perpetuates exclusion**.
- **Lack of Transparency:**
  - Applicants in Group A **do not know they are being penalized** for not being local or part of a specific community group.

---

## **5. Recommendations to Mitigate Bias**
1. **Remove the `CommunityGroup` Adjustment**
   - If the **+10 boost** is not **objectively justified**, it should be **eliminated** to ensure fair treatment.
2. **Re-evaluate the Use of `LocalResident` as a Factor**
   - If residency status is **not directly relevant** to the decision (e.g., loan approval), it should **not be used** in scoring.
3. **Apply Score Adjustments Fairly**
   - If adjustments are necessary (e.g., for economic hardship), they should be **applied uniformly** to all groups, not just one.
4. **Conduct a Disparate Impact Analysis**
   - Test whether the current system **disproportionately harms Group A** and adjust thresholds accordingly.
5. **Increase Transparency**
   - Applicants should be **informed** about how their group status affects their score.

## **6. Conclusion**
The event logs **clearly demonstrate bias** in favor of **Group B (Unprotected Group)** through:
 **Unequal score adjustments** (only Group B gets +10 boosts).
 **Favoritism toward local residents** (Group B is all `LocalResident = TRUE`).
 **Community group affiliation as a proxy for advantage** (only Group B benefits from "Highland Civic Darts Club").
 **Disparate impact on final decisions** (Group A is rejected at a higher rate for equivalent scores).

This is a **textbook case of algorithmic discrimination**, where **group membership—not individual merit—determines outcomes**. Corrective measures should be taken to **ensure fairness and compliance with anti-discrimination laws**.
