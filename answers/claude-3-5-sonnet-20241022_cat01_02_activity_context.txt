I'll analyze the log and propose more contextually accurate activity names.

**Analysis of Recurring Activities:**

1. **"Verify Documents"** appears twice in cases C001 and C003:
   - First occurrence: Initial document verification
   - Second occurrence: Re-verification after updates/changes

2. **"Call Customer"** appears multiple times with different purposes:
   - For requesting missing documents
   - For account clarification
   - For confirmation of changes
   - For requesting customer return to branch

**Revised Event Log with Contextual Activity Names:**

```
| Case ID | Revised Activity Name           | Original Activity   |
|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| C001    | Submit Online Request          | Initiate Request  |
| C001    | Initial Document Verification  | Verify Documents  |
| C001    | Call - Request Missing Docs    | Call Customer     |
| C001    | Submit Additional Documents    | Submit Additional |
| C001    | Verify Updated Documents       | Verify Documents  |
| C001    | Issue Final Approval           | Approve Request   |

| C002    | Submit Online Request          | Initiate Request  |
| C002    | Initial Document Verification  | Verify Documents  |
| C002    | Call - Account Clarification   | Call Customer     |
| C002    | Process Account Adjustment     | Adjust Account    |
| C002    | Call - Confirm Changes         | Call Customer     |
| C002    | Issue Final Approval           | Approve Request   |

| C003    | Submit In-Branch Request       | Initiate Request  |
| C003    | Initial Document Verification  | Verify Documents  |
| C003    | Call - Return Request          | Call Customer     |
| C003    | Process Account Correction     | Adjust Account    |
| C003    | Verify Post-Adjustment Docs    | Verify Documents  |
| C003    | Issue Final Approval           | Approve Request   |
```

**Justification for Naming Choices:**

1. **Request Initiation:**
   - Changed to "Submit Online Request" vs "Submit In-Branch Request" based on channel (WebPortal vs BranchReception)

2. **Document Verification:**
   - "Initial Document Verification" for first checks
   - "Verify Updated Documents" or "Verify Post-Adjustment Docs" for subsequent checks after changes

3. **Customer Calls:**
   - Prefixed with "Call -" and added specific purpose:
   - "Request Missing Docs" when documents are incomplete
   - "Account Clarification" when discussing discrepancies
   - "Confirm Changes" for follow-up verification
   - "Return Request" for branch-specific scenario

4. **Account Changes:**
   - Distinguished between "Process Account Adjustment" (planned change) and "Process Account Correction" (fixing missing info)

5. **Approval:**
   - Changed to "Issue Final Approval" to better reflect the conclusive nature of the action

These renamed activities provide clearer context about:
- The channel of interaction (online/branch)
- The sequence of verification (initial/follow-up)
- The specific purpose of customer contact
- The nature of account modifications
- The finality of approval actions

This naming scheme makes it easier to understand the process flow and the specific purpose of each activity within its context.
