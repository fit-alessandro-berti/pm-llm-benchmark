Certainly! A hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process can be broken down into several activities. For instance:

- **A**: Initiate Purchase Request
- **B**: Approve Purchase Request
- **C**: Issue Purchase Order
- **D**: Receive Goods/Services
- **E**: Invoice Receipt
- **F**: Verify Invoice
- **G**: Approve Payment

Let's create a temporal profile for these activities. This profile will give us an idea of the average time between each activity and how much this time can vary (standard deviation).

Here is a possible temporal profile for the P2P process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('A', 'B'): (1440, 360), # Average: 1 day (1440 minutes), Standard Deviation: 6 hours (360 minutes)
    ('A', 'C'): (1560, 720), # Average: 1.08 days (1560 minutes), Standard Deviation: 12 hours (720 minutes)
    ('B', 'C'): (120, 30),   # Average: 2 hours (120 minutes), Standard Deviation: 0.5 hour (30 minutes)
    ('A', 'D'): (2880, 1440),# Average: 2 days (2880 minutes), Standard Deviation: 1 day (1440 minutes)
    ('B', 'D'): (2760, 1200),# Average: 1.9 days (2760 minutes), Standard Deviation: 2 hours (1200 minutes)
    ('C', 'D'): (2520, 1080),# Average: 1.75 days (2520 minutes), Standard Deviation: 1.8 hours (1080 minutes)
    ('A', 'E'): (3600, 1440),# Average: 2.5 days (3600 minutes), Standard Deviation: 1 day (1440 minutes)
    ('B', 'E'): (3480, 1200),# Average: 2.4 days (3480 minutes), Standard Deviation: 2 hours (1200 minutes)
    ('C', 'E'): (3360, 1080),# Average: 2.33 days (3360 minutes), Standard Deviation: 1.8 hours (1080 minutes)
    ('D', 'E'): (480, 240),  # Average: 8 hours (480 minutes), Standard Deviation: 4 hours (240 minutes)
    ('A', 'F'): (3720, 1560),# Average: 2.6 days (3720 minutes), Standard Deviation: 1 day (1560 minutes)
    ('B', 'F'): (3600, 1440),# Average: 2.5 days (3600 minutes), Standard Deviation: 1 day (1440 minutes)
    ('C', 'F'): (3480, 1200),# Average: 2.4 days (3480 minutes), Standard Deviation: 2 hours (1200 minutes)
    ('D', 'F'): (540, 270),  # Average: 9 hours (540 minutes), Standard Deviation: 4.5 hours (270 minutes)
    ('E', 'F'): (60, 30),    # Average: 1 hour (60 minutes), Standard Deviation: 0.5 hour (30 minutes)
    ('A', 'G'): (4800, 2160),# Average: 3.3 days (4800 minutes), Standard Deviation: 1 day (2160 minutes)
    ('B', 'G'): (4680, 1800),# Average: 3.25 days (4680 minutes), Standard Deviation: 3 hours (1800 minutes)
    ('C', 'G'): (4560, 1440),# Average: 3.2 days (4560 minutes), Standard Deviation: 1 day (1440 minutes)
    ('D', 'G'): (720, 360),  # Average: 12 hours (720 minutes), Standard Deviation: 6 hours (360 minutes)
    ('E', 'G'): (960, 480),  # Average: 16 hours (960 minutes), Standard Deviation: 8 hours (480 minutes)
    ('F', 'G'): (240, 120)   # Average: 4 hours (240 minutes), Standard Deviation: 2 hours (120 minutes)
}
```

In this profile:
- The times are expressed in minutes for ease of calculation.
- Each key-value pair represents a transition between activities with the associated average time and standard deviation.

For example, `('A', 'B'): (1440, 360)` means that on average it takes one day to go from initiating a purchase request (`A`) to approving it (`B`), but this can vary by up to six hours in either direction. 

This profile can help identify deviations and potential bottlenecks within the P2P process based on the defined threshold `ZETA`.
