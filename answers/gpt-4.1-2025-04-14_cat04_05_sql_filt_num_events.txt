Certainly! Here’s a **DuckDB SQL query** that returns all events for **only those cases with six or fewer events total**:

```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) filtered_cases
ON e.case_id = filtered_cases.case_id
;
```

**Explanation:**

- The subquery finds all `case_id`s with six or fewer events (`HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`).
- The main query joins this result with the `event_log` table, returning all events *only* for the allowed `case_id`s.
- This ensures cases with **more than six events** are excluded entirely.

Let me know if you need a version using `WHERE EXISTS` or other alternatives!
