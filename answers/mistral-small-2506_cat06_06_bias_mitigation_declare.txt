Here’s the updated `declare_model` with new constraints to mitigate bias, followed by a rationale for each addition:

### Updated `declare_model`:
```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},  # New: Ensure manual review exists
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # New: Ensure bias check exists
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # New: Manual review must coexist with minority approval
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}   # New: Manual review must coexist with minority rejection
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # New: Bias check must follow race check
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # New: Bias check must precede approval
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}    # New: Bias check must precede rejection
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # New: Prevent direct race check  rejection
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # New: Prevent direct gender check  rejection
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints:
1. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`**:
   - Ensures these activities are always part of the process, creating safeguards for sensitive decisions.

2. **Coexistence of `ManualReview` with `Approve_Minority`/`Reject_Minority`**:
   - Guarantees that decisions involving minority applicants are manually reviewed, reducing algorithmic bias.

3. **Response from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`**:
   - Ensures that race checks trigger a bias mitigation step, preventing immediate biased decisions.

4. **Succession of `BiasMitigationCheck` before `Approve`/`Reject`**:
   - Ensures decisions are only made after a bias check, adding a fairness layer.

5. **Non-succession from `CheckApplicantRace`/`CheckApplicantGender` to `Reject`**:
   - Prevents direct rejection based on sensitive attributes without intermediate checks, reducing discrimination risk.

These constraints collectively enforce fairness by:
- Introducing mandatory checks before decisions.
- Preventing direct links between sensitive attributes and adverse outcomes.
- Ensuring manual oversight for sensitive cases.
