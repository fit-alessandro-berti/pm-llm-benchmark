The main differences between these two processes variants seem to be:

1) The first variant has more frequent events than the second variant. For example, it has over double the number of `Application Rejected` and `Request Appointment` events as the second variant.

2) The second variant has a high frequency in some of its events - specifically, `Make Visit to Assess Colatteral` (439983.167), `Submit File to Underwriter` (439995.571), and `Sign Loan Agreement` (439937.000). This suggests that these events are more commonly performed in this variant.

3) The second variant has higher performance, which is calculated by dividing the number of occurrences by the total duration in seconds. Therefore, it is possible that this variant processes financial applications and loan approvals much faster than the first variant.

In general terms, this shows how the frequency (number of events per unit time) and performance (time spent on each event relative to its occurrence rate) can provide insights into the efficiency or throughput of a financial process.
