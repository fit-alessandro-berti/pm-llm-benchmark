Key ways bias shows up

- Community-based score boost:
  - The +10 (Community) adjustment is only applied when CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club” (and, in this log, only to LocalResident = TRUE cases).
  - This non-credit factor materially changes outcomes. Example: C004 is approved at 700 (after +10) while C003, with a higher unadjusted score of 715 but no community affiliation and not a local resident, is rejected.

- Differential effective thresholds by residency/affiliation:
  - Approvals at relatively low adjusted scores occur for locals with the community affiliation (C004 at 700; C001 at 720 after uplift).
  - A non-local without affiliation (C003) is rejected at 715, while a non-local with a much higher score (C005 at 740) is approved. This implies higher effective thresholds for non-locals and/or those without the community affiliation.

- Outcome disparities (from these 5 cases):
  - Local residents: 3/3 approved (100%).
  - Non-locals: 1/2 approved (50%).
  - Applicants with the specific CommunityGroup: 2/2 approved (100%), including one with the lowest adjusted score among approvals (700).
  - Counterfactual signal: If C003 had received the same +10 community uplift, they’d be 725 and likely would have been approved, suggesting the decision hinges on affiliation rather than underlying credit.

Why this matters for fairness and equity

- Applicants without local ties or specific community affiliations face higher effective bars to approval despite similar or better preliminary credit scores.
- CommunityGroup and LocalResident can act as proxies for geography and social capital, potentially correlating with protected characteristics (national origin, ethnicity, age, etc.), creating disparate impact even if not intended.
- The manual review did not mitigate the disparity; it preserved the uplift and resulting advantage.

What to change

- Remove or rigorously justify the community-based uplift:
  - Keep only if you can demonstrate strong, audited predictive value that is not proxying for protected traits and does not create disparate impact. Otherwise, eliminate it or replace it with neutral, credit-relevant factors (e.g., verified repayment history, stability of income).
- Use consistent decision thresholds:
  - Apply a single, publicly documented score threshold (or well-calibrated, fairness-audited segment thresholds) that does not depend on LocalResident or specific group membership.
- Monitor fairness:
  - Track approval rate, average adjusted score, false negative rate by LocalResident and by CommunityGroup; compute disparate impact ratio (e.g., approval odds for non-locals vs locals) and equal opportunity difference.
  - Run counterfactual tests (flip LocalResident/CommunityGroup while holding credit data constant) to detect direct dependence.
- Reviewer safeguards:
  - Blind reviewers to residency and club membership unless demonstrably necessary and justified; require justification when approving below standard thresholds.
- Applicant recourse:
  - Provide clear, actionable reasons for denial tied to credit factors, not community affiliation, so applicants know how to improve.

In short, the “+10 (Community)” adjustment and the apparent lower thresholds for local/affiliated applicants create a systematic advantage for those groups and disadvantage similarly creditworthy applicants without those affiliations or who are non-local.
