#### Assumptions & Notes  
1. “Finance System” is used as the actor for payment events because no human resource is identified in the Payments table.  
2. Orders can have multiple item-picking, delivery, invoice, and payment events; every record is kept as a separate event to preserve granularity.  
3. Order 1004 has not yet been shipped, invoiced, or paid as of 2024-01-15; only its creation and picking events appear.  
4. All timestamps are taken exactly from the source tables and kept in UTC to avoid time-zone inconsistencies.  
5. The log is already sorted chronologically within each case; most process-mining tools will re-sort globally if needed.
