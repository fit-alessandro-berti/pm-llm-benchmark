Below is the BPMN-like textual process model based on the provided interview excerpts, structured according to the requested components.

### **Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process

### **Roles/Participants:**
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)** - Mary
2. **Purchasing Officer** - Dan
3. **Department Manager** - Carlos
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor** - Rita
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager** - Karen
6. **Suppliers** (External)
7. **Accounting/System** (Implicit Participant for Automation)

### **Activities/Tasks:**

1. **Receive Invoice**
2. **Validate PO Number**
3. **Log Invoice in System**
4. **Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation**
5. **Confirm Goods/Service Receipt & Invoice Details**
6. **Match Invoice Against PO**
7. **Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate (if necessary)**
8. **Obtain Department Manager Approval**
9. **Schedule for Payment**
10. **Create Retrospective PO (if necessary)**
11. **Investigate & Resolve Exceptions (Supervisor/SMR)**
12. **Notify Supplier for Corrections (if necessary)**

### **Sequence Flow:**

1. **Start** --> **Receive Invoice** (AP Clerk)
   - **Trigger:** Invoice arrival (usually by email)
2. **Receive Invoice** --> **Validate PO Number** (AP Clerk)
   - **Condition:** PO Number Present
     - **Yes** --> **Log Invoice in System**
     - **No** --> **Notify Supplier for Corrections** --> **Receive Invoice** (Loop until PO validated)
3. **Log Invoice in System** --> **Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation** (AP Clerk to Purchasing Officer)
4. **Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation** --> **Confirm Goods/Service Receipt & Invoice Details** (Purchasing Officer)
   - **Condition:** All Details Correct
     - **Yes** --> **Match Invoice Against PO** (AP Clerk, implicitly after confirmation receipt)
     - **No** --> **Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate** (Purchasing Officer & AP Clerk)
       - **Escalation Condition:** Irresolvable Discrepancy
         - **Yes** --> **Investigate & Resolve Exceptions** (Rita/AP Supervisor & Karen/SMR)
         - **No** --> **Request Corrections from Supplier** --> **Receive Corrections & Re-validate**
5. **Match Invoice Against PO** --> **Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate** (if discrepancies found during matching, AP Clerk)
   - **Condition:** Match Successful
     - **Yes** --> **Obtain Department Manager Approval**
     - **No** --> **Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate**
6. **Obtain Department Manager Approval** --> **Schedule for Payment** (Department Manager to AP Clerk)
   - **Condition:** Approved
     - **Yes** --> **Schedule for Payment**
     - **No/Investigate** --> **Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate**
7. **Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate** (with **Investigate & Resolve Exceptions**) --> **Create Retrospective PO (if necessary)** (Rita) --> Rejoin main flow at **Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation** or **Schedule for Payment** depending on resolution
8. **Schedule for Payment** --> **End**

### **Gateways/Decision Points:**

1. **Validate PO Number**
   - **Gateway Type:** Exclusive (XOR)
   - **Conditions:** PO Number Presence
2. **Confirm Goods/Service Receipt & Invoice Details**
   - **Gateway Type:** Exclusive (XOR)
   - **Conditions:** Correctness of Invoice Details
3. **Match Invoice Against PO**
   - **Gateway Type:** Exclusive (XOR)
   - **Conditions:** Successful Match
4. **Obtain Department Manager Approval**
   - **Gateway Type:** Exclusive (XOR)
   - **Conditions:** Approval Outcome

### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**

- **Invoice Document**
- **Purchase Order (PO)**
- **System Notification for Approval**
- **Confirmation Email from Purchasing**
- **Discrepancy Resolution Documentation** (Implicit)
- **Retrospective PO Document** (if created)

### **Exceptions/Variations:**

1. **Missing PO Number:** Loop back to supplier for correction.
2. **Invoice Detail Discrepancies:**
   - Minor: Corrected with Purchasing/AP Clerk.
   - Major/Irresolvable: Escalated to Rita & Karen for resolution.
3. **Approval Rejection:** Investigated and resolved through the **Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate** path.
4. **Informal Service Contracts:** Handled by creating a **Retrospective PO**.

### **Textual BPMN-like Diagram Description for Conversion:**

```
StartEvent -> (Receive Invoice) [AP Clerk]
   -> (Validate PO Number) [Exclusive Gateway]
     -> Yes -> (Log Invoice in System) [AP Clerk]
          -> (Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation) [AP Clerk to Purchasing Officer]
               -> (Confirm Goods/Service Receipt & Invoice Details) [Purchasing Officer]
                    -> (Exclusive Gateway)
                       -> Yes -> (Match Invoice Against PO) [AP Clerk]
                               -> (Exclusive Gateway)
                                  -> Yes -> (Obtain Department Manager Approval) [Department Manager]
                                           -> (Exclusive Gateway)
                                              -> Yes -> (Schedule for Payment) [AP Clerk]
                                              -> No -> Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate
                               -> No -> Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate
                       -> No -> Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate
     -> No -> (Notify Supplier for Corrections) -> Loop to (Receive Invoice)

Resolve Discrepancies/Escalate [AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Rita, Karen]
   -> Investigate & Resolve Exceptions
   -> [Optional] Create Retrospective PO [Rita]
   -> Rejoin at appropriate step based on resolution

EndEvent
```

### **Noted Ambiguities/Uncertainties:**

1. **System Automation Details:** The exact automation triggers (e.g., how the system sends notifications) are not fully detailed.
2. **Loop Resolve Details:** Specifics on how corrections from suppliers are reintegrated into the process at exact steps could be clearer.
3. **Retrospective PO Integration:** The precise point at which a retrospective PO re-enters the main approval flow requires clarification.
