The pseudo-BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram you've provided outlines a structured process for handling customer requests, which can be either "Standard" or "Custom". Below, we'll walk through the process step by step, explaining each element in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of how this business workflow operates.

### **1. Start Event**

The process begins with a "Start Event", indicating that a new request has been received from a customer. This is essentially the initiation point for any request processing activity within the organization.

### **2. Task A: Receive Customer Request**

This task involves gathering all necessary information about the customer's request, such as product details, specifications, and any preferences they might have. It sets the stage for further evaluation in subsequent steps of the process.

### **3. Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**

An exclusive gateway (XOR) is used to make a decision based on a single condition that must be true for one path but not others. In this case, it checks whether the customer request is "Standard" or "Custom".

- If the request type is "Standard", the process follows Path B1.
- If the request type is "Custom", it takes the alternative Path B2.

### **Path A: Handling Standard Requests**

#### Task B1: Perform Standard Validation

For standard requests, this task involves performing routine validation checks to ensure that all provided information meets predefined criteria (e.g., budget limits, inventory availability). This helps in quickly identifying any immediate issues or mismatches with company policies.

#### Gateway (AND): Run Parallel Checks

This gateway represents a point where the process splits into multiple parallel paths that must be completed before proceeding. Here, two critical checks are performed concurrently:

- **Task C1: Credit Check** - Evaluates whether the customer has sufficient credit to proceed.
- **Task C2: Inventory Check** - Ensures that all requested items are available in stock.

#### All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)

Once both parallel tasks are completed successfully, this join point merges the paths back into a single flow. It ensures that no further action is taken until both checks have been finalized to maintain data integrity and operational reliability.

#### Task D: Calculate Delivery Date

Based on validated information and successful credit and inventory checks, this step calculates an estimated delivery date for the customer's order. This information is crucial for setting accurate expectations regarding product availability and shipment timelines.

### **Path B: Handling Custom Requests**

#### Task B2: Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis

Unlike standard requests, custom requests require a deeper analysis to assess feasibility based on unique specifications or requirements provided by the customer. This involves consulting with relevant departments (such as manufacturing or R&D) to determine if customization is viable.

### **Gateway (XOR): Is Customization Feasible?**

This exclusive gateway determines whether the requested customization can be achieved:

- If feasible, proceed to Task E1.
- If not feasible, send a rejection notice via Task E2 and terminate this path of the process with an "End Event".

#### Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation

For feasible custom requests, create a detailed quotation that outlines costs, timelines, materials, and any other relevant details specific to the customization. This step is essential for providing the customer with comprehensive information before proceeding further.

### **Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Needed?**

Regardless of whether the request was standard or custom (after successfully passing earlier steps), this gateway checks if managerial approval is necessary based on factors like order size, budget impact, or policy restrictions:

- If "Yes", proceed to Task F.
- If "No", skip directly to generating an invoice in Task G.

#### Task F: Obtain Manager Approval

For requests requiring managerial oversight, a designated manager reviews the proposal and either approves or rejects it based on company policies and strategic considerations. This step ensures that high-stakes decisions receive appropriate review and validation.

### **Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Granted?**

This decision point follows the approval task:

- If "Yes", move to Task G for invoice generation.
- If "No", initiate re-evaluation by looping back either to:
  - Task E1 in case of custom requests needing reassessment, or
  - Task D for standard paths requiring a new validation cycle.

### **Task H: Re-evaluate Conditions**

For non-approved requests (typically following managerial feedback), this step prompts the process to revisit earlier decision points. The loop mechanism ensures that either:

- Custom path reevaluates feasibility and prepares updated quotations, or
- Standard path returns for renewed validation checks before proceeding further.

### **Task G: Generate Final Invoice**

Once all conditions are met—including necessary approvals—this task generates a final invoice detailing the agreed-upon products/services, costs, delivery dates, and any other pertinent information. This serves as both an official record of the transaction and a bill sent to the customer for payment processing.

### **Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer**

Regardless of whether the request was standard or custom (and assuming it has been fully approved), this final task involves sending confirmation documentation to the customer. It typically includes order details, delivery timelines, payment information, and contact points for further inquiries or support needs.

The process concludes here with an "End Event", signaling that all steps have been completed successfully from start to finish.

### **Summary**

This pseudo-BPMN diagram effectively outlines a conditional workflow designed to handle different types of customer requests—standard versus custom—while incorporating critical checkpoints (like validations, feasibility analyses, credit and inventory checks), parallel processing paths for efficiency, decision points requiring managerial approvals where necessary, and mechanisms for re-evaluation when initial conditions aren't met. It's structured in such a way that ensures thoroughness, compliance with policy, customer satisfaction through clear communication, and operational flexibility to adapt based on the nature of each request received.
