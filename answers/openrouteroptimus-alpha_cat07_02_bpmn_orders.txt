Certainly! The visualization you provided is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram**, which depicts a multi-department workflow for processing a customer order within a company. Here's a structured description of the flow:

---

## **Lanes (Departments)**
The diagram is divided into four horizontal lanes, representing:
1. **Sales**
2. **Production**
3. **Procurement**
4. **Warehouse**

---

## **Process Flow Overview**

### **1. Sales**
- **Start (Monday morning):**
  - The process begins every Monday morning.
  - **Check order for completeness:** Sales receives and verifies an order.
  - **Check if customer exists in the database:** Decision gateway splits:
    - **If customer is NOT in the database**: Add customer to the database.
    - **If customer IS in the database:** Move to the next step.
  - **Send order details:** Once the order is validated, details are sent to **Production** and **Procurement**.
  - **Draft invoice:** An invoice is drafted after the product is sent from Warehouse.

---

### **2. Production**
- **Order details arrive:**
  - **Plan production:** Organize production based on order details.
  - **Check material status:** (Event-based gateway)
    - If **materials are not faulty:** Proceed to manufacturing.
    - If **materials are faulty:** (Loop to Procurement for materials compensation)
  - **Manufacture product:** Product is manufactured.
  - **Product complete:** Notify Warehouse.

---

### **3. Procurement**
- **Order details arrive:**
  - **Material Compensation Subprocess:**
    - **Order materials:** Materials are ordered.
    - **Check materials:** If faulty, materials are returned and reordered within the subprocess.
    - If order needs cancellation, the process can end here.
- **Send materials:** Notification sent to Production when materials are ready.

---

### **4. Warehouse**
- **Product complete:** Receives notification from Production.
- **Send product:** Ships the completed product to the customer.
- **Product sent:** Notifies Sales (for invoice drafting) and completes the process.

---

## **Key Features:**
- **Gateways/Decision Points:** Used to check customer existence and material quality.
- **Subprocess:** Procurement process has a loop for defective materials.
- **Dashed Arrows:** Indicate message flow between departments.
- **Solid Arrows:** Sequence flow within each department.

---

### **General Flow**
1. **Order is processed in Sales, verified, and entered if the customer is new.**
2. **Order details sent to both Production and Procurement.**
3. **Production and Procurement operate in parallel:**
   - Procurement ensures materials are ready and not faulty.
   - Production produces the product when everything is ready.
4. **Warehouse ships the completed product.**
5. **Sales drafts the invoice once the product ship notification is received.**

**Purpose:**  
This diagram helps visualize workflows, clarify responsibilities, and identify process improvements in a typical order fulfillment scenario across multiple departments.
