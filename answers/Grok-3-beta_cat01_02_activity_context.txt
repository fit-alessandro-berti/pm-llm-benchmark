Analysis of the Event Log
Upon analyzing the provided event log, I identified three activities that recur within individual cases but carry different contextual meanings based on their position in the workflow and the associated context: "Verify Documents", "Call Customer", and "Initiate Request" (though the latter only varies slightly across cases, not within them). Below, I outline the contextual differences and propose renamed activities to reflect these distinctions.
1. Recurring Activities and Contextual Differences
Verify Documents:
Appears multiple times in cases C001 and C003.
C001: First occurrence (09:20:00) is an initial identity check; second occurrence (10:30:00) is a re-verification after the customer submits additional documents.
C003: First occurrence (11:25:00) is an initial physical ID check at a branch; second occurrence (12:20:00) is a re-verification after an account adjustment.
C002: Only one occurrence (08:15:00), serving as an initial verification.
Call Customer:
Appears twice in cases C002 and once in C001 and C003.
C001: Single occurrence (09:45:00) to request missing documents due to incomplete verification.
C002: First occurrence (09:00:00) to clarify an account discrepancy; second occurrence (09:50:00) to confirm adjustments made.
C003: Single occurrence (11:50:00) to recall a walk-in customer who stepped out.
Initiate Request:
Appears once per case but differs slightly in context.
C001 & C002: Submitted via the web portal (customer-initiated online).
C003: Initiated in-person at a branch (staff-assisted).
2. Proposed Renamed Activities
Based on the contextual differences, I propose the following renamed activities:
Verify Documents:
"Initial Doc Verification" (first occurrence in a case).
"Re-Verify Documents" (subsequent occurrences after additional input or adjustments).
Call Customer:
"Request Info Call" (to request missing documents or clarify discrepancies).
"Recall Customer" (to bring a walk-in customer back to the branch).
"Confirm Adjustment Call" (to confirm changes made to the account).
Initiate Request:
"Online Request Submission" (via web portal).
"In-Person Request Initiation" (at a branch).

4. Justification of Naming Choices
"Initial Doc Verification" and "Re-Verify Documents":
The first "Verify Documents" in each case is an initial check (e.g., C001 at 09:20:00, C003 at 11:25:00), while subsequent occurrences involve re-checking after new information or adjustments (e.g., C001 at 10:30:00 after additional docs, C003 at 12:20:00 after account adjustment). "Initial" and "Re-Verify" distinguish the sequence and purpose.
"Request Info Call", "Recall Customer", and "Confirm Adjustment Call":
In C001 (09:45:00) and C002 (09:00:00), "Call Customer" seeks additional info or clarification, justifying "Request Info Call".
In C003 (11:50:00), the call is to bring the customer back, hence "Recall Customer".
In C002 (09:50:00), the call confirms changes, leading to "Confirm Adjustment Call". These names reflect the intent behind each call.
"Online Request Submission" and "In-Person Request Initiation":
C001 and C002 use the web portal (customer-driven), while C003 occurs at a branch (staff-assisted). "Online" vs. "In-Person" captures the channel, and "Submission" vs. "Initiation" subtly reflects the customer vs. staff role in starting the process.
These renamed activities enhance clarity, ensuring each stepâ€™s unique role in the workflow is unmistakable.
