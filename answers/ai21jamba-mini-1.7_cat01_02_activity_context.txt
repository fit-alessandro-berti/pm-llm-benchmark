### Justification of Renamed Activities

1. **Activity: Initiate Request**
	- **Contextual Change**: No change in naming as the activity consistently refers to the first step of initiating a support ticket.
2. **Activity: Submit Additional Documents**
	- **Contextual Change**: Renamed from "Submit Additional" to clarify the purpose of uploading documents as part of completing verification.
3. **Activity: Verify Documents**
	- **Contextual Changes**: Split into three distinct activities:
		- **Verify Documents**: First instance of document review.
		- **Follow-Up Verification**: Re-checking after additional submission.
		- **Re-Verify Documents**: Verification post-account adjustment at the branch.
4. **Activity: Call Customer**
	- **Contextual Changes**:
		- Call to clarify discrepancies in account details.
		- Follow-up call to confirm resolution of issues.
		- Outbound call to bring the customer back during a branch visit.
5. **Activity: Adjust Account**
	- **Contextual Change**: Renamed to "Adjust Account" for branch activities and "Internal Adjustment" for back-office corrections.
6. **Activity: Approve Request**
	- **Contextual Change**: No change, consistently refers to the final approval step.

### Benefits of Renaming

- **Clarity**: Each renamed activity reflects its specific purpose and context, avoiding confusion from generic names.
- **Process Flow**: The revised names align activities with their role in the broader workflow, enhancing traceability.
