To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps and construct a DuckDB SQL query accordingly. Here's how you can achieve each part of the task:

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

1. **Extract the ordered sequence of activities per case**:  
   Use `GROUP_CONCAT` to concatenate the activities for each `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp`.

2. **Group cases by their complete activity sequence and count the frequency of each variant**:  
   Group the results from Step 1 by the concatenated activity sequence and count the number of cases for each variant.

3. **Identify the top K variants by frequency**:  
   Use a `ROW_NUMBER` or `RANK` window function to rank the variants by their frequency and filter for the top K.

4. **Filter the original event log to include only cases belonging to the top K variants**:  
   Join the filtered list of `case_id`s from Step 3 back to the original `event_log` table to retrieve the corresponding events.

### **Final Query**

```sql
WITH ordered_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        GROUP_CONCAT(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(case_id) AS variant_frequency
    FROM ordered_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        variant_frequency,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_frequency DESC) AS variant_rank
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE variant_rank <= K  -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
),
top_k_cases AS (
    SELECT
        os.case_id
    FROM ordered_sequences os
    JOIN top_k_variants tkv
    ON os.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN top_k_cases tkc
ON el.case_id = tkc.case_id;
```

### **Explanation of the Query**

1. **`ordered_sequences` CTE**:  
   - For each `case_id`, concatenate the `activity` values in the order of their `timestamp` using `GROUP_CONCAT`.  
   - This creates a single string representing the activity sequence for each case.

2. **`variant_counts` CTE**:  
   - Group the results from `ordered_sequences` by `activity_sequence` and count the number of cases (`variant_frequency`) for each sequence.

3. **`ranked_variants` CTE**:  
   - Rank the variants by their frequency (`variant_frequency`) in descending order using `ROW_NUMBER`.

4. **`top_k_variants` CTE**:  
   - Filter the ranked variants to retain only the top K (replace `K` with the desired number).

5. **`top_k_cases` CTE**:  
   - Join `ordered_sequences` with `top_k_variants` to get the `case_id`s that belong to the top K variants.

6. **Final `SELECT`**:  
   - Join the original `event_log` with `top_k_cases` to retrieve all events for cases that belong to the top K variants.

### **Example**

For an `event_log` table with the following data:

| case_id | activity | timestamp           |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| 1       | A        | 2023-10-01 10:00:00 |
| 1       | B        | 2023-10-01 10:30:00 |
| 2       | A        | 2023-10-01 11:00:00 |
| 2       | C        | 2023-10-01 11:30:00 |
| 3       | A        | 2023-10-01 12:00:00 |
| 3       | B        | 2023-10-01 12:30:00 |

If `K = 1`, the query will return all events for cases with the most frequent variant (e.g., `A -> B`).

---

### **Notes**
- Replace `K` in the query with the desired number of top variants (e.g., `WHERE variant_rank <= 5` for the top 5 variants).
- Ensure the `timestamp` column is properly indexed for efficient sorting and grouping.
- Adjust the delimiter in `GROUP_CONCAT` (e.g., `' -> '`) as needed for readability.
