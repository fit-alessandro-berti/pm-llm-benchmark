### **Justifications for Naming Choices:**

1. **"Verify Documents"**: 
   - Renamed to:
     - "Initial Document Verification" for the first instance in all cases, as it reflects the initial check.
     - "Re-verify Updated Documents" or "Re-verify Documents Post-Adjustment" for subsequent instances, as they involve verifying updated or corrected documents.

2. **"Call Customer"**:
   - Renamed to:
     - "Request Missing Documents" in Case C001, where the call's purpose is explicitly to request additional information.
     - "Clarify Account Discrepancy" in Case C002, to highlight the issue being addressed during the call.
     - "Confirm Account Adjustment" in Case C002, for the follow-up to verify the outcome of the adjustment.
     - "Request Return to Branch" in Case C003, to describe the unique purpose of the call.

3. **"Initiate Request"**:
   - Renamed to:
     - "Submit Request via Web Portal" for cases initiated online.
     - "Submit Request at Branch" for walk-ins, emphasizing the different mode of initiation.

4. **"Adjust Account"**:
   - Renamed to:
     - "Perform Account Adjustment" to make it an action-oriented and specific term.

5. **"Submit Additional"**:
   - Renamed to:
     - "Upload Additional Documentation" to clarify the customer's role in providing requested information.

These naming choices ensure that the revised activity labels capture the contextual nuances of each action, making the log more interpretable and process-aware.
