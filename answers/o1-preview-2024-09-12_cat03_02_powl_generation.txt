Here is the Python code using `pm4py.objects.powl` to construct the POWL model for the described complex scenario:

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Base transitions
SR = Transition(label="SR")       # Service Request Verification
CS = Transition(label="CS")       # Contract Setup
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")     # Base Network Configuration
DR = Transition(label="D&R")      # Debug & Reconfigure
CD = Transition(label="CD")       # Containerized Deployment
MD = Transition(label="MD")       # Monolithic Deployment
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")     # Go-Live Approval

# Transitions for DA and ACI (can be executed concurrently)
DA = Transition(label="DA")       # Datacenter Allocation
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")     # Access Control Initialization

# Transitions for QA and SA (can be executed concurrently)
QA = Transition(label="QA")       # Quality Assurance
SA = Transition(label="SA")       # Security Audit

# Create the loop node between BNC and D&R
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Create the exclusive choice between CD and MD
choice_deployment = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Create partial order for DA and ACI (they can be done concurrently)
po_da_aci = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
# No edges between DA and ACI since they have no ordering constraints

# Create partial order for QA and SA (they can be done concurrently)
po_qa_sa = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
# No edges between QA and SA since they have no ordering constraints

# Now create the main partial order
nodes_main = [SR, CS, po_da_aci, loop_config, choice_deployment, po_qa_sa, GLA]
po_main = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_main)

# Add edges to represent the dependencies in the main partial order

# SR -> CS
po_main.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# CS -> po_da_aci (DA and ACI can start after CS is completed)
po_main.order.add_edge(CS, po_da_aci)

# po_da_aci -> loop_config (loop starts after both DA and ACI are completed)
po_main.order.add_edge(po_da_aci, loop_config)

# loop_config -> choice_deployment (after loop, choose between CD and MD)
po_main.order.add_edge(loop_config, choice_deployment)

# choice_deployment -> po_qa_sa (QA and SA start after deployment choice is completed)
po_main.order.add_edge(choice_deployment, po_qa_sa)

# po_qa_sa -> GLA (GLA can start after both QA and SA are completed)
po_main.order.add_edge(po_qa_sa, GLA)

# The POWL model 'po_main' now represents the entire process as described.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transitions**: We define all the individual tasks as `Transition` objects with their respective labels.

2. **Loop Node**: We create a `OperatorPOWL` object `loop_config` representing the loop between **Base Network Configuration (BNC)** and **Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)** using the `Operator.LOOP`.

3. **Exclusive Choice**: We create another `OperatorPOWL` object `choice_deployment` representing the exclusive choice between **Containerized Deployment (CD)** and **Monolithic Deployment (MD)** using the `Operator.XOR`.

4. **Partial Orders for Concurrent Tasks**:
   - For **Datacenter Allocation (DA)** and **Access Control Initialization (ACI)**, we create a `StrictPartialOrder` `po_da_aci` without any edges since they can be done concurrently.
   - For **Quality Assurance (QA)** and **Security Audit (SA)**, we create another `StrictPartialOrder` `po_qa_sa` without any edges for the same reason.

5. **Main Partial Order**: We build the main `StrictPartialOrder` `po_main`, including the initial tasks, the loop, the exclusive choice, and the final tasks.

6. **Dependencies**: We add edges to `po_main.order` to represent the dependencies:
   - **Service Request (SR)** must be completed before **Contract Setup (CS)**.
   - **Contract Setup (CS)** must be completed before both **DA** and **ACI** can start.
   - **DA** and **ACI** must both be completed before the looped configuration phase starts.
   - The looped configuration must be completed before the exclusive deployment choice.
   - The deployment choice must be completed before **QA** and **SA** can start.
   - Both **QA** and **SA** must be completed before **Go-Live Approval (GLA)**.

The constructed POWL model `po_main` now faithfully represents the complex digital service provisioning process as described in the scenario, using the appropriate POWL elements and structure.
