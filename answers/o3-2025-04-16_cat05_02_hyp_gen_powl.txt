1.  WHAT, EXACTLY, IS “WRONG” IN THE POWL MODEL?


A. Irregular loop between Evaluate (E) and Approve (P)  
   • The LOOP construct permits the sequence …E-P-E-P-… indefinitely.  
   • Depending on the loop semantics implemented in pm4py, it is also legal to exit the loop immediately after the first E, i.e. an evaluation without any approval.  
   • The model does not rule out the reverse order (P before an E in the next iteration), creating traces like R-A-E-P-P-E-C.

B. XOR with a silent branch around Notify (N)  
   • The XOR { N,  } means “Notify the customer OR silently skip it.”  
   • The process therefore tolerates legitimate executions that never inform the customer.

C. Partial-ordering that enables premature closing  
   • Constraint R  A and A  C exist, but there is **no** mandatory edge
     – loop  C, nor  
     – xor   C.  
   • Consequently the engine may emit C as soon as A finishes, leaving the claim without evaluation, approval, or notification.

D. Missing constraint “Approve after Evaluate”  
   • Although the children of the loop are listed [E, P], in a partial order this is not an enforced control-flow relation.  
   • A direct edge E  P is not present; P could therefore occur before the very first E if the execution engine interprets children as unordered.

E. Inconsistent customer journey  
   • A closed claim can simultaneously be “in loop” (evaluation still pending) if loop and C are executed in parallel because nothing prevents overlap.


2.  PLAUSIBLE REASONS THESE ANOMALIES CREPT IN


1. Incomplete migration of new business rules  
   – The company recently introduced “fast-track closures” for claims < $500.  
   – Modeller added edge A  C and a -branch in the XOR, but forgot to add a guard (claim_amount < 500).

2. Miscommunication between legal & IT  
   – Legal insisted “customer must be notified”, but IT interpreted that only certain regulatory regions require it, so they added a skip to keep the model generic.

3. Technical debt / copy-paste modelling  
   – LOOP (E,P) came from re-using a generic “review-rework” template even if the re-work cycle is not needed for simple claims.

4. Tool limitation  
   – Older modelling tool produced partial orders that lack explicit inter-child edges; the modeller assumed pm4py would infer E  P automatically.

5. Post-production hot-fix  
   – A production incident required urgent ability to force-close tickets; a direct A  C edge was inserted as a “temporary” emergency path and never removed.


3.  HOW TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES ON THE DATABASE


Below are concrete PostgreSQL queries (read-only) that look for evidence of the three main anomaly classes.

NOTE:  
• `ce` = alias for claim_events  
• Events are identified by `activity` column values “R”, “A”, “E”, “P”, “N”, “C”.  
• All timestamp comparisons use “<” or “>” on the same claim_id.

------------------------------------------------
3.1  Claims closed before evaluation or approval
------------------------------------------------
WITH events AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END)  AS t_close,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END)  AS t_eval,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END)  AS t_approve
  FROM   claim_events
  GROUP  BY claim_id
)
SELECT *
FROM   events
WHERE  t_close IS NOT NULL                           -- we have a close
  AND (t_eval  IS NULL OR t_close < t_eval)          -- never evaluated OR evaluated afterwards
  AND (t_approve IS NULL OR t_close < t_approve)     -- never approved  OR approved afterwards
ORDER  BY t_close;

 If rows are returned, the “premature close” path (A  C) is occurring.

------------------------------------------------
3.2  Multiple approvals or evaluations
------------------------------------------------
SELECT claim_id,
       SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS eval_count,
       SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approve_count
FROM   claim_events
GROUP  BY claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 1
    OR SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 1
ORDER BY claim_id;

 Evidence for the E-P loop repeating.

------------------------------------------------
3.3  Approval recorded before the first evaluation
------------------------------------------------
WITH ordered AS (
  SELECT claim_id, activity, timestamp,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id
                            ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq
  FROM   claim_events
  WHERE  activity IN ('E','P')
)
SELECT p.claim_id, p.timestamp AS first_P, e.timestamp AS first_E
FROM   ordered p
LEFT  JOIN ordered e
       ON  e.claim_id = p.claim_id
       AND e.activity = 'E'
       AND e.seq = 1
WHERE  p.activity = 'P'
  AND  p.seq = 1                      -- first relevant event is P
  AND (e.timestamp IS NULL OR p.timestamp < e.timestamp);

 Detects P occurring before any E.

------------------------------------------------
3.4  Skipped customer notification
------------------------------------------------
WITH notif AS (
   SELECT claim_id,
          bool_or(activity = 'N') AS has_notify,
          bool_or(activity = 'C') AS has_close
   FROM   claim_events
   GROUP  BY claim_id
)
SELECT *
FROM   notif
WHERE  has_close
  AND  NOT has_notify;    -- closed but never notified

 Quantify “silent branch” usage.

------------------------------------------------
3.5  Time-boxed loop frequency (optional KPI)
------------------------------------------------
WITH ep AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         activity,
         timestamp,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id, activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
  FROM   claim_events
  WHERE  activity IN ('E','P')
)
SELECT claim_id,
       MAX(rn) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') AS evaluations,
       MAX(rn) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS approvals
FROM   ep
GROUP  BY claim_id
ORDER  BY evaluations DESC;

 Shows how many evaluation/approval cycles each claim underwent.

------------------------------------------------
3.6  Correlate fast-track hypothesis (amount < $500)
------------------------------------------------
WITH premature AS (
  SELECT claim_id
  FROM   claim_events
  GROUP  BY claim_id
  HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END)
       <  MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END)
)
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_amount
FROM   claims c
JOIN   premature p USING (claim_id)
WHERE  c.claim_amount < 500;

 If many rows appear, the “fast-track closure” story is plausible.

------------------------------------------------
3.7  Region / specialization mismatch (side check)
------------------------------------------------
SELECT DISTINCT cl.claim_id, ad.adjuster_id, ad.specialization, cl.claim_type
FROM   claim_events ce
JOIN   claims      cl ON cl.claim_id = ce.claim_id
JOIN   adjusters   ad ON ad.name     = ce.resource
WHERE  ce.activity = 'A'
  AND  ( (cl.claim_type = 'home_insurance' AND ad.specialization <> 'home')
     OR (cl.claim_type = 'auto_insurance' AND ad.specialization <> 'auto') );

 Mis-routing of claims can be a root cause of “looping” if adjusters lack expertise.


4.  NEXT STEPS AFTER QUERYING


1. Export the suspicious trace sets and replay them in a process-mining tool (e.g., pm4py or ProM) to visualize the exact ordering.

2. Interview business owners with concrete case IDs returned by the SQL to validate whether those executions are legally or operationally acceptable.

3. If hypotheses are confirmed, harden the POWL model:  
   • Add edges loop  C and xor  C.  
   • Replace XOR(N, ) with “conditional branch” guarded by explicit data attribute (e.g., regulatory_region  ‘EU’).  
   • Replace LOOP(E,P) by SEQ(E,P) unless iterative re-evaluation is genuinely needed; otherwise add counter constraints.

4. Deploy conformance monitoring jobs that run the above SQL nightly and alert on new violations.


Summary

• The model allows (1) repeated or order-less E/P, (2) skipping N, and (3) closing immediately after A.  
• Likely causes range from purposeful “fast-track” design to hurried hot-fixes or tool limitations.  
• The provided SQL snippets show how to mine the event log stored in `claim_events` (and enrich with `claims`, `adjusters`) to confirm or refute each hypothesis quantitatively.
