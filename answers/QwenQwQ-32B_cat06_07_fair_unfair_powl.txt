Okay, so I need to create two POWL models based on the hiring process described for GlobalTeq Solutions. The two models should differ in how they handle the cultural fit and community affiliation check. The first one should have potential unfairness due to an XOR branch that gives an advantage to certain applicants, while the second one removes that bias by having a uniform process. Let me start by understanding the process steps and then structure each model accordingly.

In the first model with potential unfairness:
After the skill assessment, there's an XOR branch. One path goes to a standard CulturalFitCheck, and the other goes to CommunityAffiliationCheck, which provides an unfair boost. The process includes loops for resume parsing and data checks. 

First, let's break down the process steps:

1. ReceiveApplication: The starting point where applications are received. 
2. DataCompletenessCheck: A loop if the resume is incomplete. Here, if the resume is missing info (like in the description), a loop triggers RequestMoreInfo from the applicant until it's completed.
3. SkillAssessment: After the resume is parsed and data is complete, applicants take the skill test. If they pass, they move on; otherwise, they're out.
4. Then, the XOR split between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. The latter gives an advantage based on local affiliations.
5. ManagerialReview for borderline cases might still introduce some bias if they see the community info.
6. FinalDecision by hiring manager.

The second model without unfairness would have all applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck, so there's no split or CommunityAffiliationCheck path that gives preferential treatment.

Let me structure each step as a Transition. Then, model the loops and XOR as Operators. Also considering the partial order for sequences and dependencies.

Starting with the first model:

First, the main sequence is: ReceiveApplication -> DataLoop (loop including DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo) -> SkillAssessment -> XOR between CulturalFit and CommunityAffiliation -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

Wait, but how is the loop handled? The initial step is Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check, which is the loop. The process goes like: 
- Parse resume and check data completeness. If data is incomplete (maybe DataCompletenessCheck activity), then RequestMoreInfo is triggered, looping back until it's okay. So that's a loop involving two steps: the initial check and the RequestMoreInfo step.

So in the loop operator, the A part is DataCompletenessCheck and the B part is RequestMoreInfo. Wait, actually, the loop would be structured so that DataCompletenessCheck checks if there's missing info. If there is, B (RequestMoreInfo) is executed, then A again (maybe a cycle). Wait,APON loop is modeled as (A, B), meaning execute A first, then you can choose to loop back via B? Hmm, perhaps the loop here is such that first you perform the DataCompletenessCheck. If it’s incomplete, you have to go through RequestMoreInfo, then DataCompletenessCheck again. So that would be a loop where the loop starts with DataCompletenessCheck, then if incomplete, proceed to RequestMoreInfo (B), which then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck (A) again. So the loop operator would be * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo).

Wait, according to the POWL loop operator description: loop between A and B is (A, B), executed as follows: execute A, then either exit loop or do B and A again. So the order would have to be such that after DataCompletenessCheck, if needed, you do the RequestMoreInfo, then loop back to redo the DataCompletenessCheck? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the first check (DataCompletenessCheck is A), and if it's not okay, you do B (RequestMoreInfo), then A again (another DataCompletenessCheck). So the loop works as: Check data, if fails: RequestMoreInfo, repeat until pass.

So for the loop, the A is the checking activity (DataCompletenessCheck), and B is the RequestMoreInfo, so loop = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo]). Therefore, whenever the loop is entered, first Do A: check data. If it's incomplete (loop continues), then do B (RequestMoreInfo), then repeat A again.

Next, after the DataCompleteness loop, the process proceeds to SkillAssessment.

Then after the SkillAssessment (assuming they pass), the process then takes the XOR branch between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Wait, the problem states: "either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments." So the XOR is between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Since choosing the community check gives a subtle advantage, the branch here creates a potential unfairness.

Then after the XOR is chosen (either path), you proceed to ManagerialReview, which in the first model might still have biases due to affiliation cues even though it's supposed to be a final check. But the main unfairness arises in the choice between the branches.

The ManagerialReview and FinalDecision are next. However the problem says "In the presence of implicit affiliations [...] reviewers may [...] view them more favorably." But in the first model, does the CommunityAffiliationCheck activity provide such information? The presence of that path might encode the affiliation information, so the managerial review sees that and is biased. Alternatively, maybe the CommunityAffiliationCheck activity passes such information on to the managerial review.

Hmm, maybe the flow after the XOR is the same: each branch (both CulturalFit and CommunityAffiliation) lead onward to ManagerialReview and then FinalDecision. The presence of either CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck could influence the ManagerialReview's evaluation.

But in the first model's XOR branch, one of the choices implicitly gives an advantage. So the first model's structure would have an XOR between CulturalFitCheck (standard path) and CommunityAffiliationCheck (the preferential path). 

So in the first model:

After SkillAssessment, you choose between:

1. CulturalFitCheck  proceed to ManagerialReview  FinalDecision
OR
2. CommunityAffiliationCheck  proceed to ManagerialReview  FinalDecision

This way, if the applicant is in the CommunityAffiliation path, their fit rating is adjusted, which the ManagerialReview might take into account, leading to bias.

Wait, but is the CommunityAffiliationCheck the alternative path, which includes the affiliation check? The problem states "the process is not purely merit-based. Applicants who indicate membership [...] receive a slight subjective uplift [...] either go through standard cultural fit assessment or community affiliation path gives uplift."

So the XOR choice is between two paths: the standard cultural fit, or a community-aware path. The CommunityAffiliationCheck is perhaps part of that, and gives a better score.

Hence, in the first model, the branch is either:

CulturalFitCheck (standard path)  then to ManagerialReview
 
OR

CommunityAffiliationCheck  then to ManagerialReview. 

In that second branch, the CommunityAffiliationCheck would apply the uplift and the ManagerialReview may still see this and have a bias.

Alternatively, the CommunityAffiliationCheck activity itself may include the checking and adjustment, so the process could fork here. So in the model, the XOR is between those two activities, and each leads to the next step.

Therefore, in the first model's XOR is between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. 

Now, structuring this as a POWL model:

The overall structure would be:

Start -> [ReceiveApplication]

Then, DataCompleteness loop (so the part between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo as a loop), followed by SkillAssessment. Then the XOR between the two cultural fit paths.

Then, after that, ManagerReview and FinalDecision. They are in sequence after the XOR.

Additionally, need to consider the sequence dependencies.

Let me outline this step by step, creating Transitions for each activity.

First, define all transitions:

ReceiveApplication: Transition("ReceiveApplication")

DataCompletenessCheck: Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")

RequestMoreInfo: Transition("RequestMoreInfo")

SkillAssessment: Transition("SkillAssessment")

CulturalFitCheck: Transition("CulturalFitCheck")

CommunityAffiliationCheck: Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")

ManagerialReview: Transition("ManagerialReview")

FinalDecision: Transition("FinalDecision")

Now building the loops and operators.

First, the initial loop for DataCompleteness:

The loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. 

loop_data = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

Then, the flow after the resume is parsed correctly.

Then, after the loop_data comes SkillAssessment.

After SkillAssessment comes the XOR branching.

xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

Then after that comes ManagerialReview followed by FinalDecision. But ManagerialReview and FinalDecision are sequential, so they can be modeled as a partial order.

Wait, need to arrange all steps properly.

Putting all together:

The sequence is:

ReceiveApplication must come first.

Then loop_data (the data loop), then SkillAssessment, then the XOR, then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision?

Wait, but each of these are connected in sequence. So perhaps the structure is:

ReceiveApplication  loop_data  SkillAssessment  xor_cultural  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Each step must be in a sequence. So how to build the partial order?

Alternatively, the entire workflow can be broken into components with dependencies.

Alternatively, the model is a strict partial order where the main sequence is a series of steps connected with order constraints.

So the overall partial order must enforce the order:

ReceiveApplication must come first, then the DataCompleteness loop, then SkillAssessment, then the XOR of cultural, then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

The model can be constructed as a series of nodes with dependencies.

Breaking down each stage:

Let's first create the main parts:

The loop_data (the Data loop)

The SkillAssessment is an independent Transition after loop_data.

The xor_cultural is after SkillAssessment.

ManagerialReview comes after the xor's children.

FinalDecision comes after ManagerialReview.

So, here's how the steps are ordered:

1. ReceiveApplication

2. loop_data (the Data Completeness check and loop)

3. SkillAssessment

4. xor_cultural (choice between CulturalFit and CommunityAffiliation)

5. ManagerialReview

6. FinalDecision

These must be in sequential order. The paths inside the xor are part of step 4  step 5.

Now, in terms of constructing the model as a StrictPartialOrder, each main step (transition or operator) is a node in the strict order.

First, the root model is a StrictPartialOrder containing all these nodes with their sequences.

Wait perhaps better to structure the model as follows:

Let me see the structure using operators and partial orders.

Let me try to outline the main components.

First, the DataCompleteness loop structure is loop_data (operator loop with Data and Request nodes).

Then, the path is:

ReceiveApplication  loop_data  SkillAssessment  xor_cultural  [either path]  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision

The xor_cultural is the operator between CulturalFit and CommunityAffiliation.

So structuring this:

The sequence from top to bottom would require each step to depend on the previous one.

To build this as a StrictPartialOrder, the nodes would be:

nodes = [ReceiveApplication, loop_data, SkillAssessment, xor_cultural, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]

Then the order relations would be:

ReceiveApplication must be before loop_data,

loop_data before SkillAssessment,

SkillAssessment before xor_cultural,

xor_cultural before ManagerialReview,

ManagerialReview before FinalDecision.

Additionally, the xor_cultural's children (the two transition nodes) must lead to ManagerialReview. Wait, but the xor is itself a node in the strict partial order. So the xor node (operator) must be ordered before ManagerialReview. The ManagerialReview is after the xor operator. Essentially, whichever branch is taken (CulturalFit or CommunityAffiliation) leads to before ManagerialReview.

So the xor is part of the sequence, so its presence ensures the choice is taken before proceeding to ManagerialReview.

Now, the first model (with unfairness) would be structured this way.

Similarly, for the non-unfair model, the CulturalFit path is the only one, so the CulturalFitCheck is not part of an XOR anymore; instead, it's a direct sequence. The CommunityAffiliationCheck is not a path, so we remove the XOR and have a straight CulturalFitCheck after SkillAssessment.

Wait, in the non-unfair model:

After the SkillAssessment, all candidates go through the same CulturalFitCheck, hence no XOR. Therefore, the step after SkillAssessment is directly CulturalFitCheck, followed by ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Therefore the non-unfair model sequence is:

ReceiveApplication  loop_data  SkillAssessment  CulturalFitCheck  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

So, with that in mind, let's now write the code for each model.

Starting with the Potential Unfairness model:

First, creating all transitions and operators for the unfair model.

Transitions:

rec_app = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition("SkillAssessment")
cultural = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
community = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
man_review = Transition("ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition("FinalDecision")

# loop for data completeness
loop_data = OperatorPOWL(
    Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check, request_info]
)

# the xor between cultural and community
xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(
    Operator.XOR,
    children=[cultural, community]
)

# The main workflow's nodes
nodes = [
    rec_app,
    loop_data,
    skill_assessment,
    xor_cultural,
    man_review,
    final_decision
]

# Create the root partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Adding the order constraints:
root.order.add_edge(rec_app, loop_data)   # Receive -> loop
root.order.add_edge(loop_data, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor_cultural)
root.order.add_edge(xor_cultural, man_review)
root.order.add_edge(man_review, final_decision)

Wait but I think each of the Operator nodes (like loop_data and xor_cultural) are themselves nodes that contain their own nodes. But in the StrictPartialOrder, all children (sub-models) must be listed as top-level nodes here?

Hmm, perhaps I need to think recursively. Wait, the elements of the StrictPartialOrder must be the top-level nodes. Each operator (like loop_data or xor_cultural) is a single node in the StrictPartialOrder, even though they have their own children. 

Yes, the operators are nodes in the parent's partial order, and their own internal nodes will be ordered as per their own operators.

Therefore the above approach is okay. The nodes in the root StrictPartialOrder are these transitions and operators, not their children.

Now for the second model (without unfairness):

The main difference is removing the CommunityAffiliationCheck and the XOR operator. Instead of an XOR between cultural and community, after SkillAssessment, all go to CulturalFitCheck.

So transitions:

Same as before except no community and no XOR here.

cultural is still the transition "CulturalFitCheck".

So:

rec_app = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition("SkillAssessment")
cultural = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
man_review = Transition("ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition("FinalDecision")

loop_data = OperatorPOWL(...) as before.

Now the nodes:

nodes = [rec_app, loop_data, skill_assessment, cultural, man_review, final_decision]

The order edges are:

rec_app  loop_data  skill_assessment  cultural  man_review  final_decision

So:

root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(rec_app, loop_data)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(loop_data, skill_assessment)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural, man_review)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(man_review, final_decision)

Wait, but in code variables names might clash, but as two separate models, each with own variables.

Now, in code:

Each model is constructed in Python using the given library, like:

for the first model (with_unfair):

ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck, etc. are defined as transitions.

Then the loop, xor, etc., and the StrictPartialOrder with those nodes with edges.

So putting it all into code:

The user wants both models as separate.

So for the first model, the code would look like:

First, importing everything.

Then, for the first model:

...

Wait, let me get the code correctly:

First POWL with Unfairness:

from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions
rec_app = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition("SkillAssessment")
cultural_check = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
community_check = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
man_review = Transition("ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition("FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness check
loop_data = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check, request_info]
)

# Define XOR between cultural fit and community check
xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[cultural_check, community_check]
)

# Define the overall workflow structure
nodes = [
    rec_app,
    loop_data,
    skill_assessment,
    xor_cultural,
    man_review,
    final_decision
]

# Build the root partial order and set dependencies
unfair_powl = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)
unfair_powl.order.add_edge(rec_app, loop_data)            # Receive -> loop
unfair_powl.order.add_edge(loop_data, skill_assessment)    # loop -> SkillAssessment
unfair_powl.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor_cultural) # Skill -> XOR
unfair_powl.order.add_edge(xor_cultural, man_review)       # XOR -> ManReview
unfair_powl.order.add_edge(man_review, final_decision)     # ManReview -> Final

Second model (no_unfairness):

# Redefine transitions (excluding community_check and xor_cultural, but using cultural_check directly)
no_community_check = """
Wait no, let me redefine:

restarting the parts:

non_unfair_nodes = [
rec_app,
loop_data, 
skill_assessment,
cultural_check,
man_review,
final_decision
]

non_unfair_powl = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=non_unfair_nodes)
non_unfair_powl.order.add_edge(rec_app, loop_data)
non_unfair_powl.order.add_edge(loop_data, skill_assessment)
non_unfair_powl.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_check)
non_unfair_powl.order.add_edge(cultural_check, man_review)
non_unfair_powl.order.add_edge(man_review, final_decision)

But I need to use same variables but ensure they are separate models.

Wait in code, each model uses variables from their local scope.

Wait, but to make it all correct, perhaps I should separate them.

Alternatively, here's the full code for both models.

But perhaps I need to structure it so that for the second model, the loop and other transitions are redone, but they can use the same names except where applicable. Or, using distinct variables for each model.

Alternatively, the second model can reuse some variables like rec_app, data_check, etc., except not the community check and the xor operator.

But in Python, variables can be re-used, but the objects are different. Since first model's loop_data uses the data_check and request_info, which are transitions from first model, but in second model, perhaps only the same instances are needed unless making copies.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can have separate blocks for each model, even duplicating some steps where necessary.

Alternatively, to make it clear, I can re-type them for the second model.

Wait, maybe best to directly write the code for each model step.

Putting all together:

First the Fair Model code:

Wait, in the non-unfair model, after the Skill Assessment, the next step is directly the Cultural Fit check, no option. So the model is straightforward.

Thus, the code for the non-unfair :

# Non-Biased Model (Without Unfairness)
# Redefine cultural check but without the alternative

# Define all transitions again except community
rec_app_no = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
data_check_no = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info_no = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment_no = Transition("SkillAssessment")
cultural_check_no = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
man_review_no = Transition("ManagerialReview")
final_decision_no = Transition("FinalDecision")

loop_data_no = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check_no, request_info_no]
)

nodes_no = [
    rec_app_no,
    loop_data_no,
    skill_assessment_no,
    cultural_check_no,
    man_review_no,
    final_decision_no
]

unbiased_powl = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_no)
unbiased_powl.order.add_edge(rec_app_no, loop_data_no)
unbiased_powl.order.add_edge(loop_data_no, skill_assessment_no)
unbiased_powl.order.add_edge(skill_assessment_no, cultural_check_no)
unbiased_powl.order.add_edge(cultural_check_no, man_review_no)
unbiased_powl.order.add_edge(man_review_no, final_decision_no)

Wait but probably variables should not have the _no suffixes, but in code when executed, the variables would be separate.

Alternatively, using distinct variable names but that's okay.

Now checking for accuracy:

In the first model (unfair):

The Loop is after the ReceiveApplication. Correct. The order chains as before theSkill Assesment comes after the Loop. The XOR between Cultural and Community comes after Skill. Then both paths feed into the managerial review then final decision.

In the unbiased version, there's no XOR; after Skill comes Cultural, then to review and decision.

I think that's correct.

Now, are there any loops or other operators to consider? The only other loop is the data completeness loop in both models.

Other points to verify:

In the unbiased model, the loop is same as in the unfair; that's correct since the loop's part of the resume process and not affected by the cultural checks.

Potential issue: in the first model, is the XOR between the CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, meaning that each applicant takes one path or the other. The problem description says "either you go through standard or community path", so yes, the XOR between those two is the right approach.

Another thing to confirm: the ManagerialReview and FinalDecision are after both paths (of the XOR), hence the XOR is ordered before those. The code ensures that the xor_cultural is followed by ManagerialReview, which then goes to Final.

Yes.

Thus, the code structure should be as above.

Therefore, the first model's code correctly includes the XOR branching with unfair advantage, while the second one has a straight path after skill assessment.
</think>

**POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**  
This model includes an XOR branch that allows preferential treatment for applicants with community affiliations. The `CommunityAffiliationCheck` activity creates a subtle bias.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities as transitions
receive_application = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition("SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition("ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition("FinalDecision")

# Build loop for data completeness check (triggers info request if incomplete)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info]
)

# Build XOR branch between cultural and community checks
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[cultural_fit_check, community_affiliation_check]
)

# Define all nodes in the workflow
nodes = [
    receive_application,
    data_loop,
    skill_assessment,
    cultural_xor,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
]

# Create the root node and enforce sequential order with partial order
unfair_powl = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Set dependencies between steps
unfair_powl.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)          # Receive -> Loop
unfair_powl.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)             # Loop -> Skill
unfair_powl.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_xor)          # Skill -> XOR
unfair_powl.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, managerial_review)         # XOR -> Review
unfair_powl.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)       # Review -> Decision
```

---

**POWL Model Without Unfairness:**  
This model eliminates the community-based branch, ensuring all applicants undergo identical cultural fit evaluations.

```python
# Redefine activities (same except no community affiliation path)
cultural_only_powl_nodes = [
    Transition("ReceiveApplication"),
    data_loop,  # Reusing the same loop structure
    skill_assessment,
    cultural_fit_check,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
]

# Construct the unbiased workflow
fair_powl = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=cultural_only_powl_nodes)

# Enforce the order without the XOR branch
fair_powl.order.add_edge(cultural_only_powl_nodes[0], data_loop)          # Receive -> Loop
fair_powl.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)                     # Loop -> Skill
fair_powl.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check)            # Skill -> Cultural Check
fair_powl.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_check, managerial_review)           # Check -> Review
fair_powl.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)               # Review -> Decision
```

---

### Key Differences:
1. **Unfair Model**:  
   The `XOR` branch between `CulturalFitCheck` and `CommunityAffiliationCheck` allows biased evaluation based on affiliation. The unfairness arises because one path (community-check) may adjust scores subjectively.

2. **Fair Model**:  
   Only `CulturalFitCheck` exists as a single step, removing the potential for bias via differential treatment between applicants. All candidates follow the same path after the skill assessment.
