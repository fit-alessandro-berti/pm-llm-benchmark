# **Advanced Process Mining and Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.**

## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

### **Process Mining Techniques for Job Flow Reconstruction**
To analyze the current scheduling performance, we will use **process mining** to reconstruct the actual flow of jobs and tasks from the MES event logs. Key steps include:

- **Event Log Preprocessing:**
  - Clean and structure the log data to ensure consistency (e.g., handling missing timestamps, resolving duplicate events).
  - Extract key attributes: **Case ID (Job ID), Activity (Task), Resource (Machine), Timestamp, Duration, Setup Time, Priority, Due Date, Disruptions.**

- **Process Discovery:**
  - Use **Heuristics Miner** or **Inductive Miner** to discover the actual process flow, identifying deviations from the planned routing.
  - Visualize the **control-flow graph** to detect inefficiencies (e.g., unnecessary rework, unexpected delays).

- **Conformance Checking:**
  - Compare the actual execution against the planned schedule to identify **schedule adherence gaps**.
  - Use **Fuzzy Miner** to highlight bottlenecks and deviations.

### **Key Metrics for Performance Quantification**

#### **a) Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions**
- **Lead Time (LT):** Time from job release to completion.
- **Makespan:** Total time from first job release to last job completion.
- **Variance Analysis:** Compare planned vs. actual lead times to identify delays.

#### **b) Task Waiting Times (Queue Times) at Each Work Center**
- **Queue Time (QT):** Time a job spends waiting before processing.
- **Utilization vs. Idle Time:** Measure machine and operator idle time to detect underutilization.

#### **c) Resource Utilization (Machine & Operator)**
- **Productive Time:** Time spent actively processing jobs.
- **Setup Time:** Time spent configuring machines between jobs.
- **Idle Time:** Time when resources are available but not assigned.

#### **d) Sequence-Dependent Setup Times**
- **Setup Time Analysis:**
  - Extract sequences of jobs processed on the same machine.
  - Use **sequence mining** to identify patterns where setup times vary based on the previous job.
  - Example: If Job A  Job B has a 20-min setup, but Job A  Job C has a 40-min setup, this affects scheduling decisions.

#### **e) Schedule Adherence and Tardiness**
- **Tardiness (T):** Time by which a job is completed after its due date.
- **On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate:** Percentage of jobs completed on or before due date.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Correlate tardiness with machine breakdowns, priority changes, or poor sequencing.

#### **f) Impact of Disruptions (Breakdowns, Priority Changes)**
- **Disruption Impact Analysis:**
  - Use **process mining filters** to isolate events involving breakdowns or priority changes.
  - Measure how these disruptions propagate delays downstream.

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

### **Key Inefficiencies Identified via Process Mining**

#### **a) Bottleneck Resources**
- **Detection:** Machines with consistently high queue times and utilization (e.g., CNC Milling).
- **Impact:** Causes downstream delays and high WIP.

#### **b) Poor Task Prioritization**
- **Evidence:** High-priority jobs delayed due to suboptimal dispatching rules (e.g., FCFS instead of EDD).
- **Impact:** Missed due dates, customer penalties.

#### **c) Suboptimal Sequencing Leading to High Setup Times**
- **Example:** Jobs with dissimilar setups scheduled consecutively (e.g., large vs. small parts).
- **Impact:** Increases total processing time.

#### **d) Starvation of Downstream Resources**
- **Example:** A bottleneck machine (e.g., Heat Treatment) causes delays for jobs waiting at the next stage.
- **Impact:** Idle time for downstream machines.

#### **e) Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels**
- **Evidence:** Sudden spikes in WIP due to poor scheduling adjustments.
- **Impact:** Increased storage costs, longer lead times.

### **Process Mining Techniques for Diagnosis**
- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Identify machines with the highest queue times.
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare on-time vs. late jobs to find patterns.
- **Resource Contention Analysis:** Detect periods where multiple jobs compete for the same machine.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

### **Key Root Causes**

#### **a) Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules**
- Current rules (FCFS, EDD) do not account for:
  - **Sequence-dependent setup times.**
  - **Dynamic machine availability.**
  - **Downstream resource constraints.**

#### **b) Lack of Real-Time Shop Floor Visibility**
- No real-time tracking of:
  - **Machine status (available/idle/broken).**
  - **Queue lengths at each workstation.**
  - **Job progress and remaining operations.**

#### **c) Inaccurate Task Duration Estimations**
- Planned vs. actual durations often differ due to:
  - **Operator variability.**
  - **Machine performance degradation.**
  - **Unplanned disruptions.**

#### **d) Poor Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups**
- No consideration of **job sequencing** to minimize setup times.

#### **e) Ineffective Disruption Management**
- No proactive rescheduling when breakdowns or urgent jobs occur.

### **Process Mining’s Role in Differentiating Causes**
- **Schedule Logic vs. Capacity Issues:**
  - If delays persist even with optimal sequencing, the issue may be **capacity constraints**.
  - If delays are due to poor sequencing, the issue is **scheduling logic**.

## **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules**
