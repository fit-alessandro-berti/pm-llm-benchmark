Certainly! The data you've provided describes a workflow for handling declarations, which can be payments or expense claims in an organization. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process and its key components:

### Process Overview

1. **Declaration Submission:**
   - An employee submits a declaration.
   - This step can lead to several outcomes:
     - The declaration is approved by administration.
     - The declaration is rejected by administration.
     - The declaration is approved by a pre-approver.
     - The declaration is rejected by a pre-approver.
     - The declaration is directly finalized by the supervisor.
     - The declaration is rejected by the employee (likely due to an error or change of mind).

2. **Administration Approval:**
   - If the administration approves the declaration, it can:
     - Be finalized by the supervisor.
     - Be approved by the budget owner.
     - Be rejected by the supervisor.

3. **Budget Owner Approval:**
   - If the budget owner approves the declaration, it can:
     - Be finalized by the supervisor.
     - Be rejected by the supervisor.

4. **Pre-Approver Approval:**
   - If a pre-approver approves the declaration, it can:
     - Be finalized by the supervisor.
     - Be rejected by the supervisor.

5. **Final Approval by Supervisor:**
   - The final approval step is handled by the supervisor.
   - Once the declaration is finalized, it proceeds to the payment request stage.

6. **Payment Handling:**
   - A payment request is made.
   - If the payment is successfully handled, the process ends.
   - However, there are rare cases where the payment request can be rejected for missing information or other issues.

### Common Issues and Rejections

- **Rejection by Administration:**
  - Often leads to resubmission by the employee.
  - Can significantly delay the process.

- **Rejection by Pre-Approver:**
  - Typically results in a quick resubmission by the employee.

- **Rejection by Supervisor:**
  - Can lead to further review and resubmission or rejection back to the employee.

- **Missing Information:**
  - Can cause significant delays, as seen in the high performance times for rejections due to missing information.

### Performance Analysis

- The most common and efficient path is from submission to final approval by the supervisor, followed by a payment request.
- Rejections, especially those involving administration or pre-approvers, can significantly slow down the process.
- Final approvals and payments are generally handled relatively quickly once all previous steps are completed.

This workflow ensures that each declaration goes through multiple levels of review before being finalized and paid, which helps in maintaining accuracy and compliance within the organization. However, it also highlights areas where inefficiencies can occur, particularly in the rejection and resubmission cycles.
