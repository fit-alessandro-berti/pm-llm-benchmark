The visualization is a BPMN-style process diagram for fulfilling a customer order, shown across four swimlanes (departments): **Sales**, **Production**, **Procurement**, and **Warehouse**. Solid arrows show the internal sequence of work; dashed lines represent **messages/hand-offs** between departments; there’s also a **customer database** data store.

- **Sales (top lane)** starts the process (timer event “Monday morning”), then runs a subprocess **“Check customer’s order”**:  
  1) **Check order for completeness**  2) **Check if customer is already in the database**.  
  An exclusive decision follows: if the **customer is not in the database**, Sales **adds the customer to the database**; otherwise it continues.  
  Sales then **sends order details** to other departments. After receiving a **“Product sent”** message later, Sales **drafts the invoice** and ends.

- **Production** begins when **order details arrive** (message event). A parallel split indicates Production **plans production** while also waiting for a **“Material not faulty”** confirmation (message) from Procurement. Once both are satisfied, Production **manufactures the product** and then emits **“Product complete”**.

- **Procurement** also starts when **order details arrive**. It includes a **“Material Compensation Subprocess”** (ordering materials, with the ability to **return material** as compensation), then **checks materials**. If materials are acceptable it sends **“Material not faulty”** to Production; there is also a path indicating potential **order cancellation**.

- **Warehouse** receives **“Product complete”**, performs **Send product**, and then sends **“Product sent”** back to Sales (which triggers invoicing).
