Based on the provided processes, I've created a simplified Log Skeleton model using Mermaid syntax for a flowchart. This model represents the main flow and branching points of the fine management process, combining the frequent steps from the given scenarios.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Create Fine] --> B[Send Fine];
    B --> C{Insert Fine Notification};
    C -- Yes --> D[Payment];
    C -- No --> E{Appeal to Prefecture/Judge};
    E -- Prefecture --> F[Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture];
    E -- Judge --> G[Appeal to Judge];
    F --> H[Send Appeal to Prefecture];
    G --> I[Add penalty];
    H --> J{Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture};
    I --> D;
    J -- Accepted --> K[Notify Result Appeal to Offender];
    J -- Rejected --> L[Payment];
    K --> M[Send for Credit Collection?];
    D -- Yes --> N[End Process];
    D -- No --> O[Add penalty];
    O --> P{Appeal to Prefecture/Judge};
    P -- Prefecture --> Q[Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture];
    P -- Judge --> G;
    Q --> K;
    K --> M;
    M -- Yes --> N;
```

You can visualize this diagram using an online Mermaid live editor like the following one:

Copy and paste the code into the editor, and it will generate the flowchart for you. This model should help you understand and manage the fine creation and appeal processes more efficiently. You can further customize this skeleton according to your specific needs or add more details as required.
