Based on the provided process variants, I've created a Log Skeleton process model using the constraints you mentioned. Here's the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'), ('Payment', 'Send for Credit Collection')},
    'always_before': {('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'), ('Create Fine', 'Payment'),
                      ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'), ('Add penalty', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'),
                      ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'),
                      ('Appeal to Judge', 'Payment')},
    'always_after': {('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'), ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
                     ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'), ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'),
                     ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'),
                     ('Appeal to Judge', 'Payment')},
    'never_together': {('Payment', 'Send for Credit Collection'), ('Payment', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'),
                       ('Payment', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'), ('Payment', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'),
                       ('Payment', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'), ('Payment', 'Appeal to Judge')},
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create Fine': {1}, 'Send Fine': {0, 1}, 'Payment': {1, 2, 3, 4},
        'Insert Fine Notification': {0, 1}, 'Add penalty': {0, 1},
        'Send for Credit Collection': {0, 1}, 'Appeal to Judge': {0, 1},
        'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {0, 1}, 'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {0, 1},
        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {0, 1}, 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {0, 1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'), ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
                        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'), ('Add penalty', 'Payment'),
                        ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'), ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'),
                        ('Appeal to Judge', 'Payment')}
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the constraints:

1. **Equivalence**: `('Create Fine', 'Send Fine')` and `('Payment', 'Send for Credit Collection')`
   - If 'Create Fine' occurs, then 'Send Fine' should also occur.
   - If 'Payment' occurs, then 'Send for Credit Collection' might occur.

2. **Always Before**: Activities that must happen before others in a case.
   - For example, `('Create Fine', 'Send Fine')` means that if 'Create Fine' occurs, then 'Send Fine' should have been executed previously.

3. **Always After**: Activities that must happen after others in a case.
   - For example, `('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty')` means that if 'Insert Fine Notification' occurs, then 'Add penalty' is executed later in the same case.

4. **Never Together**: Activities that cannot co-exist inside the same case.
   - For example, `('Payment', 'Send for Credit Collection')` means that 'Payment' and 'Send for Credit Collection' cannot occur together in a single case.

5. **Activity Occurrences (activ_freq)**: Bounds the number of occurrences for an activity in a case.
   - For example, `'Create Fine': {1}` means that 'Create Fine' can only occur once per case.

6. **Directly-Follows Constraints**: If one activity occurs, then another activity shall occur immediately after it.
   - For example, `('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification')` means that if 'Send Fine' occurs, then 'Insert Fine Notification' should happen right after it without any other activities in between.
