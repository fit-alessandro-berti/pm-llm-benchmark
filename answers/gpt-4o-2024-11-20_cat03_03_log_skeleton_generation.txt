Here is the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the described order fulfillment process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'IC')  # 'Receive Order' and 'Invoice Customer' must happen exactly the same number of times.
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('RI', 'CA'),  # 'Reserve Items' should only happen after checking availability.
        ('PI', 'RI'),  # 'Pick Items' should only happen after reserving items.
        ('QC', 'PI'),  # 'Quality Check' should only happen after picking items.
        ('PO', 'QC'),  # 'Pack Order' should only happen after quality check.
        ('GSL', 'PO'),  # 'Generate Shipping Label' should only happen after packing the order.
        ('D', 'GSL'),  # 'Dispatch' must only occur after generating the shipping label.
        ('RP', 'IC')  # Recording payment can only happen after invoicing the customer.
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('IC', 'RO'),  # Invoicing always occurs after receiving the order.
        ('CA', 'RO'),  # Checking availability always occurs after receiving the order.
        ('RP', 'IC')  # Recording payment always occurs after invoicing the customer.
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('D', 'CA'),  # Dispatch and checking availability cannot happen together in the same case.
        ('RP', 'RI')  # Recording payment and reserving items cannot occur in the same process instance.
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},  # 'Receive Order' occurs exactly once per process instance.
        'CA': {1},  # 'Check Availability' occurs exactly once per process instance.
        'RI': {0, 1},  # Reserving items is optional and occurs at most once.
        'PI': {1},  # 'Pick Items' occurs exactly once per process instance.
        'QC': {1},  # 'Quality Check' occurs exactly once per process instance.
        'PO': {1},  # 'Pack Order' occurs exactly once per process instance.
        'GSL': {1},  # 'Generate Shipping Label' occurs exactly once per process instance.
        'D': {1},  # 'Dispatch' occurs exactly once per process instance.
        'IC': {1},  # 'Invoice Customer' occurs exactly once per process instance.

    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # 'CA' happens immediately after 'RO'.
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # 'RI' happens immediately after 'CA'.
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # 'PI' happens immediately after 'RI'.
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # 'QC' happens immediately after 'PI'.
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # 'PO' happens immediately after 'QC'.
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # 'GSL' happens immediately after 'PO'.
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # 'D' happens immediately after 'GSL'.
        ('IC', 'RP')  # 'RP' happens immediately after 'IC'.
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Equivalence:** Ensures that certain activities occur the same number of times. Here, "RO" and "IC" must match because every order receiving should have a corresponding invoice.
  
- **Always Before:** Specifies that specific activities must have occurred before another one can happen. For example, you must confirm availability ("CA") before reserving items ("RI") or proceed with picking items ("PI").
  
- **Always After:** Ensures that if a particular activity happens, another one must follow eventually. For example, issuing an invoice ("IC") must follow receiving an order ("RO").
  
- **Never Together:** Defines activities that cannot co-exist in the same process instance. For example, dispatching an order and checking availability don't logically happen in the same phase.

- **Activity Occurrences:** Specifies the allowed number of times each activity can take place. For example, every order must be received exactly once ("RO: {1}"), but recording payment is optional and can occur once at most ("RP: {0, 1}").

- **Directly-Follows Constraints:** Specifies the sequential order in which activities occur. For example, "CA" must directly follow "RO," ensuring that availability checks happen immediately after receiving an order.

This structure precisely models the constraints suitable for the order fulfillment process.
