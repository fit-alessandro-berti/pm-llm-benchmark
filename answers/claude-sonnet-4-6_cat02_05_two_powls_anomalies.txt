# Analysis of POWL Models for the Hire-to-Retire Process

## Standard Hire-to-Retire Process (Normative Reference)

The expected sequence for a normative Hire-to-Retire process is:

```
Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case
```

Each step has a clear logical dependency on its predecessor.

## Analysis of Model 1

### Structure Interpretation

```
Post  Screen  Decide
               Interview
Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close
```

The partial order edges define:
- `Post  Screen`
- `Screen  Decide` and `Screen  Interview` (both enabled after Screen)
- `Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close`

### Anomalies in Model 1

| # | Anomaly | Severity | Description |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Interview has no ordering constraint relative to Decide** |  **Severe** | `Interview` is triggered after `Screen`, but there is **no edge from `Interview  Decide`**. This means `Decide` can (and will) execute **concurrently with or before** `Conduct_Interviews`. A hiring decision is being made without waiting for interview results. |
| 2 | **Interview has no downstream connection** |  **Severe** | `Interview` is a dead-end node — it has no outgoing edges. It contributes nothing to the flow leading to `Onboard` or `Close`. The interviews are effectively **irrelevant to the outcome** of the process. |
| 3 | **No path from Interview to Decide** |  **Severe** | The logical prerequisite that interviews *inform* the hiring decision is completely broken. The causal chain Interview  Decision is missing. |

### Summary of Model 1 Issues

```
Screen  Interview  [DEAD END — no connection forward]
Screen  Decide     [Decision made WITHOUT interview results]
```

This is a **fundamental process integrity violation**: the hiring decision is decoupled from the interview process.

## Analysis of Model 2

### Structure Interpretation

```
Post  Screen        [Screen has no further connections!]
Post  Interview  Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close
```

Where:
- `loop_onboarding = *(Onboard, skip)`  Onboard repeats one or more times
- `xor_payroll = X(Payroll, skip)`  Payroll is optionally skipped

### Anomalies in Model 2

| # | Anomaly | Severity | Description |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Screen_Candidates is disconnected from Interview** |  **Moderate-Severe** | `Post` leads to both `Screen` and `Interview` independently. There is **no edge `Screen  Interview`**, meaning interviews can begin without (or in parallel with) screening. Screening results do not gate the interview stage. |
| 2 | **Screen_Candidates is a dead-end node** |  **Moderate-Severe** | `Screen` has no outgoing edges. Screening happens but its results feed into nothing — similar to Model 1's interview problem, though screening is a less critical gate than interviews. |
| 3 | **Add_to_Payroll can be skipped** |  **Moderate** | `xor_payroll = X(Payroll, skip)` means the system explicitly allows closing a case **without ever adding the employee to payroll**. An employee could be onboarded but never paid — a significant administrative/legal failure. |
| 4 | **Onboarding can loop indefinitely** |  **Low-Moderate** | `loop_onboarding = *(Onboard, skip)` means onboarding can repeat multiple times. While re-onboarding *could* theoretically occur (e.g., corrections), this is unusual and likely unintended. The use of `skip` as the loop-back body makes this feel like a modeling artifact rather than intentional design. |

### Summary of Model 2 Issues

```
Post  Screen        [DEAD END — screening results ignored]
Post  Interview  Decide  [Interview bypasses screening entirely]
xor_payroll allows skipping payroll [Employee never paid]
```

## Comparative Anomaly Assessment

| Criterion | Model 1 | Model 2 |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Core activity sequence (PostScreenInterviewDecide) |  Broken (Interview after Decide) |  Partially broken (Screen disconnected) |
| Interview informs Decision |  No — completely decoupled |  Yes — `Interview  Decide` exists |
| Screening gates Interviews |  Yes — `Screen  Interview` |  No — both stem from Post |
| Payroll guaranteed |  Yes — mandatory |  No — can be skipped |
| Onboarding correct |  Yes — single execution |  Loop (minor issue) |
| Dead-end nodes | Interview (critical) | Screen (less critical) |
| Process can complete meaningfully |  Only if Interview ignored |  Yes, in main path |

## Decision: Which Model is More Normative?

### **Model 2 more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire process.**

### Justification

**The most critical logical requirement** of any hiring process is that:
> *A hiring decision must be made based on interview results.*

**Model 2 preserves this:** `Interview  Decide` is enforced. Despite the screening anomaly, the core causal chain — conduct interviews, *then* decide — remains intact and is correctly ordered.

**Model 1 catastrophically violates this:** `Decide` can execute before or in parallel with `Interview` because the edge `Interview  Decide` is missing. Worse, `Interview` is a dead-end with no process impact whatsoever. The entire interview stage is structurally meaningless.

```
Model 1 critical flaw:
Screen  Decide (without Interview)   Hiring decision made blindly
Screen  Interview  [NOTHING]        Interviews are irrelevant

Model 2 preserved logic:
Interview  Decide                    Decision correctly follows interviews
Decide  Onboard  (Payroll?)  Close  Completion path exists
```

### Remaining concerns with Model 2:
- The **screening disconnection** is a real anomaly — ideally `Screen  Interview` should exist — but screening is a pre-filter; its absence degrades quality but doesn't break the fundamental decision logic.
- The **optional payroll** (`xor_payroll`) is a notable risk but could arguably represent an edge case (e.g., contractor hiring), whereas Model 1's broken interview-decision link has **no legitimate business justification**.

### Conclusion

Model 2's anomalies represent **deviations in process quality and completeness**, while Model 1's anomalies represent **fundamental violations of process logic and causality**. Model 2, despite its flaws, still models a recognizable and functionally coherent hiring process. Model 1 does not.
