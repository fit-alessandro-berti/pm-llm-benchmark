To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, we need to analyze both the process variants and their execution times. Here are some key differences that stand out:

### 1. **Frequency of Rejection at Each Stage:**

#### Protected Group:
- The protected group has a higher frequency of "Reject Prospective Tenant" (2 processes) compared to more extensive screening.
- The most frequent path is `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant` with 484 occurrences.

#### Unprotected Group:
- The unprotected group frequently reaches the `Reject Prospective Tenant` stage, but it's often after multiple screenings. For instance, paths like `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant` occur 1022 times.
- However, the frequency of direct rejection without screening is still significant (674 occurrences).

### 2. **Execution Time Differences:**

#### Protected Group:
- The average execution time for the most frequent path `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant` is relatively low at 89,999.306.
- Processes involving extensive screening have longer execution times (e.g., paths with "Extensive Screening" stages).

#### Unprotected Group:
- The average execution time for rejections can be higher compared to the protected group due to more steps involved in screenings and contracts.
- For example, a path like `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment` has an execution time of 1,440,007.833 seconds.

### 3. **Process Variants with More Steps:**

#### Protected Group:
- Most paths are shorter and involve fewer steps.
- The longest path is `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment` with 14 occurrences and a performance of 1,259,993.929 seconds.

#### Unprotected Group:
- Many paths involve multiple steps including extensive screenings and lengthy contracts.
- The longest path is `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment` with 45 occurrences and a performance of 1,280,091.444 seconds.

### 4. **Impact on Tenancy Lifespan:**

#### Protected Group:
- Most paths lead to tenant cancellation after minimal involvement (e.g., `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant`).
- Even paths with extensive screening rarely result in tenancy continuation due to the frequent cancellations.

#### Unprotected Group:
- While many paths also involve multiple screenings, they often progress through signing contracts and paying rent, indicating longer tenancies.
- Paths leading to cancellation (e.g., `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment`) still occur but are less frequent.

### Conclusion:
The main differences appear to be:

1. **Frequent Direct Rejections:** The protected group has more straightforward paths leading to rejection, while the unprotected group often goes through multiple screenings before being rejected.
2. **Execution Time:** Processes involving extensive screening in both groups take significantly longer, but the unprotected group's processes tend to last even longer despite more steps and cancellations.
3. **Tenancy Lifespan:** While many paths in both groups lead to cancellation, the unprotected group often has longer tenancies due to the involvement of signing contracts and paying rent.

These differences suggest that the protected group might be treated with less stringent criteria for rejection compared to the unprotected group, potentially indicating a bias or unfair difference.
