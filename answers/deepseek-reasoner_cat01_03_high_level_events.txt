### Proposed High-Level Process Steps  
**Groupings, Rationale, and Names:**

1. **High-Level Activity Name:** **Material Preparation**  
   - **Included Low-Level Events:**  
     - Retrieve raw metal sheet  
     - Scan barcode  
     - Place metal sheet on table  
     - Align metal sheet  
     - Preheat metal sheet  
   - **Rationale:**  
     These events represent the initial setup phase where raw materials are retrieved, verified (via scanning), positioned, aligned, and prepared (preheated) for subsequent processing. They are performed in close temporal proximity and involve shared resources (Operator A and Robot Arm #2).  

2. **High-Level Activity Name:** **Welding Assembly & Inspection**  
   - **Included Low-Level Events:**  
     - Pick up welding tool  
     - Weld corner A  
     - Weld corner B  
     - Measure weld integrity  
   - **Rationale:**  
     This group encompasses the assembly phase (welding corners) and an immediate quality check (sensor measurement) to validate weld quality. The actions are performed by Operator B and a dedicated quality sensor, forming a logical unit of "execute task + validate output."  

3. **High-Level Activity Name:** **Coating Application & Curing**  
   - **Included Low-Level Events:**  
     - Apply protective coating  
     - Dry coating  
   - **Rationale:**  
     These steps involve applying a protective layer and curing it via controlled heating. They are tightly linked (coating requires drying to solidify) and use specialized equipment (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2).  

4. **High-Level Activity Name:** **Final Quality Assurance**  
   - **Included Low-Level Events:**  
     - Visual check  
   - **Rationale:**  
     A human operator performs a final inspection to ensure the product meets visual and functional standards. This standalone step confirms readiness for shipment or further processing.

**Key Grouping Principles:**  
1. **Temporal Proximity:** Events occurring in rapid succession (e.g., material preparation steps within seconds) were grouped.  
2. **Resource/Agent Alignment:** Actions performed by the same operator or machine type (e.g., Operator B for welding, Heating Units) were aggregated.  
3. **Logical Phase Transitions:** Groups reflect shifts in process objectives (e.g., preparation  assembly  coating  validation).  
4. **Domain Knowledge:** Names align with manufacturing terminology (e.g., "curing" for drying coatings).  

This abstraction simplifies process analysis while retaining critical insights into workflow stages.
