**Proposed High-Level Activities:**

### 1. **Material Preparation**
- **Low-Level Events Included**:
  - Retrieve raw metal sheet
  - Scan barcode
  - Place metal sheet on table
  - Align metal sheet
  - Preheat metal sheet
- **Rationale**:
  These steps focus on retrieving, identifying, positioning, and preparing the raw material for subsequent processing. The activities are tightly clustered in time (e.g., within 15 seconds for Case A1) and involve sequential actions by operators and machines (Operator A, Robot Arm, Heating Unit) to ready the material. Scanning the barcode ensures traceability, alignment ensures proper positioning, and preheating is a prerequisite for welding.

### 2. **Assembly & Welding**
- **Low-Level Events Included**:
  - Pick up welding tool
  - Weld corner A
  - Weld corner B
  - Measure weld integrity
- **Rationale**:
  These steps involve the physical assembly of the product via welding. Operator B performs the welding actions using a specific tool, followed by an immediate quality check (weld integrity measurement) to validate the assembly. The weld checks are logically tied to the welding phase, ensuring defects are caught early. The resource shift from Operator A to Operator B also signals a new process phase.

### 3. **Coating & Drying**
- **Low-Level Events Included**:
  - Apply protective coating
  - Dry coating
- **Rationale**:
  This phase applies and cures a protective layer to the assembled product. The coating and drying steps are performed by dedicated units (Coating Unit, Heating Unit) and are interdependent (drying is required to solidify the coating). This grouping represents a post-assembly finishing stage.

### 4. **Final Quality Inspection**
- **Low-Level Events Included**:
  - Visual check
- **Rationale**:
  The visual check is a final validation step performed by Operator C after all prior processing is complete. It ensures the product meets visual standards and acts as a gate before the product exits the workflow. This is distinct from intermediate checks (e.g., weld integrity) as it occurs after the entire process.
