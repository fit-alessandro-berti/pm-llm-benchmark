### **Proposed High-Level Process Steps**

#### **1. Material Preparation**  
- **Low-Level Events Included**:  
  - Retrieve raw metal sheet  
  - Scan barcode  
  - Place metal sheet on table  
  - Align metal sheet  
  - Preheat metal sheet  

- **Rationale**:  
  These events represent the initial setup phase where raw materials are readied for processing. The sequence involves retrieving, verifying (scanning), positioning, aligning, and preheating the metal sheet. All steps are performed in close temporal proximity and involve preparing the base material for subsequent manufacturing actions.  

- **Key Resources**: Operator (manual handling), Robot Arm (alignment), Heating Unit (preheating).  

---

#### **2. Assembly (Welding)**  
- **Low-Level Events Included**:  
  - Pick up welding tool  
  - Weld corner A  
  - Weld corner B  

- **Rationale**:  
  This group focuses on the core assembly task of welding. The operator picks up the tool and performs two welds, indicating a distinct phase where components are joined. These events are performed sequentially by the same resource (Operator B) and are critical to forming the product.  

- **Key Resources**: Operator (welding execution).  

---

#### **3. Weld Quality Inspection**  
- **Low-Level Events Included**:  
  - Measure weld integrity  

- **Rationale**:  
  This is a targeted quality check immediately following welding to ensure structural integrity. It uses a specialized sensor, indicating a critical inspection step before proceeding to further processing.  

- **Key Resources**: Quality Sensor (automated measurement).  

---

#### **4. Coating Application & Drying**  
- **Low-Level Events Included**:  
  - Apply protective coating  
  - Dry coating  

- **Rationale**:  
  These steps involve applying a protective layer and curing it, which are logically connected as part of finishing the product. The coating and drying are sequential and performed by dedicated units, suggesting a distinct post-assembly phase.  

- **Key Resources**: Coating Unit (application), Heating Unit (drying).  

---

#### **5. Final Quality Inspection**  
- **Low-Level Events Included**:  
  - Visual check  

- **Rationale**:  
  A final human-led inspection to confirm the product meets visual standards. This step occurs at the end of the process and serves as a gate before the product is deemed complete.  

- **Key Resources**: Operator (manual visual check).

### **Grouping Logic Summary**  
- **Temporal Proximity**: Steps like material preparation and welding are grouped due to sequential execution with minimal gaps.  
- **Resource Consistency**: Assembly steps are grouped because they are performed by the same operator.  
- **Functional Purpose**: Quality checks are separated into distinct phases (weld-specific vs. final) due to their differing objectives.  
- **Process Phase**: Coating and drying are grouped as they represent a post-assembly finishing stage.  

This structure simplifies the workflow into logical stages, enabling clearer process monitoring and analysis.
