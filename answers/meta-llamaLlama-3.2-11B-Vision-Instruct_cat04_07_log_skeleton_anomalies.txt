Based on the provided declarative constraints, I've identified some anomalies in the proposed process model:

1. **Constradicting constraints**:
   - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION') and ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER') are both defined as Equivalence constraints, but they are not symmetric. 
   - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION') and ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR') and ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER') are also not symmetric.
   - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE') and ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE') are both Always Before constraints, but they are not symmetric.
   - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING') and ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING') are both Always After constraints, but they are not symmetric.
   - ('Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER', 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER') and ('Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER') are both Never Together constraints, but they are not symmetric.

2. **Missing constraints**:
   - There are no constraints for the following pairs: ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'), ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'), ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'), ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'), ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'), ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'), ('Payment Hand
