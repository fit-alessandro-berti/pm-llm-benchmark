Based on the interview excerpts provided, here is a textual representation of the invoice approval process that could be converted into a BPMN diagram:

1. START EVENT: Invoice received by Accounts Payable (AP) clerk, typically via email.

2. GATEWAY: AP clerk checks if invoice has a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
   - If no PO number, AP clerk sends invoice back to supplier requesting more details. (Flow ends)
   - If PO number present, AP clerk logs invoice into accounting system.

3. TASK: AP clerk forwards invoice to Purchasing department to confirm receipt of goods/services.

4. TASK: Purchasing officer compares invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) against PO.
   - If discrepancies found, Purchasing contacts supplier directly or asks AP clerk to hold invoice until corrected version received from supplier. (Flow loops back to Task 4)
   - If no discrepancies, Purchasing sends confirmation email to AP clerk.

5. TASK: AP clerk matches invoice line items against PO in the system.
   - If everything matches, flow proceeds to next task.
   - If there are discrepancies (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items):
     - AP clerk emails Purchasing to clarify.
     - If discrepancy can't be resolved, AP clerk escalates to AP supervisor. (Flow diverts to "Escalated Exception Handling" sub-process)

6. TASK: AP clerk sends invoice to department manager for approval.
   - System sends automatic email to manager requesting sign-off.

7. GATEWAY: Department manager reviews invoice details, PO, and confirmation.
   - If all looks good, manager approves invoice in the system.
   - If suspicious details found (e.g., large difference in total amount vs. budget, unexpected items), manager may:
     - Reject the invoice (Flow ends), or
     - Ask AP clerk to hold invoice and investigate further (Flow loops back to Task 5)

8. TASK: After manager approval, invoice returns to AP for scheduling payment.

9. END EVENT: Invoice added to payment cycle.

SUB-PROCESS: "Escalated Exception Handling"
- TASK: AP supervisor attempts to resolve invoice discrepancies:
  - Contacts suppliers or coordinates between departments.
  - For invoices without PO (e.g., informally contracted services), works with department heads to create retrospective PO or decide if invoice should be rejected.
- GATEWAY: Once exceptions cleared, invoice returns to the main flow:
  - Confirmation from Purchasing (Flow returns to Task 4),
  - Approval by Manager (Flow proceeds to Task 7), then
  - Scheduling for payment (Flow proceeds to Task 8).

ADDITIONAL ROLE: Supplier Relationship Manager
- Assists in resolving invoice issues when looped in by AP or Purchasing.
- If invoice missing PO number, asks supplier to provide it or send revised invoice.
- If pricing discrepancy, checks supplier contract and advises AP or Purchasing on correct price.

Note: There may be some uncertainty or variations in the exact sequence between the Purchasing confirmation (Task 4), AP matching (Task 5), and the escalation sub-process. The interviews suggest these tasks may sometimes occur in parallel or loop back to each other before proceeding to manager approval.
