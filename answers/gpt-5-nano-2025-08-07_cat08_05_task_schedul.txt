Below is a structured, data-driven blueprint for using process mining to understand Precision Parts Inc.’s scheduling dynamics, diagnose pathologies, uncover root causes, and design three advanced, data-driven scheduling strategies. The plan emphasizes how to translate MES event logs into actionable scheduling logic that improves tardiness, WIP, lead times, utilization, and resilience to disruptions.

1) Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

Goal: Reconstruct the actual shop-floor flow, quantify timing characteristics, and expose how current dispatching leads to observed performance.

A. How to use process mining on MES logs to reconstruct actual flow and task sequence
- Build the event data foundation:
  - Treat each Job (Case ID) as a case.
  - Normalize event types: Job Released, Queue Entry, Setup Start, Setup End, Task Start, Task End, Resource event (breakdown/start/stop), Priority Change, Job Completed.
  - Capture attributes: Activity/Task type, Machine/Resource, Operator, Order Priority, Due Date, Setup Required (yes/no), Planned Task Duration, Actual Task Duration, any notes (e.g., “previous job: X”).
  - Ensure timestamp precision and ordering, and align events (e.g., ensure Task Start immediately follows Setup End or Queue Entry, depending on the actual process).
- Discover the as-is process model:
  - Use inductive process discovery (e.g., Inductive Miner) to extract the typical routing for different job families and typical bottlenecks.
  - Apply variant analysis to identify the most common routings and the less frequent, exception routings (important for high-mix, low-volume).
  - Generate a resource-aware process model (multi-perspective mining) to include machine/time dimension, not just activity sequences.
- Reconstruct flow and sequencing:
  - For each machine, reconstruct the sequence of jobs and the exact sequencing order over time (which job attended which machine and when).
  - Align observed traces with the discovered model to identify conformance gaps (deviations from the ideal flow) and to quantify the frequency of non-compliant transitions.
- Visualize and quantify:
  - Sankey/flow diagrams: job movement across machines and queues.
  - Gantt-style timeline overlays: machine utilization and queue build-ups over a time window.
  - Heatmaps: per-machine queue lengths, waiting times, and setup occurrences.

B. Process mining techniques and metrics to quantify key performance indicators
- Job flow times, lead times, and makespan distributions
  - Compute per-job flow time: completion_time(last_operation)  release_time.
  - Compute lead time relative to due date: due_date  completion_time; tardiness: max(0, completion_time  due_date).
  - Build distributions (histograms, CDFs) for flow time, lead time, and makespan across jobs, broken down by job family, priority level, and machine cluster (bottleneck vs non-bottleneck).
  - Use survival analysis or percentile plots to understand tail behavior (e.g., 95th percentile lateness).
- Task waiting times (queue times) at each work center/machine
  - Define queue time per operation as start_time_of_task  (end_time_of_previous_operation on the same job or time of Queue Entry if the job arrives and waits for a machine).
  - Build per-machine queue time distributions; compute average, median, and tail behavior.
  - Examine queue time trends aligned with time-of-day shifts or with disruptions.
- Resource (machine and operator) utilization, including productive time, idle time, and setup time
  - Productive time: sum of actual task durations.
  - Setup time: sum of Setup End  Setup Start (per machine, per setup event).
  - Idle time: wall-clock time machine is not processing or setting up when it could be available.
  - Compute utilization = productive_time / total_available_time, and similar metrics per operator and per shift.
  - Break out by “flow path” (which jobs go through a machine) to see if certain paths cause more setups or less utilization.
- Sequence-dependent setups: how to quantify
  - On each machine, map setups to the preceding and following jobs (e.g., previous_job_fam  next_job_fam) and record the actual setup duration.
  - Build setup-duration distributions conditioned on the pair of (previous_job_fam, next_job_fam).
  - Quantify the average and variance of setup times for the most common transitions; identify transitions with unusually long setup times.
  - Use regression or move-average analyses to quantify how much of total setup time is explained by sequence patterns.
- Schedule adherence and tardiness
  - For each job, compute tardiness as max(0, actual_completion  due_date).
  - Aggregate tardiness by due-date buckets, job family, priority, and machine.
  - Compute service levels (percentage of jobs completed before due date) and on-time rates by horizon (e.g., rolling 4 weeks).
  - Measure schedule adherence: compare actual sequences to the planned routing, and quantify the frequency and magnitude of deviations.
- Impact of disruptions on schedules and KPIs
  - Identify disruption events (breakdown start/end, unplanned maintenance) and map their downstream effect on task starts/ends, queue lengths, and tardiness.
  - Compute MTTR and downtime frequency per machine; correlate disruptions with increases in queue times and lateness.
  - Analyze ripple effects: how downtime in a bottleneck propagates to downstream machines (e.g., increased queue length at MILL-03 after CUT-01 downtime).
  - Use causal impact-like analyses (or Granger-causality-lite approaches) to quantify whether disruptions systematically increase tardiness or WIP.

C. Data quality and practical steps
- Handle missing or noisy timestamps with data-cleaning rules; flag events with improbable gaps.
- Align time windows across shifts and machine handoffs.
- Tag “hot jobs” and urgent priorities in logs to see how they are handled under the current system.
- Maintain a rolling dataset (e.g., last 12–18 months) to capture seasonality and trend.

2) Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Goal: Identify where the current local dispatching and lack of global visibility create bottlenecks, misprioritization, suboptimal sequencing, and WIP amplification.

A. Key pathologies to look for with process mining
- Bottleneck detection and impact
  - Identify machines with consistently high utilization and long queue times preceding them.
  - Quantify how much throughput would improve if a bottleneck’s utilization decreased by a small amount (sensitivity to bottleneck improvements).
  - Compare bottleneck impact across different time windows (peak vs off-peak) and under varying job mixes.
- Poor task prioritization for high-priority/near-due jobs
  - Variant analysis: compare routes and timings for on-time vs late jobs; check if high-priority/near-due jobs get pushed back in favor of lower-priority tasks.
  - Examine time-to-start after queue entry for high-priority jobs versus others; quantify delays attributable to other jobs occupying the resource.
- Suboptimal sequencing increasing setup times
  - Analyze sequence-dependent setups: identify transitions that cause long setups and whether a different sequencing would reduce cumulative setup time.
  - Compute the share of total setup time that could be saved with a better sequencing policy (e.g., grouping by family or consolidating similar transitions).
- Downstream starvation and upstream-induced delays
  - Examine whether upstream machines routinely finish work too early or too late relative to downstream capacity, causing queues downstream to build or idle.
  - Use cross-machine flow-time correlations to find cases where upstream scheduling decisions cause chronic downstream idle times.
- Bullwhip effect in WIP
  - Analyze WIP variance across stages and its correlation with demand/priority changes.
  - Identify whether sporadic dispatching decisions amplify WIP fluctuations rather than dampen them.
- Evidence gathering via process mining
  - Bottleneck analysis: quantify critical paths and their effect on throughput.
  - Variant analysis: quantify how late vs on-time jobs traverse the shop, including which machines and transitions are most implicated.
  - Resource contention periods: measure overlap of queueing across machines; identify which events (breakdowns, urgent orders) exacerbate contention.
  - Setup pattern analysis: quantify how often sequences force long, sequence-dependent setups and their downstream impact on lead times.

B. How to present evidence to stakeholders
- Quantify the sensitivity of metrics to specific root causes (e.g., “if setup time average on CUT-01 dropped by 25%, tardiness could drop by X%”).
- Use scenario-based storytelling with concrete numbers from logs (e.g., “During Q2, bottleneck MILL-02 caused 23% of late jobs, with 68% of late jobs originating from upstream queueing”).

3) Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

Goal: Distinguish whether issues stem from scheduling logic, capacity constraints, or inherent process variability, and identify the levers to fix.

A. Potential root causes to analyze
- Static dispatching rules vs dynamic reality
  - Analyze how often local rules (FCFS, EDD, etc.) conflict with overall shop goals (e.g., late-downstream choke points, urgent jobs ignored).
  - Identify situations where rules consistently drive suboptimal decisions (e.g., always selecting a lower-priority job that blocks a bottleneck later).
- Lack of real-time visibility
  - Investigate delays in obtaining up-to-date status (machine availability, queue lengths, progress) and their impact on decision quality.
  - Examine the gap between planned vs actual availability due to breakdowns and maintenance scheduling.
- Inaccurate task duration and setup estimations
  - Use mined distributions to compare planned vs actual times; quantify error distributions and skewness by machine and operator.
  - Determine whether inaccurate estimates systematically under- or over-estimate times, causing schedule drift.
- Ineffective handling of sequence-dependent setups
  - Assess whether current sequencing ignores the true costs of transitions between job families; quantify potential savings from better grouping.
- Poor coordination across work centers
  - Check for misaligned handoffs and lack of global synchronization (e.g., two machines waiting for a downstream step to free up, causing upstream starvation).
- Inadequate response to disruptions
  - Evaluate how the system absorbs breakdowns and urgent jobs; measure delay propagation and recovery time, and whether there is a robust re-plan mechanism.
- Differentiating root causes with process mining insights
  - Capacity-limited vs variability-driven issues:
    - If bottlenecks consistently operate near capacity and adding capacity yields diminishing returns, capacity constraints likely dominate.
    - If even with ample capacity, substantial variance in task durations and frequent re-planning cause delays, process variability and scheduling logic are primary drivers.
  - Use counterfactual experiments via the mined data:
    - What would tardiness look like if setup times were reduced by X% given current dispatch rules?
    - What would happen if a more adaptive dispatching rule reweighted toward due-date tightness?
  - Look for cross-plant signals:
    - If multiple machines exhibit similar behavior under the same scheduling logic, the rule likely causes systemic inefficiency rather than a single bottleneck.

4) Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

Three distinct, sophisticated strategies, each leveraging process mining insights, designed to address the identified pathologies and improve key KPIs.

Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules (Multi-criteria, machine-local but globally informed)

Core logic
- At each machine’s decision point (when a machine becomes available and there is a queue), compute a composite priority score for each candidate job in the queue.
- Score factors (weights learned from historical data):
  - Remaining processing time (RPT) or estimated time to complete current job on that machine and its downstream implications.
  - Due date tightness: slack = due_date  current_time  estimated remaining time; higher urgency means higher score.
  - Job priority level (priority flag or numeric priority)
  - Downstream load risk: estimated queue length and expected wait time on downstream bottlenecks if this job is chosen now.
  - Estimated setup time: predicted setup duration from the last processed job’s family to this candidate’s family (sequence-dependent setup factor).
  - Variability penalty: historical observed variance in durations for similar jobs on this machine; prefer more predictable paths when service levels are at risk.
- Score formulation (illustrative): Score(job) = a1*(normalized RPT) + a2*(normalized slack) + a3*(priority) + a4*(downstream_load_risk) + a5*(normalized setup_time)  a6*(predictable_tolerance_factor). Weights a1..a6 are learned offline to minimize historical tardiness and WIP, with regularization to avoid overfitting.
- Adaptation and learning:
  - Use offline historical mining to estimate weightings that historically reduced tardiness and improved on-time delivery when applied to machine-level decisions.
  Use online re-calibration via reinforcement-like updates (e.g., lightweight bandits) to adjust weights as new data arrives and the shop-floor mix changes.

How process mining informs this strategy
- Provides accurate, distribution-based estimates for RPT, setup times conditioned on job-family transitions, and downstream load predictions.
- Reveals actual bottlenecks and typical downstream queues to bias decisions away from overload points.
- Supplies failure mode insight (which machines and transitions are most unpredictable) to modulate risk-aware decisions.

Pathologies addressed
- Reduces tardiness by prioritizing high-urgency jobs when they are at risk.
- Reduces WIP by avoiding unnecessary early commitments to long or uncertain paths that block downstream flow.
- Improves utilization by selecting jobs that align machine capabilities with downstream constraints.

Expected impact on KPIs
- Higher on-time delivery rates, lower tardiness quantiles, more stable lead times.
- Lower average queue waiting times where bottlenecks exist.
- More balanced machine utilization and reduced extreme peaks.

Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Probabilistic Durations and Proactive Bottleneck Management

Core logic
- Build probabilistic task duration models for each operation, machine, and operator (where operator effect is significant) using historical logs.
  - Candidate models: lognormal, gamma, or Bayesian hierarchical models; include covariates like job family, complexity, operator, shift, and machine.
- Build probabilistic setup-time models conditioned on (previous_job_family, next_job_family, machine, time-of-day).
- Use a rolling horizon scheduler that:
  - Forecasts a probabilistic schedule over a planning horizon (e.g., next 1–2 days or until a buffer is cleared) and propagates uncertainty.
  - Uses Monte Carlo simulation or stochastic optimization to identify schedules with high service level under uncertainty (robust scheduling).
  - Re-plans when significant deviations occur (e.g., a breakdown or urgent hot job), using the mined distributions to re-estimate impact.
- Incorporate predictive maintenance signals (if available) or derive readiness probabilities from logs (e.g., likelihood of a breakdown within the next X hours, MTBF patterns).

How process mining informs this strategy
- Provides empirical distributions for task durations and setup times, including conditional effects (operator, job type).
- Identifies time windows or shifts with higher variability or longer down-times, enabling proactive risk adjustments.
- Quantifies downstream risk by simulating how changes propagate through the process model.

Pathologies addressed
- Reduces lead-time unpredictability by explicitly modeling duration uncertainty.
- Improves resilience to disruptions by planning with probabilistic buffers and re-planning triggers.
- Improves planning accuracy for hot jobs by projecting likely completion windows and prioritizing accordingly.

Expected impact on KPIs
- Tighter lead-time distributions; reduced variance in completion windows.
- Higher probability of on-time performance under variable conditions.
- Improved reliability of promised dates, enhancing customer trust.

Strategy 3: Sequence-Dependent Setup Optimization and Intelligent Batching (Setup-Centric Scheduling)

Core logic
- Create a setup-cost matrix for each machine that captures sequence-dependent setup times (previous_job_family  next_job_family) and historical variability.
- Develop a batching/sequencing policy at bottleneck machines to minimize total setup time while respecting due dates.
  - Methods:
    - Changeover-minimizing sequencing: group jobs with the same or similar family transitions to reduce setups.
    - Time-window batching: allocate specific time windows where a batch of similar jobs is processed to absorb setup costs, while still meeting due dates.
    - Heuristic or metaheuristic optimization (greedy, composite objectives, or rolling-horizon MILP) that prioritizes:
      - Minimizing total setup time over a planning window
      - Maintaining acceptable tardiness levels for near-due jobs
      - Not starving downstream operations
- Practical implementation:
  - At decision points, generate a short-term “changeover plan” for the bottleneck machines by solving a lightweight sequencing problem that respects due-date constraints and priority levels.
  - Use the process-mined setup-cost patterns to predict benefits of re-sequencing and batching.

How process mining informs this strategy
- Quantifies actual sequence-dependent setup durations by transition pairs; identifies the most costly transitions and which job families cluster together in practice.
- Reveals opportunities to batch similar jobs without violating due dates, reducing total setup time and idle time caused by frequent changeovers.
- Highlights machines where setup costs dominate total cycle time and where batching would have the largest payoff.

Pathologies addressed
- Suboptimal sequencing causing high setup times and wasted machine time.
- Excessive setup-related delays contributing to late jobs, especially for high-mix flows.
- Downstream smoothing by reducing upstream-induced variability via better batching.

Expected impact on KPIs
- Reduced non-value-added setup time, lower aggregate cycle times, improved throughput at bottlenecks.
- Lower tardiness for jobs that benefit from reduced changeovers.
- Improved machine utilization by reducing idle and setup-induced gaps.

4) Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

Goal: Rigorously test proposed strategies before live deployment, and establish a loop for continuous improvement using ongoing process mining.

A. Discrete-event simulation (DES) framework
- Build a shop-floor DES model parameterized by process-mined distributions:
  - Task duration distributions by machine, operator, job family.
  - Sequence-dependent setup time distributions and transition matrices.
  - Breakdowns/maintenance: failure rates, maintenance windows, MTTR derived from historical disruption events.
  - Routing probabilities: realistic routing for each job family (including exceptions).
- Validation and calibration
  - Calibrate the DES using historical logs to reproduce observed KPI ranges (flow times, WIP, tardiness).
  - Validate by comparing simulated distributions to historical observed distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Chi-squared tests, or earth mover's distance).
- Scenarios to test
  - Baseline current policy: replicate as-is scheduling decisions and measure KPIs.
  - High-load scenario: elevated demand with near-capacity bottlenecks; test resilience.
  - Disruption-heavy scenario: simulate breakdowns and urgent hot jobs with higher frequency.
  - Setup-improvement scenario: analyze impact of reduced sequence-dependent setup times (e.g., via policy 3).
  - Predictive scheduling scenario: implement Strategy 2; compare against baselines.
  - Enhanced dispatching scenario: implement Strategy 1; also compare with current dispatching.
- Evaluation metrics
  - Tardiness distribution (percent late, average lateness).
  - Lead time and WIP levels (average, max, and variability).
  - Makespan and throughput (units per time).
  - Utilization per machine and per operator; setup time share.
  - Robustness metrics: performance under disruptions, sensitivity to parameter changes.

B. Continuous monitoring and adaptation framework
- Real-time monitoring
  - Dashboards that show current queue lengths, machine utilizations, and the forecasted risk of tardiness for top-priority jobs.
  - Real-time drift detection: compare live distributions of durations, setup times, and breakdown frequencies to mined baselines; trigger alerts when drift is detected.
- Adaptive scheduling loop
  - Deploy a rolling-horizon scheduler that re-evaluates at defined events (e.g., every 15–60 minutes, or when a major disruption occurs).
  - Use an exploration-exploitation approach: occasionally test alternative dispatching rules to learn their impact in the live environment (A/B testing with appropriate guardrails).
- KPI tracking and drift management
  - Track the KPIs outlined above, with automatic reporting of improvements vs baseline.
  - If drift is detected (e.g., a new product family or operator change), re-run process mining to update duration and setup models, and recalibrate scheduling weights or rules.

C. Practical deployment considerations
- Phased rollout
  - Start with a pilot at the bottleneck machine(s) and limited job families to prove value before broader deployment.
  - Use shadow scheduling (offline testing with live data) before enforcing changes in production.
- Data governance
  - Ensure data quality: complete event logs, accurate timestamps, explicit linkage of setups to preceding and following jobs.
  - Maintain versioned models for duration/distribution estimates and schedule rules to enable rollback if needed.
- Change management
  - Communicate policy changes and rationale to operators and supervisors; provide training and decision-support dashboards.
- Governance of the “who decides”
  - Decide whether the scheduling logic is fully autonomous or operator-assisted. Design appropriate overrides and escalation paths.

5) Practical Implementation Roadmap and Deliverables

A. Phase 0 – Data readiness and Baseline
- Assemble a year of MES logs with clean event data: jobs, tasks, setups, breakdowns, due dates, priorities.
- Reconstruct as-is process model, compute baseline KPIs, and create initial dashboards.
- Deliverables: data quality report, baseline KPI report, initial as-is process map.

B. Phase 1 – Diagnostic process mining
- Run inductive/variant mining to identify actual routes, bottlenecks, and setup patterns.
- Produce quantitative evidence for pathologies (bottlenecks, misprioritization, long setups, downstream starvation, WIP volatility).
- Deliverables: bottleneck report, variant analysis comparing on-time vs late jobs, setup-time-by-transition report, disruption impact study.

C. Phase 2 – Strategy design and offline validation
- Implement Strategy 1, Strategy 2, and Strategy 3 in a closed-loop, offline (DES) environment using mined distributions.
- Run multiple scenarios to compare against baseline and against each other.
- Deliverables: simulation study report with performance gain estimates and recommended strategy mix.

D. Phase 3 – Pilot deployment and monitoring
- Deploy one strategy (or a phased combination) in a controlled pilot.
- Build real-time monitoring dashboards and drift-detection mechanisms.
- Deliverables: pilot results, live KPIs, adjustment plan.

E. Phase 4 – Full deployment and continuous improvement
- Roll out the chosen strategy across the shop floor with staged pilots by bottlenecks and job families.
- Establish a continuous process-mining loop:
  - Monthly or quarterly re-mining to refresh distributions, setup matrices, and routing probabilities.
  - Ongoing drift detection and rule adaptation.
- Deliverables: deployed scheduling system, ongoing KPI tracking, documented improvement trajectory.

Key Tools and Techniques to Leverage
- Process mining: Inductive Miner for discovery, Heuristics Miner for behavioral patterns, Variant analysis for routing diversity, Conformance checking for adherence, and Performance/Throughput mining to quantify bottlenecks and delays.
- Data science: pm4py or similar libraries for mining; probabilistic/statistical modeling for durations and setups; regression or Bayesian methods for down-stream load and setup predictions.
- Simulation: Discrete-event simulation (DES) platform (AnyLogic, Arena, Simio, or Python-based SimPy) to model the shop floor with mined distributions.
- Visualization: interactive dashboards to monitor queue lengths, utilization, setup time distribution, and disruption impact.

Closing notes

- The strength of this plan rests on tightly integrating process mining insights with scheduling decisions. The MES logs are the foundation; the models must be kept current as the shop evolves (new products, different operator mixes, changing demand patterns, and equipment upgrades).
- The three strategies are complementary. Strategy 1 provides immediate gains by improving dispatching decisions with a data-driven, multi-criteria score. Strategy 2 adds resilience and predictability by embracing duration and setup uncertainty. Strategy 3 tackles one of the largest incidental wastes in high-mix environments—sequence-dependent setups—through intelligent batching and sequencing at bottlenecks.
- The overarching objective is to transform the current reactive, rule-based dispatching into an adaptive, data-driven scheduling ecosystem. With rigorous validation, pilot testing, and continuous learning, Precision Parts Inc. can expect meaningful reductions in tardiness, tighter lead times, and more stable WIP, even in the face of disruptions and urgent hot jobs.
