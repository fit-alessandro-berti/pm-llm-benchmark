Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to create a BPMN-like textual model based on the interview excerpts provided. Hmm, first, I need to parse all the information from each interview and map out the process steps, decision points, roles, exceptions, etc.

Starting with Mary's account. She mentions that when an invoice arrives, the first step is checking for a valid PO number. If there's no PO, send it back to the supplier. If there is a PO, log it into the system. Then, forward to Purchasing to confirm receipt. Once confirmed, they match the invoice against the PO. If there's a discrepancy, they contact Purchasing again. If unresolved, escalate to the supervisor. Once resolved, then send to the department manager for approval. If approved, schedule payment.

Dan's perspective adds that Purchasing checks if the invoice details match the PO. If discrepancies, contact supplier or hold invoice. If missing PO, inform AP. After confirmation, it goes to the manager.

Carlos says he approves after matching and confirmation. Can reject or ask for investigation if there's an issue.

Rita is involved in exceptions, handling issues like missing info or discrepancies, coordinating with departments, and ensuring exceptions don't stall the process.

Karen helps resolve issues like missing POs or pricing discrepancies by contacting suppliers.

Now, I need to structure all these into a process flow. Let's outline the main steps first.

Start: Invoice received by AP.

Check for valid PO number. If no PO, send back to supplier. That's a gateway here. If yes, proceed to log in system.

Then, forward to Purchasing to confirm receipt and items. Their step is checking against the PO. If discrepancies found, they might need to resolve it, which could involve contacting the supplier (via Karen) or escalate. Wait, but in Mary's account, after a discrepancy is found, they contact Purchasing. Wait, maybe there's a loop here. Need to see the flow.

Wait, after Purchasing confirms, then the AP does a match between invoice and PO. Wait, Mary said after confirming receipt, they match the invoice line items against PO. So the steps are: After logging, send to Purchasing for confirmation. Once confirmed, then do the matching step. So after purchasing confirms, the AP clerk (Mary) does the matching. If there's a discrepancy, then they contact Purchasing again? Or perhaps after matching, if discrepancy, then contact Purchasing? Let me check again.

Mary's process: After logging, "forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system. If everything matches, then send to manager. If discrepancy, email Purchasing to clarify. If unresolved, escalate to supervisor."

Ah, so after receiving confirmation from Purchasing, Mary does the match. If the match has discrepancies, then she reaches out to Purchasing. If that's not resolved, escalate to Rita. Once resolved, proceed.

Then, after successful match, send to manager for approval. The manager can approve or reject. If reject, maybe go back to AP to fix?

Wait, Carlos says he might reject or ask to investigate. So if rejected, AP has to resolve those issues, which could involve Purchasing again or others, then resend for approval?

Then, if approved, schedule payment.

Exceptions and alternate paths: If the invoice has no PO, send back. If during matching, discrepancies, loop with Purchasing. If unresolved, escalate to Rita. When Rita handles exceptions, she might involve Karen if needed. Karen is part of the exception handling by providing info from suppliers.

Also, Karen is involved when there's a discrepancy like missing info or pricing issues. So when there's a discrepancy, perhaps the process branches to contact Karen, who then contacts the supplier, and once that's resolved, the invoice goes back into the process.

I need to note all the roles: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing (Dan), Department Manager (Carlos), AP Supervisor (Rita), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen).

The process flow steps:

Start Event: Invoice Received

1. Check if valid PO number exists (AP Clerk)
   - If No: Send Request for Missing PO to Supplier (AP Clerk) -> End (maybe a loop back to start once it's corrected? Or is it a separate end state? The user might need to loop back once the supplier provides the PO. Hmm, perhaps the process ends here until the supplier responds, so maybe a message to the supplier and wait for response. Alternatively, it's a termination until the supplier provides the info. But in BPMN terms, that might be a message flow or a loop. Since the interview says "send it back to the supplier requesting more details," that could be an exception flow leading to an intermediate termination or until the supplier resubmits with the PO. Since the user wants to model the process as per the interviews, maybe the first step is a gateway: if no PO, exit the process until corrected. Or perhaps the process pauses until the supplier provides the PO? Not sure, but per the interviews, the initial step is to return the invoice to the supplier if no PO. So that's an end point for that path.

2. If yes, log invoice into system (AP Clerk)
3. Forward to Purchasing to confirm receipt (AP Clerk  Purchasing Officer)
4. Purchasing confirms receipt (Dan's role). He checks if details line up with PO. Wait, in Dan's interview, he says he checks the invoice details against the PO. So after receiving the invoice from AP, Dan checks for discrepancies. So maybe after AP sends to Purchasing, Purchasing does their check. Wait, but Mary's process is that after AP sends to Purchasing, once they confirm, AP proceeds to match. Wait, perhaps the Purchasing step is confirming receipt and the details. Hmm, need to clarify the flow between AP and Purchasing.

Wait, Mary's process: After logging the invoice, she forwards to Purchasing to confirm that the goods/services were received. So Purchasing confirms that the goods were received. Then, the AP clerk matches the invoice against the PO. Wait, maybe Purchasing's role is just confirming they received the goods, and the actual line item matching is done by AP? Or does Purchasing do the matching?

Wait, Mary says she does the matching: "I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system." So Purchasing's role is confirming receipt, not the line items. Then AP does the line item match.

So steps after Purchasing confirms receipt (Step 4):

5. AP Clerk does Invoice-PO Matching (Mary)
   - If Match: Proceed to Manager Approval
   - If Discrepancy: Send to Purchasing to resolve (loop back?)

Wait, but Mary says if discrepancy occurs, she emails Purchasing to clarify. Then, if unresolved, escalate to Rita. So the discrepancy handling is a loop between AP and Purchasing, with possible escalation.

If discrepancy, contact Purchasing (Dan). Dan would then check, maybe contact supplier via Karen? If that's unresolved, escalate to Rita. Rita might involve Karen or others to resolve the issue.

Once the discrepancy is resolved, the process goes back to the matching step? Or to the confirmation step? Hmm, the flow after resolving discrepancy would need to return to the point where the discrepancy was found. So after resolving, they can redo the matching step.

After successful match, send to Manager (Carlos) for approval. Carlos can approve or reject.

If approved, proceed to payment scheduling. If rejected, then back to AP to handle the rejection (maybe contact Purchasing again or fix the discrepancy).

Additionally, there are exceptions like when Rita steps in, which involves her coordinating with Karen to resolve issues like missing POs or discrepancies.

So, structuring this in BPMN terms:

Start: Invoice Received

Activity 1: Check for Valid PO? (AP Clerk)
   - No: Send Request for PO to Supplier (AP Clerk)  End (until resubmitted)
   - Yes: Proceed

Activity 2: Log Invoice in System (AP Clerk)

Activity 3: Forward to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation (AP Clerk  Purchasing Officer (Dan))

Activity 4: Purchasing confirms receipt (Dan)  Then, AP Clerk proceeds to next step.

Activity 5: AP Clerk matches Invoice to PO (Mary)

   - If Matched: Proceed to Manager Approval
   - If Discrepancy:
       - Contact Purchasing to Resolve (Mary  Dan)
       - If resolved, loop back to Matching step.
       - If unresolved: Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita)
         - Rita handles exception (maybe contact Karen to get info from supplier), then loop back to Matching step after resolution.

Activity 6: Department Manager Approval (Carlos)
   - Approve: Proceed to Schedule Payment
   - Reject: Send back to AP Clerk for correction (go back to discrepancy handling?)

Then, after approval, Schedule Payment.

Also, Karen is involved in exceptions, so when Rita is handling exceptions, Karen might be part of that subprocess.

Also, note that Karen is contacted via Rita or the AP clerk, but doesn't have an approval role.

Now, I need to structure this into a textual BPMN-like description with tasks, gateways, etc.

Let me try to outline the main flow with decision points (gateways), the roles, and the exception paths.

Possible gateways:
- After checking PO: Gateway (exclusive) based on PO presence.
- After Purchasing confirms receipt (maybe a parallel sequence?), but the main flow continues.
- After matching, a gateway to check if there's a discrepancy.
- The exception path after that leads to contact Purchasing, then if unresolved, escalate to supervisor.

Also, when Rita is involved, she might have a subprocess that includes Karen's involvement.

Additionally, after Manager's rejection, the flow goes back to AP to fix the issue, which might loop back to the discrepancy resolution path.

Also, Karen is part of the resolution, but not a direct step in the main process.

So putting this all together in a textual BPMN-like description, using the elements like tasks, gateways, etc.

Need to note the artifacts: invoice, PO, confirmation, etc. but the user says "if mentioned," so perhaps include the PO number, invoice details, etc., as artifacts.

Also, note exceptions like missing PO, discrepancies, and the escalation paths.

Now, I should start writing the textual model following the structure required: activities, sequence, gateways, roles, artifacts, exceptions.

Make sure to capture all the roles involved in each step, and the decision points.

Also, Rita's role is only in exceptions, so that's a branch there.

Karen is part of the exception handling, perhaps as a subprocess or a message flow.

Also, the system sends an email for manager's approval. The approval is triggered by the system.

Now, let me structure this step by step.

First, the start event is Invoice Arrival.

Then, the first task is "Check for Valid Purchase Order Number" performed by AP Clerk.

Gateway 1: Exclusive Gateway: Has Valid PO?

If No: Task: "Send Request for Missing PO to Supplier" (AP Clerk)  End Event (until resubmission).

If Yes: Task: "Log Invoice in Accounting System" (AP Clerk).

Next task: "Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Goods/Service Receipt Confirmation" (AP Clerk sends to Purchasing Officer).

Then, Purchasing Officer does "Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services" (Task by Dan).

Next, AP Clerk performs "Match Invoice Line Items to PO" (Task).

Gateway 2: Exclusive Gateway: Do Invoice Details Match PO?

If Yes: Proceed.

If No: Task: "Contact Purchasing to Resolve Discrepancy" (AP Clerk  Purchasing Officer).

Then, after that, there's a gateway again? Or a loop?

Wait, after contacting Purchasing, if resolved (maybe a task: "Resolve Discrepancy" (Purchasing Officer and AP Clerk), but not sure how to represent that. Alternatively, after contacting, the process loops back to the matching step once the discrepancy is resolved.

Wait, maybe after Contact Purchasing to Resolve, the process goes back to the Match step. But if it's unresolved, then escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita).

So after Contacting Purchasing:

Gateway: Discrepancy Resolved?

If Yes: Loop back to Match step (but maybe that's redundant). Alternatively, the resolution would fix the discrepancy, so the process proceeds to the next step.

Alternatively, the discrepancy handling could be a subprocess.

Alternatively, after Contact Purchasing to Resolve, there's a gateway: If resolved, continue; else, escalate.

Wait, in Mary's account: "If there’s a discrepancy—like incorrect pricing or missing items—I email the purchasing team to clarify. Sometimes, if the discrepancy can’t be resolved easily, I have to escalate to my supervisor (Rita). After we clear up these exceptions, the invoice goes back into the normal flow."

So the path is: Discrepancy  Contact Purchasing (Dan) to resolve. If they can't, escalate to Rita. Once resolved, the invoice goes back to the next step (maybe back to matching step, but actually, after resolution, the invoice would have been fixed, so the next step can proceed. So after resolution, the process continues to send to Manager.

Alternatively, the flow after resolution would proceed to the next step (Manager Approval).

Wait, the process after successful resolution would proceed to Manager Approval.

So the path after discrepancy:

- Contact Purchasing to Resolve (Task)
   - If resolved, proceed to Manager Approval
   - If not resolved, escalate to Supervisor (Rita)
      - Supervisor handles exception (e.g., "Resolve Exception with Supplier" (Rita, involving Karen if needed)
      - Once resolved, loop back to Match step? Or proceed?

Wait, Rita's involvement: "resolve exceptions, which could involve coordinating with Karen to get the PO created retroactively or get supplier to correct invoice. Once resolved, the invoice is put back into the normal flow."

So after Rita resolves, the invoice goes back to the point after Purchasing confirmation, perhaps?

Alternatively, after Rita's resolution, the process continues to the Matching step again, since the discrepancy needs to be rechecked.

Hmm, perhaps the correct path is that after discrepancy, after resolution (either by Purchasing or through Rita and Karen), the invoice is re-processed through the matching step again to confirm.

Alternatively, the process continues forward once resolved, so the resolution fixes the discrepancy so that the match is now correct.

But to model it in BPMN, the loop would be necessary.

Alternatively, after resolving the discrepancy, the process proceeds to the next step (Manager approval).

Wait, in Mary's account: "once all issues are resolved and the manager approves..." So after Rita resolves, the invoice goes back to the Manager step.

Hmm, perhaps the steps after discrepancy:

After discrepancy (Gateway):

- Contact Purchasing to Resolve (Task by AP Clerk and Purchasing Officer)
   - If resolved, proceed to Manager Approval.
   - If not resolved: Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita)
      - Rita handles exception (Task: "Resolve Exception with Supplier" (Rita, Karen involved))
      - After resolution, proceed to Manager Approval.

Alternatively, the resolution step could be handled, and once done, the process continues.

Alternatively, after escalation, if Rita resolves, then it proceeds to Manager.

So the gateway after discrepancy may have two paths: resolved by Purchasing, proceed; unresolved, escalate.

Hmm, perhaps:

After the gateway "Discrepancy in Invoice-PO Matching", the flow branches:

- Yes: Proceed to "Resolve Discrepancy with Purchasing" (Task)
   - Then, a gateway: Is Discrepancy Resolved?
      - Yes: Proceed to Manager Approval
      - No: Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita)
         - Rita handles it (Task "Coordinate Resolution with Supplier" (Rita, Karen)  then proceeds back to discrepancy resolution?

Alternatively, this might get too nested, but the textual model needs to capture it clearly.

Alternatively, after the discrepancy, the user can represent it as:

After Invoice-PO Matching:

If Discrepancy:
   - Task: Contact Purchasing to Clarify Discrepancy (AP Clerk  Purchasing Officer)
   - If resolved by Purchasing: proceed to Manager Approval
   - Else: Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita)
      - Rita coordinates with Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) to resolve
      - Once resolved, proceed to Manager Approval

Wait, but how is Karen involved? Karen is part of the exception handling. So Rita's task might involve Karen in resolving.

So in the textual model, in the exception path, the AP Supervisor coordinates with Karen to resolve.

Once resolved, the process continues to Manager's approval.

Then, after Manager's approval:

- Approve: Schedule Payment
- Reject: Then, back to AP Clerk to fix, which would loop back to discrepancy handling again?

Wait, if the Manager rejects, then AP Clerk has to address the issue, leading back to the discrepancy resolution steps.

Alternatively, the Manager's rejection would require the AP Clerk to re-process the invoice through the discrepancy steps again.

Hmm, need to detail that path as well.

Also, Karen's role is in exceptions, so her tasks are part of the exception handling.

Now, the main flow steps in order:

1. Receive Invoice
2. Check PO (AP Clerk)
3. If No PO: send back
4. Log into system
5. Send to Purchasing for receipt confirmation
6. Purchasing confirms receipt
7. AP Clerk matches invoice to PO
8. If discrepancy:
   - Contact Purchasing to resolve
   - If resolved, proceed
   - If unresolved, escalate to Rita
   - Rita coordinates with Karen, resolves, then proceed
9. Send to Manager for approval
10. Manager approves  schedule payment
11. If rejected by Manager: send back to AP Clerk to resolve, leading to discrepancy steps again.

Also, artifacts: Invoice, PO, Confirmation from Purchasing, etc.

Artifacts/Inputs: Invoice, PO number, system confirmation, etc.

Exceptions: Missing PO  send back; Discrepancy  loop; Manager rejection  loop back.

Now, structuring this into the required textual BPMN-like model, with all the elements.

I need to ensure that all roles are mentioned in their respective tasks. Also, the gateways (decision points) are at the PO check, discrepancy check, and after Manager approval.

Also note the artifacts, like the invoice, PO, confirmation, etc.

Let me try to write this step by step in the required sections.

First, list all activities, then sequence flows, gateways, roles, artifacts, exceptions.

Wait the user example in the prompt's answer might help. But since I need to do this myself, I'll proceed.

Let me start drafting the textual model as per the user's structure.

11. **Request Manager Approval** (System  Department Manager)  
12. **Approve/Reject Invoice** (Department Manager)  
13. **Schedule Payment** (AP Clerk)  **End Event**  

---

### **2. Sequence Flow**  
1. Receive Invoice  Check for Valid PO Number  
2. If PO present: Proceed to Log Invoice  Forward to Purchasing  Confirm Receipt  Match to PO  
    If Matched: Proceed to Manager Approval  
    If Discrepancy: Proceed to Resolve Discrepancy Path  
3. If PO missing: Send Request for PO  End (until resubmission). If resubmitted, process restarts at "Receive Invoice")  

---

### **3. Gateways/Decision Points**  
- **Exclusive Gateway 1:** *Does the invoice have a valid PO?*  
   - *Yes*  Continue to logging.  
   - *No*  Terminate (send to supplier). Restart if resubmitted).)  

- **Exclusive Gateway 2:** *Do Invoice Details Match PO?*  
   - *Yes*  Proceed to Manager Approval.  
   - *No*  Proceed to Discrepancy Resolution Path.  

- **Exclusive Gateway 3:** *Was Discrepancy Resolved?* (Implicit after Contact Purchasing/Supervisor)  
   - *Yes*  Proceed to Manager Approval.  
   - *No*  Escalate further (handled via AP Supervisor). If resolved, loop back).).  

- **Exclusive Gateway 4:** *Was Manager Approval Granted?*  
   - *Yes*  Schedule Payment.  
   - *No*  **Route back to AP Clerk to address rejection** (Rejection triggers reprocessing through discrepancy phase).)  

---

### **4. Roles/Participants**  
- **AP Clerk** (Mary): Tasks 2,3,4,7,8,12)  
- **Purchasing Officer** (Dan: Tasks 5,6,8)  
- **AP Supervisor** (Rita: Task 9,10)  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Karen: Task 10)  
- **Department Manager** (Carlos: Task 11,12)  

---

### **5. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**  
- **Inputs:** Invoice, PO number, Supplier details.  
- **Outputs:** System confirmation of PO match, Manager’s approval, Scheduling of payment.  
- **Artifacts:** PO document, invoice PDF, confirmation emails, system logs.  

---

### **6. Exceptions/Variations**  
- **Missing PO:**  
  - Invoice is returned to supplier (Task 3). Process ends until resubmitted.  

- **Discrepancy Handling:**  
  - **Path 1:** Purchasing resolves and confirms  Proceed to approval (Gateway 3  Yes).  
  - **Path 2:** Escalation to AP Supervisor (Rita)  Coordination with Karen  Resolution  Loop back to "Match Invoice to PO" (Task 7).  

- **Rejection by Manager:**  
  - Invoice returns to AP Clerk (Task 12  No). Reprocessing requires rechecking (discrepancy path).  

- **Special Cases (Rita’s Subprocess):**  
  - Invoices without PO but valid (e.g., services without PO)  Rita creates retroactive PO or rejects.  

---

### **7. Subprocesses & Subflows**  
- **Discrepancy Resolution Subprocess (Implicit:**  
  - Steps 7 (Contact Purchasing)  8  9  10  loop back to "Match Invoice to PO" (Task 7).  

- **Manager’s Rejection Subprocess:**  
  - If rejected, AP Clerk rechecks invoice and re-runs discrepancy steps (Gateway 4  No  Loop back to "Match Invoice to PO").  

---

### **8. Notes on Uncertainties/Conflicts**  
- **Ambiguity in Escalation Pathways:** Rita’s involvement is described as resolving exceptions but may vary based on issue type.  
- **Karen’s Role:** Her involvement is indirect (e.g., no direct BPMN task), but her coordination is noted as part of AP Supervisor tasks.  
- **Manager Rejection Handling:** The process assumes the rejected invoice re-enters the discrepancy resolution loop.  

---

### **Visualizable Textual Model (BPMN-like Flow):**  

**Start  Receive Invoice**  
 **Task 1:** Check for Valid PO (AP Clerk)  
 **Gateway 1:** PO Present?  
   - *No:* **Task 2:** Send Request for PO  **End** (until resubmitted)  
   - *Yes:* **Task 3:** Log Invoice  **Task 4:** Forward to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation  
 **Task 5:** Confirm Receipt (Purchasing Officer)  
 **Task 6:** Match Invoice to PO (AP Clerk)  
 **Gateway 2:** Match?  
   - *Yes:* **Task 7:** Request Manager Approval (System)  
   - *No:* **Task 8:** Contact Purchasing to Resolve  **Gateway 3:** Resolved?  
       - *Yes:*  **Task 7:** Request Manager Approval  
       - *No:* **Task 9:** Escalate to AP Supervisor  **Task 10:** Coordinate Resolution (Rita & Karen)  **Gateway 3:** Resolved?  *Yes:*  Task 7.  
 **Task 11:** Manager Approves/Rejects  **Gateway 4:** Approval Status?  
   - *Approve:* **Task 12:** Schedule Payment  **End**  
   - *Reject:* **Task 13:** Return to AP Clerk for Rechecking  **Loop back to Task 6** (Match Invoice to PO).  

---

### **Key Artifacts & Data Flows**  
- Invoice details are passed between AP, Purchasing, and Manager.  
- PO number is validated upfront.  
- Discrepancy resolution may involve updated PO details or supplier corrections.  

---

This model consolidates the interviews’ accounts while noting exceptions, parallel roles (e.g., Karen’s indirect role), and loops for reprocessing. It assumes rejections/exceptions re-enter the validation chain from the discrepancy step onward.
