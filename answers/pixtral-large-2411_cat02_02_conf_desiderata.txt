### Identification of Violations

#### 1. Normative Violations

**Case 2:**
- **Violation 1:** The activity "Risk Assessment" was performed before "Credit Check." The correct sequence mandates that "Credit Check" must occur before "Risk Assessment."
- **Violation 2:** The activity "Finalize Documentation" was performed after the loan was rejected. The normative rules specify that if the loan is rejected, "Finalize Documentation" must not occur before closing the case.

**Summary for Case 2:**
- This case violates the normative rules by performing activities out of sequence and performing an activity that should not occur after a rejection.

#### 2. Desiderata Violations

**Case 3:**
- **Violation 1:** The "Credit Check" was performed more than 24 hours after the application was received. This violates the desideratum of completing the credit check within 24 hours of receiving the application.
- **Violation 2:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision was made. The desideratum is to inform the applicant within 48 hours of the loan decision.
- **Violation 3:** There was no "Follow-up Call" before closing the case. Although not strictly required, a follow-up call is recommended.

**Summary for Case 3:**
- This case fails to meet the desiderata conditions by not adhering to the recommended timelines and missing the follow-up call. While not severe, these deviations represent suboptimal behavior.

### Interpretations and Justifications

**Case 1:**
- This case adheres to all normative rules and desiderata. The sequence of activities is correct, and all recommended best practices are followed.

**Case 2:**
- **Interpretation:** The sequence violation (performing "Risk Assessment" before "Credit Check") and the action of finalizing documentation after a rejection indicate a serious procedural error. This could be due to human error or a system glitch.
- **Justification:** It is possible that the personnel involved were not adequately trained on the strict sequence of activities, or there was a technical issue that allowed these steps to be performed out of order.

**Case 3:**
- **Interpretation:** The delays in performing the "Credit Check" and informing the applicant, along with the absence of a follow-up call, suggest inefficiencies in the process but do not constitute severe violations.
- **Justification:** The delays could be due to high workload or system inefficiencies. The lack of a follow-up call might indicate that this step is not prioritized or there was an oversight.

### Suggestions for Improvement

**For Normative Violations (Case 2):**
- **Training:** Ensure that all personnel are thoroughly trained on the strict sequence of activities and the actions that must be taken based on loan decisions.
- **System Checks:** Implement automated checks to prevent activities from being performed out of sequence and to block actions that are not allowed based on the decision (e.g., finalizing documentation after a rejection).

**For Desiderata Violations (Case 3):**
- **Time Management:** Implement reminders or automated notifications to ensure that credit checks are completed within 24 hours and applicants are informed within 48 hours.
- **Follow-up Protocol:** Incorporate a mandatory follow-up call step in the process workflow to ensure it is not overlooked.

By addressing these issues, the loan application process can be made more efficient and compliant with both normative rules and recommended best practices.
