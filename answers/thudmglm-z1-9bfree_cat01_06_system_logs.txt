**Explanation:**

Case Identification Logic:
1. **Case 1 (Document1.docx):** Grouped initial Word focus (09:00:00), typing, save, Excel reference insertion (via cross-app navigation back to Word), and final closure
2. **Case 2 (Email Reply):** Contains full interaction cycle in Chrome from email opening to send
3. **Case 3 (Report Draft):** Isolated Acrobat actions without save mechanism - identified as completion-incomplete
4. **Case 4 (Budget Update):** Excel-specific manipulations following email replying
5. **Case 5 (Quarterly edge):** Later Word interaction afterWord document closure

Activity Naming Strategy:
- Low-level actions transformed to business processes:
  - TYPING  "Edit Content"/"Compose Email" based context
  - FOCUS  "Start Editing"
  - SWITCH  Folded into context-aware activities
  - SAVE  Standardized as "Save"
  - CLOSE  "Close"

Temporal Logic:
- Cross-app navigation (Word  Excel/Chrome) created system boundaries
- Final Quarterly edge edits recognized as new case due to time gap and organizational separation from initial Word session

**Processed Log Story:**
User executed 3 distinct work units:
1. Drafted a preliminary document (Document1.docx) while intermittently updating budget figures (Excel) with context
2. Processed a critical business email through composed reply
3. Finalized a report (Quarterly edge.docx) following document revision sequence

The log shows:
- 2 major document drafting sessions
- 1 email transaction
- 1 budget update operation
- 1 reporting review session

This structure enables process analysis from document workflow efficiency (time between Save/Close actions), cross-app collaboration patterns (Word-Excel integration), and communication coordination through email integration.
