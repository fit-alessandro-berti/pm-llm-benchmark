Based on the provided process variants and their execution times, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, using domain knowledge from loan processing and financial services:

1. **Process Complexity:**
   - The 'protected' group has more complex process variants, involving multiple visits to assess collateral and multiple co-signer requests. Some variants even repeat the 'Make Visit to Assess Collateral' step.
   - The 'unprotected' group has simpler process variants, with fewer steps and less repetition. Most variants involve a single visit to assess collateral, if any.

2. **Loan Approval:**
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of successful loan agreements (signing the loan agreement), with a total frequency of 107 (31 + 39 + 17 + 15 + 13 + 1).
   - The 'unprotected' group has a lower frequency of successful loan agreements, with a total frequency of 56 (1656 + 188 + 183 + 40 + 12 + 5).

3. **Loan Denial:**
   - The 'protected' group has a total frequency of 1269 for loan denials across various steps (229 + 227 + 217 + 138 + 104 + 88 + 84 + 40 + 37 + 33 + 26 + 26 + 17 + 15 + 26 + 15 + 13).
   - The 'unprotected' group has a higher total frequency of loan denials, with 3088 (2709 + 335 + 297 + 80 + 58 + 44 + 23 + 7 + 1 + 1).

4. **Application Rejection:**
   - The 'protected' group has a frequency of 960 for application rejections.
   - The 'unprotected' group has a lower frequency of 664 for application rejections.

5. **Appointment Denial:**
   - The 'protected' group has a frequency of 599 for appointment denials.
   - The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of 363 for appointment denials.

6. **Execution Time:**
   - The 'protected' group has a higher average execution time for their process variants (around 330,000 units of time).
   - The 'unprotected' group has a lower average execution time for their process variants (around 340,000 units of time).

These differences suggest that the 'protected' group may receive more personalized attention, leading to more complex processes and a higher likelihood of loan approval. In contrast, the 'unprotected' group may face more straightforward but less favorable processes, resulting in higher loan denial rates and longer average execution times.
