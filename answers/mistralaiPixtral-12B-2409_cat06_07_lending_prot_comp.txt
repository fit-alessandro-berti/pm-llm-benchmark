To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze the process variants and their execution times. Here are the main differences based on the provided data:

1. **Process Complexity**:
   - The 'protected' group has more complex process variants involving multiple steps such as "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" and "Request Co-Signer On Loan," which are not present in the 'unprotected' group. This suggests that the 'protected' group may face more stringent requirements and additional scrutiny during the loan application process.
   - The 'protected' group has process variants with repeated steps (e.g., "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" multiple times), which could indicate inefficiencies or unnecessary delays.

2. **Frequency of Denials**:
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of loan denials across various process variants compared to the 'unprotected' group. This could indicate a higher likelihood of loan applications being rejected for the 'protected' group.
   - The 'protected' group has process variants with a high frequency of denials (e.g., "Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" with a frequency of 229), whereas the 'unprotected' group has fewer instances of such high-frequency denials.

3. **Execution Time**:
   - The 'protected' group generally has higher execution times for their process variants compared to the 'unprotected' group. This could indicate that the process is more time-consuming for the 'protected' group, possibly due to additional checks, assessments, or delays.
   - The highest execution time for the 'protected' group is significantly higher than that of the 'unprotected' group (e.g., "Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" with an execution time of 369992.182).

4. **Application Rejection**:
   - The 'protected' group has a process variant where the application is rejected outright ("Application Rejected" with a frequency of 960), whereas the 'unprotected' group does not have this variant. This could indicate a higher likelihood of immediate rejection for the 'protected' group.

5. **Appointment Denial**:
   - Both groups experience appointment denials, but the 'protected' group has a higher frequency of this event (599 compared to 363 for the 'unprotected' group). This could suggest that the 'protected' group faces more difficulties in securing appointments.

6. **Skipped Examination**:
   - The 'unprotected' group has a process variant where the examination is skipped ("skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement" with a frequency of 332), which is not present in the 'protected' group. This could indicate a more streamlined process for the 'unprotected' group.

In summary, the 'protected' group appears to face more stringent requirements, higher likelihood of loan denials, longer process times, and more immediate rejections compared to the 'unprotected' group. These differences could suggest unfair treatment or bias in the loan application process for the 'protected' group.
