Alright — let's step through this and produce the **DuckDB SQL query** that solves your case.

---

## **Step-by-Step Reasoning**

You have:

- Table name: `event_log`  
- Columns:
  - `case_id`
  - `activity`
  - `timestamp`

---

### **Goal**
1. For each case, create an ordered sequence of `activity` values sorted by `timestamp`.
2. Treat that sequence as the **process variant** for that case.
3. Count the number of `case_id`s per variant.
4. Select the **top K** most frequent variants.
5. Return **all original events** belonging to cases whose variant is among the top K.

---

### **How We'll Do It in DuckDB**
DuckDB supports:
- `STRING_AGG(column, delimiter ORDER BY column2)` for aggregating ordered lists into strings.
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break it into steps.

---

#### **Step 1: Assign each case its variant**
We first group by `case_id`, order by `timestamp`, and aggregate the `activity` values:

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
```

Here `variant` will be a text like:  
`"Start->Review->Approve->End"`

---

#### **Step 2: Count how many cases per variant**
```sql
, variant_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
)
```

---

#### **Step 3: Top K variants**
```sql
, top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant
    FROM variant_stats
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
```
Here, replace `K` with your desired number.

---

#### **Step 4: Filter cases to those top variants**
```sql
, filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN top_k_variants tk
      ON cv.variant = tk.variant
)
```

---

#### **Step 5: Return all original events for filtered cases**
```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN filtered_cases f
  ON e.case_id = f.case_id
```

---

### **Final Combined DuckDB SQL**

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant
    FROM variant_stats
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN top_k_variants tk
      ON cv.variant = tk.variant
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN filtered_cases f
  ON e.case_id = f.case_id;
```

---

### **Points to Note**
- **`STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp`** ensures the variant sequence respects event order.
- **`K`** should be replaced with an integer (e.g., `5` for top 5).
- This returns **all columns from `event_log`** for matching cases.
- If you have ties in frequency, `LIMIT K` will select arbitrarily among them unless further criteria are added.

If you want, I can also include **the variant and case_count in the final output**, so you know which variant each returned case belongs to.  
Do you want me to extend the query to include that?
