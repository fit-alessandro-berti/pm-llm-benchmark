### 1. Identifying Violations of Normative Rules

#### Case 2
- **Violation:** Risk Assessment before Credit Check
  - **Reason:** The Risk Assessment was performed at 08:20 on 2024-01-11, before the Credit Check at 09:00 on the same day. This violates the normative rule that the Credit Check must occur before the Risk Assessment.
- **Violation:** Finalizing Documentation after Rejection
  - **Reason:** The Finalize Documentation activity was performed at 10:00 on 2024-01-11, after the Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30 on the same day. This violates the normative rule that documentation should not be finalized after a rejection.

### 2. Identifying Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions

#### Case 3
- **Desiderata Violation:** Credit Check completed more than 24 hours after Application Received
  - **Reason:** The Credit Check was performed at 10:00 on 2024-01-14, more than 24 hours after the Application Received at 09:00 on 2024-01-12. While this is not a severe violation, it represents suboptimal behavior.
- **Desiderata Violation:** Inform Applicant later than 48 hours after Loan Decision
  - **Reason:** The Inform Applicant activity was performed at 15:00 on 2024-01-16, more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision at 12:00 on 2024-01-14. This is a desiderata violation, indicating a delay in communication.
- **Desiderata Violation:** No Follow-up Call
  - **Reason:** There is no record of a Follow-up Call before closing the case. This is a desiderata violation, as it is recommended to perform a follow-up call to ensure all parties are aligned.

### 3. Interpretations and Justifications

#### Case 2
- **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check:**
  - **Interpretation:** This could be due to a system or process error where the risk assessment was initiated prematurely. It might also indicate a lack of proper training or oversight in the process.
  - **Justification:** To prevent such violations, it is crucial to implement stricter controls and training to ensure that all steps are followed in the correct order.

- **Finalizing Documentation After Rejection:**
  - **Interpretation:** This could be an administrative error where the system or process did not correctly flag the rejection status, leading to the documentation being finalized.
  - **Justification:** Implementing a clear and robust system to prevent the finalization of documentation after a rejection can help avoid such issues. Regular audits and checks can also ensure compliance.

#### Case 3
- **Credit Check Completed More Than 24 Hours After Application Received:**
  - **Interpretation:** This delay might be due to a high volume of applications, limited resources, or other operational constraints.
  - **Justification:** To improve this, the process could be streamlined, additional resources could be allocated, or a more efficient workflow could be implemented to ensure the Credit Check is completed within the recommended time frame.

- **Inform Applicant Later Than 48 Hours After Loan Decision:**
  - **Interpretation:** This delay could be due to backlogs in the communication queue, ineffective communication channels, or other administrative issues.
  - **Justification:** Implementing a more efficient communication system, such as automated notifications, can help reduce the delay in informing applicants of the loan decision.

- **No Follow-up Call:**
  - **Interpretation:** The absence of a follow-up call might be due to a lack of emphasis on this step or oversight in the process.
  - **Justification:** Emphasizing the importance of follow-up calls in the training and process guidelines, and implementing a reminder system to ensure this step is not overlooked, can help improve alignment and customer satisfaction.

By addressing these issues, the process can be optimized to better meet both normative constraints and desiderata conditions, leading to a more efficient and customer-friendly loan application process.
