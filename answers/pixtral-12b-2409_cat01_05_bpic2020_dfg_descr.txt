Based on the provided process flow and performance data, here's a description of the underlying process:

1. **Declaration Submission and Initial Approval:**
   - An employee submits a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
   - The declaration can be approved by the Administration, Budget Owner, or Pre-Approver, leading to Declaration APPROVED by respective approver.
   - Approvals can be further validated or finalized by the Supervisor, resulting in Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR.

2. **Rejection Pathways:**
   - Declarations can be rejected at various stages by the employee, administration, budget owner, pre-approver, or supervisor, sending the declaration back to the employee (Declaration REJECTED by respective role).
   - Rejections can occur multiple times, with each rejection cycle incurring performance costs.

3. **Special Statuses:**
   - Declarations can have a status of "FOR_APPROVAL" by Supervisor, Pre-Approver, or Administration, indicating that they are awaiting approval.
   - Declarations can also be marked as "SAVED" by the employee, putting them in a temporary state before formal submission.
   - A "MISSING" status indicates that some required information is absent, necessitating employee action.

4. **Payment Request and Handling:**
   - Once a declaration is finally approved, a request for payment can be made (Request Payment).
   - The payment request is then handled, completing the process (Payment Handled).

5. **Exceptional Pathways:**
   - Some declarations skip certain approval stages or follow non-sequential paths due to rejections or special statuses.
   - There are rare instances where declarations move backward or skip stages, such as from "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" to "Request Payment" or "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING".

**Performance Insights:**
- The process involves various activities with different frequencies and performance metrics.
- High-frequency activities like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" and "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION" have significant performance impacts.
- Rejections and special statuses, although less frequent, also contribute substantially to performance costs.
- The final payment handling activity has a much higher performance metric, indicating a significant effort or value associated with this step.

**Potential Improvements:**
- Analyze the high rejection rates and performance costs to identify inefficiencies or bottlenecks in the approval process.
- Examine the rare or exceptional pathways to ensure they are necessary and optimized.
- Consider automating or streamlining certain approval stages to reduce manual effort and improve overall process efficiency.
