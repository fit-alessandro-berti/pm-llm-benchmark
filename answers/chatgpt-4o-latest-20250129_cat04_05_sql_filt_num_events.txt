Hereâ€™s the DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes your task:  

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_event_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
WHERE c.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation:
1. **`case_event_counts` CTE**:  
   - Groups events by `case_id`.  
   - Counts the number of events per case.  

2. **Filtering Cases**:  
   - Joins the original `event_log` with the `case_event_counts` CTE.  
   - Filters out cases where `event_count` is greater than six.  

This ensures that only events from cases with **six or fewer total events** are returned. ðŸš€
