# Analysis of the Event Log

---

## 1. Normative Rule Violations

### Case 1:  No Normative Violations

The sequence is perfectly compliant:
> Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case

All ordering rules are satisfied, and since the loan was **approved**, Finalize Documentation correctly occurs before Close Case.

---

### Case 2:  Multiple Normative Violations

This case contains **three distinct violations** of the strict rules:

| # | Violation | Explanation |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Risk Assessment before Credit Check** | Risk Assessment occurs at 08:20, but Credit Check doesn't happen until 09:00. This directly violates the rule that Credit Check *must* precede Risk Assessment. |
| 2 | **Finalize Documentation after a Rejection** | The Loan Decision was "Rejected," yet Finalize Documentation is performed at 10:00. The rules explicitly prohibit finalizing documentation following a rejection. |
| 3 | **Inform Applicant is entirely missing** | The activity "Inform Applicant" never appears in Case 2. This is a required step after every Loan Decision, regardless of outcome—constituting a **skipped activity** violation. |

**Case 2 is the most problematic case in the log**, violating ordering rules, decision-conditional logic, and completeness requirements.

---

### Case 3:  No Normative Violations

The sequence is fully compliant:
> Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case

Despite delays (discussed below), no steps are skipped, reordered, or contradicted. Since the loan was **approved**, Finalize Documentation correctly precedes Close Case.

---

## 2. Desiderata (Recommended Best Practice) Violations

### Case 1:  Minor Desideratum Deviation

- **Credit Check timing:** Completed within 30 minutes —  well within 24 hours.
- **Inform Applicant timing:** Done 2 hours after the decision —  well within 48 hours.
- **Follow-up Call:** Not recorded —  *Suboptimal.* A follow-up call is encouraged but not required.

> **Assessment:** Nearly ideal. The only gap is the absent follow-up call.

---

### Case 2:  Desiderata Are Overshadowed by Normative Violations

While the timing of activities is within recommended windows, the normative violations are so significant that desiderata analysis is secondary. That said:

- **Follow-up Call:** Not recorded —  *Suboptimal.*
- **Inform Applicant timing:** Cannot be assessed because the activity was **never performed** (a normative, not desiderata, issue).

---

### Case 3:  Multiple Desiderata Deviations

| Desideratum | Details | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Credit Check within 24 hours** | Application received Jan 12 09:00; Credit Check on Jan 14 10:00 (~49 hours later) |  Exceeded |
| **Inform Applicant within 48 hours of decision** | Loan Decision on Jan 14 12:00; Inform Applicant on Jan 16 15:00 (~51 hours later) |  Exceeded |
| **Follow-up Call before Close Case** | No Follow-up Call recorded |  Missing |

> **Assessment:** While Case 3 follows all strict rules correctly, it fails all three desiderata. These are not severe violations but represent **suboptimal performance** across every recommended best practice.

---

## 3. Possible Interpretations and Justifications

### Case 1
This case represents the **gold standard** of the process. The only conceivable improvement would be adding a follow-up call, which may have been deemed unnecessary given the rapid, same-day processing and prompt notification.

### Case 2
This is the hardest case to justify:
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** Could reflect a human error or system misconfiguration where an analyst began the risk evaluation prematurely. In some real-world settings, preliminary risk screening might happen informally, but the normative rules do not permit this ordering.
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** This might result from an automated workflow that triggers documentation finalization regardless of outcome, or a clerical error. Regardless, it contradicts the rules.
- **Missing Inform Applicant:** Perhaps the applicant was informally notified (e.g., a phone call not logged in the system), but from a process compliance perspective, the absence of the event is a clear violation.

> **Recommendation:** Case 2 warrants a **process audit** to identify root causes—whether systemic (workflow misconfiguration) or human (training gaps).

### Case 3
- **Delayed Credit Check (49 hours):** Could be explained by the application arriving on a Friday (Jan 12) and the credit check being performed on the next business day (Monday, Jan 14). Weekend/non-business-day delays are a plausible justification.
- **Delayed Inform Applicant (51 hours):** Similarly, the decision was made on a Sunday (Jan 14) and notification occurred on Tuesday (Jan 16), which could reflect business-day constraints or internal approval routing delays.
- **No Follow-up Call:** Given the already-extended timeline, this might have been an oversight, or the team may have prioritized closing the case. While understandable, incorporating a follow-up call could improve applicant satisfaction.

> **Recommendation:** While no strict rules are broken, Case 3 could benefit from **process acceleration measures** and a reminder mechanism for follow-up calls.
