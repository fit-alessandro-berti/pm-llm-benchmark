Based on the process flow and performance data provided, several root causes for the performance issues can be identified:

1. **Rejected Declarations**: A significant number of declarations are being rejected at various stages (e.g., by ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER, or SUPERVISOR). This indicates potential issues with the declaration submission process, data accuracy, or communication between stakeholders.

2. **Re-submission and Rejection Loop**: There are instances where a declaration goes through multiple cycles of re-submission and rejection, often by the same roles. This suggests that there may be unclear or inconsistent approval criteria, lack of adequate feedback to employees, or systemic issues within the process.

3. **Payment Handled Performance**: In certain paths (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> DECLARATION REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> DECLARATION SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> DECLARATION APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> REQUEST PAYMENT -> PAYMENT HANDLED), the process seems to take a relatively longer time to complete. This might be due to backlogs or inefficiencies in the payment processing system.

To address these root causes and improve performance, it's essential to review the processes, communication channels, approval criteria, feedback mechanisms, and any existing backlogs. Based on this analysis, targeted improvements can be implemented to streamline the process and reduce delays.
