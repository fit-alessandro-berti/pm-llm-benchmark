This visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** that illustrates the workflow of an order processing system, covering four different departments: **Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse**. Here's a comprehensive description:

---

### **Overall Structure:**
- The diagram is divided into four horizontal **swimlanes**, each representing a different department:
  - **Sales**
  - **Production**
  - **Procurement**
  - **Warehouse**

---

### **Process Flow Description:**

#### **Sales**
- **Start Event**: Triggered on **Monday morning**.
- Checks the customer's order for completeness.
- Decides whether the customer is **already in the database**:
  - If **not**, the customer is **added to the database**.
- Once the customer is verified, **order details** are sent to the **Production**.
- The sales department sends the order details and, after confirming the product has been sent, **drafts an invoice**.
  
---

#### **Production**
- The process begins when **order details arrive**.
- **Plan production** based on the order.
- A gateway checks whether materials are fine:
  - If **materials are not faulty**, the process continues to **manufacture the product**.
  - If **materials are faulty**, it notifies procurement.
- After manufacturing, once the **product is complete**, it notifies the **Warehouse**.

---

#### **Procurement**
- Triggered when **order details arrive** or when notified of faulty materials.
- A subprocess called **Material Compensation Subprocess** either:
  - **Orders new materials**.
  - **Returns faulty materials** if detected during checking.
- **Check materials** after receiving.
  - If materials are still faulty, **order cancellation** occurs.
  - If everything is fine, procurement notifies production to proceed.

---

#### **Warehouse**
- The process starts once the **product is complete**.
- The product is **sent** to the customer.
- After the product is shipped, the process ends, and **Sales** is notified to **draft an invoice**.

---

### **Key Elements:**

- **Gateways (Diamonds)**: Represent decision points such as customer database check and material quality check.
- **Subprocesses (Rounded rectangles with a + sign)**: Include nested activities like material ordering and return.
- **Events (Circles)**:
  - **Start events** (single thin circle).
  - **Intermediate events** (double ringed circle) show message sending/receiving.
  - **End events** (bold circle).
- **Data objects**: e.g., Order details, Product complete status.
- **Message Flows (dashed arrows)**: Show communication between departments.
- **Sequence Flows (solid arrows)**: Represent internal process flow.

### **Summary:**
This BPMN diagram details an **order-to-invoice** process, involving order verification, production planning, procurement of materials, order manufacturing, delivery, and invoicing—illustrating the collaboration and decision points across the Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse departments.
