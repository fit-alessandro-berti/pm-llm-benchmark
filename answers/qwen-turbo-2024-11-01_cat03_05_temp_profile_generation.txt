Certainly! Below is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics. This dictionary includes a representative subset of activity pairs along with estimated average times and standard deviations.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 1800),          # Supplier Selection to Order Placement
    ('OP', 'RC'): (86400, 10800),        # Order Placement to Receive Components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 900),           # Receive Components to Quality Inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (10800, 2700),         # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (14400, 3600),         # Component Assembly to Product Testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 1800),          # Product Testing to Packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 900),           # Packaging to Warehouse Storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 10800),        # Warehouse Storage to Distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 10800),        # Distribution to After-Sales Support
    ('SS', 'QI'): (90000, 18000),        # Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection (indirect)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (108000, 27000),       # Order Placement to Product Testing (indirect)
    ('RC', 'PK'): (259200, 64800),       # Receive Components to Packaging (indirect)
    ('CA', 'AS'): (345600, 86400)        # Component Assembly to After-Sales Support (indirect)
}
```

### Explanation:
- **SS to OP**: 2 hours (average) ± 30 minutes (standard deviation) for ordering after selecting a supplier.
- **OP to RC**: 1 day (average) ± 3 hours (standard deviation) for receiving components after placing the order.
- **RC to QI**: 1 hour (average) ± 15 minutes (standard deviation) for inspecting the received components.
- **QI to CA**: 3 hours (average) ± 45 minutes (standard deviation) for assembling the components after inspection.
- **CA to PT**: 4 hours (average) ± 1 hour (standard deviation) for testing the assembled product.
- **PT to PK**: 2 hours (average) ± 30 minutes (standard deviation) for packaging the tested product.
- **PK to WS**: 1 hour (average) ± 15 minutes (standard deviation) for storing the packaged product.
- **WS to DT**: 1 day (average) ± 3 hours (standard deviation) for shipping the stored product.
- **DT to AS**: 1 day (average) ± 3 hours (standard deviation) for providing after-sales support after distribution.
- **SS to QI**: 25 hours (average) ± 5 hours (standard deviation) for the indirect path from supplier selection to quality inspection.
- **OP to PT**: 30 hours (average) ± 7.5 hours (standard deviation) for the indirect path from order placement to product testing.
- **RC to PK**: 72 hours (average) ± 18 hours (standard deviation) for the indirect path from receive components to packaging.
- **CA to AS**: 96 hours (average) ± 24 hours (standard deviation) for the indirect path from component assembly to after-sales support.

These estimates are illustrative and would need to be refined based on actual historical data and process specifics.
