### **BPMN-Like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

#### **1. Process Overview**
The **Invoice Approval Process** begins when an invoice is received (typically via email) and ends when the invoice is scheduled for payment. The process involves multiple roles (Accounts Payable Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, Accounts Payable Supervisor, Supplier Relationship Manager) and includes decision points, exceptions, and rework loops.

#### **2. Roles & Participants**
| **Role**                     | **Responsibilities**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk** | Initial invoice validation, PO matching, discrepancy handling, forwarding for approval. |
| **Purchasing Officer**       | Verifies invoice against PO, resolves discrepancies, confirms receipt of goods/services. |
| **Department Manager**       | Final approval of invoices after PO and receipt confirmation.                       |
| **AP Supervisor**            | Handles escalated exceptions (e.g., missing PO, unresolved discrepancies).           |
| **Supplier Relationship Manager** | Resolves supplier-related issues (e.g., missing PO, pricing discrepancies).         |
| **Accounting System**        | Logs invoices, sends notifications, tracks approvals.                               |

#### **3. Process Flow (BPMN-Like Structure)**

##### **Start Event:**
- **Trigger:** Invoice received (via email).

##### **Lane: Accounts Payable Clerk**
1. **Task: Check for PO Number**
   - **Input:** Invoice
   - **Decision Gateway (XOR):**
     - **If PO exists ** Proceed to **Log Invoice in Accounting System**.
     - **If PO missing ** **Task: Request PO from Supplier** (via email).
       - **Output:** Supplier provides PO or revised invoice.
       - **Loop back to:** **Check for PO Number**.

2. **Task: Log Invoice in Accounting System**
   - **Input:** Invoice + PO
   - **Output:** Invoice record created in system.

3. **Task: Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Confirmation**
   - **Output:** Invoice sent to Purchasing Officer (Dan).

##### **Lane: Purchasing Officer**
4. **Task: Verify Invoice Against PO**
   - **Input:** Invoice, PO
   - **Decision Gateway (XOR):**
     - **If invoice matches PO ** **Task: Send Confirmation to AP Clerk**.
     - **If discrepancy found ** **Task: Resolve Discrepancy** (options):
       - Contact supplier directly (if minor).
       - Request AP Clerk to hold invoice until supplier corrects it.
       - **If unresolved ** Escalate to **AP Supervisor**.
     - **If PO missing ** **Task: Notify AP Clerk to Obtain PO** (loop back to **Check for PO Number**).

5. **Task: Send Confirmation to AP Clerk**
   - **Output:** Confirmation email sent to AP Clerk.

##### **Lane: Accounts Payable Clerk**
6. **Task: Match Invoice Line Items Against PO**
   - **Input:** Invoice, PO, Purchasing confirmation
   - **Decision Gateway (XOR):**
     - **If match ** **Task: Forward to Department Manager for Approval**.
     - **If mismatch ** **Task: Escalate Discrepancy to Purchasing** (loop back to **Verify Invoice Against PO**).
       - **If unresolved ** Escalate to **AP Supervisor**.

7. **Task: Forward to Department Manager for Approval**
   - **Output:** System sends automatic approval request to Manager.

##### **Lane: Department Manager**
8. **Task: Review and Approve Invoice**
   - **Input:** Invoice, PO, Purchasing confirmation
   - **Decision Gateway (XOR):**
     - **If approved ** **Task: Notify AP Clerk** (system updates status).
     - **If rejected ** **Task: Request Investigation** (AP Clerk or Purchasing rechecks).
       - **Loop back to:** **Match Invoice Line Items Against PO** or **Verify Invoice Against PO**.

##### **Lane: Accounts Payable Clerk**
9. **Task: Schedule for Payment**
   - **Input:** Approved invoice
   - **Output:** Invoice added to payment run.

##### **End Event:**
- **Outcome:** Invoice scheduled for payment.

#### **4. Exceptions & Variations**
| **Exception**                          | **Handling Path**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Missing PO**                         | AP Clerk requests PO from supplier  Supplier provides PO  Re-enter process.     |
| **Discrepancy (Pricing/Quantity)**     | Purchasing resolves with supplier  If unresolved, escalate to AP Supervisor.     |
| **Informal/No-PO Invoices**            | AP Supervisor works with department to create retrospective PO or reject invoice. |
| **Manager Rejection**                  | AP Clerk or Purchasing investigates  Re-submit for approval.                     |
| **Supplier Non-Response**              | AP Supervisor or Supplier Relationship Manager intervenes.                       |

#### **5. Artifacts (Data Objects)**
| **Artifact**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Invoice**                | Document received from supplier (email or paper).                              |
| **Purchase Order (PO)**    | Official document authorizing the purchase.                                    |
| **Confirmation Email**     | Purchasing’s verification that goods/services were received.                   |
| **Approval Request**       | System-generated notification to Department Manager.                           |
| **Payment Schedule**       | List of approved invoices for the next payment run.                            |

#### **6. Key Decision Points (Gateways)**
| **Gateway**               | **Type** | **Conditions**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PO Exists?**            | XOR      | Yes  Log invoice; No  Request PO.                                          |
| **Invoice Matches PO?**   | XOR      | Yes  Forward to Manager; No  Resolve discrepancy.                          |
| **Manager Approval?**     | XOR      | Approve  Schedule payment; Reject  Investigate.                            |

#### **7. Notes on Ambiguities & Conflicts**
- **PO Confirmation:** Mary (AP Clerk) forwards invoices to Purchasing for receipt confirmation, but Dan (Purchasing Officer) describes verifying invoice details against the PO. The process likely involves **both** receipt confirmation and invoice-PO matching.
- **Escalation Path:** Rita (AP Supervisor) mentions handling exceptions, but it’s unclear whether she directly contacts suppliers or delegates to Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager). The model assumes Karen is looped in for supplier-related issues.
- **Informal Invoices:** Rita describes handling invoices without POs, but the standard flow assumes a PO exists. This suggests a **parallel exception path** for no-PO cases.

---

#### **8. Visualization Guidance**
To convert this into a **BPMN diagram**, the following elements should be included:
- **Pools/Lanes:** One per role (AP Clerk, Purchasing, Manager, AP Supervisor, Supplier Relationship Manager).
- **Tasks:** As listed above (e.g., "Check for PO Number," "Verify Invoice Against PO").
- **Gateways:** XOR gateways at decision points (e.g., "PO Exists?").
- **Sequence Flows:** Arrows connecting tasks in order, with loops for rework.
- **Exception Flows:** Dotted lines for escalations (e.g., to AP Supervisor).
- **Data Objects:** Attach artifacts (e.g., Invoice, PO) to relevant tasks.

This model captures the **as-is process** based on stakeholder interviews, including standard flows and exceptions.
