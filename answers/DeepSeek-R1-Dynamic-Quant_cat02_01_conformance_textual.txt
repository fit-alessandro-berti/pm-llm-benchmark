Okay, so I need to figure out which of these cases are violating the normative process described. Let's start by understanding what the normative process says.

First, the process starts with "Receive order", then moves to "Check inventory". After that, depending on whether there's enough stock or not, it branches into two paths. If there's sufficient inventory, they should do Authorize Payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order. If not, they go Cancel order  Close order.

The key constraints are:
8. Authorize payment only after Check Inventory and before Packaging.
9. Package items comes after authorization and before shipping.
10. Ship order is after packaging and never after cancellation.
11. Close order must be the final step in all cases.

Looking at each case:

Case 1: The activities go Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. This follows the sufficient inventory path perfectly, so no violation here.

Case 2: Activities are Receive  Check  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship  Close. Hmm, packaging happens before authorization? That's a problem because according to the rules, authorize should come before package. So this violates the order. They packaged without authorizing payment first. Also, shipping after that would be okay if they had authorized properly, but since packaging was done out of order, it’s a violation.

Case 3: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close. Wait, here they canceled the order but then shipped afterwards. The normative process says once you cancel, you shouldn't ship because cancellation implies insufficient inventory and no fulfillment steps should follow. So shipping after cancel is definitely a violation. Also, why authorize payment if they are going to cancel? That seems odd. Maybe even authorizing before knowing inventory was sufficient or not?

Case 4: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. Perfect for the insufficient path. No issues here.

Case 5: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close. Wait, where's Package items? The process requires that after authorization, you package then ship. Skipping packaging and going straight to shipping is a violation because packaging is required before shipping. Also, no mention of canceling or insufficient inventory here—maybe the inventory was sufficient but they skipped steps.

So summarizing:

Case 2: Packaging before Authorization (violation).
Case 3: Shipping after Cancel (violation), also maybe authorizing payment despite cancellation.
Case 5: Missing Package items between Authorize and Ship (violation).

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Normative Process:**
   - The process begins with "Receive order," followed by "Check inventory."
   - If sufficient inventory:
     - Sequence must be: Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package Items  Ship Order  Close.
   - If insufficient inventory:
     - Sequence must be: Receive  Check  Cancel Order  Close.
   - Key constraints include specific activity order dependencies and prohibitions (e.g., no shipping after cancellation).

2. **Analyzing Each Case:**

**Case 1:**
- Activities follow the correct sequence for sufficient inventory without deviations.
- **No violation.**

**Case 2:**
2. **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
   - Normative process requires authorization before packaging, as payment validation is necessary prior to preparing goods.

3. **Explanation:** The reversal of these steps invalidates the logical flow—payment must be confirmed before item preparation.

**Case 3:**
1. **Violation A:** Shipping occurs after cancellation.
   - Cancellation implies insufficient inventory; thus, shipping should not follow.
2. **Violation B:** Authorizing payment despite eventual cancellation.
   - Authorization is unnecessary if the order will be canceled due to insufficient stock.

4. **Explanation:** The process inconsistently authorizes payment then cancels and ships post-cancellation—a double violation of prescribed sequences.

**Case 4:**
- Activities correctly follow the insufficient inventory path without deviations.
0. **No violation.**

**Case 5:**
1. **Violation:** Missing "Package items" between authorization and shipping.
   - Normative process mandates packaging after payment authorization and before shipping; skipping this step disrupts the expected workflow.

3. **Explanation:** Without packaging, shipping cannot logically occur as items must be prepared first.

---

**Final Answer:**

The cases violating the normative process are:

- **Case 2**: Violates order by "Package items" occurring before "Authorize payment."
- **Case 3**: Violates by shipping after cancellation and authorizing payment unnecessarily post-check.
# **Case 5**: Violates by omitting "Package items" between authorization and shipment.

**Explanation of Violations:**

1. **Case 2:** 
   - The normative process mandates that "Authorize payment" must precede "Package items." Packaging before payment validation breaches the logical requirement to confirm financial validity before preparing goods.

2. **Case 3:**
   - Shipping post-cancellation violates the prohibition against fulfillment activities after cancellation. Additionally, authorizing payment despite insufficient inventory (leading to cancellation) is illogical and noncompliant with process intent.

3. **Case 5:** 
   - Skipping "Package items" disrupts the sequence; packaging is required before shipping as goods must be prepared for dispatch. Omitting this step invalidates the expected workflow.
