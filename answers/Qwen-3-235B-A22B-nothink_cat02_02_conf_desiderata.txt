Let's analyze the **event log** in light of the **normative rules (Part 1)** and the **desiderata (Part 2)**.

---

##  **1. Violations of Normative Rules**

###  **Case 2** – **Multiple Normative Violations**

####  **Violation 1: Risk Assessment before Credit Check**
- **Activity order:**  
  - `Risk Assessment` (2024-01-11 08:20)  
  - `Credit Check` (2024-01-11 09:00)  
- **Violation:**  
  - This violates the **strict ordering rule**: **Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment**.

####  **Violation 2: Finalize Documentation after Loan Rejection**
- **Activity order:**
  - `Loan Decision (Rejected)` (2024-01-11 09:30)  
  - `Finalize Documentation` (2024-01-11 10:00)  
- **Violation:**  
  - **Finalizing documentation after a rejected loan is not allowed.**  
  - Normative rule: *If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case.*

---

###  **Case 1** – **No Normative Violations**

- All steps are executed in the correct order:
  - Application Received  
  - Credit Check  
  - Risk Assessment  
  - Loan Decision (Approved)  
  - Inform Applicant  
  - Finalize Documentation  
  - Close Case  
- All conditions are met:
  - Approved  Finalize before Close  
  - No steps skipped or reordered  
  - No contradictory actions  

---

###  **Case 3** – **No Normative Violations**

- The process is executed in the correct order:
  - Application Received  
  - Credit Check  
  - Risk Assessment  
  - Loan Decision (Approved)  
  - Inform Applicant  
  - Finalize Documentation  
  - Close Case  
- No skipped or reordered steps  
- Finalize Documentation occurs **after approval**, so it is valid  

---

##  **2. Violations of Desiderata (Recommended, Not Strict)**

###  **Case 3**

####  **Desideratum Violation 1: Credit Check Delayed**
- **Application Received:** 2024-01-12 09:00  
- **Credit Check:** 2024-01-14 10:00  
- **Elapsed Time:** Over 48 hours  
- **Recommended:** Credit Check within 24 hours  
- **Violation Type:** Timing desideratum  

####  **Desideratum Violation 2: Inform Applicant Delayed**
- **Loan Decision:** 2024-01-14 12:00  
- **Inform Applicant:** 2024-01-16 15:00  
- **Elapsed Time:** ~2 days, 3 hours (slightly over 48 hours)  
- **Recommended:** Inform Applicant within 48 hours  
- **Violation Type:** Timing desideratum  

####  **Desideratum Violation 3: Missing Follow-up Call**
- **Recommended:** Follow-up Call sometime before closing the case  
- **Observed:** No Follow-up Call recorded  
- **Violation Type:** Optional activity not performed

##  **3. Interpretations and Justifications**

###  **Case 2: Risk Assessment Before Credit Check**
- **Interpretation:**  
  - Possibly a clerical or system error where the Risk Assessment was initiated prematurely.  
  - Could indicate a lack of training or a flaw in the workflow automation system.  
  - Alternatively, a manual override might have occurred, but this is not acceptable under **normative constraints**.

###  **Case 2: Finalize Documentation after Rejection**
- **Interpretation:**  
  - Likely an error in execution or miscommunication in the loan processing team.  
  - Could suggest confusion between document preparation and finalization.  
  - Regardless of intent, **this violates a strict rule** and must be corrected.

###  **Case 3: Delays in Credit Check and Informing Applicant**
- **Interpretation:**  
  - Delays could be due to high workload, system bottlenecks, or unforeseen circumstances (e.g., holidays, staff absence).  
  - While not normatively wrong, these delays may reduce customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

###  **Case 3: No Follow-up Call**
- **Interpretation:**  
  - The absence of a follow-up call may reflect resource constraints or low prioritization of soft-process steps.  
  - While not mandatory, including a follow-up call could improve customer experience and reduce post-decision confusion.

##  **Summary Table**

| Case | Normative Violations | Desiderata Violations | Notes |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| 1 |  None |  None | Fully compliant |
| 2 |  Risk before Credit Check<br> Finalize after Rejection |  None | Major process violations |
| 3 |  None |  Delayed Credit Check<br> Delayed Inform Applicant<br> No Follow-up Call | Suboptimal timing and missing optional step |

##  Recommendations

1. **Case 2:**
   - Re-train or audit the process handling team.
   - Implement system constraints to **prevent out-of-sequence activities**.
   - Review system logs to identify whether this was an isolated or recurring issue.

2. **Case 3:**
   - Analyze delays to identify bottlenecks (e.g., system issues, workload).
   - Consider **automated reminders** for optional steps like Follow-up Calls.
   - Use **performance dashboards** to monitor adherence to desiderata.

3. **System-wide:**
   - Use **process mining tools** to detect deviations automatically.
   - Ensure **event logs capture all relevant steps**, including optional ones like follow-ups.
