# Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: A Comprehensive Optimization Approach

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration

**Integration Strategy:**
To create a cohesive event log, I would implement a multi-stage ETL pipeline:

1. **Temporal Alignment**: Synchronize timestamps across all systems to a common timezone and format
2. **Entity Resolution**: Create unified identifiers linking vehicles, drivers, packages, and locations across systems
3. **Event Granularity Normalization**: 
   - GPS data (high frequency) would be aggregated into meaningful events (e.g., "Enter Traffic Zone", "Extended Idle")
   - Scanner events would be enriched with GPS location data
   - Maintenance events would be linked to affected vehicle operational traces

**Key Challenges:**
- **Data Quality Issues**: GPS signal loss in urban canyons, inconsistent scanner usage by drivers
- **Semantic Gaps**: Translating low-level GPS coordinates into business-meaningful locations (customer sites, traffic zones)
- **Temporal Resolution Mismatches**: GPS updates every few seconds vs. scanner events being discrete
- **Missing Data**: Handling cases where drivers forget to scan or GPS fails

**Solution Approach:**
```
Event Log Schema:
- Case ID: Vehicle-Day (primary) with Package-Journey as sub-case
- Activities: Hierarchical (High-level: Delivery Stop, Low-level: Arrive/Scan/Depart)
- Attributes: Vehicle_ID, Driver_ID, Package_ID, Location_Type, Speed, Distance_from_Plan
- Timestamps: Start and Complete times for each activity
```

### Process Discovery

I would apply multiple discovery algorithms to capture different perspectives:

1. **Fuzzy Miner**: To handle the high complexity and noise in GPS data, revealing the main delivery flow while abstracting less frequent behaviors
2. **Inductive Miner**: To create a structured process model showing the core delivery sequence
3. **Directly-Follows Graphs**: To identify common patterns and exceptional paths

The discovered model would typically reveal:
- Standard flow: Depot  Travel  Customer Stop  Travel  ...  Return to Depot
- Variants including: Maintenance stops, failed delivery reattempts, lunch breaks, refueling
- Loops: Multiple attempts at same address, returning to previously visited areas

### Conformance Checking

**Approach:**
1. **Token-Based Replay**: Compare actual GPS traces against planned routes to identify:
   - Route sequence deviations (visiting stops out of order)
   - Unplanned stops (>5 minutes stationary not at customer location)
   - Missing planned stops
   
2. **Alignment-Based Analysis**: Calculate fitness metrics showing:
   - Percentage of deliveries following planned sequence
   - Time deviation from planned schedule per stop
   - Distance deviation from optimal route

**Key Deviation Types to Monitor:**
- **Sequence Deviations**: Drivers reorganizing routes (possibly for good reasons)
- **Timing Deviations**: Systematic early/late patterns
- **Geographic Deviations**: Detours, possibly due to local knowledge or traffic
- **Activity Deviations**: Skipped scans, unofficial breaks

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators

**Primary KPIs:**

1. **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR)**
   - Formula: (Deliveries within promised window / Total deliveries) × 100%
   - Calculated from scanner timestamps vs. dispatch system time windows

2. **Average Service Time per Stop**
   - Formula: Average(Depart Customer - Arrive Customer timestamps)
   - Segmented by: package type, location type, time of day

3. **Productive vs. Non-Productive Time Ratio**
   - Productive: Travel between stops + customer service time
   - Non-productive: Idle time, maintenance, returns to depot

4. **Fuel Efficiency Score**
   - Formula: (Total packages delivered / Total fuel consumed) × distance factor
   - Derived from GPS distance calculations and fuel card data

5. **First-Attempt Delivery Success Rate**
   - Formula: (Successful first attempts / Total delivery attempts) × 100%

**Secondary KPIs:**
- Vehicle Utilization Rate (operating hours / available hours)
- Average Speed by Route Segment
- Overtime Hours per Driver
- Maintenance-Related Downtime

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques

**1. Performance Variant Analysis:**
- Cluster delivery routes by performance (high/medium/low OTDR)
- Compare process models for each cluster to identify differentiating patterns
- Use decision tree analysis to find attributes predicting poor performance

**2. Time-Based Bottleneck Mining:**
- Calculate waiting times between activities
- Identify locations/times with consistently high dwell times
- Apply queue mining to understand capacity constraints

**3. Resource-Based Analysis:**
- Compare driver performance controlling for route difficulty
- Identify vehicles with higher breakdown rates
- Analyze impact of vehicle type on delivery efficiency

**Quantifying Bottleneck Impact:**
- Calculate "bottleneck cost": (Additional time × hourly operational cost) + (Late delivery penalties)
- Simulate removal of bottlenecks to estimate potential improvements
- Prioritize based on frequency × impact matrix

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### Identified Root Causes and Validation Approaches

**1. Suboptimal Route Planning**
- **Analysis Method**: Compare actual travel distances/times with theoretical optimums
- **Process Mining Technique**: Trace clustering by route efficiency, identifying common characteristics of inefficient routes
- **Validation**: A/B testing with optimized routes on subset of vehicles

**2. Traffic Pattern Ignorance**
- **Analysis Method**: Correlate delays with time-of-day and location
- **Process Mining Technique**: Dotted chart analysis showing speed variations by hour/location
- **Validation**: Overlay traffic data APIs with identified slow zones

**3. Service Time Variability**
- **Analysis Method**: Statistical analysis of service times by customer type, package characteristics
- **Process Mining Technique**: Decision mining to find factors predicting long service times
- **Key Factors**: Building type (apartment vs. house), package size, payment requirements

**4. Failed Delivery Patterns**
- **Analysis Method**: Sequence analysis of failed delivery attempts
- **Process Mining Technique**: Pattern mining to identify common precursors to failures
- **Findings Focus**: Time windows too narrow, incorrect customer availability assumptions

**5. Vehicle Reliability Issues**
- **Analysis Method**: Correlation between vehicle age/mileage and unscheduled stops
- **Process Mining Technique**: Root cause analysis trees linking maintenance events to subsequent delays
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using event patterns to predict breakdown probability

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies
