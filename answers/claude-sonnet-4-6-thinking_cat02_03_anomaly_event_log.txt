# Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Event Log Anomaly Analysis

## Standard P2P Reference Flow

Before identifying anomalies, the expected sequence of activities is:

```
Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Purchase Requisition  Issue Purchase Order
 Receive Goods  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO
 Release Payment  Close Case
```

This sequence enforces key internal controls: **authorization before commitment, receipt before payment, and verification before disbursement.**

## Case-by-Case Analysis

###  Case 1001 — No Anomalies

| Step | Activity | Assessment |
|------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Create Purchase Requisition |  |
| 2 | Approve Purchase Requisition |  |
| 3 | Issue Purchase Order |  |
| 4 | Receive Goods |  |
| 5 | Vendor Invoice Received |  |
| 6 | Match Invoice to PO |  |
| 7 | Release Payment |  |
| 8 | Close Case |  |

**Case 1001 follows the standard P2P process exactly and serves as the baseline for comparison.**

###  Case 1002 — Multiple Critical Anomalies

| Step | Timestamp | Activity | Assessment |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 1 | 2024-02-01 08:30 | Create Purchase Requisition |  |
| 2 | 2024-02-01 08:40 | **Issue Purchase Order** |  Anomaly |
| 3 | 2024-02-03 07:00 | Vendor Invoice Received |  |
| 4 | 2024-02-03 07:15 | **Release Payment** |  Anomaly |
| 5 | 2024-02-03 08:00 | **Approve Purchase Requisition** |  Anomaly |
| 6 | 2024-02-04 09:00 | Receive Goods |  |
| 7 | 2024-02-05 08:00 | Match Invoice to PO |  |
| 8 | 2024-02-06 16:00 | Close Case |  |

#### Anomaly 1: Purchase Order Issued Before Requisition Approval
- **What happened:** The PO was issued at 08:40 on Feb 1, but the requisition was not approved until Feb 3 at 08:00 — **nearly 2 days later.**
- **Why it's problematic:** The approval step is a fundamental authorization control. Issuing a PO without prior approval means a financial commitment was made to a vendor **without any authorized oversight**, bypassing segregation of duties and creating unauthorized spending risk.

#### Anomaly 2: Payment Released Before Goods Receipt and Invoice Matching
- **What happened:** Payment was released on Feb 3 at 07:15, but goods were not received until Feb 4 and the invoice was not matched until Feb 5.
- **Why it's problematic:** This is a **severe control failure**. Releasing payment before:
  - Confirming goods were actually received (no proof of delivery)
  - Performing invoice-to-PO matching (no verification of correctness)
  
  This exposes the organization to paying for goods never received, overpayments, or outright fraud. The three-way match (PO + Goods Receipt + Invoice) exists precisely to prevent premature disbursement.

#### Anomaly 3: Approval Occurs After PO Issuance and Payment
- **What happened:** The requisition was "approved" after the PO was already issued and payment already released.
- **Why it's problematic:** The approval is rendered **completely meaningless** — it is a retrospective rubber stamp on actions already taken. This defeats the entire purpose of an authorization workflow and is a classic indicator of **control circumvention**, potentially masking fraudulent or unauthorized transactions.

###  Case 1003 — Payment Released Prematurely

| Step | Timestamp | Activity | Assessment |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 1 | 2024-02-02 09:00 | Create Purchase Requisition |  |
| 2 | 2024-02-02 09:10 | Approve Purchase Requisition |  |
| 3 | 2024-02-02 10:00 | Issue Purchase Order |  |
| 4 | 2024-02-08 11:00 | **Release Payment** |  Anomaly |
| 5 | 2024-02-09 12:00 | **Vendor Invoice Received** |  Anomaly |
| 6 | 2024-02-10 13:00 | **Receive Goods** |  Anomaly |
| 7 | 2024-02-11 14:00 | Match Invoice to PO |  |
| 8 | 2024-02-12 10:00 | Close Case |  |

#### Anomaly 1: Payment Released Before Vendor Invoice Was Received
- **What happened:** Payment went out on Feb 8, but the vendor's invoice wasn't received until Feb 9.
- **Why it's problematic:** Payment was made with **no invoice to validate** — no confirmed amount, no vendor billing reference, no legal document justifying the disbursement. This could lead to paying incorrect amounts, duplicate payments, or disbursements to fraudulent parties.

#### Anomaly 2: Payment Released Before Goods Were Received
- **What happened:** Payment went out on Feb 8, but goods didn't arrive until Feb 10.
- **Why it's problematic:** The organization paid for goods **before confirming they were delivered**. If goods arrive damaged, incomplete, or not at all, recovering funds already disbursed is significantly more difficult. This violates the core P2P principle of *"receive before you pay."*

#### Anomaly 3: Invoice Matching Performed After Payment
- **What happened:** The invoice-to-PO match occurred on Feb 11 — **three days after payment was already released.**
- **Why it's problematic:** The three-way matching process is the final verification gate before payment authorization. Performing it after payment makes it a **purely retrospective and ineffective control** — any discrepancies discovered cannot prevent the erroneous payment from going out.

###  Case 1004 — Goods Received Before Purchase Order Issued

| Step | Timestamp | Activity | Assessment |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 1 | 2024-02-05 10:00 | Create Purchase Requisition |  |
| 2 | 2024-02-05 10:15 | Approve Purchase Requisition |  |
| 3 | 2024-02-06 09:00 | **Receive Goods** |  Anomaly |
| 4 | 2024-02-06 09:15 | **Issue Purchase Order** |  Anomaly |
| 5 | 2024-02-07 08:00 | Vendor Invoice Received |  |
| 6 | 2024-02-07 08:30 | Match Invoice to PO |  |
| 7 | 2024-02-07 09:00 | Release Payment |  |
| 8 | 2024-02-08 11:00 | Close Case |  |

#### Anomaly: Goods Received Before Purchase Order Was Issued
- **What happened:** Goods were received at 09:00 on Feb 6, but the PO was only issued at 09:15 on the same day — **15 minutes later.**
- **Why it's problematic:** The Purchase Order is the **formal, legally binding agreement** between the buyer and the vendor defining quantity, price, terms, and delivery conditions. Receiving goods before a PO exists means:
  - There was **no contractual basis** for the delivery at the time of receipt
  - The receiving team had **no document to verify the shipment against** (correct items, quantities, specifications)
  - This is sometimes called *"maverick buying"* or an **unauthorized receipt**, suggesting either poor process discipline or a backdated PO created after the fact to justify an already-completed transaction
  - It undermines the organization's ability to dispute incorrect deliveries

## Summary of Anomalies

| Case | Anomaly | Severity | Primary Risk |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **1002** | PO issued without prior requisition approval |  Critical | Unauthorized commitment |
| **1002** | Payment released before goods receipt & invoice matching |  Critical | Fraudulent/erroneous payment |
| **1002** | Requisition approved retroactively (after PO and payment) |  Critical | Control bypass / fraud |
| **1003** | Payment released before invoice received |  Critical | Payment without legal basis |
| **1003** | Payment released before goods received |  Critical | Paying for undelivered goods |
| **1003** | Invoice matching performed after payment |  High | Controls rendered ineffective |
| **1004** | Goods received before PO issued |  High | Unauthorized receipt / maverick buying |

## Key Takeaways

> **The most dangerous pattern across these cases is the repeated occurrence of payment being released before the prerequisite verification steps (goods receipt, invoice receipt, and invoice matching) are completed.** In a well-controlled P2P process, no payment should ever be authorized until all three legs of the **three-way match** are satisfied:
> 1.  Purchase Order (approved commitment)
> 2.  Goods Receipt (confirmed delivery)
> 3.  Vendor Invoice (validated billing)

These anomalies collectively suggest risks including **fraud, financial loss, regulatory non-compliance, and weakened internal controls**, and would typically trigger an internal audit review or investigation under most corporate governance frameworks.
