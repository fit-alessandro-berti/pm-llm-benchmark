Here’s a Python dictionary representing the **Log Skeleton** for the order fulfillment process, incorporating declarative constraints based on typical workflow logic:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # Equivalence: Pairs of activities that must occur the same number of times
    "equivalence": {
        ("Generate Shipping Label", "Dispatch"),  # GSL and D must co-occur
        ("Invoice Customer", "Record Payment"),   # IC and RP must co-occur
    },
    # Always Before: If activity A occurs, B must have happened before
    "always_before": {
        ("Reserve Items", "Check Availability"),  # RI always after CA
        ("Pick Items", "Reserve Items"),          # PI always after RI
        ("Quality Check", "Pick Items"),          # QC always after PI
        ("Pack Order", "Quality Check"),          # PO always after QC
        ("Generate Shipping Label", "Pack Order"), # GSL always after PO
        ("Dispatch", "Generate Shipping Label"),   # D always after GSL
        ("Invoice Customer", "Dispatch"),         # IC always after D
        ("Record Payment", "Invoice Customer"),   # RP always after IC
    },
    # Always After: If activity A occurs, B must happen later
    "always_after": {
        ("Check Availability", "Reserve Items"),  # CA always before RI
        ("Reserve Items", "Pick Items"),          # RI always before PI
        ("Pick Items", "Quality Check"),          # PI always before QC
        ("Quality Check", "Pack Order"),          # QC always before PO
        ("Pack Order", "Generate Shipping Label"), # PO always before GSL
        ("Generate Shipping Label", "Dispatch"),   # GSL always before D
        ("Dispatch", "Invoice Customer"),         # D always before IC
        ("Invoice Customer", "Record Payment"),   # IC always before RP
    },
    # Never Together: Activities that cannot co-exist in the same case
    "never_together": set(),  # No strict exclusions in this scenario
    # Activity Occurrences: Bounds on how often an activity can occur
    "activ_freq": {
        "Receive Order": {1},        # RO occurs exactly once
        "Check Availability": {1},   # CA occurs exactly once
        "Reserve Items": {1},        # RI occurs exactly once
        "Pick Items": {1},           # PI occurs exactly once
        "Quality Check": {1},        # QC occurs exactly once
        "Pack Order": {1},           # PO occurs exactly once
        "Generate Shipping Label": {1},  # GSL occurs exactly once
        "Dispatch": {1},             # D occurs exactly once
        "Invoice Customer": {1},     # IC occurs exactly once
        "Record Payment": {1},       # RP occurs exactly once
    },
    # Directly-Follows: Activity B must immediately follow A
    "directly_follows": {
        ("Receive Order", "Check Availability"),  # RO → CA
        ("Check Availability", "Reserve Items"),  # CA → RI
        ("Reserve Items", "Pick Items"),          # RI → PI
        ("Pick Items", "Quality Check"),          # PI → QC
        ("Quality Check", "Pack Order"),          # QC → PO
        ("Pack Order", "Generate Shipping Label"), # PO → GSL
        ("Generate Shipping Label", "Dispatch"),   # GSL → D
        ("Dispatch", "Invoice Customer"),         # D → IC
        ("Invoice Customer", "Record Payment"),   # IC → RP
    },
}
```

### Key Constraints Explained:
1. **Equivalence**:  
   - `Generate Shipping Label` and `Dispatch` must occur together (1:1).  
   - `Invoice Customer` and `Record Payment` must occur together (1:1).  

2. **Temporal Dependencies**:  
   - `always_before` and `always_after` enforce the strict sequential flow (e.g., you can’t `Pick Items` before `Reserve Items`).  

3. **Directly-Follows**:  
   - Each step must immediately follow the previous one (e.g., `Quality Check` → `Pack Order`).  

4. **Occurrences**:  
   - All activities occur exactly once per case (no loops or optional steps in this simplified model).  

5. **Never Together**:  
   - Empty here, but could include constraints like "an order cannot be both expedited and standard."  

This model assumes a **linear workflow**; variations (e.g., loops for re-picking failed quality checks) would require adjusted constraints. Let me know if you'd like to refine any part!
