Okay, here's the DuckDB SQL query that fulfills the requirements of the prompt, along with a breakdown of how it works:

```sql
WITH
  CaseVariants AS (
    SELECT
      case_id,
      STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM
      event_log
    GROUP BY
      case_id
  ),
  VariantCounts AS (
    SELECT
      variant,
      COUNT(*) AS variant_count,
      RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS variant_rank
    FROM
      CaseVariants
    GROUP BY
      variant
  ),
  TopKVariants AS (
    SELECT
      variant
    FROM
      VariantCounts
    WHERE
      variant_rank <= :k -- Replace :k with the desired value for K. e.g., k=3 for top 3.
  ),
  TopKCaseIds AS (
    SELECT
      CaseVariants.case_id
    FROM
      CaseVariants
      JOIN TopKVariants ON CaseVariants.variant = TopKVariants.variant
  )
SELECT
  event_log.*
FROM
  event_log
  JOIN TopKCaseIds ON event_log.case_id = TopKCaseIds.case_id;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`CaseVariants` CTE:**
    *   This CTE groups events from the `event_log` by `case_id`.
    *   For each `case_id`, it uses `STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp)` to concatenate the activities into a single string, ordered by the `timestamp`. The `->` separator creates a visual representation of the activity sequence. This resulting string is named `variant`.
    * This effectively captures the full sequence of events (the variant) for each case.
2.  **`VariantCounts` CTE:**
    *   This CTE groups results from `CaseVariants` by the `variant`.
    *   It counts the number of cases (`COUNT(*)`) for each variant and assigns this count to the `variant_count` column.
    *   It uses `RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)` to assign a rank to each variant, where the most frequent variant gets rank 1, the second most frequent gets rank 2, and so on. This rank is stored in the `variant_rank` column.
3.  **`TopKVariants` CTE:**
    *   This CTE selects only the variants from `VariantCounts` that have a `variant_rank` less than or equal to `:k`. `:k` should be replaced with the desired value for K. For example, if we want the top 3 variants, replace `:k` with `3`.
    *   This results in a table that stores the process variants that are among the top k most frequent variants.
4.  **`TopKCaseIds` CTE:**
    * This CTE joins `CaseVariants` with `TopKVariants` on the `variant` to identify and store the case ids which belong to one of the top k variants.
5.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   This is the final result set.
    *   It selects all columns from the original `event_log` table.
    *   It joins `event_log` with `TopKCaseIds` based on the `case_id` to filter and return only those event log entries that belong to the case ids associated with the top K variants.
    *   This final select effectively filters down to only the events belonging to cases which are part of the top K variants and returns them.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Replace `:k`:**  Change the `:k` placeholder in the `TopKVariants` CTE to your desired value for `K` (e.g., `WHERE variant_rank <= 3` for top 3 variants).
2.  **Execute in DuckDB:**  Run this SQL query in your DuckDB environment. Ensure you have an event log table named `event_log` with columns `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`.

**Example (with `k=2`)**

Let's say you have the following `event_log`:

| case_id | activity |         timestamp         |
| :------ | :------- | :----------------------: |
|   1     |    A     | 2023-01-01 10:00:00    |
|   1     |    B     | 2023-01-01 11:00:00    |
|   1     |    C     | 2023-01-01 12:00:00    |
|   2     |    A     | 2023-01-01 10:00:00    |
|   2     |    B     | 2023-01-01 11:00:00    |
|   3     |    A     | 2023-01-01 10:00:00    |
|   3     |    C     | 2023-01-01 12:00:00    |
|   4     |    A     | 2023-01-01 10:00:00    |
|   4     |    B     | 2023-01-01 11:00:00    |

After running the query with `:k` replaced by `2`, you would get the following result:

| case_id | activity |         timestamp         |
| :------ | :------- | :----------------------: |
|   1     |    A     | 2023-01-01 10:00:00    |
|   1     |    B     | 2023-01-01 11:00:00    |
|   1     |    C     | 2023-01-01 12:00:00    |
|   2     |    A     | 2023-01-01 10:00:00    |
|   2     |    B     | 2023-01-01 11:00:00    |
|   4     |    A     | 2023-01-01 10:00:00    |
|   4     |    B     | 2023-01-01 11:00:00    |

**Explanation of Example:**

1. **CaseVariants CTE:**
   - Case 1 has variant "A->B->C".
   - Case 2 has variant "A->B".
   - Case 3 has variant "A->C".
   - Case 4 has variant "A->B".
2. **VariantCounts CTE:**
   - Variant "A->B" has a count of 2.
   - Variant "A->B->C" has a count of 1.
   - Variant "A->C" has a count of 1.
   - "A->B" gets rank 1 and the other variants both get rank 2.
3.  **`TopKVariants` CTE:**
    *   Selects the top 2 variants, which are "A->B" and "A->B->C".
4. **`TopKCaseIds` CTE:**
    * selects case id 1 (A->B->C), case id 2 (A->B), and case id 4 (A->B) since they are part of the top 2 variants.
5. **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   Selects all rows from the `event_log` where the `case_id` is present in the result of the `TopKCaseIds` CTE. This filters to the events of case ids 1, 2, and 4.

This SQL query should help you efficiently analyze your event log and identify relevant cases based on their process variants using DuckDB.
