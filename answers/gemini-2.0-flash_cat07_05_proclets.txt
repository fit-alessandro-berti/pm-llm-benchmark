The image consists of three parts:

**(a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels:** This is the main part of the visualization. It appears to be a process flow diagram describing the interaction between two 'proclet' classes - "Lab visit" and "Lab test."

*   The "Lab visit" proclet starts with "Order entry" performed by a doctor. It proceeds with steps such as "Take blood sample" (by a lab assistant), "Receive result", "Judge results", and "Do tests again". The path eventually concludes with "Send report".
*   The "Lab test" proclet involves steps such as "Perform test", "Make report", "Perform test again", and "Provide updated report".
*   There are dashed rectangles labeled "Order system" and "HIS". These seem to represent communication channels through which the two proclet classes interact. The numbers beside arrows within the dashed rectangles e.g., "(1,*)" and "(1,1)", represent the cardinality of these relationships/interactions.
*   There are roles associated with different process steps, like "doctor" and "lab assistant" for the "Lab visit" process and "chemical analyst" for the "Lab test" process.

**(b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes:** This is a simplified class diagram depicting the relationship between the "Lab visit" and "Lab test" classes. It shows that a "Lab visit" requires one or more "Lab test" instances, and a "Lab test" is related to a single "Lab visit". The cardinality is expressed as 1..1 (one-to-one) and 1..\* (one-to-many).

**(c) Example of a performative:** This is a table showing an example of a performative message. It contains the following information:

*   **Time:** 11:00
*   **Channel:** Order system
*   **Sender:** Lab visit - John
*   **Receivers:** Lab test - HGB, John
*   **Action:** Create
*   **Content:** "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
*   **Scope:** Private
*   **Direction:** OUT

The table illustrates the structure and contents of a message that is exchanged between the two proclet classes through the "Order system" channel.

In summary, the visualization presents a model of the interaction between "Lab visit" and "Lab test" processes, illustrating their relationship through a process flow diagram, a simplified class diagram, and an example of a message exchanged between them.
