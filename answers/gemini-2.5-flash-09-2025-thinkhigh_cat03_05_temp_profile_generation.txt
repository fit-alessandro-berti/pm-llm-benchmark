The temporal profile is constructed by estimating the elapsed time (in seconds) between the completion of one activity and the start of a subsequent activity, based on standard lead times, operational complexity, and inventory management typical for global high-tech supply chains.

## Temporal Profile Dictionary

The times are expressed in seconds.

| Pair | Estimated Average Time (seconds) | Estimated Standard Deviation (seconds) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short Distance (Hours/Days)** | | | |
| `('PT', 'PK')` | 7,200 | 3,600 | Testing completion to Packaging start (Few hours buffer) |
| `('PK', 'WS')` | 3,600 | 1,800 | Packaging complete to immediate Warehouse Storage |
| `('RC', 'QI')` | 43,200 | 21,600 | Components received to Quality Inspection start (12 hours) |
| `('QI', 'CA')` | 86,400 | 43,200 | Post-inspection inventory staging (1 day) |
| `('SS', 'OP')` | 172,800 | 86,400 | Contract finalization and Order Placement (2 days) |
| **Medium Distance (Days/Weeks)** | | | |
| `('CA', 'PT')` | 432,000 | 172,800 | Component Assembly duration (5 days production time) |
| `('WS', 'DT')` | 1,209,600 | 604,800 | Waiting for optimal shipping batch/schedule (1-2 weeks variable) |
| `('DT', 'AS')` | 864,000 | 432,000 | Distribution and shipment time until product is received (10 days) |
| `('RC', 'CA')` | 260,000 | 90,000 | From receiving to start of assembly (inspection + staging) |
| **Long Distance (Weeks/Months)** | | | |
| `('OP', 'RC')` | 3,888,000 | 864,000 | Supplier Lead Time (45 days avg., high variability) |
| `('SS', 'QI')` | 4,100,000 | 950,000 | Total procurement and initial handling (dominated by lead time) |
| `('CA', 'DT')` | 1,650,000 | 700,000 | Post-assembly manufacturing, packaging, and storage wait (dominated by WS wait) |
| `('RC', 'PK')` | 580,000 | 150,000 | Full manufacturing pipeline (RC to Packaging) |
| `('SS', 'DT')` | 6,000,000 | 1,300,000 | Procurement start to Shipment start (69 days approx.) |
| `('SS', 'AS')` | 6,860,000 | 1,500,000 | Full end-to-end cycle time (approx. 80 days) |
