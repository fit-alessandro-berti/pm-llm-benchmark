1. What strategic considerations drove the decision to source critical components from geographically dispersed suppliers, and how might consolidating or diversifying suppliers change the risk–cost balance?

2. How is “market research” translated into concrete product and volume decisions in R&D and procurement, and where are the biggest communication gaps between marketing, engineering, and supply chain?

3. In what ways could early supplier involvement (e.g., during prototype design) reduce lead times, costs, or defect rates later in the process?

4. How are risks such as geopolitical tensions, export controls, or natural disasters in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the USA assessed and mitigated when planning component sourcing?

5. What criteria determine when to use air freight versus cargo ship for different markets, and how often are those criteria revisited as fuel prices, demand volatility, and sustainability targets change?

6. How could real-time demand sensing (e.g., from e-commerce data or POS systems) be integrated earlier in the process to dynamically adjust production, shipping modes, or regional allocations?

7. What are the trade-offs between centralizing assembly in Malaysia versus regional assembly, in terms of lead time, risk, flexibility, IP protection, and total landed cost?

8. How are quality thresholds and rework versus scrap decisions defined, and what mechanisms ensure that quality control is aligned with brand positioning and warranty cost targets?

9. In what ways could automation, AI, or IoT technologies enhance visibility and decision-making at key gateways (e.g., quality checks, freight mode selection, customs preparation)?

10. How are performance metrics (e.g., OTIF, cycle time, yield, cost per unit, carbon footprint) currently used to evaluate each major phase, and where do these metrics create unintended behaviors or local optimizations?

11. What is the escalation path when a bottleneck arises (e.g., component shortage, customs delays, warehouse congestion), and how is decision-making authority distributed across regions and functions?

12. How effectively are stakeholders across R&D, procurement, logistics, finance, marketing, and sales aligned on shared KPIs, and where do conflicting incentives create friction in the process?

13. How might introducing postponement or late customization (e.g., regional software loads, packaging, accessories) alter the design of the distribution and warehousing steps?

14. What mechanisms exist to continuously learn from disruptions, quality issues, or demand forecast errors, and how are these insights fed back into process redesign and supplier negotiations?

15. How is the balance determined between holding higher safety stocks at regional distribution centers versus relying on faster replenishment from the assembly plant?

16. In what ways could collaborative planning with key retailers, carriers, and logistics partners improve forecast accuracy, reduce bullwhip effects, or optimize transportation choices?

17. How are regulatory and compliance requirements (e.g., data privacy, safety standards, environmental regulations) anticipated and embedded upstream rather than handled reactively at customs?

18. What scenarios or stress tests are run to understand how the supply chain would behave under extreme conditions (e.g., border closures, component bans, sudden demand spikes), and what contingency playbooks exist?

19. How are customer feedback, product returns, and after-sales service data integrated into decisions about future product design, supplier selection, and process improvements?

20. If the company were to prioritize sustainability as highly as cost and speed, which elements of the current process flow (sourcing, transportation modes, packaging, locations) would need to be fundamentally redesigned, and how would that alter competitive positioning?
