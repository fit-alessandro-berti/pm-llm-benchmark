To construct the two POWL models as described, we would proceed by setting up the transitions, exclusions, loops, and conditions based on the tasks in the hiring process of GlobalTeq Solutions. We'll use the pm4py library to define these processes as specified.

### Model 1: POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model, the process incorporates an XOR branch that potentially biases some candidates based on community affiliations.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops for data completeness
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define XOR for cultural fit and community affiliation check
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the overall process
powl_model_with_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop, SkillAssessment, cultural_xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
powl_model_with_bias.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop)
powl_model_with_bias.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, SkillAssessment)
powl_model_with_bias.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_xor)
powl_model_with_bias.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, ManagerialReview)
powl_model_with_bias.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### Model 2: POWL Model Without Unfairness

Here, all candidates experience the same cultural fit check, removing the potential bias from community affiliations.

```python
# Use the same transitions for simplicity
# We only need to adjust the XOR to not include community affiliations

# Define the overall fair process
powl_model_no_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
powl_model_no_bias.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop)
powl_model_no_bias.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, SkillAssessment)
powl_model_no_bias.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
powl_model_no_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
powl_model_no_bias.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

These two models illustrate how the process flow can be adjusted to either include or exclude potential biases. The pathways defined by the `OperatorPOWL` objects reflect the choices that either introduce or neutralize unfair advantages.
