To mitigate bias in the loan application process, we introduce new DECLARE constraints that enforce fairness by ensuring that sensitive attributes (such as `ApplicantRace`, `ApplicantGender`, and `ApplicantAge`) do not directly or indirectly lead to biased decisions (e.g., `Approve`, `Reject`, or `RequestAdditionalInfo`). These constraints ensure that decision steps are properly reviewed or mediated by fairness checks, especially when sensitive information is involved.

###  **Key Strategies Used:**

1. **Coexistence Constraints**  
   Ensure that decisions involving sensitive demographics (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Senior`) are always accompanied by a `ManualReview`, acting as a fairness check.

2. **Response / Succession Constraints**  
   Require that any decision (e.g., `Approve`, `Reject`) must be preceded by a `BiasMitigationCheck` if sensitive attributes were disclosed (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`).

3. **Non-succession Constraints**  
   Prevent direct transitions from sensitive attribute checks (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to final decisions (e.g., `Reject`) to avoid immediate bias.

```python

        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}

    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure manual review for decisions based on sensitive demographics
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},

    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure a bias mitigation check before any decision if sensitive info was collected
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},

    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure decision steps are preceded by a fairness check
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},

        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},

###  **Rationale for Bias Mitigation Constraints**

| Constraint Type | Example | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Coexistence** | `"Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {...}}` | Ensures that decisions involving minority applicants are always manually reviewed to catch and prevent bias. |
| **Response** | `"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {...}}` | Ensures that after checking sensitive attributes, a bias mitigation step is always performed before any decision. |
| **Succession** | `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {...}}` | Ensures that any decision (like Approve or Reject) is always preceded by a fairness check if sensitive info was used. |
| **Non-succession** | `"CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {...}}` | Prevents a direct transition from collecting sensitive data (e.g., race) to a decision (e.g., reject) without fairness checks. |

###  **Conclusion**

These constraints make the loan application process more **transparent**, **auditable**, and **less prone to discrimination**. They enforce procedural fairness by ensuring that decisions involving sensitive attributes are properly reviewed and mediated by checks that reduce the risk of automated or unconscious bias.
