We need to produce a DuckDB SQL query that returns all events from event_log except those cases that contain the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' with no other events in between, and where time difference between Create Order and Confirm Order > 5 days.

We need to identify such case_ids, then exclude them. Approach: Use window functions to order events per case by timestamp. Then for each event, compute next two activities? We can use lag/lead or row_number partitioned by case_id order by timestamp. Then we can identify rows where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', next activity = 'Create Order', next2 activity = 'Confirm Order'. Also ensure no other event in between: since we are using consecutive rows, that's satisfied.

Then compute time difference between Create and Confirm: we need timestamps of those two events. We can join the table onto itself or use window functions again.

Simpler: Use CTE to get candidate sequences:

WITH seq AS (
SELECT
e.case_id,
e.timestamp as apr_ts,
lead(e.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY e.case_id ORDER BY e.timestamp) as create_ts,
lead(e.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY e.case_id ORDER BY e.timestamp) as create_act,
lead(lead(e.activity),1) OVER (PARTITION BY e.case_id ORDER BY e.timestamp) as confirm_act,
lead(lead(e.timestamp),1) OVER (PARTITION BY e.case_id ORDER BY e.timestamp) as confirm_ts
FROM event_log e
)
SELECT case_id FROM seq
WHERE activity='Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND create_act='Create Order'
AND confirm_act='Confirm Order'
AND date_diff('day', create_ts, confirm_ts)>5

But we also need to ensure that there is no other event in between; using consecutive leads ensures that.

However we used only one row per sequence start; but if there are multiple sequences per case, each will be captured separately.

Now final query: Exclude these cases:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
SELECT case_id FROM seq WHERE ... conditions ...
);

But note that seq uses alias for activity? We didn't include original activity column; we should include it. Let's rewrite:

WITH seq AS (
SELECT
l.,
LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS act2,
LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS ts2,
LEAD(LEAD(activity)) OVER (...) AS act3,
LEAD(LEAD(timestamp)) OVER (...) AS ts3
FROM event_log l
)
SELECT DISTINCT l.
FROM seq s
JOIN event_log l ON l.case_id=s.case_id AND l.activity=s.activity AND l.timestamp=s.timestamp;

Wait easier: just compute candidate cases:

WITH candidates AS (
SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id
FROM (
SELECT
l.*,
LEAD(activity,1,'') OVER (...) as act2,
LEAD(timestamp,1,NULL)::timestamp as ts2,
LEAD(activity,2,'') over (...) as act3,
LEAD(timestamp,2,NULL)::timestamp as ts3
FROM event_log l
) s
WHERE s.activity='Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND s.act2='Create Order'
AND s.act3='Confirm Order'
AND date_diff('day',s.ts2,s.ts3)>5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log ev
WHERE ev.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM candidates);

Need to cast date_diff properly; DuckDB's date_diff function signature is date_diff(unit,text,date1,date2). So use date_diff('day',ts2,ts3). Ensure ts values not null.

Also ensure ordering by timestamp within partition ensures consecutive events.

Edge cases: If there are duplicate timestamps? But fine.

Let's craft final query accordingly with proper formatting and comments maybe not needed but okay.

Return all columns from original table except excluded ones. Provide final SQL code block with language duckdb or sql. Use double dollar signs for math? Not needed here because no math expressions except maybe date diff but that's function call not math expression requiring LaTeX. So fine.

Let's produce final answer accordingly.

**DuckDB query**

```sql
-- Identify the cases that contain the exact three‑event sequence  
-- followed by a gap of more than five days.
WITH candidate_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT ev.case_id
    FROM (
        -- For every row keep its two following rows in the same process instance.
        SELECT 
            ev.*,

            -- Next two activities & timestamps.
            LEAD(ev.activity , 1 , '')          OVER (PARTITION BY ev.case_id ORDER BY ev."timestamp") AS nxt_activity_1 ,
            LEAD(ev."timestamp", 1 , NULL)::timestamp  
                                            OVER (PARTITION BY ev.case_id ORDER BY ev."timestamp") AS nxt_timestamp_1 ,

            LEAD(ev.activity , 2 , '')          OVER (PARTITION BY ev.case_id ORDER BY ev."timestamp") AS nxt_activity_2 ,
            LEAD(ev."timestamp", 2 , NULL)::timestamp  
                                            OVER (PARTITION BY ev.case_id ORDER BY ev."timestamp") AS nxt_timestamp_2

        FROM "event_log" ev

    ) sub

    WHERE sub.activity           = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'      -- first step of the sequence  
      AND sub.nxt_activity_1     = 'Create Order'                       -- second step immediately after  
      AND sub.nxt_activity_2     = 'Confirm Order'                      -- third step immediately after  

      /* time gap larger than five days */
      AND DATE_DIFF('day',
                    sub.nxt_timestamp_1::date ,
                    sub.nxt_timestamp_2::date ) > 5

)

-- Return *all* events **except** those belonging to the offending cases.
SELECT *
FROM "event_log"
WHERE "case_ID" NOT IN (SELECT "case_ID" FROM candidate_cases);
```

The CTE `candidate_cases` finds every `case_ID` where an **exactly consecutive** triple of activities appears (`Approve Purchase Requisition → Create Order → Confirm Order`) and where the elapsed time between *Create Order* and *Confirm Order* exceeds five days (`DATE_DIFF`).  

The outer query simply filters out any rows whose `case_ID` is present in this list—so you get every remaining log entry from all other process instances.
