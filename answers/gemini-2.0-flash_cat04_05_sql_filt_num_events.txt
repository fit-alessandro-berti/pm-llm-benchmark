```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

This query first calculates the number of events for each `case_id` using a subquery.  The `GROUP BY case_id` clause groups the events by case, and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` filters out any cases with more than six events.  The outer query then selects all columns from the `event_log` table, but only for the `case_id`s that were returned by the subquery (i.e., the cases with six or fewer events). This ensures that only the events belonging to the desired cases are included in the final result.
