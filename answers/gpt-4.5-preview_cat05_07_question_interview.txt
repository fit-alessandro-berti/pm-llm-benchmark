6. If the inspection process identifies significant issues or required maintenance, how would that impact your timeline, and what adjustments do you typically make with regards to marketing and leasing schedules?

7. What kind of policies, conditions, or lease terms do landlords often request that might require special approvals or exceptions on your end?

8. You mentioned exceptions like special insurance requirements or custom lease clauses—can you give examples of particular instances where these exceptions occurred, and how your team handled them?

13. If an issue arises after the onboarding is complete (such as a discrepancy between marketing listings and actual property conditions or tenant complaints), how is accountability assigned, and how is resolution typically coordinated among your teams?

14. Are there particular steps in the onboarding process that often cause bottlenecks or challenges, and have you developed best practices to mitigate or overcome these challenges?

15. Lastly, how do you currently evaluate the effectiveness of your onboarding process—do you have set KPIs, benchmarks, tenant and landlord satisfaction measures, or other mechanisms to gauge success and continually improve the onboarding experience?
