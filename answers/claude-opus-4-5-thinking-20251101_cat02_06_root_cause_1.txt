# Customer Support Ticket Resolution Analysis

## 1. Case Resolution Time Comparison

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Duration | Status |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| 101 | 2024-03-01 08:00 | 2024-03-01 10:15 | **2h 15m** |  Fast |
| 102 | 2024-03-01 08:05 | 2024-03-02 09:15 | **25h 10m** |  Slow |
| 103 | 2024-03-01 08:10 | 2024-03-01 09:30 | **1h 20m** |  Fast |
| 104 | 2024-03-01 08:20 | 2024-03-02 08:30 | **24h 10m** |  Slow |
| 105 | 2024-03-01 08:25 | 2024-03-03 09:30 | **49h 5m** |  Very Slow |

**Average Resolution Time:** ~20.4 hours

**Significantly Delayed Cases:** Cases 102, 104, and 105 (all exceeding 24 hours vs. ~2 hours for fast cases)

### Key Root Causes Identified

####  **Factor 1: Escalation to Level-2 Causes Major Delays**

| Case | Wait Time After Escalation to Next Activity |
|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 102 | 2 hours 30 minutes |
| 105 | **28 hours** (Escalate  Investigation) |

**Insight:** Both escalated cases (102 and 105) experienced significant waiting times after escalation. Case 105 waited **over a full day** just for Level-2 investigation to begin, suggesting:
- Limited Level-2 agent availability
- Poor handoff procedures between teams
- Possible queue backlog at the specialized team

---

####  **Factor 2: Long Waiting Time Between Assignment and Investigation**

| Case | Assign to Investigate Duration | Outcome |
|------|-------------------------------|---------|
| 101 | 40 min | Fast resolution |
| 103 | 15 min | Fast resolution |
| 104 | **3 hours 30 min** | Delayed resolution |
| 102 | 2h 30m (before escalation) | Delayed resolution |

**Insight:** Case 104 had no escalation but still took 24+ hours. The bottleneck was a **3.5-hour gap** between assignment and investigation, indicating:
- Agent workload imbalance
- Ticket sitting idle in agent queue
- Possible lack of prioritization mechanisms

---

####  **Factor 3: Overnight/Cross-Day Investigation Delays**

| Case | Investigate  Resolve Duration | Spans Overnight? |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| 101 | 1 hour | No |
| 103 | 30 min | No |
| 102 | 19 hours | **Yes** |
| 104 | 19 hours | **Yes** |
| 105 | 19 hours (after 2nd investigation) | **Yes** |

**Insight:** All three slow cases had investigation that spanned overnight, resulting in ~19-hour delays. This suggests:
- No after-hours support coverage
- Work stopping at end of business day
- Tickets "aging" in queue overnight

## 3. Summary of Patterns

```
                    Fast Cases (101, 103)     Slow Cases (102, 104, 105)
                         
Escalation:         No                        Yes (102, 105)
AssignInvestigate: 15-40 min                 2.5-3.5 hours
Cross-day:          No                        Yes (all three)
Total Time:         1-2 hours                 24-49 hours
```

## 4. Recommendations

| Issue | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Level-2 Bottleneck** | Increase Level-2 staffing or cross-train Level-1 agents for common escalation scenarios | Reduce escalation wait times from 28 hours to under 2 hours |
| **Agent Queue Delays** | Implement workload balancing and real-time queue monitoring dashboards | Reduce assign-to-investigate time for all tickets |
| **Overnight Stagnation** | Consider staggered shifts or on-call rotation for critical tickets | Enable 24-hour progression on high-priority issues |
| **Escalation Handoff** | Establish SLAs for escalation response (e.g., Level-2 must pick up within 1 hour) | Standardize and improve predictability |
| **Early Escalation Detection** | Use ticket categorization at triage to identify likely-escalation cases early | Route to Level-2 proactively, avoiding double investigation |

---

## 5. Conclusion

The primary drivers of long resolution times are:

1. **Escalation-related delays** — particularly the extended wait for Level-2 agents (up to 28 hours)
2. **Pre-investigation waiting** — tickets sitting idle after assignment (3+ hours)
3. **Lack of overnight coverage** — causing 19-hour gaps in processing

Cases **101 and 103** demonstrate that the baseline process can resolve tickets in **under 2.5 hours** when there are no escalations and activities flow smoothly. Addressing the Level-2 capacity and queue management issues would likely bring the slower cases closer to this benchmark.
