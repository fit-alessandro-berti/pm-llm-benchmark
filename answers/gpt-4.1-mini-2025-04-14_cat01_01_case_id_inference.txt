Let's analyze the event log carefully to group events that belong to the same "case" (i.e., the same patient's hospital journey). We will use the following clues:

- **patient_age and patient_gender** (unique identifiers for patients across events)
- **department and resource** (correlated with activities)
- **activity flow and timing** (logical sequence of process steps)
- **additional_info** (specific details to link related events)

### Step 1: Identify unique patients by patient_age and patient_gender combination

From the data, three distinct patients appear:

1. Patient A: Age 45, Gender M
2. Patient B: Age 62, Gender F
3. Patient C: Age 28, Gender M

---

### Step 2: Assign events to patients based on patient_age and patient_gender

#### Patient A: 45-year-old Male

Events with patient_age=45 and gender=M:

- (1) Register patient, ER, Admin Clerk, 08:05:13
- (4) Initial triage, ER, Nurse Joy, 08:10:50
- (7) X-ray imaging, Radiology, Radiology Tech, 08:15:42
- (12) Doctor consultation, ER, Dr. Lee, 08:23:10 — diagnosis=hairline_fracture
- (15) Patient discharged, ER, Ward Clerk, 08:30:05 — followup=outpatient_clinic

Logical flow:

Register  Initial triage  X-ray  Doctor consultation  Discharge

---

#### Patient B: 62-year-old Female

Events with patient_age=62 and gender=F:

- (2) Register patient, ER, Admin Clerk, 08:07:02
- (5) Initial triage, ER, Nurse Mark, 08:12:29
- (8) Lab test requested, ER, Dr. Smith, 08:16:10 — blood_panel
- (10) Lab test completed, Laboratory, Lab Technician, 08:20:27 — results=normal_levels
- (11) Doctor consultation, ER, Dr. Smith, 08:22:54 — diagnosis=minor_infection
- (14) Prescription created, ER, Dr. Smith, 08:27:00 — medication=antibiotics
- (17) Patient discharged, ER, Ward Clerk, 08:35:29 — followup=pharmacy_pickup

Logical flow:

Register  Initial triage  Lab test requested  Lab test completed  Doctor consultation  Prescription  Discharge

---

#### Patient C: 28-year-old Male

Events with patient_age=28 and gender=M:

- (3) Register patient, Surgery, Admin Clerk, 08:07:15
- (6) Doctor consultation, Surgery, Dr. Lee, 08:13:00 — scheduled_knee_surgery
- (9) Surgery preparation, Surgery, Surgical Nurse, 08:16:45
- (13) Surgery performed, Surgery, Dr. Lee, 08:25:19 — arthroscopy
- (16) Recovery room, Surgery, Recovery Nurse, 08:31:37 — condition=stable
- (18) Patient discharged, Surgery, Ward Clerk, 08:40:13 — followup=physiotherapy_sessions

Logical flow:

Register  Doctor consultation  Surgery preparation  Surgery performed  Recovery  Discharge

---

### Step 3: Final case groupings

| Case ID | Patient Age | Gender | Events (by line #)                                | Key notes                      |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1       | 45          | M      | 1, 4, 7, 12, 15                                  | ER registration, fracture case |
| 2       | 62          | F      | 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17                          | ER registration, infection workup |
| 3       | 28          | M      | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18                              | Surgery registration, planned knee surgery |

---

## Summary:

- **Case 1:** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 belong to the 45-year-old male with a hairline fracture.
- **Case 2:** Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 belong to the 62-year-old female with minor infection.
- **Case 3:** Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 belong to the 28-year-old male undergoing scheduled knee surgery.
