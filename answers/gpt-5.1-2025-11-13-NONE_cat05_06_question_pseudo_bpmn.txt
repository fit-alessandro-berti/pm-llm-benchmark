1. What criteria should drive the decision to source specific components from particular countries, and how often should these sourcing choices be revisited in light of geopolitical or market changes?

2. How could the market research phase better integrate real-time data (e.g., social media sentiment, competitor launches) to more dynamically influence R&D and volume planning?

3. In what ways might the R&D stage collaborate more closely with procurement and logistics to design smartphones that are more resilient to supply disruptions and cost volatility?

4. What risk mitigation strategies could be built into the parallel component-sourcing steps to reduce dependency on any single supplier, region, or transportation mode?

5. How might the process accommodate sudden shocks, such as export bans or natural disasters in key supplier countries, without significantly disrupting the production schedule?

6. What are the trade-offs between centralizing assembly in a single plant (Malaysia) versus distributed assembly hubs, in terms of cost, lead time, risk, and quality control?

7. How could predictive analytics or digital twins be used to simulate the impact of changes (e.g., new supplier, new transportation route) before they are implemented in the real process?

8. To what extent should quality thresholds at the “Quality Checks & Diagnostics” gateway be adjusted based on market segment (premium vs. budget), and who should make that decision?

9. How might the criteria for “Rework or Scrap” be optimized to balance cost, environmental impact, brand reputation, and time-to-market?

10. What factors should inform the split between air freight and cargo ship (e.g., product life cycle stage, margin, seasonality), and how might this decision be continuously optimized?

11. How can customs clearance and regulatory compliance be designed as a proactive, integrated part of product design and labeling, rather than a downstream bottleneck?

12. What KPIs should be tracked at regional distribution centers to provide early warning signals of misalignment between supply and demand across different markets?

13. How might collaboration and information-sharing between regional DCs improve global inventory balancing and reduce both stockouts and excess inventory?

14. In what ways could local warehousing, retail distribution, e-commerce fulfillment, and VIP/pre-order shipments be more tightly synchronized to offer a unified customer experience?

15. How should communication and governance be structured among stakeholders (R&D, procurement, logistics, marketing, finance, and regional leaders) to ensure aligned decision-making across the entire chain?

16. What role should sustainability metrics (e.g., carbon footprint, waste from scrapped units, packaging materials) play in evaluating the performance of each step in the process?

17. How could the “Monitor Inventory & Sales Forecast” task better integrate external signals (economy, competitor moves, promotions) to anticipate demand inflection points?

18. When demand changes trigger “Adjust Orders to Suppliers,” how can the company ensure suppliers are partners in flexibility rather than just transactional vendors?

19. What governance mechanisms should define when to move from “Adjust Orders” to “Proceed to Next Sales Cycle,” and how can bias or inertia in these decisions be minimized?

20. How might continuous improvement (e.g., lean, Six Sigma, agile practices) be embedded into this end-to-end process so that lessons learned in one cycle systematically inform the next?
