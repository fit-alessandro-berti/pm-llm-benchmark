1. What criteria and data sources should drive the initial “Conduct Market Research” task to ensure that R&D designs a smartphone that truly aligns with regional customer needs and price sensitivities?

2. How might the design of the smartphone prototype be influenced if supply chain constraints (e.g., limited chip capacity or geopolitical risks) were considered as early as the R&D stage?

3. What are the strategic reasons for using multiple geographically dispersed suppliers (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, USA), and under what conditions might supplier consolidation or nearshoring be more advantageous?

4. How should the company balance single-sourcing high-tech components for quality and consistency versus multi-sourcing for resilience and risk mitigation?

5. In what ways could real-time visibility into supplier production status, logistics, and inventory levels change the timing and sequencing of the “Secure Components” and “Ship Components” steps?

6. How could the assembly plant’s 24/7 operation be dynamically adjusted based on demand forecasts, component availability, and labor constraints, rather than running at a fixed capacity?

7. What risk factors (e.g., quality variability by supplier, transportation delays, geopolitical events) should influence the design of the quality checks and the thresholds for “Rework or Scrap”?

8. How might predictive analytics or machine learning be integrated into the quality control step to reduce rework/scrap rates and identify upstream process improvements?

9. What strategic considerations determine whether smartphones are shipped by air or sea (cost, lead time, carbon footprint, market urgency), and how could these decisions be made dynamically rather than by static rules?

10. How could customs clearance and regulatory compliance be redesigned or pre-processed (e.g., advanced documentation, pre-clearance programs) to minimize delays and variability in lead times?

11. What collaboration mechanisms with logistics providers and customs authorities could improve reliability and transparency in cross-border movements, and how should these be reflected in the process?

12. How might regional distribution center locations and capacities be re-evaluated in light of shifting demand patterns, trade policies, or sustainability goals?

13. What are the trade-offs between holding more inventory at regional distribution centers versus using faster, more flexible transportation modes to replenish from the assembly plant?

14. How can the processes for local warehousing, distribution to retailers, e-commerce fulfillment, and VIP/pre-order shipments be better integrated to reduce duplication of effort and inventory fragmentation?

15. Which key performance indicators (KPIs) should be used to measure the effectiveness of the end-to-end process (e.g., order fulfillment lead time, perfect order rate, inventory turns, carbon emissions), and how should they be prioritized?

16. How can feedback from retailers, e-commerce platforms, and end customers be systematically captured and fed back into earlier stages such as market research, component sourcing, and quality control?

17. What scenario planning or stress-testing approaches could be used to assess the resilience of the supply chain to disruptions (e.g., factory shutdowns, port closures, export controls), and how should the process be adapted based on those insights?

18. How should decision rights and escalation paths be defined across functions (procurement, R&D, manufacturing, logistics, sales) to ensure timely and aligned decisions at the “Adjust Orders to Suppliers” gateway?

19. In what ways could digital twins or process simulation models help identify bottlenecks, test alternative flows (e.g., different distribution strategies), and support strategic investments in capacity or technology?

20. How might sustainability and ESG considerations (e.g., supplier labor practices, emissions, e-waste) be embedded as explicit decision criteria at key gateways, and how would that change supplier selection, logistics choices, and product design?
