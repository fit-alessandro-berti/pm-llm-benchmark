Based on the provided process variants, I'll attempt to describe the underlying process, highlighting its key elements, flows, and decision points. Please note that some interpretations might be subjective due to the complexity and variability of the data.

**Process Name:** Employee Declaration and Payment Process

**Primary Objective:** To facilitate the submission, approval, and subsequent payment for employee declarations.

**Key Process Elements:**

1. **Declaration Submission**: The process initiates with an employee submitting a declaration.
2. **Approval Workflow**: The declaration undergoes one or more approval stages involving various roles (e.g., Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, Supervisor).
3. **Payment Handling**: Successfully approved declarations lead to a payment being handled.

**Main Process Flow:**

1. **Declaration Submission by Employee**
2. **Initial Approval Check**
	* Either **Approved by Administration** ( proceeds to 3 )
	* Or **Rejected by Administration** ( may loop back to submission after employee rejection, or terminate )
3. **Additional Approval Stages (if required)**
	* Involving **Pre-Approver**, **Budget Owner**, or direct **Final Approval by Supervisor**
4. **Final Approval by Supervisor**
5. **Request Payment**
6. **Payment Handled**

**Decision Points and Variabilities:**

* **Initial Rejection by Administration**: Leads to employee rejection, potential resubmission, and possible multiple cycles of this loop.
* **Approval Pathways**:
	+ Direct Final Approval by Supervisor (bypassing intermediate approvals)
	+ Involvement of Pre-Approver before Supervisor
	+ Mandatory Approval by Budget Owner before Supervisor
* **Rejection at Later Stages**: Rejections by Pre-Approver, Budget Owner, or Supervisor can lead to employee rejection and resubmission, potentially following a different approval pathway.
* **Missing Approvals/Information**: In some variants, declarations are rejected due to "MISSING" approvals/information, indicating potential process deviations or exceptions.

**Observations and Potential Improvement Areas:**

- **Complexity of Approval Paths**: Multiple approval pathways and the involvement of various roles might indicate over-complexity, potentially leading to inefficiencies.
- **Rejection and Resubmission Loops**: High frequencies of rejection-resubmission cycles suggest areas for improvement in the initial submission process (e.g., clearer guidelines, more intuitive forms).
- **Performance Variance**: Significant differences in performance (processing time) across variants could indicate bottlenecks or inefficiencies within specific approval stages or roles.
- **Termination Points**: Some declarations terminate without reaching payment handling. Analyzing these terminations could reveal opportunities for process enhancements.

**Recommendations for Further Analysis:**

1. **Detailed Role-Based Analysis**: Examine the workload, approval rates, and processing times for each role to identify bottlenecks.
2. **Root Cause Analysis of Rejections**: Understand the primary reasons for rejections at each stage to inform improvements in the declaration submission process.
3. **Process Simplification Workshop**: Gather stakeholders to discuss streamlining approval pathways while ensuring compliance with organizational requirements.
4. **Employee Feedback Mechanism**: Establish a feedback loop to understand employee pain points in the declaration and payment process, guiding user-centric improvements.
