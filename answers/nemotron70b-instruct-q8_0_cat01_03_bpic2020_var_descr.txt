Based on the provided data, I'll attempt to reconstruct and describe the underlying business process. Please note that some assumptions might be made due to the complexity and potential nuances of the actual process.

**Process Name:** Employee Expense Declaration and Payment Handling

**Involved Roles:**

1. **Employee**: Submits expense declarations.
2. **Pre-Approver**: Reviews declarations before they reach higher-level approvers (might be a team lead or a designated pre-approval role).
3. **Administration**: Likely handles administrative checks (e.g., policy adherence, compliance).
4. **Budget Owner**: Responsible for approving expenses from a budgetary standpoint.
5.. **Supervisor**: Makes final approval decisions on declarations.
6. **Missing** (Assumption: possibly an error or a skipped step in the data; could represent a role or system that sometimes is and sometimes isn't involved).

**The Process:**

1. **Initiation:**
   - **Employee** submits an expense **Declaration**.

2. **Approval Workflow:**
   - The declaration may first go through:
     - **Pre-Approver** for initial review (**Approved** or **Rejected**).
   - If/when approved by Pre-Approver, it then goes to:
     - **Administration** for administrative checks (**Approved** or **Rejected**).
   - Depending on the path (some scenarios bypass certain approval levels), next steps might include:
     - **Budget Owner** for budgetary approval (**Approved** or **Rejected**), especially if financial implications are significant.
   - Ultimately, it reaches the:
     - **Supervisor** for **FINAL_APPROVAL**.

3. **Outcome Handling:**
   - ** Approved by Supervisor (FINAL_APPROVED):**
     - Proceeds to **Request Payment**.
     - Ends with **Payment Handled**, indicating successful reimbursement.
   - **Rejected at Any Point:**
     - Returned to **Employee** as **REJECTED**.
     - Employee may resubmit (**SUBMITTED** again), potentially after addressing rejection reasons.

**Observations and Assumptions:**

- The involvement of **Budget Owner** seems inconsistent across paths, suggesting either flexibility in the approval chain based on declaration specifics (e.g., amount thresholds) or data collection discrepancies.
- **Missing** appears in one path; its meaning is unclear but could indicate a skipped step, an error in tracking, or an optional automated/systematic check not always captured.
- The high frequency and performance metrics associated with direct rejections by **Administration** or **Supervisor** without prior approvals suggest strict controls or possibly a preliminary filtering process.
- **Performance** metrics (e.g., 9110508.000) are likely indicative of processing times, costs, or efficiency measures but lack clear context.

**Recommendations for Process Improvement:**

1. **Standardize Approval Paths:** Clarify and consistently apply approval chains based on declaration types or financial thresholds to reduce complexity.
2. **Enhance Rejection Feedback Loop:** Ensure clear, actionable feedback is provided to employees upon rejection to streamline resubmission processes.
3. **Investigate 'Missing' Step:** Determine the cause of 'Missing' appearances in the process to either correct data collection errors or optimize the identified step.
4. **Analyze High-Rejection Points:** Focus on reducing frequent rejections by Administration or Supervisor through additional pre-approval checks or educating employees/submitters upfront.
