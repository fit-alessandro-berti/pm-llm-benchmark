# Temporal Profile for High-Tech Electronics Supply Chain

Below is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process. The values represent realistic average times (in seconds) and standard deviations between activity pairs throughout the manufacturing process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct sequential pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (345600, 129600),        # ~4 days ± 1.5 days
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1814400, 432000),       # ~3 weeks ± 5 days
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200),          # ~1 day ± 12 hours
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 86400),         # ~2 days ± 1 day
    ('CA', 'PT'): (172800, 86400),         # ~2 days ± 1 day
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 21600),          # ~12 hours ± 6 hours
    ('PK', 'WS'): (14400, 7200),           # ~4 hours ± 2 hours
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),         # ~3 days ± 1 day
    ('DT', 'AS'): (1209600, 432000),       # ~14 days ± 5 days
    
    # Early process non-adjacent pairs
    ('SS', 'RC'): (2160000, 604800),       # ~25 days ± 7 days
    ('SS', 'PT'): (2592000, 691200),       # ~30 days ± 8 days
    ('OP', 'QI'): (1900800, 432000),       # ~22 days ± 5 days
    ('OP', 'CA'): (2073600, 518400),       # ~24 days ± 6 days
    
    # Mid-process non-adjacent pairs
    ('RC', 'CA'): (259200, 86400),         # ~3 days ± 1 day
    ('RC', 'PT'): (432000, 172800),        # ~5 days ± 2 days
    ('QI', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),         # ~3 days ± 1 day
    ('QI', 'PK'): (432000, 129600),        # ~5 days ± 1.5 days
    ('CA', 'WS'): (259200, 86400),         # ~3 days ± 1 day
    
    # Late process non-adjacent pairs
    ('PT', 'DT'): (345600, 129600),        # ~4 days ± 1.5 days
    ('PK', 'DT'): (276480, 86400),         # ~3.2 days ± 1 day
    
    # Long-range pairs (spanning multiple process stages)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (3024000, 777600),       # ~35 days ± 9 days
    ('SS', 'AS'): (3888000, 1036800),      # ~45 days ± 12 days
    ('OP', 'DT'): (2592000, 604800),       # ~30 days ± 7 days
    ('OP', 'AS'): (3628800, 864000),       # ~42 days ± 10 days
    ('RC', 'AS'): (2764800, 691200),       # ~32 days ± 8 days
    ('CA', 'AS'): (2332800, 604800)        # ~27 days ± 7 days

This temporal profile captures both adjacent activities in the process flow and activities separated by multiple steps. The time estimates reflect the realities of global supply chains, including:

- Longer lead times for early procurement stages
- Shorter durations for inspection and assembly operations
- Very short transitions between late-stage activities like packaging and warehousing
- Substantial time intervals for activities that span the entire process
- Higher variability (standard deviation) for longer processes and international operations

With this model and a specified ZETA value, process analysts can identify abnormal temporal patterns that might indicate issues in the supply chain, such as delays in component delivery, quality problems, or logistics inefficiencies.
