The user gave a draft prompt for a benchmark. They want a DuckDB SQL query that filters out cases with more than six events, returning events from cases with six or fewer events. So we need to produce a query. Possibly using a CTE to compute counts per case, then filter. Provide final answer with query. Also maybe explain. Use proper formatting. Ensure code block with sql.

Here’s a concise DuckDB query that does exactly what you described.  
It first computes the event count per `case_id`, keeps only those with a count ≤ 6, and then returns all rows belonging to those cases.

```sql
-- Return events only from cases that have at most 6 events
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*)      AS event_cnt
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)

SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log AS el
JOIN
    case_counts AS cc
    ON el.case_id = cc.case_id
WHERE
    cc.event_cnt <= 6
ORDER BY
    el.case_id,
    el.timestamp;
```

**Explanation**

1. **`case_counts` CTE** – aggregates the `event_log` table to obtain the number of events (`event_cnt`) for each `case_id`.
2. **Join back** – the original `event_log` rows (`el`) are joined to `case_counts` on `case_id`.
3. **Filter** – the `WHERE` clause keeps only those cases where `event_cnt` is ≤ 6.
4. **Ordering** (optional) – sorts the result by `case_id` and `timestamp` for easier inspection.

The result contains the full set of events for every case whose total event count does not exceed six, while all cases with more than six events are excluded.
