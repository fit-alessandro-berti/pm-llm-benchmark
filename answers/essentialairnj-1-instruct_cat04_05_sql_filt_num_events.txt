```python
import duckdb

# Connect to a DuckDB database
con = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')

# Running the provided SQL query
sql_query = """
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
"""

# Execute the query and fetch the results
result = con.execute(sql_query).fetchall()

# Print the results
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

Note: The code snippet above assumes the existence of a DuckDB database connection, with a table named `event_log` as described. If you wish to run this code directly, ensure you have the necessary database connection in place. The query filters out cases with more than six events and orders the remaining results by `case_id` and `timestamp` for better readability.
