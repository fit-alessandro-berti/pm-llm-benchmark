## 20 Open-Ended Questions about the Smartphone Supply Chain Process:

1. Why was a 24/7 operation chosen for smartphone assembly? What are the trade-offs considered regarding cost, labor, and potential for errors?
2. What criteria are used to define "high-demand markets" for air freight versus "other markets" for cargo ship transport? How often is this categorization reviewed?
3. What specific regulatory compliance challenges are anticipated in different regional distribution centers (Europe, North America, Asia, LatAm)?
4. How is the decision made to "Rework or Scrap" a smartphone that fails quality checks? What are the cost implications of each option?
5. What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure the effectiveness of the component sourcing strategy (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany & USA)?
6. How are potential geopolitical risks in component sourcing regions (e.g., Taiwan) mitigated?
7. What communication protocols are in place to ensure seamless information flow between the assembly plant in Malaysia and component suppliers?
8. How is the accuracy of sales forecasts assessed, and what impact does forecast inaccuracy have on the entire supply chain?
9. What is the process for identifying and onboarding new component suppliers, and what due diligence is performed?
10. How are potential disruptions to air freight or cargo shipping (e.g., port congestion, weather events) addressed?
11. What level of inventory is maintained at regional distribution centers, and how is this balance between cost and responsiveness determined?
12. How are retailers and e-commerce fulfillment partners selected and managed? What service level agreements (SLAs) are in place?
13. What data is collected and analyzed to understand customer preferences and inform future smartphone designs (linking back to Market Research)?
14. How is the process for handling VIP/Pre-Order direct shipments differentiated from standard distribution channels?
15. What are the ethical considerations related to sourcing components from different countries, particularly regarding labor practices and environmental impact?
16. How is the performance of the assembly plant in Malaysia monitored, and what measures are taken to improve efficiency and quality?
17. What is the process for handling product returns and warranty claims across different regions?
18. How are changes in component costs factored into pricing decisions and profit margins?
19. What role does technology (e.g., blockchain, AI) play, or could play, in improving transparency and efficiency within this supply chain?
20. How is stakeholder feedback (suppliers, retailers, customers) incorporated into continuous improvement efforts for the smartphone supply chain?
