Here's an analysis of the P2P process anomalies:

*   **Case 
1002**
    *   **Anomaly**:
    *   **Anomaly**:  
    *   **Problematic**: This is a clear example of a case where the steps are out of order. Payment before receiving goods can cause issues.
    *   **Explanation**: It would be considered irregular because it is against the standard practice. A purchase requisition is created and approved after the issue of a Purchase Order.
*   **Case 
1003**
    *   **Anomaly**: The Payment is before invoice received.
    *   **Explanation**:
    *   **Problematic**: It is considered an unusual practice in P2P as it typically has the following order:
        *   Creating a Purchase Requisition
        *   Request approval from the right authority
        *   Issue Purchase Order       
        *   Receive Goods
        *   Match Invoice to PO
        *   Release Payment
        *   Close Case.

*   **Case 1004**:
    *   **Anomaly**:
    *   **Explanation**:
    *   **Problematic**: It is against the standard practice to issue a purchase order and release payment before goods are received.
    *   **Problematic**: This may indicate a potential accounting issue, leading to a failure to adhere to accounting principles.

**Anomalies Identified:**

**Case 1002**

**Description of the Anomaly**:
*   The most concerning anomaly observed in this case is that the payment was released before receiving the goods.  A typical P2P process involves the receipt of goods prior to the invoice.
*   Anomalies identified in the following case are:
    *   Approve Purchase Requisition before the issue of a Purchase Order.
    *   Pay the vendor before goods are received.
    *   There's a sequence where the order of activities is out of order.

**Potential Problems**:

*   **Incorrect Financial Records**:  If payment is made before receiving the goods, there is a risk of paying for goods that were not actually received, leading to potential financial loss.
*   **Fraudulent Activity**: This could also signify a fraud attempt, like paying for goods that don't exist.
*   **Poor Financial Reporting**:  This could indicate a failure to comply with accounting principles.
*   **Inventory Management Issues**: Potential that the accounting team is not aware of the good being received.
*   **Inefficient Process**:  Incorrect sequencing slows down the process, which might create delays.

**Case 1003**

**Description of the Anomaly**:

*   A payment was released prior to the receipt of the vendor invoice.
*   The order of event is the following:
    *   Create Purchase Requisition
    *   Approve Purchase Requisition
    *   Issue Purchase Order
    *   Release Payment
    *   Vendor Invoice Received
    *   Receive Goods
    *   Match Invoice to PO
    *   Close Case
*   This can be a major problem. 

**Potential Problems**:

*   **Incorrect Financial Records**: Payments issued before a vendor invoice are received do not comply with proper accounting controls. This may result in recording of wrong transactions.
*   **Fraudulent Activity**: Payments may be issued before a vendor is correctly vetted, introducing an opportunity for fraud.
*   **Poor Financial Reporting**:  Incorrect reporting could have serious implications.
*   **Incorrect Inventory Records**: The organization might pay for the good but they may not be able to reconcile the inventory, leading to a lack of record and/or loss.
*   **Inadequate Internal Controls**: The situation demonstrates weak internal controls over vendor payments.

**Case 1004**

**Description of the Anomaly**:

*   A payment was released prior to the receipt of the vendor invoice.
*   The order of event is the following:
    *   Create Purchase Requisition
    *   Approve Purchase Requisition
    *   Receive Goods
    *   Issue Purchase Order
    *   Vendor Invoice Received
    *   Match Invoice to PO
    *   Release Payment
    *   Close Case
*   This can be a major problem.
**Potential Problems**:

*   **Incorrect Financial Records**: Payments issued before a vendor invoice are received do not comply with proper accounting controls. This may result in recording of wrong transactions.
*   **Fraudulent Activity**: Payments may be issued before a vendor is correctly vetted, introducing an opportunity for fraud.
*   **Poor Financial Reporting**:  Incorrect reporting could have serious implications.
*   **Incorrect Inventory Records**: The organization might pay for the good but they may not be able to reconcile the inventory, leading to a lack of record and/or loss.
*   **Inadequate Internal Controls**: The situation demonstrates weak internal controls over vendor payments.

**Conclusion**
The anomalies identified in this P2P process, particularly those relating to early payments and incorrect sequencing, are indicative of potential process weaknesses that should be reviewed for correction. This can include:

*   **Process improvements**
*   **Training**
*   **Better controls**
*   **Systematic analysis**
*   **Automation**
