Inferred Activities and How They Were Deduced
------------------------------------------------
(“Evt” = event number)

1. Machine Idle / Stand-by  
   • Evts: 1-3&13-15  
   • Evidence  
     – Near-ambient temperature (20-21 °C)  
     – Atmospheric pressure (1 bar)  
     – Zero vibration, zero material flow, almost no tool movement  
     – Only background energy (0.4-0.5 kWh) typical of electronics that stay on while the machine waits for a job.

2. Cutting Metal  
   • Evts: 4-6  
   • Evidence  
     – Sharp rise in temperature (50  58 °C) produced by friction of a cutter.  
     – Vibration jumps to 30-38 Hz — characteristic of cutting heads/spindles.  
     – Continuous material flow of 5 units/s (chips being evacuated or coolant flow).  
     – Tool position moves steadily from 0 mm to 10 mm, indicating penetration into the work-piece.  
     – Energy consumption surges to 2-3 kWh, matching the high power draw of cutting motors.

3. Assembling Parts  
   • Evts: 7-8  
   • Evidence  
     – Temperature drops to a stable 40 °C; cutters are no longer active.  
     – Vibration collapses to 10 Hz, but pressure climbs to 2 bar – typical for pneumatic clamps or presses used while fitting parts together.  
     – Lower but non-zero flow (2 units/s) could be grease or fastening material.  
     – Tool holds around 15 mm (parts being brought together rather than cut).  
     – Energy is moderate (2 kWh).

4. Welding  
   • Evt: 9  
   • Evidence  
     – Temperature spikes to 80 °C and energy leaps to 5 kWh – the classic thermal and electrical load of a welding arc.  
     – Vibration increases to 50 Hz as the welding head oscillates/pulses.  
     – Material flow drops to 0 units/s (filler wire feed is usually not monitored by this flow sensor).  
     – Pressure remains at 2 bar (shielding gas or clamp still engaged).

5. Quality Inspection  
   • Evt: 10  
   • Evidence  
     – Machine cools rapidly (30 °C) and vibration is almost nil (1 Hz).  
     – No material flow.  
     – Energy falls to 1 kWh, enough for vision systems or probing devices.  
     – Tool position unchanged (15 mm) while sensors “look” at the welded joint.

6. Packaging / Off-loading  
   • Evts: 11-12  
   • Evidence  
     – Stable low temperature (25 °C) and modest vibration (5 Hz) while the part is moved to a packaging chute.  
     – Light material flow (1 unit/s) suggests wrapping/label feed.  
     – Tool retracts a bit farther (to 20 mm), indicating transfer to an output position.  
     – Slightly higher energy than inspection (1.6 kWh) caused by conveyors or actuators.

Using only numerical sensor patterns, we have partitioned the raw log into six intuitive, high-level manufacturing activities and provided a physical rationale for every assignment.
