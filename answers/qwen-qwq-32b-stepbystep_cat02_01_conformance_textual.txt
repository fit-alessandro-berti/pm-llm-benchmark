Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out which cases in the event log deviate from the normative process described. Let me first make sure I understand the normative process thoroughly before looking at the logs.

The normative process has two main paths: one where inventory is sufficient and another where it's insufficient. Let me outline the correct sequences first.

For sufficient inventory:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Package items
5. Ship order
6. Close order

For insufficient inventory:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Cancel order
4. Close order

Key constraints from the description:
- Check inventory must come right after Receive order.
- "Authorize payment" must happen after checking inventory but before packaging.
- Packaging must come before shipping.
- If inventory is insufficient, after Cancel, you can't have any fulfillment steps (like package or ship).
- Close order is always the last step.

Now, let me go through each case one by one.

**Case 1:**
Activities in order:
Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Package -> Ship -> Close
This matches the sufficient inventory path exactly. So no violations here.

**Case 2:**
Sequence:
Receive -> Check -> Package -> Authorize -> Ship -> Close
Wait, here after Check inventory, they go to Package before Authorize payment. The norm requires that Authorize must come before Packaging. So this is a problem. The payment authorization is after packaging which violates the rule that authorization must happen before packaging. So this case is violating the order between Authorize and Package.

**Case 3:**
Activities:
Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Cancel -> Ship -> Close
Hmm. After Cancel order, they proceed to Ship order, which is a fulfillment step. The norm says that after cancellation, you can't have package or ship. So shipping after cancellation is a violation. Also, the Cancel is after Authorize payment. Wait, but if inventory was insufficient, then after Check inventory, you should go straight to Cancel. But here, they did Authorize payment before Cancel? That's impossible because if inventory is insufficient, you shouldn't authorize payment. So this case has two issues:
1. They authorized payment before determining inventory was sufficient (but since they ended up canceling, that's a problem because authorization shouldn't happen if inventory is insufficient).
2. After Cancel, they still shipped, which isn't allowed.

Wait, but according to the norm, if inventory is insufficient, after checking, you must Cancel immediately. So the presence of Authorize payment here suggests that they first thought inventory was sufficient, but then later canceled, which contradicts the process. Because once inventory is checked, if it's insufficient, you must cancel right away. So Authorize payment shouldn't happen in that path. Therefore, this case is definitely violating multiple steps.

**Case 4:**
Sequence:
Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close
That's exactly the insufficient inventory path. So this is okay. No violations here.

**Case 5:**
Activities:
Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Ship -> Close
Wait, after Authorize, they go to Ship without Packaging. The norm requires that after Authorize, you must Package items before shipping. So skipping the packaging step between Authorize and Ship is a violation. Also, the order of events here is missing the package step between authorize and ship. So that's a problem. Additionally, the Close is after ship, which is okay, but the missing package step is an issue.

Wait, the norm says: after payment is authorized, the items should be packaged, then shipped. So between authorize and ship, there must be package. Here, it skips package, so that's a violation.

Now, let me check if I missed anything else in the cases.

Case 3 also has Close after Ship, but after Cancel. The norm says after Cancel, Close is next. But they did Ship after Cancel, which is a violation. Also, in Case 3, the Cancel comes after Authorize, which shouldn't happen because once you check inventory and it's insufficient, you can't authorize payment. The Authorize step in that case is invalid because they must have checked inventory and found insufficient, so Authorize should never happen. So that's another violation: Authorize after Cancel isn't allowed because Cancel should be the next step after Check when inventory is low, and then you can't do any other steps except Close.

Wait, actually, in Case 3's log, the order after Check is Authorize, then Cancel. That suggests that the inventory check was sufficient, leading to authorize, then for some reason they canceled later. But according to the process, once you check inventory, if it's insufficient, you must immediately cancel, so the Authorize can only occur if inventory was sufficient. If later they had to cancel, that might mean the inventory was sufficient but then something changed? But according to the process description, the inventory check determines the path. There's no mention of a scenario where after authorizing, you can cancel. So the path in Case3 is invalid because after Check, they went to Authorize, implying inventory was sufficient, but then later Cancel. That's not allowed. The process should branch at Check: either proceed with the full path (authorize, package, etc.) or cancel immediately. So doing Cancel after Authorize is a violation because once you proceed to authorize, you can't go back to cancel. Or perhaps the inventory check was done, found sufficient, but then later realized it's not? The norm doesn't mention that possibility. The process expects that the inventory check is definitive. So the sequence in Case3 is wrong in multiple ways.

Now let me list the violations case by case.

Case 2:
- Package comes before Authorize. That's a violation because Authorize must come before Package.

Case3:
- Authorize before Cancel is not allowed. Because if inventory was insufficient, they shouldn't have authorized. Moreover, after Cancel, they shipped, which is a no-no. Also, the order after Cancel shouldn't have any steps except closing. So multiple violations here.

Case5:
- Missing the Package step between Authorize and Ship. So Ship comes right after Authorize, skipping Package. That's a violation.

Case4 is okay.

Now, let me check each case again to ensure I didn't miss anything.

Case1: All steps are in order. Correct.

Case2: The problem is the order of Authorize and Package being reversed. The norm says Authorize must come after Check and before Package.

Case3: Several issues:
1. Authorize comes before Cancel. That implies that the inventory was sufficient (since they authorized), but then they canceled, which isn't allowed. If inventory was insufficient, they can't authorize.
2. They shipped after cancellation, which is a direct violation.
3. The sequence after Cancel shouldn't have any steps except Close. So Ship is invalid.

Case5: Skipped the package step between Authorize and Ship. The correct path requires Package after Authorize and before Ship. So that's a violation.

Wait, in Case5, after Authorize, the next step is Ship. So missing the Package. So yes, that's a problem.

Now, let me check if there are other possible issues. For Case3, the order after Check is Authorize, then Cancel. That suggests that after checking, they first authorized payment (which requires inventory sufficient), but then later canceled. That's impossible under the process rules. The process path is fixed once the inventory is checked: if insufficient, Cancel next; else, proceed. So if they did Authorize, that implies inventory was sufficient, but then they later canceled, which isn't allowed. The process doesn't allow going back to Cancel after proceeding. So that path is invalid.

Another point: the norm says "Cancel order must be directly after Check inventory when insufficient. So in Case3, after Check, they went through Authorize, which only happens if inventory was sufficient, but then later canceled, which is not allowed. So the Authorize step here is a violation because if inventory was insufficient, they shouldn't have done that. The presence of Cancel indicates that inventory was insufficient, but they proceeded to authorize, which is wrong.

Case2's problem is the order of Authorize and Package reversed.

Case5: Missing Package between Authorize and Ship.

Now, let me check if there are any other violations:

Case3 also has Ship after Cancel, which is a direct violation because after Cancel, you can't do any steps except Close.

Case5: The order is Authorize -> Ship. Since they skipped Package, the Ship is done without packaging. So that's wrong.

Now, let's see if any other cases have issues.

Case4 is okay. Case1 is okay.

So the violating cases are 2,3,5.

Now, let me detail each case's violations as per the norm's rules.

Case2:
Violation 1: "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment". The norm requires Authorize must come before Package.

Case3:
Violation 1: "Authorize payment" occurred before "Cancel order". Since the presence of Cancel implies insufficient inventory, Authorize shouldn't have happened because authorization is only for sufficient inventory. Hence, Authorize before Cancel is impossible and invalid.

Violation 2: "Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order". After cancellation, no fulfillment steps allowed, so shipping is invalid.

Case5:
Violation 1: "Ship order" occurred without "Package items" in between. The norm requires Package before Ship. So the sequence Authorize -> Ship skips that step.

Now, I need to make sure there are no other violations. Let me check timestamps again for each case.

Case3's activities after Check inventory:
At 09:40, they authorized payment. Then at 10:00 canceled, then shipped. So the sequence is:

After Check, they first authorized, then canceled. That's out of order. The correct path after Check would be: if sufficient, proceed to authorize, etc. If insufficient, immediately Cancel. Here, they did Authorize (so implying sufficient), but later canceled, which is a contradiction. So the process allows for no such path. Hence, the Authorize step here is invalid because they ended up canceling, which is only possible if inventory was insufficient. So the authorizing was done incorrectly.

Additionally, shipping after cancel is another violation.

Case5 has the sequence: after authorize, they ship, skipping package. So that's a violation of the required order.

Now, are there any other possible violations?

Case2 also has a problem with the Close order being last, which it is, so that's okay.

Case3's Close is last, but the steps before are wrong.

Case5's Close is last, so that's okay.

Another check: all cases end with Close, which is good.

Now, let me see if there are any other steps missing or extra steps. For example, in Case3, after Cancel, they have Ship and Close. So Ship is an extra step after Cancel.

So summarizing:

Violating cases: 2,3,5.

Now, the answer needs to list which cases are violating, and explain each violation with reference to the norm.

Let me structure the answer accordingly.
</think>

### Case Analysis and Violations:

**Case 1:**  
No violations. This case follows the **sufficient inventory path** exactly:  
`Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close`  
 **Valid process flow.**

---

**Case 2:**  
**Violation 1:** **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"**, violating the normative rule that "Authorize payment must occur before packaging."  
- Normative requirement: After inventory is confirmed sufficient, payment authorization must precede packaging.  
- Case 2’s sequence: `Check  Package  Authorize` skips the required authorization step *before* packaging.  

**Violation 2:** **Missing "Package items" before "Ship order"**, though this is less severe since packaging is explicitly required between authorization and shipping. However, the primary violation here is the reversed order of Authorize and Package.  

---

**Case 3:**  
**Violation 1:** **"Authorize payment" occurs after "Check inventory" but before "Cancel order"**, which is impossible under the normative process.  
- If inventory is insufficient, the process must immediately transition to **Cancel order** after the inventory check. The authorization of payment implies inventory was deemed sufficient, creating a logical contradiction.  

**Violation 2:** **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"**, which is explicitly prohibited.  
- The norm states that fulfillment steps (e.g., shipping) cannot occur after cancellation.  

**Violation 3:** **Unauthorized "Ship order" activity** post-cancel further violates the requirement that "Close order" is the only step after cancellation.  

---

**Case 4:**  
No violations. Follows the **insufficient inventory path** exactly:  
`Receive  Check  Cancel  Close`  
 **Valid process flow.**

---

**Case 5:**  
**Violation 1:** **"Ship order" occurs without first completing "Package items"**, violating the rule that "items must be packaged before shipping."  
- Normative sequence requires: `Authorize  Package  Ship`. Case 5 skips packaging entirely: `Authorize  Ship`.  

---

### Summary of Violating Cases:  
- **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5** deviate from the normative process.  

### Key Violations Explained:  
1. **Case 2:**  
   - Unauthorized reversal of "Authorize payment" and "Package items."  
   - Breaks the rule: *Payment authorization must precede packaging.*  

2. **Case 3:**  
   - Unauthorized "Authorize payment" before cancellation (violates inventory-check logic).  
   - Unauthorized "Ship order" after cancellation (fulfillment after cancellation is prohibited).  

3. **Case 5:**  
   - Missing "Package items" between authorization and shipping (required by normative process).  

All violations stem from either:  
- Out-of-order steps (e.g., packaging before authorization),  
- Invalid steps post-cancellation (e.g., shipping after cancel),  
- Missing mandatory steps (e.g., skipping packaging before shipping).  

The normative description’s constraints are clear on these points, even allowing for ambiguities about edge cases like "extraordinary circumstances," which are not indicated in the log.
