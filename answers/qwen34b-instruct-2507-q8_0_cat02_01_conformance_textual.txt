Let's carefully analyze each case in the event log against the **normative process description** to determine whether any deviations occur.

---

###  **Key Rules from the Normative Description (Summarized):**

1. **Process must start with "Receive order"**   Always required.
2. **"Check inventory" must occur before any decision about payment or fulfillment**.
   - Payment authorization and packaging **cannot occur before** inventory check.
3. **If inventory is sufficient**:
   - Sequence:  
     `Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package  Ship  Close`
4. **If inventory is insufficient**:
   - Sequence:  
     `Receive  Check  Cancel  Close`
   - **No fulfillment activities (package, ship)** after cancellation.
5. **"Ship order" must not occur after cancellation**.
6. **"Close order" must be the final activity in all cases**   Must appear last.
7. **"Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment"**  because items must be prepared only after payment is authorized.
8. **"Ship order" must occur after "Package items"**  no shipping without packaging.

Now, let's go through each case step by step.

---

###  **Case 1**
| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 09:00 | Receive order |
| 10:00 | Check inventory |
| 11:00 | Authorize payment |
| 12:00 | Package items |
| 13:00 | Ship order |
| 14:00 | Close order |

**Sequence**: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
 All steps follow the correct **inventory-sufficient** path.  
- Inventory check before payment   
- Payment before packaging   
- Packaging before shipping   
- Final step is Close order   

 **No violation**.

---

###  **Case 2**
| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 09:00 | Receive order |
| 09:30 | Check inventory |
| 10:00 | **Package items**   before authorization |
| 10:30 | Authorize payment |
| 11:00 | Ship order |
| 11:30 | Close order |

**Sequence**: Receive  Check  **Package  Authorize  Ship  Close**

Problems:
- **"Package items" occurs BEFORE "Authorize payment"**  violates rule: "Package items should only occur after authorization."
- This implies the order was packaged before payment was confirmed — illogical, as payment must be valid before shipping.
- Even though inventory was checked, packaging without payment authorization is not allowed.

 **Violation**: Packaging before authorization of payment.

 **Violation Type**: Unauthorized packaging before payment.

 Final close step is present  OK.

 **Violation detected**   **Case 2 violates the normative process**.

---

###  **Case 3**
| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 09:00 | Receive order |
| 09:20 | Check inventory |
| 09:40 | Authorize payment |
| 10:00 | Cancel order |
| 10:30 | **Ship order**   after cancellation |
| 11:00 | Close order |

**Sequence**: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close

Problems:
- **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"**  violates rule: "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation."
- Cancellation implies fulfillment is not happening; shipping after cancellation is illogical.

 **Violation**: Shipping after cancellation.

 **Violation Type**: Fulfillment activity (shipping) after cancellation.

 Close order is last  OK.

 **Violation detected**   **Case 3 violates the normative process**.

---

###  **Case 4**
| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 09:00 | Receive order |
| 09:10 | Check inventory |
| 09:20 | Cancel order |
| 09:50 | Close order |

**Sequence**: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close

- All steps in the **cancellation path**.
- Inventory check before cancellation 
- No fulfillment activities (no package, no ship)  
- Close order is last 

 **No violation**.

---

###  **Case 5**
| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 09:00 | Receive order |
| 10:00 | Check inventory |
| 10:30 | Authorize payment |
| 11:00 | Ship order |
| 11:30 | Close order |

**Sequence**: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close

**Issues?**
- Missing "Package items" step.
- But the normative description says: **"Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment — Package items"**  so packaging is required **before** shipping.

 Therefore, **"Package items" must occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order"**.

In this case:
- Authorization  Ship  no packaging  missing intermediate step.

This is a **critical gap**.

The process implies that **after payment is authorized**, the items must be **prepared (packaged)** before being shipped.

Thus, **shipping without packaging** is a violation.

 **Violation**: Shipping occurs **before packaging**, which violates the rule:  
> "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping."

 **Violation Type**: Shipping without packaging.

 Close order is last  OK.

 **Violation detected**   **Case 5 violates the normative process**.

###  Summary of Violations:

| Case | Violation(s) | Reason |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **1** |  No violation | Correct inventory-sufficient flow |
| **2** |  Packaging before payment authorization | Violates: "Package items should only occur after authorization" |
| **3** |  Shipping after cancellation | Violates: "Ship order should never occur after cancellation" |
| **4** |  No violation | Correct cancellation path |
| **5** |  Shipping without packaging | Violates: "Package items must occur before shipping" |

---

###  Final Answer:

---

### **1. Cases that violate the normative process:**

 **Case 2**, **Case 3**, and **Case 5**

---

### **2. Explanation of Violations:**

- **Case 2**:  
  The "Package items" activity occurs **before** "Authorize payment", which violates the rule that payment must be authorized **before** packaging. This suggests the order was fulfilled before payment validation, which is not logically sound.

- **Case 3**:  
  The "Ship order" activity occurs **after** "Cancel order", which violates the rule that once an order is canceled, no fulfillment steps (like shipping) should take place. Shipping after cancellation is contradictory and illogical.

- **Case 5**:  
  The "Ship order" activity occurs **without** the intervening "Package items" step. The normative process requires that items be packaged after payment authorization and before shipping. The absence of packaging makes this sequence invalid.

---

###  Interpretation Notes:
- The normative description does **not** allow skipping the packaging step — it is a mandatory step between payment and shipping.
- The cancellation path is strictly defined: after cancellation, no fulfillment activities should occur.
- The order must be checked before any further action — no exceptions are implied.

Thus, despite some cases having plausible business reasons, **all violations are direct contradictions** of the stated rules and must be flagged.

---

###  Final Output:

**Cases that violate the normative process: Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5.**

**Reasons for violations:**
- **Case 2**: Packaging occurs before payment authorization.
- **Case 3**: Shipping occurs after cancellation.
- **Case 5**: Shipping occurs without prior packaging.  

These deviations violate core logical and procedural constraints outlined in the normative process.
