This is a business process diagram showing the workflow for shipping goods, divided into three swim lanes: Logistics, Secretary, and Warehouse. The process begins with "Ship goods" and follows several parallel paths:

1. In the Secretary lane:
- Starts with clarifying shipment method
- Branches based on whether special handling is needed
- Includes steps for checking insurance requirements, getting logistics offers, and writing package labels
- Shows interaction with customer information and order details

2. In the Logistics lane:
- Contains a single task for insuring parcels when necessary

3. In the Warehouse lane:
- Involves packaging goods (with a 48-hour timer)
- Includes customer notification about delays if needed
- Ends with filling out shipment paperwork and moving packages to pickup area

The process concludes with "Shipment prepared" status. The diagram uses standard BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) symbols, including gateways, tasks, and parallel process flows. Arrows connect the various steps, showing the sequence and relationships between different activities across departments.
