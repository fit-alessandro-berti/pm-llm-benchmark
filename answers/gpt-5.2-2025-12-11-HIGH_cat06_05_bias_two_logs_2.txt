**Group B exhibits bias** (the unprotected group log), because it applies a systematic, non–job-performance-based advantage to a subset of candidates via **“+5 (Association Boost)”** tied to membership in **LocalBusinessLeadersClub**. Group A shows no such differential adjustment rule.

## How the bias manifests
1. **Different scoring rules for different candidates**
   - In **Group B**, candidates with the association (U001, U003) receive a **+5 increase to CulturalFit**, while candidates without it (U002) do not.
   - In **Group A**, no candidate receives any analogous boost; **ScoreAdjustment = 0** throughout.

2. **The boost can change (or secure) outcomes**
   - **U001**: CulturalFit 60  **65 after +5**, then **Hired**.
   - **U003**: CulturalFit 58  **63 after +5**, then **Hired**.
   - This creates a pathway where candidates with *lower unadjusted cultural fit* can end up comparable to—or better than—those without the affiliation, potentially affecting hiring decisions at thresholds or in close comparisons.

3. **Proxy/structural advantage**
   - Professional association membership often correlates with **local residency, socioeconomic status, networking access, and demographic composition**. Even if the boost is not explicitly based on protected characteristics, it can function as a **proxy** that disproportionately benefits already-advantaged groups.

## Fairness and equity implications
- **Procedural unfairness:** Applicants are not evaluated under the same criteria; the process violates “equal treatment” norms because the model/analyst applies an extra benefit unrelated to measured skills or assessments.
- **Disparate impact risk:** If protected groups are less likely to have access to or membership in the LocalBusinessLeadersClub, the rule can systematically lower their hiring rates compared to the unprotected group, even when qualifications are similar.
- **Legitimacy and job-relatedness concerns:** “Cultural fit” is already a subjective and bias-prone construct; explicitly boosting it for a social affiliation increases the risk of reinforcing homogeneity (“people like us”) rather than selecting on job-relevant competencies.
- **Downstream inequity:** Preferential boosts compound over time—more hires from the favored network lead to more referrals, more representation, and further entrenchment of advantage.

**Bottom line:** Group B’s log shows bias because it embeds a preferential rule (“association boost”) that can materially influence hiring outcomes and is likely to privilege certain social groups, undermining fairness and equity. Group A is comparatively more equitable because it applies no such differential adjustment.
