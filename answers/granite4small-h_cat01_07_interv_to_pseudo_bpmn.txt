Below is a **BPMNlike textual model** that captures the invoiceapproval workflow described in the interview excerpts.  The notation uses familiar BPMN symbols (Task, Gateway, Subprocess, etc.) written as indented blocks so you can copypaste it directly into most diagramming tools or convert it manually to a visual BPMN chart.

## Process Overview  

```
Process: Invoice Approval

[Start]  ReceiveInvoice  CheckPO  
     (if PO missing)  AskSupplierForPO  BackToReceiveInvoice
CheckPO  LogInvoice  ForwardToPurchasing  ConfirmReceipt  
ConfirmReceipt  MatchInvoiceToPO  ResolveDifferences  

ResolveDifferences: (multiple parallel paths)
     No discrepancy  ApprovalByManager
     Discrepancy detected  
          Simple issue  EmailPurchasingForClarification
                         BackToMatchInvoiceToPO
          Complex/escalated issue  EscalateToSupervisor  
                                             ResolveException (subprocess)
ResolveDifferences  ApprovalByManager  

ApprovalByManager  SchedulePayment  [End]

## Detailed Element List  

| Symbol | Identifier | Description / Role |
|--------|------------|--------------------|
| **Start Event** | `ReceiveInvoice` | Invoice arrives (email) – *Accountant* (Mary). |
| **Task** | `CheckPO` | Verify invoice contains a valid PO number. If not, loop back to request details from supplier (*Mary*). |
| **Task** | `LogInvoice` | Enter invoice into the accounting system. |
| **Task** | `ForwardToPurchasing` | Send invoice for receipt confirmation. |
| **Task** | `ConfirmReceipt` | Purchasing officer (Dan) checks that goods/services were received and matches PO details; sends confirmation back to AP (*Dan*). |
| **Exclusive Gateway** | `MatchInvoiceToPO` | Decision: *Do the lineitems match PO?* |
| **Parallel Tasks / Subprocesses** | `ResolveDifferences` (branch) | Handles discrepancies. <br>• Simple issue  EmailPurchasingForClarification.<br>• Complex/unclear  EscalateToSupervisor. |
| **Task** | `EmailPurchasingForClarification` | AP clerk (Mary) asks purchasing for clarification; loops back to match step after response (*Mary*). |
| **Event** | `EscalationTrigger` | Used when issue cannot be resolved quickly – escalates to supervisor (**Rita**, Accounts Payable Supervisor). |
| **Subprocess** | `ResolveException` (internal) | <br>• Contact supplier, request corrected PO/information.<br>• If still unresolved  create retrospective PO or reject invoice. <br>*Supervisor* and *Supplier Relationship Manager* (Karen) may be consulted here. |
| **Task** | `ApprovalByManager` | Department manager signs off after all issues resolved (*Carlos*). |
| **Task** | `SchedulePayment` | Accounts Payable schedules the invoice for payment run; final step before invoice is paid (*Rita*). |
| **End Event** | `[End]` | Invoice fully approved and ready for payment. |

---

## Roles / Participants  

- **Accountant (Mary – Accounts Payable Clerk)**  
  - Receives invoices, logs them, checks PO, forwards to purchasing, handles clarifications, escalates when needed.

- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**  
  - Confirms receipt of goods/services against the invoice; validates PO reference before forwarding back for matching. Provides confirmation after match step.

- **Department Manager (Carlos)**  
  - Receives final matched and confirmed invoices; approves or rejects based on budgeting/quality checks (*Carlos*).

- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**  
  - Handles exceptions that cannot be resolved at the clerk level, contacts suppliers, creates retrospective POs, ensures problem invoices move out of exception state.

- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen – optional liaison)**  
  - Communicates with external suppliers to resolve discrepancies in terms or pricing; provides contract information when needed.

## Artifacts / Data Objects  

| Artifact | Source/Owner |
|----------|--------------|
| Invoice Document | Supplier  AP Clerk |
| Purchase Order (PO) Record | Purchasing Dept. |
| LineItem Matching Report | System generated after matching step |
| Confirmation Email | Purchasing Officer to AP Clerk |
| Manager Approval Flag | Manager’s decision entry in system |

---

## Exceptions / Variations  

1. **Missing PO Number** – *AskSupplierForPO* loop; creates a rework branch before `ConfirmReceipt`.  
2. **Discrepancy Found (simple)** – EmailPurchasingForClarification  back to matching after response.  
3. **Discrepancy Found (complex / unresolved)** – EscalationTrigger leads into *ResolveException* subprocess; may involve: <br>• Supplier contact (Karen) <br>• Creation of retrospective PO (Rita) <br>• Manager reapproval after resolution.  
4. **Rejected Invoice** – If manager or supervisor rejects, the invoice is sent back to *AskSupplierForPO* with a note explaining rejection; this forms an alternate path that does not end in payment scheduling.

## Process Flow Summary (Textual)

```
1 ReceiveInvoice  CheckPO
2   If PO missing  AskSupplierForPO  return to 1  
3 LogInvoice  ForwardToPurchasing  ConfirmReceipt (Dan)
4 MatchInvoiceToPO
5    No discrepancy  ApprovalByManager
6    Discrepancy  
7       If simple  EmailPurchasingForClarification  back to 4  
8       Else complex  EscalateToSupervisor  ResolveException (subprocess)  back to 5 or forward after fix
9 ApprovalByManager  SchedulePayment  End
```

### How to Convert This Textual Model to BPMN Diagram  

1. **Create a new process** named *Invoice Approval*.  
2. Add the listed events, tasks, gateways, and subprocesses in that order (use exclusive gateway for decision points).  
3. Connect each element with sequence flows according to the arrows shown above; label diverging flows as “PO missing”, “Discrepancy? Yes/No”, etc., matching the conditions described by interviewees.  
4. Assign **roles** or **lanes** (e.g., *Accounts Payable*, *Purchasing*, *Management*) for each activity to visualize responsibility.  
5. For exception handling, nest a subprocess inside `ResolveException` and add its internal steps as per the “Supervisor” interview.

### Note on Ambiguities  

- The exact trigger wording (“system sends an automatic email”) is not shown; this can be expressed in BPMN via *Message* or *Timer* events if needed.  
- Some interviews imply that after manager approval, payment scheduling occurs automatically (*Rita*). Model this as a sequential flow unless you wish to add an explicit “SchedulePayment” task followed by a **System** message event (e.g., “Payment Run Trigger”).  

Feel free to adjust naming or ordering based on any additional clarification from the business users. This model should give you a solid, interviewgrounded basis for diagramming and further analysis with process mining tools.
