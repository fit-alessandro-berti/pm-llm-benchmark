The visualization is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram representing the workflow of an order process. The diagram depicts a multi-line horizontal structure with sales, production, procurement, and warehouse sections. It portrays the process of an order, from the start to its completion.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

*   **Sales section:** The process starts with the "Monday morning" activity, starting time, it receives an incoming sales request, and proceeds through several steps to see what it takes to deal with the order, checking for completeness.
*   **Production section:** The order details arrive and leads into "Plan production", then the plan proceeds towards the manufacture of the product. If the material is faulty the "Plan production" is started again.
*   **Procurement section:**  This section focuses on materials, the order process, and the process for the materials. It also depicts the possibility of returning materials.
*   **Warehouse Section**: This part of the flow is the final step in the sales process where the product will be sent out after it is complete.

The overall process appears to track the flow of a customer order, starting from an incoming order and ending with the delivery of the product. It describes the process a company goes through from a sales perspective.
