This visualization shows a software system design using multiple modeling approaches:

## Part (a): Proclet Classes and Communication
The main diagram depicts two "proclet classes" (Lab visit and Lab test) connected through communication channels. Key elements include:

- **Lab visit proclet**: Shows a workflow starting with order entry, blood sample collection, receiving results, judging results, and either finishing or doing tests again
- **Lab test proclet**: Handles performing tests, making reports, and managing chemical analysis
- **Communication channels**: Dotted lines with arrows showing message flow between the two proclets
- **Actors**: Including doctor, lab assistant, and chemical analyst
- **Decision points**: Represented by diamond shapes and circular nodes

## Part (b): Class Diagram
A simplified UML-style class diagram showing the relationship between Lab visit and Lab test classes, with a "requires" relationship and 1:1 cardinality.

## Part (c): Performative Example
A tabular specification showing:
- **Time**: 11:00
- **Channel**: Order system  
- **Sender**: Lab visit - John
- **Receivers**: Lab test - HGB John
- **Action**: Create
- **Content**: "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
- **Scope**: Private
- **Direction**: OUT

This appears to be modeling a laboratory testing system where lab visits trigger lab tests through structured communication channels, demonstrating both the process flow and the formal specification of inter-component messages.
