### Analysis of the Event Log

#### Step 1: Identify Cases with Longer Resolution Times

First, let's determine the total resolution time for each case. This is calculated as the difference between the "Close Ticket" timestamp and the "Receive Ticket" timestamp.

| Case ID | Receive Ticket           | Close Ticket              | Total Resolution Time (hours) |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00         | 2024-03-01 10:15          | 2.25                            |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05         | 2024-03-02 09:15          | 25.17                           |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10         | 2024-03-01 09:30          | 1.33                            |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20         | 2024-03-02 08:30          | 24.17                           |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25         | 2024-03-03 09:30          | 49.17                           |

From the table above, it is clear that Cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer total resolution times compared to Cases 101 and 103.

#### Step 2: Determine Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

Let's break down the lifecycle of each case to identify potential bottlenecks:

**Case 101:**
- Receive Ticket: 08:00
- Triage Ticket: 08:10
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 08:20
- Investigate Issue: 09:00
- Resolve Ticket: 10:00
- Close Ticket: 10:15

**Case 102:**
- Receive Ticket: 08:05
- Triage Ticket: 08:30
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:00
- Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 11:30
- Investigate Issue: 14:00
- Resolve Ticket: 09:00 (next day)
- Close Ticket: 09:15 (next day)

**Case 103:**
- Receive Ticket: 08:10
- Triage Ticket: 08:15
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 08:30
- Investigate Issue: 08:45
- Resolve Ticket: 09:15
- Close Ticket: 09:30

**Case 104:**
- Receive Ticket: 08:20
- Triage Ticket: 09:00
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:30
- Investigate Issue: 13:00
- Resolve Ticket: 08:00 (next day)
- Close Ticket: 08:30 (next day)

**Case 105:**
- Receive Ticket: 08:25
- Triage Ticket: 08:35
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:00
- Investigate Issue: 09:10
- Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 10:00
- Investigate Issue: 14:00 (next day)
- Resolve Ticket: 09:00 (two days later)
- Close Ticket: 09:30 (two days later)

**Observations:**
1. **Escalations:** Cases 102 and 105 involved escalations to a Level-2 Agent, which significantly increased the resolution time.
2. **Long Waiting Times:** Cases 102, 104, and 105 had long waiting times between activities, especially after the investigation step.
3. **Delayed Investigation:** Case 104 had a significant delay between assignment to a Level-1 Agent and the investigation step.

#### Step 3: Explain Factors Leading to Increased Cycle Times and Propose Recommendations

**Factors Leading to Increased Cycle Times:**
1. **Escalations:** Escalations to Level-2 Agents introduce additional steps and potential delays, as seen in Cases 102 and 105.
2. **Long Waiting Times:** Significant delays between activities, such as between investigation and resolution, contribute to longer resolution times.
3. **Delayed Investigation:** Delays in starting the investigation phase can also prolong the resolution process.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Streamline Escalation Process:** Improve the efficiency of the escalation process by ensuring faster handoffs and better coordination between Level-1 and Level-2 Agents.
2. **Reduce Waiting Times:** Implement measures to reduce waiting times between activities. This could involve setting time limits for each step and ensuring timely follow-ups.
3. **Optimize Investigation Start:** Ensure that the investigation phase starts promptly after assignment. This could be achieved through better resource allocation and prioritization of tasks.
4. **Training and Resources:** Provide additional training to Level-1 Agents to handle more complex issues, reducing the need for escalations. Ensure adequate resources are available to support agents effectively.

By addressing these factors, the overall efficiency of the "Customer Support Ticket Resolution" process can be improved, leading to shorter resolution times and better customer satisfaction.
