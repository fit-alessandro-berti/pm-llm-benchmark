### BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Workflow

---

#### **Process Overview:**
The **Invoice Approval Process** begins when an invoice is received and ends when the invoice is scheduled for payment. The process involves multiple roles and includes decision points based on the validation of the invoice against purchase orders (POs) and the resolution of discrepancies.

---

### **Process Steps:**

#### **1. Receive Invoice**
- **Activity:** Receive invoice (usually via email).
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
- **Artifact:** Invoice document.

---

#### **2. Validate Purchase Order (PO)**
- **Activity:** Check if the invoice is associated with a valid PO.
- **Decision Point (Gateway):** 
  - **If Invoice has a valid PO:** Proceed to **Log Invoice**.
  - **If Invoice does not have a valid PO:** 
    - **Action:** Send invoice back to the supplier requesting more details.
    - **Exception Path:** Supplier provides missing PO or revised invoice → Return to **Receive Invoice**.
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).

---

#### **3. Log Invoice**
- **Activity:** Log the invoice into the accounting system.
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
- **Artifact:** Logged invoice record in the system.

---

#### **4. Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**
- **Activity:** Forward the invoice to the Purchasing Department to confirm receipt.
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
- **Decision Point (Gateway):** 
  - **If Receipt is confirmed:** Proceed to **Match Invoice to PO**.
  - **If Receipt is not confirmed:** 
    - **Action:** Hold invoice and follow up with supplier or internal teams.
    - **Exception Path:** Resolve receipt issues → Return to **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**.
- **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan).

---

#### **5. Match Invoice to PO**
- **Activity:** Match invoice line items against the PO in the system.
- **Decision Point (Gateway):** 
  - **If Match is successful:** Proceed to **Request Manager Approval**.
  - **If Discrepancy exists:** 
    - **Action:** Email Purchasing Team to clarify.
    - **Decision Point (Gateway):** 
      - **If Discrepancy resolved:** Proceed to **Request Manager Approval**.
      - **If Discrepancy cannot be resolved:** 
        - **Action:** Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).
        - **Exception Path:** 
          - **Resolution Options:** 
            - Contact supplier for corrections.
            - Create retrospective PO (if applicable).
            - Reject invoice.
          - **After Resolution:** Return to **Match Invoice to PO**.
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) and Purchasing Officer (Dan).

---

#### **6. Request Manager Approval**
- **Activity:** System sends automatic email to Department Manager requesting approval.
- **Role:** System (Automated).
- **Artifact:** Approval request email.

---

#### **7. Approve or Reject Invoice**
- **Activity:** Department Manager reviews invoice details, PO, and confirmation.
- **Decision Point (Gateway):** 
  - **If Approval granted:** Proceed to **Schedule Payment**.
  - **If Rejected:** 
    - **Action:** Reject invoice and notify Accounts Payable Clerk.
    - **Exception Path:** 
      - **Resolution Options:** 
        - Investigate further.
        - Resolve issues with supplier.
        - Resubmit invoice for approval.
      - **After Resolution:** Return to **Approve or Reject Invoice**.
- **Role:** Department Manager (Carlos).

#### **8. Schedule Payment**
- **Activity:** Schedule the invoice for payment.
- **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
- **Artifact:** Scheduled payment record.

---

### **Process Variations and Exceptions:**

1. **Missing PO Number:**
   - If the PO number is missing, the Purchasing Officer (Dan) requests the Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) to obtain the missing information before proceeding.

2. **Discrepancies in Invoice Details:**
   - Discrepancies (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items) are resolved through communication between the Accounts Payable Clerk and the Purchasing Department. If unresolved, the issue is escalated to the Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).

3. **Informal Contracts or Services:**
   - Invoices for services contracted informally may not have a PO. The Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) works with department heads to create a retrospective PO or decides if the invoice should be rejected.

4. **Supplier Issues:**
   - If the supplier needs to provide a revised invoice or clarify details, the Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) facilitates communication to resolve issues.

5. **Escalation of Problem Invoices:**
   - Problem invoices that cannot be resolved through standard channels are escalated to the Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) for further action.
