Based on the provided declarative constraints, here's a description of the underlying process:

**Process Name:** Expense Approval Process

**Actors:**
1. Employee
2. Administration (Admin)
3. Supervisor
4. Budget Owner
5. Pre-Approver (optional)

**Process Flow:**

1. **Employee Actions:**
   - The employee can save, submit, or reject their expense declaration.
     - If saved, the process ends there.
     - If submitted, it moves to the next approval level.
     - If rejected by the employee, the process ends.

2. **Pre-Approver Actions (if enabled):**
   - The pre-approver can approve, reject, or save the expense declaration.
     - If approved, it goes to the Admin for final approval.
     - If saved, the process waits until the pre-approver takes further action.
     - If rejected by the pre-approver due to missing information ('Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'), the employee must resubmit.

3. **Admin Actions:**
   - The Admin can approve, reject, or save the expense declaration.
     - If approved, it goes to the Supervisor for final approval.
     - If saved, the process waits until the Admin takes further action.
     - If rejected by the Admin due to missing information ('Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'), the employee must resubmit.

4. **Supervisor Actions:**
   - The Supervisor can approve, reject, or save the expense declaration.
     - If approved, it goes to the Budget Owner for final approval.
     - If saved, the process waits until the Supervisor takes further action.
     - If rejected by the Supervisor due to missing information ('Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'), the employee must resubmit.

5. **Budget Owner Actions:**
   - The Budget Owner can approve or reject the expense declaration.
     - If approved, payment is requested.
     - If rejected, the process ends there.

6. **Payment Process:**
   - Once payment is requested ('Request Payment'), it can be handled ('Payment Handled') only once.

**Additional Constraints:**

- Activities like 'Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', etc., have occurrence bounds specified, indicating the maximum number of times these activities can occur in a single case.
- Some activities are always before or after specific other activities (e.g., 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' is always before 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE').
- Certain activities cannot co-exist within the same case (e.g., 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' cannot happen together).

**Process Summary:**
This process handles expense approvals, involving multiple levels of approval and possible rejections due to missing information. It ensures that each expense declaration goes through the required approval hierarchy before payment is requested.
