2. **Activity Processing Times:**
   - **Metric:** Average time taken to resolve tickets per agent/tier.
   - **Purpose:** Understand efficiency and identify potential bottlenecks.

3. **First-Call Resolution Rate (FCR) for L1:**
   - **Metric:** Percentage of tickets resolved by L1 agents on the first contact.
   - **Purpose:** Measure the effectiveness of L1 agents in handling basic issues.

4. **Frequency of Handling Specific Ticket Types/Skills:**
   - **Metric:** Number of tickets handled per skill category per agent.
   - **Purpose:** Assess the specialization and skill utilization of agents.

#### Process Mining Techniques:
1. **Resource Interaction Analysis:**
   - **Technique:** Analyze the flow of tickets between agents and tiers.
   - **Purpose:** Identify patterns of escalations and reassignments.

2. **Social Network Analysis Based on Handovers:**
   - **Technique:** Visualize the network of ticket handovers between agents.
   - **Purpose:** Identify key agents who frequently receive or pass tickets, indicating potential bottlenecks or expertise hubs.

3. **Role Discovery:**
   - **Technique:** Automatically discover roles based on agent behavior and ticket handling patterns.
   - **Purpose:** Validate and refine the current tier and skill categorization.

#### Skill Utilization Analysis:
1. **Skill Matching:**
   - **Metric:** Percentage of tickets where the assigned agent's skills match the required skills.
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that specialized skills are being utilized effectively.

2. **Skill Overlap:**
   - **Metric:** Number of agents with overlapping skills.
   - **Purpose:** Identify potential redundancies or opportunities for cross-training.

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

#### Specific Resource-Related Problems:
1. **Bottlenecks Due to Skill Availability:**
   - **Issue:** Insufficient agents with specific required skills.
   - **Impact:** Delays in ticket resolution and increased SLA breaches.

2. **Delays from Frequent Reassignments:**
   - **Issue:** Frequent or unnecessary ticket reassignments or escalations.
   - **Impact:** Increased resolution time and potential SLA breaches.

3. **Incorrect Initial Assignments:**
   - **Issue:** Poor initial ticket categorization or skill requirement identification.
   - **Impact:** Inefficient use of resources and increased escalations.

4. **Underperforming or Overloaded Agents:**
   - **Issue:** Agents with consistently high or low workloads.
   - **Impact:** Uneven workload distribution and potential burnout or underutilization.

5. **Correlation with SLA Breaches:**
   - **Issue:** Resource assignment patterns leading to SLA breaches.
   - **Impact:** Customer dissatisfaction and potential financial penalties.

#### Quantifying the Impact:
1. **Average Delay per Reassignment:**
   - **Metric:** Average time added to resolution time per reassignment.
   - **Purpose:** Quantify the impact of reassignments on resolution time.

2. **Percentage of SLA Breaches Linked to Skill Mismatch:**
   - **Metric:** Percentage of SLA breaches where the assigned agent's skills did not match the required skills.
   - **Purpose:** Identify the impact of skill mismatches on SLA compliance.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

#### Potential Root Causes:
1. **Deficiencies in Assignment Rules:**
   - **Issue:** Purely round-robin assignment ignoring skills/workload.
   - **Impact:** Inefficient resource utilization and increased escalations.

2. **Inaccurate Agent Skill Profiles:**
   - **Issue:** Incomplete or outdated skill profiles.
   - **Impact:** Misalignment between ticket requirements and agent capabilities.

3. **Poor Initial Ticket Categorization:**
   - **Issue:** Inaccurate categorization of tickets.
   - **Impact:** Incorrect initial assignments and increased escalations.

4. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
   - **Issue:** No real-time visibility into agent workload and availability.
   - **Impact:** Inefficient resource allocation and increased delays.

5. **Insufficient Training of L1 Agents:**
   - **Issue:** Lack of training or empowerment of L1 agents.
   - **Impact:** Excessive escalations and increased workload for L2/L3 agents.

#### Variant Analysis and Decision Mining:
1. **Variant Analysis:**
   - **Technique:** Compare cases with smooth assignments vs. those with many reassignments.
   - **Purpose:** Identify factors leading to poor assignment decisions.

2. **Decision Mining:**
   - **Technique:** Analyze decision points in the process to understand the logic behind assignments.
   - **Purpose:** Identify patterns and rules that lead to efficient or inefficient assignments.
