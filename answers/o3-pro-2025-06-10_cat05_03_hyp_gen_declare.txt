1. Anomalies in the DECLARE specification  

• Mandatory close vs. forbidden evaluation  
  – Rule “existence(C)” obliges every trace to contain a Close (C).  
  – Rule “noncoexistence(E, C)” forbids E and C in the same trace.  
  – Taken together, the only way to satisfy both is to never perform an Evaluation (E).  
  – This directly contradicts the intended flow where E is a normal step.  
  – Side-effect: every other constraint mentioning E becomes unreachable (“dead”).  

• Direction of the dependency between Assign and Evaluate  
  – “responded_existence(E  A)” means “if E occurs then (somewhere) A must occur,” allowing A to happen after E.  
  – Business reality demands the opposite: an Assign (A) must precede every Evaluate (E).  
  – The current rule can therefore legitimise traces in which the adjuster is assigned only after the claim has already been evaluated.  

• Redundant / weak ordering constraints  
  – “init(R)” already guarantees R is first; “precedence(C, R)” is therefore redundant.  
  – No ordering is enforced for A  E  P  N, so any permutation that still contains R and C would be considered compliant, even though it breaks the intended sequence.  

• Dead-path and vacuity problems  
  – Because E is effectively impossible, the rule “responded_existence(E  A)” can never be activated, inflating support/confidence metrics to 1.0 without any real evidence.  

2. Plausible reasons for the anomalies  

a. Requirement misunderstanding – Evaluation was thought to be optional for certain fast-track claims, so someone inserted a “noncoexistence(E, C)” without realising Close is mandatory.  
b. Incremental policy changes – A new rule “every claim must be closed” was added but an older rule “certain claims skip evaluation” was never removed.  
c. Mining artefact – The model may have been produced by an automated discovery algorithm on incomplete logs that lacked E events, leading to a spurious non-coexistence constraint.  
d. Performance pressure – To shorten cycle time, users occasionally close small claims immediately; the model was tuned to tolerate that behaviour, but it clashes with standard policy.  
e. Copy-paste error – Someone meant to write “precedence(E, A)” but accidentally wrote a responded-existence in the opposite direction.  

3. Suggested SQL checks against the event log  

A. Claims closed without any evaluation  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims            AS c
JOIN claim_events      AS ce_close
  ON ce_close.claim_id = c.claim_id
 AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM claim_events ce_eval
      WHERE ce_eval.claim_id = c.claim_id
        AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
);
```  

B. Traces containing both Evaluate and Close (violates non-coexistence rule)  
```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E','C')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) > 0
   AND COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) > 0;
```  

C. Evaluate occurring before an Assign or without any Assign  
```sql
WITH ae AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS first_a,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS first_e,
         SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN 1 END)          AS a_cnt
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity IN ('A','E')
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id
FROM ae
WHERE first_e IS NOT NULL                -- evaluation happened
  AND (a_cnt = 0 OR first_e < first_a);  -- no assign OR assign after evaluate
```  

D. Missing Close event (checks “existence(C)” against reality)  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce
  ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
 AND ce.activity = 'C'
WHERE ce.event_id IS NULL;
```  

E. Evaluate performed but carried out by a non-specialised adjuster  
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.resource AS adjuster_id
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN adjusters   a ON a.adjuster_id::text = ce.resource
JOIN claims      c ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
  AND (
        (c.claim_type = 'home_insurance' AND a.specialization <> 'home')
     OR (c.claim_type = 'auto_insurance' AND a.specialization <> 'auto')
  );
```  

Running these queries will expose whether the contradictions in the DECLARE model correspond to actual deviations in the recorded claims or stem solely from modelling errors.
