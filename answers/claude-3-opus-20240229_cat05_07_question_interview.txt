Thank you for that detailed explanation of your property onboarding process. I have a few follow-up questions to ensure I fully understand the process:

1. When a property owner first contacts your regional office, what specific documentation do you require them to provide? How do you communicate these requirements to the property owner?

2. If documents are missing or outdated, what is the typical turnaround time for the property owner to provide updates? Is there a maximum number of times you will request updates before deciding not to proceed with onboarding the property?

3. When recording property details in your central database, who is responsible for verifying the accuracy of the information? Is there a review or approval step before the data is finalized in the system?

4. What criteria do you use to determine the "best fit" property manager for a new property? Is this decision made by an individual or a committee?

5. During the introductory meeting between the property manager and landlord, is there a standard agenda or checklist of topics that must be covered? How are the outcomes of this meeting documented and shared with other stakeholders?

6. What specific safety and habitability standards must a property meet to pass the initial inspection? How frequently are properties re-inspected once they are active in your portfolio?

7. If issues are identified during the inspection, is there a timeline or deadline given to the landlord to address them? What happens if the issues are not addressed within that timeline?

8. When marketing materials are created for a new property, what is the review and approval process before they are published? Who has final sign-off?

9. During tenant screening, if there are multiple qualified applicants, what factors determine which tenant is ultimately chosen? Is this decision made solely by the property manager or are other stakeholders involved?

10. What is the standard lease term for new tenants? Under what circumstances do you offer shorter or longer lease terms?

11. Can you walk me through the specific compliance checks that are conducted on a new lease agreement? What happens if a lease is found to be non-compliant?

12. How do you ensure that all stakeholders (regional office, landlord, property manager, support teams) are kept informed of the status of a new property as it moves through the onboarding process? Are there regular status meetings or written updates?

13. Approximately what percentage of new properties require some kind of exception to your standard onboarding process? Can you give some examples of common exceptions and how they are handled?

14. After a property is fully onboarded and active, what kind of ongoing reporting or communication happens between the property manager and the landlord? 

15. Looking at the end-to-end process, what would you say are the most common causes of delays or bottlenecks in getting a new property set up and ready for rental?

Those are my initial questions. Let me know if you need any clarification on what I'm asking, and feel free to elaborate on your answers. I want to make sure I have a thorough understanding of your process.
