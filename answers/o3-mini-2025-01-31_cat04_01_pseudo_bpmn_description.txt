This BPMN pseudo-diagram describes a customer order or request process with decision points (gateways) that lead to different pathways based on the type of customer request (standard or custom), and includes validations, parallel operations, approval loops, and final confirmation. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

1. Start with the Start Event and Task A (“Receive Customer Request”):
• This task marks the entry point into the process. It involves accepting and recording the customer's request so that the appropriate processing steps can be taken.

2. Gateway (XOR) – Check Request Type:
• An Exclusive (XOR) Gateway is used to determine whether the incoming request is standard or custom. Only one path (either standard or custom) is chosen based on this evaluation.

3. Standard Request Path:
• If the request is standard:
a. Task B1 (“Perform Standard Validation”):
– This task verifies that the request meets all basic criteria for standard orders.
b. Gateway (AND) – Run Parallel Checks:
– An AND Gateway is employed here to initiate parallel checks. This implies that multiple validations (in parallel) must be completed before the process can proceed.
• Task C1 (“Credit Check”): One branch, verifying the customer’s credit status.
• Task C2 (“Inventory Check”): The other branch, checking product availability.
c. Join after All Parallel Checks Completed:
– Once both the credit and inventory checks are finished, the process synchronizes again.
d. Task D (“Calculate Delivery Date”):
– Using the validated information from the parallel checks, the process calculates an estimated delivery date for the order.

4. Custom Request Path:
• If the request is custom:
a. Task B2 (“Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”):
– This step involves a detailed examination to assess if the custom requirements can be met.
b. Gateway (XOR) – Is Customization Feasible?
– An XOR decision is used to determine if the customization is viable:
• If Yes: Task E1 (“Prepare Custom Quotation”) is executed. Here, a tailored quotation is prepared based on the custom requirements.
• If No: Task E2 (“Send Rejection Notice”) is performed, ending the process for that request (as indicated by the End Event following this task).

5. Post-Standard or Post-Custom Processing:
• After completing either the standard path (i.e., after calculating the delivery date) or the custom path (i.e., after preparing the custom quotation), the process converges at another decision point.
• Gateway (XOR) – Is Approval Needed?
– This decision checks whether the current request requires managerial approval. The need for approval could depend on factors such as order value, exceptions, or defined business rules.

6. Handling Approval:
• If approval is needed:
a. Task F (“Obtain Manager Approval”):
– This task represents an approval request being sent to a manager for evaluation.
b. Gateway (XOR) – Is Approval Granted?
– An XOR gateway divides the flow based on whether the manager approves:
• If Yes: Task G (“Generate Final Invoice”) proceeds, generating the invoice based on approved details.
• If No: Task H (“Re-evaluate Conditions”) is executed.
– This task indicates that the conditions are reevaluated, and there is a loop-back mechanism:
– For custom order requests, the process loops back to Task E1 (“Prepare Custom Quotation”).
– For standard order requests, it loops back to Task D (“Calculate Delivery Date”).
– This loop allows for corrections, conditional re-assessments, or adjustments before reattempting the approval process.
• If approval is not needed:
– The process goes directly to Task G (“Generate Final Invoice”), bypassing the manager approval steps.

7. Task I – Send Confirmation to Customer:
• Once the final invoice is generated (and thus the order is confirmed on the back end), a confirmation message is sent to the customer. This is the last formal action before termination of the process.

8. End Event:
• This concludes the process once the confirmation has been sent.

In summary:
• The process starts with receiving a request and immediately diverges into either a standard or custom processing pathway based on the type of request.
• Standard requests undergo a validation and parallel check routine (e.g., credit and inventory), followed by delivery date calculation.
• Custom requests require a feasibility check leading to either preparing a custom quotation or rejecting the request if customization isn’t viable.
• After either path, the process may require managerial approval. If approval is needed and granted, the process moves to invoicing; if declined, it triggers a rework loop to re-assess or adjust the request.
• Finally, after generating the final invoice, a confirmation is sent to the customer.
• The gateways clearly delineate decisions (XOR for “either/or” conditions and AND for parallel, simultaneous tasks), while the loop back mechanism provides a system for corrections or re-evaluations following a disapproval.

This explanation clarifies the purpose and connection of each step, the conditional splits (gateways), and the rules governing how and when the request should be reworked or approved.
