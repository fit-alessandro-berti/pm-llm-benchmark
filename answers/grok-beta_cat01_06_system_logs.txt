**Explanation:**

1. **Case Identification:**
   - **Documents**: Each document file (e.g., `Document1.docx`, `Quarterly_Report.docx`) is treated as a separate case. The user's focus on a specific document indicates the start of a new or continued work session on that document.
   - **Email**: Email handling is grouped as a single case since the user interacts with the email inbox to check, respond, and send emails. 
   - **PDF and Excel**: These are also treated as separate cases since the user interacts with them in a distinct manner (reviewing, updating, etc.).

2. **Activity Naming:**
   - **Document Creation**: When a new document is focused on for the first time.
   - **Writing Draft**: When typing occurs in a document.
   - **Saving Document**: When the document is saved.
   - **Check Email**: When the user opens an email or performs actions in the email client.
   - **Respond to Email**: When typing or clicking to reply or compose an email.
   - **Send Email**: When the email is sent.
   - **Review Document**: When interacting with a PDF file.
   - **Update Budget**: When typing in an Excel file, implying budget updates.
   - **Reference Insertion**: When typing in a document after switching from an Excel file, suggesting the insertion of references or data from the budget.
   - **Close Document**: When a document is closed.

3. **Event Attributes:**
   - **Case ID**: The document name, email inbox, or the specific file being worked on.
   - **Activity Name**: Derived from the context of actions performed and the application used.
   - **Timestamp**: The original timestamp from the system log.

4. **Coherent Narrative:**
   - The log tells a story of a user working on multiple documents, managing their email, reviewing a report, updating a budget, and then integrating data from the budget into a document. Each switch in focus or application context indicates a change in the user's work activity or case.

This approach ensures that the event log captures the logical flow of work sessions, making it suitable for process mining analysis to understand how documents are edited, how emails are managed, and how data from spreadsheets influences document creation.
