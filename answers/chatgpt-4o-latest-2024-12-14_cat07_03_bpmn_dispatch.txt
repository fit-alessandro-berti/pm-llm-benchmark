The provided visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)** diagram representing the process of dispatching goods for a computer hardware shop. Here's a breakdown of the process depicted in the diagram:

### **Swimlanes**
- The process is divided into **two swimlanes**, indicating roles or responsibilities:
  1. **Logistics**: Handles coordination, insurance, labeling, and logistics company interactions.
  2. **Warehouse**: Manages packaging, shipment paperwork, and movement of goods.

### **Main Process Flow**
1. **Ship Goods**: 
   - The process begins when goods are ready for shipment.

2. **Clarify Shipment Method**:
   - A decision point determines the **shipment method** based on the order details.

3. **Check if Insurance is Required**:
   - After clarifying the shipment method, the system checks if the shipment requires insurance, based on customer information.
     - If **insurance is necessary**, the process flows to **Insure Parcel**.
     - If **no insurance is required**, it moves forward.

4. **Special Handling?**:
   - Another decision point checks if the shipment needs special handling.
     - If **special handling is required**, three offers are obtained from different logistic companies.
     - The preferred logistics company is then selected, and an order is placed.

5. **Package Goods**:
   - Goods are packaged by the warehouse. A delay of **48 hours** is noted, after which:
     - If a delay occurs, the customer is notified.

6. **Write Package Label**:
   - A label is written for the package.

7. **Fill Out Shipment Paperwork**:
   - After labeling, shipment paperwork is prepared.

8. **Move Package to Pickup Area**:
   - Packaged goods are moved to the pickup area.

9. **Shipment Prepared**:
   - The process ends with the goods ready for shipment.

### **Key Features**
- **Decision Points**:
  - Represented as diamonds, these nodes dictate conditional pathways (e.g., "special handling" or "insurance required").
- **Parallel Processes**:
  - The process splits into multiple activities happening concurrently, such as packaging and logistics coordination.
- **Time Event**:
  - A clock symbol in the warehouse swimlane indicates a 48-hour delay before proceeding further.

### **Overall Purpose**
The BPMN diagram outlines the structured process for handling and dispatching goods, covering logistics, customer communication, and warehouse operations. It highlights decision-making points and ensures a smooth and documented flow from order receipt to shipment preparation.
