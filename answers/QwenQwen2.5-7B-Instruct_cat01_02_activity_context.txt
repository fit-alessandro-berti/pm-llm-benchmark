### Analysis and Renaming of Activities

To effectively rename the activities, we need to identify the distinct contexts in which they appear and then craft new names that reflect those contexts. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Initiate Request**:
    - This activity is the initial step in every case. It generally involves the customer submitting a request through a portal or in person.
    - **New Name**: InitiateRequest (common across all cases, no need to change)

2. **Verify Documents**:
    - This activity is performed multiple times, but it can mean different things depending on whether the documents are initially verified or re-verified after additional information is provided.
    - **New Name**: VerifyInitialDocuments (for the first verification) and VerifyRevisedDocuments (for the re-check after additional information is provided)

3. **Call Customer**:
    - This activity can occur for different reasons: to request additional documents, to clarify an issue, or to follow up on an adjustment.
    - **New Name**: RequestAdditionalInfo (when calling to request more documents), ClarifyIssue (when calling to clarify issues), and ConfirmAdjustment (when following up on adjustments)

4. **Adjust Account**:
    - This activity is only seen once in one case but can be associated with either an internal correction or an adjustment made during a call.
    - **New Name**: InternalAdjustment (if it involves internal corrections) and ExternalAdjustment (if it involves adjustments made during a call)

5. **Approve Request**:
    - This is the final step in the process, where the supervisor gives the final approval.
    - **New Name**: FinalApproval (common across all cases, no need to change)

### Justification for Naming Choices

1. **VerifyInitialDocuments** and **VerifyRevisedDocuments**:
    - **InitialVerification**: This name is used for the first check of documents when the customer initially submits the request.
    - **RevisedVerification**: This name is used when the documents are re-checked after the customer provides additional information or documents.

2. **RequestAdditionalInfo** and **ClarifyIssue** and **ConfirmAdjustment**:
    - **RequestAdditionalInfo**: This name is used when the agent calls the customer to request more documents.
    - **ClarifyIssue**: This name is used when the agent calls to clarify an issue with the account.
    - **ConfirmAdjustment**: This name is used when the agent follows up to confirm adjustments made after a call.

3. **InternalAdjustment** and **ExternalAdjustment**:
    - **InternalCorrection**: This name is used when the correction is made internally, without involving the customer.
    - **ExternalCorrection**: This name is used when the correction involves an external call to the customer.

By renaming the activities, we have made the process flow more understandable and the context of each activity clearer.
