 Based on the data provided, here are some observations and main differences:

1. Frequency of each pathway: The most common sequence of events leading to a successful discharge is "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge". This pathway has the highest frequency (265 occurrences).

   After this, the second most common pathways are "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" and "Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge", with 190 and 192 occurrences, respectively.

   The least common pathway is "Register at ER/FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge", with only 16 occurrences at ER and 15 occurrences at FD.

2. Performance of each pathway: The overall performance (sum of frequencies multiplied by the performance score) is highest for "Register at ER/FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge". However, it's interesting to note that the least common pathways have surprisingly high performance scores, suggesting that they may still contribute significantly to resource utilization and patient outcomes.

3. Number of steps: The paths with the highest frequency and performance (i.e., those involving an "unsuccessful" treatment step) have more steps than the pathway without such a step ("Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge"). This suggests that these longer paths might be associated with more complications or complex cases, which may require multiple rounds of treatment before achieving a successful outcome.

4. Starting location: The majority of paths start at either the ER or FD (Emergency Room or Family Doctor), indicating that patients often seek immediate medical attention for their health issues.

5. Involvement of Expert Examination: Pathways that include an "Expert Examination" step have higher frequencies and performances compared to those without this step, suggesting that expert consultations play a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment process, especially in complex cases.

6. Number of unsuccessful treatments: Pathways involving one or more unsuccessful treatments generally have lower frequencies but higher performance scores than pathways without them. This may indicate that patients who require multiple rounds of treatments are more resource-intensive but also have a greater impact on overall outcomes.

In summary, the main differences between these paths include their frequency, performance, number of steps, starting location, involvement of expert examinations, and number of unsuccessful treatments. These factors can help in understanding various aspects of patient care, resource allocation, and clinical decision-making processes.
