Below is one way to aggregate the lowlevel events into higherlevel process steps, plus the rules/rationale so this can be applied to the full log.

---

## 1. Proposed HighLevel Activities

### Step 1 – **Material Identification & Preparation**

**Included lowlevel events (per CaseID):**

- Retrieve raw metal sheet – Operator A  
- Scan barcode – Operator A  
- Place metal sheet on table – Operator A  
- Align metal sheet – Robot Arm #2  
- Preheat metal sheet – Heating Unit #1  

**Example (Case A1):**

- 2024-03-01 08:00:05 | Retrieve raw metal sheet  
- 2024-03-01 08:00:07 | Scan barcode  
- 2024-03-01 08:00:10 | Place metal sheet on table  
- 2024-03-01 08:00:15 | Align metal sheet  
- 2024-03-01 08:00:20 | Preheat metal sheet  

**Rationale:**

- **Logical function:** All these actions prepare a raw metal sheet so it is correctly identified, positioned, and thermally ready for downstream processing.
- **Temporal coherence:** They occur as a tight cluster at the beginning of the case, with no intervening, unrelated tasks.
- **Conceptual unity:**
  - Retrieval + scanning = material identification and traceability.
  - Placing + aligning = positioning for processing.
  - Preheating = last preparation step before welding.
- **Resource pattern:** Starts with human operator (material handling + identification), transitions to equipment (robot/oven) but still all clearly before any joining/assembly work.

**Proposed name:**  
**Material Identification & Preparation**  
(Alternative: “Raw Material Setup”)

### Step 2 – **Welding Operation**

**Included lowlevel events (per CaseID):**

- Pick up welding tool – Operator B  
- Weld corner A – Operator B  
- Weld corner B – Operator B  

**Example (Case A1):**

- 2024-03-01 08:01:00 | Pick up welding tool  
- 2024-03-01 08:01:05 | Weld corner A  
- 2024-03-01 08:01:10 | Weld corner B  

**Rationale:**

- **Logical function:** These actions collectively perform the core joining operation on the prepared part.
- **Temporal coherence:** They are consecutive and directly follow material preparation, with very small gaps.
- **Process logic:** Picking up the welding tool is a preparatory substep to the actual welding, but it’s tightly and exclusively associated with the welding tasks; there are no other operations with that tool in between.
- **Resource pattern:** Same operator (Operator B) across these events, focused on welding.

**Proposed name:**  
**Welding Operation**  
(Alternative: “Joining Process”)

### Step 3 – **InProcess Weld Quality Verification**

**Included lowlevel events (per CaseID):**

- Measure weld integrity – Quality Sensor #1  

**Example (Case A1):**

- 2024-03-01 08:01:20 | Measure weld integrity | IntegrityScore: 95  

**Rationale:**

- **Logical function:** This is a check to verify the outcome of the welding operation before additional valueadding steps (like coating) are performed.
- **Temporal position:** Occurs immediately after welding, before any finishing operations.
- **Distinct role:** Performed by a dedicated quality resource (Quality Sensor #1), and conceptually different from both welding and final product release.

**Proposed name:**  
**InProcess Weld Quality Verification**  
(Alternative: “Weld Integrity Check”)

---

### Step 4 – **Surface Finishing & Coating**

**Included lowlevel events (per CaseID):**

- Apply protective coating – Coating Unit #3  
- Dry coating – Heating Unit #2  

**Example (Case A1):**

- 2024-03-01 08:01:30 | Apply protective coating  
- 2024-03-01 08:01:45 | Dry coating  

**Rationale:**

- **Logical function:** These steps modify the product’s surface to meet protective and aesthetic requirements (application + curing).
- **Temporal coherence:** They occur as a pair right after weld quality verification.
- **Conceptual unity:** Application and drying are sequential substeps of a single “coating” process; drying has no independent meaning outside the context of the coating it cures.
- **Resource pattern:** Specialized finishing equipment (coating unit, heating unit) distinct from previous preparation/welding resources.

**Proposed name:**  
**Surface Finishing & Coating**  
(Alternative: “Protective Coating Application”)

---

### Step 5 – **Final Visual Quality Inspection**

**Included lowlevel events (per CaseID):**

- Visual check – Operator C  

**Example (Case A1):**

- 2024-03-01 08:02:00 | Visual check | Check: Passed  

**Rationale:**

- **Logical function:** This is a final, humandriven inspection of the finished part to ensure it meets quality standards before it leaves the process.
- **Temporal position:** Last event in the case; follows all transformation steps.
- **Distinct role:** Different resource type (human inspector) and different purpose (release decision rather than process execution).

**Proposed name:**  
**Final Visual Quality Inspection**  
(Alternative: “Final Inspection & Release Check”)

## 3. Generalizable Grouping Rules

To apply this to the full log:

1. **Segment by CaseID** and order events by timestamp.
2. **Identify phases by key “anchor” activities:**
   - First appearance of “Retrieve raw metal sheet”  start of **Material Identification & Preparation**; ends at “Preheat metal sheet”.
   - “Pick up welding tool” through the last “Weld …” activity  **Welding Operation**.
   - First “Measure weld integrity” after welding  **InProcess Weld Quality Verification**.
   - “Apply protective coating” through “Dry coating”  **Surface Finishing & Coating**.
   - Last “Visual check” before case completion  **Final Visual Quality Inspection**.
3. **Timecloseness rule:** If other minor lowlevel events (e.g., microadjustments, sensor pings) appear between these anchors but are:
   - within a short time window, and  
   - clearly related to the same physical task,  
   group them into the surrounding highlevel step.
4. **Resourcetype hint:**  
   - Material handling/identification  preparation step.  
   - Welding tool + Operator B or welding robot  welding step.  
   - Quality sensors  inprocess quality step.  
   - Coating/curing units  finishing step.  
   - Human inspector  final inspection step.

This yields a compact, interpretable process model from the granular event log.
