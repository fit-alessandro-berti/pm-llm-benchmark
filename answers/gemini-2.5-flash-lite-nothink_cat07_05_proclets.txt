The visualization appears to be a combination of three diagrams related to a laboratory testing process.

**Diagram (a): Two proclets classes connected through two channels**

This is a process flow diagram that depicts the steps involved in a laboratory test. It uses a notation that suggests a process-oriented approach with explicitly defined channels for communication.

*   **Actors/Roles:** Several roles are identified, including "doctor," "lab assistant," and "chemical analyst."
*   **Process Steps:** The process starts with a "Lab visit." Key steps include "Order entry," "Take blood sample," "Receive result," "Judge results," "Do tests again," "Receive updated result," "Send report," "Perform test," "Make report," "Finish lab test," and "Provide updated report."
*   **Channels:** The diagram highlights communication channels, illustrated by lines connecting different process steps. Some of these channels are grouped within dashed boxes labeled "Order system" and "HIS" (Hospital Information System). The notation on the channels (e.g., "1,1", "1,?") likely indicates communication patterns or properties.
*   **Decisions/Conditions:** The green box labeled "Judge results" and the box "Everything fine" suggest decision points in the process.
*   **Channels as Communication Mechanisms:** The lines represent the flow of information or tasks between different parts of the system or different actors. For example, a result is "Received" and then "Judged."

**Diagram (b): Class diagram containing the two proclet classes**

This is a simple class diagram that shows the relationship between "Lab visit" and "Lab test."

*   **Classes:** Two classes are presented: "Lab visit" and "Lab test."
*   **Relationship:** A relationship labeled "requires" connects these two classes.
*   **Cardinality:** The cardinality of the relationship is indicated as "1..1" from "Lab visit" to "Lab test," and "1..*" from "Lab test" to "Lab visit." This suggests that a single "Lab visit" requires at least one "Lab test," and a "Lab test" can be part of multiple "Lab visits" (though the diagram might imply a specific association here rather than a general rule). This diagram likely defines the core entities involved in the process described in (a).

**Diagram (c): Example of a performative**

This is a tabular representation of a single "performative" message. Performatives are speech acts that directly influence the state of affairs, such as creating, requesting, or confirming.

*   **Columns:** The table includes columns for "Time," "Channel," "Sender," "Receivers," "Action," "Content," "Scope," and "Direction."
*   **Message Details:** The example shows a message sent at "11:00" via the "Order system" channel. The "Sender" is "Lab visit - John," and the "Receivers" are "Lab test - HGB John." The "Action" is "Create," and the "Content" is "Can you perform a HGB test for John?" The "Scope" is "Private," and the "Direction" is "OUT." This table provides a concrete example of the communication that might occur within the process described in diagram (a).

**Overall Purpose:**

The visualization collectively illustrates a laboratory testing workflow, its underlying data structure (class diagram), and an example of the communication that drives the process (performative). It seems to be explaining how a laboratory process can be modeled and how interactions within that process can be formally described.
