# Process Mining Analysis of Manufacturing Assembly Line Events

## Activity Grouping and Labeling

After analyzing the event log, I've identified the following distinct phases and assigned meaningful labels to each:

### 1. **Machine Idle / Initialization**
- **Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15
- **Characteristics:**
  - Low temperature (20-21°C)
  - Minimal pressure (1 bar)
  - No vibration (0 Hz)
  - No material flow (0 units/s)
  - Tool at position 0 mm
  - Low energy consumption (0.40-0.50 kWh)
- **Rationale:** These readings indicate the machine is in a non-operational state, either starting up or between operations. The lack of activity across all sensors suggests the machine is idle or in a reset state.

### 2. **Material Processing / Cutting**
- **Events:** 4, 5, 6
- **Characteristics:**
  - Rapid temperature increase (20°C to 58°C)
  - Increased pressure (1 to 1.5 bar)
  - High vibration (30-38 Hz)
  - Constant material flow (5 units/s)
  - Tool position advancing (5-10 mm)
  - High energy consumption (2.00-3.00 kWh)
- **Rationale:** The sharp rise in temperature and vibration, combined with consistent material flow and energy consumption, strongly suggests a cutting operation. The advancing tool position supports this interpretation as the tool moves through the material.

### 3. **Assembly / Positioning**
- **Events:** 7, 8
- **Characteristics:**
  - Temperature drops to 40°C
  - Pressure increases to 2 bar
  - Low vibration (10 Hz)
  - Reduced material flow (2 units/s)
  - Tool position continues to advance (15 mm)
  - Energy consumption at 2.00 kWh
- **Rationale:** The stable, moderate conditions with continued tool advancement suggest a positioning or assembly phase. The reduced vibration and material flow indicate a more controlled, precise operation rather than a high-energy process like cutting.

### 4. **Welding / Heat Treatment**
- **Events:** 9
- **Characteristics:**
  - Sharp temperature spike to 80°C
  - Pressure remains at 2 bar
  - High vibration (50 Hz)
  - No material flow (0 units/s)
  - Tool position remains at 15 mm
  - Highest energy consumption (5.00 kWh)
- **Rationale:** The dramatic temperature increase and high vibration with no material flow strongly suggest a welding or heat treatment process. The lack of material movement indicates this is a localized heat application, and the high energy consumption is consistent with welding operations.

### 5. **Cooling / Inspection**
- **Events:** 10, 11, 12
- **Characteristics:**
  - Temperature decreases (80°C to 25°C)
  - Pressure returns to 1 bar
  - Low vibration (1-5 Hz)
  - Minimal material flow (0-1 units/s)
  - Tool position at 15 mm initially, then 20 mm
  - Low energy consumption (1.00-1.60 kWh)
- **Rationale:** The cooling phase is indicated by the temperature decrease. The final positioning of the tool at 20 mm and the low energy consumption suggest this could also be a quality inspection phase, where the part is cooled and possibly measured or inspected.

## Process Flow Summary

The inferred process flow appears to be:
1. **Machine Idle / Initialization**
2. **Material Processing / Cutting**
3. **Assembly / Positioning**
4. **Welding / Heat Treatment**
5. **Cooling / Inspection**
6. **Machine Idle / Initialization**

This sequence represents a complete manufacturing cycle from raw material processing through to final inspection, with distinct phases that can be clearly identified through the sensor data patterns.
