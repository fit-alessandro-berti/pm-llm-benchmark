We are given an event log for a customer support ticket resolution process. We need to identify cases with significantly longer total resolution times, determine potential root causes, and propose insights/recommendations.

First, let's compute the total resolution time for each case. The resolution time is from the first event (Receive Ticket) to the last event (Close Ticket). We'll calculate the duration in hours or minutes for each case.

Case 101:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:00
- End: 2024-03-01 10:15
Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes = 2.25 hours.

Case 102:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:05
- End: 2024-03-02 09:15
This spans over two days. From 08:05 to 09:15 next day. Calculate: 
Day 1: from 08:05 to midnight: 15 hours 55 minutes (but we can compute exact difference). 
Better: Total hours = (2024-03-02 09:15) - (2024-03-01 08:05) = 1 day + 1 hour 10 minutes? Actually, 1 day is 24 hours, plus from 00:00 to 09:15 is 9:15, minus from 08:05 to 00:00 is 15:55, so total = 24 + 9:15 - 15:55? Wait, no: The difference is: 
From 2024-03-01 08:05 to 2024-03-02 08:05 is exactly 24 hours. Then from 08:05 to 09:15 is 1 hour 10 minutes. So total = 25 hours 10 minutes = 25.1667 hours.

Alternatively, compute in minutes: 
Start: day1 8:05 = 8*60+5 = 485 minutes from midnight.
End: day2 9:15 = (24*60) + 9*60+15 = 1440 + 555 = 1995 minutes from midnight of day1.
Difference = 1995 - 485 = 1510 minutes = 1510/60 = 25.1667 hours.

Case 103:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:10
- End: 2024-03-01 09:30
Duration: 1 hour 20 minutes = 1.333 hours.

Case 104:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:20
- End: 2024-03-02 08:30
Duration: 1 day + 10 minutes? From 08:20 to 08:20 next day = 24 hours, plus 10 minutes = 24.1667 hours? Actually, compute: 
From 2024-03-01 08:20 to 2024-03-02 08:20 = 24 hours. Then from 08:20 to 08:30 = 10 minutes, total = 24 hours 10 minutes = 24.1667 hours.

Case 105:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:25
- End: 2024-03-03 09:30
Duration: 2 days + 1 hour 5 minutes? From 08:25 to 08:25 on 3rd = 48 hours, plus from 08:25 to 09:30 = 1 hour 5 minutes, total = 49 hours 5 minutes = 49.0833 hours.

So durations:
- Case 101: 2.25 hours
- Case 102: 25.17 hours
- Case 103: 1.33 hours
- Case 104: 24.17 hours
- Case 105: 49.08 hours

Clearly, cases 102, 104, and 105 have much longer resolution times compared to 101 and 103. Cases 102 and 104 take about a day, and case 105 takes about two days. So these are the significantly longer ones.

Now, we need to determine potential root causes. We should look at the event sequences and timestamps to identify where delays occur.

Let's examine each long case in detail:

Case 102:
- Receive: 08:05
- Triage: 08:30 (25 minutes later)
- Assign to L1: 09:00 (30 minutes after triage, 55 minutes after receive)
- Escalate to L2: 11:30 (2.5 hours after assign)
- Investigate Issue: 14:00 (2.5 hours after escalate)
- Resolve: next day 09:00 (19 hours after investigate? Actually, from 14:00 to 09:00 next day is 19 hours, but note that there is likely overnight non-working hours? But we need to consider working hours? The process might operate only during business hours. However, the timestamps show activities happening at 08:00, 09:00, etc., suggesting typical business hours (maybe 8am to 5pm). So the delay from 14:00 to next day 09:00 might include non-working hours. But still, it's a long delay. Also, there is a delay before investigation after escalation. Possibly the escalation caused a handoff delay.

Case 104:
- Receive: 08:20
- Triage: 09:00 (40 minutes later)
- Assign to L1: 09:30 (30 minutes after triage)
- Investigate Issue: 13:00 (3.5 hours after assign)
- Resolve: next day 08:00 (19 hours after investigate? Actually, from 13:00 to next day 08:00 is 19 hours, again likely overnight)
- Close: 08:30 (30 minutes after resolve)

Case 105:
- Receive: 08:25
- Triage: 08:35 (10 minutes)
- Assign to L1: 09:00 (25 minutes after triage)
- Investigate Issue: 09:10 (10 minutes after assign)
- Escalate to L2: 10:00 (50 minutes after investigate)
- Investigate Issue (again?): next day 14:00 (quite long gap: from 10:00 to next day 14:00 is 28 hours? Actually, from day1 10:00 to day2 14:00 is 28 hours, again likely overnight)
- Resolve: day3 09:00 (from day2 14:00 to day3 09:00 is 19 hours)
- Close: day3 09:30 (30 minutes after resolve)

Now, compare with the shorter cases:

Case 101:
- Receive: 08:00
- Triage: 08:10 (10 min)
- Assign: 08:20 (10 min)
- Investigate: 09:00 (40 min after assign? Actually, 08:20 to 09:00 is 40 min, but still within same hour)
- Resolve: 10:00 (1 hour after investigate)
- Close: 10:15 (15 min)

Case 103:
- Receive: 08:10
- Triage: 08:15 (5 min)
- Assign: 08:30 (15 min)
- Investigate: 08:45 (15 min)
- Resolve: 09:15 (30 min)
- Close: 09:30 (15 min)

So the short cases have relatively quick transitions between activities, and no escalations.

Observations:
1. Escalations appear in cases 102 and 105, and both have long resolution times. However, case 104 does not have an escalation but still has a long resolution time. So escalation is not the only factor.
2. Long waiting times between activities: In case 102, there is a 2.5-hour wait between Assign and Escalate, and another 2.5-hour wait between Escalate and Investigate. In case 104, there is a 3.5-hour wait between Assign and Investigate. In case 105, there is a 50-minute wait between first Investigate and Escalate, but then a huge gap of 28 hours before the next Investigate (after escalation). 
3. Also, in cases 102 and 104, the Investigate to Resolve step spans overnight (from afternoon to next morning). This suggests that maybe the investigation took a long time, or there was a delay in resuming work. Possibly the support team works only during business hours, and if an issue is not resolved within the same day, it gets pushed to the next day. That could explain the overnight gaps. But in case 101 and 103, the tickets were resolved the same day, so they didn't experience overnight delays.
4. Another pattern: In case 104, there is no escalation, but there is a long delay between Assign and Investigate (3.5 hours) and then from Investigate to Resolve (overnight). Possibly the Level-1 agent took a long time to start investigation after assignment, or there was a queue.
5. In case 105, after escalation, there is a very long delay before the next Investigate (28 hours). Possibly the Level-2 team has a backlog or the ticket waited in a queue.

Potential root causes:
- Escalations introduce handoff delays and potentially longer processing times if the specialized team is busy.
- Long waiting times between activities, especially before investigation, indicate possible bottlenecks in agent availability or prioritization.
- Tickets that are not resolved within the same business day incur overnight delays, which significantly increase cycle time. This could be due to lack of follow-up or shift handovers.
- Possibly, tickets that require more complex investigation (leading to escalation or longer investigation) are prone to delays.

Let's compute the active working time vs. idle/waiting time. But we don't have information about working hours. Assuming business hours are from 8:00 to 17:00 (9 hours per day). Then overnight gaps are non-working hours. However, some activities occur at 14:00, 09:00, etc., which are within typical business hours. So the delays within the same day (like 3.5 hours between Assign and Investigate in case 104) might be within working hours, indicating that the agent did not start investigation immediately. That could be due to high workload or low priority.

Also, note that in case 102, after escalation, the investigation happens at 14:00, which is still same day, but then resolution is next morning. So maybe the investigation took time, but the actual resolution decision was made next day.

We can break down the time between consecutive events for each case to see where the longest delays occur.

I'll create a table of intervals for each case:

Case 101:
- Receive to Triage: 10 min
- Triage to Assign: 10 min
- Assign to Investigate: 40 min
- Investigate to Resolve: 60 min
- Resolve to Close: 15 min

Case 102:
- Receive to Triage: 25 min
- Triage to Assign: 30 min
- Assign to Escalate: 2h 30min (150 min)
- Escalate to Investigate: 2h 30min (150 min)
- Investigate to Resolve: 19h (overnight, but if working hours: from 14:00 to 17:00 is 3h, then from 8:00 to 9:00 next day is 1h, so active working time might be 4h, but idle overnight is 15h? Actually, we need to consider if work continues after 17:00? The timestamps are all during daytime, so likely work stops at 17:00. So the 19h gap includes non-working hours. But we need to see if the delay is due to non-working time or actual processing delay. Possibly the investigation took long and was completed next morning.)
- Resolve to Close: 15 min

Case 103:
- Receive to Triage: 5 min
- Triage to Assign: 15 min
- Assign to Investigate: 15 min
- Investigate to Resolve: 30 min
- Resolve to Close: 15 min

Case 104:
- Receive to Triage: 40 min
- Triage to Assign: 30 min
- Assign to Investigate: 3h 30min (210 min)
- Investigate to Resolve: 19h (from 13:00 to next day 8:00: includes overnight)
- Resolve to Close: 30 min

Case 105:
- Receive to Triage: 10 min
- Triage to Assign: 25 min
- Assign to Investigate: 10 min
- Investigate to Escalate: 50 min
- Escalate to Investigate (2nd): 28h (from 10:00 to next day 14:00)
- Investigate (2nd) to Resolve: 19h (from 14:00 to next day 9:00)
- Resolve to Close: 30 min

The longest delays are:
- In case 105: 28h between Escalate and second Investigate, and 19h between second Investigate and Resolve.
- In case 102: 150 min between Assign and Escalate, 150 min between Escalate and Investigate, and 19h between Investigate and Resolve.
- In case 104: 210 min between Assign and Investigate, and 19h between Investigate and Resolve.

Note that the 19h gaps appear in multiple cases and likely represent overnight delays. But why do some tickets have overnight delays? Possibly because they were not resolved by end of day. For example, in case 102, investigation started at 14:00, and maybe it required more time, so it carried over to next day. In case 104, investigation started at 13:00, but resolution happened next morning. In case 105, after escalation, the second investigation started at 14:00 next day, and then resolution next morning again.

It seems that if a ticket is not resolved by the end of the business day, it gets postponed to the next day, adding roughly 15-16 hours of non-working time. This is a major factor in long cycle times.

Also, there are significant within-day delays: e.g., in case 104, 3.5 hours from Assign to Investigate. This could be due to agent workload or ticket prioritization.

Another factor: escalations lead to additional handoffs and possibly queueing in the Level-2 team. In case 105, the escalation happened at 10:00, but the Level-2 agent didn't start investigation until 14:00 the next day. That's a very long wait. Possibly Level-2 team has limited capacity or works on a different schedule.

Now, we need to propose insights and recommendations.

Insights:
1. Escalations significantly increase resolution time, not only due to additional processing but also due to handoff delays and potential queueing for specialized agents.
2. Long waiting times between assignment and investigation indicate that Level-1 agents might be overloaded, leading to delays in starting work on new tickets.
3. Tickets that are not resolved within the same business day incur substantial overnight delays, which greatly extend the total cycle time. This suggests that there may be no follow-up or urgency to resolve tickets before the end of the day.
4. The process might benefit from better prioritization and scheduling to avoid carrying over tickets to the next day.

Recommendations:
1. Monitor and reduce handoff times between teams. For escalations, ensure that Level-2 agents are notified promptly and have clear service level agreements (SLAs) for picking up escalated tickets.
2. Analyze workload distribution among Level-1 agents to ensure that tickets are assigned evenly and agents have capacity to start investigation promptly after assignment.
3. Implement policies or incentives to encourage resolution of tickets within the same business day, especially for tickets that are received early in the day. This could involve setting deadlines or prioritizing tickets based on their age.
4. Consider extending support hours or having overlapping shifts to handle tickets that would otherwise wait overnight.
5. For tickets that require escalation, consider having Level-1 agents gather more information upfront to reduce the time needed by Level-2 agents, or implement a parallel processing approach where Level-2 agents are involved earlier.
6. Use process mining to identify bottlenecks and continuously monitor performance metrics like time between activities.

Now, we need to present the answer in a structured way.

Let's answer the specific questions:

1. Identify which cases have significantly longer total resolution times.
   Cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer resolution times (approximately 25 hours, 24 hours, and 49 hours respectively) compared to cases 101 and 103 (approximately 2 hours and 1.3 hours).

2. Determine potential root causes.
   - Escalations: Cases 102 and 105 involved escalations to Level-2 agents, which introduced additional handoff delays and queueing times.
   - Long waiting times between activities: For example, in case 104, there was a 3.5-hour delay between assignment and investigation; in case 102, there were 2.5-hour delays between assign and escalate and between escalate and investigate.
   - Overnight delays: Tickets that were not resolved by the end of the business day experienced long idle periods (approx. 15-16 hours) until the next working day, significantly increasing cycle times. This affected cases 102, 104, and 105.
   - Possibly, tickets that require more complex investigation (leading to longer investigation times or escalations) are more likely to span multiple days.

3. Explain how these factors lead to increased cycle times and propose insights/recommendations.
   - Escalations lead to additional steps and potential bottlenecks in the Level-2 queue.
   - Within-day delays indicate resource constraints or poor prioritization.
   - Overnight delays indicate that the process is not designed for continuous operation, and tickets that are not completed by end-of-day suffer significant delays.
   - Recommendations: Improve handoff processes, balance workloads, set SLAs for each step, consider shift patterns to reduce overnight gaps, and implement strategies to resolve tickets within the same day.

Now, I'll write the final answer.

### 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

The total resolution time (from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket") for each case is as follows:

- **Case 101**: 2.25 hours  
- **Case 102**: 25.17 hours  
- **Case 103**: 1.33 hours  
- **Case 104**: 24.17 hours  
- **Case 105**: 49.08 hours  

**Cases 102, 104, and 105** have significantly longer resolution times compared to Cases 101 and 103. These three cases take approximately 1–2 days to resolve, while the shorter cases are completed within a few hours.

### 2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

Analysis of the event log reveals several patterns contributing to delays:

#### a. **Escalations Introduce Handoff Delays**
- **Case 102** and **Case 105** involve escalations to a Level2 agent. Both experience long waiting times after escalation:
  - In Case 102, there is a 2.5hour delay between “Assign to Level1 Agent” and “Escalate to Level2 Agent,” and another 2.5hour delay before investigation after escalation.
  - In Case 105, after escalation, there is a 28hour gap before the next “Investigate Issue” activity, indicating potential queueing or backlog in the Level2 team.

#### b. **Long WithinDay Waiting Times Between Activities**
- Even without escalation, **Case 104** shows a 3.5hour delay between “Assign to Level1 Agent” and “Investigate Issue.” This suggests that Level1 agents may be overloaded or tickets are not prioritized for immediate action.

#### c. **Overnight Delays Extend Cycle Times**
- Cases 102, 104, and 105 all have gaps of approximately 15–19 hours between “Investigate Issue” and “Resolve Ticket” (or between escalation and investigation in Case 105). These gaps align with nonworking hours (e.g., from afternoon to the next morning). Tickets that are not resolved by the end of the business day incur substantial idle time, drastically increasing total resolution time.

#### d. **Complexity Leading to MultiDay Processing**
- Tickets that require escalation or longer investigation tend to spill over into the next business day, compounding delays. For example, Case 105 involves two investigation steps and spans three days.

---

### 3. Insights and Recommendations

#### Insights:
- **Escalations are a major bottleneck** due to handoff delays and potential resource constraints in specialized teams.
- **Withinday waiting times** indicate inefficiencies in assignment, prioritization, or agent workload management.
- **Overnight delays** contribute significantly to long cycle times, especially for tickets that are not resolved within the same business day.
- **The process is highly sensitive to delays early in the workflow**; longer initial wait times often lead to tickets crossing day boundaries.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Reduce Handoff Delays**  
   - Implement clear SLAs for escalations, ensuring Level2 agents pick up tickets within a defined timeframe.  
   - Use automated alerts or prioritization rules to expedite escalated tickets.

2. **Optimize Workload Distribution**  
   - Monitor and balance assignments among Level1 agents to minimize delays between assignment and investigation.  
   - Consider dynamic prioritization based on ticket age or complexity.

3. **Minimize Overnight Delays**  
   - Encourage resolution of tickets received early in the day before the end of business hours.  
   - Introduce shift overlaps or extended support hours to handle tickets that would otherwise wait overnight.  
   - Implement a followup mechanism for pending tickets at the end of the day.

4. **Improve Escalation Process**  
   - Empower Level1 agents with more information or tools to resolve common issues without escalation.  
   - Consider parallel processing where Level2 agents are consulted earlier for complex tickets.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**  
   - Use process mining to regularly analyze bottlenecks and track metrics like timebetweenactivities and sameday resolution rates.  
   - Set targets for each process step and investigate deviations promptly.

By addressing these areas, the support process can reduce overall resolution times, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency.
