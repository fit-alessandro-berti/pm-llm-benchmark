Here's a **DuckDB SQL query** that fulfills the requirements of your prompt step-by-step:

---

### **Step-by-step Explanation**

#### **1. Extract the ordered sequence of activities per `case_id`**
We need to group by `case_id`, sort by `timestamp`, and concatenate the `activity` names in order.

#### **2. Group by the full activity sequence to identify process variants**
We'll use the concatenated sequence as a key to group and count the number of cases per variant.

#### **3. Find the top K variants by frequency**
We'll rank the variants by their frequency and select the top K.

#### **4. Return all events from cases that belong to the top K variants**

###  **Final DuckDB SQL Query**

```sql
WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM
        ordered_activities
    GROUP BY
        variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant
    FROM
        variant_counts
    ORDER BY
        count DESC
    LIMIT K
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM
        ordered_activities
    WHERE
        variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_k_variants)
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
INNER JOIN
    filtered_cases fc
ON
    e.case_id = fc.case_id
ORDER BY
    e.timestamp;
```

###  Notes:

- Replace `K` with the actual number of top variants you want to select (e.g., `LIMIT 5` for top 5).
- `STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp)` is used to build the activity sequence per case. DuckDB supports `STRING_AGG` with an `ORDER BY` clause.
- The query ensures that **only the events from cases in the top K variants** are returned in the final output.

###  Example with `K = 3`:

```sql
...
LIMIT 3
...
```

Let me know if you want to adapt this for a specific value of `K` or need it in a different SQL dialect (e.g., PostgreSQL, Spark SQL).
