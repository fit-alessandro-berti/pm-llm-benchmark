# **Data-Driven Process Mining Approach for Optimizing IT Service Management at TechSolve Solutions**

## **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

### **Key Metrics for Analysis**
To assess the current state of resource assignment, we would analyze the following metrics from the event log:

- **Individual Agent Performance:**
  - **Workload Distribution:** Number of tickets handled per agent, average time spent per ticket, and idle time.
  - **First-Call Resolution Rate (FCRR):** Percentage of tickets resolved by L1 agents without escalation.
  - **Activity Processing Times:** Average duration of each activity (e.g., work start to work end, escalation delays, reassignment delays).
  - **Skill Utilization:** Frequency with which agents are assigned tickets matching their documented skills vs. those requiring different skills.

- **Tier-Specific Performance:**
  - **Escalation Rates:** Percentage of tickets escalated from L1 to L2/L3 by category, priority, and skill requirement.
  - **Resolution Time by Tier:** Average time to resolution for tickets handled exclusively at L1 vs. those escalated to L2/L3.
  - **Reassignment Frequency:** Number of reassignments per ticket and their impact on resolution time.

### **Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Analysis**
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** Tracks how tickets flow between agents and tiers, identifying bottlenecks where tickets get stuck due to skill mismatches or excessive reassignments.
- **Social Network Analysis:** Visualizes handovers between agents and tiers to detect:
  - Frequent reassignments between specific agents (indicating skill gaps or workload imbalances).
  - Over-reliance on certain L2/L3 specialists (suggesting underutilization of other specialists).
- **Role Discovery:** Identifies deviation from intended assignment logic (e.g., L1 agents handling L2 tasks due to round-robin assignment rather than skill matching).

### **Skill Utilization Analysis**
- **Skill Matching Efficiency:** Compare required skills (e.g., "App-CRM") against assigned agent skills to quantify mismatches.
- **Specialist Underutilization:** Identify highly skilled L2/L3 agents frequently working on tasks that could be handled by L1.
- **Skill Gaps:** Determine if certain skills (e.g., "Security-IAM") are underrepresented, causing delays when needed.

## **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

### **Key Bottlenecks and Problems**
- **Bottlenecks Due to Skill Shortages:**
  - If certain skills (e.g., "Database-SQL") are in high demand but few agents possess them, tickets requiring these skills will experience delays.
  - Quantifiable impact: Measure average resolution time for tickets requiring rare skills vs. common ones.

- **Excessive Reassignments:**
  - Each reassignment adds overhead (e.g., 10 minutes per reassignment).
  - If tickets are reassigned 2-3 times on average, this contributes to SLA breaches.

- **Incorrect Initial Assignments:**
  - L1 agents or dispatchers may assign tickets incorrectly due to:
    - Misinterpretation of required skills.
    - Round-robin assignment ignoring skill matching.
  - Impact: Increased escalations and resolution time.

- **Overloaded vs. Underutilized Agents:**
  - Some agents may be handling 20+ tickets daily while others handle 5, leading to uneven workload distribution.

- **SLA Breach Correlation:**
  - Analyze if P2/P3 tickets with multiple reassignments or skill mismatches have higher SLA breach rates.

### **Quantifying Impact**
- **Average Delay per Reassignment:** If a ticket is reassigned twice, and each reassignment adds 15 minutes, total added time = 30 minutes.
- **SLA Breach Attribution:**
  - Use decision mining to see if skill mismatches (e.g., assigning "Networking-Firewall" to a non-specialist) correlate with breaches.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes**
- **Deficient Assignment Rules:**
  - Pure round-robin ignores agent skills, workload, and ticket priority.
- **Inaccurate Skill Profiles:**
  - Agent skills may not be updated, leading to mismatches.
- **Poor Initial Ticket Categorization:**
  - If required skills are mislabeled, the wrong agents get assigned.
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
  - Dispatchers assign tickets without knowing agent availability.
- **L1 Agent Limitations:**
  - Excessive escalation due to insufficient training or empowerment.

### **Process Mining for Root Cause Analysis**
- **Variant Analysis:**
  - Compare tickets resolved quickly (L1) vs. those with multiple reassignments.
  - Identify common factors (e.g., always reassigns to L2 if skill is "Security-IAM").
- **Decision Mining:**
  - Analyze assignment decisions based on ticket attributes (priority, category, skill) to find irrational patterns (e.g., P3 tickets assigned to specialists when L1 could handle them).

## **4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

### **Proposed Optimization Strategies**

#### **1. Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting**
- **Problem:** Current round-robin assignment ignores agent skills.
- **Solution:**
  - Assign tickets based on the closest skill match (e.g., "App-CRM"  Agent with "App-CRM" or "App-ERP" experience).
  - Weight assignments by proficiency level (e.g., give preference to agents with higher proficiency in required skills).
- **Data Needed:**
  - Agent skill profiles with proficiency levels.
  - Historical success rates for skill-ticket matches.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Fewer reassignments, better first-call resolution.

#### **2. Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**
- **Problem:** Uneven workload distribution leads to bottlenecks.
- **Solution:**
  - Assign tickets to the least busy agent with the required skill.
  - Use real-time queue monitoring to prevent overloading.
- **Data Needed:**
  - Current agent workload (number of active tickets, time spent).
  - Priority-based thresholds (e.g., P1 tickets take precedence).
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Balanced workload, reduced delays.

#### **3. Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Characteristics**
- **Problem:** Initial categorization errors lead to mismatches.
- **Solution:**
  - Use NLP on ticket descriptions to predict required skills (e.g., keywords like "CRM" or "firewall").
  - Assign proactively based on historical patterns (e.g., "Network" tickets often require "Networking-Firewall").
- **Data Needed:**
  - Ticket descriptions, past assignments, and outcomes.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Faster, more accurate assignments, fewer reassignments.

## **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

### **Business Process Simulation**
- **Purpose:** Test proposed strategies before full implementation.
- **Approach:**
  - Use historical log data to simulate assignment strategies (e.g., skill-based routing).
  - Compare against baseline performance (current process).
  - Predict impact on resolution time, SLA compliance, and workload balance.

### **Post-Implementation Monitoring**
- **Key KPIs to Track:**
  - **Resource Utilization:** Agent workload distribution, idle time.
  - **Assignment Accuracy:** % of tickets assigned to agents with matching skills.
  - **Escalation Rates:** % of tickets escalated from L1 to L2/L3.
  - **Reassignment Frequency:** Average reassignments per ticket.
  - **SLA Compliance:** % of P2/P3 tickets resolved within target time.
- **Process Mining Dashboard:**
  - Visualize flow patterns, bottlenecks, and skill utilization.
  - Alerts for unusual spikes in reassignment or SLA breaches.
