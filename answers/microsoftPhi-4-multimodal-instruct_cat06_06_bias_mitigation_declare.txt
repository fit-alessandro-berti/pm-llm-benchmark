Here is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new bias-mitigating constraints added:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Coexistence for fairness
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Mitigation check before decisions
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Coexistence for fairness
        "FinalDecision": {"CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Prevent direct succession from race check to decision
    },
    "succession": {},
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

**Rationale:**

- **Coexistence Constraint:** By ensuring that a `ManualReview` activity coexists with a decision step for a minority applicant, we can prevent decisions from being made without proper scrutiny, thus promoting fairness.

- **Response Constraint:** A `BiasMitigationCheck` must occur before any decision step and must coexist with a `ManualReview`. This two-pronged approach ensures that decisions are not made based on sensitive attributes and that a manual check is performed for fairness.

- **Succession Constraint:** Preventing a direct succession from a race check to a decision event (`CheckApplicantRace`:Fail (to `Reject`) ensures that a race check can be part of a more complex process that involves mitigation checks before making a final decision. This prevents automated and direct system responses based on race without further checks.
