Here is the comprehensive event log derived from the provided tables, with each activity mapped to its respective timestamp and linked via the `order_id`. I have included one event per activity (e.g., "Items Picked" is aggregated into a single event per order, rather than one per item, for simplicity). If multiple shipments or invoices/payments exist for an order, I have included all corresponding events.

### Assumptions:
1. The "Items Picked" event is represented by the earliest `item_picking_date` for the order (or the latest if that better reflects the process). Alternatively, a separate event could be created for each item, but this would lead to redundant activity names.
2. Deliveries with multiple shipments are represented by separate "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events (one per shipment).
3. Invoices with multiple installments (e.g., for `order_id 1002`) are represented by multiple "Invoice Issued" events.
4. Payments are linked directly to the invoice they reference.

### Notes:
1. For `order_id 1004`, there is no delivery, invoice, or payment data in the provided tables. I have included placeholder rows with "(No data)" to indicate missing events. In practice, you might exclude these if the process is incomplete or treat them as open cases.
2. The "Resource/Actor" column uses the ID from the source tables (e.g., `WH-001` for warehouse staff). If you prefer names, you can map these using the `Resources` table (e.g., `WH-001` = David Lin, Warehouse Staff).
3. Timestamps are in chronological order within each case (order).
