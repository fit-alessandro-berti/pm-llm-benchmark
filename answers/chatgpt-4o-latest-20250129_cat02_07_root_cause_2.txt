### **Analysis of Performance Issues in Insurance Claims Processing**  

#### **1. Identifying Cases with Longer Durations**  
To determine which cases are taking significantly longer, we calculate the total time from **"Submit Claim"** to **"Close Claim"** for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time            | End Time              | Total Duration  |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30     | **1.5 hours**  |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00     | **26 hours**   |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30     | **48.5 hours** |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45     | **1.42 hours** |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30     | **77 hours**   |

### **Key Cases with Extended Durations**
- **Case 2005 (77 hours)**
- **Case 2003 (48.5 hours)**
- **Case 2002 (26 hours)**  
These cases took significantly longer than the others (Cases 2001 & 2004 finished in under 2 hours).

#### **2. Identifying Root Causes**
Now, we analyze how different attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity) contribute to delays.

##### **A. Complexity Level and Request for Additional Documents**  
- **Case 2003 & 2005 (High Complexity) had multiple requests for additional documents.**  
  - **Case 2003:** Requested additional documents twice, delaying approval by a full day.  
  - **Case 2005:** Had **three separate requests** for additional documents over multiple days.  
  - **Case 2002 (Medium Complexity)** also had a request for additional documents, but only once.  

ðŸ’¡ **Conclusion:** High-complexity cases tend to involve multiple document requests, leading to longer processing times.  

---

##### **B. Assigned Resource and Processing Bottlenecks**
1. **Claims handled by Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) take longer.**  
   - Case 2005 (77 hours) and Case 2002 (26 hours) both had **Adjuster_Lisa**, who requested multiple additional documents.  
   - Other adjusters (Mike in Region A) also requested documents, but their delays were shorter.  
   
2. **Manager_Bill (Approval Delays in High-Complexity Cases)**  
   - In Case 2003, **Manager_Bill** took nearly **a full day to approve** the claim after documentation was provided.  
   - In Case 2005, he took even longer (**more than a day**).  
   - By contrast, **Manager_Ann** approved claims much faster (within an hour in Cases 2001, 2002, and 2004).  

ðŸ’¡ **Conclusion:**  
- **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) tends to request multiple additional documents, leading to delays.**  
- **Manager_Bill takes longer to approve high-complexity cases compared to Manager_Ann.**  

---

##### **C. Geographic Region Differences (A vs. B)**
| Region | Avg. Case Duration | Cases Exceeding 24 Hours |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------|
| A      | ~24 hours       | 1 (Case 2003)        |
| B      | ~51.5 hours     | 2 (Cases 2002 & 2005) |

- **Region B cases tend to take significantly longer than Region A cases.**  
- Region B also has Adjuster_Lisa, who frequently requests additional documents, contributing to longer durations.

ðŸ’¡ **Conclusion:**  
- **Region B generally experiences longer processing times** due to multiple document requests and delays in claim approval.  
- **Resource inefficiencies (Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Bill) contribute to delays in Region B.**

#### **3. Proposed Solutions to Mitigate Delays**
âœ… **Streamline Document Request Process:**  
- Implement stricter **guidelines for when additional documents should be requested** to avoid unnecessary delays, especially in high-complexity cases.  

âœ… **Improve Adjuster Performance (Training & Workload Balancing):**  
- Provide **training to Adjuster_Lisa** to improve efficiency in assessing whether additional documents are truly needed.  
- Consider redistributing cases more evenly between adjusters in Region A and Region B.  

âœ… **Address Approval Delays by Manager_Bill:**  
- Investigate **why Manager_Bill takes significantly longer** than Manager_Ann to approve claims.  
- Implement **a service-level agreement (SLA)** for claim approvals to reduce unnecessary delays.  

âœ… **Optimize Region B Operations:**  
- Identify **operational bottlenecks** in Region B and consider process automation for repetitive tasks.

### **Final Takeaways**
ðŸš¨ **Biggest Issues:**  
- **High-complexity claims (multiple document requests)**  
- **Delays from Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) and Manager_Bill**  
- **Region B's overall longer case durations**  

ðŸ”§ **Recommendations:**  
- Reduce **unnecessary document requests**  
- Improve **adjuster efficiency and workload balancing**  
- Set **clear approval SLAs for managers**  
- Investigate **regional differences and optimize Region B processes**  

These steps will help reduce claim processing time and improve efficiency across the board! ðŸš€
