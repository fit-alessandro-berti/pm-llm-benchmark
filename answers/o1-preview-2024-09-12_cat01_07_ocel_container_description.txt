  - **Rescheduling Activities:** Point to the dynamic nature of logistics, where adjustments are necessary to handle exceptions or changes in schedules.

### **Conclusion:**

The underlying process is a complex logistics and shipping operation that manages customer orders from initiation to delivery. It involves coordinating multiple resources—goods (handling units), containers, trucks, vehicles, and forklifts—to transport goods efficiently. The process handles ordering and transporting empty containers, loading goods onto trucks, processing containers at a terminal, and finally loading them onto vehicles for departure. Rescheduling mechanisms are in place to manage operational uncertainties, ensuring that customer orders are fulfilled despite potential delays or changes.
