Here’s a concise analysis of delays and their likely causes based on the event log.

1) Cases with significantly longer total resolution times
- Case 101: 2024-03-01 08:00 to 10:15 — about 2h15m (fast/benchmark)
- Case 103: 08:10 to 09:30 — about 1h20m (fastest)
- Case 104: 08:20 to 2024-03-02 08:30 — about 24h10m (significantly longer)
- Case 102: 08:05 to 2024-03-02 09:15 — about 25h10m (significantly longer)
- Case 105: 08:25 to 2024-03-03 09:30 — about 49h05m (very long)

Outliers: Cases 102, 104, 105 (especially 105).

2) Likely root causes and where they occur
a) Escalations correlate with long durations
- Case 102: Escalated at 11:30 on Day 1; resolved next day at 09:00.
- Case 105: Escalated at 10:00 on Day 1; second “Investigate Issue” by Level-2 only at Day 2 14:00; resolved Day 3 09:00.
Impact: Escalations introduce handoff and queue delays, often overnight/weekend spillover.

b) Long waits before or between investigation and resolution
- Case 104: Investigate starts only at 13:00 (after assignment at 09:30), then no progress until next day 08:00 resolve. Suggests queueing/availability gaps.
- Case 102: Big gap from escalation (11:30) to investigation (14:00), then another large gap to next-day resolution (09:00).
- Case 105: After escalation (10:00 Day 1), Level-2 investigation doesn’t start until 14:00 Day 2 (~28 hours).

c) Late start of initial investigation
- Case 104: Receive 08:20  Investigate 13:00 (4h40m lag), far slower than Cases 101/103 (~30–45m lag).
Impact: Delayed investigation extends total cycle even without escalation.

d) Multiple or repeated investigation steps at different levels
- Case 105: Investigate at L1, then escalate, then another Level-2 investigation a day later. Redundant work and re-queueing inflate lead time.

3) How these factors increase cycle time and recommendations
How delays arise
- Handoffs and escalation queues: Moving from L1 to L2 introduces wait time due to specialist backlog and prioritization, often causing overnight carryover.
- Scheduling/availability gaps: Long stretches between “Assign” and “Investigate” indicate agents aren’t picking up promptly, likely due to workload peaks or shift changes.
- Rework: Initial L1 investigation before escalation can be time-consuming but inconclusive, then the case waits again for L2 to restart investigation.

Recommendations
1) Tighten escalation criteria and routing
- Introduce early detection rules to escalate sooner when certain signals appear (keywords, category, customer tier). This reduces wasted L1 effort and brings L2 in earlier.
- Auto-route specific categories directly to L2.

2) Service-level targets for pickup times
- Set SLAs for “Assign  Investigate” (e.g., within 60 minutes). Monitor and alert on breaches to prevent multi-hour idle times like in Case 104.

3) Prioritize escalated tickets in L2 queue
- Dedicated capacity or fast-track lane for escalations to avoid day-crossing delays (as in Cases 102 and 105).

4) Improve shift handover coverage
- Ensure coverage around lunch/shift changes to avoid long mid-day stalls and day-end spillover. Consider partial overlap shifts for L2.

5) Knowledge base and L1 enablement
- Equip L1 with better diagnostics or decision trees to reduce unnecessary back-and-forth and speed correct escalations.

6) Track and report key wait-time metrics
- Measure and visualize:
  - Receive  Investigate
  - Assign  Investigate
  - Escalate  L2 Investigate
  - L2 Investigate  Resolve
Focus on outliers and recurrent categories to target staffing and training.

Summary
- Slow cases are 102, 104, 105; the longest is 105.
- Main drivers: escalations with large queues, delayed start of investigation after assignment, and rework across levels.
- Address via earlier and smarter escalations, SLA-backed pickup times, L2 prioritization and coverage, and better L1 enablement with continuous monitoring of idle intervals.
