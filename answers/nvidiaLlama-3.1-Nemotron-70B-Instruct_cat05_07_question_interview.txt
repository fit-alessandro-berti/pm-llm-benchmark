Here are targeted, open-ended questions to clarify and improve understanding of the property onboarding process:

**Missing Details & Decision Criteria**

1. Can you elaborate on the typical range of "special conditions or policies" discussed during the introductory call between the property manager and landlord? How are these documented and followed up on?
2. What specific factors contribute to a property manager's "track record in dealing with landlords who have unique requirements"? How is this performance metric measured?
3. How does the company's pricing strategy (mentioned in the financial analyst's review) balance profitability targets with competitive market pricing?
4. Are there any specific, company-wide standards for "luxury units" or "student housing" that property managers must adhere to during onboarding and management?

**Roles and Responsibilities**

5. Beyond the introductory call, how frequently does the property coordinator interact with the assigned property manager, and what information is typically exchanged?
6. Can you outline the responsibilities of the leasing agent when they're involved in handling tenant screening, versus when the property manager handles it directly?
7. How does the compliance officer's review of the lease agreement integrate with the property manager's finalization of the lease? Are there scenarios where the compliance officer can halt the process?
8. What is the escalation process if the IT department identifies integration issues with the property's online listing or data entries?

**Timing and Sequencing**

9. What is the average timeframe from the initial landlord contact to the property being "activated" in the rental portal? Are there benchmarks for each stage of the process?
10. Can the marketing and inspection processes happen concurrently, or must the property pass inspection before marketing begins?
11. How much time typically elapses between tenant selection and the move-in date? What factors influence this duration?
12. Are there seasonal fluctuations in the volume of new properties being onboarded, and if so, how does the company adapt its resources?

**Exceptions and Communication**

13. How are custom lease clauses, requested by landlords, reviewed and approved? Is there a legal review process involved?
14. Can you walk me through an example of how a property requiring special insurance (e.g., flood insurance) is handled differently from standard properties?
15. How do regional offices communicate with each other when dealing with properties that span multiple regions or have unique, cross-regional requirements?
16. Are there established thresholds (e.g., property value, number of units) that dictate when more senior management or specialized teams (e.g., legal, finance) become involved in the onboarding process?
17. In cases where external stakeholders (e.g., contractors for repairs) are involved, how does the company ensure timely communication and progress updates to the landlord and internal teams?
