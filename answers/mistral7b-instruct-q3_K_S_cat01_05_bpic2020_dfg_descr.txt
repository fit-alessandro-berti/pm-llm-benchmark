It appears that the data provided represents a process flow diagram for a business application, possibly related to finance or accounting. The various steps in the flow indicate different actions that need to be taken by various actors in order to finalize the process.

The initial step is labeled "Declaration SUBMITTED" and involves an employee submitting some kind of financial declaration. This declaration is then approved or rejected by various actors, including the administrator, budget owner, pre-approver, supervisor, and potentially others depending on how the flow progresses.

During these steps, there are different actions that can be taken based on the status of the declaration. For example, if it is initially submitted but not approved or rejected by the appropriate actors, it may be put "on hold" until it receives final approval or rejection. Similarly, if the declaration is rejected, it may need to be resubmitted or corrected before it can proceed further in the process.

The flow diagram also indicates several potential points of interaction between different actors and various types of performance metrics related to the process. For example, there are multiple instances where a declaration may be "FINAL_APPROVED" by a supervisor or other actor, and these events may have associated performance metrics such as frequency and performance rate.

Overall, this data appears to represent a complex process involving various actors and interactions between them in order to complete an important financial transaction or business task.
