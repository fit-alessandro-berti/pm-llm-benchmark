## **Step 1: Analyzing Resolution Times**

To identify cases with significantly longer resolution times, I calculate the duration from receiving the ticket to closing it.

**Case 101:**

* **Receive Ticket:** 2024-03-01 08:00
* **Close Ticket:** 2024-03-01 10:15
* **Resolution Time:** 2 hours and 15 minutes

**Case 102:**

* **Receive Ticket:** 2024-03-01 08:05
* **Close Ticket:** 2024-03-02 09:15
* **Resolution Time:** 1 day and 1 hour and 10 minutes

**Case 103:**

* **Receive Ticket:** 2024-03-01 08:10
* **Close Ticket:** 2024-03-01 09:30
* **Resolution Time:** 1 hour and 20 minutes

**Case 104:**

* **Receive Ticket:** 2024-03-01 08:20
* **Close Ticket:** 2024-03-02 08:30
* **Resolution Time:** 23 hours and 10 minutes

**Case 105:**

* **Receive Ticket:** 2024-03-01 08:25
* **Close Ticket:** 2024-03-03 09:30
* **Resolution Time:** 2 days and 1 hour and 5 minutes

## **Step 2: Identifying Performance Issues**

* **Case 102:** 1 day, 1 hour, and 10 minutes
* **Case 104:** 23 hours and 10 minutes
* **Case 105:** 2 days and 1 hour and 5 minutes

These cases have notably longer resolution times compared to Case 101 and Case 103. Therefore, **Case 102, Case 104, and Case 105** are identified as having significantly longer resolution times.

## **Step 3: Determining Potential Root Causes**

### Case 102:

* The ticket was escalated to **Level-2 Agent** at 11:30 on 2024-03-01.
* The investigation started immediately after escalation at 14:00 on 2024-03-01, indicating no significant delays before escalation.

### Case 104:

* The ticket was resolved and closed quickly after the escalation. However, there's a 3.5-hour gap between **Investigate Issue** and **Resolve Ticket**.

### Case 105:

* The ticket was escalated to **Level-2 Agent** at 10:00 on 2024-03-01, and there was a nearly **29-hour delay** before resolving the ticket on 2024-03-03 at 09:00.

## **Step 4: Explaining the Factors Leading to Increased Cycle Times**

### Escalations:

* Escalations to **Level-2 Agent** (Case 102 and Case 105) seem to introduce significant delays, suggesting that either the specialized team is not prompt in handling escalated tickets or that there are inefficiencies in the escalation process.

### Long Waiting Times Between Activities:

* **Case 105** had a long delay after escalation.
* **Case 104** experienced a significant delay during investigation, possibly indicating resource constraints or complexity in resolving the issue.

## **Step 5: Recommendations**

* **Streamline Escalation Processes:** Implementing service level agreements (SLAs) for escalated cases could help ensure quicker responses from specialized teams.
* **Prioritize Investigation Efficiency:** Identify and train support agents to handle investigations more swiftly, reducing bottlenecks.
* **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Ensure that resources are adequately distributed during peak hours to avoid delays in ticket processing and resolution.

## **Step 6: Final Analysis and Insights**

- Cases **102, 104, and 105** have significantly longer resolution times compared to Case 101 and Case 103.
- The presence of escalations and long waiting times between activities, such as investigation and resolution, seem to be major contributing factors.
- Streamlining escalation procedures and optimizing resource allocation could significantly reduce cycle times.

## **Conclusion**

Cases 102, 104, and 105 exhibit longer resolution times due to escalations and delays in investigation or resolution steps. By focusing on streamlining escalations and optimizing resource allocation, support teams can reduce cycle times and improve overall efficiency.
