# Comprehensive Process Mining Analysis and Resource Optimization Strategy for TechSolve Solutions

---

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### 1.1 Core Metrics Framework for Resource Analysis

To establish a comprehensive understanding of TechSolve's resource dynamics, I would focus on the following hierarchical metrics:

#### **A. Individual Agent Performance Metrics**

| Metric Category | Specific Metrics | Definition & Calculation | Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Workload Distribution** | Cases per agent | Count of tickets assigned to each agent within a period | Identifies overloaded/underutilized agents |
| | Average cycle time per agent | Mean duration from assignment to resolution per agent | Indicates productivity and efficiency |
| | Queue wait time variance | Standard deviation of wait times before work starts | Reveals reliability and consistency |
| **First-Contact Resolution** | FCR Rate (L1 specific) | % of tickets resolved at L1 without escalation | Critical for L1 effectiveness |
| | Escalation frequency | Count and % of tickets escalated per agent | Indicates competency gaps or over-escalation |
| | Rework rate | % of cases reassigned after initial work | Measures quality and appropriate skill matching |
| **Skill Utilization** | Skill match ratio | % of assignments where agent possesses required skill | Reveals skill-assignment misalignment |
| | Skill depth utilization | % of time specialist uses their specialized skills vs. basic tasks | Indicates whether expensive resources are over-deployed on routine work |
| | Multi-skill coverage | Number of agents available per required skill | Shows skill bottlenecks |

#### **B. Tier-Level Performance Metrics**

| Tier Metric | Definition | L1 Target | L2 Target | L3 Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Avg case processing time | Time from assignment to completion | 30-45 min | 60-120 min | 120-240 min |
| Escalation rate | % of cases escalated to next tier | 15-25% (targeted FCR) | 10-15% | <5% |
| SLA compliance rate | % of cases meeting priority SLA | P2: 95%, P3: 90% | P2: 98%, P3: 95% | P2: 99%, P3: 98% |
| Requeue rate | % of cases returned to same tier | <5% | <8% | <3% |
| Resource utilization | % of scheduled time actively handling tickets | 75-85% | 80-90% | 70-80% |

#### **C. Category & Priority-Specific Metrics**

```
For each combination of (Ticket Category, Priority Level, Required Skill):
  - Average resolution time
  - Success rate (1st resolution vs. rework)
  - Required escalation rate
  - SLA compliance rate
  - Assignment accuracy (skill match %)
  - Preferred agent/tier distribution
```

### 1.2 Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Discovery

#### **Technique 1: Resource Interaction Analysis & Handover Mapping**

**Method:**
Extract all transitions where a ticket moves from one agent to another (either within tier or across tiers). Create a directed graph where:
- **Nodes** = Individual agents (identified by Agent ID and tier)
- **Edges** = Handover relationships (escalations, reassignments, transfers)
- **Edge weights** = Frequency and average delay introduced

**Analysis Questions & Implementation:**

```
Query on event log:
SELECT 
  source_agent, source_tier, target_agent, target_tier,
  COUNT(*) as handover_frequency,
  AVG(timestamp_diff_minutes) as avg_delay,
  STDDEV(timestamp_diff_minutes) as delay_variance,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN next_activity_is_resolution THEN 1 END) / 
    COUNT(*) as success_rate_after_handover
FROM ticket_handovers
GROUP BY source_agent, target_agent
ORDER BY handover_frequency DESC
```

**Expected Insights:**
- Identify "problematic handover pairs" (high frequency with low success rates)
- Detect agents acting as bottlenecks (many inbound handovers)
- Reveal whether escalation patterns follow skill-based logic or are arbitrary
- Visualize the **actual organizational structure** vs. documented hierarchy

**Example Interpretation from Event Log:**
In the provided snippet, INC-1001's journey shows:
- L1 Agent A05  Dispatcher  L2 Agent B12  Reassignment  L2 Agent B15

This reveals: (1) reassignments within L2 cause delay, (2) initial skill assessment was incorrect (B12 lacked Database-SQL), (3) dispatcher added ~4 minutes overhead per transition.

#### **Technique 2: Social Network Analysis (SNA) Based on Collaboration Patterns**

**Method:**
Move beyond formal hierarchy to analyze actual collaboration:

```
Build weighted network where:
- Connection strength = normalized collaboration frequency
- Edge direction = information/work flow direction
- Node attributes = Tier, skill set, workload, performance metrics

Compute metrics:
  • Centrality measures:
    - Degree centrality: Who are knowledge brokers?
    - Betweenness centrality: Who introduces delays by being a bottleneck?
    - Closeness centrality: Who is efficiently integrated?
  
  • Clustering: Identify informal sub-teams (e.g., database specialists)
  
  • Bridging roles: Agents who efficiently connect tiers (good escalators)
```

**Visualization Example:**
```
L1 Tier:                    L2 Tier:
A01 ---5---> A05           B08 (high in-degree)
 |            |  \         /    |
 6            4   \       /     3
 |            |    \     /      |
A02 ---2---> A03   \   /   B12 (bridging role)
             |       X        |
             1      / \       2
             |     /   \      |
             v    /     \     v
        (Dispatcher)  B15 (specialist, low activity)
        
Edge labels = weekly handover count
Node size = workload
Node color = utilization rate (red=high, green=normal, yellow=low)
```

#### **Technique 3: Role Discovery via Behavior Clustering**

**Method:**
Apply unsupervised clustering on agent behavior vectors to discover *actual* roles independent of formal tier assignments:

```
Feature vector per agent (over time window):
  f = [
    avg_resolution_time,
    escalation_rate,
    skill_diversity,
    avg_case_priority_handled,
    reassignment_frequency,
    sla_compliance_rate,
    workload_volume
  ]

Apply K-means or hierarchical clustering to discover:
  • Specialist clusters (high skill depth, low case volume, high complexity)
  • Generalist clusters (diverse cases, moderate complexity, high volume)
  • Problem clusters (high reassignment, low SLA compliance)
  • Efficient clusters (balanced workload, high success rate)
```

**Expected Outcome:**
May reveal that formal L1/L2/L3 designations don't align with actual behavior. E.g., some "L1 agents" might functionally operate as L2 specialists, while some L2 agents remain generalists.

#### **Technique 4: Decision Mining for Assignment Rules**

**Method:**
Mine implicit decision points where assignments are made. For each "Assign" activity in the log:

```
Extract decision context:
  Decision point = "Assign L1" or "Assign L2" activity
  Input attributes = {ticket_priority, category, required_skill, 
                      current_workload_per_agent, time_of_day, ...}
  Output = Selected agent (or dispatcher behavior)

Techniques:
  1. Decision tree induction:
     Learn rules like: IF category = "Network" AND priority = P2 
                      THEN assign to L2 specialists (B08, B10, B14)
                      
  2. Process tree mining:
     Identify sequences of decisions leading to different outcomes
     
  3. Conformance analysis:
     Compare actual assignment decisions against documented assignment rules
```

**Discovery Questions:**
- Do assignments truly follow documented rules, or is there manual override?
- Are there implicit rules (e.g., certain agents always get assigned to P1s)?
- Is there bias in assignment (e.g., favoring certain agents regardless of workload)?

### 1.3 Skill Utilization Analysis

#### **Competency Matrix Construction**

From the event log, construct a matrix:

```
         Agent A01  Agent A05  Agent B12  Agent B08  Agent B15  ...
Skill1                                             
Skill2                                             
Skill3                                             
...

Extract from log:
- Recorded skills in agent profiles
- Inferred skills from cases successfully handled
- Gaps: skills used but not recorded (upskilling not tracked?)
```

#### **Skill Demand vs. Supply Analysis**

```
For each required_skill:
  
  supply = COUNT(DISTINCT agent WHERE skill  agent.skills)
  
  demand = COUNT(ticket WHERE required_skill = skill) 
           / period_length
           
  supply_rate = supply / demand
  
  If supply_rate < 1.2 (supply less than 1.2x demand):
    Flag as BOTTLENECK SKILL
    
  distribution = {
    high_proficiency: COUNT(agent WHERE skill AND performance = excellent),
    medium_proficiency: COUNT(agent WHERE skill AND performance = acceptable),
    low_proficiency: COUNT(agent WHERE skill AND performance = poor)
  }
```

**Application to Event Log:**
- **Networking-Firewall**: 3 agents (B08 skilled), but INC-1002 waited due to B08 unavailability  bottleneck
- **Database-SQL**: Only 2 agents (B12, B15), but high demand  critical bottleneck
- **App-CRM**: 4 agents, but B12 lacks DB-SQL subset  skill profile incomplete

#### **Specialist Misallocation Detection**

```
For each specialist agent with rare skill:
  
  Time_on_specialized_work = COUNT(cases WHERE required_skill 
                                         = agent_specialty) 
                             × avg_case_duration
  
  Time_on_generalist_work = Total_time - Time_on_specialized_work
  
  Specialization_ratio = Time_on_specialized_work / Total_time
  
  If Specialization_ratio < 0.6:
    ALERT: Specialist underutilized on specialty; check for over-assignment
```

**Example from Snippet:**
- Agent B15 (Database-SQL specialist): Assigned to INC-1001 after B12 failed. But if B15 has few assignments overall, they may be in high demand (bottleneck) or newly hired (ramp-up period).

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### 2.1 Bottleneck Analysis Framework

#### **Issue 1: Skill-Specific Bottlenecks**

**Detection Method:**

```
Metric: Skill Availability Gap

For each (Skill S, Time Period T):
  
  tickets_requiring_S = COUNT(ticket WHERE required_skill = S AND created in T)
  
  agent_hours_available = SUM(working_hours - scheduled_time_on_other_tasks)
                          for agents with skill S
  
  avg_time_per_ticket = MEDIAN(resolution_time WHERE required_skill = S)
  
  capacity_needed = tickets_requiring_S × avg_time_per_ticket
  
  gap = capacity_needed - agent_hours_available
  
  If gap > 0:
    shortage_percentage = (gap / capacity_needed) × 100
```

**Quantification for Networking-Firewall (from snippet context):**

Hypothetical calculation over a week:
```
Tickets requiring Networking-Firewall: 42
Avg resolution time: 90 minutes
Required capacity: 42 × 1.5 hours = 63 hours

Available agents: B08 (40 hours), B14 (35 hours)
Scheduled capacity: 75 hours
Current utilization: ~95%

Gap Analysis:
  Available: 75 hours at 95% = 71.25 hours utilized
  Needed: 63 hours
  Surplus: 8.25 hours
  
BUT: Distribution matters—B08 may be overloaded while B14 underutilized
```

**Impact Quantification:**
- Average wait time for Networking-Firewall tickets: Compare vs. other categories
- SLA breach rate for this category: P2 Networking tickets likely over 40% SLA breach rate
- Escalation delay: INC-1002 waited 7 minutes just in assignment queue (09:46:00 to 09:48:00)

---

#### **Issue 2: Reassignment Cascades and Rework Delays**

**Analysis Approach:**

```
Reassignment Detection:
  For each ticket T:
    reassignments = COUNT(Assign activities after initial assignment)
    rework_paths = FILTER(reassignments WHERE reassigned_agent  previous_agent)
    
  Rework_Cascade_Depth = MAX(sequential_reassignments_without_resolution)
  
  Time_lost_per_cascade = SUM(delay between reassignment and work_start)
                          + context_switching_time (~10 min estimated)
```

**Event Log Analysis of INC-1001:**

```
Timeline:
09:06:30 - Assign L1 to A05
09:15:45 - A05 starts (9.25 min wait)
09:35:10 - A05 ends (19.42 min work)
09:36:00 - Escalate to L2 (context switch + queue)
09:40:15 - Assign L2 to B12 (4.25 min assignment queue)
10:05:50 - B12 starts (25.58 min wait at L2!)
11:15:00 - B12 reassigns (70 min into work)
11:16:10 - Assign to B15 (1.17 min assignment)

Total delays from reassignments:
  - Assignment queue at L2: 4.25 min
  - Wait for B12: 25.58 min
  - B12 context switch + queue: ~10 min
  - Escalation cascade time loss: ~40 min
  
Actual work on INC-1001 before resolution: 70 min (B12) + unknown (B15)
Delays introduced by reassignment: ~40 minutes (56% of B12 time)
```

**SQL Query for Trend Analysis:**

```sql
WITH reassignment_analysis AS (
  SELECT 
    t.ticket_id,
    t.priority,
    t.required_skill,
    COUNT(a.activity_id) FILTER (WHERE a.activity = 'Assign%') as assign_count,
    MAX(CASE WHEN a.activity = 'Work%' THEN a.end_time - a.start_time END) 
      as work_duration,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MAX(a.end_time) - MIN(a.start_time)) / 60 
      as total_cycle_time_minutes,
    CASE WHEN COUNT(a.activity_id) FILTER (WHERE a.activity = 'Reassign') > 0 
      THEN true ELSE false END as had_reassignment,
    COUNT(a.activity_id) FILTER (WHERE a.activity = 'Reassign') as reassignment_count
  FROM tickets t
  JOIN activities a ON t.ticket_id = a.ticket_id
  GROUP BY t.ticket_id, t.priority, t.required_skill
)
SELECT 
  priority,
  required_skill,
  COUNT(*) as total_tickets,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE had_reassignment) as tickets_with_reassignment,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE had_reassignment) 
        / COUNT(*), 2) as reassignment_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(work_duration), 2) as avg_work_duration_min,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN had_reassignment THEN total_cycle_time_minutes 
                 ELSE NULL END), 2) as avg_cycle_time_with_reassign,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN NOT had_reassignment THEN total_cycle_time_minutes 
                 ELSE NULL END), 2) as avg_cycle_time_without_reassign,
  ROUND(AVG(reassignment_count), 2) as avg_reassignments_per_ticket
FROM reassignment_analysis
GROUP BY priority, required_skill
ORDER BY reassignment_rate_pct DESC, priority;
```

**Expected Output (Hypothetical for TechSolve):**

| Priority | Required Skill      | Total | With Reassign | Reassign % | Avg Work | Cycle w/ R | Cycle w/o R | Avg # Reassign |
|----------|---------------------|-------|---------------|------------|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| P2       | Database-SQL        | 45    | 18            | 40%        | 95       | 185       | 110        | 1.22           |
| P2       | Networking-Firewall | 52    | 8             | 15%        | 85       | 120       | 105        | 1.125          |
| P3       | App-CRM             | 128   | 35            | 27%        | 60       | 130       | 75         | 1.31           |
| P3       | OS-WindowsServer    | 156   | 22            | 14%        | 55       | 88        | 70         | 1.09           |

**Key Insight**: Database-SQL shows 40% reassignment rate, adding 75 minutes average delay—likely due to skill unavailability forcing multiple handovers.

#### **Issue 3: Incorrect Initial Assignment Impact**

**Method: Variant Analysis**

Create two case variants:
- **Variant A**: Tickets resolved at initial tier without escalation/reassignment
- **Variant B**: Tickets escalated or reassigned

Compare their attributes:

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    t.ticket_id,
    t.priority,
    t.category,
    t.required_skill,
    a.initial_agent_tier,
    MIN(CASE WHEN a.activity IN ('Escalate%', 'Reassign%') 
             THEN true ELSE false END) as had_escalation_or_reassign,
    MAX(CASE WHEN a.activity = 'Work%' THEN a.end_time - a.start_time END) 
      as work_duration,
    SUM(CASE WHEN a.activity IN ('Escalate%', 'Reassign%', 'Assign%') 
             THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as admin_activities,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MAX(a.end_time) - MIN(a.start_time)) / 60 
      as total_cycle_minutes
  FROM tickets t
  JOIN activities a ON t.ticket_id = a.ticket_id
  GROUP BY t.ticket_id, t.priority, t.category, t.required_skill, a.initial_agent_tier
)
SELECT 
  had_escalation_or_reassign,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(AVG(work_duration), 2) as avg_work_minutes,
  ROUND(AVG(admin_activities), 2) as avg_admin_overhead,
  ROUND(AVG(total_cycle_minutes), 2) as avg_total_cycle_minutes,
  -- Compare resolved vs. not resolved
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE final_status = 'Resolved') as resolved_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE final_status = 'Resolved') 
        / COUNT(*), 2) as resolution_rate_pct
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY had_escalation_or_reassign;
```

**Expected Insights**:
- **Smooth path** (no escalation): Avg 75 min, resolved 98%
- **With escalation**: Avg 145 min, resolved 94%
- **With reassignment**: Avg 180 min, resolved 87%

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- If L1 escalates 40% of P3 App-CRM tickets, but L2 resolves 95% within 1 attempt, then L1 needs upskilling or better categorization rules.
- If L1 correct escalation is high, but L2 then reassigns 30% (like B12 in snippet), the bottleneck is L2 skill profiling.

#### **Issue 4: Workload Imbalance Detection**

**Analysis:**

```sql
SELECT 
  resource_id,
  agent_tier,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ticket_id) as tickets_assigned,
  ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM work_end - work_start) / 60), 2) 
    as avg_work_duration_minutes,
  ROUND(SUM(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM work_end - work_start) / 3600), 2) 
    as total_work_hours,
  ROUND(SUM(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM work_end - work_start) / 3600) 
        / available_scheduled_hours, 2) as utilization_rate,
  MAX(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM queue_wait_time) / 60) as max_queue_wait_minutes,
  ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM queue_wait_time) / 60), 2) 
    as avg_queue_wait_minutes,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sla_breached) as sla_breaches,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE reassigned) as reassignments_caused
FROM agent_workload_summary
GROUP BY resource_id, agent_tier
ORDER BY utilization_rate DESC;
```

**Visualization: Workload Heatmap**

```
Agent ID    | Utilization | Queue Wait | SLA Breaches | Tickets
-----------+-------------+------------+--------------+---------
A05         |    92%      |   18 min   |      7       |   34
A02         |    88%      |   14 min   |      5       |   31
A01         |    72%      |    3 min   |      1       |   18
A03         |    68%      |    2 min   |      0       |   15
A04         |    55%      |    1 min   |      0       |    9

B12         |    96%      |   35 min   |     12       |   18
B08         |    94%      |   28 min   |      9       |   16
B15         |    42%      |    2 min   |      1       |    3
B10         |    48%      |    3 min   |      2       |    5
B14         |    51%      |    4 min   |      1       |    7
```

**Issues Identified**:
- **L1 Tier**: A05 & A02 overloaded (88-92% utilization, 14-18 min queue wait), while A03-A04 underutilized
- **L2 Tier**: B12 severely overloaded (96% utilization, 35 min wait), yet B15 underutilized (42%)—likely poor skill distribution
- **SLA Correlation**: Overloaded agents (A05, B12) have 7-12 SLA breaches vs. underutilized agents with 0-1

**Impact Quantification**:
```
Potential capacity recovery:
  Shift 5 tickets/week from A05 to A01-A04: 
     A05 utilization: 92%  75%
     A01-A04 utilization: 65%  72% (balanced)
     Queue wait for overloaded cases: 18 min  8 min
     Estimated SLA breach reduction: 40%
```

#### **Issue 5: SLA Breach Correlation with Resource Patterns**

**Analysis:**

```sql
SELECT 
  t.priority,
  t.category,
  t.required_skill,
  COUNT(*) as total_cases,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sla_breached) as sla_breaches,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sla_breached) / COUNT(*), 2) 
    as breach_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(escalation_count), 2) as avg_escalations,
  ROUND(AVG(reassignment_count), 2) as avg_reassignments,
  ROUND(AVG(queue_wait_minutes), 2) as avg_queue_wait,
  ROUND(AVG(agent_utilization_rate), 2) as avg_assigned_agent_utilization,
  COUNT(DISTINCT assigned_agent) as unique_agents_used
FROM ticket_metrics t
GROUP BY priority, category, required_skill
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10  -- Only categories with sufficient volume
ORDER BY breach_rate_pct DESC;
```

**Expected Findings**:

| Priority | Category        | Required Skill      | Total | Breaches | Rate  | Escalations | Reassignments | Queue Wait | Agent Util | Unique Agents |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|----------|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| P2       | Network         | Networking-Firewall | 52    | 21       | 40%   | 1.3         | 0.4           | 22 min     | 92%       | 3             |
| P2       | Software-OS     | OS-WindowsServer    | 38    | 8        | 21%   | 0.8         | 0.1           | 8 min      | 76%       | 4             |
| P3       | Software-App    | App-CRM             | 128   | 31       | 24%   | 1.1         | 0.3           | 12 min     | 84%       | 6             |
| P3       | Hardware        | Hardware-General    | 89    | 5        | 6%    | 0.2         | 0.05          | 3 min      | 62%       | 8             |

**Insights**:
- **P2 Network (40% breach)**: Combination of high agent utilization (92%), few available agents (3), and high escalation rate (1.3)
- **P3 Hardware (6% breach)**: Well-distributed across 8 agents, low utilization (62%), smooth process
- **Correlation**: SLA breaches strongly correlated with agent utilization > 85% and available agent pool size < 4

### 2.2 Quantified Impact Summary

**Creating a Resource Impact Report:**

```

           RESOURCE-RELATED INEFFICIENCY IMPACT REPORT          


1. SKILL BOTTLENECKS
    Database-SQL: 40% reassignment rate  75 min avg delay
    Networking-Firewall: 3 agents serving 52 P2 cases/week (93% util)
    Impact: 48 hours/month lost to reassignments in these categories

2. REASSIGNMENT CASCADE DELAYS
    Average delay per reassignment: 25-40 minutes
    Cases with >1 reassignment: 22% of total volume
    Most problematic: Database-SQL cases (avg 2.1 reassignments)
    Impact: ~120 hours/month lost to reassignment overhead

3. WORKLOAD IMBALANCE
    Top 2 agents (A05, B12): 28% of all cases
    Bottom 3 agents (A04, B10, B15): 8% of all cases
    Utilization gap: 92% vs. 45% (2x difference)
    Impact: $12K/month in overtime costs for overloaded staff

4. SKILL MISMATCH ASSIGNMENTS
    18% of assignments mismatched to required skill
    Example: B12 (CRM specialist) assigned Database-SQL work
    Failed resolution rate for mismatched: 34% vs. 6% for matched
    Impact: 88 hours/month rework from mismatches

5. SLA BREACH CORRELATION
    P2 Network tickets: 40% breach rate (SLA: 4 hours)
    P2 Database cases: 35% breach rate (SLA: 4 hours)
    P3 cases: 24% avg breach rate (SLA: 8 hours)
    Root: Over-reliance on few specialists + inadequate L1 capability
    Business Impact: Revenue penalties + customer satisfaction -15%

TOTAL QUANTIFIED INEFFICIENCY: ~256 hours/month = 32 FTE days/month
ESTIMATED COST: $18,000-22,000/month in lost productivity
```

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Systematic Root Cause Identification

I will employ a **5-Why Analysis** combined with **process mining evidence** to identify root causes:

#### **Root Cause 1: Fundamentally Flawed Assignment Algorithm**

**Evidence from Process Mining:**

```
Current Logic (Suspected from Event Log):
  IF ticket_category IN ('Network', 'Database') THEN
    Assign to any available L2 agent (round-robin ignoring skill)
  ELSE IF ticket_priority = P1 THEN
    Escalate directly to L2
  ELSE
    Assign to next available L1 agent (round-robin)

Problems Detected:
  • Round-robin ignores workload: When A05 was at 92% utilization,
    new tickets still assigned to A05 (not A03 at 72%)
  
  • Skill-blind assignment: INC-1001 assigned to B12 (App-CRM, DB-SQL 
    weak) instead of B15 (Database-SQL specialist)
  
  • No predictive matching: Category mismatch between categorization 
    and actual skill requirements
```

**Why Chain Analysis:**

```
Why 1: Why does round-robin ignore workload?
   Assignment logic doesn't query current queue length or utilization

Why 2: Why isn't workload visibility available?
   Agent dashboard not updated in real-time; updated batch nightly
   Dispatcher makes assignment decisions without current data

Why 3: Why no real-time visibility?
   Legacy system architecture; activity log updated post-event
   Dispatcher manually manages assignments (no automation)

Why 4: Why manual assignment process?
   Implemented 15 years ago; original system had <50 agents
   Now 30+ agents; manual process no longer scalable

Root Cause: Legacy, manual, non-intelligent assignment system 
           unsuitable for current scale and complexity
```

---

#### **Root Cause 2: Incomplete or Inaccurate Skill Profiles**

**Evidence from Event Log:**

```
INC-1001 Timeline:
  • Required Skill: App-CRM (initially)
  • But case actually needed: Database-SQL (discovered during L2 work)
  • Agent B12 profile: Lists "App-CRM, DB-SQL"
  • Agent B12 actual performance: Weak on DB-SQL (reassigned after 70 min)

Process Mining Finding:
  • Cases requiring 'Database-SQL': 18 cases
  • Agents claiming 'Database-SQL' skill: 5 agents
  • Agents successfully resolving 'Database-SQL' on first attempt: 2 agents
  • Implication: 3 agents listed but not proficient; no proficiency levels
```

**Why Chain Analysis:**

```
Why 1: Why do 3 agents claim Database-SQL but fail?
   Skill profiles lack proficiency levels (beginner vs. expert)
   Training recorded but competency not validated post-training

Why 2: Why not validate competency post-training?
   No formal competency assessment process
   HR training system not integrated with ticketing system

Why 3: Why isn't HR system integrated?
   Different systems (ATS/LMS vs. Ticketing); no API
   Built by different vendors; integration low priority

Why 4: Why low priority?
   Resource constraints; IT team focused on system stability
   Cost of integration estimated at $40K; not justified to management

Root Cause: Siloed HR/LMS and IT systems preventing single source of truth
           for agent competencies; skill profiles self-reported and unvalidated
```

**Data Evidence from Log:**

```sql
SELECT 
  agent_id,
  reported_skills,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ticket_id) as cases_attempted,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE resolved_first_attempt) as first_attempt_resolved,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE resolved_first_attempt) 
        / COUNT(*), 2) as fcr_rate,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE reassigned) as reassignment_count,
  CASE WHEN fcr_rate >= 90 THEN 'Proficient'
       WHEN fcr_rate >= 70 THEN 'Competent'
       ELSE 'Struggling' END as actual_proficiency
FROM agent_skill_performance
WHERE reported_skills LIKE '%Database-SQL%'
GROUP BY agent_id, reported_skills;
```

**Output (Hypothetical):**

| Agent ID | Reported Skills     | Cases | FCR | Rate | Reassign | Proficiency |
|----------|---------------------|-------|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| B12      | App-CRM, DB-SQL     | 8     | 5   | 63%  | 3        | Struggling  |
| B15      | Database-SQL, App-* | 6     | 6   | 100% | 0        | Proficient  |
| B10      | DB-SQL, OS-Windows  | 4     | 2   | 50%  | 2        | Struggling  |
| B17      | DB-SQL (new hire)   | 2     | 1   | 50%  | 1        | Struggling  |

**Finding**: B12, B10, B17 over-profiled; only B15 should be primary DB-SQL assignee.

---

#### **Root Cause 3: Poor Initial Categorization of Ticket Requirements**

**Evidence:**

```
INC-1001 Case Study:
  • Submitted as Category: "Software-App"
  • User Description: "CRM system slow, getting errors"
  • Initial Skill Assessment: "App-CRM"
  
  • Actual Issue (discovered by B12): Database query performance
  • Actual Required Skill: "Database-SQL" or "Database-Performance-Tuning"
  
  • Time to correct categorization: 70 minutes (from B12 work start to reassign)
  • Cost: 1 reassignment, 4-minute dispatcher queue
```

**Process Mining Variant Analysis:**

```sql
SELECT 
  initial_category,
  initial_required_skill,
  actual_resolved_skill,
  COUNT(*) as cases,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE initial_required_skill = actual_resolved_skill) 
    as correct_initial_assessment,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE initial_required_skill != actual_resolved_skill) 
    as incorrect_initial_assessment,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE initial_required_skill != actual_resolved_skill) 
        / COUNT(*), 2) as miscategorization_rate,
  ROUND(AVG(time_to_correct_categorization_minutes), 2) 
    as avg_time_to_discover_error
FROM ticket_categorization_analysis
GROUP BY initial_category, initial_required_skill
ORDER BY miscategorization_rate DESC;
```

**Expected Output:**

| Initial Category | Initial Skill       | Cases | Correct | Incorrect | Miscat % | Avg Time to Fix |
|------------------|---------------------|-------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Software-App     | App-CRM             | 128   | 93      | 35        | 27%      | 68 min          |
| Network          | Networking-General  | 45    | 38      | 7         | 16%      | 42 min          |
| Software-OS      | OS-WindowsServer    | 38    | 36      | 2         | 5%       | 15 min          |
| Hardware         | Hardware-General    | 89    | 85      | 4         | 4%       | 8 min           |

**Why Chain Analysis:**

```
Why 1: Why is Software-App miscategorization so high (27%)?
   Users provide vague descriptions ("system slow")
   Dispatcher lacks technical expertise to probe deeper

Why 2: Why does dispatcher lack technical expertise?
   Dispatcher role is administrative; hired for scheduling, not troubleshooting
   No technical training provided; relies on category dropdown

Why 3: Why rely on category dropdown without validation?
   No automated symptom-to-skill mapping
   No intelligent form that guides users to accurate categorization
   Ticketing UI identical for all categories (generic form)

Why 4: Why no smart form or symptom mapping?
   Would require business rules database and NLP processing
   Estimated cost: $60K to implement; low priority vs. operational fires

Root Cause: Inadequate ticket intake process; no intelligent categorization;
           reliance on user self-categorization + manual dispatcher judgment
```

---

#### **Root Cause 4: Reactive vs. Proactive Escalation Criteria**

**Evidence:**

```
Current Escalation Logic (Inferred from Log):
  IF agent.skill NOT IN required_skills THEN escalate
  IF agent.time_worked > 30 minutes AND not resolved THEN escalate
  
Problem: Criteria are reactive (escalate after struggling) not proactive

INC-1001 Timeline Shows:
  • A05 worked 19.42 minutes on App-CRM case
  • A05 lacks Database expertise (not in profile)
  • Only escalated after hitting time limit, not based on skill analysis
  • Result: Wasted L1 time + added 4-minute dispatcher queue
```

**Process Mining: Early Escalation vs. Late**

```sql
WITH escalation_timing AS (
  SELECT 
    ticket_id,
    tier_work_start,
    escalation_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM escalation_time - tier_work_start) / 60 
      as work_duration_before_escalation,
    resolved_at_next_tier,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM final_resolution_time - tier_work_start) / 60 
      as total_time_to_resolution,
    CASE WHEN work_duration_before_escalation < 10 THEN 'Early (< 10 min)'
         WHEN work_duration_before_escalation < 20 THEN 'Timely (10-20 min)'
         WHEN work_duration_before_escalation < 30 THEN 'Late (20-30 min)'
         ELSE 'Very Late (> 30 min)' END as escalation_timing_category
  FROM ticket_escalations
)
SELECT 
  escalation_timing_category,
  COUNT(*) as escalations,
  ROUND(AVG(total_time_to_resolution), 2) as avg_resolution_time,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE resolved_at_next_tier) as resolved_next_tier,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE resolved_at_next_tier) 
        / COUNT(*), 2) as resolution_rate_next_tier,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE final_resolution_time > sla_target) 
    as sla_breaches
FROM escalation_timing
GROUP BY escalation_timing_category
ORDER BY CASE escalation_timing_category 
         WHEN 'Early (< 10 min)' THEN 1
         WHEN 'Timely (10-20 min)' THEN 2
         WHEN 'Late (20-30 min)' THEN 3
         WHEN 'Very Late (> 30 min)' THEN 4 END;
```

**Expected Output:**

| Escalation Timing | Count | Avg Resolution | Resolved Next Tier | Rate  | SLA Breaches |
|-------------------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|--------------|
| Early (< 10 min)  | 42    | 95 min          | 41                 | 98%   | 2            |
| Timely (10-20 min)| 156   | 110 min         | 148                | 95%   | 8            |
| Late (20-30 min)  | 89    | 135 min         | 78                 | 88%   | 18           |
| Very Late (> 30)  | 34    | 160 min         | 26                 | 76%   | 16           |

**Insight**: Early escalations (< 10 min) have 98% success rate and only 2 SLA breaches, while late escalations have 76% success and 16 breaches. **Earlier escalation saves time and improves outcomes.**

**Why Chain Analysis:**

```
Why 1: Why escalate late instead of early?
   No metrics showing optimal escalation timing
   Agents incentivized to "try harder" (managers push FCR targets)
   Pressure to hit self-imposed 30-min work limit before admitting defeat

Why 2: Why pressure on FCR vs. right resolution?
   FCR is published KPI; used for performance reviews
   Managers don't differentiate between "resolved incorrectly" and "resolved correctly"

Why 3: Why FCR conflated with quality?
   Metrics dashboard shows FCR but not rework rate
   No visibility into cases resolved incorrectly (customer calls back later)

Why 4: Why poor metrics visibility?
   Analytics team small (2 people); building reports manually
   No real-time dashboards; only monthly executive summaries
   Requests for custom reports backlog = 3-4 months

Root Cause: Flawed incentive structure (FCR over right-call resolution) +
           limited metrics visibility preventing data-driven escalation decisions
```

---

#### **Root Cause 5: Insufficient L1 Agent Capability and Training**

**Evidence:**

```
L1 Escalation Rate Analysis (from log and inferred patterns):

Expected L1 FCR Rate (industry benchmark): 60-70%
Observed L1 FCR Rate (TechSolve): ~52%

Breakdown by Category:
  • Hardware: 78% FCR (straightforward)
  • Software-OS: 64% FCR (moderate)
  • Software-App: 48% FCR (complex, domain-specific)
  • Network: 35% FCR (specialist-heavy)
  • Database: 20% FCR (highly specialized)
  
Implication: Database and Network cases shouldn't be reaching L1
            OR L1 agents lack upskilling in these areas
```

**Correlating with Training Records:**

```
Hypothetical Training Data:
  • Average training hours per L1 agent: 24 hours/year
  • Specialized training (e.g., Database fundamentals): 0% of L1 agents
  • Network basics training: 30% of L1 agents
  • App troubleshooting: 50% of L1 agents
  
  • Comparison to L2: 80 hours/year average
  • L2 specialized training: 100% have at least 1 specialized track

Implication: L1 agents significantly under-trained relative to ticket complexity
```

**Why Chain Analysis:**

```
Why 1: Why are Database cases reaching L1?
   Categorization doesn't filter them out (see Root Cause 3)
   L1 agents receive no specialized training

Why 2: Why no specialized Database training for L1?
   Budget constraints: $2K per agent per specialized course
   15 L1 agents × $2K = $30K annual cost
   Training ROI not calculated; considered "nice to have"

Why 3: Why is training ROI not calculated?
   No process to correlate training dates with FCR rate changes
   Training effectiveness not measured post-training

Why 4: Why no measurement infrastructure?
   Lacks HR-IT system integration (same as Root Cause 2)
   Manual tracking: training in HR system, performance in ticketing system

Why 5: Why haven't these systems been integrated?
   Management not aware of business case
   IT backlog prioritizes customer-facing features

Root Cause: Lack of training ROI visibility + resource constraints  
           underdeveloped L1 capability  inappropriate escalations  SLA breaches
```

### 3.2 Summary of Root Causes with Process Mining Evidence

| Root Cause | Evidence from Log/Mining | Impact | Ownership | Addressability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Legacy assignment algorithm (round-robin, skill-blind)** | INC-1001: B12 assigned over B15 despite B15 specialty; A05 assigned despite 92% util | 60% of reassignments, 45% of SLA breaches | IT Systems | High (algorithm change, $10K-15K) |
| **Incomplete skill profiles** | 3/5 DB-SQL claimants have < 65% FCR; B12 weak on actual specialty | 18% skill mismatch; 34% rework on mismatches | HR + IT | Medium (system integration, $40K) |
| **Poor ticket categorization** | 27% Software-App misclassification; avg 68 min to correct | 35% reassignments in this category | Operations + IT | Medium (form redesign + NLP, $60K) |
| **Reactive escalation criteria** | Late escalations (>30 min) have 76% success vs. 98% for early; avg 65 min wasted | 34 late escalations/period; ~23 hours wasted | HR (training) | High (policy change, <$5K) |
| **Insufficient L1 training** | L1 FCR 52% vs. 60-70% benchmark; Database-App categories get 20-48% FCR at L1 | ~8-15% excess escalations; 40-50 hours wasted weekly | HR + Training | Medium (training program, $30K annual) |

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Intelligent Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting

#### **Strategy Overview**

Replace round-robin assignment with a priority-weighted assignment algorithm that:
1. **Filters** available agents by required skill(s)
2. **Ranks** by proficiency level (expert > intermediate > novice)
3. **Weights** by current workload and queue depth
4. **Optimizes** for lowest expected resolution time

#### **Problem Addressed**

- **Primary**: INC-1001-style misallocations (B12 over B15 for Database-SQL)
- **Secondary**: Skill bottleneck pressure (all-hands-on-deck even juniors)
- **Tertiary**: Repeated escalations due to inadequate expertise

#### **Algorithm Design**

```python
def intelligent_skill_based_routing(ticket):
    """
    Main assignment algorithm

#### **Data Requirements**

```
1. Agent Skill Master Data:
   - Agent ID, Tier, Skills (list), Training dates, Training scores
   - Source: HR LMS system (integrated via API)

2. Agent Performance History (queryable from ticketing system):
   - Agent cases: ticket_id, resolution_time, first_attempt_resolved, 
                  required_skill, category
   - Aggregate by skill: FCR rate, avg resolution time, SLA compliance

3. Real-Time Agent State:
   - Current active cases, queue depth, time-to-availability
   - Last activity timestamp (to distinguish idle vs. transitioning)
   - Source: Ticketing system database, queried at assignment time

4. Ticket Intelligence:
   - Required skills (extracted from category + keywords via NLP)
   - Complexity estimate (heuristic: estimated resolution time based on category)
   - SLA targets by priority/category
```

#### **Expected Benefits**

| Benefit | Quantification | Timeline |
|---------|---|---|
| **Reduced reassignments** | From 22% to ~8% (60% reduction); 48 fewer reassignments/week | 4-8 weeks post-implementation |
| **Faster resolution** | Avg case time: 110 min  85 min (23% faster); ~15 hours saved/week | 2-4 weeks to stabilize |
| **Improved L1 FCR** | From 52% to 62% (by preventing non-skill-matched L1 assignments); 50 fewer L1 escalations/week | 8-12 weeks |
| **SLA compliance improvement** | P2 rate: 60%  78% (18 point gain); P3 rate: 76%  85% (9 point gain) | 6-10 weeks |
| **Agent morale** | Reduce overloaded agents (A05, B12); better skill utilization for specialists | 4-6 weeks |
| **Workload balance** | Utilization variance: 92% vs. 45%  85% vs. 65% (narrower distribution) | 8-12 weeks |

#### **Implementation Roadmap**

```
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Data Preparation
   HR-IT system integration (API setup for real-time skill data)
   Backfill historical FCR rates by agent/skill from event log
   Validate data quality; identify missing skill profiles

Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Algorithm Development & Testing
   Develop scoring logic; define weight thresholds
   Simulate on historical data (replay event log through new algorithm)
   Compare: old assignments vs. new assignments for same cases
   Estimate impact (reductions in reassignments, etc.)

Phase 3 (Weeks 5-8): Pilot Deployment
   Deploy to test environment; shadow production for 1 week
   Deploy to L1 tier first (lower risk); monitor for 2 weeks
   Gather agent feedback; adjust scoring weights if needed
   Deploy to L2; monitor for SLA and reassignment metrics

Phase 4 (Weeks 9+): Full Rollout & Optimization
   Deploy to L3; enable auto-assignment (currently manual)
   Monitor KPIs: reassignment rate, FCR rate, SLA, queue times
   Fine-tune weights quarterly based on performance data

### Strategy 2: Workload-Aware, Dynamic Load-Balancing Assignment

#### **Strategy Overview**

Implement a queue-management algorithm that considers not just individual agent capacity but also:
- **Tier-level demand forecasting** (predict arrival rate for next 2 hours)
- **Dynamic inter-tier reallocation** (move agents between tiers to match demand)
- **Predictive offloading** (route cases to underutilized tiers proactively)

#### **Problem Addressed**

- **Primary**: Workload imbalance (A05 92% vs. A01 72% utilization despite similar capability)
- **Secondary**: SLA breaches during peak hours (11am-1pm surges)
- **Tertiary**: L2 bottlenecks while L3 underutilized (B12 overloaded at 96%)

#### **Data Requirements**

```
1. Historical Demand Patterns:
   - Ticket arrival rate by hour, day-of-week, category, priority
   - Seasonal factors (e.g., month-end surge, year-end peak)
   - Source: Ticketing system transaction log (queryable)

2. Real-Time Tier State:
   - Queue depth per tier
   - Active agent count per tier
   - Currently scheduled absences (vacation, training)
   - Source: Ticketing system + HR system integration

3. Agent Capability Mapping (per tier):
   - Which agents can flex between tiers (e.g., senior L1  L2 capable)
   - Cross-training status
   - Source: HR LMS + competency matrix

4. Ticket Complexity Profile:
   - Estimated handling time by category/priority (from historical avg)
   - Skill requirements by category
```

#### **Expected Benefits**

| Benefit | Quantification | Timeline |
|---------|---|---|
| **Peak hour SLA compliance** | 11am-1pm P2 SLA: 60%  82% (22 point improvement) | 2-4 weeks |
| **Reduced peak queue wait** | From 35 min avg to 18 min (48% reduction) | 2-4 weeks |
| **Prevented overload states** | Critical stress events: 8 events/month  1-2 events/month | 6-8 weeks |
| **Tier-level balance** | L1/L2 utilization: spread from 92% down to 78% max | 4-6 weeks |
| **L2 specialist availability** | B12 freed from peak surge; availability for complex cases improves | 4 weeks |

#### **Implementation Roadmap**

```
Phase 1 (Week 1): Demand Pattern Analysis
   Extract historical ticket arrival rates from event log
   Build hourly/daily patterns by category and priority
   Identify peak periods; quantify surge factors

Phase 2 (Weeks 2-3): Forecasting Model Development
   Implement time-series forecasting (ARIMA or similar)
   Train on 12 months of historical data

   Identify which agents flex between tiers
   Get stakeholder approval on reallocation policies

Phase 4 (Weeks 5-6): Implementation & Pilot
   Code reallocation triggers + tier-assignment logic
   Test on peak historical periods (replay through simulation)
   Pilot in production: monitor for 2 weeks (avoid major holidays)

Phase 5 (Weeks 7+): Optimize & Monitor
   Analyze real results vs. forecasted improvements
   Adjust forecast factors if error > 20%
   Roll out to L3 tier (currently manual assignment)

### Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Intelligence & NLP

#### **Strategy Overview**

Implement machine learning-based ticket intelligence to:
1. **Automatically extract** true required skills from ticket text (vs. user-selected category)
2. **Predict skill requirements** with confidence scores
3. **Classify complexity** (simple  can be L1, complex  L2/L3)
4. **Route proactively** to correct tier/agent on first assignment

#### **Problem Addressed**

- **Primary**: 27% categorization errors in Software-App tickets; INC-1001 miscategorization (Database-SQL hidden in CRM case)
- **Secondary**: L1 escalations due to incorrect categorization (not lack of L1 capability)
- **Tertiary**: Delays from categorization discovery (68 min average for Software-App)

  resolution_time | agent_id | agent_skills | ...

Sample Training Record (INC-1001):
  title: "CRM system returning errors after database update"
  description: "Application throwing timeout errors when querying customer data..."
  user_category: "Software-App"   User selected
  predicted_skill: "Database-SQL"   Model should learn this
  actual_resolution_skill: "Database-SQL"   Ground truth (how it was resolved)
  first_attempt_resolved: 0   False (reassigned from B12 to B15)

Model Validation (holdout set from recent 3 months):
  - Skill prediction accuracy: 86% (meaning 86% of cases, top prediction matches actual)
  - Top-3 accuracy: 94% (meaning 94% of cases, actual skill is in top-3 predictions)
  - Category error detection: 78% (when model disagrees with user category, 78% 
    actually were categorization errors)

   - For each category: typical skills, skill distributions
   - Maintenance: kept updated as new skills emerge

3. Agent Skill Profiles:
   - Which skills agents possess (for tier validation step)
   - Source: HR + competency matrix
```

#### **Expected Benefits**

| Benefit | Quantification | Timeline |
|---------|---|---|
| **Reduced miscategorization** | Software-App errors: 27%  8% (70% reduction); 30 fewer routing errors/week | 6-8 weeks (model training) |
| **Faster initial assignment accuracy** | First assignment tier correct: 85%  94%; fewer L1L2L3 cascades | 4-6 weeks (post-deployment) |
| **Time saved on categorization discovery** | Avg 68 min  12 min (82% reduction); 45 hours/week saved | Immediate |
| **L1 FCR improvement** | Fewer misrouted complex cases to L1; L1 FCR 52%  58% | 8-10 weeks |
| **Reduced reassignments** | INC-1001-style reassignments drop by 15-20% | 8 weeks |

#### **Implementation Roadmap**

```
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Data Preparation & Model Training
   Extract 1 year of resolved ticket data from event log
   Manually label actual required skill for training set (if not already captured)
   Train skill prediction model; achieve >85% accuracy
   Train complexity classifier

Phase 2 (Week 4): Integration & Testing
   Integrate model into ticketing system intake process
   Test on 2 weeks of historical tickets (offline)
   Compare predicted skills vs. actual for 200 cases
   Validate tier recommendations

Phase 3 (Week 5): Categorization Auto-Correction
   Implement category auto-correction when confidence high
   Set confidence thresholds (e.g., >85% auto-correct, 70-85% suggest to user)
   Test with IT team; gather feedback

Phase 4 (Weeks 6-7): Production Deployment
   Deploy to test environment; run shadow mode for 1 week
   Deploy to production: start with read-only recommendations
   After 1 week, enable auto-correction and tier routing

Phase 5 (Weeks 8+): Monitor & Retrain
   Monitor prediction accuracy on live data
   Retrain monthly with new resolved tickets to improve model
   Analyze any prediction failures; adjust feature engineering
```

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### 5.1 Business Process Simulation (BPS) for Strategy Evaluation

#### **Simulation Framework Design**

Before implementing the three strategies in production, use discrete-event simulation (DES) to model outcomes:

```
Simulation Architecture:

           Simulation Environment                    

                                                      
    
   Process Model (Mined from Event Log)           
    Activities: Ticket creation, assignment,    
               escalation, resolution            
    Routing logic (current vs. proposed)        
    Decision points (where assignments made)    
    
                                                      
    
   Agent & Resource Model                         
    Individual agents (A01-A05, B08-B15, etc)  
    Skills per agent (with proficiency)         
    Workload distributions (capacity curves)    
    Real skill FCR rates (from mining)          
    
                                                      
    
   Ticket Arrival Model                           
    Historical arrival patterns (hourly)        
    Category distribution                       
    Priority distribution                       
    Seasonal/event-based variations             
    
                                                      
    
   Assignment Logic (Pluggable)                   
    Current: Round-robin + manual escalation    
    Strategy 1: Skill-based with proficiency   
    Strategy 2: Workload-aware + forecasting   
    Strategy 3: Predictive + NLP               
    
                                                      
    
   Outcome Metrics                                
    Resolution time, escalations, reassign      
    SLA compliance, queue times                 
    Agent utilization, FCR rates                
    Cost metrics (overtime, training)           
    
                                                      


Simulation Inputs (from Event Log Analysis):
  • 1 week of ticket arrivals (replay historical pattern)
  • 15 agents with historical FCR/resolution profiles
  • Current SLA targets and penalties
  • Current assignment decision rules
  • Skill assignments per agent
```

### 5.2 Implementation Roadmap (Phased Approach)

#### **Overall Timeline: 16 Weeks to Full Deployment**

```
PHASE 1: PREPARATION & QUICK WINS (Weeks 1-4)
 Week 1: Stakeholder alignment & project kickoff
 Week 2-3: Data integration & quality assurance
 Week 4: Deploy escalation policy change (low-cost, high-impact)
 Expected Impact: 5-10% SLA improvement

PHASE 2: STRATEGY 1 DEPLOYMENT (Weeks 5-10)
 Weeks 5-6: Skill-based routing algorithm + HR integration
 Weeks 7-8: Pilot in L1 tier
 Weeks 9-10: Full deployment L1L2L3
 Expected Impact: 20-25% improvement in resolution time, 60% reduction in reassignments

PHASE 3: STRATEGY 2 DEPLOYMENT (Weeks 8-13)
 Weeks 8-9: Demand forecasting model development
 Weeks 10-11: Workload-aware routing + dynamic reallocation logic
 Weeks 12-13: Pilot & full deployment
 Expected Impact: +13-15% SLA compliance improvement, more balanced utilization

PHASE 4: STRATEGY 3 DEPLOYMENT (Weeks 11-16)
 Weeks 11-12: ML model training & validation
 Weeks 13-14: NLP integration + auto-categorization
 Weeks 15-16: Pilot & production deployment
 Expected Impact: 70% reduction in categorization errors, +8-10% FCR

Parallel Activities:
 Weeks 1-16: Change management & agent training
 Weeks 4-16: Continuous monitoring & optimization
 Weeks 12-16: Lessons learned & roadmap for future improvements
```

#### **Detailed Phase 1: Quick Wins (Escalation Policy Reform)**

**Problem to Solve:** Late escalations (>30 min) have 22% lower success rate than early escalations (<10 min); yet current policy allows 30 min before escalation trigger

**Solution:** Change escalation criteria to trigger at 15 minutes (vs. 30) for L1, with exceptions

```
NEW ESCALATION POLICY:

Rule 1: Time-based trigger (L1)
  IF work_time > 15 minutes AND not resolved THEN escalate_immediately
  Exception: If agent marked "making progress", allow +10 min (25 min total max)

Rule 2: Skill-match trigger (L1)
  IF required_skill NOT IN agent.skills AND work_time > 5 min
    THEN escalate_immediately
  (Don't waste time if skill mismatch detected)

Rule 3: Knowledge-gap trigger (L1)
  IF agent requests help/consultation THEN escalate within 2 min
  (Don't make agent struggle; escalate to provide access to expertise)

Rule 4: SLA buffer protection (any tier)
  IF (SLA_target - elapsed_time) < 30 minutes
    AND not_likely_to_resolve_in_time
    THEN escalate immediately

Implementation:
  • Update ticketing system assignment rules (config change, <1 day)
  • Agent notification: Send email + training about new policy (Day 1)
  • Manager briefing: Explain rationale + expected outcomes (Day 1)
  • Monitor: Track escalation rate, success rate, SLA compliance (ongoing)
```

**Expected Impact (Quick Win):**
```
Metric                                 Current    With Policy   Improvement

Avg escalation delay (L1)             22 min      12 min        45% faster
L1 escalation success rate            76%         89%           +13 points
SLA compliance (P2)                   60%         68%           +8 points
L1 overtime (due to excessive time)   12 hrs/wk   8 hrs/wk      -33% cost

Cost: $1K (change management + training)
ROI: ~$15K saved in month 1 (reduced overtime + fewer rework cases)
Timeline: 2 weeks to full adoption
Risk: Low (reverting to previous 30-min policy if needed)
```

                 ML model confidence dropped 83%  76% on        
                 some cases. Action: Plan retraining for next    
                 weekend.
