This is a process-flow visualization that stitches together several related business object types into one endtoend view.

Key elements:
- Four object types across the top: VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M), ReturnOrderItem (0.8M), PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M), SalesOrderItem (3.5M), and PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M). Each has a “Start” node that feeds into the flow.
- Activities are shown as rounded rectangles with an “Overall” volume metric (number of objects that passed through that step). Examples: Create Requisition (3.0M), Approve Requisition (5.7M), Send Order (5.2M), Check Stock (1.0M), Approve Payment (1.5M), Create Invoice (2.0M), Process Return (0.8M), Create Order (8.5M), Pack Goods (2.0M), Ship Goods (1.8M), Confirm Delivery (1.7M), Close Order (1.7M).
- Directed edges connect steps, with small latency labels (e.g., 300 ms, 450 ms). These represent average transition times between activities.
- Multiple colored paths overlay the graph, indicating different object classes/streams moving through the same activities:
  - Green appears associated with VendorInvoiceItem/returns/invoicing paths.
  - Red corresponds to return/order-closing paths.
  - Blue represents purchase/sales order processing.
  - Purple indicates requisition/order-sending/stock-checking path.
- The flow branches and rejoins, showing alternative routes (e.g., after Approve Requisition, items can go to Send Order, Check Stock, Process Return, or Approve Payment).
- Several terminal “End” nodes at the bottom show where paths conclude.

Overall, the diagram summarizes volumes and transition times across an integrated procuretopay and ordertocash process, including requisitions, order creation and fulfillment, returns handling, invoicing, and closure.
