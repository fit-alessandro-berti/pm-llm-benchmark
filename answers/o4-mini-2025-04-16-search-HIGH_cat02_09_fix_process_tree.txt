1. Issues with the current underfitting model  
   - By placing **Create_Purchase_Order**, **Receive_Goods**, **Receive_Invoice**, **Match_Invoice_to_PO** and **Pay_Invoice** all under a single `PARALLEL` operator, the model allows, for example, an invoice to be paid before it’s even received, or before goods are received, or before matching against the PO.  
   - Domain-appropriately, you must always  
     1. create the PO first,  
     2. then receive goods (or invoice) only after the PO exists,  
     3. only match the invoice after both the goods and the invoice have arrived,  
     4. only pay once the invoice has been successfully matched,  
     5. and only close the case after payment.  
   - The current model underfits because it doesn’t encode these prerequisites: everything after PO creation can happen in any order.

2. Corrected process-tree model  
   ```python
   from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

   # Define activities
   create_req      = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
   approve_req     = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
   create_po       = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
   receive_goods   = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
   receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
   match_invoice   = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
   pay_invoice     = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
   close_case      = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

   # Only goodsandinvoice can happen in parallel (order between those two is unconstrained),
   # but matching and payment must wait until both are done.
   goods_and_invoice = ProcessTree(
       operator=Operator.PARALLEL,
       children=[receive_goods, receive_invoice]
   )

   # Toplevel sequence enforces the full, correct procuretopay order
   root = ProcessTree(
       operator=Operator.SEQUENCE,
       children=[
           create_req,
           approve_req,
           create_po,
           goods_and_invoice,
           match_invoice,
           pay_invoice,
           close_case
       ]
   )
   ```

3. How the fixed model enforces correct behavior  
   - **Strict sequencing** for all major phases:  
     1. Requisition  2. Approval  3. PO creation  …  8. Close.  
     Each numbered step cannot start until its predecessor completes.  
   - **Localized parallelism** only between “Receive_Goods” and “Receive_Invoice”:  
     these two can occur in either order (sometimes an invoice arrives before goods, sometimes after), but neither can jump ahead to matching or payment.  
   - **Match  Pay  Close** are pure sequences:  
     you cannot pay until matching succeeds, and you cannot close the case until payment is done.  
   - By replacing the broad parallel block with one that contains only the two truly concurrent activities, we eliminate all out-of-order and domain-invalid paths (e.g. “Pay_Invoice” before “Receive_Invoice”) while still allowing legitimate variability.
