To construct a process tree that captures the events observed in the event log, we need to balance capturing both the main sequence of activities and the optional repeating behavior. The process tree model should be constructed using the operators defined: sequence (`->`), exclusive choice (`X`), parallel (`+`), and loop (`*`).

Here's a step-by-step approach to building the process tree:

### Observations from the Event Log:

1. **Common Sequence**: 
   - Receive Application (RA)
   - Validate Form (VF)
   - Assess Eligibility (AE)

2. **Optional Loop**: 
   - Request Missing Info (RMI) can occur zero or more times.
   - Upon each Request Missing Info (RMI), Validate Form (VF) is revisited.

3. **Final Sequence** (after loop ends):
   - Approval Decision (AD)
   - Send Confirmation (SC)
   - Archive Case (AC)

### Process Tree Construction:

1. **Main Sequence**: 
   - Start with the common sequence: RA -> VF -> AE.

2. **Optional Loop**:
   - After `Assess Eligibility (AE)`, there is a loop where `Request Missing Info (RMI)` and `Validate Form (VF)` can occur multiple times.
   - Use a loop operator (`*`) to model this behavior.

3. **Ending Sequence**:
   - After exiting the loop, the process moves to `Approval Decision (AD)`, `Send Confirmation (SC)`, and `Archive Case (AC)`.

### Process Tree Structure:

The process tree can be described as follows:

- **Root Node**: A sequence (`->`) of three main parts: initial activities, the optional loop, and the final activities.

1. **Initial Activities**: RA -> VF -> AE

2. **Optional Loop**:
   - Use an exclusive choice (`X`) to model the optionality of the loop.
   - Within the exclusive choice, use a loop (`*`) to represent the repeating behavior:
     - Start the loop with `Request Missing Info (RMI)` followed by `Validate Form (VF)`.

3. **Final Activities**: After the loop, continue with `Approval Decision (AD)`, `Send Confirmation (SC)`, and `Archive Case (AC)`.

### Final Process Tree:

```plaintext
-> ( 
    -> ( 
        'RA', 
        -> ( 
            'VF', 
            -> ( 
                'AE', 
                X ( 
                    -> ( 
                        '*', 
                        -> ( 
                            'RMI', 
                            'VF' 
                        ) 
                    ), 
                    tau 
                ) 
            ) 
        ) 
    ), 
    -> ( 
        'AD', 
        'SC', 
        'AC' 
    ) 
)
```

### Explanation:

- **`RA -> VF -> AE`**: Captures the initial common sequence.
- **`X ( -> ( '*', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), tau )`**: Represents the optional loop where `RMI` and `VF` can repeat. `tau` represents the option to exit the loop.
- **`AD -> SC -> AC`**: Captures the final sequence after the optional loop.

This structure captures the main flow, the optional loop for missing information, and the eventual ending sequence, balancing fitness, precision, and simplicity.
