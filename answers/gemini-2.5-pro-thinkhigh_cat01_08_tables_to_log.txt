Of course. Here is the integrated event log created from the provided ERP tables, suitable for process mining.

### Assumptions Made

1.  **Case ID**: The `order_id` is used as the unique case identifier for the entire process instance.
2.  **Activity Derivation**:
    *   **Order Created**: Sourced from the `Orders` table using `order_date`.
    *   **Item Picked**: Each line in the `Order Lines` table is treated as a separate event, reflecting individual picking activities.
    *   **Order Dispatched & Arrived**: The `Delivery` table contains two timestamps per record. Each record generates two distinct events: one for `delivery_dispatch_date` and one for `delivery_arrival_date`.
    *   **Invoice Issued**: Each record in the `Invoice` table corresponds to a single "Invoice Issued" event.
    *   **Payment Received**: Each payment record is an event. The `order_id` is derived by joining the `Payments` and `Invoice` tables.
3.  **Resource Mapping**: Resource IDs (`sales_person_id`, `picker_id`, `carrier_id`, `billing_person_id`) have been mapped to their full names using the `Resources` table. The resource for "Payment Received" is considered external (the customer) and is thus left blank.
4.  **Data Enrichment**: A `Details` column has been added to provide context-specific attributes for each event, such as item IDs, quantities, invoice amounts, and delivery IDs.
5.  **Chronological Order**: The final event log is sorted first by `Case ID` and then chronologically by `Timestamp` to reflect the true sequence of events for each process instance.
