Of course. Here is the comprehensive event log created by integrating the provided ERP tables.

### Assumptions Made

1.  **Case ID**: The `order_id` is used as the unique `Case ID` for the process.
2.  **Activity Granularity**:
    *   Each line item in the `Order Lines` table is treated as a distinct "Item Picked" event. This provides a detailed view of the picking process.
    *   Each record in the `Delivery` table generates two separate events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived," using their respective timestamps.
3.  **Resource Mapping**:
    *   The `resource_id` from the various tables was mapped to `resource_name` using the `Resources` table.
    *   For "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events, the `carrier_id` is considered the resource.
    *   For "Payment Received," there is no direct resource person. The `payment_method` is included as an attribute, and the Resource column is left blank as the action is typically performed by the customer or an automated system.
4.  **Data Linking**: The `Payments` table was linked to the `order_id` by joining it with the `Invoice` table.
5.  **Attribute Selection**: The "Other Attributes" column includes relevant contextual information from the source tables, such as `item_id`, `quantity`, `invoice_amount`, and `delivery_id`, to enrich the log.
