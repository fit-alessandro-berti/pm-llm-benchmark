To construct a representative temporal profile for the complex global supply chain process, we need to consider the dependencies and delays typically intrinsic to each step and the relationships between activities. Given the constraints and to ensure reasonable estimates, I'll provide plausible average times and standard deviations for a selection of activity pairs. The times are estimated in seconds, considering factors like typical durations in the industry and variability due to operational dynamics.

Here's the Python dictionary representing the temporal profile:

```python
temporal_profile = {

    ('SS', 'RC'): (1728000, 345600),  # Supplier Selection to Receive Components (20 days avg, 4 days std)

This dictionary provides estimated average times and standard deviations for a variety of activity pairs in the supply chain. These estimates are based on industry norms and reasonable assumptions about variability in process times. Adjustments can be made based on specific data and domain knowledge.
