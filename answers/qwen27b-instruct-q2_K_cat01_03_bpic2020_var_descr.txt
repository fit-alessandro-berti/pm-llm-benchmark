This data appears to detail various stages in a workflow or approval process for declarations or similar requests within an organization, possibly relating to financial transactions involving payments.

From reading through each description:

- It begins with employees initially submitting declarations.
  
  
  
  

The next stage involves supervisory roles checking these submissions:
  
  
  
  

Sometimes these supervisors approve them immediately:


(1) They are sent straight-ahead if they meet criteria and get approved by the supervisor, who then sends them onward to payment processing.


(2) Sometimes there's additional review or denial, with some exceptions if the process reaches a state that needs verification or reevaluation.


When denied initially:


The original declaration is often rejected by various supervisors, including themselves after initial approval was made mistakenly:


(1) If the supervisor denies it due to missing elements or misfitting criteria.


(2) The employee then corrects errors and resubmits:


(3a) If another supervisor accepts it post-correction:


(4)b But again rejects it if there are further issues, this time by the supervisor after resubmission:


(5)c or by the original supervisor or employee if they themselves were initially mistaken:


(6d) The process may go back through to ensure all steps meet standards:


Finally:


The final stage is payment handling once everything else goes through correctly.


This data describes a multi-layered workflow that involves several decision points requiring various levels of approvals before reaching completion, which includes corrections for any issues identified during approval stages.


Please note:


The data provided gives frequency and performance metrics indicating how often these events occurred within the process. It's important to recognize specific roles (employees, supervisors etc.) as well as their actions like 'approved', 'rejected', 'final approved', among others that could be more specific depending on context are not directly listed here but are implied by descriptions.


The process seems designed carefully to ensure quality control through checks, corrections where needed towards final completion stages involving payments.


However without further context or specific role identification this description remains a high-level interpretation based solely on provided data.
