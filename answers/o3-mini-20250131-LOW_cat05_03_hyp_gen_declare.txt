Below are the findings broken down into three sections:

  
1. Anomalies Identified

• Conflict between “responded_existence” and “noncoexistence”:  
– “responded_existence” requires that an evaluation (E) must be preceded by an assignment (A), but “noncoexistence” prevents evaluation (E) from co-occurring with closing (C). Since in the ideal process flow evaluation is necessary before approval and closing, this constraint inadvertently disallows the proper progression if, for example, an evaluation naturally leads into a closing step.

• Redundant or unnecessary constraints:  
– The “init” and “existence” constraints guarantee that claims follow extreme minimum conditions – a claim must be received (R) and closed (C) – which might oversimplify the process and leave no room for manual oversight or error handling.

• Counterintuitive ordering constraints:  
– The “precedence” constraint requires that a close (C) must be preceded by a receive (R), but this is a weak condition given that receive is the natural first event. It does not enforce the intermediate workflow steps such as assign (A), evaluate (E), approve (P) or notify (N).

  
2. Hypotheses for the Anomalies

• Misinterpretation of Business Requirements:  
Business needs might have been translated into constraints without a full understanding of how they interact. For instance, one team may have focused on ensuring every claim is received and closed, while another team tried to enforce tighter control on evaluation and closing processes.

• Incremental Policy Changes:  
The model may have evolved as policy changes were introduced. Some constraints from earlier versions (such as requiring “R” and “C”) were retained even though later changes demanded additional steps (like evaluation and assignment). This stepwise evolution can result in contradictory or overlapping rules.

• Technical Implementation Issues:  
The contradictory constraints may be the result of an incomplete or rushed implementation of the DECLARE model. Inadequate validation, missing edge-case analysis, or lack of integration testing between business rules could lead to such anomalies.

• Operational Pressure and Workarounds:  
Pressure to accelerate claims processing might lead to constraints that ignore necessary intermediate checks (e.g., evaluation) in favor of fast resolution, inadvertently suppressing validations that enforce sequential steps.

  
3. Verification Approaches via SQL Queries

To investigate if and how the anomalies manifest in the system, the following SQL queries could be used:

A. Identify Claims Closed Without an Evaluation Step  
This query searches the claim_events table for claims with a closing event “C” but lacking an evaluation event “E”:
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM claim_events ce_eval
WHERE ce_eval.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
);

B. Verify Order Between Assignment and Evaluation  
Check for instances where an evaluation “E” occurs without a preceding assignment “A”:
SELECT ce_eval.claim_id, ce_eval.timestamp AS eval_time
FROM claim_events ce_eval
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_assign ON ce_eval.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id
AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
AND ce_assign.timestamp < ce_eval.timestamp
WHERE ce_eval.activity = 'E' AND ce_assign.event_id IS NULL;

C. Find Cases Where Evaluation and Closing Coexist in Violative Patterns  
Determine claims that have both “E” and “C” events, which might indicate an unintended overlook of the noncoexistence rule (depending on its intended enforcement):
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E', 'C')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2;

D. Correlate Adjuster Assignment with Evaluation  
Ensure that for a claim’s evaluation, there is a corresponding adjuster assignment (assuming resource corresponds to an adjuster when “A” occurs):
SELECT ce_eval.claim_id, ce_eval.timestamp AS eval_time, ce_assign.resource AS assigned_adjuster
FROM claim_events ce_eval
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_assign ON ce_eval.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id
AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
AND ce_assign.timestamp < ce_eval.timestamp
WHERE ce_eval.activity = 'E'
ORDER BY ce_eval.claim_id, ce_eval.timestamp;

These queries help verify whether the anomalies listed are observed in practice and whether the actual event flow matches the intended insurance claim process.
