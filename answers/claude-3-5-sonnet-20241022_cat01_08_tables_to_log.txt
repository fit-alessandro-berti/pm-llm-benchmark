I'll help create a comprehensive event log based on the provided data. I'll make a few key assumptions and decisions:

1. For item picking events, I'll create a single "Items Picked" event per order using the latest picking time.
2. For split deliveries, I'll create separate dispatch and arrival events.
3. For multiple invoices/payments on a single order, I'll create separate events for each.

Here's the event log in markdown format:

Notes and Assumptions:
1. Order 1004 appears incomplete in the dataset (no delivery, invoice, or payment records), so it was excluded.
2. Resource names were mapped from IDs using the Resources table.
3. Payment events are attributed to "System" as no specific human resource is indicated.
4. For multiple item picks, the latest picking time was used as the event timestamp.
5. All events are sorted chronologically within each case.
6. Additional attributes include relevant reference numbers and amounts to maintain traceability.
