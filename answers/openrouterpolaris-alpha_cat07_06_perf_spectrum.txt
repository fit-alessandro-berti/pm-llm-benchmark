Here’s what the visualization shows:

- It is a time-based event flow between three stages in a fines process:
  - Top horizontal line: “Send Fine”
  - Middle horizontal line: “Insert Fine Notification”
  - Bottom horizontal line: “Send for Credit Collection”
- The x-axis is time, running from 2000-01-25 on the left to 2013-04-24 on the right.
- Vertical gray lines in the top band mark individual “Send Fine” events, densely packed over the years.
- From each “Insert Fine Notification” event (middle line), light and dark red diagonal lines run downward to “Send for Credit Collection” (bottom line), indicating cases that progress from notification to credit collection.
- The diagonals form many long, thin triangles, visually encoding:
  - The presence of a linkage between events (a specific fine’s path),
  - The time delay between notification and collection (longer horizontal span = longer delay),
  - The overall volume and distribution of such transitions.

In essence, it’s a dense timeline diagram showing how many fines are sent, notified, and eventually escalated to credit collection, along with the timing between these steps.
