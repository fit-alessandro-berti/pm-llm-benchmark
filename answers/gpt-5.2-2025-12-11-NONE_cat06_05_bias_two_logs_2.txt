**Group B exhibits bias.** Group A applies the same scoring process to everyone (no association-based adjustment), while Group B changes candidates’ evaluated “CulturalFit” based on membership in a specific professional association (“LocalBusinessLeadersClub”).

## How the bias manifests
- **Explicit preferential treatment:** In Group B, candidates affiliated with *LocalBusinessLeadersClub* receive a **+5 cultural fit boost** (“Association Boost”). This is not tied to measured competencies (skill, personality) but to **network/affiliation**, which functions as a proxy advantage.
- **Decision-relevant impact:** The boost affects final values used at interview/decision stages:
  - **U001:** CulturalFit 60  **65** with +5; decision = **Hired**.
  - **U003:** CulturalFit 58  **63** with +5; decision = **Hired**.
  - A comparable pattern is absent in Group A—no one receives a structured uplift from an external affiliation.
- **Creates an uneven playing field:** Two candidates with the same underlying cultural fit score can have different hiring outcomes solely due to association membership. That is differential treatment on a non-merit factor.

## Why this is a fairness/equity problem
- **Disparate advantage (and likely disparate impact):** If protected groups are less likely to have access to that association (due to historical exclusion, socioeconomic barriers, geography, etc.), the boost systematically **tilts hiring toward the unprotected group**, even without directly using protected attributes.
- **Violates procedural fairness:** The process is not consistent across candidates; some are evaluated with an extra benefit unrelated to job-relevant assessment.
- **Undermines merit-based selection validity:** “Cultural fit” is already subjective and can encode similarity/affinity preferences; adding a network-based boost compounds that risk and can entrench homogeneity.

## Bottom line
- **Bias is present in Group B** because it embeds a **rule-based preference** for a particular affiliation that influences hiring decisions.
- **Group A is comparatively more equitable** in that it does not apply affiliation-driven score adjustments (though it could still be biased in other ways not shown—e.g., how “cultural fit” is defined—but there is no explicit association-based advantage).
