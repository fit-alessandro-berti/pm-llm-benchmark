 Based on the provided process variants, several potential root causes for performance issues can be identified:

1. **Rejection by Administrators**: There are multiple process variants that involve a declaration being rejected by administrators (ADMINISTRATION or PRE_APPROVER), requiring the employee to resubmit the declaration. This could lead to increased processing time and potential performance issues, especially if the rejections are frequent.

2. **Rejection by Supervisors**: There are also multiple process variants where a supervisor rejects the declaration, which might indicate that either the initial declarations have issues or the supervisors are overloaded with work. This can lead to delays in processing times and potential performance issues.

3. **Budget Owner Approvals**: In some process variants, an approval from a Budget Owner is required before the final approval by the Supervisor. If the Budget Owners are not prompt in their approvals, this could lead to delays and performance issues.

4. **Missings**: Several process variants involve a step where a 'Missing' is encountered, which leads to the declaration being resubmitted. This could indicate that there are missing pieces of information or documentation in the declarations, causing delays and potential performance issues.

5. **Multiple Approvals**: Some process variants have multiple approval steps (Administration -> Budget Owner -> Supervisor) before a payment can be handled. While this might ensure thorough review of each declaration, it could also lead to increased processing times and potential performance issues.

6. **Re-submission of Rejected Declarations**: There are cases where rejected declarations are resubmitted multiple times (e.g., up to 3 resubmissions in some instances) before being finally approved. This could suggest that the initial declarations may need improvement, or there might be issues in the approval process leading to rejections, causing delays and potential performance issues.

To improve performance, it would be beneficial to investigate these root causes further and consider measures such as improving the quality of initial declarations, optimizing approval processes, reducing the number of approval steps (if possible), and ensuring prompt responses from approvers. Additionally, monitoring and analyzing the frequency and reasons for rejections can help in identifying patterns and taking corrective actions.
