Based on the provided BPMN 2.0 XML, I was able to find a few tasks in the process model:

1. `id34fba6ea-bbb7-47b7-94a8-3417ede3ceef`: There is an activiti task with id `id34fba6ea-bbb7-47b7-94a8-3417ede3ceef` with no name.
2. `id3152b404-1b39-4c61-bff7-1e4e507f627a`: There is an activiti task with id `id3152b404-1b39-4c61-bff7-1e4e507f627a` with no name.
3. `idd371ddf5-0e93-4afa-bd26-49c2c4bc293e`: There is an activiti task with id `idd371ddf5-0e93-4afa-bd26-49c2c4bc293e` with no name.

Note that there are other elements, such as gateways (e.g., intermediate or exclusive), transitions, and sequence flows, but they do not contain tasks.
