## Process Flow (BPMN-style Description)

1. **Start Event**: *Invoice Received*  
   - Trigger: Invoice arrives via email (or occasionally by mail) to Accounts Payable Clerk.

2. **Task A1 [AP Clerk]**: *Validate Presence of PO Number*  
   - Input: Incoming Invoice  
   - Output: Determination “PO present?”  

3. **Exclusive Gateway G1**: *PO Present?*  
   - **No**  **Task A2 [AP Clerk]**: *Return Invoice to Supplier*  
       - Action: Send email to supplier requesting correct PO reference.  
       - End: **Intermediate End Event** “Await Revised Invoice” (loops back to Start when supplier responds).  
   - **Yes**  proceed to Task A3.

4. **Task A3 [AP Clerk]**: *Log Invoice into Accounting System*  
   - Input: Invoice with PO  
   - Output: Invoice record in system.  

5. **Task A4 [AP Clerk]**: *Forward Invoice for Receipt Confirmation*  
   - Recipient: Purchasing Officer  
   - Artifact: Invoice record link/email.

6. **Task B1 [Purchasing Officer]**: *Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services*  
   - Input: Invoice + PO details  
   - Output: Receipt Confirmation (yes/no).  

7. **Task A5 [AP Clerk]**: *Match Invoice Line Items Against PO*  
   - Input: Invoice, PO, Receipt Confirmation  
   - **Variation**: In some teams, Purchasing Officer handles this matching step instead of the AP Clerk.

8. **Exclusive Gateway G2**: *Invoice vs. PO Match?*  
   - **Yes (Match OK)**  proceed to Task A6.  
   - **No (Discrepancy)**  Task A7.

9. **Task A7 [AP Clerk]**: *Send Discrepancy Notice to Purchasing*  
   - Content: Details of incorrect pricing, quantities, missing items.  

10. **Exclusive Gateway G3**: *Discrepancy Resolvable by Purchasing?*  
    - **Yes**  loop back to Task B1 or Task A5 for reconfirmation and rematching.  
    - **No**  Task A8.

11. **Task A8 [AP Clerk]**: *Escalate to AP Supervisor*  
    - Notify: Accounts Payable Supervisor.  

12. **Task C1 [AP Supervisor]**: *Resolve Exception*  
    - Activities (one or more):  
      • Contact Supplier (often via Supplier Relationship Manager) to correct invoice or supply missing PO.  
      • Coordinate with department head to create Retrospective PO for informal services.  
      • Decide to reject invoice if non-recoverable.  
    - Output: Exception Resolved  loop back to Task A5 (for matching) or Task B1 (for confirmation) as appropriate.

13. **Task A6 [AP Clerk]**: *Trigger Manager Approval*  
    - System Action: Automatic email with invoice+PO+confirmation link sent to Department Manager.

14. **Task D1 [Department Manager]**: *Review and Approve or Reject*  
    - Input: System Approval Request  
    - Decision Criteria: quantities, pricing, budget alignment, unexpected items.

15. **Exclusive Gateway G4**: *Manager Decision*  
    - **Approve**  Task A9.  
    - **Reject**  Task D2.

16. **Task D2 [Department Manager]**: *Reject Invoice*  
    - Action: System marks invoice “Rejected”; sends back to AP Clerk for further investigation.  
    - Flow: Returns to Task A7 or Task A8 depending on nature of rejection.

17. **Task A9 [AP Clerk]**: *Schedule for Payment Run*  
    - Action: Add approved invoice to next payment batch in accounting system.

18. **End Event**: *Invoice Scheduled for Payment*

## Gateways & Decision Points
  - G1: PO Present?  Return to Supplier vs. Log Invoice  
  - G2: Invoice vs. PO Match?  Continue vs. Discrepancy Path  
  - G3: Discrepancy Resolvable by Purchasing?  Re-confirm/Re-match vs. Escalation  
  - G4: Manager Decision  Approved vs. Rejected  

---

## Roles & Responsibilities
  - **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**:  
    • Initial PO validation, system logging, sending to Purchasing, matching, sending discrepancies, triggering approvals, scheduling payments.  
    • Escalates to supervisor when unresolved discrepancies occur.  
  - **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**:  
    • Confirms receipt of goods/services.  
    • Often helps with matching invoice to PO (quantity, pricing).  
    • Clarifies PO issues before AP moves forward.  
  - **Department Manager (Carlos)**:  
    • Final approval authority; can reject and send back for investigation.  
  - **AP Supervisor (Rita)**:  
    • Handles exceptions beyond routine discrepancies (missing PO, informal services).  
    • Coordinates cross-departmentally and with suppliers to unblock invoices.  
  - **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**:  
    • Engaged by AP Supervisor or Purchasing to resolve supplier-side issues (contract pricing, PO references).  
  - **Supplier**:  
    • Provides invoice, responds to PO requests and discrepancy queries.  

---

## Exceptions & Variations
  - **No PO on Invoice**  
    • Returned immediately to supplier (Task A2).  
    • For informal services, AP Supervisor may create retrospective PO (Task C1).  
  - **Invoice/PO Mismatch**  
    • If pricing or quantity errors exist, Purchasing may correct the PO or ask supplier for a revised invoice.  
    • Unresolvable mismatches escalate to AP Supervisor.  
  - **Manager Rejection**  
    • If manager finds budget or item issues, invoice returns to AP for fresh review or escalation.  
  - **Alternate Matching Actor**  
    • In some cases, Purchasing Officer performs the lineitem match (Task B1 + matching), then signals AP Clerk to proceed.

**Notes on Ambiguities**
  - Mary reports that Accounts Payable always does the matching; Dan describes Purchasing doing the initial match. Both are included as alternate flows.  
  - Dan assumes that once he confirms, AP Clerk immediately moves to manager; Mary consistently matches before routing to manager. This is captured by noting either AP Clerk or Purchasing may perform matching prior to approval.  
  - The precise handoff event between Purchase receipt confirmation and matching varies; represented here as sequential tasks with a possible role swap.
