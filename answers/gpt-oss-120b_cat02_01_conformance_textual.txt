We need to produce answer: list violating cases and explain each violation. Use LaTeX for math expressions. No code needed. Provide clear reasoning. Cases: 1 seems correct (full sequence). 2: Package before Authorize payment violates "Package items" should occur after authorization. So case 2 violates. 3: Cancel then Ship order violates "Ship order" should not occur after cancellation. Also Authorize before Cancel? Actually after Cancel, no further fulfillment. So violation. 4: correct (receive, check, cancel, close). 5: Missing Package items before Ship; also missing Cancel? Actually inventory sufficient, but they skipped packaging. So violation: shipping without packaging, also missing package step. Also missing close? They have close. So case 5 violates. Also maybe missing Authorize before Ship? They have Authorize then Ship, but missing Package. So violation.

Thus violating cases: 2,3,5. Provide explanation. Use LaTeX for referencing constraints: e.g., \(\text{Authorize payment} \rightarrow \text{Package items}\). Provide normative constraints.

Let's craft final answer.

**Violating cases**

| Case ID | Why it deviates from the normative description |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| **2** | The activity **Package items** occurs **before** **Authorize payment**.  The text states that *“Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping.”*  Hence the required ordering \(\text{Authorize payment} \rightarrow \text{Package items}\) is broken. |
| **3** | After the **Cancel order** activity the process continues with **Ship order** (and then **Close order**).  The description explicitly says *“Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.”*  Therefore the sequence \(\text{Cancel order} \rightarrow \text{Ship order}\) violates the rule that cancellation ends the fulfillment‑related path. |
| **5** | The case skips the **Package items** step entirely and goes straight from **Authorize payment** to **Ship order**.  According to the normative flow, the ordering must be \(\text{Authorize payment} \rightarrow \text{Package items} \rightarrow \text{Ship order}\).  Omitting **Package items** breaches the constraint that *“Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping.”*  (No other rule is broken; the remaining activities follow the correct order.) |

**Explanation of each violation**

1. **Case 2 – premature packaging**  
   - **Normative rule:** “Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping.”  
   - **Observed order:** Receive → Check → **Package** → **Authorize** → Ship → Close.  
   - **Violation:** The activity **Package items** precedes **Authorize payment**, contradicting the required \(\text{Authorize payment} \rightarrow \text{Package items}\) ordering.

2. **Case 3 – shipping after cancellation**  
   - **Normative rule:** “Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.”  
   - **Observed order:** Receive → Check → Authorize → **Cancel** → **Ship** → Close.  
   - **Violation:** Once **Cancel order** is executed, no further fulfillment actions (Package, Ship) are permissible. The sequence \(\text{Cancel order} \rightarrow \text{Ship order}\) directly breaches this rule.

3. **Case 5 – missing packaging step**  
   - **Normative rule:** “Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping.”  
   - **Observed order:** Receive → Check → **Authorize** → **Ship** → Close (no Package).  
   - **Violation:** The required activity **Package items** is absent, so the process does not satisfy the mandated chain \(\text{Authorize payment} \rightarrow \text{Package items} \rightarrow \text{Ship order}\).  

**Cases that comply**

- **Case 1** follows the full “sufficient‑inventory” path: Receive → Check → Authorize → Package → Ship → Close.  
- **Case 4** follows the “insufficient‑inventory” path: Receive → Check → Cancel → Close.  

All deviations are identified by comparing the actual activity order with the constraints explicitly spelled out in the normative description, resolving any ambiguities by adhering to the most straightforward interpretation of the stated rules.
