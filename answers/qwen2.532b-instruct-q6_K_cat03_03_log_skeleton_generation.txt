To construct the Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process, we need to define the constraints based on the activities and their relationships as described. Here's how you can represent these constraints using the specified structure:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set([
        # No equivalence in this scenario.
    ]),
    'always_before': set([
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Check Availability always occurs after Receive Order.
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Reserve Items always occurs after Check Availability.
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Pick Items always occurs after Reserve Items.
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Quality Check always occurs after Pick Items.
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Pack Order always occurs after Quality Check.
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # Generate Shipping Label always occurs after Pack Order.
        ('GSL', 'D'),   # Dispatch always occurs after Generate Shipping Label.
    ]),
    'always_after': set([
        # No "Always After" constraints in this scenario as it generally implies
        # that something must happen at some point following another event,
        # but doesn't specify an immediate sequence which is already covered by
        # 'always_before' and 'directly_follows'.
    ]),
    'never_together': set([
        ('D', 'IC'),  # Dispatch cannot occur in the same case as Invoice Customer.
        ('RP', 'RO')   # Record Payment cannot occur in the same case as Receive Order.
    ]),
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},      # Receive Order must occur exactly once.
        'CA': {0, 1},   # Check Availability can occur 0 or 1 time.
        'RI': {0, 1},   # Reserve Items can occur 0 or 1 time.
        'PI': {0, 2},   # Pick Items can occur 0 to 2 times.
        'QC': {0, 3},   # Quality Check can occur 0 to 3 times.
        'PO': {1, 2},   # Pack Order must occur at least once and up to twice.
        'GSL': {1},     # Generate Shipping Label must occur exactly once.
        'D': {1},       # Dispatch must occur exactly once.
        'IC': {0, 1},   # Invoice Customer can occur 0 or 1 time.
        'RP': {1}       # Record Payment must occur exactly once.
    },
    'directly_follows': set([
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Directly after Receive Order is Check Availability.
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Directly after Check Availability is Reserve Items.
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Directly after Reserve Items is Pick Items.
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Directly after Pick Items is Quality Check.
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Directly after Quality Check is Pack Order.
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Directly after Pack Order is Generate Shipping Label.
        ('GSL', 'D')   # Directly after Generate Shipping Label is Dispatch.
    ])
}
```

This dictionary represents the Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process, including constraints that define the relationships between activities and their allowed occurrences.
