Sensitive attributes in data often refer to attributes that may be used to discriminate against individuals based on certain characteristics. These are characteristics such as race, gender, age, religion, disability, political affiliation, medical status, etc. In the context of this event log data, many of the attributes could potentially reveal sensitive information based on typical privacy and ethical data usage guidelines. Here are some sensitive attributes:

1. **case:citizen**: This could potentially reveal whether an individual is a citizen or not. Information about citizenship can be sensitive and may go into areas related to identity, eligibility for services, voting rights, and privacy in many jurisdictions.

2. **case:gender**: Gender is a sensitive attribute. It can influence fairness considerations, especially in contexts related to employment, educational opportunities, and services where gender-based discrimination might be an issue.

3. **case:german speaking**: Indicates whether an individual speaks German or not. This might be sensitive in contexts where services are culturally or linguistically tailored, potentially impacting privacy and the right to receive services without language barriers.

Understanding the sensitive attributes in this dataset helps to analyze whether procedures in the underlying processes (like loan application processes) adhere to fairness and equality principles. Actions like "skip examination" or "appointment denied" might potentially involve bias or discrimination if decisions are not uniformly applied across all races, genders, or nationalities. 

Ethical considerations should ensure that sensitive attributes are handled with appropriate levels of confidentiality and that analyses or processing of this information does not lead to discriminatory outcomes or decisions. Privacy laws and ethical guidelines should be followed when using such data.
