Okay, I need to model the telecom company's process using the POWL structure. Let me break down each step and see how to translate them into the Python code with the given classes. Let me start by understanding each part of the scenario and then map them into the appropriate nodes and their connections.

First, the process starts with the Service Request (SR) verification. Since the Contract Setup (CS) must come after SR verification, I think the SR is a mandatory step, but the problem statement says the process starts with verifying SR, then CS is done. But in the given structure, maybe the first nodes are SR and then CS? Wait, the first step says after verifying SR, CS must be done. So the first part is the SR is verified, then CS is a prerequisite. So the first steps are:

1. SR verification is an activity (Transition labeled "SR"), then CS must come next. But how to model that? Since CS must be done after SR, they are in sequence. Wait, the first part says the process starts with verifying SR, then CS must be done. So SR is followed by CS. Since these are two activities in sequence, maybe they form a partial order where SR is before CS. So the first nodes are SR and CS, connected in a partial order where SR must come before CS.

Wait, but the problem says "Once the request is verified: The Contract Setup (CS) must be done." So the SR verification is the first step, then CS comes after. So these two are sequential. So those two would be in a partial order where SR is before CS.

Then, after CS, the next step is the preparation of the network environment. This involves two parallel tasks: DA and ACI. These can be done in parallel, so they are in a partial order with no dependencies between them. So after CS comes the partial order of DA and ACI, but how to structure this?

Wait, the process after CS is that the next step is to perform DA and ACI in parallel. So the CS must be done before starting DA and ACI, and DA and ACI can be done concurrently. So the structure here is that CS is a predecessor of both DA and ACI. Then DA and ACI can be done in any order or concurrently as long as they come after CS. So the partial order here would have nodes DA and ACI, but with an order that CS must come before them. Hmm, perhaps the root of the overall process is a StrictPartialOrder that includes all the steps, but let's think in terms of the structure.

Wait, maybe the overall structure is built step by step. Let me outline each part step by step.

Let me outline the steps in the process as per the scenario:

1. Start with SR, then CS must come after SR.

2. After CS, DA and ACI can be done in parallel. So after CS is done, DA and ACI can start, but they can be done at the same time. The completion of both DA and ACI is needed before proceeding to the next phase.

3. Once DA and ACI are done, the process moves to the looped configuration phase. So after DA and ACI, the next step is the loop between BNC and D&R.

Wait, the loop is described as BNC followed by optional D&R, which repeats until configuration is stable. So the loop structure is a loop between A and B where A is BNC, and B is D&R? Wait, the loop operator in POWL is defined as * (A,B). So according to the problem's loop description: "a loop between the sub-models A and B is identified by * (A, B)". The loop works by executing A, then either exit, or do B and then A again. Wait, the operator LOOP is such that the loop is: execute A, then you can choose to exit, or execute B and then A again. Wait, the description says "execute A, then either you exit the loop, or execute B and then A again; this can happen multiple times until the loop is exited." So the structure is: A followed by (B followed by A) zero or more times? Or is it A followed by (optional B then A again). Hmm, the loop operator * (A,B) would mean that the loop is: execute A, then you can choose to exit, or execute B and then repeat the A again. Wait, no, the loop's structure is that after A, you can either exit or do B then A again. So the loop is structured such that you must do A, then either:

- exit (so the loop ends here)
- or do B followed by A again, then again choose to exit or repeat. 

Therefore, the loop (A,B) represents a loop where after each A, you can decide to continue by doing B and then A again, or exit. Wait, maybe I should check the description again: "execute A, then either you exit the loop, or execute B and then A again; this can happen multiple times until the loop is exited".

So the loop is A followed by (B followed by A) as many times as needed. The loop can exit at any point after A is done. So the loop node is * (A,B), where A is the first part and B is the second. So in the scenario, the loop here is between BNC and D&R. Wait, the problem says:

The loop is: "A base configuration activity BNC is done, followed by optional D&R if there are issues. This repeats until it's stable."

So the BNC is the first part (A), the first part of the loop), then D&R (B) is the part that can be repeated. Wait, but the loop is BNC followed by D&R, which may be repeated? Wait, the loop structure here is: you do BNC, then if issues are found, you do D&R, then repeat (BNC again?), or exit. Hmm, the problem says: "This (BNC followed by optional D&R) repeats until the configuration is stable." So the loop is that BNC is done, then if needed, D&R is done, then BNC again, etc., until it's stable. Wait, that might require the loop to be between BNC and D&R. So the loop node would be * (BNC, D&R). Because the loop is A (BNC) followed by B (D&R), and the loop repeats with A again? Because the loop operator's structure is that after A, you can choose to exit, or go to B and then A again. Wait, no, the description says that the loop is * (A,B) meaning that after A, you can exit, or do B and then A again. Wait, perhaps the loop is structured as: A is executed, then you can choose to either exit or go through B and then A again. So in this case, the BNC is A, and the optional D&R is B. Because the user wants to repeat BNC and D&R until it's stable. So each iteration is BNC followed by D&R (or not), then loop again? Hmm, perhaps the loop is structured so that each time after BNC, you can choose to do D&R (B) and then repeat the loop (so the loop continues), or exit. So the loop is between BNC (A) and D&R (B). So the loop node is * (BNC, D&R). So when the loop is entered, you first do BNC (A), then either exit, or do D&R (B) and then repeat (go back to A). So this would loop until they exit. That makes sense.

Then after the loop is exited, the next part is an exclusive choice between CD or MD (the deployment method).

After that, comes the QA and SA steps, which must be done in any order but after the choice, and then finally GLA.

So, putting this all together into the POWL structure:

Let me structure each part step by step.

First, the initial steps:

- Start with SR and CS in sequence. So those two are in a partial order where SR must come before CS. So they are in a partial order where SR is a predecessor to CS.

Wait, but how is the initial part modeled? The first part of the process is:

The process starts with verifying SR (SR activity), then CS must be done next. So SR is followed by CS. So these two are in a sequence. So they need to be in a partial order where SR must come before CS. So the first part is a strict partial order with nodes SR and CS, with an order edge from SR to CS.

Wait, but the first step is the process starts by verifying SR, then CS must be done. So the first two steps are sequential. So they are in a partial order with an order edge between them.

So the first part is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes [SR, CS], and an order edge SR --> CS.

Then, after CS comes the next phase (DA and ACI in parallel). So after CS is done, DA and ACI can be done in parallel. So the next step is that the next nodes (DA and ACI) must come after CS. So perhaps the next structure is a partial order where DA and ACI are in a partial order with no edges between them, but both have to come after CS.

Wait, but how to structure this in the code. Let me think in terms of building the structure step by step.

The overall structure is a series of steps connected via partial orders and operators. So the entire process is a hierarchy of these components.

Alternatively, the overall structure is built as a series of nested partial orders and operators.

Let's approach building the code step by step. Let me think of each part as sub-components.

First, let's list all the activities and their dependencies:

1. Start with SR and CS in sequence.

2. After CS, the next is DA and ACI in parallel. So those two are in parallel, but they can only start after CS is done.

3. After DA and ACI are both done, the loop phase begins. The loop is BNC followed by optional D&R, but repeated until stable. The loop is represented as a loop operator between BNC and D&R.

Wait, the loop is between BNC and D&R. So the loop is * (BNC, D&R). So the loop node is an OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP (Operator.L.OOP?), and children [BNC, D&R].

But according to the problem's loop description: After BNC, if there are issues, D&R is done, then BNC again? Or is the loop such that once you do BNC, you can choose to either exit or do D&R and then repeat BNC again? Let me check again: the problem states:

"the loop between the sub-models A and B is identified by * (A,B )" such that you execute A (BNC), then either exit or execute B (D&R) and then A again. So the loop is: execute A (BNC), then decide to exit, or do B (D&R) followed by A again, repeating until exit.

Thus, the loop is between BNC (A) and D&R (B). So the loop node is loop_config = OperatorPOWL(Operator.L.OOP, [BNC, D&R]).

Then after the loop, comes the exclusive choice between CD and MD.

Then after that, the QA and SA must be done in any order, but they must both be done before GLA. So QA and SA can be in parallel, but they must come after the deployment choice.

Finally, after both QA and SA are done, GLA comes last.

Putting this all together, the overall structure is a series of steps connected via partial orders.

Let me start building each component.

First, the initial steps:

- SR and CS are in a partial order with SR before CS.

Then, after that comes the DA and ACI in parallel. Since the next step requires that DA and ACI can be done in parallel, but after CS. So the DA and ACI are in a partial order with no edges between them, but both must come after CS.

Wait, how to model the transition from CS to the DA/ACI step. The CS must be completed before DA and ACI can start. So the CS must be a predecessor of both DA and ACI. So the next part after the initial steps is a partial order that includes DA and ACI, but with an order that requires that CS is done before DA and ACI can start. Wait, but how to structure this in the code. Maybe the overall structure is built as a series of partial orders and operators connected through higher-level partial orders.

Alternatively, the entire process is a StrictPartialOrder that includes all the steps, but the dependencies must be set with the order edges.

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to build the structure step by step, creating the necessary nodes and linking them via partial orders.

Alternatively, the process can be built as a hierarchy where each step is a sub-component.

Let me think of building the code step by step.

First, the first two steps (SR and CS) are in a sequence. So they form a StrictPartialOrder with nodes [SR, CS], and an order edge from SR to CS.

Then, after that, the next step is the parallel DA and ACI. So after the first partial order (SR and CS), the next step is the parallel DA and ACI. But how to structure this? The first partial order (SR and CS) must come before the next phase (DA and ACI). So perhaps the first part is the initial partial order (SR -> CS), and then the next step is DA and ACI in parallel, which must come after the completion of the initial partial order.

Wait, perhaps the entire process is structured as a sequence of partial orders and operators connected via a larger partial order.

Alternatively, the overall structure can be built as a series of components linked via partial orders.

Alternatively, let's consider that each phase is a node in a higher-level partial order.

Perhaps the entire process is a StrictPartialOrder that contains all the nodes, but with the correct dependencies.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire process can be built as a hierarchy of partial orders and operators.

Let me start coding step by step.

First, define the activities as Transition objects:

SR = Transition("SR")

CS = Transition("CS")

DA = Transition("DA")

ACI = Transition("ACI")

BNC = Transition("BNC")

DR = Transition("D&R")  (Wait, the problem uses D&R as the label? The problem says "Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)". So the label is "D&R".

Then the exclusive choice between CD and MD:

CD = Transition("CD")

MD = Transition("MD"

QA = Transition("QA")

SA = Transition("SA"

GLA = Transition("GLA")

Now, the steps:

1. The first step is the sequence SR -> CS. This is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes [SR, CS], connected with an edge from SR to CS.

2. After that, DA and ACI are in parallel. Since these can be done in parallel, their partial order has no edges between them, but they must come after CS. Wait, but how to model the transition from the initial sequence to the next phase.

Hmm, perhaps the first part (SR and CS) is one node, and the next part (DA and ACI in parallel) is another node, and the loop, then the XOR, then QA and SA, then GLA.

Alternatively, perhaps each phase is a node in a higher-level partial order, with dependencies between them.

Alternatively, the entire process can be represented as a StrictPartialOrder where each major phase is a node, and dependencies between the phases are set via order edges.

Wait, but some phases are themselves composed of internal structures (like the loop and the XOR).

Alternatively, let's start building the components step by step.

First, the first part: the initial steps (SR and CS in sequence):

initial_sequence = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])

initial_sequence.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # So SR must come before CS.

Then, the next step is the parallel DA and ACI. So after the initial_sequence, the next phase is the parallel DA and ACI.

Wait, but how to model the transition from the initial_sequence to the next part.

Wait, perhaps the next part (DA and ACI in parallel) is represented as their own partial order where DA and ACI have no order between them. So:

parallel_DA_ACI = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

Then, the initial_sequence must be before this parallel step, so in the overall structure, initial_sequence must come before parallel_DA_ACI.

But how to represent the entire process as a tree of nodes.

Alternatively, the entire process is a StrictPartialOrder that includes all these components, but connected appropriately.

Alternatively, maybe the process is built by creating each part as a node and linking them via partial orders.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire process is built as a StrictPartialOrder that contains all the necessary elements, with the correct order dependencies between them.

Alternatively, the process can be built as a tree of nodes. Let's think of the components:

The first component is the initial_sequence (SR -> CS).

Then, after that comes the parallel DA/ACI.

Then, after that comes the loop phase (BNC and D&R loop).

Wait, after DA and ACI are done, then comes the loop phase. So the loop is after the DA/ACI steps.

Wait, step 3 says: "Once DA and ACI are both completed, the process moves to a looped configuration phase".

Thus, the loop must come after both DA and ACI have completed. Since DA and ACI are in parallel (the parallel DA/ACI partial order), so their completion signifies moving to the next phase.

Therefore, the loop node comes after the parallel DA/ACI is done.

So the loop is the next step after DA and ACI are done.

Then, after the loop (which is the configuration phase), comes the exclusive choice between CD and MD.

Then, after that comes the QA and SA in any order, then GLA.

Wait, but the loop is part of the configuration phase, so once the loop is done, then comes the deployment choice.

Let me try to outline the main components:

Main structure outline:

1. Start with the initial steps: SR and CS in sequence (node1).

2. Then the parallel DA and ACI (node2).

3. Then the loop (BNC and D&R) (node3).

4. Then the XOR between CD and MD (node4).

5. Then the QA and SA in any order (node5).

6. Then GLA (node6).

These nodes (node1 to node6) are connected in sequence: node1 must come before node2, node2 before node3, etc., except node5 comes after node4, and node6 after node5.

Wait, but this may not be accurate. Let me see:

The steps are:

1. After initial_sequence (SR and CS), the next is DA and ACI in parallel (step 2).

2. Then the loop (step3) occurs after DA and ACI are done.

3. After the loop, the exclusive choice (step4).

4. After the choice, the QA and SA (step5) must be done in any order, but both must be done before GLA (step6).

Therefore, the nodes need to form a chain where each phase must come after the previous. So the nodes would be:

Each major phase is a node in the overall Partial Order.

Let me try to model each part as a node:

- The first part is the initial_sequence (SR -> CS).

- The second part is the parallel DA and ACI (parallel_DA_ACI).

- The third part is the loop (loop_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.L.OOP, [BNC, D&R]).

- The fourth part is the XOR between CD and MD (xor_node = OperatorPOWL with Operator.XOR and children [CD, MD].

- The fifth part is the QA and SA in parallel (so a partial order with QA and SA, with no order between them, but they must come after the XOR.

- The sixth part is GLA, which comes after QA and SA.

So the overall structure would have the nodes as these components, connected in sequence with dependencies.

So, the nodes in the main StrictPartialOrder would be:

initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_parallel, GLA.

Wait, but the loop_node is an OperatorPOWL (the loop operator between BNC and D&R), so that's a node in the overall structure.

Wait, but the loop itself is an operator node (OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP). So the loop_node is a single node representing the loop.

Similarly, the xor is a node (OperatorPOWL with XOR operator and children CD and MD).

The QA and SA are in a parallel partial order, so that's a StrictPartialOrder node with QA and SA, no order between them.

Then, the main structure is a StrictPartialOrder that includes all these nodes, with edges indicating the sequence.

Wait, perhaps the overall structure is a StrictPartialOrder with all the components (initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, GLA), and the edges between them.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me try to structure this step by step.

Let me think of building the components step by step.

First, let's create the initial sequence (SR and CS):

initial_sequence = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])

initial_sequence.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # SR must come before CS.

Next, the parallel DA and ACI:

parallel_DA_ACI = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

These two nodes have no order between them, so no edges in their own partial order, but they must come after the initial_sequence. So the initial_sequence must be before parallel_DA_ACI. But how to connect them in the overall structure.

Hmm, perhaps the next part is that the initial_sequence must be a predecessor of parallel_DA_ACI. So the overall structure will have an edge from initial_sequence to parallel_DA_ACI.

Then, after the parallel DA and ACI, comes the loop_node (the loop between BNC and D&R).

The loop is an OperatorPOWL with Operator.L.OOP, children BNC and DR (the D&R activity).

Wait, the loop is created as:

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.L.OOP, children=[BNC, DR]

Wait, the loop operator is Operator.L.OOP (Loop). So:

from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator. So Operator.L.OOP would be Operator.L.OOP (but I need to check the exact name. The problem says Operator.XOR and Operator.L.OOP.

Wait, in the code example, the loop is created with Operator.L.OOP. So the loop operator is Operator.L.OOP, which in the code would be Operator.L.OOP.

So the loop_node is:

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.L.OOP, [BNC, DR]

Then, after the loop comes the exclusive choice between CD and MD. The XOR node is:

xor_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [CD, MD]

Then, after that comes QA and SA in parallel. So that's another partial order with QA and SA having no order between them:

qa_sa_partial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA]

Then finally, GLA comes after that.

Now, putting all these components into the overall structure.

The main structure is a StrictPartialOrder containing all these components, with dependencies:

initial_sequence must be before parallel_DA_ACI.

parallel_DA_ACI must be before loop_node.

loop_node before xor_node.

xor_node before qa_sa_partial_order.

qa_sa_partial_order before GLA.

But the loop_node is the loop between BNC and D&R, so that's a single node (OperatorPOWL).

Wait, but the loop_node itself is an OperatorPOWL node (the loop operator), so that's a single node in the higher-level structure.

Wait, perhaps the entire process is built as a StrictPartialOrder that includes all these nodes (initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, and GLA), with edges between them.

Wait, but the main root is a StrictPartialOrder with all these nodes as its children, and order edges between them.

So the main root's nodes would be:

initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, GLA.

Edges would be:

initial_sequence must come before parallel_DA_ACI.

parallel_DA_ACI must come before loop_node.

loop_node before xor_node.

xor_node before qa_sa_partial_order.

qa_sa_partial_order before GLA.

Additionally, the loop_node itself is the loop between BNC and DR (BNC and D&R).

Wait, but the loop_node is a single node (OperatorPOWL) in the main structure.

Wait, perhaps the loop_node is part of the main StrictPartialOrder's nodes, and the edges between the nodes are as above.

Wait, but the main root is the root of the entire process, so let's see:

The main structure (root) is a StrictPartialOrder containing all the major components. Let me try to outline:

root = StrictPartialOrder(

root's nodes would include:

- initial_sequence (the SR and CS partial order),

- parallel_DA_ACI,

- loop_node (the loop operator node),

- xor_node (the CD vs MD choice),

- qa_sa_partial_order,

- GLA (Transition node, but GLA is an activity (Transition), so it's a node in the main structure? Wait, GLA is a single activity, so it's a Transition.

Wait, but the qa_sa_partial_order is a node (a StrictPartialOrder node), and GLA is a Transition node.

Hmm, perhaps the main root will have nodes like:

initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, and GLA.

But the loop_node is the loop between BNC and DR, so that is an OperatorPOWL node.

The xor_node is an OperatorPOWL for the choice between CD and MD.

QA and SA are in a partial order (their own StrictPartialOrder node), which is part of the main root's nodes.

So the structure would be:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, GLA])

Then, the dependencies:

root.order.add_edge(initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI)

root.order.add_edge(parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node)

root.order.add_edge(loop_node, xor_node)

root.order.add_edge(xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order)

root.order.add_edge(qa_sa_partial_order, GLA)

Wait, but the QA and SA are a partial order (qa_sa_partial_order), which is a node, so the edge between xor_node and qa_sa_partial_order would mean that the xor_node must come before qa_sa_partial_order.

Yes.

Additionally, the loop_node's loop structure is already handled by its operator (the loop operator between BNC and DR).

The parallel_DA_ACI node is a StrictPartialOrder where DA and ACI can be in parallel.

Now, the loop_node is the loop between BNC and D&R. So the loop_node is an OperatorPOWL(Operator.L.OOP, [BNC, D&R]).

Wait, the loop is * (A,B where A is the first part and B is the second part. The problem's loop description says the loop is BNC followed by optional D&R, then repeat until stable. The loop operator requires the loop to be * (A,B), so the loop_node is OperatorPOWL(Operator.L.OOP, [BNC, DR].

Wait, the first child is A (BNC), the second is B (DR). So the loop is BNC followed by (D&R and then BNC again, etc.

Yes, the loop is structured such that you do BNC (the first child), then you can choose to exit or do the second child (DR) and then repeat.

Wait, according to the operator definition, the loop allows after executing A (BNC), you can choose to exit, or execute B (DR) then A again. Wait, no, the problem says the loop is * (A,B) "execute A, then either you exit the loop, or execute B and then A again".

Wait, the loop's children are [A, B], so after A, you can choose to exit or do B then A again. So in the case of the loop, the loop is entered, you do A, then choose to exit, or do B then A again.

Wait, the loop's structure is such that the first part is A (BNC), then the second part is B (D&R). So the loop is BNC followed by optional D&R and then repeat.

So the loop is the loop_node:

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.L.OOP, [BNC, DR])

Proceeding:

After the loop comes the XOR between CD and MD:

xor_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [CD, MD]

Then the qa_sa_partial_order is a partial order of QA and SA with no order between them (so their partial order has no edges between them, so they can be in parallel).

qa_sa_partial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA]

Then the GLA is a single Transition node.

Putting it all together, the main root would have all these components as nodes, connected in sequence.

But I need to create all of these components first, then build the main structure.

Now, putting all these into code.

Now, the next part is the loop between BNC and D&R. The loop_node is an OperatorPOWL with the two activities.

Then, the exclusive choice between CD and MD: that's another OperatorPOWL with XOR operator.

Now, the next part is the QA and SA in parallel: that's another StrictPartialOrder with QA and SA nodes, with no edges between them.

Now, the GLA is a single Transition.

Now, putting all these into a main root.

Wait, perhaps the main root is a StrictPartialOrder with all the major steps as nodes:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes = [initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, GLA]

Then, adding the order edges between them:

root.order.add_edge(initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI)  # after initial_sequence comes before parallel_DA_ACI

root.order.add_edge(parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node)

root.order.add_edge(loop_node, xor_node)

root.order.add_edge(xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order)

root.order.add_edge(qa_sa_partial_order, GLA)

Wait, but also, the loop_node comes after the parallel_DA_ACI is done, which comes after the initial_sequence.

Yes.

Now, the main root would be the StrictPartialOrder with all these nodes and their dependencies.

Wait, but the parallel_DA_ACI node is a StrictPartialOrder with DA and ACI in parallel. That's correct.

So, the parallel_DA_ACI is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes DA and ACI (no edges between them, since they can be done in parallel).

Now, the loop_node's children are BNC and DR (the loop operator between them).

Then, after the loop comes the XOR between CD and MD.

Wait, but after the loop (which is the loop_node), then the next is the xor_node.

Then, after that comes the QA and SA in parallel (qa_sa_partial_order node), which is a StrictPartialOrder of QA and SA.

Then, after that comes GLA.

This seems to fit.

Now, proceeding to code.

Now, let's code this step by step.

First, import the required classes:

from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition

from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator  # for Operator.XOR and Operator.L.OOP.

Now, create the individual transitions:

SR = Transition("SR")

CS = Transition("CS"

DA = Transition("DA")

ACI = Transition("ACI"

BNC = Transition("BNC"

DR = Transition("D&R"  # The name is "D&R".

CD = Transition("CD"

MD = Transition("MD"

QA = Transition("QA"

SA = Transition("SA"

GLA = Transition("GLA"

Now, create the initial_sequence:

initial_sequence = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])

initial_sequence.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # SR must be before CS.

Then, the parallel_DA_ACI is a partial order with DA and ACI, with no edges between them:

parallel_DA_ACI = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI]

Wait, DA and ACI are the nodes. So:

parallel_DA_ACI = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI]

Wait, the nodes are DA and ACI, and their partial order has no edges between them.

Next, the loop_node is an OperatorPOWL with Operator.L.OOP and children BNC and D&R:

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.L.OOP, [BNC, DR]

Then, the XOR between CD and MD is:

xor_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [CD, MD]

Then, the qa_sa_partial_order is a StrictPartialOrder with QA and SA:

qa_sa_partial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA]

Now, the GLA is just a Transition.

Now, the main root is a StrictPartialOrder containing all these components:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, GLA]

Wait, but GLA is a Transition, not a node. Wait, no, GLA is a Transition, so it's a node in the root's nodes.

Wait, the root's nodes are the components:

Wait, the root is the main StrictPartialOrder that includes all the major steps as its nodes.

Wait, the initial_sequence is a StrictPartialOrder node, and parallel_DA_ACI is another StrictPartialOrder node, etc.

Wait, but the loop_node is an OperatorPOWL (a node in the main root's nodes.

So, the nodes in the root are:

initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, GLA (since GLA is a single activity).

Wait, but GLA is a Transition (a node in the main root's nodes).

Wait, but the qa_sa_partial_order is a StrictPartialOrder with QA and SA as its nodes. So in the main root's nodes, the qa_sa_partial_order is one node, and then the GLA must come after that.

So the main root's nodes are:

- initial_sequence (StrictPartialOrder node),

- parallel_DA_ACI (StrictPartialOrder node),

- loop_node (OperatorPOWL node),

- xor_node (OperatorPOWL node),

- qa_sa_partial_order (StrictPartialOrder node),

- GLA (Transition node).

Wait, but GLA is a single activity, so in the root's nodes, it's a Transition. But in the main root, the nodes can be any of the nodes (could be Operators, Transitions, or other StrictPartialOrders.

Now, the main root's edges are:

- initial_sequence must come before parallel_DA_ACI.

- parallel_DA_ACI must come before loop_node.

- loop_node before xor_node.

- xor_node before qa_sa_partial_order.

- qa_sa_partial_order before GLA.

Wait, and also, the loop_node must come after the parallel_DA_ACI's completion. Because after DA and ACI are done, the loop can start.

Yes.

Now, putting all these into code.

Wait, but the loop_node is the loop between BNC and DR.

Now, putting all this into code.

Wait, also the code would look something like this:

# Define all transitions:

SR = Transition(label="SR")

CS = Transition(label="CS")

DA = Transition("DA")

ACI = Transition("ACI")

BNC = Transition("BNC")

DR = Transition("D&R")

CD = Transition("CD")

MD = Transition("MD")

QA = Transition("QA")

SA = Transition("SA")

GLA = Transition("GLA")

# Build the initial_sequence (SR -> CS):

initial_sequence = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])

initial_sequence.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

Wait, but in the code, the variables are SR and CS. So the code is:

initial_sequence = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])

initial_sequence.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

Wait, but in code, the first argument is the source, then target. So yes.

Next, parallel_DA_ACI:

parallel_DA_ACI = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

# No edges between DA and ACI.

# So that's done.

Then, loop_node:

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.L.OOP, children=[BNC, DR])

Wait, the loop is * (BNC, D&R), so the children are [BNC, DR].

Yes.

Then the xor_node:

xor_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

Then, qa_sa_partial_order:

qa_sa_partial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA]

# no edges between QA and SA.

Then, the GLA is a single Transition node.

Now, the main root is a StrictPartialOrder containing all these components.

Wait, but the loop_node is a node in the main root's nodes, as is the xor_node, etc.

Wait, the main root's nodes would be:

nodes_list = [initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, GLA]

Wait, but GLA is a Transition, so it's added as a node in the root's nodes.

Wait, but in the main StrictPartialOrder (root), the nodes are:

initial_sequence (a StrictPartialOrder), 

parallel_DA_ACI (another StrictPartialOrder),

loop_node (OperatorPOWL),

xor_node (OperatorPOWL),

qa_sa_partial_order (StrictPartialOrder),

and GLA (Transition).

Wait, but GLA is a single node, so in the root's nodes, GLA is a Transition, so that's okay.

Then, adding the edges between them:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, GLA]

Then, adding the edges:

root.order.add_edge(initial_sequence, parallel_DA_ACI)

root.order.add_edge(parallel_DA_A
