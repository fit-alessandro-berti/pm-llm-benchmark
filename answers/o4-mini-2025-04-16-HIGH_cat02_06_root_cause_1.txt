1. Cases with unusually long resolution times  
   • Case 102: ~25 h 10 m (2024-03-01 08:05 to 03-02 09:15)  
   • Case 104: ~24 h 10 m (2024-03-01 08:20 to 03-02 08:30)  
   • Case 105: ~49 h 05 m (2024-03-01 08:25 to 03-03 09:30)  

   By contrast, non-escalated cases 101 and 103 closed within 1–2 hours.

2. Key bottlenecks and root causes  
   a) Escalations to Level-2  
     – Cases 102 and 105 both “Escalate to Level-2 Agent,” introducing long wait times before the next “Investigate Issue.”  
     – Case 102 waits ~2 ½ h (11:3014:00 same day) then a further overnight gap to resolution.  
     – Case 105 sits ~28 h before L2 even begins investigation.  
      Lack of immediate specialist availability and hand-off delays.  

   b) Cross-shift and end-of-day delays  
     – Case 104 (no escalation) completes “Investigate Issue” at 13:00 then doesn’t resolve until 08:00 next day, adding ~19 h of idle time.  
     – Even for escalated Case 102, resolution only occurs the next morning.  
      Work queued overnight or across weekend days, awaiting next shift.  

   c) Weekend/after-hours processing  
     – Case 105 spans a Friday escalation through Saturday investigation to Sunday resolution, compounding delays.  
      L2 team appears to process escalations only during limited business hours or select weekend slots.  

3. How these factors inflate cycle time  
   – Every escalation hand-off adds substantial waiting time before the specialist investigation can begin.  
   – Tasks completed after the primary shift often sit idle until the next business period (overnight or weekend).  
   – Lack of 24/7 or overlapping coverage for Level-2 work means escalated tickets back-up.  

4. Recommendations to reduce delays  
   • Strengthen escalation hand-off  
     – Define strict SLAs for Level-2 pickup (e.g. begin investigation within X hours of escalation).  
     – Automate alerts/queuing to ensure immediate visibility for L2 agents.  

   • Extend or overlap specialist coverage  
     – Introduce staggered shifts or on-call rotations so escalations aren’t forced to wait until the next business window.  
     – Evaluate weekend staffing for critical escalations.  

   • Optimize cross-shift workflows  
     – Allow resolution tasks to be actioned in the afternoon rather than queuing overnight.  
     – Implement “follow-the-ticket” responsibility or shorter hand-off windows between shifts.  

   • Prevent unnecessary escalations  
     – Enhance L1 training or empower agents with more diagnostic tools to resolve borderline issues without hand-off.  
     – Introduce a “fast-track” lane for high-priority tickets.  

By addressing specialist availability, reducing hand-off latency, and smoothing cross-shift processing, the organization can cut the 24–49 hour outliers down toward the 1–3 hour norm seen in non-escalated cases.
