Summary of where bias shows up
- Attributes driving preferential treatment: LocalResident and CommunityGroup (specifically, “Highland Civic Darts Club”).
- Mechanism: A systematic +10 score boost is applied to members of that community group. Final approvals also appear to use different effective cutoffs depending on locality/community status.

Evidence from the log
- Group-based score boost: Only applicants tied to the named club receive +10 at PreliminaryScoring (C001, C004). No other applicants receive any positive adjustment.
- Different effective thresholds:
  - A local club member with 700 adjusted score (C004) is approved.
  - A non-local with a higher score of 715 (C003) is rejected.
  - This is consistent with a lower approval threshold for local/club-affiliated applicants and a higher threshold for others.
- Approval rates by locality:
  - Local residents: 3/3 approved (100%).
  - Non-locals: 1/2 approved (50%).
  - Disparate impact ratio (non-local vs local)  0.50, below the common 0.80 “four-fifths” benchmark.
- Approved score levels differ by group:
  - Lowest adjusted score approved among locals: 700 (C004).
  - Lowest adjusted score approved among non-locals: 740 (C005).
  - Average adjusted score of approved locals  713 vs approved non-locals = 740, indicating locals are accepted at materially lower scores.
- Counterfactual effect of the community bonus:
  - C001 would likely be below a 720-type threshold without the +10 (710  720).
  - C004’s approval at 700 vs a non-local rejection at 715 highlights outcome flips driven by affiliation, not underlying score.

Why this matters for fairness and equity
- Unequal access for similar creditworthiness: Applicants lacking the specific community affiliation or local status face a higher bar, even when their scores are comparable.
- Embedded “insider advantage”: The named club’s bonus functions like a whitelist; people outside that network (especially non-locals) are disadvantaged at the decision margin.
- Geographic proxy risk: LocalResident and a geographically bound club may act as proxies for socioeconomic or demographic factors, creating disparate impact even if not intended.
- Automation amplifies the effect: Final decisions are made by a Rules Engine; codified rules can consistently disadvantage out-group applicants.

What to consider changing
- Remove or strictly justify the community bonus: Keep it only if there is strong, audited evidence that this affiliation independently reduces risk; otherwise, drop it.
- Make any “social support” benefit group-agnostic: If community backing matters, encode it as a formal, verifiable risk mitigant (e.g., co-signer, guarantee), available to any applicant, not a specific club.
- Harmonize thresholds: Use a single score cutoff (or a calibrated probability-of-default threshold) that does not depend on locality or affiliation.
- Audit regularly:
  - Track approval rates and score cutoffs by LocalResident and CommunityGroup across score bands.
  - Apply disparate impact checks (e.g., 80% rule) and counterfactual tests (flip the attribute and recompute decisions).
- Provide equitable recourse: Offer non-locals a path to the same +10 via equivalent documentation of support or risk reduction.
