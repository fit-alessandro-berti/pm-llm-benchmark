Here’s what jumps out from the five cases:  

1. A “+10” bonus is applied only to applicants who both live in the local area (LocalResident=TRUE) and belong to the “Highland Civic Darts Club.”  
   - C001 (raw 710)  +10  720  Approved  
   - C004 (raw 690)  +10  700  Approved  
   Nobody else ever gets that +10.  

2. Non-locals and people with no community affiliation get no boost—and in at least one case (C003) they lose out despite having a perfectly good raw score.  
   - C003 is non-local, no club, raw 715  no adjustment  Rejected  
   - C001 is local, club member, raw 710  +10  Approved  

   Even though 715>710, C003 is rejected and C001 is approved.  

3. Thresholds appear to be applied unevenly  
   - All locals with final  700 go through.  
   - Non-locals only sail through if they clear some higher bar (C005 at 740 is approved, but C003 at 715 is rejected).  
   ­– This effectively means non-locals need a much higher score than locals.  

4. Manual review never counterbalances the bias  
   - Every case hits an underwriter, but none of the non-locals ever “earn” an adjustment.  
   - Reviewers simply rubber-stamp the automated +10 for locals and never question it.  

Taken together, the process privileges people with:  
 • Local residency  
 • Membership in a specific civic club  

Those privileges can push marginal applicants above the cutoff (or let very strong non-locals squeak through), while otherwise-identical non-locals or folks without social-club ties get stuck at a higher effective bar.  

Fairness implications:  
 • Socio-economic or demographic groups that can’t easily join that one civic club (student renters, recent arrivals, minority groups, etc.) are systematically penalized.  
 • Geographic discrimination: out-of-towners—even credit-worthy ones—face an uphill score gap.  
 • Lack of transparency: neither applicants nor underwriters ever see or justify these unbalanced bonuses, so there’s no real appeal path.  

If your goal is equitable lending, you’d want to:  
 • Eliminate or audit the “+10 community” bonus (or open it up to a broad, non-discriminatory list of affiliations).  
 • Apply the same score cutoff to everyone, regardless of zip code or club membership.  
 • Build in fairness checks (e.g. measure approval rates by geography and affiliation, look for disparate impact).  

Only then can you be confident that two people with the same underlying risk aren’t being treated very differently just because one happens to live in Highland and play darts on Thursday nights.
