1. Problems in the current model  
• Everything from “Create Purchase Order” up to “Pay Invoice” is put in one big PARALLEL-block.  
  – This lets the five activities fire in ANY order or even simultaneously.  
  – Domain violations that are therefore possible:
    • “Pay Invoice” can be executed before “Receive Invoice”, “Receive Goods”, or “Match Invoice to PO”.  
    • “Match Invoice to PO” can run before either goods or invoice have been received.  
    • “Create Purchase Order” could be postponed until after the goods are already in-house – clearly wrong.  
• “Close Case” is the only step that is protected by sequence; every other domain rule is broken.

Strict / sequential parts that must not be parallel:  
– Create_Purchase_Requisition  Approve_Purchase_Requisition  Create_Purchase_Order must always be in this order.  
– Match_Invoice_to_PO must only start after BOTH Receive_Goods and Receive_Invoice are finished.  
– Pay_Invoice must only occur after the match is completed.  
– Close_Case must be the very last activity.

Only the arrival of the goods and the arrival of the supplier’s invoice are truly order-independent in a classic P2P process – they may come in either order, but both must be present before matching.

2. Corrected process tree model (Python pseudocode)

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Leaf nodes (unchanged)
create_req      = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req     = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po       = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods   = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice   = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice     = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case      = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

#  Parallel block that ONLY covers the two order-independent arrivals
goods_and_invoice = ProcessTree(
    operator=Operator.PARALLEL,        # AND–block
    children=[receive_goods, receive_invoice]
)

#  Full, domain-compliant root sequence
root = ProcessTree(
    operator=Operator.SEQUENCE,
    children=[
        create_req,          # 1
        approve_req,         # 2
        create_po,           # 3
        goods_and_invoice,   # 4 + 5  (order free, but both required)
        match_invoice,       # 6
        pay_invoice,         # 7
        close_case           # 8
    ]
)
```

3. Why the updated tree is conformant

• Steps 1-3: A strict SEQUENCE makes it impossible to raise a purchase order before the requisition is created and approved.

• Steps 4-5: A small AND-block states “both goods and invoice must be performed, in any order, once each, and can run concurrently”.  
  – Because the AND is nested inside the outer SEQUENCE, the model still forbids any later activity from starting until both have completed.

• Step 6: “Match Invoice to PO” is placed after the AND-block, guaranteeing that matching can only occur when both pre-conditions (goods and invoice) are satisfied.

• Step 7: “Pay Invoice” can only start after the match is complete, ruling out premature payments.

• Step 8: “Close Case” remains the unchangeable final step.

As a consequence, every trace that the fixed process tree allows corresponds to an admissible, business-sensible procure-to-pay execution; any trace that violates the mandated order (e.g., paying first, receiving nothing, matching too early, etc.) is now impossible.
