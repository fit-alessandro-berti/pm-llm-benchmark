Below is a list of 20 potential questions that could be relevant for analyzing and improving this process. Each question is followed by a proposed confidence score (on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is highest confidence that this question is relevant and valuable).

1. **At which step(s) are declarations most frequently rejected, and what are the common reasons for these rejections?** (Confidence: 10)  
2. **How does the involvement of different approval roles (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR) impact the overall lead time of the process?** (Confidence: 10)  
3. **What is the correlation between the number of re-submissions (after a rejection) and the total performance time (i.e., cycle time) of the process?** (Confidence: 9)  
4. **Are there specific steps that consistently lead to longer performance times, and can they be streamlined or partially automated?** (Confidence: 9)  
5. **How does the frequency and timing of involvement by the SUPERVISOR affect the final outcome and timeliness of payment handling?** (Confidence: 8)  
6. **What is the average time saved when a declaration is approved on the first submission versus cases that involve multiple rejection and re-submission cycles?** (Confidence: 9)  
7. **Which role (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER) introduces the longest delays in the process, and what are potential causes?** (Confidence: 9)  
8. **How often do declarations remain in the 'SAVED by EMPLOYEE' state without being submitted, and what might this indicate about the employeeâ€™s experience or process clarity?** (Confidence: 8)  
9. **Does the complexity of the approval chain (e.g., the number of approvers involved) correlate with a higher likelihood of rejections?** (Confidence: 8)  
10. **For declarations that are ultimately paid, which variant pattern (approval route) leads to the shortest overall cycle time?** (Confidence: 10)  
11. **Are there patterns in which certain submitters (EMPLOYEEs) or certain categories of requests are more likely to be rejected multiple times?** (Confidence: 8)  
12. **How does the "REJECTED by MISSING" activity factor into the process, and can it be prevented or clarified to reduce confusion and rework?** (Confidence: 7)  
13. **Is there a relationship between the initial quality of the submitted declaration (completeness, correctness) and the number of subsequent rejections and delays?** (Confidence: 9)  
14. **Does the process differ significantly in performance if the BUDGET OWNER approves early versus when the declaration goes directly to the SUPERVISOR for final approval?** (Confidence: 8)  
15. **Is there a threshold frequency of rejections after which the likelihood of eventual successful payment handling drastically decreases, and what does this imply?** (Confidence: 8)  
16. **Are certain steps redundant or rarely executed (e.g., REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER sequences) that can be removed or combined to streamline the process?** (Confidence: 9)  
17. **How does the performance time differ for declarations handled straightforwardly (few steps) versus those that cycle multiple times between REJECTED and SUBMITTED states?** (Confidence: 10)  
18. **Does the process outcome and performance improve if certain decision points (like ADMINISTRATION approval) happen earlier or later in the sequence?** (Confidence: 7)  
19. **What is the cost implication (in terms of time and labor) of repeated rejections and multiple rounds of approvals on overall resource utilization?** (Confidence: 9)  
20. **Could introducing automated checks or guided input forms at the submission stage reduce the number of rejections and thus improve overall performance?** (Confidence: 10)
