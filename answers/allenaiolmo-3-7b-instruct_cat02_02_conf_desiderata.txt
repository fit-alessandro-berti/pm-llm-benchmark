Let's analyze the event logs and compare them to the **normative process rules** and the **desiderata** as described.

---

## 1. **Normative Rule Violations (Strict Rules)**

We must look for any instances where the process deviates from the **strict sequence and ordering rules**.

### **Key Normative Sequence (from Part 1):**

1. Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  
   - If Approved: Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
   - If Rejected: Close Case (no finalization)

Let's go through each case:

---

### **Case 1**
| 1 | Received | Credit Check | Risk Assessment | Loan Decision (Approved) | Inform Applicant | Finalize Doc | Close Case |
|----|-----------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| Yes – all in correct order.  
  - Credit Check before Risk Assessment  
  - Decision before Inform Applicant  
  - Finalize Doc only after Approval & before Close  
No violations of strict rules. 

---

### **Case 2**
| 2 | Received | Risk Assessment (at 08:20) | Credit Check (at 08:20?)  
Wait, let's reorder by timestamp:

| 2 | 08:00 Application  
| 2 | 08:20 Risk Assessment  
| 2 | 08:20 Credit Check *(but same timestamp? Let's assume correct order from the logs as presented)*  
Wait, the log shows:
- 08:20: Risk Assessment
- 08:20: Credit Check *(but that's ambiguous; typically, they should be sequential. Let's assume the order in the table is the order performed unless noted)*

But as written in the log:
1. 08:00: Application
2. 08:20: Risk Assessment
3. 08:20: Credit Check *(impossible; likely a typo or out of order)*

But the next entry is 08:30: Credit Check.

Wait, let's look at the actual entries in order:

| 2 | 08:00: Application Received  
| 2 | 08:20: Risk Assessment  
| 2 | 08:20: Credit Check *(duplicate time, likely a mistake in log formatting)*  
| 2 | 08:30: Credit Check *(so actually, Credit Check at 08:30)*

But in the sequence, Credit Check must come **before** Risk Assessment per the normative rules!

But in the log, Risk Assessment is at 08:20, then Credit Check at 08:30 — so Credit Check occurs **after** Risk Assessment.  
That’s a **violation** of the ordering rule: "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."

Also, the decision is at 09:00 (Loan Decision Rejected), then Finalize Documentation at 10:00 — but after a rejected loan, finalization should **not** occur before closing. So, Finalize Documentation at 10:00 is another violation (even though closing is at 10:30, the documentation is finalized after the rejection).

**Summary of Violations in Case 2:**
- Credit Check performed after Risk Assessment (should be before).
- Finalized documentation after a rejected loan (not allowed).

### **Case 3**
| 3 | 09:00 Application  
| 3 | 14:00 Credit Check *(24 hours after received – this is a desideratum, not a normative rule)*  
| 3 | 14:00 Risk Assessment  
| 3 | 12:00 Loan Decision (Approved) *(Wait, timestamp is 12:00, but Risk Assessment was at 14:00? That can't be unless the log is out of order)*

Wait, let's reorder by timestamp:

| 3 | 09:00 Application  
| 3 | 14:00 Credit Check  
| 3 | 14:00 Risk Assessment *(same time, assume order is correct)*  
| 3 | 12:00 Loan Decision — but 12:00 is before 14:00! This is inconsistent.

Wait the log says:

| 3 | 09:00 Application  
| 3 | 14:00 Credit Check  
| 3 | 14:00 Risk Assessment  
| 3 | 12:00 Loan Decision *(this must be a typo — maybe 14:00?)*  
| 3 | 16:00 Inform Applicant  
| 3 | 17:00 Finalize Documentation  
| 3 | 17:00 Close Case  

Assuming the Loan Decision is at 14:00 (after Credit Check and Risk Assessment), then the sequence is correct. But the timestamp 12:00 is likely an error.

But even if the decision is at 14:00, the Credit Check and Risk Assessment are both at 14:00 — but as long as Credit Check comes before Risk Assessment (if logged in that order), that's okay for the normative rules.

However, the Credit Check is delayed beyond the 24-hour desideratum (but that's not a normative requirement), and there is no follow-up call (another desideratum).

So, **Case 3 does not violate the normative process rules**, only the desiderata (timing and follow-up).

---

## 2. **Desiderata Violations (Recommended but Not Required)**

These are deviations from best practices, but not violations of the strict rules.

### **Case 2:**
- Credit Check delayed significantly after application (if the Credit Check is at 08:30 after application at 08:00 — that's 30 minutes, which might be okay, but if the log shows much longer, that's a desideratum issue).
- Finalized documentation after rejection — while this is a normative violation, the timing of the Credit Check might also be considered a desideratum issue if it's too slow.
- No follow-up call — missing a recommended best practice.

### **Case 3:**
- Credit Check performed over 24 hours after application (desideratum, not normative).
- No follow-up call (desideratum).
- The Risk Assessment and Credit Check at the same time (could be improved for clarity, but not a rule violation).

---

## 3. **Interpretations and Justifications**

### **Case 2 — Normative Violations:**
- The **order of Credit Check and Risk Assessment is reversed**, violating the process sequence. This could lead to inconsistent or non-compliant decisions (e.g., assessing risk before knowing the credit status).
- **Finalizing documentation after a rejection** is not allowed by the strict rules; this could create confusion or record issues.

**Justification for deviation:**  
If this was an accident or a procedural error, it should be corrected immediately. The process must be strictly followed to avoid compliance or legal issues.

### **Case 2 — Desiderata Violations:**
- Slow Credit Check (if significantly delayed) — recommended to keep within 24 hours for efficiency and applicant satisfaction.
- Missing follow-up call — best practice for customer communication.

### **Case 3 — Desiderata Violations Only:**
- Delayed Credit Check — while not required by rules, best practice recommends timeliness.
- No follow-up call — again, a best practice but not mandatory.

## **Summary Table**

| Case | Normative Rules Violated? | How? | Desiderata Violated? | How? |
|------|--------------------------|------|----------------------|------|
| 1    | No                       | N/A  | No                   | N/A  |
| 2    | Yes                      | Wrong order of Credit Check/Risk Assessment; Finalized doc after rejection | Yes (timing of Credit Check, missing follow-up) |
| 3    | No                       | N/A  | Yes (timing of Credit Check, missing follow-up) |

## **Conclusion and Recommendations**

- **Case 2** is non-compliant with the **strict process rules** due to improper sequencing and documentation handling after rejection. It also fails to meet recommended timing and communication standards.
- **Case 3** does not violate the **normative rules**, but it lags on recommended best practices (timing and follow-up).
- **Recommendation:** For Case 2, the process must be corrected immediately to restore the proper sequence and documentation handling. For both cases, it would be beneficial to implement the recommended timing and communication practices to enhance customer experience and process efficiency.
