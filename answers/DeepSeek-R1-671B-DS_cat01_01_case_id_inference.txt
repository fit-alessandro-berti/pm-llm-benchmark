Based on the analysis of patient attributes, department, activity sequence, and timestamps, the events can be grouped into **3 distinct cases**:

---

### **Case 1 (45-year-old male in ER):**
- **Patient journey:** ER registration  triage  X-ray  consultation  discharge.  
- **Events:**  
  1. `Register patient` (ER, 45M)  
  4. `Initial triage` (ER, 45M)  
  7. `X-ray imaging` (Radiology, 45M)  
  12. `Doctor consultation` (ER, 45M, diagnosis: hairline fracture)  
  15. `Patient discharged` (ER, 45M, follow-up: outpatient clinic)  

---

### **Case 2 (62-year-old female in ER):**
- **Patient journey:** ER registration  triage  lab test  diagnosis  prescription  discharge.  
- **Events:**  
  2. `Register patient` (ER, 62F)  
  5. `Initial triage` (ER, 62F)  
  8. `Lab test requested` (ER, 62F)  
  10. `Lab test completed` (Lab, 62F)  
  11. `Doctor consultation` (ER, 62F, diagnosis: minor infection)  
  14. `Prescription created` (ER, 62F, antibiotics)  
  17. `Patient discharged` (ER, 62F, follow-up: pharmacy pickup)  

---

### **Case 3 (28-year-old male in Surgery):**
- **Patient journey:** Surgery registration  consultation  surgery prep  procedure  recovery  discharge.  
- **Events:**  
  3. `Register patient` (Surgery, 28M)  
  6. `Doctor consultation` (Surgery, 28M, scheduled knee surgery)  
  9. `Surgery preparation` (Surgery, 28M)  
  13. `Surgery performed` (Surgery, 28M, arthroscopy)  
  16. `Recovery room` (Surgery, 28M)  
  18. `Patient discharged` (Surgery, 28M, follow-up: physiotherapy)  

---

### **Key Observations for Grouping:**
1. **Patient attributes** (`patient_age`, `patient_gender`) are consistent within each group.  
2. **Department alignment**:  
   - ER cases (45M, 62F) involve ER, Radiology, and Lab departments.  
   - Surgery case (28M) stays in Surgery and Recovery.  
3. **Logical activity flow**:  
   - ER cases follow triage  diagnostics  treatment  discharge.  
   - Surgery case follows preparation  surgery  recovery  discharge.  
4. **Timestamps**: No overlapping activities for the same patient (e.g., 45M’s discharge occurs before 62F’s discharge).
