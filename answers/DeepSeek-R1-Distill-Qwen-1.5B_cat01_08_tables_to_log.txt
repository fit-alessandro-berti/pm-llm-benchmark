Okay, so I need to help the user by creating a comprehensive event log from several ERP tables. Let me go through each table and see how to map the data.

First, the Orders table has order IDs, order dates, customer info, etc. Each order should be a separate event. Since the case ID is order_id, each order will be its own event. I'll list each order, their date, and note any relevant attributes.

Next, the Order Lines table. Each line in an order has an item_id, quantity, item_picking_date, picker_id. These lines are part of the order, so they should be events linked to the order. I'll calculate the total quantity and maybe include the item_picking_date as the event date.

The Delivery table lists multiple deliveries per order. Each delivery has an order_id, dispatch date, arrival date, carrier, and note. These are separate events, linked to the order. I'll include each delivery as a separate event, noting when it arrived.

For the Invoice table, each invoice relates to an order. The invoice has an issue date, amount, and billing person. This is a straightforward event linked to the order.

The Payments table lists payments for invoices. Payment details include date, invoice, method, and reference. Each payment is a separate event, linked to the invoice and order.

The Products table isn't essential, but maybe it's useful for additional context. It provides item descriptions and categories, which could help in understanding the data better.

Now, I'll link each event using case_id (order_id), activity name. For Order Lines and Delivery, the activity is "Order Processing" since they involve handling the order. For Invoice, it's "Invoice Processing". For Payments, it's "Payment Processing".

I'll ensure the timestamps are corrected or included where necessary. For Order Lines and Delivery, the item_picking_date or delivery_arrival_date becomes the timestamp. For Payments, payment_date is the timestamp.

I'll also note that the output requires events per order and include all relevant attributes. Missing data is noted with assumptions, like quantity for Order Lines.

Finally, I'll structure the output as a Markdown table, making sure each row has the required columns and that timestamps are in chronological order.

### Explanation:
- **Case ID**: Each row is identified by the order ID.
- **Activity Name**: Typically "Order Processing" unless otherwise specified.
- **Timestamp**: The date and time when the event occurred.
- **Event Details**: Includes the item or process that performed the event, the date, quantity where applicable, and references if necessary.
- **Notes**: Additional information about each event, such as pickup details or payment notes.

This table ensures that all events are captured accurately, linking each activity to its corresponding order and providing detailed timestamps.
