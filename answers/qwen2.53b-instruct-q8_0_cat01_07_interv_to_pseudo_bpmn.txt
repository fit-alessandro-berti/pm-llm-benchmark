Based on the interview excerpts provided, here is a structured textual representation of the invoice approval process:

### Invoice Approval Process

#### Activities/Tasks:
1. **Receive Invoice**
    - An email from Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) delivers an invoice to Purchasing Officer (Dan).
2. **Check Valid PO Number**
    - Mary checks if the invoice has a valid Purchase Order number.
3. **Send Back for Details if No PO**
    - If no PO, Mary sends it back to the supplier and requests more details.
4. **Log Into Accounting System**
    - If the invoice has a valid PO, Mary logs the invoice into the accounting system.
5. **Confirm Goods Received & Invoice Matched**
    - Purchasing Officer (Dan) confirms that goods/services were received as per the PO and sends confirmation to Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
6. **Match Invoice Line Items Against PO**
    - Mary matches the line items of the invoice with those in the PO.
7. **Resolve Discrepancies if Any**
    - If discrepancies arise, such as incorrect pricing or missing items:
        - Mary emails the Purchasing Officer (Dan) to clarify the issue.
        - If unable to resolve easily, she escalates it to her supervisor (Rita).
8. **Managerâ€™s Approval**
    - Once all issues are resolved and confirmed by Dan and Purchasing, the invoice is forwarded to the Department Manager (Carlos) for approval.
9. **Review Invoice Details & Make Decision**
    - Carlos reviews the invoice details (PO confirmation, quantities, prices), special notes.
10. **Approve or Reject**
    - If everything looks good:
        - Carlos hits "approve" in the system.
        - Otherwise, Carlos rejects the invoice and may request further investigation or corrective action.
11. **Final Approvals & Payment Scheduling**
    - After approval by Carlos, if applicable (Carlos typically does not approve directly):
        - The invoice is returned to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).
        - Rita ensures any exceptions are resolved and follows through with the payment schedule.

### Sequence Flow:
- Mary receives the invoice.
- Mary checks for valid PO numbers and sends back as needed.
- Mary logs the invoice in the accounting system.
- Dan confirms receipt and matches items against the PO.
- Discrepancies resolve via communication or escalation to Rita (as needed).
- Carlos approves if everything is confirmed.
- Once approved, the invoice moves through to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) for final checks and scheduling.

### Gateways/Decision Points:
- Confirmation of receipt & invoice match by Purchasing Officer.
- Final approval by Department Manager.
- Resolution or rejection of discrepancies involving Rita as escalation point.
  
### Roles/Participants:
1. **Mary** - Accounts Payable Clerk
2. **Dan** - Purchasing Officer
3. **Carlos** - Department Manager
4. **Rita** - Accounts Payable Supervisor
5. **Karen** - Supplier Relationship Manager

### Exceptions/Variations:
- Escalation to Rita for unresolved issues.
- Retrospective PO creation or invoice rejection if necessary.

This model should be clear and coherent, capturing the typical flow of the process while noting potential variations and exceptions as highlighted by different interviewees.
