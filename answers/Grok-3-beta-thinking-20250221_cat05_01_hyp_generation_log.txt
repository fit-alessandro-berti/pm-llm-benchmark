<think>
So I've got this event log data from an order processing system, and I need to identify anomalies or undesirable behaviors in the process. The normal process flow is supposed to be: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, and finally Receive Payment. But looking at the sample data, it seems like there are some deviations from this sequence in certain cases.

Let me start by examining each case one by one.

First, case 1001 looks pretty straightforward. The activities follow the expected order: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, and Receive Payment. The timestamps also make sense, with each activity happening after the previous one. So, this seems normal.

Now, case 1002 is interesting. The sequence is: Register Order, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Issue Invoice, and Receive Payment. Wait a minute, Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods are happening before Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock. That doesn't align with the normal flow. In the normal process, Credit Check and Stock Validation should happen before confirming and shipping the goods. Also, there's a note in the additional_info for Confirm Shipment saying "attempted_early=Y", which might indicate that someone tried to confirm the shipment prematurely.

Similarly, in case 1003, the sequence is: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, and Receive Payment. Here, Ship Goods is happening before Confirm Shipment, which is backward. Normally, you would confirm the shipment before actually shipping the goods. There's also a note for Confirm Shipment saying "late_confirmation=Y", suggesting that the confirmation happened after the goods were already shipped.

Then, in case 1004, the sequence is: Register Order, Receive Payment, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, and Ship Goods. This is unusual because payment is received very early, right after registering the order, and before issuing the invoice or shipping the goods. Typically, payment is received after the invoice is issued. Also, there's no Perform Credit Check or Validate Stock in this sequence, which might be missing steps.

So, from these observations, I can identify a few anomalies:

Early Confirmation and Shipping: In case 1002, Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods happen before Credit Check and Stock Validation.
Late Confirmation: In case 1003, Confirm Shipment happens after Ship Goods.
Premature Payment: In case 1004, Receive Payment happens right after Register Order, before Issue Invoice and other steps.
Missing Activities: In case 1004, there are no Perform Credit Check or Validate Stock activities.
Now, I need to hypothesize why these anomalies might occur.

For the early confirmation and shipping in case 1002, it could be due to a system error where the process allowed skipping certain steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a policy that allows priority orders to bypass some checks, but looking at the orders table, case 1002 is a priority order, so perhaps that's the reason. Wait, actually, in the orders table, case 1002 is listed as "priority", while others are "standard". So, maybe for priority orders, the process is different, allowing faster processing by skipping or reordering some steps.

For the late confirmation in case 1003, it might be a human error where the logistics manager forgot to confirm the shipment on time, and it was done after the goods were already shipped. Or perhaps there was a system delay in recording the confirmation.

For the premature payment in case 1004, it could be that the customer paid in advance, maybe due to a special agreement or a system glitch that allowed payment before the invoice was issued. Also, the missing activities might indicate that for certain orders, like high-value ones or specific customer types, some steps are optional or automated.

Wait, looking at the orders table, case 1004 has a high order_value of 3000.00, compared to others, so maybe for high-value orders, the process is different.

Alternatively, perhaps there are different process variants based on the order_type or other factors.

Another hypothesis could be related to the resources involved. Maybe certain resources are more prone to errors or deviations. For example, in case 1002, the resource for Confirm Shipment is LogisticsMgr_2, and in case 1003, it's also LogisticsMgr_2 for the late confirmation. So, perhaps LogisticsMgr_2 is involved in these anomalies.

Similarly, in case 1004, the payment is received by FinanceTeam_02, and the invoice is issued by FinanceTeam_01, but I'm not sure if that indicates anything specific.

Also, looking at the timestamps, in case 1002, the time between Register Order and Confirm Shipment is very short, only 5 minutes, which might be unusually fast, suggesting that the confirmation was attempted early, as noted.

In case 1003, Ship Goods happens at 09:10:00, and Confirm Shipment at 09:45:00, so there's a 35-minute gap, which might be significant.

In case 1004, Receive Payment happens just 5 minutes after Register Order, which is unusually quick for a payment process.

So, possible reasons for these anomalies could be:

Process Variants: Different order types (e.g., priority vs. standard) or high-value orders might have different process flows.
Human Errors: Resources might be making mistakes, like forgetting to confirm shipment on time.
System Errors: The system might allow skipping steps or recording activities out of order.
Policy Exceptions: Certain customers or situations might allow for deviations, like advance payments.
To investigate these hypotheses further, I can propose some SQL queries.

First, to check if the anomalies are related to order types, I can query the frequency of anomalies for different order types.

For example, to find cases where Confirm Shipment happens before Perform Credit Check:

I need to find cases where there is a Confirm Shipment event before a Perform Credit Check event.

Wait, actually, in the event log, the events are ordered by event_id, which seems to be sequential, and timestamps are also in order, so I can assume that the event sequence is based on the event_id or timestamp.

But in case 1002, the event_ids are in order, but the activities are not in the expected sequence, meaning that the process allowed activities to happen out of order.

So, to detect such anomalies, I need to check the sequence of activities for each case and see if they deviate from the expected flow.

One way to do this is to assign a sequence number to each activity in a case and then check if the activities are in the correct order.

Alternatively, I can check for specific undesirable patterns, like Confirm Shipment before Perform Credit Check.

Let me try to formulate a query for that.

First, I can find, for each case, the timestamp of Confirm Shipment and the timestamp of Perform Credit Check, and see if Confirm Shipment timestamp is less than Perform Credit Check timestamp.

But actually, since the events are logged in sequence, and assuming that the timestamp reflects the actual occurrence time, I can check if there is a Confirm Shipment event before a Perform Credit Check event in the sequence.

Wait, more precisely, I can check if, for a case, the minimum event_id or timestamp for Confirm Shipment is less than the minimum for Perform Credit Check.

Similarly for other anomalies.

Let me try to write a query for cases where Confirm Shipment happens before Perform Credit Check.

I can do something like:

SELECT case_id

FROM order_event_log

WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'

AND timestamp < (

SELECT MIN(timestamp)

FROM order_event_log

WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND case_id = outer.case_id

)

Wait, actually, since it's the same case_id, I need to correlate it properly.

Better to use a subquery or join.

Alternatively, I can use window functions to get the sequence.

But perhaps a simpler way is to get the sequence of activities for each case and check if 'Confirm Shipment' appears before 'Perform Credit Check' in the sequence.

Since the event_ids are sequential, I can order by event_id.

So, for each case, I can list the activities in order of event_id, and see if 'Confirm Shipment' comes before 'Perform Credit Check'.

One way to do this is to find the position of each activity in the sequence.

For example, I can assign a row number to each event in a case, ordered by event_id or timestamp.

Then, for each case, find the minimum row number for 'Confirm Shipment' and for 'Perform Credit Check', and see if the min row number for 'Confirm Shipment' is less than that for 'Perform Credit Check'.

If yes, then it's an anomaly.

Similarly for other patterns.

Let me try to write that.

First, I can create a view or a subquery to add a sequence number.

For example:

SELECT case_id, event_id, activity,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as seq

FROM order_event_log

Then, using this, I can find for each case, the min seq for 'Confirm Shipment' and for 'Perform Credit Check', and compare them.

So, something like:

WITH sequenced_log AS (

SELECT case_id, activity,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as seq

FROM order_event_log

)

SELECT case_id

FROM sequenced_log

WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'

AND seq < (

SELECT MIN(seq)

FROM sequenced_log

WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND case_id = outer.case_id

)

Wait, again, need to correlate properly.

Actually, better to group by case_id and compute the min seq for each activity.

For example:

WITH sequenced_log AS (

SELECT case_id, activity,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as seq

FROM order_event_log

),

activity_seq AS (

SELECT case_id,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN seq END) as confirm_seq,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN seq END) as credit_seq

FROM sequenced_log

GROUP BY case_id

)

SELECT case_id

FROM activity_seq

WHERE confirm_seq < credit_seq

This should give me the cases where Confirm Shipment happens before Perform Credit Check in the sequence.

Similarly, I can check for other anomalies, like Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment.

For that, I can modify the query to compare the min seq for 'Ship Goods' and 'Confirm Shipment'.

So,

WITH sequenced_log AS (

SELECT case_id, activity,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as seq

FROM order_event_log

),

activity_seq AS (

SELECT case_id,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN seq END) as ship_seq,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN seq END) as confirm_seq

FROM sequenced_log

GROUP BY case_id

)

SELECT case_id

FROM activity_seq

WHERE ship_seq < confirm_seq

This would find cases where Ship Goods happens before Confirm Shipment.

For the premature payment, I can check if Receive Payment happens before Issue Invoice.

Similarly,

WITH sequenced_log AS (

SELECT case_id, activity,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as seq

FROM order_event_log

),

activity_seq AS (

SELECT case_id,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN seq END) as payment_seq,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN seq END) as invoice_seq

FROM sequenced_log

GROUP BY case_id

)

SELECT case_id

FROM activity_seq

WHERE payment_seq < invoice_seq

This would find cases where payment is received before the invoice is issued.

Additionally, for missing activities, I can check if certain activities are present in each case.

For example, to find cases where there is no 'Perform Credit Check', I can do:

SELECT case_id

FROM order_event_log

GROUP BY case_id

HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0

Similarly for other activities.

So, to summarize, I can use these queries to identify specific anomalies:

Cases where Confirm Shipment happens before Perform Credit Check.
Cases where Ship Goods happens before Confirm Shipment.
Cases where Receive Payment happens before Issue Invoice.
Cases missing certain activities, like Perform Credit Check or Validate Stock.
Moreover, to investigate if these anomalies are related to certain order types or resources, I can join with the orders table or the resources table.

For example, to see if the anomalies are more common in priority orders, I can join the anomaly cases with the orders table and group by order_type.

Similarly, to see if certain resources are involved in more anomalies, I can join with the resources table and analyze by resource or department.

Let me illustrate with an example.

Suppose I have the list of cases with Confirm Shipment before Perform Credit Check, I can join with orders to see the distribution by order_type.

For instance:

WITH sequenced_log AS (

SELECT case_id, activity,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as seq

FROM order_event_log

),

activity_seq AS (

SELECT case_id,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN seq END) as confirm_seq,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN seq END) as credit_seq

FROM sequenced_log

GROUP BY case_id

),

anomaly_cases AS (

SELECT case_id

FROM activity_seq

WHERE confirm_seq < credit_seq

)

SELECT o.order_type, COUNT(*) as anomaly_count

FROM anomaly_cases a

JOIN orders o ON a.case_id = o.case_id

GROUP BY o.order_type

This would give me the count of such anomalies by order_type, helping me see if priority orders are more likely to have this anomaly.

Similarly, to check by resource, I might need to identify which resource performed the Confirm Shipment activity in the anomaly cases.

For that, I can join back to the order_event_log to find the resource for the Confirm Shipment activity in those cases.

For example:

WITH sequenced_log AS (

SELECT case_id, activity, resource,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as seq

FROM order_event_log

),

activity_seq AS (

SELECT case_id,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN seq END) as confirm_seq,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN seq END) as credit_seq

FROM sequenced_log

GROUP BY case_id

),

anomaly_cases AS (

SELECT case_id, confirm_seq

FROM activity_seq

WHERE confirm_seq < credit_seq

)

SELECT r.role, r.department, COUNT(*) as anomaly_count

FROM anomaly_cases a

JOIN sequenced_log s ON a.case_id = s.case_id AND a.confirm_seq = s.seq

JOIN resources r ON s.resource = r.resource_id

GROUP BY r.role, r.department

This would give me the count of anomalies by the role and department of the resource who performed the Confirm Shipment activity in those cases.

Similarly, I can analyze other anomalies.

Additionally, for the premature payment anomaly, I might want to check if it's related to high-value orders or specific customers.

For that, I can join with the orders table and look at the order_value or customer_id.

For example:

WITH sequenced_log AS (

SELECT case_id, activity,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as seq

FROM order_event_log

),

activity_seq AS (

SELECT case_id,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN seq END) as payment_seq,

MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN seq END) as invoice_seq

FROM sequenced_log

GROUP BY case_id

),

anomaly_cases AS (

SELECT case_id

FROM activity_seq

WHERE payment_seq < invoice_seq

)

SELECT AVG(o.order_value) as avg_order_value, COUNT(*) as anomaly_count

FROM anomaly_cases a

JOIN orders o ON a.case_id = o.case_id

This could give me the average order value for cases with premature payment, and I can compare it to the overall average to see if there's a pattern.

Alternatively, I can group by customer_id to see if certain customers are more likely to have this anomaly.

For missing activities, I can also analyze by order_type or other attributes.

For instance, to see if priority orders are more likely to skip certain activities:

SELECT o.order_type, COUNT(*) as missing_credit_check_count

FROM orders o

JOIN (

SELECT case_id

FROM order_event_log

GROUP BY case_id

HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0

) AS missing_cases ON o.case_id = missing_cases.case_id

GROUP BY o.order_type

This would give me the count of cases missing Perform Credit Check by order_type.

So, in summary, by using these SQL queries, I can investigate the hypotheses about why the anomalies occur, such as whether they are related to order types, resource behaviors, or specific order characteristics.

Moreover, I can also look for other patterns or correlations, like checking if the time between activities is unusually short or long in anomaly cases, or if certain additional_info flags are associated with anomalies.

For example, in case 1002, there's "attempted_early=Y" for Confirm Shipment, so I could check how often this flag is set in anomaly cases versus normal cases.

To do that, I can query:

SELECT additional_info, COUNT(*) as count

FROM order_event_log

WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'

AND case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM anomaly_cases)

GROUP BY additional_info

Comparing to the overall distribution.

But since additional_info is a free-text field, it might be tricky, but if there are specific patterns or keywords, I can extract them.

Alternatively, if there are common patterns in additional_info, like "attempted_early=Y", I can parse that.

For instance:

SELECT CASE WHEN additional_info LIKE '%attempted_early=Y%' THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END as attempted_early,

COUNT(*) as count

FROM order_event_log

WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'

AND case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM anomaly_cases)

GROUP BY attempted_early

This could show if the "attempted_early=Y" is more common in anomaly cases.

Similarly for other anomalies.

Therefore, by combining these analyses, I can gain insights into the potential causes of the anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the process.

So, to wrap it up, the target LLM should identify anomalies such as out-of-order activities, missing activities, and unusual timings, then hypothesize reasons like process variants, human errors, system errors, or policy exceptions, and finally propose SQL queries to investigate these hypotheses by analyzing sequences, activity presence, resource involvement, and correlations with order attributes.
</think>

Below is a comprehensive response to your query regarding identifying anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the event log data from an order processing system, hypothesizing their causes, and proposing SQL queries to investigate further. The normal process flow—Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, and Receive Payment—serves as the baseline for detecting deviations.

---

### Identified Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors

After analyzing the sample event log data, several deviations from the expected process flow emerge. These anomalies indicate potential issues in the order processing system:

1. **Early Confirmation and Shipping (Out-of-Order Activities)**  
   - **Example:** In case 1002, the sequence is Register Order → Confirm Shipment → Ship Goods → Perform Credit Check → Validate Stock → Issue Invoice → Receive Payment.  
   - **Issue:** Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods occur *before* Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock, which reverses the expected order. Typically, credit and stock checks should precede shipment actions to ensure payment capability and stock availability.  
   - **Observation:** The `additional_info` for Confirm Shipment includes "attempted_early=Y," suggesting an intentional or erroneous early action.

2. **Late Confirmation (Reversed Sequence)**  
   - **Example:** In case 1003, the sequence is Register Order → Perform Credit Check → Ship Goods → Issue Invoice → Confirm Shipment → Receive Payment.  
   - **Issue:** Ship Goods happens *before* Confirm Shipment, which is illogical since confirmation should precede shipping.  
   - **Observation:** The `additional_info` for Confirm Shipment notes "late_confirmation=Y," indicating a delay in recording or performing the confirmation.

3. **Premature Payment (Unusual Timing)**  
   - **Example:** In case 1004, the sequence is Register Order → Receive Payment → Issue Invoice → Confirm Shipment → Ship Goods.  
   - **Issue:** Receive Payment occurs immediately after Register Order and *before* Issue Invoice, contrary to the norm where payment follows invoicing. Additionally, Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock are absent.  
   - **Observation:** Payment occurs just 5 minutes after order registration, and the order value (3000.00) is high, suggesting a possible exception or error.

4. **Missing Activities**  
   - **Example:** In case 1004, Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock are not recorded.  
   - **Issue:** These steps are critical for ensuring financial and inventory feasibility, and their absence could indicate skipped checks or incomplete logging.

---

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

These anomalies may stem from various causes. Below are plausible hypotheses:

1. **Process Variants**  
   - **Description:** Different order types (e.g., "priority" vs. "standard") or conditions (e.g., high-value orders) might follow altered process flows.  
   - **Evidence:** Case 1002 is a "priority" order (from the `orders` table), which might allow bypassing credit and stock checks for faster processing. Case 1004 has a high `order_value` (3000.00), potentially triggering a unique flow like advance payment.  
   - **Potential Cause:** Intentional policy design to expedite certain orders.

2. **Human Errors**  
   - **Description:** Personnel might unintentionally or negligently perform activities out of sequence or fail to log them.  
   - **Evidence:** In case 1003, the late confirmation (Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment) involves `LogisticsMgr_2`, who also appears in case 1002’s early confirmation. This suggests possible recurring mistakes by specific resources.  
   - **Potential Cause:** Lack of training or oversight.

3. **System Errors**  
   - **Description:** The system might permit activities to be logged or executed out of order due to glitches or lax controls.  
   - **Evidence:** In case 1002, the rapid transition (5 minutes) from Register Order to Confirm Shipment, flagged as "attempted_early=Y," might indicate a system allowing premature actions. Case 1004’s missing activities could reflect logging failures.  
   - **Potential Cause:** Software bugs or inadequate workflow enforcement.

4. **Policy Exceptions**  
   - **Description:** Special agreements (e.g., advance payments from trusted customers) or situational factors might override the standard process.  
   - **Evidence:** Case 1004’s premature payment and high order value could reflect a customer-specific arrangement.  
   - **Potential Cause:** Business rules accommodating exceptions.

### Proposed SQL Queries for Investigation

To explore these hypotheses, I propose SQL queries leveraging the `order_event_log`, `orders`, and `resources` tables in PostgreSQL. These queries will detect anomalies and correlate them with potential causes.

#### 1. Detecting Early Confirmation and Shipping
**Goal:** Identify cases where Confirm Shipment precedes Perform Credit Check.  
**Query:**
```sql
WITH sequenced_log AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq
    FROM order_event_log
),
activity_seq AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN seq END) AS confirm_seq,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN seq END) AS credit_seq
    FROM sequenced_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT a.case_id, o.order_type, o.order_value
FROM activity_seq a
JOIN orders o ON a.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE a.confirm_seq < a.credit_seq;
```
- **Explanation:** Assigns a sequence number to each activity per case based on `timestamp`, then compares the positions of Confirm Shipment and Perform Credit Check. Joins with `orders` to check if order type or value correlates with this anomaly.
- **Expected Insight:** Are priority or high-value orders more prone to this deviation?

#### 2. Detecting Late Confirmation
**Goal:** Find cases where Ship Goods occurs before Confirm Shipment.  
**Query:**
```sql
WITH sequenced_log AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity, resource,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq
    FROM order_event_log
),
activity_seq AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN seq END) AS ship_seq,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN seq END) AS confirm_seq
    FROM sequenced_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT a.case_id, s.resource, r.role, r.department
FROM activity_seq a
JOIN sequenced_log s ON a.case_id = s.case_id AND a.ship_seq = s.seq
JOIN resources r ON s.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE a.ship_seq < a.confirm_seq;
```
- **Explanation:** Identifies cases where Ship Goods precedes Confirm Shipment, linking to the resource involved in Ship Goods to assess human error.
- **Expected Insight:** Are specific roles or departments (e.g., Logistics) associated with this anomaly?

#### 3. Detecting Premature Payment
**Goal:** Locate cases where Receive Payment happens before Issue Invoice.  
**Query:**
```sql
WITH sequenced_log AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq
    FROM order_event_log
),
activity_seq AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN seq END) AS payment_seq,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN seq END) AS invoice_seq
    FROM sequenced_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT a.case_id, o.order_value, o.customer_id
FROM activity_seq a
JOIN orders o ON a.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE a.payment_seq < a.invoice_seq;
```
- **Explanation:** Compares the sequence of Receive Payment and Issue Invoice, joining with `orders` to examine order value and customer patterns.
- **Expected Insight:** Do high-value orders or specific customers trigger premature payments?

#### 4. Detecting Missing Activities
**Goal:** Identify cases lacking Perform Credit Check or Validate Stock.  
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT o.case_id, o.order_type, o.order_value,
       CASE WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS missing_credit_check,
       CASE WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS missing_stock_validation
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_event_log e ON o.case_id = e.case_id
GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_type, o.order_value
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
    OR SUM(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;
```
- **Explanation:** Counts occurrences of critical activities per case, flagging those with zero instances. Includes order attributes for context.
- **Expected Insight:** Are missing steps linked to order type or value?

#### 5. Resource Involvement in Anomalies
**Goal:** Analyze if specific resources correlate with anomalies (e.g., early Confirm Shipment).  
**Query:**
```sql
WITH sequenced_log AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity, resource,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq
    FROM order_event_log
),
activity_seq AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN seq END) AS confirm_seq,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN seq END) AS credit_seq
    FROM sequenced_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
anomaly_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id, confirm_seq
    FROM activity_seq
    WHERE confirm_seq < credit_seq
)
SELECT r.role, r.department, COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
FROM anomaly_cases a
JOIN sequenced_log s ON a.case_id = s.case_id AND a.confirm_seq = s.seq
JOIN resources r ON s.resource = r.resource_id
GROUP BY r.role, r.department
ORDER BY anomaly_count DESC;
```
- **Explanation:** Focuses on resources performing Confirm Shipment in early confirmation cases, aggregating by role and department.
- **Expected Insight:** Are certain personnel or teams more error-prone?

#### 6. Additional Info Patterns
**Goal:** Check if flags like "attempted_early=Y" are prevalent in anomalies.  
**Query:**
```sql
WITH sequenced_log AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity, additional_info,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq
    FROM order_event_log
),
activity_seq AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN seq END) AS confirm_seq,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN seq END) AS credit_seq
    FROM sequenced_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
anomaly_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id, confirm_seq
    FROM activity_seq
    WHERE confirm_seq < credit_seq
)
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN s.additional_info LIKE '%attempted_early=Y%' THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS attempted_early,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM anomaly_cases a
JOIN sequenced_log s ON a.case_id = s.case_id AND a.confirm_seq = s.seq
GROUP BY CASE WHEN s.additional_info LIKE '%attempted_early=Y%' THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END;
```
- **Explanation:** Examines `additional_info` for Confirm Shipment in anomaly cases to detect recurring flags.
- **Expected Insight:** Do system flags signal intentional deviations or errors?

### Summary

The event log reveals anomalies such as out-of-order activities (e.g., early shipping, late confirmation), premature payments, and missing steps. These may arise from process variants (e.g., priority orders), human errors (e.g., resource mistakes), system errors (e.g., lax controls), or policy exceptions (e.g., advance payments). The proposed SQL queries systematically investigate these by analyzing activity sequences, resource involvement, and correlations with order attributes, providing a data-driven approach to pinpoint causes and inform process improvements.
