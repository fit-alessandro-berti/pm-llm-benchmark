To identify the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, we need to compare the process variants, their frequencies, and performance times. Here are some key observations:

### 1. **Frequency of Process Variants:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The most frequent process variant is "Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a frequency of 284.
  - The least frequent process variant is "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a frequency of 4.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The most frequent process variant is "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a frequency of 1466.
  - The least frequent process variants are those with complex treatments involving multiple unsuccessful diagnoses and treatments before a successful outcome, with frequencies ranging from 9 to 15.

### 2. **Performance Times:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The average performance time for the most frequent process variant is around 260,000 units.
  - Some process variants have performance times as low as 0.000 units (e.g., simple registrations without any treatment).

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The average performance time for the most frequent process variant is around 320,000 units.
  - The process variants involving multiple unsuccessful treatments have notably higher performance times, ranging from 420,000 to over 630,000 units.

### 3. **Complexity of Treatment Paths:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Treatment paths generally involve straightforward processes with fewer steps and fewer unsuccessful treatments before achieving a successful outcome.
  - There are some complex paths, but they are less frequent compared to simpler paths.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Treatment paths are more complex, involving more steps and multiple unsuccessful treatments before achieving a successful outcome.
  - There are numerous process variants that involve multiple cycles of unsuccessful treatments and diagnoses, indicating a more challenging and protracted treatment journey.

### 4. **Discharge Without Treatment:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - There are no process variants that involve discharge without any treatment.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - There is a process variant "Discharge" with a frequency of 505 and a performance time of 0.000 units, indicating that some patients are discharged without any treatment.

### 5. **Thorough Examinations:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Thorough examinations are part of some process variants but are not as frequent as in the unprotected group.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Thorough examinations are more common and are part of many process variants, indicating a higher level of scrutiny or complexity in diagnosis and treatment.

### Conclusion:
The main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups are:
- **Frequency and Complexity of Process Variants:** The unprotected group has more complex and longer treatment paths with multiple unsuccessful attempts before achieving a successful outcome.
- **Performance Times:** The unprotected group has generally longer performance times for their treatment processes.
- **Discharge Without Treatment:** The unprotected group has instances of discharge without any treatment, which is not observed in the protected group.
- **Use of Thorough Examinations:** Thorough examinations are more common in the unprotected group, suggesting a higher level of scrutiny or complexity in their treatment pathways.

These differences highlight potential disparities in the quality and complexity of care received by the two groups.
