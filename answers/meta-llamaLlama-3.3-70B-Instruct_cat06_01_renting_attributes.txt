Based on the provided attribute information, the following attributes could be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual involved in the process. Gender is a protected characteristic, and ensuring fairness with respect to gender is crucial to prevent discrimination.
2. **case:married**: This attribute indicates the marital status of the individual. While not always a protected characteristic, marital status can be related to other protected characteristics like age or gender, and its use in decision-making processes should be carefully evaluated to ensure fairness.
3. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a citizen or not. Citizenship status can be related to nationality, ethnicity, or immigration status, which are protected characteristics. Ensuring fairness with respect to citizenship status is essential to prevent discrimination.
4. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the individual speaks German or not. Language proficiency can be related to nationality, ethnicity, or cultural background, which are protected characteristics. Ensuring fairness with respect to language proficiency is essential to prevent discrimination.

These attributes are considered sensitive because they can be related to protected characteristics, and their use in decision-making processes may lead to discrimination or unfair outcomes. It is essential to carefully evaluate the use of these attributes in the process and ensure that they do not introduce bias or discrimination.

In particular, you may want to investigate the following potential fairness issues:

* Are there differences in the outcomes (e.g., rejection rates, acceptance rates) between different groups based on these attributes?
* Are there differences in the treatment of individuals based on these attributes (e.g., are citizens treated differently than non-citizens)?
* Are there any biases in the decision-making processes that may be influenced by these attributes?

By analyzing these attributes and their potential impact on fairness, you can identify potential issues and take steps to mitigate them, ensuring that the process is fair and unbiased.
