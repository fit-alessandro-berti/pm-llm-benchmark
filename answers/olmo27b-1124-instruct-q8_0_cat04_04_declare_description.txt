The underlying loan approval process defined by the DECLARE model is a structured sequence of actions that ensure compliance with regulations, protect against fraud, manage risks effectively, and enhance operational efficiency while focusing on customer satisfaction. Here's a detailed step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initiation (Existence):** The process begins when a customer submits a loan application. This initial submission is recorded.

2. **Credit Assessment (Exactly One):** An immediate preliminary credit check is performed to assess the applicant’s creditworthiness. This step is crucial for determining the risk associated with lending and is mandated by both regulatory and risk management considerations.

3. **Document Gathering (Existence & Coexistence):** If the preliminary credit check passes, the bank requests any additional necessary documentation from the customer. The model ensures that these documents must be gathered before proceeding further. This step is essential for due diligence and risk mitigation; without proper documentation, lending decisions cannot proceed safely.

4. **Quality Assurance Review (Succession):** Once the additional documents are received and verified, a quality assurance review takes place to ensure the loan offer meets internal standards. This step guards against poor-quality loans that could result in future losses or compliance issues.

5. **Final Loan Terms Preparation (Coexistence & Chain):** Concurrently, the bank assembles the final loan offer package. The model ensures that this step follows the quality assurance review and precedes authorization. It reflects best practices in loan origination by ensuring all terms are agreed upon before final approval.

6. **Approval of Contract Terms (Succession):** Upon passing the quality assurance check, the loan offer is submitted for final authorization. This stage formalizes the commitment to lend under the agreed-upon terms, ensuring that both parties understand and agree to the conditions.

7. **Disbursing Funds (Chain & Succession):** If the contract terms are approved, the funds are disbursed into the customer's account, fulfilling the loan agreement. This final step is tightly linked to the earlier credit assessment and document gathering stages, ensuring that all necessary steps have been properly completed.

8. **Customer Notification (Response):** Finally, the customer is informed of the outcome, next steps, or final decision regarding the loan application. Effective communication is key for customer satisfaction and compliance with consumer protection laws.

The DECLARE model is designed to prevent deviations from these prescribed steps:

- **Preventing Non-compliance:** By defining mandatory activities and prohibiting forbidden ones, the model ensures adherence to legal requirements and internal policies.
- **Maintaining Logical Order:** Activities are linked in a way that logically follows their dependencies. For example, gathering documents must precede credit approval to ensure the assessment is based on accurate information.
- **Risk Management:** Sequencing steps to enforce checks (like credit assessments) before critical actions (like transferring funds) mitigates risk.

If certain activities were performed out of order or omitted:

- **Skipping Preliminary Credit Check:** This would expose the bank to substantial credit risk and potentially lead to loan defaults.
- **Omitting Document Gathering:** Without adequate documentation, the bank operates under incomplete information, risking both compliance failures and potential fraud.
- **Ignoring Quality Assurance Review:** Approving loans without ensuring they meet quality standards could lead to high default rates and regulatory penalties.

In summary, the DECLARE model represents a comprehensive and logically sequenced framework that ensures a customer receives a loan in a compliant, efficient, and customer-friendly manner while safeguarding the bank’s financial health and operational integrity.
