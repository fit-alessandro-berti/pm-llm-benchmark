It’s a BPMN 2.0 process diagram showing an order-to-cash flow across four departments (swimlanes):

- Sales
  - Starts on a timer (“Monday morning”).
  - Subprocess “Check customer’s order”: check order completeness; verify whether the customer exists; if not, add them to the database.
  - Sends “Order details” to other lanes.
  - After receiving a “Product sent” message, Sales drafts the invoice and the process ends.

- Production
  - Message start event “Order details arrive.”
  - Plan production.
  - Waits for/branches on material status from Procurement (material not faulty).
  - Manufacture product; on completion, sends “Product complete” to Warehouse.

- Procurement
  - Message start event “Order details arrive.”
  - “Material Compensation” subprocess to order materials; includes a loop/option to return material if needed.
  - Check materials; if faulty, they can be returned and an “Order cancellation” event is possible.
  - If materials are fine, signal Production (“Material not faulty”).

- Warehouse
  - Triggered by “Product complete.”
  - Send product; emits “Product sent” back to Sales.

Conventions:
- Solid arrows are internal sequence flows.
- Dashed arrows are message flows between departments.
- Gateways handle decisions (e.g., customer in database, material quality).
- A data store represents the customer database.

In short: Sales validates the order and customer, Procurement secures acceptable materials, Production manufactures the product, Warehouse ships it, and Sales issues the invoice once shipment is confirmed.
