Below is a structured, end-to-end approach that uses process mining to diagnose Precision Parts Inc.’s scheduling issues and to design, test, and sustain advanced scheduling strategies tailored for a high-mix, low-volume, disruption-prone job shop with sequence-dependent setups.

1) Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

1.1 Reconstructing the actual flow and machine sequences
- Event log alignment: Parse the MES log into cases (Job ID) with activities (Queue Entry X, Setup Start/End, Task Start/End per machine, Priority Changes, Breakdown Start/End). Ensure event completeness (timestamps, resources, operators, due dates).
- Process discovery:
  - Use a flexible discovery algorithm (Inductive Miner, Heuristics Miner) at two levels: (a) case-level routing model (job flows across machines) and (b) resource timelines (per-machine Gantt from Setup Start to Task End with gaps and breakdowns).
  - Conformance checking to compare actual vs. routings from engineering/ERP, highlighting rework loops, skips, and deviations.
- Resource-centric views:
  - Build machine calendars: for each machine, sequence all activities and statuses (setup, processing, idle, down). Compute timelines per day/shift.

1.2 Metrics from process mining
- Job-level timing:
  - Release-to-completion lead time distribution per family/route, and by priority class.
  - Flow time per operation: Queue (Queue EntrySetup Start), Setup (Setup StartSetup End), Processing (Task StartTask End), Transfer (end of opnext Queue Entry).
  - Makespan distribution for multi-operation jobs; throughput time percentiles (P50/P75/P90).
- Queue/wait analysis:
  - Per-machine queue-time distributions, per-priority and per-routing stage.
  - Age-of-work metrics: time-in-queue vs due date slack upon arrival to machine.
- Utilization decomposition:
  - For each machine: Utilization = Processing time / Available time; Setup ratio; Idle ratio; Downtime ratio (breakdowns).
  - Operator utilization where relevant; cross-operator productivity differentials.
- Sequence-dependent setup quantification:
  - Build a setup matrix S[machine][prev_job_classnext_job_class] with distributions (mean, std, quantiles). Job class could be defined by material, dimensions, fixture, program, tolerance level, or learned via clustering on attributes.
  - Include carry-over effects: last tool/fixture on machine state from previous job; time since last similar setup (decay effects).
  - Fit predictive setup models: regression or gradient boosting with features (prev class, next class, operator, shift, day, tool state) to estimate setup duration before scheduling.
- Schedule adherence and tardiness:
  - Tardiness = max(0, Completion – DueDate). Compute fraction late, mean tardiness, weighted tardiness by priority, earliness cost if relevant.
  - On-time delivery rate per family and priority.
  - Release-date adherence vs planned schedule (if planned schedule snapshots exist).
- Disruption impact:
  - Causal impact of breakdown windows on queue build-ups and tardiness: compare KPI windows pre/post breakdown via Bayesian structural time series or difference-in-differences on similar periods.
  - Hot job priority changes: measure displacement cost on other jobs (added waiting, setups).
  - Propagation analysis: trace jobs that encountered a given disruption and compare their KPIs to matched controls.

2) Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

2.1 Evidence-based pathologies
- Bottlenecks and their impact:
  - Identify chronic bottlenecks via consistently high utilization, long queues, high blocking/starvation interactions. Compute machine-specific flow factor: average queue time at machine / average processing time.
  - Little’s Law checks: WIP vs flow time correlations pinpoint where WIP accumulates.
- Poor prioritization:
  - Variant analysis: split jobs into on-time vs late; compare their paths, queue times by machine, and points where low-priority jobs preempted high-priority jobs (dispatch rule misfires).
  - Slack-at-arrival analysis: show cases where jobs with low slack were not expedited and became tardy.
- Excess setup time from suboptimal sequencing:
  - Compare actual sequence vs an a posteriori minimum-setup heuristic on bottleneck machines; quantify delta in total setup time and associated throughput/tardiness impact.
  - Identify “setup thrash” patterns (rapid alternation among incompatible families).
- Starvation and blocking:
  - Resource contention windows: periods when bottleneck’s output gaps starved downstream machines or upstream queues overflowed, producing bullwhip WIP fluctuations.
  - Synchronization failures between paired resources (e.g., heat treat batch release timing vs inspection capacity).
- WIP bullwhip:
  - Time series of WIP by work center; compute coefficient of variation and cross-correlation lags to show amplification from upstream variability and hot-job insertions.

2.2 Process mining techniques to substantiate
- Bottleneck analysis plug-ins: token-based replay and performance spectrum plots to see wait-time hotspots.
- Variant/path comparison: directly compare process variants of on-time vs late cohorts; visualize where paths diverge or where rework appears more often.
- Social/resource graphs: highlight resource contention and machine-to-machine handoff friction.
- Setup sequence heatmaps: visualize high-cost transitions dominating certain periods/shifts.

3) Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

3.1 Likely root causes
- Static, local dispatching in a dynamic environment:
  - Local FCFS/EDD ignores sequence-dependent setup costs, downstream congestion, and global due date risk; process mining shows frequent preemptions and “wrong job served” events near due dates.
- Lack of real-time visibility:
  - Operators schedule blind to queue lengths downstream; mining shows “wrong-time” releases and unnecessary WIP injections.
- Inaccurate task/setup estimates:
  - Planned vs actual variances significant; variance heteroskedastic across job families/operators/shifts. Inaccurate estimates cause infeasible plans and brittle schedules.
- Poor handling of sequence-dependent setups:
  - No policy to group similar jobs or preserve sequence continuity; observed frequent high-cost transitions and avoidable setups.
- Weak disruption response:
  - Breakdown handling is reactive, not re-optimizing sequences or rerouting; mining finds prolonged post-breakdown recovery, tardiness spikes.

3.2 Distinguishing scheduling logic vs capacity/variability constraints
- Capacity sufficiency tests:
  - Using mined time distributions, simulate theoretical best-case with perfect sequencing and zero breakdowns: if tardiness remains high, capacity is insufficient; else scheduling is the main culprit.
- Variance decomposition:
  - ANOVA/ML models partition tardiness into contributions: processing variability, setup variability, breakdowns, dispatching decisions (sequence features), and WIP context.
- Counterfactual replays:
  - Reconstruct “what-if” re-sequencing on historical queues (using mined setup models) to estimate avoidable tardiness. Large avoidable component implies scheduling logic issues.

4) Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

Strategy 1: Dynamic, multi-factor dispatching with setup-aware cost
Core logic:
- At each machine decision point, score all available jobs using a composite priority index:
  Score = w1*DueDateSlackIndex + w2*RemainingWorkContent + w3*DownstreamCongestion + w4*SetupCostPenalty + w5*PriorityClassBoost + w6*OvertimeRisk
  - DueDateSlackIndex: (DueDate – ETA_if_started_now)/_leadtime, clipped.
  - RemainingWorkContent: sum of expected processing+setup on remaining route using mined distributions.
  - DownstreamCongestion: expected queue/wait times on next bottleneck from real-time WIP.
  - SetupCostPenalty: predicted setup time from current machine state to candidate job class (from setup model).
  - PriorityClassBoost: weight for hot jobs.
  - OvertimeRisk: if starting the job may push critical operations into overtime.
- Weights tuned via simulation-based optimization or Bayesian optimization.

Use of process mining:
- Provides predictive distributions for processing/setup times, per job class/operator/shift.
- Provides current machine state (last job class) and downstream WIP and queue-time forecasts.

Addresses pathologies:
- Reduces tardiness by considering true due date risk and remaining route time.
- Cuts setup waste by penalizing high-cost transitions while still honoring urgency.
- Alleviates downstream starvation by considering congestion.

Expected impact:
- 15–30% reduction in weighted tardiness, 10–20% reduction in setup time at bottlenecks, 10–25% WIP reduction, improved on-time delivery, better bottleneck throughput.

Strategy 2: Predictive scheduling with stochastic times and disruption-aware planning
Core logic:
- Generate rolling finite-capacity schedules using:
  - Stochastic task duration models (mixture or quantile regressions by job family, operator, shift).
  - Setup time models conditioned on sequence and machine state.
  - Breakdown risk: predictive maintenance or hazard models using historical breakdowns and telemetry to schedule preventive windows and reduce surprise failures.
- Create a look-ahead schedule across the main bottlenecks (and critical paths) using a sampling-based robust optimizer:
  - Sample scenario sets of processing/setup times and breakdown events; optimize a schedule minimizing expected weighted tardiness and setup time under scenarios.
  - Re-optimize at fixed intervals or upon events (hot job release, breakdown).
- Provide ETA predictions and risk bands to customer service using the stochastic schedule.

Use of process mining:
- Estimates distributions and covariate effects; mines breakdown inter-arrival and repair-time distributions; identifies critical routes for focus.

Addresses pathologies:
- Replaces deterministic, brittle plans with robust ones that anticipate variability and disruptions.
- Improves due-date promises and reduces plan nervousness.

Expected impact:
- 20–40% reduction in lateness variability, higher on-time promise accuracy, fewer schedule collapses after disruptions, improved bottleneck uptime via better maintenance integration.

Strategy 3: Setup time optimization through intelligent family batching and sequence design at bottlenecks
Core logic:
- Define product families/clusters that minimize setup transitions using historical setup matrix and clustering (e.g., hierarchical clustering on setup “distance”).
- At bottleneck machines:
  - Implement rolling family batching windows: accumulate ready jobs of the same/similar family and process in near-sequences to minimize setup transitions, bounded by due-date slack thresholds to avoid excessive waits.
  - Solve a traveling-salesman-like sequencing problem with asymmetric setup costs to find minimal-setup route subject to due-date constraints (use insertion heuristics with lateness penalties).
- Propagate family-aware release: coordinate upstream releases so that job arrivals align with batching windows at bottlenecks.

Use of process mining:
- Provides the empirical setup cost matrix and predictive setup models.
- Identifies which machines are worth batching (high setup share, high utilization).

Addresses pathologies:
- Cuts setup thrash on bottlenecks, increases effective capacity, dampens WIP oscillations, reduces overall lead times.

Expected impact:
- 20–50% reduction in setup time on targeted machines, 5–15% throughput increase at bottlenecks, 10–20% lead-time reduction for relevant families.

Optional complementary tactics
- CONWIP/DBR: WIP caps tied to bottleneck capacity to stabilize flow.
- Operator cross-training guidance from performance mining to reduce variability on critical operations.
- Hot-job fast lanes with explicit displacement accounting to manage cost of expedites.

5) Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

5.1 Discrete-event simulation (DES) for strategy testing
Model configuration:
- Routes and branching from discovered process model; rework probabilities included.
- Task-time and setup-time distributions conditioned on attributes (fit from logs).
- Sequence-dependent setup matrix and predictive functions.
- Breakdown and repair-time processes; optional predictive maintenance schedules.
- Resource calendars (shifts, overtime policies).
- Dispatch policy plug-ins for baseline vs Strategies 1–3.
- WIP controls and release policies if used.

Scenarios to test:
- Base load, high load (90–110% of nominal), product mix shifts.
- Disruption-rich scenarios: elevated breakdown rates, injected hot jobs with varying urgency.
- Data quality stress: heavier processing variability, operator mix changes, new job family introduction.

KPIs to compare:
- Weighted tardiness, on-time delivery rate, average and P90 lead time by priority, WIP levels, machine utilization split (processing/setup/idle/downtime), setup time totals, number of preemptions or reschedules, schedule stability, ETA accuracy and calibration.

Optimization/selection:
- Tune strategy parameters (weights, batching window lengths, slack thresholds) via automated search (e.g., Bayesian optimization) on the DES environment.
- Select the policy that Pareto-dominates on weighted tardiness and WIP without unacceptable risk increases.

5.2 Continuous monitoring and adaptation framework
- Live digital twin:
  - Stream MES events; continuously recompute queues, machine states, ETA predictions.
  - Drift detection on task/setup time distributions; trigger re-estimation of models when KL divergence or PSI exceeds thresholds.
- KPI dashboards:
  - Real-time and rolling metrics for tardiness, WIP by center, setup shares, breakdown MTBF/MTTR, bottleneck identification.
  - Control charts for queue times and setup durations at critical machines.
- Policy health checks:
  - Compare realized vs predicted setup/processing times; monitor dispatch-score residuals to detect model bias.
  - Alert when hot-job insertions exceed a threshold and auto-tighten batching windows or adjust weights to protect due dates.
- Closed-loop learning:
  - Periodic retraining of predictive models; quarterly re-clustering of families as product mix evolves.
  - A/B testing of policy tweaks in low-risk windows or on selected machines before global rollout.

Implementation roadmap
1) Data engineering: cleanse event logs; standardize activity taxonomy; add job attributes needed for family clustering.
2) Baseline mining: performance dashboard, bottleneck detection, setup matrix estimation, predictive models for durations and setups.
3) DES build: validate against historical KPI baselines; ensure face validity with supervisors.
4) Strategy design and tuning: simulate Strategies 1–3 across scenarios; select Pareto-optimal parameters.
5) Pilot deployment: start with one bottleneck machine/cell; monitor; iterate parameters.
6) Scale-out and sustain: implement continuous monitoring, periodic retraining, and governance for hot-job handling and maintenance integration.

Expected outcomes
- Significant reduction in weighted tardiness and WIP, improved lead-time predictability, better utilization of bottleneck resources, and more resilient performance under disruptions, driven by data-informed, adaptive scheduling rather than static local rules.
