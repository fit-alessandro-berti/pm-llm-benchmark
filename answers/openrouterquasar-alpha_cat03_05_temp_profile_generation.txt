### Explanation:
- Times are in seconds (`86400` seconds = 1 day).
- I included pairs spanning both directly connected and multi-step separations to capture process complexity.
- Estimated averages reflect typical durations for real-world supply chains; standard deviations indicate typical variability but can be tuned.
- These values serve as a **model** for analysis of deviations (e.g., bottlenecks or exceptional delays) using the `ZETA` threshold.
