Here is a **Python dictionary** representing the **temporal profile** for a subset of activity pairs in the **global supply chain process** for manufacturing high-tech electronics. The values for average time and standard deviation have been estimated based on typical industry practices, logistics, and process complexity:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 21600),           # Supplier Selection to Order Placement (1 day ± 6 hours)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 172800),         # Order Placement to Receive Components (1 week ± 48 hours)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (28800, 7200),            # Receive Components to Quality Inspection (8 hours ± 2 hours)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (604800, 259200),         # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly (1 week ± 72 hours)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (1209600, 345600),        # Component Assembly to Product Testing (2 weeks ± 96 hours)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 43200),           # Product Testing to Packaging (1 day ± 12 hours)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (28800, 14400),           # Packaging to Warehouse Storage (8 hours ± 4 hours)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (604800, 172800),         # Warehouse Storage to Distribution (1 week ± 48 hours)

### Notes:
- **Units**: All times are in **seconds**.
- **ZETA**: For use in deviation detection, a typical `ZETA` value like 2 or 3 can be used to detect outliers.
- **Estimation Rationale**: 
  - Supplier lead times are long, so `(SS, RC)` is estimated to be 8 days.
  - Manufacturing and testing steps are time-consuming and variable.
  - After-sales support is typically a long tail and may follow a skewed distribution.
  - Standard deviations reflect process variability due to logistics, delays, and rework.

This temporal profile can be used to **detect process deviations** in event logs by comparing observed time intervals against expected ranges defined by `(AVG ± ZETA * STDEV)`.
