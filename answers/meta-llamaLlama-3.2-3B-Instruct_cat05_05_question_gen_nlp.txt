3. How do you mitigate the risks associated with global supplier reliability, quality, and compliance with environmental and labor regulations?
4. What strategies can be employed to minimize the impact of lead times, inventory levels, and stockouts on customer satisfaction and revenue?
5. How do digital systems, data analytics, and machine learning models contribute to predictive insights and better inventory management in this supply chain?
6. What are the implications of just-in-time replenishment strategies for managing inventory levels, reducing costs, and improving supply chain resilience?
7. How do you balance the need for regional distribution centers with the complexity of customs, insurance, and regulatory compliance in different countries?
8. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of direct-to-consumer shipping for special VIP or pre-order customers, and how do you measure their impact on the overall supply chain?
9. How do you manage the cultural, linguistic, and regulatory differences that arise when working with global suppliers, logistics partners, and distributors?
