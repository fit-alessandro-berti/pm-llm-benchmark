### 1. Cases Violating Normative Rules

The normative rules enforce a strict linear sequence and decision-specific branching for the loan application process. Violations occur when steps are skipped, performed out of order, or contradict the approval/rejection logic. Below is an analysis for each case:

- **Case 1**: No violations. The process follows the exact required sequence: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case. All ordering rules are satisfied, with no skips or contradictions.

- **Case 2**: Multiple violations of normative rules.
  - Risk Assessment is performed before Credit Check, violating the ordering rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.
  - Inform Applicant is entirely skipped after Loan Decision, violating the requirement that notification must follow the decision.
  - Finalize Documentation is performed after Loan Decision (Rejected), which is not allowed under the rejection branch (cases should close without finalization).
  These issues represent serious deviations, as they skip mandatory steps, reverse required order, and perform contradictory actions.

- **Case 3**: No violations. The process adheres to the full sequence for an approved loan: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case. Ordering is correct, and the approval branch is followed without skips or reversals.

### 2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions

Desiderata represent recommended best practices for efficiency and customer experience, such as timely execution and optional enhancements. These are not enforceable like normative rules and do not constitute serious violations—only suboptimal behavior that could be improved for better outcomes (e.g., faster processing or higher satisfaction). Failures are identified based on the guidelines: Credit Check within ~24 hours of Application Received, Inform Applicant within ~48 hours of Loan Decision, and performing a Follow-up Call before Close Case (encouraged but optional).

- **Case 1**: Minor failure in desiderata.
  - Credit Check occurs ~30 minutes after Application Received (meets timing).
  - Inform Applicant occurs ~2 hours after Loan Decision (meets timing).
  - No Follow-up Call is recorded before Close Case (suboptimal, as it misses an opportunity for alignment, but this is not a severe issue).

- **Case 2**: Multiple desiderata failures, compounding the normative issues.
  - Credit Check occurs ~1 hour 20 minutes after Application Received (meets timing).
  - Inform Applicant is skipped entirely (exceeds 48-hour recommendation dramatically; suboptimal for customer experience).
  - No Follow-up Call is recorded before Close Case (suboptimal, though overshadowed by normative violations).
  These deviations indicate inefficiency but are secondary to the strict rule breaches.

- **Case 3**: Several desiderata failures.
  - Credit Check occurs ~49 hours after Application Received (exceeds 24-hour recommendation; suboptimal due to delay).
  - Inform Applicant occurs ~51 hours after Loan Decision (exceeds 48-hour recommendation; suboptimal for prompt communication).
  - No Follow-up Call is recorded before Close Case (suboptimal, missing a chance for verification).
  Overall, this case shows delays that could frustrate applicants but remain within acceptable bounds since normative rules are intact.

### 3. Suggested Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors

To align observed behaviors with the constraints and recommendations where possible, we can interpret deviations through practical, real-world lenses (e.g., operational realities) without excusing strict violations. These suggestions aim to provide constructive context rather than rationalize non-compliance.

- **Case 1**: Fully aligned with both normative rules and desiderata (except the unrecorded Follow-up Call). A possible justification for omitting the call is resource prioritization—e.g., high-volume day where automated notifications sufficed for alignment. This keeps the process efficient without risking violations.

- **Case 2**: Normative violations are hard to justify strictly, as they disrupt core integrity (e.g., Risk Assessment without Credit Check risks inaccurate decisions). However, one interpretation is a system or human error: the initial Risk Assessment might have been a preliminary "pre-check" mislabeled in the log, with Credit Check retroactively added to comply, but executed out of sequence due to urgent staffing shifts. For Finalize Documentation after rejection, it could reflect an automated workflow glitch that triggered documentation templates indiscriminately. On desiderata, the skipped Inform Applicant might stem from an assumption of rejection implying no need for urgency, though this is suboptimal; a Follow-up Call could have been deferred as non-essential in a rushed closure. Overall, this suggests a need for better error-proofing in the workflow.

- **Case 3**: Normative compliance is strong, so focus on desiderata delays. The ~49-hour gap to Credit Check (Friday morning to Sunday morning) could be justified by weekend non-operation—January 12, 2024, was a Friday, with no activity Saturday (January 13), implying office closure; Sunday execution might indicate an on-call team handling backlog to avoid further slippage. Similarly, the ~51-hour delay to Inform Applicant (Sunday noon to Tuesday afternoon) aligns with post-weekend processing, where Monday (January 15) saw no activity, possibly due to holiday or volume (Martin Luther King Jr. Day was January 15, 2024, a U.S. federal holiday). The absent Follow-up Call might be interpreted as reliance on digital confirmations during delays, prioritizing closure over extras. These point to external factors like holidays/weekends causing suboptimality, suggesting recommendations like extended holiday buffers in timing guidelines.
