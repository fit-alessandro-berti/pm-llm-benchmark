**POWL Model Structure Explanation:**

1. **Initial Sequence:** The process starts with a strict sequence: OR -> MS -> QS -> AS.

2. **Optional Loop (IQC, AS):** After AS, there's an optional loop represented by `loop_IQC_AS`. This loop indicates that IQC and AS can be repeated multiple times. The loop can be skipped altogether. The dependency is added both from AS and from the loop node, to the next step.

3. **Optional Loop (TST, RT):** Following the optional IQC/AS loop or AS directly, there's another optional loop: `loop_TST_RT`. This represents the possibility of TST being followed by RT, and then back to TST. This loop can also be skipped entirely. The dependency is added both from TST and from the loop node, to the next step.

4. **Choice (LB, skip):** After PK, there's a choice represented by `xor_LB_skip`. This indicates that either LB is performed, or it's skipped (represented by the silent transition `skip`).

5. **Final Sequence:** The process concludes with DP -> D.

**Concurrency:**

- The model implicitly represents concurrency where there are no order relationships specified between nodes. In this case, concurrency is limited due to the largely sequential nature of the process, but the choice between LB and skip offers a degree of parallel behavior.
- The optional loops also represent a degree of concurrency, allowing the process to proceed even if the loop isn't executed at all.
