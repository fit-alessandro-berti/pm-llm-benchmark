### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking  
**Data Integration and Preprocessing:**  
- **Source Alignment:** Normalize data timestamps and map events to a unified log using Case IDs (vehicle-day) and timestamps. GPS events (speed, location) are linked to scanner events (delivery milestones) via vehicle ID and timestamps. Maintenance logs are cross-referenced with vehicle IDs to flag downtime.  
- **Challenges:**  
  - **Data Gaps:** Inconsistent timestamps or missing scanner entries (e.g., a delivery with no "Depart Customer" event).  
  - **Scalability:** High-frequency GPS data (e.g., 1-second intervals) may require aggregation to avoid computational bottlenecks.  
  - **Semantics:** Converting maintenance logs (e.g., "Engine Warning Light") into causal deviations (e.g., a route deviation requiring redirection).  

**Process Discovery:**  
- **Algorithm Selection:** Use the Heuristicsnet algorithm (ProM) to extract the actual process model, capturing sequences of events (e.g., departure  traffic delays  failed delivery  maintenance stop  return).  
- **Model Visualization:** The discovered model would show deviations from planned routes, such as unplanned stops, extended dwell times, or traffic-related delays.  

**Conformance Checking:**  
- **Comparison Framework:** Compare the actual process model (mined) against the planned routes ( dispatch system data) using model misalignment metrics (e.g.,2 for sequence deviations).  
- **Root Deviations identificated:**  
  - **Sequence Deviations:** unplanned stops (e.g., vehicle breakdowns during a shift).  
  - **Planned vs. Actual Timing:** routes that exceed 20% of the planned duration.  
  - **Capacity Violations:** assigning packages exceeding vehicle capacity (e.g., 10 packages vs. a 7-seat van).

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification  
**KPIs (/from Event Log):**  
- **On-Time Delivery Rate (ODR):** ` deliveries where actual arrival  promised window / total deliveries`.  
- **Average dwell Time:** ` /  deliveries`.  
- **Fuel Efficiency:** ` (GPS speed) /  (Maintenance logs)`.  
- **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** ` /`.  

**Bottleneck Identification:**  
- **Variant Analysis:** Use historical data to compare high- vs. low-performing routes/drivers.  
  - Low ODR routes (e.g., ODR < 70%) may correlate with high variability in customer time windows.  
  - Routes with frequent speed drops (5 km/h for >5 mins) indicate traffic hotspots.  
- **Bottleneck types:**  
  - **Operational:**planning traffic delays (e.g., 30% routes delayed 10 mins).  
  - **Human cocos:** High dwell time despite short "Arrive Customer"–"Depart Customer" times (e.g., driver-customer interaction delays).

### 3. Root Cause Analysis  
**Key Hypothesized Causes:**  
- **Durability Route Planning:** Static routes ignoring real-time traffic (actual vs. planned duration40%).  
- **Inaccurate Traffic Estimates:** Dispatch routes assume average speeds (>80 km/h) vs. GPS speeds <40 km/h in congestion.  
- **High Customer Availability Variability:** 25% of stops required 2–3 re-deliveries due to customer unavailability.  

**Process Mining Validation:**  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Map traffic penalty (GPS speed drops) to route delays using statistical regression.  
- **Dwell Time Variants:** Compare dwell time variability between "Delivery Success" vs. "Delivery Failed" events.  
- **Maintenance Impact:** Routes with vehicles requiring unscheduled stops during shifts show 15% longer average delivery times.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies  
**Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing with Constraints**  
- **Target:** Reduce delays from traffic.  
- **Root Cause:** Static routes ignoring real-time conditions.  
- **Implementation:** Integrate GPS real-time speeds and traffic APIs (e.g., Google Maps Matrix API) to reroute vehicles during speed drops >10%. Model optimization using Conformance Checking ensures routes adhere to vehicle capacity and driver time windows.  
- **Expected KPI Impact:** ODR15%, Travel Time Ratio (Travel/Service Time)20%.  

**Strategy 2: Predictive Maintenance Based on Usage Patterns**  
- **Target:** Minimize vehicle downtime.  
- **Root Cause:** Unscheduled maintenance during high-demand shifts.  
- **Implementation:** Train a model (e.g., LSTM) on historical maintenance logs and GPS data (e.g., engine load, idle time) to predict breakdowns. Schedule preventive maintenance during low demand periods.  
- **Expected KPI Impact:** Maintenance Cost25%, Vehicle Utilization Rate10%.  

**Strategy 3: Enhanced Customer Time Window Management**  
- **Target:** Reduce failed deliveries.  
- **Root Cause:** Inaccurate promised windows due to ignoring historical volatility.  
- **Implementation:** Update customer time windows using historical data (e.g., 70% of Stop 5 deliveries occur between 10:00–12:00). Communicate adjusted windows to drivers/scanners.  
- **Expected KPI Impact:** Failed Delivery Rate30%, ODR25%.

### 5. Operational Constraints and Monitoring  
**Constraints Handling:**  
- **Driver Hours:** Integrate with driving hour regulations (e.g., EU trabajando hours) in routing algorithms.  
- **CustomerWindows:** Enforce windows as hard constraints during route planning.  

**Continuous Monitoring:**  
- **Dashboards:** Track KPIs (ODR,avg dwell time), process adherence (conformancechecking score), and bottleneck metrics (fuel consumption/km).  
- **Alerts:** Trigger alerts for ODR <85% or route deviations exceeding 20% planned duration.  
- **Recursive Learning:** Update models monthly with new data to adapt to seasonal patterns (e.g., holiday surge deliveries).  

**Sustainability:**  
- **John Analysis:** After implementing strategies, rerun process discovery and conformance checks to measure closed-loop improvements.
