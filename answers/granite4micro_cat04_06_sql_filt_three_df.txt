```sql
-- Query to identify cases with specific activity sequence and exclude them
WITH case_events AS (
    -- Identify all cases where the specified sequence of activities occurs
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        timestamp
    FROM 
        event_log
    WHERE 
        (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Create Order' AND LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Confirm Order')
        OR activity = 'Create Order'
        AND LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Confirm Order'
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
filtered_cases AS (
    -- Filter cases where the time difference between Create Order and Confirm Order exceeds 5 days
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS max_diff_timestamp
    FROM 
        case_events
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
    HAVING 
        (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp)) > interval '5' day
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    event_log
WHERE 
    case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);
```

This query first identifies cases with the specified activity sequence and then filters out those where the time difference between `Create Order` and `Confirm Order` exceeds 5 days. The final result includes all events from `event_log` that are not part of these identified cases.
