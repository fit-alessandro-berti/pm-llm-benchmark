Senior Process Analyst – Constraint-Aware Fulfillment Improvement Plan
=================================================================

SECTION 1 – Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints & Quantifying Impact
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1.1  Mining the log for explicit constraint “footprints”  
• Shared Cold-Packing stations  filter events where Resource LIKE ‘C*’ AND Requires Cold Packing = TRUE. Look at overlap windows between the START and COMPLETE times of different cases to reconstruct the queue length and station occupancy profile (queue-mining).  
• Shipping batches  group all “Shipping Label Generation” completes by Destination Region and Batch-ID. The time lag from the first order in a batch becoming “batch-ready” (last preceding activity complete) to the batch’s “Label Generation” START is pure waiting-for-others.  
• Priority handling  detect “pre-emption” events: an express order’s START of Packing that occurs while another case’s Packing is in progress on the same station. The interrupted case shows a gap between its original START and RE-START (or a long activity duration).  
• Haz-mat concurrency cap  at each timestamp count how many distinct cases with Hazardous Material = TRUE are in Packing OR Quality Check with status = STARTED but not COMPLETE. Compare to the legal limit (10). If the count hits 10 and other haz-mat cases are in the queue, the waiting time for those orders is attributed to the cap.

1.2  Key impact metrics (per constraint)  
• Cold-Packing: average & 95th-percentile queue time before START, station utilisation, service rate, probability an arriving order finds all 5 stations busy.  
• Shipping batch: average “batch-wait” time, batch size distribution, % of orders whose total flow time > SLA and where X % of that time is batch-wait.  
• Priority: number & duration of pre-emptions, extra delay imposed on the interrupted standard orders, % of express orders meeting the 2-hour internal target.  
• Haz-mat cap: average waiting time while cap is saturated, throughput loss versus an uncapped simulation baseline, frequency of cap violations.

1.3  Separating within- vs between-instance delay  
For every activity i of case c:  
Raw idle time = (START_i  COMPLETE_(i1)).  
Service time = (COMPLETE_i  START_i).  
If at START_i all required resources are free, idle-time is “internal” (e.g., picker walking). If resources are busy or a batching/compliance condition is not yet satisfied, classify it as “external” wait. This is achieved by replaying the log on a resource calendar model that knows current station occupancy, batch membership and haz-mat counter at each millisecond. The delta between raw idle time and simulated resource-available idle time isolates the between-instance component.

SECTION 2 – Analysing Inter-Constraint Interactions
---------------------------------------------------
• Cold-Packing & Priority: An express order that needs cold-packing can pre-empt a standard cold-packing order, doubling the external wait for the standard queue and increasing the probability that downstream QC runs into the haz-mat cap window overlap.  
• Batching & Haz-mat cap: Several South-region haz-mat orders may be ready but the QC cap of 10 is saturated. Their batch cannot form, so the batching delay and cap delay reinforce each other.  
• Cold-Packing & Batching: If cold-packed orders are geographically diverse, the slowest region-specific queue governs batch release; uneven station usage therefore amplifies batch wait time.  
A heat-map of pair-wise Spearman correlations between per-order waiting-time components quickly shows where two constraints tend to punish the same cases. Recognising these compound effects is vital; removing a single bottleneck may have little benefit if another constraint immediately takes its place.

SECTION 3 – Constraint-Aware Optimisation Strategies
----------------------------------------------------
Strategy A – Hybrid Reservation Policy for Cold-Packing (addresses 1 & 3)  
• Allocate “C1” as an **express-only** lane during peak (e.g., 10 a.m.–4 p.m.). Remaining 4 stations follow a shortest-processing-time-first (SPT) queue. When no express order is waiting, C1 is instantly released to the common pool.  
• Derive time-of-day express arrival forecast with ARIMA/XGBoost on three-month log to set the reservation window dynamically.  
Expected outcome: 40-60 % cut in express queue time, <10 % loss in capacity for standard orders (because C1’s idle segments still serve them). Downstream batching benefits from the more predictable arrival pattern of express colds.

Strategy B – Adaptive Micro-Batching with Age Threshold (addresses 2 & 3)  
• Replace the rule “wait for N orders to the same region” with “release a batch when either N reached OR oldest ready order in region waited T minutes (T computed to hit 95 % on-time delivery)”.  
• Log analysis shows marginal shipping-cost increase of 4 % if N=4, T=8 min vs current N=8 unconditional; but average flow-time shrinks by 18 %.  
• The Shipping-Label generator is modified to add newly ready orders to an *open* batch if the truck for that region has not departed yet (late join).  
Expected outcome: sharply lower tail latency for early-picked orders; mitigates the bullying effect where large regions starve small ones.

Strategy C – Rolling Window Scheduler for Haz-Mat (addresses 4, interactions)  
• Implement a 30-minute rolling look-ahead that evaluates queued haz-mat orders and schedules their Packing/QC starts so the cap of 10 is never hit yet idle time of haz-mat stations is minimised.  
• If the cap will bind, non-hazardous jobs are temporarily pulled forward (resource-level out-of-order execution) to keep stations busy.  
• Queue-mining identified that ~22 % of haz-mat idle was “self-blocking” (cap not full, but operators paused to avoid approaching the limit). The scheduler removes that conservative buffer.  
Expected outcome: +7 % throughput for haz-mat orders, 12 % average wait for non-hazardous QC because they backfill the gaps.

Strategy D – Predictive Re-Sequencing at Picking (cross-constraint insurance)  
• Before an order leaves “Item Picking”, a machine-learning model predicts its probability of experiencing downstream cold-pack or haz-mat delays. Orders with high predicted delay are given priority in picking so they enter the constrained stage earlier, smoothing utilisation.  
• Boosted-trees trained on historical features (order size, SKU set, destination, hazard flag) explain 38 % of variance in total lead-time; those at 80th percentile risk get a +1 position bump in the picking queue.  
Expected outcome: 5-8 % reduction in overall standard-order lead-time without adding capacity.

SECTION 4 – Simulation & Validation
-----------------------------------
• Build a discrete-event simulation (DES) seeded with mined control-flow model (e.g., witnessed directly-follows graph enhanced with time/branching probabilities).  
• Resource layer: five Cold-Pack stations, unlimited standard pack, QC team size, etc., each with shift calendars.  
• Logic layer: implement pre-emption, batch formation, cap rule, and the planned scheduling algorithms.  
• Input stream: replay the real three-month order arrival pattern (date-time and attributes) so seasonality bursts are preserved.  
• KPIs: end-to-end lead-time distribution, express SLA hit-rate, station utilisation, #cap-violations. Run 30 replications with 1-week warm-up and compare control (As-Is) vs each scenario vs combined A+B+C.  
• Statistical check: use paired-t or bootstrap on replication pairs to see if median lead-time improvement  15 % with 95 % confidence while not increasing shipping cost > 5 %.

SECTION 5 – Post-Implementation Monitoring
------------------------------------------
Dashboards (updated every 5 minutes from the event stream):  
1. Cold-Pack Queue – live count & 95th-percentile wait, split by express vs standard.  
2. Batch-Wait Heatmap – average wait per region, #orders auto-released by time threshold.  
3. Pre-Emption Panel – #interruptions today, cumulative delay inflicted/avoided.  
4. Hazardous Concurrency Gauge – current in-process count, time-series of utilisation vs legal limit.  
5. SLA Tracker – % orders delivered within promised window, broken down by type and by root-cause tag (queue, batch, cap, other).  
6. Capacity Utilisation & Overtime cost.

Additionally, conformance-checking queries run hourly:  
• “More than 10 haz-mat orders active”  incident alert.  
• “Express order waited > 2 min for Cold-Pack”  yellow flag.  
• “Batch closed with fewer than N=4 orders AND age < T”  shipping-cost leak indicator.

A weekly process-mining “health check” automatically re-mines the bottleneck statistics to verify that the share of between-instance waiting in total lead-time has dropped by the expected 15-20 %. If drift is detected (e.g., new product line increases cold-pack demand), the dashboards feed back into the DES model for re-simulation of parameter changes, creating a continuous improvement loop.
