Based on the order fulfillment process described, here's a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label')
    },
    
    'always_before': {
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment'),
        ('Receive Order', 'Dispatch'),  # All activities must happen before dispatch
        ('Check Availability', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Invoice Customer')
    },
    
    'always_after': {
        ('Reserve Items', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Record Payment', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Check Availability', 'Receive Order')  # RO always first, others follow
    },
    
    'never_together': {
        ('Pick Items', 'Check Availability'),  # PI cannot happen without RI
        ('Quality Check', 'Reserve Items'),     # QC cannot happen without PI
        ('Pack Order', 'Pick Items'),          # PO cannot happen without QC
        ('Dispatch', 'Pack Order'),            # D cannot happen without GSL
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Generate Shipping Label')  # IC cannot happen without D
    },
    
    'activ_freq': {
        'Receive Order': {1},          # Exactly one per order
        'Check Availability': {1},     # Exactly one check
        'Reserve Items': {1},          # Exactly one reservation
        'Pick Items': {1, 2, 3},       # May need multiple picks for large orders
        'Quality Check': {1},          # One quality check
        'Pack Order': {1},             # One packing operation
        'Generate Shipping Label': {1},# One label per order
        'Dispatch': {1},               # One dispatch
        'Invoice Customer': {1},       # One invoice
        'Record Payment': {1}          # One payment record
    },
    
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    }
}
```

**Key constraints explained:**

- **Equivalence:** RO and CA are logically equivalent as they initiate the process. RI and PI are tightly coupled. PO and GSL are closely related packaging steps.

- **Always Before/After:** Enforces the sequential flow of the fulfillment process where each step logically precedes/follows certain others.

- **Never Together:** Prevents skipping steps in the process flow (e.g., you can't do Quality Check without having picked items first).

- **Activity Occurrences:** Most activities occur exactly once per order, but "Pick Items" can occur multiple times for orders with multiple items.

- **Directly-Follows:** Defines the immediate sequence of activities in the standard workflow.

This skeleton ensures a proper order fulfillment flow while allowing some flexibility (like multiple picking operations) where appropriate for real-world scenarios.
