Based on the provided process flows and their respective frequencies and performances, here are some process-specific root causes contributing to performance issues:

1. **Inefficient Approval Loops:**
   - In several cases (e.g., frequency 7, 6), declarations go through multiple cycles of approval and rejection before final approval. This back-and-forth movement results in delays and inefficiency.
     - *Root cause:* Ineffective communication or unclear requirements leading to initial rejections.
     - *Suggested solution:* Improve communication among approvers and employees, clearly stating reasons for rejection, and setting expectations for resubmission.

2. **Unnecessary Approval Steps:**
   - In some flows (e.g., frequency 6), the declaration goes through multiple approval stages before reaching the supervisor for final approval.
     - *Root cause:* Too many unnecessary approval steps.
     - *Suggested solution:* Streamline the process by removing or combining certain approval roles, where possible.

3. **Bottlenecks in Approval Roles:**
   - Some roles, such as ADMINISTRATION and SUPERVISOR, are bottlenecks due to high frequencies of declaration rejections.
     - *Root cause:* Overburdened approvers may lead to delays.
     - *Suggested solution:* Distribute workload among approvers or provide additional resources if necessary.

4. **Frequent Rejections:**
   - High frequencies and performances associated with rejections (e.g., frequency 5, 4) indicate inefficiencies in the initial declaration submission or approval process.
     - *Root cause:* Employees may not be fully aware of requirements for declaration submissions, leading to frequent rejections.
     - *Suggested solution:* Improve training and provide clear guidelines on submitting declarations to minimize initial rejections.

5. **Delayed Final Approval:**
   - In some cases (e.g., frequency 7), the final approval step takes a significant amount of time compared to other steps.
     - *Root cause:* Supervisors may have competing priorities or heavy workloads, causing delays in final approvals.
     - *Suggested solution:* Set clear service level agreements (SLAs) for approval times and monitor supervisors' workloads.

6. **Low-Value vs. High-Value Declarations:**
   - Some declaration types have higher frequencies but lower performances compared to others with fewer frequencies and higher performances.
     - *Root cause:* Low-value declarations may be mixed with high-value ones, leading to delays in processing high-priority items.
     - *Suggested solution:* Prioritize declarations based on value or urgency, ensuring that critical requests are processed swiftly.

By addressing these specific process-related issues, you can improve the overall performance and efficiency of the declaration approval process.
