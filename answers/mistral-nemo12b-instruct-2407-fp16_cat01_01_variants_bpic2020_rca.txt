Based on the provided process variants and their performances, here are some process-specific root causes that might contribute to performance issues:

1. **Rejections and Iterations:**
   - Many process variants involve multiple rejections (by different roles) before the declaration is finally approved. This leads to delays and increased processing time:
     - `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE` (frequencies ranging from 174 to 29)
     - `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE` (frequencies ranging from 31 to 6)
   - Some declarations are rejected multiple times before being approved, leading to additional delays:
     - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> ... -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> ...` (frequencies ranging from 345 to 11)

2. **Involvement of Multiple Roles:**
   - Some process variants involve multiple roles in the approval process, which can cause delays due to coordination and waiting times:
     - `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` (frequencies ranging from 2473 to 10)
     - `Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` (frequencies ranging from 575 to 8)

3. **Missing Information:**
   - Some declarations are rejected due to missing information, leading to additional iterations:
     - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING` (frequencies of 21 and 7)
     - `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`

4. **Variability in Process Flow:**
   - The presence of multiple process variants with varying frequencies and performances indicates that the process flow is not standardized, leading to inefficiencies:
     - Some declarations are handled quickly (e.g., `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` with frequency 4618 and performance 810,187.903)
     - Others go through multiple rejections and approvals (e.g., variants with frequencies ranging from 345 to 4)

To improve process performance, consider the following targeted improvements:

- Reduce unnecessary rejections by clarifying approval criteria for each role.
- Standardize the process flow to minimize variability and reduce delays.
- Implement a system for tracking missing information to prevent rejections due to incomplete declarations.
- Consider using parallel processing or automated workflows where appropriate to speed up approval times.
