Based on the temporal profile model provided, several anomalies in the claims handling process are apparent:

1. Receive to Approve (R to P):
The average time of about 25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation of 1 hour suggests an artificially rigid approval schedule.

Hypothesis: This could indicate an automated approval system that processes claims at fixed intervals, potentially bypassing thorough evaluation for certain claim types.

Verification SQL:
```sql
SELECT claim_id, claim_type, 
       MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - 
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS time_to_approve
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id, claim_type
HAVING time_to_approve BETWEEN INTERVAL '24 hours' AND INTERVAL '26 hours'
ORDER BY time_to_approve;
```

2. Approve to Notify (P to N):
The average delay of 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days indicates inconsistent notification practices.

Hypothesis: This could be due to a backlog in the notification process, possibly caused by resource constraints or manual intervention requirements.

Verification SQL:
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.region,
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS time_to_notify
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.region
HAVING time_to_notify > INTERVAL '5 days'
ORDER BY time_to_notify DESC;
```

3. Assign to Close (A to C):
A quick average closure time of 2 hours after assignment suggests potential premature closures.

Hypothesis: Some claims might be closed without proper evaluation, possibly due to misclassification or automatic closure rules for certain claim types.

Verification SQL:
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount,
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS time_to_close
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
HAVING time_to_close < INTERVAL '3 hours'
   AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce2 
       WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P')
   )
ORDER BY time_to_close;
```

4. Evaluate to Notify (E to N):
The very short average time of 5 minutes between evaluation and notification raises concerns about the thoroughness of the evaluation process.

Hypothesis: This could indicate an overly automated system that doesn't allow for proper human review or decision-making in the evaluation process.

Verification SQL:
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id, c.claim_type, ce.resource,
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS eval_to_notify_time
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.claim_type, ce.resource
HAVING eval_to_notify_time < INTERVAL '10 minutes'
ORDER BY eval_to_notify_time;
```

These SQL queries will help identify specific claims that exhibit the anomalous behavior, allowing for further investigation into the underlying causes of these temporal irregularities in the claims handling process.
