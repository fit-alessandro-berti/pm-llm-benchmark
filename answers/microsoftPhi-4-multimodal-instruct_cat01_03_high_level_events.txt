Based on the given subset of events, it seems that the process being described is part of a welding assembly line. We can extract higher-level step names by identifying common themes or sequences in the events for multiple case entries. Let’s go step by step, as instructed:

1. First, we group events that look like they are parts of the same procedure.

For Case A1, it seems that the first major set of activities including the steps of material preparation and welding, consisting of:
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

We can identify the next sequence as the next step in this process, as it leads to welding operations that mark a transition to the assembly step:
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld operations (Corner A & B)
- Measure weld integrity
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating
- Visual check

For Case B2, the same manual steps occur, but the welding procedure occurs in a slightly different order due to a change in tooling but the same overall process.

2. Justify Groupings:

Material Preparation step encompasses the first set of events because these actions are foundational and must happen before the material is weldable.

Assembly step (specific to Case A1 & B2) is justified as it involves significant changes to the material itself – the physical alteration of the material through welding and subsequently applying coatings.

3. Name the High-Level Activities:

From our analysis of the process, we can distill two coherent high-level activities:

- Material Preparation: This activity includes setting up the material for the next stages of processing, such as positioning and preheating the sheet metal.
- Assembly and Post-Weld Coating: These are the steps where the actual welding and coating happen. They involve transforming the prepared material into a specific shape and then adding a protective layer.

4. Output Format:

The structured representation of the proposed higher-level activities becomes:

| CaseID | High-Level Activity     | Rationale                                      |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| A1     | Material Preparation    | These steps are preparatory to welding (Aligning, Preheating). |
| A1     | Assembly and Post-Weld Coating | These steps involve the welding processes and subsequent coating applications, affecting the physical state of the material. |

And for Case B2, the summarized high-level activity would be the same, but with an understanding that there are variations in the actual welding tooling used.

Given that we're working with case logs that span a considerable amount of time, and there is a degree of repetition and similarity across the cases, these high-level activities serve as aggregations covering multiple individual events. They help us transition from observing individual machine actions to understanding broader manufacturing steps, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective production analysis and potentially, process improvement.
