This dictionary captures a representative subset of activity pairs, including both direct and indirect transitions, with estimated average times and standard deviations reflecting the complexity of the supply chain process. Values are expressed in seconds, with variability ranging from tightly controlled (e.g., `PT` to `PK`) to highly variable (e.g., `DT` to `AS`).
