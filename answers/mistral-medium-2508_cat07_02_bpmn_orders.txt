The provided visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that outlines the workflow for processing customer orders across four departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. Here's a detailed description of each section:

### Sales
1. **Start Event**: The process begins every Monday morning.
2. **Check for Completeness**: The order is checked for completeness.
3. **Check if Customer is in Database**:
   - If the customer is not in the database, the customer is added to the database.
   - If the customer is already in the database, the process continues.
4. **Send Order Details**: The order details are sent to the production department.
5. **Draft Invoice**: Once the product is sent, a draft invoice is created.

### Production
1. **Order Details Arrive**: The production department receives the order details.
2. **Plan Production**: The production is planned.
3. **Material Check**:
   - If the material is not faulty, the product is manufactured.
   - If the material is faulty, the process loops back to the procurement department for material compensation.
4. **Manufacture Product**: The product is manufactured.
5. **Product Complete**: Once the product is complete, it is sent to the warehouse.

### Procurement
1. **Order Details Arrive**: The procurement department receives the order details.
2. **Material Compensation Subprocess**:
   - **Order Materials**: Materials are ordered.
   - **Return Material**: If materials are faulty, they are returned.
3. **Check Materials**: The materials are checked.
   - If the materials are not satisfactory, the order is canceled.
   - If the materials are satisfactory, they are sent to the production department.

### Warehouse
1. **Product Complete**: The warehouse receives the completed product from production.
2. **Send Product**: The product is sent out, and a notification of the product being sent is generated.

### Connections
- **Sales to Production**: Order details are sent from Sales to Production.
- **Production to Procurement**: If materials are faulty, a request for material compensation is sent to Procurement.
- **Procurement to Production**: Once materials are satisfactory, they are sent back to Production.
- **Production to Warehouse**: The completed product is sent to the Warehouse.
- **Warehouse to Sales**: Notification of the product being sent is looped back to Sales for drafting the invoice.
