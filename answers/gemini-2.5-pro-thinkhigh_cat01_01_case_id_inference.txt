Of course. By analyzing the provided event log, we can infer the distinct patient journeys, or "cases," by grouping events that share consistent patient attributes and follow a logical, chronological process.

The primary attributes used for this inference are `patient_age` and `patient_gender`, which act as a reliable proxy for a unique patient identifier in this context. The logical sequence of `activity` and the consistency of other attributes like `department` and `resource` further validate these groupings.

Based on this analysis, the 18 events can be grouped into three distinct cases.
