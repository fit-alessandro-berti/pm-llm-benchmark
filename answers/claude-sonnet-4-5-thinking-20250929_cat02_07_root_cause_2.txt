# Insurance Claims Processing - Performance Analysis Report

## 1. Case Duration Analysis

Let me first calculate the total duration for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Duration | Complexity | Region | Additional Doc Requests |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|------------|--------|------------------------|
| 2001 | 04-01 09:00 | 04-01 10:30 | **1.5 hours** | Low | A | 0 |
| 2004 | 04-01 09:20 | 04-01 10:45 | **1.4 hours** | Low | B | 0 |
| 2002 | 04-01 09:05 | 04-02 11:00 | **~26 hours** | Medium | B | 1 |
| 2003 | 04-01 09:10 | 04-03 09:30 | **~48 hours** | High | A | 2 |
| 2005 | 04-01 09:25 | 04-04 14:30 | **~77 hours** | High | B | 3 |

### Cases with Performance Issues:
- **Case 2005** (Severe): 77 hours - **51x slower** than baseline
- **Case 2003** (Major): 48 hours - **32x slower** than baseline
- **Case 2002** (Moderate): 26 hours - **17x slower** than baseline

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Root Cause: Claim Complexity  Multiple Document Requests**

**Strong Correlation Identified:**

| Complexity | Avg Duration | Document Requests | Pattern |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Low | 1.5 hours | 0 | Fast, smooth processing |
| Medium | 26 hours | 1 | Moderate delay |
| High | 62.5 hours | 2-3 | **Severe delays** |

**Key Finding:** Each additional document request adds approximately **20-30 hours** of delay to the process.

#### Detailed Impact Analysis:

**Case 2003 (High/Region A):**
- Evaluate  1st Doc Request: 1h 20min
- 1st  2nd Doc Request: 6 hours
- 2nd Request  Approve: **23 hours**  (overnight wait)
- Approve  Pay: **17 hours**  (overnight wait)

**Case 2005 (High/Region B) - WORST PERFORMER:**
- Evaluate  1st Doc Request: 1h 40min
- 1st  2nd Request: **29.5 hours** 
- 2nd  3rd Request: **22 hours** 
- 3rd Request  Approve: **19 hours** 
- Approve  Pay: 4 hours

**Root Cause Explanation:**
- High-complexity claims require multiple rounds of documentation
- Each request-response cycle introduces waiting periods (likely customer response time + system batch processing)
- Overnight gaps suggest work is not continuous or documents arrive after business hours
- The iterative nature compounds delays exponentially

### **Secondary Root Cause: Resource Assignment Patterns**

**Manager Assignment Analysis:**

| Manager | Cases Handled | Avg Duration | Complexity Profile |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Manager_Ann | 2001, 2002, 2004 | ~9.6 hours | Low-Medium |
| Manager_Bill | 2003, 2005 | ~62.5 hours | High only |

**Key Finding:** Manager_Bill handles exclusively high-complexity cases, which take significantly longer. However, this appears to be **appropriate specialization** rather than poor performance.

**Other Resources:**
- Adjuster_Lisa (Region B): Handles cases 2002, 2004, 2005 - wide range of durations based on complexity
- Adjuster_Mike (Region A): Handles cases 2001, 2003 - similar pattern
- No individual resource shows consistently poor performance independent of complexity

---

### **Tertiary Factor: Regional Differences (Minor Impact)**

**Regional Comparison:**

| Region | Low Complexity | High Complexity | Observation |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| A | 1.5 hrs (2001) | 48 hrs (2003) | Efficient for simple cases |
| B | 1.4 hrs (2004) | 77 hrs (2005) | Slightly worse for high-complexity |

**Finding:** Region B's high-complexity case (2005) took **60% longer** than Region A's (2003), with one additional document request (3 vs 2). This suggests:
- Region B may have less efficient document collection processes
- Or Region B customers may be slower to respond
- Or Region B handles more complex high-complexity claims

## 3. Performance Issue Summary

### **Critical Bottleneck Identified:**

```
High Complexity  Multiple Document Requests  Extended Wait Times
```

**The cascading effect:**
1. Complex claim identified during evaluation
2. Initial document request sent
3. **Wait Period 1** (~24 hours for customer response)
4. Second document request needed
5. **Wait Period 2** (~24 hours)
6. Sometimes third request required (Case 2005)
7. **Wait Period 3** (~20 hours)
8. Each cycle adds 20-30 hours to total duration

## 4. Recommendations to Mitigate Root Causes

### **Priority 1: Reduce Document Request Iterations**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Comprehensive Initial Assessment**
   - Create detailed checklists for high-complexity claims
   - Train adjusters to identify ALL required documents during first evaluation
   - Goal: Reduce 2-3 requests to 1 request

2. **Complexity-Based Documentation Templates**
   - Develop standardized document packages by claim type
   - Proactively request all potentially needed documents upfront
   - Expected impact: Reduce high-complexity duration by 40-50%

3. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Implement ML model to predict document needs based on claim characteristics
   - Flag high-risk claims at submission for enhanced initial review

### **Priority 2: Accelerate Document Response Cycle**

**Process Improvements:**
1. **Customer Portal with Real-Time Upload**
   - Enable 24/7 document submission
   - Send automated reminders every 6 hours
   - Expected impact: Reduce wait time from 24hrs to 4-8hrs

2. **Dedicated High-Complexity Team**
   - Assign specialists (like Manager_Bill) earlier in the process
   - Create fast-track approval authority for experienced adjusters
   - Reduce handoff delays

3. **Same-Day Processing SLA**
   - When documents arrive, process within 4 hours
   - Eliminate overnight waiting periods between steps
   - Expected impact: Cut 17-hour delays to 2-4 hours

### **Priority 3: Regional Process Standardization**

**For Region B specifically:**
1. **Investigate Case 2005's 3rd Document Request**
   - Conduct root cause analysis on why 3 requests were needed
   - Compare with Region A's processes for high-complexity claims
   
2. **Cross-Regional Best Practice Sharing**
   - Have Region A's team train Region B on high-complexity handling
   - Standardize evaluation criteria and document requirements

3. **Regional Performance Monitoring**
   - Track document request frequency by region
   - Set targets: Max 1 request for medium complexity, max 2 for high

### **Priority 4: Resource Optimization**

1. **Workload Balancing**
   - Ensure Manager_Bill has adequate capacity for high-complexity cases
   - Consider adding another specialist for high-complexity approvals

2. **Adjuster Training**
   - Both Adjuster_Lisa and Adjuster_Mike handle high-complexity reasonably well
   - Focus training on reducing document request cycles

## 5. Expected Impact

| Improvement | Current State | Target State | Expected Reduction |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| High-complexity claims | 62.5 hrs avg | 12-16 hrs | **75-80%** |
| Document request cycles | 2-3 per case | 1 per case | **50-66%** |
| Document response time | 20-30 hrs | 4-8 hrs | **70-80%** |
| Region B high-complexity | 77 hrs | 12-15 hrs | **80%** |

**Overall Goal:** Bring high-complexity claims from 48-77 hours down to **8-16 hours**, achieving a 5-10x improvement while maintaining quality standards.
