# Case Grouping Analysis

After analyzing the sequence of events, I have inferred the case groupings based on the following criteria:

1. **Patient Identity**: Events with the same `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `additional_info` (especially insurance type) are likely to belong to the same patient.
2. **Temporal Proximity**: Events that occur closely in time (within a few minutes) and follow a logical medical workflow are likely to be part of the same case.
3. **Departmental Flow**: Patients typically move through a sequence of departments (e.g., ER  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge).
4. **Activity Sequence**: Certain activities (like registration, triage, consultation, surgery, and discharge) are typically part of a single patient journey.

## Inferred Case Groupings

### **Case 1 (Patient 45-year-old Male, Private Insurance)**
- **Event 1**: Register patient (ER)
- **Event 4**: Initial triage (ER)
- **Event 7**: X-ray imaging (Radiology)
- **Event 12**: Doctor consultation (ER)
- **Event 15**: Patient discharged (ER)
- **Event 16**: Recovery room (Surgery)
- **Event 18**: Patient discharged (Surgery)

**Reasoning**: This patient is registered in the ER, undergoes triage, gets an X-ray, sees a doctor, and is discharged. There's a mention of a recovery room, which suggests they may have had a procedure in Surgery (even though it's not explicitly stated), and then discharged from Surgery.

### **Case 2 (Patient 62-year-old Female, Public Insurance)**
- **Event 2**: Register patient (ER)
- **Event 5**: Initial triage (ER)
- **Event 8**: Lab test requested (ER)
- **Event 10**: Lab test completed (Laboratory)
- **Event 11**: Doctor consultation (ER)
- **Event 17**: Patient discharged (ER)

**Reasoning**: This patient is registered, triaged, and has a lab test requested and completed. A doctor consults, and she is discharged from the ER. No surgery is involved, and the flow is consistent with a typical ER visit.

---

### **Case 3 (Patient 28-year-old Male, Private Insurance)**
- **Event 3**: Register patient (Surgery)
- **Event 6**: Doctor consultation (Surgery)
- **Event 9**: Surgery preparation (Surgery)
- **Event 13**: Surgery performed (Surgery)
- **Event 16**: Recovery room (Surgery)
- **Event 18**: Patient discharged (Surgery)

**Reasoning**: This patient is registered directly in Surgery, sees a doctor, is prepped for surgery, undergoes surgery, recovers, and is discharged from Surgery. The entire journey is within the Surgery department, suggesting a scheduled procedure.

## Summary of Case Groupings

| Case ID | Events Included | Key Attributes |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Case 1** | 1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 16, 18 | 45-year-old male, private insurance, ER  Radiology  ER  Surgery  Discharge |
| **Case 2** | 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 17 | 62-year-old female, public insurance, ER  Laboratory  ER  Discharge |
| **Case 3** | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 | 28-year-old male, private insurance, Surgery  Surgery  Discharge |

## Notes on Ambiguities

- Event 16 (Recovery room) and 18 (Discharge) appear in both Case 1 and Case 3, which suggests that the recovery room and discharge events may be shared or that the timestamps are very close.
- The patient in Case 3 is registered in Surgery, which is unusual, suggesting a scheduled or pre-registered procedure.
- The timestamps show a clear temporal sequence, which supports the grouping.
