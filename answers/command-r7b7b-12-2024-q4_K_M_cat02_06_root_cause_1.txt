To analyze the event log and identify cases with significantly longer total resolution times compared to others, we first calculate the resolution time for each case:

1. **Case 101:**
   - Received: 2024-03-01 08:00
   - Closed: 2024-03-01 10:15
   - Total Resolution Time: 10:15 - 08:00 = 2 hours, 15 minutes

2. **Case 102:**
   - Received: 2024-03-01 08:05
   - Closed: 2024-03-02 09:15
   - Total Resolution Time: 09:15 - 08:05 = 1 day, 3 hours

3. **Case 103:**
   - Received: 2024-03-01 08:10
   - Closed: 2024-03-01 09:30
   - Total Resolution Time: 09:30 - 08:10 = 1 hour, 20 minutes

4. **Case 104:**
   - Received: 2024-03-01 08:20
   - Closed: 2024-03-02 08:30
   - Total Resolution Time: 08:30 - 08:20 = 1 day, 1 hour

5. **Case 105:**
   - Received: 2024-03-01 08:25
   - Closed: 2024-03-03 09:30
   - Total Resolution Time: 09:30 - 08:25 = 2 days, 1 hour

**Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times:**
- Case 102: 1 day, 3 hours (longest)
- Case 105: 2 days, 1 hour

**Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues:**

1. **Escalation in Case 102:**
   - The ticket was escalated to a Level-2 Agent at 2024-03-01 11:30, which could have introduced delays due to the additional time required for escalation and the specialized team's involvement. This is especially significant since the average resolution times of other cases are much shorter (around 1-2 hours).

2. **Long Waiting Time Between Activities in Case 105:**
   - There is a significant gap between "Investigate Issue" at 2024-03-02 14:00 and "Resolve Ticket" at 2024-03-03 09:00, spanning over 2 days. This suggests potential delays in the investigation process or a lack of timely follow-ups, which can lead to extended resolution times.

**Insights and Recommendations:**

1. **Streamline Escalation Process:**
   - Review the current escalation policies and procedures for Case 102. Ensure that escalations are justified and that specialized teams are promptly assigned to avoid unnecessary delays. Implement a clear communication channel between Level-1 and Level-2 agents to expedite the process.

2. **Reduce Waiting Times in Case 105:**
   - Identify the reasons behind the long waiting period between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket" for Case 105. Consider whether additional resources, tools, or training are required to speed up investigations. Implement measures to ensure that agents are promptly available to investigate issues once assigned, such as providing real-time updates or automated alerts to managers if investigation times exceed certain thresholds.

3. **Standardize and Optimize Workflows:**
   - Analyze the workflows of all cases to identify common patterns and bottlenecks. Standardize processes wherever possible to reduce variability in resolution times. Implement a feedback mechanism where support agents can report issues and delays, allowing for continuous improvement in ticket handling.
