Okay, let's tackle this SQL problem. So, the goal is to find cases that have a specific sequence of three activities in direct succession and then exclude those cases where the time between the second and third activity is more than 5 days. Then, the final result should include all events from cases that don't meet these criteria.

First, I need to understand the structure. The event_log table has case_id, activity, and timestamp. The main steps are:

1. Identify cases with the exact sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' with no other activities in between.
2. Among those cases, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. Exclude such cases and return all events from the remaining cases.

Let me break down the first part: finding the sequence. Since they need to be in direct succession, there can't be any other activities between them. So for each case, the events should have these three activities consecutively.

One approach is to assign a row number per case, ordered by timestamp. Then, for each case, check if there are three consecutive rows where the activities are in the specified order.

Alternatively, using window functions like LEAD to look at the next activities. For example, for each 'Approve Purchase Requisition' in a case, check if the next activity is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

Yes, that could work. Using LEAD twice. Let's see.

For step 1: For each case, find any occurrence where activity at position n is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', activity at n+1 is 'Create Order', and activity at n+2 is 'Confirm Order'.

But how to do that in SQL? Using LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity, and LEAD(activity, 2) as next_next_activity.

Then, check where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and next_activity = 'Create Order' and next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'. If such a row exists in a case, then that case is a candidate.

But also, we need to ensure that these three are consecutive events with no other activities in between. So the timestamps must be in order, and the LEAD functions would capture that if ordered properly.

But perhaps the key is that the three activities are in a consecutive sequence. So using LEAD with the next two steps would ensure that they follow directly after each other.

So once we identify the cases that have at least one such triplet, we proceed to check the time difference between the second and third activity in that triplet.

For the time difference, between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order', which are the second and third activities. So in the triplet, the 'Create Order' is at position n+1, and 'Confirm Order' is at n+2. So the timestamp of 'Create Order' would be the timestamp of the n+1 row, and 'Confirm Order' is the n+2 row.

But in the query, when we use LEAD(timestamp, 1), we get the timestamp of the next activity, which is 'Create Order' in this scenario. Then LEAD(timestamp, 2) would give the 'Confirm Order' timestamp. Wait, no: if the first row is 'Approve Purchase...', then LEAD(timestamp, 1) is the next row's timestamp (which is 'Create Order'), LEAD(timestamp, 2) is the third row's timestamp (which would be 'Confirm Order').

So the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' would be LEAD(timestamp, 2) - LEAD(timestamp, 1). Wait, no. Let's see:

Original row (n): activity is 'Approve...', timestamp t1.

Row n+1: activity 'Create Order', timestamp t2.

Row n+2: activity 'Confirm Order', timestamp t3.

So the time between Create and Confirm is t3 - t2.

In the current row (n), LEAD(timestamp, 1) is t2, LEAD(timestamp, 2) is t3. So the difference is (t3 - t2).

So for each occurrence of the triplet, we can compute this difference. So in the query, using DATEDIFF days between t3 and t2. If that's more than 5 days, then the case meets the condition.

So the plan is:

1. For each case, check if there exists a triplet of consecutive events in the order specified.

2. Among those cases, check if in any such triplet, the time between the second and third event is >5 days.

3. Exclude all events from those cases.

So, first, identify all case_ids that meet both conditions.

Then, select all events from event_log where case_id is not in those excluded case_ids.

But how to structure this in SQL.

Let me start by writing a CTE that identifies the case_ids that need to be excluded.

First, for each case, we can check all triplets of consecutive events. Let's use LEAD.

So write a subquery that, for each event in the case, looks ahead two steps.

Something like:

WITH triplet_check AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
    LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
    LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_order_time,
    LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time
  FROM event_log
)
SELECT case_id
FROM triplet_check
WHERE 
  activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
  AND next_activity = 'Create Order' 
  AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND DATEDIFF('day', create_order_time, confirm_order_time) > 5;

But need to ensure that each case_id is only listed once, even if there are multiple triplets that meet this condition. So perhaps use EXISTS in a subquery.

Alternatively, the CTE could get all case_ids that have at least one triplet meeting the criteria.

But in the triplet_check, each row corresponds to an event in the log. So the same case_id could appear multiple times. So in the WHERE clause, when we match the activity and next activities, we can get all the case_ids where such a triplet exists. Then, in the main query, aggregate by case_id and check if any of those triplets have the time difference >5 days.

Wait, but the DATEDIFF condition is part of the triplet_check. So the query would select case_ids that have at least one triplet where all the activities are in order and the time difference between create and confirm is >5 days.

Yes. That's correct.

But note that the LEAD functions are based on the order of the events, so as long as they are ordered by timestamp, the next and next_next_activity would correspond to the next events. So the triplet_check will correctly capture consecutive events.

But perhaps there's a problem if the same case has multiple triplets. But we only need to find at least one occurrence where the activities are in the sequence and the time difference is >5 days.

So the CTE would capture the case_ids that have such a triplet.

Then, the final query would select all events from the event_log where case_id is not in the CTE.

But in the triplet_check CTE, we have to consider that the same case_id may have multiple entries. So in the CTE's main SELECT, we need to select DISTINCT case_id.

So modifying the triplet_check:

WITH excluded_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
      LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
      LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_order_time,
      LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time
    FROM event_log
  ) AS sub
  WHERE 
    activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
    AND next_activity = 'Create Order' 
    AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND DATEDIFF('day', create_order_time, confirm_order_time) > 5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases);

This should work. The subquery in the excluded_cases CTE finds all case_ids where there exists a triplet that meets the activity sequence and the time condition.

But we need to make sure that the LEAD functions are ordered by timestamp within the case. So the window function's ORDER BY timestamp is correct.

But what about the order of events? Since events are ordered by timestamp, the LEAD functions will look at the next events in chronological order. So if a case has the three activities in order, but with other activities in between, then the LEAD would not capture that. For example:

Event1: Approve, timestamp 1

Event2: Some other activity, timestamp 2

Event3: Create Order, timestamp3

Event4: Confirm Order, timestamp4

In this case, the LEAD(activity,1) from Event1 is 'Some other activity', which breaks the sequence. So the triplet isn't captured. Therefore, the query correctly identifies only consecutive triplets.

So the approach using LEAD(2) is correct.

Thus, the excluded_cases CTE would correctly capture the case_ids where there is a direct sequence of the three activities, followed by a time difference >5 days between Create and Confirm.

Then, the final SELECT returns all events where case_id is not in those excluded cases.

This should handle the requirements. Now, let me check for possible issues.

Edge Cases:

- A case has multiple triplets, some meet the time condition and some don't. For example, one triplet has a time difference of 6 days, another has 4 days. The case should be excluded because at least one triplet meets the criteria.

- The same activity occurs multiple times in a case. For example, 'Approve Purchase' appears multiple times, and in one of them, the next two activities are correct.

The query will find that case if any of the triplets meet the criteria.

Another consideration: the DATEDIFF function. In DuckDB, the syntax for DATEDIFF is DATEDIFF('day', start, end). Wait, DuckDB uses the syntax DATEDIFF(part, start, end). So yes, that's correct.

Also, the 'day' part will compute the number of days between the two timestamps. So if create_order_time is 2023-01-01 10:00:00 and confirm_order_time is 2023-01-06 11:00:00, the DATEDIFF is 5 days, which is not more than 5. But if confirm is 2023-01-07, then it's 6 days, which is more.

So the condition DATEDIFF(...) >5 would capture those cases where it's more than 5 days.

Yes.

Another point: the events in the triplet must be consecutive. So using LEAD(1) and LEAD(2) in the same window ordered by timestamp ensures that there are no other events in between, as the next events are the immediate next ones in chronological order.

So the query should work as intended.

Therefore, the final query is as written above.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to identify cases that follow a specific sequence of activities and meet a certain time condition, then exclude those cases from the final result. Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Approach
1. **Identify Cases with Specific Sequence**: Find cases where the activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' occur consecutively.
2. **Check Time Condition**: Among the identified cases, check if the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.
3. **Exclude Cases**: Exclude all events from the cases that meet both the sequence and time conditions.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH excluded_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
      LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
      LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_order_time,
      LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time
    FROM event_log
  ) AS sub
  WHERE 
    activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
    AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND DATEDIFF('day', create_order_time, confirm_order_time) > 5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation
1. **CTE `excluded_cases`**:
   - **Window Functions**: Use `LEAD` to look at the next two activities and their timestamps for each event, partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp`.
   - **Filter Conditions**: Check for the exact sequence of activities ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order') and ensure the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days using `DATEDIFF`.
   - **Distinct Cases**: Select distinct `case_id` to avoid duplicates, as each case may have multiple valid sequences.

2. **Final Query**:
   - **Exclusion**: Retrieve all events from `event_log` where `case_id` is not in the excluded cases, ensuring the result includes only valid cases.
   - **Ordering**: Results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain chronological order within each case.

This approach efficiently identifies and excludes cases that meet the specified criteria, ensuring the final result contains only the relevant events.
