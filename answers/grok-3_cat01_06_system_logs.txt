### Transformed Process Mining Event Log

Below is the transformed event log suitable for process mining analysis. Each event represents a meaningful activity within a case (a logical unit of work related to a specific document, email, or task). The event log includes the required attributes: **Case ID**, **Activity Name**, and **Timestamp**, along with an additional attribute **Application** for context.

| Case ID                | Activity Name              | Timestamp                  | Application          |

### Explanation of Transformation Logic

1. **Case Identification**:
   - I grouped events into cases based on the specific document, email, or task the user is working on, as identified by the `Window` attribute in the system log. Each unique document or task context (e.g., "Document1.docx", "Email - Inbox" with a specific email action, "Report_Draft.pdf", "Budget_2024.xlsx", "Quarterly_Report.docx") represents a distinct case. This approach reflects a logical unit of work from the user's perspective, as users typically focus on completing tasks related to specific items.
   - For emails, I created a case called "Email_Annual_Meeting" based on the specific email content mentioned in the system log ("Open Email about Annual Meeting"), assuming it represents a single email-handling process.

2. **Activity Naming**:
   - I translated raw actions (e.g., "FOCUS", "TYPING", "CLICK", "SCROLL") into higher-level, standardized activity names that are meaningful for process analysis. For example:
     - "FOCUS" or "SWITCH" to a new document became "Start Document Editing" or "Resume Document Editing" (if returning to a previously opened document).
     - "TYPING" in Word or Excel became "Edit Document Content" or "Edit Spreadsheet Data".
     - "SCROLL" in a PDF became "Review PDF Content", and "HIGHLIGHT" became "Annotate PDF".
     - Email-related actions like "CLICK" and "TYPING" were mapped to "Open Email", "Read Email Content", "Reply to Email", "Compose Email Response", and "Send Email".
     - "SAVE" and "CLOSE" actions retained their intent but were contextualized (e.g., "Save Document", "Close Document").
   - This standardization ensures activities are interpretable and consistent across cases for process mining tools.

3. **Event Attributes**:
   - **Case ID**: Based on the specific document or task (e.g., filename or email context).
   - **Activity Name**: Descriptive and standardized as explained above.
   - **Timestamp**: Retained from the original system log for accurate temporal analysis.
   - **Application**: Added as an additional attribute to provide context about the tool used for each activity.

4. **Coherent Narrative**:
   - The event log reflects the user’s workflow across multiple tasks: editing documents in Word, handling an email in Chrome, reviewing a PDF in Adobe Acrobat, updating a spreadsheet in Excel, and returning to document editing. Each case tells the story of a specific task, with events sequenced to show the progression of work (e.g., starting, editing, saving, and closing a document).

This transformation ensures the event log is analyst-friendly and suitable for process mining tools, enabling discovery of user behavior patterns, task-switching frequency, and task completion times. If further refinement is needed (e.g., merging related documents into a single case), additional context or user feedback could be incorporated.
