To identify which cases in the event log violate the normative process as described, we need to verify if each case follows the expected sequences and constraints outlined in the normative process description. Let's analyze each case step-by-step.

### Case 1
1. **Receive order**
2. **Check inventory**
3. **Authorize payment**
4. **Package items**
5. **Ship order**
6. **Close order**

This case follows the correct sequence for a scenario where the inventory is sufficient. No violations are observed.

### Case 2
1. **Receive order**
2. **Check inventory**
3. **Package items**
4. **Authorize payment**
5. **Ship order**
6. **Close order**

**Violation:**
- **Package items** occurs before **Authorize payment**.
- According to the normative description, "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment." This violates the expected flow.

### Case 3
1. **Receive order**
2. **Check inventory**
3. **Authorize payment**
4. **Cancel order**
5. **Ship order**
6. **Close order**

**Violations:**
- **Ship order** occurs after **Cancel order**. According to the normative description, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items" and never after a cancellation.
- **Authorize payment** occurs before **Cancel order**. This activity should not occur if the inventory is insufficient, as it is not needed for cancellation.

### Case 4
1. **Receive order**
2. **Check inventory**
3. **Cancel order**
4. **Close order**

This case follows the correct sequence for a scenario where the inventory is insufficient. No violations are observed.

### Case 5
1. **Receive order**
2. **Check inventory**
3. **Authorize payment**
4. **Ship order**
5. **Close order**

**Violations:**
- **Ship order** occurs without the **Package items** activity. According to the normative description, "Ship order" should occur after "Package items."
- **Authorize payment** occurs before **Package items**. This might be acceptable if we interpret that the payment authorization can happen before packaging in some cases, but the normative description suggests that "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment."

### Summary of Violations

- **Case 2:**
  - **Package items** occurs before **Authorize payment**.

- **Case 3:**
  - **Ship order** occurs after **Cancel order**.
  - **Authorize payment** occurs before **Cancel order**.

- **Case 5:**
  - **Ship order** occurs without the **Package items** activity.
  - **Authorize payment** occurs before **Package items**.

These violations indicate deviations from the expected process flow as described in the normative process description.
