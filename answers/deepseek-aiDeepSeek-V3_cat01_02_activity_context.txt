### Justification for Renaming:

1. **Verify Documents → Verify Initial Documents**:  
   - This activity occurs at the beginning of the process, where the agent performs the first verification of the customer's documents. The term "Initial" clarifies that this is the first verification step.

2. **Verify Documents → Verify Additional Documents**:  
   - This activity occurs after the customer submits additional documents (e.g., ID scan). The term "Additional" highlights that this is a follow-up verification after receiving more information.

3. **Verify Documents → Verify Adjusted Documents**:  
   - In Case C003, this activity occurs after an account adjustment. The term "Adjusted" clarifies that the verification is performed after internal changes to the account.

4. **Call Customer → Call Customer for Missing Docs**:  
   - In Case C001, the call is made to request missing documents. The phrase "for Missing Docs" specifies the purpose of the call.

5. **Call Customer → Call Customer for Clarification**:  
   - In Case C002, the call is made to clarify an account discrepancy. The phrase "for Clarification" reflects the purpose of the call.

6. **Call Customer → Call Customer for Confirmation**:  
   - In Case C002, the second call is made to confirm adjustments. The phrase "for Confirmation" highlights the follow-up nature of the call.

7. **Call Customer → Call Customer to Return**:  
   - In Case C003, the call is made to ask the customer to return to the branch. The phrase "to Return" specifies the action requested of the customer.

8. **Adjust Account → Adjust Account Details**:  
   - This activity involves making internal adjustments to the account. The term "Details" clarifies that the adjustments are specific to account information.

### Summary of Changes:
- **Disambiguated recurring activities**: By adding context-specific qualifiers (e.g., "Initial," "Additional," "Adjusted," "for Missing Docs," "for Clarification"), the revised activity names clearly reflect their roles in the process flow.
- **Improved clarity**: The new names make it easier to understand the purpose of each activity without needing to refer to the "Additional Context" column.
- **Consistency**: Similar activities across cases are named consistently, ensuring uniformity in the log.
