<think>
First, I need to create two POWL models based on the hiring process description. Both should include the stages: initial screening, skill-based assessments, cultural fit evaluations, and final hiring decisions. The difference is in how they handle the cultural fit and affiliation check.

For the first model, "POWL Model with Potential Unfairness," I need to include an XOR branching after the skill assessment. One branch should be a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other should be a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that could give an advantage based on affiliations. This XOR choice introduces potential bias.

For the second model, "POWL Model Without Unfairness," I need to remove the XOR branching and have all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation. So, no special branch for community affiliations.

From the description, the process has:

- Resume parsing and initial data check, which includes a loop for missing information.

- Preliminary skill assessment.

- Cultural fit & community affiliation check with potential bias.

- Managerial review and final decision.

There's also a loop in the initial stage for data completeness.

In POWL, I can use:

- Transitions for activities.

- OperatorPOWL for XOR and LOOP operators.

- StrictPartialOrder to define partial orders between nodes.

I should define activities like:

- ReceiveApplication

- DataCompletenessCheck (which might be part of the loop)

- RequestMoreInfo (for the loop)

- SkillAssessment

- CulturalFitCheck

- CommunityAffiliationCheck (only in the unfair model)

- ManagerialReview

- FinalDecision

Also, there might be silent transitions if needed, but I can stick to labeled transitions for clarity.

Let me outline the first model with unfairness.

Sequence:

1. Start with receiving application.

2. Then a loop for data completeness: check if data is complete, if not, request more info and loop back.

From the description: "Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check: An automated system scans resumes... Any missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details."

So, I can model this as a loop.

In POWL, a loop is defined with * (A, B), where you execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

For the loop part:

- A could be the data check.

- B could be requesting more info.

Typically, in a loop for checking completeness:

- Execute the check (A).

- If incomplete, execute request more info (B) and loop back to A.

In POWL loop operator * (A, B), it means: execute A, then you can choose to exit or execute B and then back to A.

But in this case, the decision to loop depends on the outcome of A.

In POWL, the loop operator doesn't specify a condition; it's just that after A, you can choose to exit or go to B and back.

I might need to model it with activities.

Perhaps define A as "PerformDataCheck", and B as "RequestMoreInfo".

But after data check, if incomplete, request more info and repeat the check.

Maybe it's better to have a single activity for the loop body.

I can have:

- A loop node where A is "DataCompletenessCheck", and B is "RequestMoreInfo".

Execute DataCompletenessCheck. If it's complete, exit; else, execute RequestMoreInfo and then back to DataCompletenessCheck.

Yes, that fits.

After the loop, if data is complete, proceed.

Then, SkillAssessment.

After SkillAssessment, in the unfair model, there's an XOR choice: one path to standard CulturalFitCheck, and another to CommunityAffiliationCheck.

From the description: "At this stage, the company attempts to gauge whether applicants align with the company’s values. However, the process is not purely merit-based. Applicants who indicate membership in the “Global Business Leaders Club” or are flagged as local residents receive a slight subjective uplift... This step is often an XOR choice: either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments."

So, explicitly, there's an XOR choice between two paths.

Then, after that, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

The XOR is part of the cultural fit stage.

Also, the ManagerialReview might depend on the outcome of the cultural fit.

From the description, after cultural fit, it goes to ManagerialReview.

Let me sketch the unfair model.

Nodes:

- ReceiveApplication: probably the start.

The description starts with submitting resumes, but I can have a transition for it.

Define the POWL graph.

Probably, the root is a StrictPartialOrder with several nodes connected in sequence, with operators inside.

First, after receiving application, there's the data check loop.

So, perhaps:

- Transition: ReceiveApplication

- Then, a loop operator: * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)

In the loop, DataCompletenessCheck might be the activity that decides, but in POWL, it's not conditional; it's just the structure.

I can model DataCompletenessCheck as an activity that includes the check, and if incomplete, it leads to requesting more info, but in POWL, I need to use the loop operator.

Following the POWL definition.

Define a loop node: loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

Where DataCompletenessCheck is a transition, and RequestMoreInfo is another transition.

In the loop * (A, B), execute A, then either exit or execute B and back to A.

So, for data completeness:

- Execute DataCompletenessCheck (which might set a flag, but in workflow terms, perhaps A is "CheckData", and if incomplete, go to B "RequestMoreInfo" and loop.

But after RequestMoreInfo, probably need to wait for the applicant to provide more info, but simplifying, assume that B includes providing info or something. But to keep it simple, I'll use two activities.

Perhaps DataCompletenessCheck is the activity that checks and if incomplete, triggers the request, but in POWL, it's better to have separate activities.

I'll define:

- A transition for DataCompletenessCheck

- A transition for RequestMoreInfo

And the loop is between them.

Then, after the loop exits (when data is complete), proceed to SkillAssessment.

Then, after SkillAssessment, an XOR choice between StandardCulturalFit and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

CommunityAffiliationCheck is the biased one.

From description: XOR between standard cultural fit or the affiliation check path.

Then, after the XOR, it should go to ManagerialReview and then FinalDecision.

Assuming that regardless of which branch, it converges back.

In the XOR, both branches lead to the same next step.

In POWL, the XOR is a node, and after choosing one child, it proceeds.

In the partial order, I need to connect after the XOR to the next nodes.

Similar to the example given.

Now, for the sequence.

Let me define the nodes for the unfair model.

First, define individual transitions:

- recv_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")

- data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")

- req_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

- skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

- std_cult_fit = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")

- comm_aff_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # biased one

- mgr_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

- final_dec = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

Now, the loop for data completeness: loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, req_info])

This loop should be after ReceiveApplication.

Then, after loop_data, SkillAssessment.

Then, XOR between std_cult_fit and comm_aff_check.

xor_cult = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[std_cult_fit, comm_aff_check])

Then, after xor_cult, ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

Now, to connect them in a partial order.

The root should be a StrictPartialOrder with nodes: recv_app, loop_data, skill_assess, xor_cult, mgr_review, final_dec

Add orders:

recv_app --> loop_data

loop_data --> skill_assess

skill_assess --> xor_cult

xor_cult --> mgr_review

mgr_review --> final_dec

In POWL, the order is between the nodes, which can be complex objects.

Yes.

Now, for the XOR, when it's executed, it chooses one of the children to execute.

Similarly for the loop.

In the loop, it will keep executing until exit.

Assuming that the loop exits when data is complete.

Now, for the unfairness, the XOR choice might be based on some condition, like affiliation, but in the workflow model, the XOR itself represents the choice point where bias can enter, perhaps in how the choice is made.

But in POWL, we don't model the decision logic, just the structure.

So, having the XOR there represents the potential for unfairness.

Now, for the second model without unfairness.

Similar structure, but no XOR for cultural fit.

Instead, all applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck.

So, probably, after SkillAssessment, directly to a single CulturalFitCheck, not branched.

Then to ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Also, keep the loop for data completeness.

So, nodes:

- recv_app

- loop_data (same as before)

- skill_assess

- cult_fit (a single transition, say "CulturalFitCheck")

- mgr_review

- final_dec

Partial order: recv_app --> loop_data --> skill_assess --> cult_fit --> mgr_review --> final_dec

No XOR.

In the unfair model, the cultural fit is split into two paths via XOR, while in fair model, it's a single path.

In the description, even in the fair model, it should be a standard cultural fit without the affiliation bias.

So, in the second model, just one activity for cultural fit.

Now, I need to write the POWL models in code, similar to the example.

Import the necessary modules.

Then define the transitions.

Then define the operators.

Then define the root StrictPartialOrder.

For the first model:

Define all transitions.

Then loop_data = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [data_check, req_info])

xor_cult = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [std_cult_fit, comm_aff_check])

Then root_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[recv_app, loop_data, skill_assess, xor_cult, mgr_review, final_dec])

Then add edges:

root_po.order.add_edge(recv_app, loop_data)

root_po.order.add_edge(loop_data, skill_assess)

root_po.order.add_edge(skill_assess, xor_cult)

root_po.order.add_edge(xor_cult, mgr_review)

root_po.order.add_edge(mgr_review, final_dec)

In POWL, the nodes in StrictPartialOrder can be other POWL models, so this should be fine.

Similarly for the second model.

Define the transitions first.

I need to make sure the labels are appropriate.

From the description, I can use:

- ReceiveApplication

- For the loop: DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo

- SkillAssessment

- For unfair: StandardCulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck

- For fair: CulturalFitCheck (single)

- ManagerialReview

- FinalDecision

In the fair model, I should use a label that doesn't imply bias, like "CulturalFitCheck".

In the unfair model, have two separate activities.

In the description, the XOR is between standard cultural fit or the community affiliation path, but both are part of cultural fit evaluation, but one is biased.

In POWL, I can label them accordingly.

Now, to write the code.

I need to produce two POWL models, probably as code snippets.

Since it's a response, I should write the Python code for both.

Looking back at the user message, it says "produce two POWL models", and in the example, it's code.

So, I'll write two code blocks.

First, for the unfair model.

Import statements:

import pm4py

from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition

from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

Then define the transitions.

To make it self-contained, I can define them within the model.

Similar to the example.

In the example, they define A, B, C, etc.

So, for unfair model:

# POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition

from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions

receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")

data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")

request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

std_cult_fit = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")

comm_aff_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # Biased activity

mgr_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

final_dec = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define operators

loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

xor_cult = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[std_cult_fit, comm_aff_check])

# Define the root partial order

root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, loop_data, skill_assess, xor_cult, mgr_review, final_dec])

# Add order edges

root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, loop_data)

root_unfair.order.add_edge(loop_data, skill_assess)

root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, xor_cult)

root_unfair.order.add_edge(xor_cult, mgr_review)

root_unfair.order.add_edge(mgr_review, final_dec)

In the loop, the children are data_check and request_info, which are transitions.

Similarly for XOR.

Now, for the fair model:

# POWL Model Without Unfairness

from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition

from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions

receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")

data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")

request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

cult_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Single, unbiased activity

mgr_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

final_dec = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define operators (only the loop)

loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Define the root partial order

root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, loop_data, skill_assess, cult_fit, mgr_review, final_dec])

# Add order edges

root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, loop_data)

root_fair.order.add_edge(loop_data, skill_assess)

root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cult_fit)

root_fair.order.add_edge(cult_fit, mgr_review)

root_fair.order.add_edge(mgr_review, final_dec)

In the fair model, I still have the loop, which is good.

In the unfair model, I have the XOR for cultural fit.

This captures the difference.

In the unfair model, the XOR choice might be based on some attribute, but in POWL, we don't specify how the choice is made, just that there is a choice point, which can introduce bias.

In the fair model, no such choice, all go through the same process.

I think this is appropriate.

To present it in the response, I can write:

For the POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:

[code block]

For the POWL Model Without Unfairness:

[code block]

And make sure to include the import statements, or perhaps assume they are imported.

In the example, they have the import in the code snippet.

So, I'll do the same.

Since the transitions are redefined, it's fine.

In Python, if I run this code, the variables might conflict, but since it's just for illustration, it's okay.

I think this should work.
</think>

Below is the response to your query. I have created two POWL models based on the provided description of the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. Both models use the POWL language (as defined in the pm4py library) to represent the workflow. The models include the key stages: receiving the application, a loop for data completeness (involving resume parsing and initial data checks), skill assessment, cultural fit evaluation, managerial review, and final decision.

- **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**: This model includes an XOR branching after the skill assessment. One branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation, while the other leads to a community affiliation check that can introduce bias (e.g., preferential treatment for certain affiliations). This reflects the potential for unfairness as described.
- **POWL Model Without Unfairness**: This model removes the XOR branching and ensures all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation without any special community-based path. The loop for data completeness and the sequential order of other tasks are preserved.

I have used appropriate activity labels from the description (e.g., "ReceiveApplication", "DataCompletenessCheck", "RequestMoreInfo" for the loop, "SkillAssessment", "CulturalFitCheck", "CommunityAffiliationCheck", "ManagerialReview", "FinalDecision"). The models are defined in Python code using the pm4py library, following the POWL structure provided in the instructions. Each model is self-contained with its own code snippet, including the necessary imports and definitions.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model represents a workflow where bias can creep in due to the XOR choice after the skill assessment. The XOR branch allows for a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" path that may favor applicants with certain affiliations (e.g., local community ties or specific clubs), as described in the process. The loop for data completeness is modeled using the LOOP operator, and the sequence of tasks is enforced through a partial order.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions for activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")  # Initial receipt of application
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")  # Check for missing information
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")  # Request additional details if incomplete
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")  # Online skill test for domain knowledge
std_cult_fit = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")  # Standard cultural fit evaluation
comm_aff_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # Biased cultural fit check with affiliation-based uplift
mgr_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")  # Human review by hiring manager
final_dec = Transition(label="FinalDecision")  # Approve or reject the candidate

# Define operators
# LOOP for data completeness: execute DataCompletenessCheck, then either exit or execute RequestMoreInfo and loop back
loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])
# XOR for cultural fit: exclusive choice between standard cultural fit or community affiliation check
xor_cult = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[std_cult_fit, comm_aff_check])

# Define the root partial order to enforce sequence
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, loop_data, skill_assess, xor_cult, mgr_review, final_dec])

# Add order edges to define the execution order (sequential flow)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, loop_data)  # Receive application before data completeness loop
root_unfair.order.add_edge(loop_data, skill_assess)  # Data completeness loop must finish before skill assessment
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, xor_cult)  # Skill assessment must finish before XOR cultural fit choice
root_unfair.order.add_edge(xor_cult, mgr_review)  # XOR cultural fit choice must finish before managerial review
root_unfair.order.add_edge(mgr_review, final_dec)  # Managerial review must finish before final decision

# The root_unfair object represents the complete POWL model with potential unfairness
```

In this model:
- The LOOP operator (`loop_data`) handles the iterative process for ensuring data completeness, as described in the "Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check" stage.
- The XOR operator (`xor_cult`) introduces the potential bias, as it allows for a choice between a standard path and a biased path based on community affiliations.
- The partial order ensures a sequential flow, but the XOR branch is where unfairness can manifest (e.g., through selective routing of candidates).

---

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model represents a fair workflow where all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation without any branching or special treatment for community affiliations. The XOR operator is removed, and a single "CulturalFitCheck" activity is used instead. The loop for data completeness and the sequential order of tasks are retained to maintain similarity with the original process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions for activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")  # Initial receipt of application
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")  # Check for missing information
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")  # Request additional details if incomplete
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")  # Online skill test for domain knowledge
cult_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Single, unbiased cultural fit evaluation for all applicants
mgr_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")  # Human review by hiring manager
final_dec = Transition(label="FinalDecision")  # Approve or reject the candidate

# Define operators
# LOOP for data completeness: execute DataCompletenessCheck, then either exit or execute RequestMoreInfo and loop back
loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Define the root partial order to enforce sequence (no XOR operator)
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, loop_data, skill_assess, cult_fit, mgr_review, final_dec])

# Add order edges to define the execution order (sequential flow)
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, loop_data)  # Receive application before data completeness loop
root_fair.order.add_edge(loop_data, skill_assess)  # Data completeness loop must finish before skill assessment
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cult_fit)  # Skill assessment must finish before cultural fit check
root_fair.order.add_edge(cult_fit, mgr_review)  # Cultural fit check must finish before managerial review
root_fair.order.add_edge(mgr_review, final_dec)  # Managerial review must finish before final decision

# The root_fair object represents the complete POWL model without unfairness
```

In this model:
- The LOOP operator (`loop_data`) is unchanged and handles the data completeness check as in the unfair model.
- The cultural fit stage is simplified to a single transition (`cult_fit`), ensuring all applicants are evaluated uniformly without any branching or bias.
- The partial order maintains a strict sequential flow, eliminating the source of potential unfairness from the XOR choice.

---

These POWL models accurately reflect the hiring process described, with the first model demonstrating where unfairness could arise (via the XOR branch) and the second model removing that potential bias by standardizing the cultural fit evaluation. If you need further modifications or visualizations (e.g., using pm4py to render the models), let me know!
