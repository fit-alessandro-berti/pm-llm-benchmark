The diagram is a business-process model drawn as a workflow net. Activities are represented by rounded squares containing a letter (used as an identifier) and the activity name. Small black dots represent control-flow connectors that implement different types of branching and synchronization. A legend at the lower right explains the notation: a single input splitting into multiple outputs can be an XOR-split (exclusive choice), AND-split (parallelization), or OR-split (inclusive choice); conversely, multiple incoming branches can be joined via XOR-join, AND-join, or OR-join.

Process description:
1. **a – register request** is the unique start activity.
2. From there the flow can go to several examination activities:
   - **b – examine thoroughly**
   - **c – examine casually**
   - **d – check ticket**
   - **f – reinitiate request**
   Multiple connectors indicate that these can be performed in different combinations, including loops that return to earlier tasks (e.g., from ‘reinitiate request’ back to the examinations).
3. The outcomes of these examinations converge on **e – decide**.
4. Decision leads to either:
   - **g – pay compensation**, or
   - **h – reject request**.
5. Both branches eventually converge on **z – end**.

The diagram emphasizes complex control logic, allowing for exclusive, parallel, or inclusive execution of tasks and multiple loops before the deciding activity.
