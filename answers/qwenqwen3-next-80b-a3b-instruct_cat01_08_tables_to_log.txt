To construct a **comprehensive event log** suitable for process mining, we will:

1. **Use `order_id` as the Case ID**.
2. **Derive events** from each table in logical, chronological order of the business process:
   - Order Created
   - Item Picked (one event per item picked, as each has a unique timestamp)
   - Order Dispatched (one per delivery record)
   - Order Arrived (one per delivery record)
   - Invoice Issued (one per invoice)
   - Payment Received (one per payment)
3. **Map timestamps** accurately from the source tables.
4. **Enrich with Resource/Actor** using the optional `Resources` table to map IDs to names.
5. **Ensure chronological order** across all events per case.
6. **Include additional attributes** where available (e.g., item_id, carrier, invoice_amount, payment_method).

---

### Assumptions:
- **Item Picking** is treated as individual events per item, since timestamps differ and each involves a different picker.
- **Delivery events** (dispatch and arrival) are treated as separate events per delivery record, even if multiple deliveries exist for one order (e.g., order 1002).
- **Invoices** may be issued after delivery and may be split (e.g., order 1002 has two invoices), so each invoice is an independent event.
- **Payments** are tied to invoices, not directly to orders, so we link via `invoice_id`.
- **Resource names** are resolved using the `Resources` table.
- **No events** are inferred beyond what the data explicitly provides (e.g., no “Order Approved” or “Inventory Checked” unless data exists).
- **Chronological order** is maintained per `order_id` by sorting all events by timestamp.

### Notes on Missing Data (Order 1004):

- **Order 1004** has an order and item picking, but **no delivery, invoice, or payment** recorded in the tables.
- In real-world process mining, missing downstream events may indicate process abandonment, system error, or data gap.
- To maintain completeness and traceability, we added placeholder events labeled:
  - “No Delivery Recorded”
  - “No Invoice Issued”
  - “No Payment Received”
- These are **not actual process activities** but are included to **preserve case integrity** and **prevent premature case closure** in analysis.
- The timestamp for these is set to the last known event (item picking) to indicate they are **expected but missing**.
- Alternatively, in some process mining tools, such cases can be flagged with a “completed with missing steps” marker — here, we represent this explicitly.
