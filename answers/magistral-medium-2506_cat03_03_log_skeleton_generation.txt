Here’s a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process, incorporating the given activities and constraints based on typical business logic in such a scenario:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    # Since no two activities are strictly equivalent in this scenario, this set is empty.
    # However, if two activities were always done together (e.g., Pack Order and Generate Shipping Label are sometimes combined),
    # they could be added here, but that is not the case here.

    'always_before': {
        ('PI', 'RI'),    # Must reserve items before picking them
        ('PO', 'PI'),    # Must pick items before packing
        ('GSL', 'PO'),   # Must pack before generating shipping label
        ('D', 'GSL'),    # Must generate shipping label before dispatching
        ('IC', 'D'),     # Typically, invoice is sent after dispatch (but this may vary)
        ('RP', 'IC'),    # Payment is recorded after invoice is sent
        ('CA', 'RO'),    # Must receive order before checking availability
        ('RI', 'CA'),    # Must check availability before reserving items
        ('QC', 'PI')     # Quality check follows picking
    },

    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),    # Receive Order is always before Check Availability (but since 'always_before' already covers this, we may not need it here)
        # Other 'always_after' relationships are often implied by 'always_before' constraints.
        # However, if we want to enforce that certain activities must follow others (without being strictly immediate), we can add them.
        # For example, Dispatch must happen after Pack Order (but this is already implied by 'always_before' for GSL and PO).
    },

    'never_together': {
        # Typically, no two activities in this process are mutually exclusive in the same case,
        # but if there were alternative paths (e.g., fast-track vs. standard), we might add constraints.
        # For this scenario, we assume all activities occur in every case (though some may be optional).
        # However, if some activities are mutually exclusive (e.g., "Express Dispatch" vs. "Standard Dispatch"),
        # they would be listed here.
        # Since no such activities are given, this set is empty.
    },

    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},       # Every order must start with Receive Order (exactly once)
        'CA': {1},       # Check Availability happens once per order
        'RI': {1},       # Reserve Items happens once per order
        'PI': {1},       # Pick Items happens once per order
        'QC': {0, 1},    # Quality Check may be skipped (0) or done once (1)
        'PO': {1},       # Pack Order happens once per order
        'GSL': {1},      # Generate Shipping Label happens once per order
        'D': {1},        # Dispatch happens once per order
        'IC': {1},       # Invoice Customer happens once per order
        'RP': {0, 1}     # Record Payment may not happen (0) if payment is pending, or once (1) if paid
    },

    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),    # Receive Order is directly followed by Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),    # Check Availability is directly followed by Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),    # Reserve Items is directly followed by Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),    # Pick Items is directly followed by Quality Check (if QC is performed)
        ('QC', 'PO'),    # Quality Check is directly followed by Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),   # Pack Order is directly followed by Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),    # Generate Shipping Label is directly followed by Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),     # Dispatch is directly followed by Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')     # Invoice Customer is directly followed by Record Payment (if payment is recorded)
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Constraints:
1. **Equivalence**: Empty, as no two activities are strictly equivalent.
2. **Always Before**:
   - Activities like `RI` (Reserve Items) must happen before `PI` (Pick Items).
   - `PO` (Pack Order) must happen before `GSL` (Generate Shipping Label), etc.
3. **Always After**:
   - Mostly implied by "always_before," but you could add some if needed.
4. **Never Together**: Empty, as all activities are expected to occur in a typical order fulfillment process (though some may be optional).
5. **Activity Frequencies**:
   - Most activities occur exactly once (`{1}`), but `QC` (Quality Check) and `RP` (Record Payment) can have 0 or 1 occurrence.
6. **Directly Follows**:
   - This defines the strict order of activities (e.g., `RO` is directly followed by `CA`).

### Adjustments:
- If `Quality Check (QC)` is mandatory, change its frequency to `{1}`.
- If some activities can repeat (e.g., `CA` might be retried if items are unavailable), adjust their frequency sets (e.g., `{'CA': {1, 2}}`).
- If there are alternative paths (e.g., some orders skip `QC`), the `never_together` set might include conflicting activities (none in this case).
