### Justification for Naming Choices

- **Initial Verification**: Indicates that this is the first check of the customer's documents. It is used in the beginning of the process and serves to confirm the customer's identity.
- **Outbound Call**: Signifies that the call is made to the customer to clarify issues or request more information, usually early in the process.
- **Re-Verification**: Specifies that this is a second verification after some action has been taken, such as the customer submitting additional documents or an adjustment being made.
- **Follow-Up Call**: Indicates that the call is made to check in on the customer after an issue or adjustment, confirming that the matter has been resolved.

These renamings clarify the roles and purposes of the activities within the context of the support workflow, making the log easier to understand and analyze.
