### Analysis of Recurrent Activities

After analyzing the event log, I identified the following activities that appear multiple times within the same case, along with their contextual differences:

1. **Verify Documents** (recurs in C001 and C003):
   - **First occurrence**: Initial verification of submitted/available documents (e.g., identity check at the start).
   - **Second occurrence**: Re-verification after additional documents are provided (C001) or after account adjustments (C003).

2. **Call Customer** (recurs in C002):
   - **First occurrence**: Initial outbound call for clarification (e.g., missing docs in C001, account discrepancy in C002, customer return in C003).
   - **Second occurrence** (C002 only): Follow-up call to confirm prior actions (e.g., adjustments).

**Activities that do not recur within cases**: `Initiate Request`, `Submit Additional`, `Adjust Account`, `Approve Request`. These have unique, consistent roles and retain their original names.

### Revised Event Log

The table below shows the full log with renamed activities. All other columns (Case ID, Timestamp, Resource, Additional Context) remain unchanged for fidelity.

| Case ID | Activity                  | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |

### Justification of Naming Choices

- **Initial Verify Documents** vs. **Re-Verify Documents**:
  - *Contextual clues*: First instance always follows `Initiate Request` and involves checking initially available/submitted docs (e.g., "Agent checks identity documents" in C001; "Physical verification of ID" in C003). Second instance follows resolution steps like `Submit Additional` (C001) or `Adjust Account` (C003), explicitly for re-checking (e.g., "now that ID scan is provided"; "after account adjustment"). Prefixes "Initial" and "Re-" disambiguate position and purpose while keeping names concise.

- **Initial Call Customer** vs. **Follow-up Call Customer**:
  - *Contextual clues*: First instance is always an outbound call to address an immediate issue post-verification (e.g., "request missing docs" in C001; "clarify account discrepancy" in C002; "have them return" in C003). The single second instance (C002) is explicitly a confirmation after `Adjust Account` ("Follow-up call to confirm adjustments"). Prefixes "Initial" and "Follow-up" capture sequence and intent; "Initial" is applied consistently to first calls across cases for uniformity, even if C001/C003 lack seconds.

These names are descriptive, process-flow oriented, and derived directly from timestamps, additional context, and preceding events, eliminating ambiguity without introducing external assumptions. Non-recurrent activities are unchanged as they are already unique.
