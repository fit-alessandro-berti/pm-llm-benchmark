## Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Performance

### 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

Based on the total time from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket":

**Fast Cases:**
- **Case 103**: 1 hour 20 minutes
- **Case 101**: 2 hours 15 minutes

**Slow Cases:**
- **Case 104**: 24 hours 10 minutes (10-18x slower than fast cases)
- **Case 102**: 25 hours 10 minutes (11-19x slower than fast cases)
- **Case 105**: 49 hours 5 minutes (22-37x slower than fast cases)

### 2. Root Causes of Performance Issues

#### **A. Escalation to Level-2 Agents**
- Cases 102 and 105 (the two slowest) both required escalation to Level-2 agents
- Case 105 experienced a 28-hour wait after escalation before investigation resumed
- Case 102 had a 2.5-hour wait after escalation

#### **B. Extended Investigation-to-Resolution Gaps**
All slow cases show ~19-hour gaps between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket":
- Case 102: 14:00 to 09:00 next day
- Case 104: 13:00 to 08:00 next day  
- Case 105: 14:00 to 09:00 next day

This suggests tickets investigated in the afternoon are not resolved until the next morning.

#### **C. Assignment-to-Investigation Delays**
- Case 104 waited 3.5 hours between assignment and investigation
- Cases with escalation show significant delays before Level-2 investigation begins

### 3. Insights and Recommendations

#### **Key Performance Bottlenecks:**

1. **Level-2 Agent Availability**: The 28-hour wait in Case 105 suggests severe resource constraints or poor queue management for escalated tickets.

2. **No After-Hours Support**: The consistent ~19-hour overnight gaps indicate no 24/7 support coverage, creating automatic delays for afternoon tickets.

3. **Workload Distribution**: Some Level-1 agents may be overloaded (Case 104's 3.5-hour wait to start investigation).

#### **Recommendations:**

1. **Implement Level-2 SLAs**: Set maximum wait times for escalated tickets and monitor Level-2 agent capacity.

2. **Extended Support Hours**: Consider extending support hours or implementing shift coverage to handle tickets initiated in the afternoon.

3. **Escalation Criteria Review**: Analyze whether some escalations could be avoided through better Level-1 training or documentation.

4. **Queue Management**: Implement priority queuing to ensure critical escalations don't wait 28+ hours.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track time between each process step to identify and address bottlenecks proactively.

The data clearly shows that escalations and time-of-day effects are the primary drivers of performance issues, with some tickets taking 30-40 times longer than the best-performing cases.
