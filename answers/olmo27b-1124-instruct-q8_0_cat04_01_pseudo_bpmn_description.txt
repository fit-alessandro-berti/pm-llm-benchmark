The provided pseudo-BPMN representation illustrates a business process involving the handling of customer requests at a service or sales department within an organization. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the process, gateways, and how tasks diverge based on conditions:

### **Business Process Overview**

1. **Start Event:** The process begins when a customer places a request.
2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
   - This task represents the initial step where the customer's request is acknowledged.

3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**
   - This gateway checks if the received request is standard or custom.
   - **[If Type = Standard]**: The process moves to Task B1 for standard validation.
   - **[If Type = Custom]**: The process moves to Task B2 for custom feasibility analysis.

4. **Task B1 / B2:** 
   - **B1 (Standard Validation):** Conducts credit check and inventory check if the request is standard.
   - **B2 (Custom Feasibility Analysis):** Performs a custom feasibility analysis if the request is custom.

5. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
   - This gateway ensures that all required checks are completed before proceeding.
   - If any check fails, it leads back to re-evaluate conditions via a loop back or to task H for sending a rejection notice.

6. **Task D / E1: "Calculate Delivery Date" / "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
   - For standard requests (via Task D), the delivery date is calculated.
   - For custom requests (via Task E1), a custom quotation is prepared.

7. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
   - This checks if the requester needs managerial approval before proceeding.
   - If yes, moves to Task F for obtaining approval.
   - If no, moves directly to task G.

8. **Task F / H: "Obtain Manager Approval" / "Send Rejection Notice"**
   - **F** (Approval Step): Moves forward if the manager grants approval.
   - **H** (Rejection Step): Sends a rejection notice if the custom request cannot be fulfilled or standard validation fails.

9. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
   - Determines whether to proceed with invoice generation or re-evaluation based on approval status.

10. **Task G / I: "Generate Final Invoice" / "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
    - **G** (Invoice Generation): Generates the final invoice if all steps have been successful and an approval has been granted.
    - **I** (Confirmation): Sends a confirmation to the customer once the invoice is generated.

### **Key Concepts and Conditions:**

- **Gateways:** Serve as decision points, determining the flow based on certain conditions (XOR for exclusive choices, AND for parallel execution).
- **Parallel Execution:** The "Run Parallel Checks" gateway ensures that multiple activities (credit check, inventory check, custom feasibility analysis) can happen simultaneously.
- **Loop Back:** If any task within the AND group fails (e.g., credit check fails), the process loops back to Task D or E1, depending on whether it was a standard or custom request.
- **Approval Trigger:** Approval is needed when a custom request type is found (via the XOR gateway) and must be obtained before moving forward with generating a custom quotation or invoice.

In summary, this process ensures that customer requests are systematically validated, assessed for feasibility, possibly require managerial approval based on complexity (custom requests), and ultimately result in either a confirmation of delivery or a rejection based on the request's fulfillment conditions.
