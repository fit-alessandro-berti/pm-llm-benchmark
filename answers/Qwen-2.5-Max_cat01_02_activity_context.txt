### Justification for Naming Choices

#### 1. **Initiate Request**
   - **Original Name:** `Initiate Request`
   - **Renamed To:**
     - `Initiate_Request_Online` (for cases initiated via the web portal)
     - `Initiate_Request_Branch` (for cases initiated at a physical branch)
   - **Reasoning:** The context of initiation differs based on whether the customer submits the request online or in person at a branch. Adding `_Online` or `_Branch` clarifies this distinction.

#### 2. **Verify Documents**
   - **Original Name:** `Verify Documents`
   - **Renamed To:**
     - `Verify_Documents_Initial` (first verification step)
     - `Verify_Documents_Final` (final verification after additional documents are submitted)
     - `Verify_Documents_Physical` (physical document verification at a branch)
     - `Verify_Documents_Post_Adjustment` (verification after internal adjustments)
   - **Reasoning:** The purpose of document verification changes depending on its position in the workflow. For example:
     - The first verification (`Initial`) is typically a preliminary check.
     - The final verification (`Final`) occurs after resolving any issues.
     - Physical verification (`Physical`) happens when the customer visits a branch.
     - Post-adjustment verification (`Post_Adjustment`) ensures accuracy after internal corrections.

#### 3. **Call Customer**
   - **Original Name:** `Call Customer`
   - **Renamed To:**
     - `Call_Customer_For_Missing_Docs` (to request missing documents)
     - `Call_Customer_For_Account_Discrepancy` (to clarify discrepancies in account details)
     - `Call_Customer_Confirmation` (to confirm adjustments or actions taken)
     - `Call_Customer_To_Return` (to ask the customer to return to the branch)
   - **Reasoning:** Each call serves a distinct purpose, as indicated by the "Additional Context" column. Renaming the activity to include the specific reason for the call removes ambiguity.

#### 4. **Adjust Account**
   - **Original Name:** `Adjust Account`
   - **Renamed To:** `Adjust_Account_Details`
   - **Reasoning:** This activity consistently involves making internal corrections to account details. Adding `_Details` clarifies that the adjustment pertains to account information rather than other types of adjustments.

#### 5. **Approve Request**
   - **Original Name:** `Approve Request`
   - **No Change Needed:** This activity has a consistent meaning across all cases and does not require renaming.

#### 6. **Submit Additional**
   - **Original Name:** `Submit Additional`
   - **Renamed To:** `Submit_Additional_Documents`
   - **Reasoning:** The term "Additional" is vague without context. Adding `_Documents` specifies that the customer is submitting supplementary documentation.

### Summary of Benefits
By renaming the activities, we achieve the following:
1. **Disambiguation:** Each activity name now clearly reflects its unique role in the process flow.
2. **Improved Traceability:** Analysts can easily track how different steps contribute to case resolution.
3. **Enhanced Clarity for Stakeholders:** The revised names make the process more understandable for non-technical stakeholders, such as managers or auditors.

This structured approach ensures that the event log accurately represents the nuances of the support workflow.
