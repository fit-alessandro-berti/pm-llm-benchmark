To produce the integrated event log, I have aligned events based on semantic meaning, `order_id` consistency, and temporal proximity.

### Integrated Event Log: Order Fulfillment Process (Order#1234)

| Timestamp (UTC) | Event Name (Unified) | Order ID | User ID | Resource ID | Notes / Metadata | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2023-10-10 09:59:58 | **Order Received** | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | Event captured at warehouse system | System A & B |
| 2023-10-10 10:01:29 | **Order Validated** | Order#1234 | u12 | r10 | Cross-check inventory | System A & B |
| 2023-10-10 10:02:05 | **Payment Processed**| Order#1234 | u12 | r99 | Payment gateway delay | System A & B |
| 2023-10-10 10:03:00 | **Quality Check** | Order#1234 | u45 | r11 | Random inspection | System B |
| 2023-10-10 10:05:02 | **Item Shipped** | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | Package handed to courier | System A & B |
| 2023-10-10 10:20:00 | **Item Delivered** | Order#1234 | — | — | — | System A |

### Integration Reasoning and Documentation

#### 1. Primary Timestamp Selection
I have prioritized the **System B timestamps** for the integrated log. 
*   **Reasoning:** System A is noted as having timestamps reflecting when events were *received* by the system, rather than when they occurred. System B's timestamps generally precede System A's (e.g., Order Received at 09:59:58 vs 10:00:00), suggesting System B is closer to the real-time execution of the task.

#### 2. Event Matching & Tolerance
*   **Strict Matches ( 2s):** 
    *   **Order Received:** (2s difference) Merged.
    *   **Order Validated/Validation:** (1s difference) Merged.
    *   **Item Shipped/Shipping:** (2s difference) Merged.
*   **The "Payment" Exception:** 
    *   There is a 5-second gap between System A (10:02:00) and System B (10:02:05). While this exceeds the 2-second guideline, I merged these records because "Payment Processed" and "PaymentCheck" are semantically identical in this workflow, and there are no other payment-related events in either log that would suggest these are two distinct activities. The System B note "Payment gateway delay" explains the slight timing irregularity.

#### 3. Handling Non-Overlapping Events
*   **Quality Check (10:03:00):** This event only appears in System B. It was included as a standalone record to ensure the "richer" data from System B is preserved.
*   **Item Delivered (10:20:00):** This event only appears in System A. It was included as it marks the completion of the process, which System B failed to capture.

#### 4. Attribute Enrichment
*   For all merged events, I unified the naming convention (using System A’s more descriptive names like "Order Validated" instead of "OrderValidation") while pulling the `user_id`, `resource_id`, and `notes` from System B.
*   Null values (—) were applied where an event existed only in System A and therefore lacked System B's specific metadata.
