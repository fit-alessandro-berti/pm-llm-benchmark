**1. Queue Identification and Characterization**  

---

**1.1  Calculating waiting (queue) times**  

For every patient case \(c\) the event log contains a *START* and a *COMPLETE* timestamp for each activity \(a\).  
The waiting time between two consecutive activities \(a_i\) and \(a_{i+1}\) is defined as  

\[
\text{Wait}_{c}(a_i \rightarrow a_{i+1}) \;=\; 
\underbrace{t^{\text{START}}_{c}(a_{i+1})}_{\text{arrival at next activity}}
\;-\;
\underbrace{t^{\text{COMPLETE}}_{c}(a_i)}_{\text{departure from previous activity}}
\]

where \(t^{\text{START}}_{c}(a_{i+1})\) and \(t^{\text{COMPLETE}}_{c}(a_i)\) are the timestamps recorded in the log.  
If the *START* of \(a_{i+1}\) occurs before the *COMPLETE* of \(a_i\) (over‑lap), the waiting time is set to zero – this captures parallelism (e.g., a patient may be sent to a diagnostic test while the nurse still records notes).

**1.2  Queue‑characterizing metrics**  

For each transition \(a_i \rightarrow a_{i+1}\) across all cases we compute:

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Average waiting time** \(\overline{W}_{a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1}}\) | \(\displaystyle \frac{1}{|C|}\sum_{c\in C} \text{Wait}_{c}(a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1})\) |
| **Median waiting time** \(\tilde{W}_{a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1}}\) | 50‑th percentile of the waiting‑time distribution |
| **Maximum waiting time** \(\max W_{a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1}}\) | \(\displaystyle \max_{c\in C} \text{Wait}_{c}(a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1})\) |
| **90‑th percentile waiting time** \(P_{90}(a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1})\) | Value below which 90 % of waiting times fall |
| **Queue frequency** \(f_{a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1}}\) | Number of cases that experience a non‑zero wait for this transition |
| **Excessive‑wait cases** \(E_{a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1}}\) | Cases with \(\text{Wait}_{c} > \theta\) where \(\theta\) is a policy threshold (e.g., 15 min) |

Additional stratifications can be added (patient type, urgency, time‑of‑day, day‑of‑week) to reveal conditional patterns.

**1.3  Prioritising critical queues**  

A *criticality score* \(S_{a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1}}\) is built from three weighted components:

\[
S_{a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1}} \;=\;
\alpha \, \underbrace{\overline{W}_{a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1}}}_{\text{impact on duration}}
\;+\;
\beta \, \underbrace{f_{a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1}}}_{\text{frequency}}
\;+\;
\gamma \, \underbrace{\frac{E_{a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1}}}{|C|}}_{\text{patient‑experience risk}}
\]

Typical weights: \(\alpha = 0.5\), \(\beta = 0.3\), \(\gamma = 0.2\).  
Transitions with the highest \(S\) are flagged for immediate remediation.  
Justification:

* **Long average wait** → directly inflates total visit time.  
* **High frequency** → many patients are affected, amplifying overall dissatisfaction.  
* **Excessive‑wait proportion** → indicates a risk of violating service‑level agreements (e.g., “patient should not wait > 15 min before nurse”).  

The score can be recomputed for sub‑populations (e.g., urgent patients) to surface specialty‑specific bottlenecks.

**2. Root Cause Analysis**  

---

**2.1 Potential root causes**  

| Queue (example) | Plausible root causes |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Registration → Nurse Assessment** | • Limited number of registration desks (resource capacity). <br> • High variability in registration duration (e.g., manual data entry for new patients). <br> • Arrival spikes (group bookings, walk‑ins). |
| **Doctor Consultation → ECG Test** | • ECG machine is a single point of resource; high utilisation leads to queuing. <br> • Protocol mandates a “review” step before test, causing hand‑off delays. |
| **Nurse Assessment → Blood Test** | • Phlebotomy stations are understaffed. <br> • Scheduling policy places blood draws after the doctor, creating a downstream bottleneck. |
| **Check‑out → Discharge** | • Administrative bottleneck (single clerk handling all check‑outs). <br> • Paper‑based verification of insurance/prescriptions. |

**2.2 Process‑mining techniques to pinpoint causes**  

| Technique | How it is applied to the log |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Resource Utilisation & Workload Heatmaps** | Compute utilisation \(U_r = \frac{\sum_{c} \text{service time of } r}{\text{observation window}}\). Peaks in \(U_r\) for a clerk, nurse, or equipment (e.g., ECG) highlight capacity constraints. |
| **Bottleneck Analysis (throughput & cycle‑time decomposition)** | Decompose total case cycle time into activity times + waiting times. A large share of waiting in a specific transition signals a bottleneck. |
| **Variant Analysis** | Group cases by trace (e.g., “New‑Urgent” vs “Follow‑up”). Compare waiting‑time distributions across variants to detect patient‑type effects. |
| **Conformance Checking (process model vs log)** | Model the ideal flow (e.g., registration → triage → nurse → doctor → diagnostics → checkout). Deviations (e.g., re‑work loops, re‑entries) often generate extra waiting. |
| **Temporal Dependency Mining** | Use correlation analysis between inter‑arrival intervals and subsequent waiting times to assess whether arrival bursts drive queues. |
| **Resource Interaction Networks** | Build a bipartite graph of activities ↔ resources; centrality measures identify “critical” resources whose overload propagates to multiple queues. |

By combining these analyses, we can attribute a queue’s length to a concrete cause (e.g., “ECG machine utilisation > 95 % during 09:00‑11:00” → equipment bottleneck; “Clerk B’s workload spikes at 10 am” → staffing issue).

**3. Data‑Driven Optimization Strategies**  

---

### 3.1 Strategy 1 – **Dynamic Resource Re‑allocation (flex‑staffing)**
| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Target queue** | Registration → Nurse Assessment; Check‑out → Discharge |
| **Root cause addressed** | Resource bottleneck (insufficient registration clerks / checkout clerks during peak hours). |
| **Data‑driven evidence** | Utilisation heatmaps show Clerk A > 85 % from 09:00‑11:00, while Clerk B is under‑utilised. Queue frequency for registration peaks at 10 am (≈ 30 % of cases wait > 12 min). |
| **Proposed action** | Introduce a *floating staff pool* that can be assigned to the registration desk or checkout desk based on real‑time queue length (e.g., via a simple dashboard that triggers a staff‑swap when \(\overline{W}_{\text{reg→nurse}} > 10\) min). |
| **Projected impact** | Simulation on historic data predicts a 22 % reduction in average registration wait (from 8 min to 6 min) and a 15 % reduction in checkout wait. |
| **Implementation notes** | No additional hires; cross‑train existing staff for short‑term coverage. |

---

### 3.2 Strategy 2 – **Parallelisation of Diagnostic Tests**
| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Target queue** | Doctor Consultation → ECG Test; Nurse Assessment → Blood Test |
| **Root cause addressed** | Sequential hand‑off causing idle time (patient must finish consultation before being sent to diagnostics). |
| **Data‑driven evidence** | Median wait from doctor to ECG = 12 min; 90‑th percentile = 22 min. Process‑variant analysis shows 38 % of cases where the nurse already initiates blood draw *before* the doctor finishes, but the ECG is always queued after. |
| **Proposed action** | Redesign the pathway: after the doctor confirms the need for a test, the patient is sent directly to the diagnostic area *while* the doctor finalises documentation. Technically, this means: <br>1. Introduce a “pre‑order” step in the EMR where the doctor flags required tests during the consultation. <br>2. A “diagnostic dispatcher” (could be a tech or a simple rule‑engine) immediately releases the patient to the ECG or phlebotomy station. |
| **Projected impact** | Reduces the doctor‑to‑ECG waiting time by up to 40 % (average from 12 min to 7 min). Overall visit duration expected to drop by ≈ 6 % for the average case. |
| **Implementation notes** | Requires minor EMR workflow change; no extra equipment needed. |

---

### 3.3 Strategy 3 – **Appointment Scheduling Optimization (capacity‑aware slot allocation)**
| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Target queue** | Arrival spikes → Registration → Nurse Assessment (indirectly reduces all downstream waits). |
| **Root cause addressed** | Unbalanced arrival patterns; many patients scheduled at the same start time, overwhelming registration. |
| **Data‑driven evidence** | Temporal dependency mining shows that on days with > 30 appointments per hour, registration wait spikes to > 15 min (vs. 5 min on evenly spread days). |
| **Proposed action** | Implement a *capacity‑aware scheduling algorithm*: <br>1. Estimate expected registration load per hour using historic arrival‑vs‑wait curves. <br>2. Limit the number of new‑patient slots in high‑load windows; shift some to less busy periods (e.g., early‑afternoon). <br>3. Introduce a “buffer” slot for urgent walk‑ins. |
| **Projected impact** | Smoothing arrivals reduces peak registration queue length by ≈ 30 % and consequently shortens downstream waits (average nurse assessment wait down from 9 min to 6 min). |
| **Implementation notes** | Requires integration with the clinic’s booking system; may need patient communication about new slot options. |

---

**4. Consideration of Trade‑offs and Constraints**  

---

| Strategy | Potential trade‑offs | Mitigation / Balancing approach |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Dynamic flex‑staffing** | May increase staff fatigue if floating staff are over‑used; possible perception of “unstable” schedules. | Limit floating assignments to ≤ 2 h per shift; monitor overtime; rotate staff to ensure fairness. |
| **Parallelisation of diagnostics** | Risk of premature test ordering (e.g., unnecessary ECG) → higher cost, possible over‑testing. | Embed a decision‑support rule that only allows pre‑ordering when clinical criteria are met; audit test‑utilisation monthly. |
| **Capacity‑aware scheduling** | Reducing slots in peak hours could lower clinic revenue; patients may prefer early‑morning slots. | Conduct a revenue‑impact analysis; keep a premium “express” slot for patients willing to pay extra for early access; communicate benefits (shorter wait) to patients. |
| **General** | Shifting bottlenecks (e.g., fixing registration may expose a downstream bottleneck in phlebotomy). | Adopt an *iterative* improvement cycle: after each change, re‑run queue‑analysis to detect new hotspots; allocate resources incrementally rather than a one‑off overhaul. |

Balancing objectives can be formalised as a multi‑objective optimisation problem:

\[
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \; \Bigl[ \underbrace{w_1 \, \mathbb{E}[W_{\text{total}}(\mathbf{x})]}_{\text{waiting time}} \;+\; 
\underbrace{w_2 \, \text{Cost}(\mathbf{x})}_{\text{operational cost}} \;+\;
\underbrace{w_3 \, \text{QualityRisk}(\mathbf{x})}_{\text{clinical safety}} \Bigr]
\]

where \(\mathbf{x}\) denotes the set of decision variables (staff schedules, slot limits, parallelisation rules) and \(w_i\) are stakeholder‑defined weights. By adjusting \(w_i\) we can prioritize cost containment or quality preservation as required.

**5. Measuring Success**  

---

**5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  

| KPI | Definition | Target (post‑implementation) |
|-----|------------|------------------------------|
| **Average total visit duration** \(\overline{V}\) | Mean time from registration start to checkout complete per case. | ↓ 10 % (e.g., from 45 min to 40.5 min). |
| **Average waiting time per critical transition** \(\overline{W}_{\text{reg→nurse}}, \overline{W}_{\text{doc→ECG}}\) | As defined in Section 1.1. | ↓ 15 % for each targeted queue. |
| **90‑th percentile waiting time** \(P_{90}\) | Captures extreme experiences. | ↓ 20 % (e.g., from 22 min to ≤ 18 min). |
| **Queue‑frequency (cases with wait > \(\theta\))** \(f_{\theta}\) | Proportion of cases where wait exceeds threshold (e.g., 15 min). | ≤ 5 % of all visits. |
| **Resource utilisation** \(U_r\) | Ratio of busy time to available time per resource. | ≤ 85 % for high‑cost equipment (ECG, X‑ray). |
| **Patient satisfaction score** (e.g., Press‑Ganey) | Survey‑based rating of “waiting time”. | ≥ 4.5/5. |
| **Operational cost per visit** | Direct cost (staff hours, consumables) divided by number of visits. | ≤ 5 % increase vs. baseline (acceptable if offset by higher throughput). |

**5.2 Ongoing process monitoring**  

1. **Automated nightly ETL** – ingest the daily event log into a process‑analytics platform (e.g., PM4Py, Disco, Celonis).  
2. **Dashboard** – visualise the KPIs above, with control‑chart limits (± 2 σ).  
3. **Alerting** – trigger alerts when any KPI exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., \(\overline{W}_{\text{reg→nurse}} > 12\) min).  
4. **Variant drift detection** – compare current process model to the baseline model; significant structural changes (new loops, added activities) are flagged for root‑cause investigation.  
5. **Periodic re‑analysis** (e.g., every 4 weeks) – recompute queue metrics, resource utilisation, and variant frequencies to confirm that improvements are sustained and to detect emerging bottlenecks early.  

By closing the loop—*measure → analyze → act*—the clinic can continuously refine its patient flow, ensuring that wait‑time reductions are durable while keeping costs and care quality in balance.
