### Proposed High-Level Activities

The event sequences for both CaseID A1 and B2 follow an identical pattern, indicating a standardized manufacturing workflow for metal sheet processing (likely forming a simple frame or bracket). I grouped low-level events based on the following criteria:
- **Temporal proximity**: Events occurring within ~10-15 seconds of each other without significant gaps (e.g., >30-second pauses indicate phase transitions).
- **Logical coherence**: Events forming a self-contained sub-process (e.g., all preparatory actions for material setup, or tool pickup immediately followed by usage).
- **Resource patterns**: Shared resources or resource types (e.g., Operator A for initial handling, Operator B for welding).
- **Domain semantics**: Activities aligning with typical manufacturing stages (preparation  assembly  finishing  inspection).

This results in **4 high-level steps** per case, reducing ~12 low-level events to concise stages. The groupings are consistent across cases.

#### 1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Grouped Events**:
     | CaseID | Timestamp Range | Activities |
     |--------|-----------------|------------|
     | A1     | 08:00:05 - 08:00:20 | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet |
     | B2     | 08:00:05 - 08:00:25 | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet |
   - **Rationale**: These initial events form a distinct preparation phase for the raw material. Operator A handles retrieval, identification (barcode scan for traceability), and placement; Robot Arm #2 and Heating Unit #1 then perform automated alignment and preheating. They are temporally clustered (15-20 seconds), logically sequential (position before heat), and prerequisite for downstream steps. This stage ensures the metal sheet is ready for assembly.

#### 2. **Welding Assembly**
   - **Grouped Events**:
     | CaseID | Timestamp Range | Activities |
     |--------|-----------------|------------|
     | A1     | 08:01:00 - 08:01:20 | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B, Measure weld integrity |
     | B2     | 08:01:03 - 08:01:22 | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B, Measure weld integrity |
   - **Rationale**: This captures the core assembly phase where Operator B equips the tool and performs spot welds on specific corners, immediately followed by automated sensor validation. The ~20-second cluster post-prep gap, shared Operator B resource, and direct logical flow (tool pickup  welds  integrity check) justify inclusion of the measurement as an inline quality gate within assembly, preventing defects from propagating.

#### 3. **Protective Coating**
   - **Grouped Events**:
     | CaseID | Timestamp Range | Activities |
     |--------|-----------------|------------|
     | A1     | 08:01:30 - 08:01:45 | Apply protective coating, Dry coating |
     | B2     | 08:01:35 - 08:01:50 | Apply protective coating, Dry coating |
   - **Rationale**: These events represent a finishing treatment phase to protect the welded product. Coating Unit #3 applies the layer, followed instantly by Heating Unit #2 drying it. Tight temporal linkage (~15 seconds), shared purpose (surface protection), and machine-centric resources make this a coherent post-assembly step.

#### 4. **Final Quality Inspection**
   - **Grouped Events**:
     | CaseID | Timestamp Range | Activities |
     |--------|-----------------|------------|
     | A1     | 08:02:00 | Visual check |
     | B2     | 08:02:05 | Visual check |
   - **Rationale**: The concluding human-led visual verification by Operator C serves as the end-of-line quality assurance, confirming overall product readiness. It stands alone due to its distinct resource (Operator C), later timestamp (~15 seconds after drying), and role as a final gate before potential packaging/shipping.

### Summary Benefits
- **Process Visualization**: The workflow is now `Material Preparation  Welding Assembly  Protective Coating  Final Quality Inspection`, enabling high-level process mining, bottleneck analysis (e.g., prep-weld gap), or conformance checking.
- **Scalability**: These rules (temporal/logical/resource clustering) can be applied to the full log for automation (e.g., via rule-based aggregation in tools like ProM or Celonis).
- **Coverage**: 100% of events grouped; no overlaps or orphans.
