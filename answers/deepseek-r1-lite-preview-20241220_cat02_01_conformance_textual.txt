**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Normative Process:**
   - **Starts with:** "Receive order."
   - **Next:** "Check inventory."
   - **If inventory is sufficient:**
     - "Authorize payment" after "Check inventory."
     - "Package items" after "Authorize payment."
     - "Ship order" after "Package items."
     - "Close order" after "Ship order."
   - **If inventory is insufficient:**
     - "Cancel order" after "Check inventory."
     - "Close order" after "Cancel order."
   - **Constraints:**
     - "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."
     - "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
     - "Ship order" must occur after "Package items" and never after "Cancel order."
     - "Close order" is the final activity in all scenarios.

2. **Analyzing Each Case in the Event Log:**

   - **Case 1:**
     - Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order
     - **Conclusion:** Follows the normative process correctly.

   - **Case 2:**
     - Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Package items → Authorize payment → Ship order → Close order
     - **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which is a deviation from the required sequence.
     - **Explanation:** According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" should happen before "Package items."

   - **Case 3:**
     - Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Cancel order → Ship order → Close order
     - **Violations:**
       - "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order," which is incorrect if inventory is insufficient.
       - "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which is not allowed.
     - **Explanation:** If inventory is insufficient, after "Check inventory," the process should go directly to "Cancel order" and then to "Close order" without authorizing payment or shipping the order.

   - **Case 4:**
     - Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Cancel order → Close order
     - **Conclusion:** Follows the normative process correctly for insufficient inventory.

   - **Case 5:**
     - Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Ship order → Close order
     - **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs without "Package items," which violates the required sequence.
     - **Explanation:** "Ship order" should only happen after "Package items."

**Final Answer:**

- **Case 2:** Violates the normative process by performing "Package items" before "Authorize payment."
- **Case 3:** Violates the normative process by authorizing payment and shipping after canceling the order, which is not allowed.
- **Case 5:** Violates the normative process by shipping the order without first packaging the items.

These deviations from the intended process flow indicate non-compliance with the established rules for handling orders, as outlined in the normative description.
