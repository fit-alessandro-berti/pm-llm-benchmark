This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the process for "Dispatch of goods" at a "Computer Hardware Shop." The process involves three main departments or roles, represented by lanes: **Logistics**, **Secretary**, and **Warehouse**.

Here is a step-by-step description of the process flow:

1.  **Process Start:** The process begins in the "Secretary" lane with a start event labeled "Ship goods."

2.  **Parallel Activities:** Immediately, the process splits into two parallel flows using a parallel gateway:
    *   **Warehouse Flow:** The process proceeds to the "Package goods" task in the "Warehouse" lane. Attached to this task is a 48-hour timer event; if packaging takes longer than 48 hours, a "Notify customer about delay" task is triggered.
    *   **Secretary Flow:** Simultaneously, the process proceeds to the "Clarify shipment method" task in the "Secretary" lane.

3.  **Shipment Handling Decision:** After clarifying the shipment method, an exclusive gateway (a decision point) asks, "Special handling?".
    *   **If Yes (Special Handling):** The secretary must "Get 3 offers from logistic companies" and then "Select logistic company and place order."
    *   **If No (Standard Handling):** The secretary checks "Order details" and "Customer information" to "Check if insurance is required."
        *   If insurance is necessary, the flow moves to an event-based gateway which appears to trigger two parallel tasks: "Insure parcel" (performed by Logistics) and "Write package label" (performed by the Secretary).
        *   If insurance is not required, the process likely skips the insurance step and proceeds directly to "Write package label."
        *   The paths for insuring the parcel and writing the label merge before joining the main flow.

4.  **Process Synchronization:** The separate flows from the Warehouse (packaging complete) and the Secretary/Logistics (shipping arrangements complete) converge at a parallel join gateway in the Warehouse lane. This means the process will only continue once both the goods are packaged AND the shipping method and paperwork are arranged.

5.  **Final Steps:** After synchronization, the process remains in the "Warehouse" lane for the final tasks:
    *   "Fill out Shipment paperwork."
    *   "Move package to pickup area."

6.  **Process End:** The process concludes with an end event labeled "Shipment prepared," signifying that the package is ready for pickup by the logistics company.
