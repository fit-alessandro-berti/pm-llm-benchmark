This image is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** that illustrates the "Dispatch of goods" process for a "Computer Hardware Shop". The diagram uses swimlanes to divide responsibilities among different departments or roles: **Logistics**, **Secretary**, and **Warehouse**.

Here is a step-by-step description of the process flow:

1.  **Process Start:** The process begins with the "Ship goods" start event in the Secretary's swimlane.

2.  **Parallel Activities:** The flow immediately splits into two parallel paths using a parallel gateway:
    *   **Path 1 (Warehouse):** The "Package goods" task begins. This task has a 48-hour timer attached. If the task exceeds 48 hours, a non-interrupting timer event triggers the "Notify customer about delay" task.
    *   **Path 2 (Secretary):** The "Clarify shipment method" task is initiated.

3.  **Shipment Handling Decision:** After clarifying the shipment method, a decision (exclusive gateway) is made based on whether "Special handling" is required.
    *   **If Yes (Special Handling):** The Secretary must "Get 3 offers from logistic companies" and then "Select logistic company and place order".
    *   **If No (Special Handling):** The Secretary proceeds to "Check if insurance is required," using "Order details" and "Customer information" data inputs.

4.  **Insurance and Labeling:** After the insurance check, an event-based gateway determines the next steps:
    *   One path, labeled "always," leads to the "Write package label" task performed by the Secretary.
    *   If insurance is deemed necessary, a parallel path is taken to the **Logistics** swimlane, where the "Insure parcel" task is completed.
    *   After the label is written and the parcel (if necessary) is insured, these two paths merge.

5.  **Synchronization and Final Steps:**
    *   All the upper-level administrative tasks (from both the special handling and regular handling paths) and the lower-level "Package goods" task must be completed before the process can continue. This is shown by a large parallel gateway that merges the flows from the Warehouse and Secretary lanes.
    *   Once synchronized, the process moves back to the **Warehouse** lane for the final steps: "Fill out Shipment paperwork" and then "Move package to pickup area".

6.  **Process End:** The process concludes with the "Shipment prepared" end event.

In summary, this diagram visualizes a coordinated workflow between a secretary, a warehouse, and a logistics department to prepare goods for shipment. It includes parallel processing, decision-making based on shipment requirements, time-based alerts for delays, and clear synchronization points to ensure all necessary tasks are completed before the shipment is ready.
