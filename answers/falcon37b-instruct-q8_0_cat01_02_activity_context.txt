**Justification for Renamed Activities:**

1. **Verify Identity Docs  Verify Identity Docs (Initial/Initial Check):** The first instance of Verify Documents in each case generally pertains to the initial verification process, hence the label "Initial/Initial Check."

2. **Verify Identity Docs  Final Verify Docs:** The second instance of Verify Documents, especially where additional context is given about the upload or adjustment of documents, signifies a final verification step after changes have been made.

3. **Call Customer  Outreach Call:** This name reflects that the purpose is to make an initial contact with the customer, possibly to obtain missing information or verify incomplete data.

4. **Call Customer  Follow-up Call:** The second instance of "Call Customer" often involves checking on the outcome of previous actions, such as confirming adjustments made or verifying compliance with requested changes.

5. **Verify Documents  Verify Physical ID:** For the walk-in case at a branch, the verification process is specifically physical and immediate upon arrival.

6. **Adjust Account  Internal Adjustment:** This reflects that the adjustment takes place within the company's systems, likely based on the outcome of an external call or after additional documentation has been uploaded.

Each renamed activity aims to provide clarity about the specific phase or context of the process it represents, thus enhancing the traceability and understanding of the workflow.
