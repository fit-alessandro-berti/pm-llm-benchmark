## Step 1: Calculate the Lead Time for Each Case
To identify cases with performance issues, we first need to calculate the lead time for each case. The lead time is the duration from the start of the case (submission of the claim) to its end (close of the claim).

## Step 2: Extract Case Details and Calculate Durations
- **Case 2001**: 
  - Start: 2024-04-01 09:00
  - End: 2024-04-01 10:30
  - Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes
- **Case 2002**: 
  - Start: 2024-04-01 09:05
  - End: 2024-04-02 11:00
  - Duration: 1 day, 1 hour 55 minutes
- **Case 2003**: 
  - Start: 2024-04-01 09:10
  - End: 2024-04-03 09:30
  - Duration: 2 days
- **Case 2004**: 
  - Start: 2024-04-01 09:20
  - End: 2024-04-01 10:45
  - Duration: 1 hour 25 minutes
- **Case 2005**: 
  - Start: 2024-04-01 09:25
  - End: 2024-04-04 14:30
  - Duration: 3 days, 5 hours 5 minutes

## 3: Identify Cases with Performance Issues
Cases with significantly longer durations are likely to have performance issues. 
- **Case 2003** and **Case 2005** seem to take longer than others, but we need to quantify "significantly longer" by comparing durations.

## 4: Analyze Attributes for Root Causes
Looking at the cases:
- **Case 2001**: Quick process, completed within 1.5 hours.
- **Case 2002**: Took 1 day, 1 hour 55 minutes.
- **Case 2003**: Took 2 days.
- **Case 2004**: Completed quickly, within 1 hour 25 minutes.
- **Case 2005**: Took 3 days, 5 hours 5 minutes.

## 5: Correlate Attributes with Lead Times
- **Case 2003** and **Case 2005** have high complexity and involve multiple requests for additional documents.
- **Case 2005** involves multiple requests for additional documents and has a high complexity level.

## 6: Determine Potential Root Causes
- **Complexity**: Cases with high complexity (e.g., 2003, 2005) seem to take longer.
- **Resource Handling**: Certain resources seem to handle cases longer, possibly due to workload or expertise.
- **Region**: While not directly comparable without more data, region B seems to have longer durations for some cases.

## 7: Propose Explanations and Mitigations
- **High Complexity Claims**: These are taking longer to process. Implementing a more efficient review process or assigning more experienced resources could help.
- **Multiple Requests for Additional Documents**: Cases requiring additional documents are taking longer. Streamlining the documentation process or providing clearer guidelines could help.
- **Resource Allocation**: Certain resources or regions might be more efficient. Cross-training or redistributing workload could mitigate issues.

## 8: Specific Analysis
- **Case 2003** and **Case 2005** have high complexity and took longer than others.
- **Case 2005** had multiple requests for additional documents and took 3 days to complete, indicating potential inefficiencies in the evaluation or approval process.

## 9: Conclusion and Suggestions
- Cases with high complexity or those requiring additional documentation are taking longer.
- Propose:
  1. **Streamline Additional Document Requests**: Implement a more efficient system for handling and verifying additional documents needed.
  2. **Resource Optimization**: Ensure that resources are allocated based on case complexity and workload.
  3. **Training and Process Review**: Provide training on efficient claim processing and review procedures to reduce lead times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2003, 2005}$
