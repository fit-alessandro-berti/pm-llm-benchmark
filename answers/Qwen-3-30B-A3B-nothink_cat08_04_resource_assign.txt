# **Process Improvement Plan for TechSolve Solutions: Data-Driven Resource Assignment Optimization**

---

## **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

### **Agent and Tier Performance Analysis**

To understand the performance and behavior of agents and support tiers, the following **metrics and process mining techniques** would be used:

### **Key Metrics for Agent and Tier Analysis:**

- **Workload Distribution**:  
  - Number of tickets per agent/tier (daily/weekly)
  - Average time spent per ticket (L1, L2, L3)
  - Ticket resolution time per agent/tier
  - First-call resolution (FCR) rate for L1 agents (e.g., % of tickets resolved without escalation)

- **Skill Utilization**:  
  - Frequency of tickets handled by agents with matching vs. non-matching skills
  - Percentage of tickets requiring specialized skills that are resolved by non-specialists
  - Time spent on tickets requiring skills not aligned with agent expertise

- **Escalation and Reassignment Patterns**:  
  - Frequency of escalations from L1 to L2/L3
  - Number of reassignments per ticket
  - Time delay introduced by reassignments

- **Ticket Type and Skill Affinity**:  
  - Which agents handle which categories/skills most frequently
  - How often agents are assigned to tasks outside their documented skill set

### **Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Analysis**

- **Resource Interaction Analysis**:  
  - Identify which agents interact most frequently with which ticket types.
  - Reveal patterns of handovers between tiers (e.g., L1 to L2, L2 to L3) and frequency of reassignments.

- **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**:  
  - Map the flow of tickets between agents and tiers to uncover "bottlenecks" or "super-connectors" in the process.
  - Identify agents who frequently receive or send tickets, indicating potential workload imbalances.

- **Role Discovery**:  
  - Use process mining tools (e.g., Disco, ProM) to discover the actual roles of agents based on their activity patterns.
  - Compare with the intended role (L1, L2, L3) to detect mismatches.

- **Conformance Checking**:  
  - Compare the actual process flow (as captured in the event log) with the expected process model (e.g., from policy or documentation).
  - Identify deviations such as incorrect initial assignments, unnecessary escalations, or reassignments.

### **Skill Utilization Analysis**

- **Skill Matching Analysis**:  
  - For each ticket, compare the required skill with the agent’s assigned skills.
  - Calculate the **skill match ratio** (e.g., 80% of tickets assigned to agents with the required skill).

- **Skill Over-Utilization/Under-Utilization**:  
  - Identify if certain agents (especially L2/L3) are frequently assigned to tasks that do not require their advanced skills.
  - Compare skill usage across tiers to detect inefficiencies.

---

## **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

### **Key Bottlenecks to Identify:**

- **Skill Shortages**:  
  - Tickets requiring rare skills (e.g., DB-SQL, Security-IAM) may be delayed due to lack of available agents.

- **Frequent Reassignments**:  
  - Tickets that are reassigned multiple times may indicate poor initial assignment or lack of skill matching.

- **Incorrect Initial Assignments**:  
  - Tickets assigned to L1 agents that require L2/L3 skills (e.g., network firewall issues assigned to L1) may lead to unnecessary escalations.

- **Overloaded Agents**:  
  - Agents with high ticket volume but low resolution rates may be overworked or under-skilled.

- **SLA Breaches Correlation**:  
  - Analyze whether SLA breaches are more common for tickets assigned to agents with mismatched skills or in certain tiers.

### **Quantifying the Impact of Issues**

- **Average Delay per Reassignment**:  
  - Calculate the average time added to resolution due to reassignments (e.g., 2 hours per reassignment).

- **Percentage of SLA Breaches Linked to Skill Mismatch**:  
  - Cross-reference SLA breaches with skill mismatch data to determine how many were caused by inappropriate assignment.

- **Overloaded Agent Impact**:  
  - Calculate the percentage of tickets handled by overloaded agents and the average resolution time for those tickets.

- **Escalation Rate by Ticket Type**:  
  - Identify which ticket types are most frequently escalated and the average time to resolution post-escalation.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes Identified from the Data:**

- **Ineffective Assignment Rules (e.g., Round-Robin)**:  
  - Current assignment logic may ignore agent skill sets and workload, leading to mismatches and delays.

- **Incomplete or Inaccurate Agent Skill Profiles**:  
  - Agents may be misclassified or have outdated skill records, leading to incorrect assignments.

- **Poor Ticket Categorization**:  
  - Inaccurate or inconsistent ticket categorization may lead to incorrect skill matching and assignment.

- **Lack of Real-Time Workload Visibility**:  
  - Without real-time data on agent availability, assignments may be made to overburdened agents.

- **L1 Agent Over-Escalation**:  
  - L1 agents may escalate tickets unnecessarily due to lack of training or empowerment, leading to L2/L3 agents being overburdened.

### **Using Process Mining to Identify Root Causes**

- **Variant Analysis**:  
  - Compare tickets with smooth assignment paths (no reassignments) vs. those with multiple reassignments.
  - Identify common factors (e.g., skill mismatch, incorrect category, agent skill profile) that differentiate these cases.

- **Decision Mining**:  
  - Use decision mining techniques to model the decision logic behind assignments (e.g., when is a ticket escalated to L2 vs. L1?).
  - Identify if decisions are based on skill, priority, or other factors.

- **Process Model Discovery**:  
  - Build a process model from the event log to visualize the actual flow of tickets.
  - Compare with the intended process model to detect deviations and inefficiencies.
