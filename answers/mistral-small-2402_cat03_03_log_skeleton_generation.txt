Sure, here's an example of a Log Skeleton model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('Order_Submission', 'Order_Confirmation')},
    'always_before': {('Order_Submission', 'Payment_Processing'), ('Payment_Processing', 'Invoice_Verification'), ('Invoice_Verification', 'Payment_Completion')},
    'always_after': {('Order_Confirmation', 'Payment_Processing'), ('Payment_Processing', 'Invoice_Creation'), ('Invoice_Verification', 'Payment_Completion')},
    'never_together': {('Order_Submission', 'Payment_Completion'), ('Payment_Processing', 'Order_Confirmation')},
    'activ_freq': {'Order_Submission': {1}, 'Order_Confirmation': {1}, 'Payment_Processing': {1}, 'Invoice_Creation': {1}, 'Invoice_Verification': {1}, 'Payment_Completion': {1}},
    'directly_follows': {('Order_Submission', 'Order_Confirmation'), ('Order_Confirmation', 'Payment_Processing'), ('Payment_Processing', 'Invoice_Creation'), ('Invoice_Creation', 'Invoice_Verification'), ('Invoice_Verification', 'Payment_Completion')}
}
```

In this model, the Purchase-to-Pay process includes the following activities: Order Submission, Order Confirmation, Payment Processing, Invoice Creation, Invoice Verification, and Payment Completion. The declarative constraints are defined as follows:

- Order Submission is equivalent to Order Confirmation (they always occur together).
- Payment Processing always occurs after Order Submission and before Invoice Verification.
- Invoice Verification always occurs after Payment Processing and before Payment Completion.
- Order Confirmation and Payment Processing, as well as Order Submission and Payment Completion, never occur together.
- Each activity occurs exactly once in a case.
- Each activity directly follows the previous one in the sequence.
