Here’s a Python dictionary representing a plausible temporal profile for the given global supply chain process. The values are estimated based on typical delays in such processes, with standard deviations reflecting variability due to factors like supplier reliability, production bottlenecks, or logistical delays.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (43200, 7200),    # ~12 hours avg, 2h std (quick supplier selection)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),   # ~7 days avg, 1 day std (supplier lead time)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 1800),      # ~1 hour avg, 0.5h std (immediate inspection)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (7200, 3600),     # ~2 hours avg, 1h std (assembly prep)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (10800, 5400),     # ~3 hours avg, 1.5h std (testing setup)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 1800),     # ~1 hour avg, 0.5h std (packaging)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (1800, 900),      # ~0.5 hours avg, 0.25h std (warehouse storage)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 10800),   # ~1 day avg, 3h std (distribution scheduling)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (259200, 43200),  # ~3 days avg, 12h std (post-sale support)

    # Indirectly connected activities (skipping intermediate steps)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (648000, 90000),   # ~7.5 days avg, 1 day std (selection to receipt)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (613200, 87600),  # ~7 days avg, 1 day std (order to inspection)
    ('RC', 'CA'): (10800, 5400),     # ~3 hours avg, 1.5h std (receipt to assembly)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (14400, 7200),     # ~4 hours avg, 2h std (inspection to testing)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (14400, 7200),    # ~4 hours avg, 2h std (assembly to packaging)
    ('PT', 'WS'): (5400, 2700),     # ~1.5 hours avg, 0.75h std (testing to storage)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (90000, 12960),    # ~1 day avg, 3.6h std (packaging to distribution)
    ('WS', 'AS'): (267000, 45600),  # ~3.1 days avg, 12.6h std (storage to support)
    ('SS', 'AS'): (2629200, 432000), # ~30.5 days avg, 12h std (selection to support)
}
```

### Notes:
1. **Direct Pairs**: These reflect immediate transitions (e.g., `OP`  `RC` with supplier lead time).
2. **Indirect Pairs**: These account for cumulative delays across multiple steps (e.g., `SS`  `AS` spans the entire process).
3. **Standard Deviations**: Reflect variability due to factors like supplier delays, quality issues, or logistical hiccups.
4. **Units**: All times are in seconds for consistency (e.g., 86400 = 1 day).

This profile captures both local and global temporal dependencies in the supply chain. Adjustments can be made based on domain-specific data.
