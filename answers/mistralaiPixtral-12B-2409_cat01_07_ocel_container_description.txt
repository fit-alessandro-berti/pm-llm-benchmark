The provided data appears to represent an object-centric event log detailing the processes involved in logistics and supply chain management. The event log includes various object types such as Handling Unit, Truck, Container, Vehicle, Forklift, Customer Order, and Transport Document. Each object type undergoes a series of events, and the directly follows relationships between these events are recorded along with their frequencies and durations.

Here's a breakdown of the process underlying this data:

7. **Reschedule Container** followed by **Book Vehicles**: Containers are rescheduled and vehicles are booked.
8. **Reschedule Container** followed by **Load to Vehicle**: Containers are rescheduled and then loaded onto the vehicle.
9. **Load to Vehicle** followed by **Book Vehicles**: Goods are loaded onto the vehicle and then vehicles are booked.
10. **Load to Vehicle** followed by **Depart**: Goods are loaded onto the vehicle and the vehicle departs.

### Forklift
1. **Bring to Loading Bay** followed by **Load to Vehicle**: Forklift brings goods to the loading bay and loads them onto the vehicle.
2. **Weigh** followed by **Place in Stock**: Forklift weighs the goods and places them in stock.
3. **Load to Vehicle** followed by **Bring to Loading Bay**: Forklift loads goods onto the vehicle and brings them to the loading bay.
4. **Place in Stock** followed by **Weigh**: Forklift places goods in stock and then weighs them.
5. **Load to Vehicle** followed by **Weigh**: Forklift loads goods onto the vehicle and then weighs them.
6. **Place in Stock** followed by **Bring to Loading Bay**: Forklift places goods in stock and then brings them to the loading bay.
7. **Bring to Loading Bay** followed by **Weigh**: Forklift brings goods to the loading bay and then weighs them.
8. **Weigh** followed by **Load to Vehicle**: Forklift weighs the goods and loads them onto the vehicle.
9. **Weigh** followed by **Bring to Loading Bay**: Forklift weighs the goods and brings them to the loading bay.
10. **Load to Vehicle** followed by **Place in Stock**: Forklift loads goods onto the vehicle and then places them in stock.
11. **Place in Stock** followed by **Place in Stock**: Forklift places goods in stock multiple times.
12. **Place in Stock** followed by **Load to Vehicle**: Forklift places goods in stock and then loads them onto the vehicle.
13. **Load to Vehicle** followed by **Load to Vehicle**: Forklift loads goods onto the vehicle multiple times.
