**1. Identification of Cases with Long Durations:**

- **Case 2003**: Completed in **~48.5 hours** (April 1, 9:10 to April 3, 9:30).  
- **Case 2005**: Completed in **~77 hours** (April 1, 9:25 to April 4, 14:30).  
- **Case 2002**: Completed in **~25.9 hours** (April 1, 9:05 to April 2, 11:00).  

**Cases 2003 and 2005 are outliers**, taking significantly longer than others (e.g., Cases 2001 and 2004 took <2 hours).

**2. Root Cause Analysis via Attributes:**

**a. Complexity**  
- **High Complexity**: Cases 2003 and 2005 (both High) required **multiple "Request Additional Documents"** (2 and 3 times, respectively). Each request introduced delays (e.g., 6 hours between requests in Case 2003, and multi-day gaps in Case 2005).  
- **Medium/Low Complexity**: Fewer or no document requests (e.g., Case 2002 had 1 request, Cases 2001/2004 had none).  

**b. Resource**  
- **Manager_Bill**: Approved both slow cases (2003 and 2005). His approvals occurred **~24 hours after the last document request**, compared to Manager_Ann’s same-day approvals (e.g., Case 2002: approval 20 hours after request).  
- **Adjuster_Lisa** (Case 2005): Submitted 3 document requests over 3 days without escalation, suggesting inefficiency in follow-up.  

**c. Region**  
- **Region A (Case 2003)**: High complexity led to delays despite efficient Region A handling of low-complexity claims (Case 2001).  
- **Region B (Case 2005)**: High complexity combined with Manager_Bill and Adjuster_Lisa caused extreme delays.

**3. Explanations and Mitigation Strategies:**

**Root Causes**:  
- **High Complexity Claims**: Require iterative document requests, increasing cycle time.  
- **Manager_Bill’s Delayed Approvals**: Likely due to workload, stricter scrutiny, or inefficiency.  
- **Adjuster_Lisa’s Repeated Requests**: May indicate poor communication with claimants or lack of prioritization.  

**Mitigation Suggestions**:  
1. **Preemptive Document Checklists**: For high-complexity claims, predefine required documents to reduce back-and-forth.  
2. **Resource Rebalancing**:  
   - Train Manager_Ann to handle high-complexity approvals to reduce reliance on Manager_Bill.  
   - Assign specialized adjusters to high-complexity cases for faster resolution.  
3. **SLAs for Document Follow-ups**: Enforce deadlines for claimants (e.g., 24-hour reminders) and adjusters (e.g., escalate unresolved requests after 12 hours).  
4. **Monitor Manager Workloads**: Track approval times and redistribute cases if bottlenecks emerge.  

**Outcome**: Addressing these factors could reduce case durations by 30–50%, particularly for high-complexity claims.
