**1. Specific Invalid Trace:**  
`Receive_Order  Check_Inventory  Cancel_Order  Close_Order  Close_Order`

**2. Explanation:**  
The process tree model erroneously appends an additional `Close_Order` activity after the XOR node in the root sequence. When the cancellation path is taken (via the `Cancel_Order` branch), the model executes `Close_Order` twice:  
- First, as part of the `cancel_subtree` (which includes `Cancel_Order  Close_Order`),  
- Second, as part of the root sequence (`[receive_order, check_inventory, xor_node, **close_order**]`).  

**Domain Violation:**  
In a valid Order-to-Cash process, `Close_Order` should occur **exactly once** per order, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or canceled. Closing an order twice is nonsensical and could lead to inconsistencies in downstream systems (e.g., financial reconciliation, inventory updates, or customer notifications). The model’s structure allows this duplication, violating the domain’s requirement for idempotent closure of orders.  

**Additional Invalid Traces (for completeness):**  
The model also allows illogical sequences in the successful path due to the `PARALLEL` operator. For example:  
- `Receive_Order  Check_Inventory  Ship_Order  Authorize_Payment  Package_Items  Close_Order`  
This violates the domain rule that payment must be authorized **before** shipping, and items must be packaged **before** shipping.
