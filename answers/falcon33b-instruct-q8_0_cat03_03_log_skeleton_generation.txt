To construct the Log Skeleton, we need to define the constraints based on the provided scenarios and rules. Here's a possible Log Skeleton representation for the order fulfillment process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    'always_before': set(),
    'always_after': set(),
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {'Receive Order': {1}, 'Check Availability': {1}, 'Reserve Items': {1}, 'Pick Items': {1}, 'Quality Check': {1}, 'Pack Order': {1}, 'Generate Shipping Label': {1}, 'Dispatch': {1}, 'Invoice Customer': {1}, 'Record Payment': {1}},
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'), 
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'), 
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'), 
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'), 
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'), 
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'), 
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'), 
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'), 
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Equivalence**: No explicit equivalence constraints are provided, so the set is left empty.
2. **Always Before**: The process flows strictly from one activity to the next: `Receive Order`  `Check Availability`  `Reserve Items`  `Pick Items`  `Quality Check`  `Pack Order`  `Generate Shipping Label`  `Dispatch`  `Invoice Customer`  `Record Payment`.
3. **Always After**: No specific immediate follow-up activities are mentioned, hence the set is empty.
4. **Never Together**: No activities are explicitly stated as not to co-exist in the same case, so the set is empty.
5. **Activity Occurrences**: Each activity can only occur once, hence each has a frequency of 1: `{'Receive Order': {1}, 'Check Availability': {1}, ...}` (similarly for other activities).
6. **Directly-Follows Constraints**: The sequence is explicitly defined where each subsequent activity follows immediately after the previous one.

This Log Skeleton captures the linear progression of the order fulfillment process without implying any overlaps, dependencies outside this sequence, or bounds on occurrences beyond once for each activity. Adjustments may be necessary based on specific business rules or additional constraints not covered in this basic representation.
