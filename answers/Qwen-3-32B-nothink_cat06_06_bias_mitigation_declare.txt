## Explanation of Bias-Mitigation Constraints

1. **Responded Existence for Decisions:**
   - Ensures that whenever an "Approve" or "Reject" decision is made, a "ManualReview" activity must also exist in the trace.
   - This prevents automated decisions without human oversight, especially for sensitive cases.

2. **Coexistence for Decisions:**
   - Requires that "ManualReview" must coexist with both "Approve" and "Reject" decisions.
   - This ensures that all decisions have been subject to additional scrutiny.

3. **Response Constraints for Sensitive Attributes:**
   - After checking any sensitive attribute (race, gender, age), a "BiasMitigationCheck" activity must follow.
   - This introduces a mandatory step that should neutralize any potential bias from sensitive information.

4. **Succession to Final Decision:**
   - Only activities that have undergone a "BiasMitigationCheck" can lead to a "FinalDecision".
   - This ensures that all decisions are made after mitigating potential biases.

5. **Non-Coexistence of Sensitive Attributes and Final Decision:**
   - Prevents a "FinalDecision" from directly following any activity that checks sensitive attributes.
   - This ensures there's a necessary buffer (like a mitigation check) between sensitive information and final decisions.

6. **Non-Succession from Sensitive Attributes to Reject:**
   - Prevents a direct succession from any sensitive attribute check to a "Reject" decision.
   - This blocks the possibility of immediate biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes.

These constraints work together to create a process that:
- Requires additional checks for all final decisions
- Ensures human oversight for all critical decisions
- Introduces mandatory bias-mitigation steps after reviewing sensitive attributes
- Prevents direct paths from sensitive information to final decisions

This helps ensure that the loan application process is fair and consistent across all applicants, regardless of sensitive attributes.
