Looking at the data, the clear outliers are cases 2003 and 2005, both of which are marked as high complexity and take several days to close, compared to the low- and medium-complexity cases that finish within a single day.

The high-complexity claims follow a pattern: after the initial evaluation, multiple requests for additional documents are made, each separated by significant delays. In case 2003, there are two such requests with a full day in between, and in case 2005, there are three, stretching the timeline to four days. This repeated back-and-forth appears to be the primary driver of the extended durations.

Region doesn't seem to be a factor here—both long cases are in region A and region B, respectively, and the faster cases span both regions as well. Resource assignment also doesn't show a consistent pattern of delay; for example, Adjuster_Lisa handles both a fast low-complexity case and a slow high-complexity one.

That leaves complexity level as the strongest signal: high-complexity claims are the only ones requiring multiple rounds of additional documentation, and those rounds are spaced far enough apart to significantly extend the overall case duration. This suggests that the evaluation process for high-complexity claims may lack clear guidance on what documentation is needed upfront, or that the information requests themselves are not being fulfilled quickly enough.

Mitigation could focus on tightening the initial information-gathering phase for high-complexity claims, providing adjusters with more structured checklists, and setting internal service-level expectations for responding to documentation requests so that delays between rounds are minimized.
