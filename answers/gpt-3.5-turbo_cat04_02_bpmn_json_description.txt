The underlying process is a medical procedure related to ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization. The process includes various tasks such as preparing for the procedure, hand washing, getting in sterile clothes, cleaning and draping the puncture area, configuring the ultrasound, applying gel to the probe, covering the probe, putting sterile gel, positioning the probe and patient, identifying Doppler, anatomical and compression views, anesthetizing, performing the puncture, checking wire position in long and short axis, identifying wire in a good position, widening the pathway, advancing the catheter, removing the guidewire, checking flow and reflow, checking catheter position, and finally, removing the trocar. The process ends with checking the flow and proper positioning of the catheter before completing the procedure. The model also includes exclusive gateways for decision points in the process flow.
