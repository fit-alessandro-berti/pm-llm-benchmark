Here's a Python dictionary representing an estimated temporal profile for the given global supply chain process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (1209600, 86400),  # Supplier Selection to Order Placement (Average: ~3.34 months, SD: ~1 month)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (7200, 1800),     # Order Placement to Receive Components (Average: ~2 hours, SD: ~0.5 hours)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 10800),   # Receive Components to Quality Inspection (Average: ~12 hours, SD: ~3 hours)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (10800, 3600),    # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly (Average: ~3 hours, SD: ~1 hour)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (7200, 2520),     # Component Assembly to Product Testing (Average: ~2 hours, SD: ~48 minutes)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (900, 180),       # Product Testing to Packaging (Average: ~15 minutes, SD: ~3 minutes)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 1800),     # Packaging to Warehouse Storage (Average: ~2 hours, SD: ~0.5 hours)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (43200, 10800),   # Warehouse Storage to Distribution (Average: ~12 hours, SD: ~3 hours)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (172800, 54000)   # Distribution to After-Sales Support (Average: ~4.79 days, SD: ~15.56 days)
}
```

This temporal profile considers the average and standard deviation times for activity pairs that may be separated by multiple steps in the supply chain process. For instance, 'Supplier Selection' to 'After-Sales Support' could involve several intermediate steps and their respective delays.
