### Rationale for Added Constraints

1. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that manual review and bias mitigation checks are part of the process to enforce fairness.
   - **Explanation:** These activities are essential for ensuring that decisions involving sensitive applicants are thoroughly reviewed and that any potential biases are addressed.

2. **Coexistence of `ManualReview` with `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`:**
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that any decision involving minority applicants is accompanied by a manual review.
   - **Explanation:** This constraint helps to ensure that decisions are not made in a discriminatory manner and that there is a human oversight to prevent biased outcomes.

3. **Response from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that a bias mitigation check is performed after checking the applicant's race.
   - **Explanation:** This constraint ensures that any potential biases introduced by the applicant's race are addressed before making a decision.

4. **Succession of `BiasMitigationCheck` to `Approve` and `Reject`:**
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that a bias mitigation check must occur before a final decision (approve or reject) is made.
   - **Explanation:** This constraint helps to ensure that decisions are made only after a thorough review and that any biases are mitigated.

5. **Non-succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Approve` and `Reject`:**
   - **Purpose:** Prevent a direct succession from checking the applicant's race to making a final decision.
   - **Explanation:** This constraint ensures that a bias mitigation check or other necessary steps are taken before making a decision, reducing the risk of immediate biased outcomes.

6. **Non-chainsuccession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Approve` and `Reject`:**
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that there is no direct chain of events from checking the applicant's race to making a final decision.
   - **Explanation:** This constraint reinforces the need for a bias mitigation check or other steps to break the direct link between the applicant's race and the decision, further reducing the risk of biased outcomes.

By adding these constraints, the process is designed to be more fair and consistent, ensuring that decisions involving sensitive applicants are thoroughly reviewed and that potential biases are addressed.
