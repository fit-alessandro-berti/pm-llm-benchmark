Okay, let's see how I can approach this problem step by step. The goal is to write a DuckDB SQL query that does several things: first, determine the sequence of activities for each case_id ordered by timestamp; then group these sequences into variants, count them, find the top K ones, and finally return all events from those top variant cases.

Starting with part 1: constructing the activity sequence per case. For each case_id, I need to order their activities by timestamp and concatenate them into a string representing the process variant. That sounds like using GROUP_CONCAT or something similar, but DuckDB might have specific functions. Oh right, DuckDB supports array_agg which can aggregate ordered values into an array. Wait, maybe it's better to use STRING_AGG with ordering. Let me check: yes, in SQL you can do ORDER BY within the aggregation function if using a window function or subquery.

So for each case_id, I need to get all activities sorted by timestamp and then combine them into a single string. For example, activity A followed by B followed by C would become 'A,B,C' as the variant identifier.

Then part 2 is grouping cases by their complete activity sequence (the concatenated string) and count how many cases each variant has. So after creating the variant strings for each case_id, I need to group by that string and sum the number of case_ids per group.

Next step is determining the top K variants based on frequency. But since SQL doesn't have a direct TOP K without specifying K, but here in the problem statement they mention "top K", so probably we'll need a parameter or maybe use LIMIT after ordering by count descending. Wait, actually, part 3 says to determine the top K variants and then return events from those cases. So perhaps first create a list of variant strings that are in the top K based on their counts, and then filter all case_ids that belong to these variants.

But how do we get only the top K variants? For example, for each variant (activity sequence), count the number of case_ids under it, order by this count descending, take the first K rows, collect their activity sequences, and then find all case_ids in those sequences. Then join back to the original event_log to return events from these cases.

Putting this into SQL code:

First step: for each case_id, determine the ordered activities as a variant string.

We can do that with a CTE (common table expression):

WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)

Then, count the variants:

variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    variant,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
),

Next, select the top K variants. Let's assume K is a parameter here; in DuckDB you can use a placeholder variable or perhaps use LIMIT. But since we need to join back later, maybe get the list of top variants as those with the highest counts.

top_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY cnt DESC
  LIMIT K
)

But wait, how do you handle ties? For example, if two variants have the same count and are at position K. Depending on whether we want to include all of them or just exactly top K regardless, but standard LIMIT would cut off after K rows.

Once I have the top_variants list, then get all case_ids that belong to these variants:

selected_cases AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM case_variants
  WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variats)
)

Finally, select all events from event_log where case_id is in selected_cases.

So putting it together:

WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    variant,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
top_variats AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY cnt DESC
  LIMIT K -- assuming K is a parameter here; in DuckDB you can use a variable substitution like ? or specify it as a number.
),
selected_cases AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM case_variants
  WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variats)
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM selected_cases);

Wait, but does STRING_AGG with ordering by timestamp work in DuckDB? Let me check the documentation. Yes, DuckDB's STRING_AGG function allows an ORDER BY clause within the aggregation: STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp).

Also, need to make sure that the case_variants CTE groups each case_id into their activity sequence correctly.

Another consideration: when K is a parameter, how to pass it. But in the problem statement, they don't specify K as part of the prompt's input; likely, we can hardcode K (e.g., top 5) or use a placeholder variable. Since SQL doesn't have variables unless using prepared statements, but for simplicity here perhaps replace LIMIT K with a specific number.

But since the problem says "top K variants by their frequency", and assuming that K is given as part of the query parameters, in DuckDB you can parameterize it via PREPARE statements or use ?. But in this case, writing the SQL generically would require replacing K with an integer value. So for example, if we want top 3, LIMIT 3.

Putting all together:

WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    variant,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
top_variats AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY cnt DESC
  LIMIT 3 -- replace with K value here; in DuckDB, perhaps using a parameter.
),
selected_cases AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM case_variants
  WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variats)
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM selected_cases);

This should work. Let me verify the steps:

1. For each case, aggregate activities into a string ordered by timestamp to get their process variant.
2. Count how many cases fall under each variant.
3. Select top K variants based on those counts.
4. Get all case_ids that are in these top variants.
5. Return all events from event_log where the case_id is among those selected.

Yes, this should do it. The main parts are using STRING_AGG with ORDER BY to get the variant string correctly ordered by timestamp for each case, then grouping and counting, selecting the top ones, joining back to find their cases, and returning all events from these cases.
</think>

Here is a DuckDB SQL query that fulfills the requirements:

```sql
WITH 
case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY cnt DESC
    LIMIT 3 -- Replace 3 with desired K value
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM case_variants cv 
    WHERE cv.case_id = e.case_id AND cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **case_variants CTE**:  
   - Groups events by `case_id`.
   - Uses `STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp)` to create a string representing the ordered sequence of activities for each case.

2. **variant_counts CTE**:  
   - Groups the results from `case_variants` by the generated variant strings.
   - Counts how many cases correspond to each variant.

3. **top_variants CTE**:  
   - Selects the top K variants based on their frequency (using `LIMIT K`, replace 3 with your desired K value).

4. **Final SELECT**:  
   - Uses an `EXISTS` clause to filter events from the original log that belong only to cases in the top K variants.
   - Ensures efficiency by correlating each event's `case_id` with those in the top variants.

**Note:** Replace `LIMIT 3` with your desired value for K. DuckDB allows parameterized queries, so you can adjust this dynamically if needed.
