The picture is a workflow/processmodel diagram (in a heuristic/Petrinet style).  
Rounded rectangles are activities labeled with letters and names:

- **a** – “register request” (start)  
- **b** – “examine thoroughly”  
- **c** – “examine casually”  
- **d** – “check ticket”  
- **e** – “decide”  
- **f** – “reinitiate request” (loops back to the examination/check steps)  
- **g** – “pay compensation”  
- **h** – “reject request”  
- **z** – “end”

Arrows show the flow from left to right: after registering, the request is examined (thoroughly or casually) and/or the ticket is checked, then a decision is made; the process then either pays compensation or rejects the request, both leading to the end. A loop via **f** allows reinitiating the request and repeating the checks.

Small black dots act as split/join connectors indicating different controlflow logic.  
The gray inset at the bottom right is a legend showing how **XOR**, **AND**, and **OR** splits and joins are drawn.
