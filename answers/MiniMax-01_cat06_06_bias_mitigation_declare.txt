### **Rationale for Added Constraints**

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that any decision involving sensitive attributes (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Female`) is always accompanied by a `ManualReview`. This adds a layer of scrutiny to decisions that may be susceptible to bias.
   - **Implementation:** Added `ManualReview` as a coexisting activity with each sensitive decision category.

2. **Response and Precedence Constraints:**
   - **Purpose:** Mandate that a `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede any decision (`Approve` or `Reject`) following the disclosure of sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`). This ensures that potential biases are actively addressed before a decision is made.
   - **Implementation:** 
     - Added `BiasMitigationCheck` as a response to sensitive attribute checks.
     - Enforced precedence of `BiasMitigationCheck` before decisions.

3. **Succession and Non-succession Constraints:**
   - **Purpose:** Prohibit direct succession from a sensitive attribute disclosure to a decision (`Approve` or `Reject`). This prevents immediate, potentially biased decisions based on sensitive information without proper mitigation.
   - **Implementation:** 
     - Set the support for direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` and `CheckApplicantGender` to `Approve` and `Reject` to `0.0`, effectively banning such sequences.
     - Added non-succession constraints to reinforce the ban on direct succession.

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - **Sensitive Attributes:** The constraints consider multiple sensitive attributes (`ApplicantRace`, `ApplicantGender`) and their combinations (e.g., `Minority_Female`) to ensure comprehensive bias mitigation.
   - **Support and Confidence:** All new constraints are assigned a `support` of `1.0` and a `confidence` of `1.0` to enforce strict adherence within the process.

By incorporating these constraints, the loan application process is safeguarded against biased decision-making, promoting fairness and consistency, especially for applicants from sensitive demographics.
