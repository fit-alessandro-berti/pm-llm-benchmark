Here’s a clear walk-through of the business process embodied in the pseudo-BPMN, explaining the purpose of each step, what the gateways mean, how paths diverge, converge, and loop, and how the process differs for standard vs. custom requests.

1) Start Event
Purpose: Marks the initiation of the process when a customer request is received.

2) Task A: Receive Customer Request
Purpose: Capture and register the incoming request, gather essential details (customer info, product/service requested, quantity, timelines, customization needs).
Outcome: A structured case or ticket with sufficient data to triage.

3) Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type
Meaning: An exclusive decision point that routes the request down exactly one of two mutually exclusive paths based on request type.
Branches:
- Standard path: For off-the-shelf or predefined offerings.
- Custom path: For tailored or non-standard requirements.

STANDARD PATH

4) Task B1: Perform Standard Validation
Purpose: Confirm the request is complete and valid for standard processing (e.g., verify product code, quantity, customer eligibility, pricing rules). Ensures data integrity before deeper checks.

5) Gateway (AND): Run Parallel Checks
Meaning: A parallel split. Both checks run concurrently to reduce cycle time.
Parallel tasks:
- Task C1: Credit Check
  Purpose: Assess the customer’s creditworthiness, limits, outstanding balances, and payment terms.
- Task C2: Inventory Check
  Purpose: Confirm current stock availability or lead times for replenishment.

6) All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)
Meaning: A parallel join that waits for both credit and inventory checks to finish. The process cannot continue until both outcomes are known.
Outcome: Synchronized results for credit and inventory.

7) Task D: Calculate Delivery Date
Purpose: Based on inventory status, lead times, logistics constraints, and possibly credit terms, the system computes a realistic delivery date or fulfillment schedule for the standard order.

CUSTOM PATH

8) Task B2: Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis
Purpose: Determine whether the requested customization is technically and economically viable. May involve engineering review, supplier capability checks, special materials lead times, and cost estimations.

9) Gateway (XOR): Is Customization Feasible?
Meaning: Exclusive decision based on feasibility outcome.
Branches:
- If Yes: Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation
  Purpose: Create a tailored proposal including scope, price, delivery timeline, and terms for the custom solution.
- If No: Task E2: Send Rejection Notice
  Purpose: Communicate that the requested customization cannot be delivered. Process ends for this request.
  End Event: The process terminates upon sending the rejection.

COMMON POST-PATH DECISIONS

10) After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed
The process converges here from either:
- Standard path after Task D (delivery date known), or
- Custom path after Task E1 (custom quotation prepared).

11) Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Needed?
Meaning: An exclusive decision based on internal policy (e.g., price thresholds, margin levels, credit risk, discounts, exception handling).
Branches:
- If Yes: Task F: Obtain Manager Approval
  Purpose: Seek authorization from a manager or approver due to exceptional pricing, low margins, high order value, special terms, or risk.
  Next: Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Granted?
    - If Yes: Task G: Generate Final Invoice
      Purpose: Formalize the sale by creating the final invoice reflecting agreed terms/prices.
    - If No: Task H: Re-evaluate Conditions
      Purpose: Address reasons for rejection (e.g., adjust price, terms, delivery, scope).
      Loop-back behavior:
      - For Custom path: Return to Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation) to revise the offer.
      - For Standard path: Return to Task D (Calculate Delivery Date) or more generally rework standard parameters (e.g., delivery commitments, pricing under standard rules). The diagram states loop to Task D explicitly for Standard.
  Notes on the loop: This is an iterative cycle until approval is granted or the request is withdrawn/canceled out-of-band.
- If No Approval Needed: Task G: Generate Final Invoice
  Purpose: Proceed directly to invoicing when request is within policy and no escalation is required.

12) Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer
Purpose: Communicate the final terms to the customer (order confirmation, invoice details, delivery date or custom agreement). This may include instructions for payment or next steps.

13) End Event
Purpose: Marks the conclusion of the process once confirmation is sent.

Key differences: Standard vs. Custom

- Standard:
  - Validation focuses on correctness and policy compliance for predefined products/services.
  - Parallel checks for credit and inventory ensure feasibility without custom engineering.
  - Delivery date calculation is central to setting realistic expectations.
  - Approval may be needed for exceptions (e.g., unusual discounts, credit risk), which can trigger rework at Task D (e.g., adjust delivery date/terms).

- Custom:
  - Core step is feasibility analysis to assess technical and cost viability.
  - If feasible, a custom quotation (Task E1) is prepared; if not feasible, the process ends with a rejection notice (Task E2).
  - Approval may be required due to higher risk, bespoke pricing, or non-standard terms. If rejected, rework loops back to revise the custom quotation (Task E1).

Gateway semantics and convergence

- XOR (exclusive) gateways:
  - Check Request Type: Routes to Standard or Custom exclusively.
  - Is Customization Feasible?: Routes to Prepare Quotation or Rejection exclusively.
  - Is Approval Needed?: Routes to Approval or Final Invoice exclusively.
  - Is Approval Granted?: Routes to Final Invoice or Rework exclusively.

- AND (parallel) gateway:
  - Run Parallel Checks: Splits work into simultaneous Credit Check and Inventory Check to reduce overall cycle time.
  - Join waits for both checks to complete before continuing.

Loop-back logic and rework triggers

- Trigger conditions for approval:
  - High order value, low margin, exceptional discounts, extended payment terms, elevated credit risk, or policy exceptions.
- If approval denied:
  - Custom path rework: Return to Task E1 to adjust the quotation (scope, price, terms, lead times).
  - Standard path rework: Return to Task D to adjust delivery or other standard parameters as allowed.
- The loop continues until approval is granted or the request is abandoned outside this flow.

Overall flow summary

- Intake and classification (Standard vs. Custom).
- Standard: Validate, run parallel credit/inventory checks, compute delivery date.
- Custom: Feasibility analysis, either prepare quotation or reject.
- Approval decision: Either obtain approval (with potential rework) or proceed directly.
- Finalize invoice and send confirmation.
- Process ends.

This structure ensures efficient handling of straightforward orders, rigorous evaluation of custom requests, control via approvals for risk or exceptions, and a clear rework path when conditions are not initially acceptable.
