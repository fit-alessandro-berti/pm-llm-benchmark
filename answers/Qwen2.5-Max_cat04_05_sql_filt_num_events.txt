To solve this problem, we need to filter out cases (`case_id`) that have more than six events and return only the events from cases with six or fewer events. This involves two main steps:

1. **Count the number of events per `case_id`**: Use an aggregate function (`COUNT`) grouped by `case_id` to determine the number of events for each case.
2. **Filter cases based on the event count**: Exclude cases where the event count exceeds six and return all events for the remaining cases.

Here is the DuckDB SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
WITH case_event_count AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    case_event_count c
ON
    e.case_id = c.case_id
WHERE
    c.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Step 1: Count Events Per Case**
   - The `WITH case_event_count` Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the number of events for each `case_id` using `COUNT(*)` and groups the data by `case_id`.
   - The result of this CTE is a table with two columns: `case_id` and `event_count`.

2. **Step 2: Filter Cases Based on Event Count**
   - The main query joins the original `event_log` table with the `case_event_count` CTE on the `case_id` column.
   - A `WHERE` clause is applied to include only those cases where `event_count` is less than or equal to six.

3. **Step 3: Return Full Event Details**
   - The `SELECT e.*` statement retrieves all columns from the `event_log` table for the filtered cases.

### Key Considerations:
- **Efficiency**: The use of a CTE ensures that the event count calculation is performed once and reused in the filtering step.
- **Correctness**: By joining the original table with the filtered case counts, we ensure that only events from valid cases are returned.
- **Scalability**: This approach works efficiently even for large datasets, as DuckDB is optimized for analytical queries involving aggregations and joins.

This query adheres to the requirements and ensures that only events from cases with six or fewer events are included in the final result.
