Here’s the updated `declare_model` with bias-mitigating constraints added, along with explanations for each addition:

### Updated `declare_model`:
```python

### Rationale for Added Constraints:
1. **`existence` of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - Ensures these activities are present in traces where sensitive attributes are involved, forcing accountability.

2. **`responded_existence` for sensitive attribute checks:**
   - If `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, or `CheckApplicantAge` occurs, `ManualReview` must exist in the trace. This ensures sensitive attributes trigger additional scrutiny.

3. **`coexistence` for decisions involving sensitive groups:**
   - Decisions like `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Female` must coexist with `ManualReview`, ensuring no decision is made without oversight for sensitive groups.

4. **`response` and `chainresponse` for sensitive attribute checks:**
   - Sensitive attribute checks (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) must be followed by `BiasMitigationCheck` (either eventually or immediately). This prevents decisions from being made directly after sensitive attribute disclosure.

5. **`precedence` and `succession` for `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - `FinalDecision` must be preceded by `BiasMitigationCheck`, and `BiasMitigationCheck` must be succeeded by `FinalDecision`. This enforces a mandatory fairness check before any decision.

6. **`nonsuccession` and `nonchainsuccession`:**
   - Prevents direct or immediate succession from sensitive attribute checks (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to `Reject`, reducing the risk of biased snap decisions.

### How These Constraints Reduce Bias:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Sensitive attribute checks cannot directly influence decisions without intermediate steps (`BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`).
- **Mandatory Oversight:** Decisions for sensitive groups always require `ManualReview`, reducing the likelihood of unfair outcomes.
- **Temporal Separation:** `nonsuccession` and `nonchainsuccession` constraints prevent immediate rejection after sensitive attribute disclosure, forcing deliberation.
- **Consistency:** `coexistence` and `responded_existence` ensure fairness checks are not skipped for sensitive cases.

This model enforces procedural fairness while preserving the original process structure.
