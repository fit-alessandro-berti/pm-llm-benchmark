### Anomalies Identified

1. **Inconsistent Assignment of Activities:**
   - The model indicates that a claim can be evaluated before it is assigned to an adjuster (rule `E -> A`), but there's no corresponding rule for assigning resources during the evaluation phase.

2. **Conflicting Precedence and Existence Rules:**
   - Rule 3 states that closing claims should come after evaluating them (`C -> E`), yet Rule 4 suggests that evaluations are prerequisites for closing (`E -> C`). These rules contradict each other in terms of sequence.

### Hypotheses

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Requirements:**
   - The model might have been created based on incomplete or inaccurate representations of the actual insurance claim process, leading to inconsistencies in its constraints.

2. **Incremental Changes in Policies:**
   - There may be new policies that were introduced after initially developing the DECLARE model but were not uniformly reflected throughout all rules and constraints.

3. **Technical Issues or Data Inconsistencies:**
   - There might have been issues with data collection, integration, or processing, causing partial or inaccurate application of constraints in the DECLARE model.

4. **Pressure to Handle Claims Quickly:**
   - To process claims more efficiently, adjustments were made that allowed bypassing essential steps, leading to inconsistencies in the DECLARE model’s rules.

### Verification Approaches

1. **Identify Closed Claims Without Evaluation (rule `E -> C` conflict):**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id FROM claims 
   WHERE status = 'closed' AND evaluation IS NULL;
   ```

2. **Trace Claims with Both Evaluation and Closing Activities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT cl.claim_id, a.adjuster_id, ae.activity, ae.timestamp 
   FROM claims cl 
   JOIN adjusters a ON cl.customer_id = a.customer_id
   JOIN claim_events ae ON cl.claim_id = ae.claim_id AND ae.activity IN ('E', 'C');
   ```

3. **Find Adjusters Not Assigned Before Evaluation (rule `A -> E` conflict):**
   ```sql
   SELECT cl.claim_id, ad.adjuster_id 
   FROM adjusters ad 
   WHERE ad.specialization = 'home' OR ad.specialization = 'auto'
   JOIN claims cl ON cl.customer_id = ad.customer_id
   LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON cl.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A';
   ```

4. **Check for Claims Closed Without Assigning an Adjuster (rule `C -> E` conflict):**
   ```sql
   SELECT cl.claim_id, a.adjuster_id 
   FROM claims cl
   JOIN adjusters ad ON cl.customer_id = ad.customer_id
   WHERE cl.status = 'closed' AND ad.adjuster_id IS NULL;
   ```

By running these SQL queries, we can validate the anomalies and gain insights into why certain rules are contradictory or anomalous in practice.
