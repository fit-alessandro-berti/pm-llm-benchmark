Here’s a structured list of open-ended questions designed to deepen understanding of the property onboarding process, organized by focus area:

### **Process Gaps and Documentation**  
1. How do you handle situations where a landlord cannot provide required documents (e.g., outdated inspection reports) due to financial or logistical constraints? Are there alternative pathways to proceed?  
2. Beyond deeds and compliance certificates, are there other documents or approvals required for properties in specific jurisdictions (e.g., historic districts, rent-controlled areas)?  

### **Decision Criteria for Assigning Property Managers**  
3. How is a manager’s "track record" quantified or evaluated when assigning them to landlords with unique requirements (e.g., luxury units)? Are there formal performance metrics?  
4. What happens if no manager with relevant experience (e.g., student housing) is available in a region? How is expertise balanced against workload?  

### **Roles, Responsibilities, and Handoffs**  
5. Who oversees the handoff from the property coordinator to the property manager, and how is consistency ensured in communicating the landlord’s expectations?  
6. During tenant screening, how are responsibilities divided between the property manager and leasing agent? Who has final authority to approve a tenant?  

### **Exception Management**  
7. Can you walk through how a property requiring special insurance (e.g., flood zones) is flagged and addressed? Who collaborates with the landlord in these cases?  
8. How are custom lease clauses requested by landlords reviewed for legal or compliance risks? Is there a cross-functional team involved?  

### **Timing, Sequencing, and Dependencies**  
9. Are any steps in the process executed in parallel (e.g., scheduling photography while awaiting inspection results), or is the process strictly sequential?  
10. What typically causes delays between property activation and tenant move-in, and how are these mitigated?  

### **Quality Assurance and Compliance**  
11. If a compliance officer identifies a discrepancy in the lease after activation, what steps are taken to rectify it? Does this trigger a broader audit?  
12. How does the financial analyst reconcile deviations from the company’s pricing strategy (e.g., a landlord insisting on below-market rent)?  

### **Stakeholder Communication and Tools**  
13. How are conflicts between landlords and inspectors resolved (e.g., disputed repair requirements)? Is there an escalation protocol?  
14. How does the CRM system ensure critical details (e.g., pet policies) aren’t lost between regional offices, managers, and support teams?  

### **Market and Operational Adaptability**  
15. How does the digital marketing team incorporate "current market trends" into pricing models? Are there regional variations in this analysis?  
16. What happens if a property fails to attract tenants after activation? Is there a process to revisit pricing, marketing, or inspection outcomes?  

### **Training and Contingencies**  
17. Are property managers trained to handle niche requirements (e.g., furnished rentals), or is expertise gained solely through experience?  
18. If a property manager leaves mid-onboarding, how is continuity maintained with the landlord and tenants?  

### **Outcome Measurement**  
19. How is the success of the onboarding process measured? Are there metrics for landlord satisfaction, time-to-lease, or post-move-in issues?  

These questions aim to uncover tacit knowledge, decision-making frameworks, and potential pain points while avoiding technical implementation details. They encourage the interviewee to reflect on nuances, exceptions, and interdependencies within the process.
