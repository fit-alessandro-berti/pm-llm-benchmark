To reconstruct the **case groupings** (i.e., identify which events belong to the same patient journey), we need to analyze the data using the following clues:

- **Patient demographics** (`patient_age`, `patient_gender`) are strong indicators — if two events have the same age and gender, they **might** belong to the same patient.
- **Department flow** — certain departments are only involved in specific types of care (e.g., Surgery vs. ER).
- **Activity sequences** — typical process flows (e.g., register  triage  consult  test  discharge).
- **Timestamps** — events in a single case should be **temporally consistent**, with logical order and proximity.
- **Resource patterns** — sometimes the same doctor might follow a patient, but this is less reliable.
- **Additional info** — unique details like `body_part`, `reason`, or `procedure` can help distinguish cases.

### Step 1: Extract Unique Patient Profiles

We look at combinations of `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `department` to identify potential distinct patients.

| Age | Gender | Department | Count |
|-----|--------|------------|-------|
| 45  | M      | ER         | ?     |
| 62  | F      | ER         | ?     |
| 28  | M      | Surgery    | ?     |

Each combination is **unique**, suggesting **three distinct patients**.

So we expect **3 cases**.

Let’s group events by `(patient_age, patient_gender)`:

---

### **Candidate Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER Patient)**

Events:
- 1. `Register patient` (ER) – 08:05:13
- 4. `Initial triage` (ER) – 08:10:50
- 7. `X-ray imaging` (Radiology) – 08:15:42
- 12. `Doctor consultation` (ER) – 08:23:10
- 15. `Patient discharged` (ER) – 08:30:05

**Flow analysis:**
- Registration  Triage  X-ray  Doctor consult  Discharge
- Logical ER path for injury (X-ray on left leg  diagnosis of hairline fracture)
- Timestamps are increasing and sequential.
- All activities consistent with ER trauma path.

 **Coherent case**

---

### **Candidate Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER Patient)**

Events:
- 2. `Register patient` (ER) – 08:07:02
- 5. `Initial triage` (ER) – 08:12:29
- 8. `Lab test requested` (ER) – 08:16:10
- 10. `Lab test completed` (Lab) – 08:20:27
- 11. `Doctor consultation` (ER) – 08:22:54
- 14. `Prescription created` (ER) – 08:27:00
- 17. `Patient discharged` (ER) – 08:35:29

**Flow analysis:**
- Registration  Triage (code 2 = higher priority)  Lab test requested  completed  Doctor consult  Prescription  Discharge
- Logical ER path for infection (blood panel, antibiotics prescribed)
- All timestamps in order.
- Department: ER and Lab (supporting role)

 **Coherent case**

---

### **Candidate Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Surgery Patient)**

Events:
- 3. `Register patient` (Surgery) – 08:07:15
- 6. `Doctor consultation` (Surgery) – 08:13:00
- 9. `Surgery preparation` (Surgery) – 08:16:45
- 13. `Surgery performed` (Surgery) – 08:25:19
- 16. `Recovery room` (Surgery) – 08:31:37
- 18. `Patient discharged` (Surgery) – 08:40:13

**Flow analysis:**
- Registration in Surgery (not ER)  Consultation (reason: scheduled knee surgery)  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge
- Entirely within surgical pathway.
- Timestamps sequential.
- No ER involvement — likely elective surgery.
- `body_part=left_leg` in another case, but this one has `procedure=arthroscopy` — likely same body area but different patient.

 **Coherent case**

---

### Check for Conflicts or Overlaps

- Is there any duplication of attributes across cases?
  - All three patients have **distinct age/gender**.
  - Different departments for registration (ER vs Surgery) — supports separation.
  - No shared timestamps or resource conflicts.
- Could event 7 (`X-ray imaging` for 45M) be related to surgery case? Unlikely:
  - The 28M had **scheduled** surgery — prep and procedure happen quickly after consult.
  - His process starts at 08:07:15, and surgery is at 08:25:19 — tight schedule, no imaging in between.
  - But the 45M has X-ray **after** triage and **before** consult — typical for trauma.
  - So X-ray belongs to ER trauma case (45M), not surgery.

Also, 28M’s surgery is **arthroscopy** — often preceded by imaging, but here it’s not recorded. Possibly done earlier (pre-admission), or omitted. But since no imaging event matches his timeline/demographics, we assume it's not in this log.

###  Conclusion: There are **3 distinct cases**, grouped as above.

Each case is uniquely identifiable by:
- **Patient age and gender**
- **Department-specific pathways**
- **Logical activity sequences**
- **Temporal consistency**

No evidence of more than 3 patients or mixed events.
