Bias is evident in the Group B (Unprotected Group) log due to the use of preferential score adjustments tied to LocalResident and CommunityGroup attributes, which are not available to Group A (Protected Group).

What’s happening
- In Group B, applicants who are LocalResidents and members of a specific CommunityGroup (Highland Civic Darts Club) receive a +10 “Community Boost” in PreliminaryScoring that carries through ManualReview and FinalDecision.
- In Group A, there are no score adjustments at any stage. LocalResident is FALSE and CommunityGroup is None for all cases, and ScoreAdjustment is always 0.

How the bias manifests
- Systematic score uplift: Group B cases with CommunityGroup membership receive a +10 adjustment; Group A never receives any uplift, even for equivalent base scores.
- Impact on outcomes near the decision threshold:
  - P002 (Group A) with score 710 and no adjustment is rejected.
  - U002 (Group B) with the same base score 710 and no adjustment is also rejected, suggesting a threshold around >710.
  - P001 and U001 both start at 720; U001’s +10 boost lifts it to 730, but both are approved—here the uplift isn’t necessary but still preferential.
  - U003 starts at 695; the +10 boost to 705 helps it get approved, whereas an equivalent Group A applicant at 695 would likely be rejected (no such case shown, but implied by the threshold behavior around 710 and the lack of adjustments in Group A).

Role of attributes
- LocalResident: All Group B applicants are TRUE; all Group A are FALSE. This correlates perfectly with access to the CommunityGroup membership and the resulting boost, creating a pathway for favorable treatment unavailable to Group A.
- CommunityGroup: Membership in “Highland Civic Darts Club” triggers a consistent +10 adjustment in Group B; Group A has no community membership recorded and thus receives no boost.
- ScoreAdjustment: Present and positive only for Group B members of the community group; always 0 in Group A. This directly alters the effective score used in decisions.

Why this is problematic
- The adjustment is applied along a protected-group boundary (Group A never benefits), creating a disparate treatment mechanism.
- Because decisions appear threshold-based, even a modest +10 produces disparate outcomes, especially for borderline cases (e.g., turning 695 into 705 and securing approval).

Conclusion
The Group B log exhibits bias via a CommunityGroup-based score boost that is systematically unavailable to the Protected Group (Group A). Tying favorable ScoreAdjustments to LocalResident/CommunityGroup status yields systematic differences in final decisions and likely disparate impact against Group A.
