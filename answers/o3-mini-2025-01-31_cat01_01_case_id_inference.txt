We can determine the case groupings by noticing that each unique patient consistently appears with the same age, gender, and (mostly) department. In this log, three distinct patients are evident:

  
Case 1 – Patient 45, M  
  
• Event 1 – 08:05:13: "Register patient" in ER (45/M, insurance=private).  
• Event 4 – 08:10:50: "Initial triage" in ER (45/M, triage_code=3).  
• Event 7 – 08:15:42: "X-ray imaging" in Radiology (45/M, left_leg).  
• Event 12 – 08:23:10: "Doctor consultation" in ER (45/M, diagnosis=hairline_fracture).  
• Event 15 – 08:30:05: "Patient discharged" in ER (45/M, followup=outpatient_clinic).

  
Case 2 – Patient 62, F  
  
• Event 2 – 08:07:02: "Register patient" in ER (62/F, insurance=public).  
• Event 5 – 08:12:29: "Initial triage" in ER (62/F, triage_code=2).  
• Event 8 – 08:16:10: "Lab test requested" in ER (62/F, test_type=blood_panel).  
• Event 10 – 08:20:27: "Lab test completed" in Laboratory (62/F, results=normal_levels).  
• Event 11 – 08:22:54: "Doctor consultation" in ER (62/F, diagnosis=minor_infection).  
• Event 14 – 08:27:00: "Prescription created" in ER (62/F, medication=antibiotics).  
• Event 17 – 08:35:29: "Patient discharged" in ER (62/F, followup=pharmacy_pickup).

  
Case 3 – Patient 28, M  
  
• Event 3 – 08:07:15: "Register patient" in Surgery (28/M, insurance=private).  
• Event 6 – 08:13:00: "Doctor consultation" in Surgery (28/M, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery).  
• Event 9 – 08:16:45: "Surgery preparation" in Surgery (28/M, prep_type=general_anesthesia).  
• Event 13 – 08:25:19: "Surgery performed" in Surgery (28/M, procedure=arthroscopy).  
• Event 16 – 08:31:37: "Recovery room" (Recovery Nurse in Surgery, 28/M, condition=stable).  
• Event 18 – 08:40:13: "Patient discharged" in Surgery (28/M, followup=physiotherapy_sessions).

  
Explanation:

1. Although events from multiple departments are interleaved in time, the consistency in patient demographics (age and gender) helps us cluster the events.  
2. The order of activities (registration, triage/consultation, diagnostics/treatment, discharge) follows a logical patient journey.  
3. When an event’s department differs (e.g., the X-ray for Case 1 is in Radiology) it still belongs to the same patient journey because the patient’s age/gender match.

Thus, based on sequence and attributes, we have three distinct cases corresponding to the three patients.
