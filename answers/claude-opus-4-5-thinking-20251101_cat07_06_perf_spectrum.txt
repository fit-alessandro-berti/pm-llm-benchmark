# Visualization Description

This is a **dotted chart** or **event timeline visualization**, commonly used in process mining to display the temporal flow of events in a business process.

## Structure

The visualization shows three process activities arranged vertically:
1. **Send Fine** (top)
2. **Insert Fine Notification** (middle)
3. **Send for Credit Collection** (bottom)

## Time Range
The horizontal axis represents time, spanning from **January 2000** to **April 2013** (approximately 13 years of data).

## Visual Patterns

- **Gray lines (top section)**: Dense vertical lines representing "Send Fine" events, with diagonal connections flowing down to "Insert Fine Notification"

- **Pink/Red lines (bottom section)**: Connect "Insert Fine Notification" to "Send for Credit Collection," forming distinctive **fan/triangular patterns**

## Key Insights

1. **Continuous fine issuance**: Fines are sent relatively steadily throughout the time period

2. **Batch processing for credit collection**: The triangular fan patterns indicate that credit collection happens in **periodic batches**, where multiple cases are processed together at specific points in time

3. **Variable delays**: The spread of diagonal lines shows varying time gaps between fine notifications and credit collection actions

4. **Process flow**: This appears to represent a traffic fine or penalty enforcement workflow
