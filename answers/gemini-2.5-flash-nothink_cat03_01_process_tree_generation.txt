# The loop structure: * (tau, loop_body_seq)
# The prompt's loop definition is * (A, B) where A is executed, then either exit or execute B and then A again.
# This means A is the "loop entry" activity, and B is the "iteration body".
# In our case, the loop is entered if results are abnormal. The loop condition is implicit.
# We model this by having a silent step (tau) as the activity that "starts" the loop,
# and the loop_body_seq as the activity that is repeated until exit.
# This implies that the 'tau' is done once, then the loop body executes, then the tau again, etc.
# However, the common interpretation of a loop for process trees is 'initial_part' * ('loop_body_part').
# Since the abnormal result triggers the loop, and the activities inside are repeated,
# we can consider the loop as: (what happens before the loop) -> * (loop_condition_check_or_silent_step, loop_body_activities)
# A more standard interpretation for "loop until normal" is that the *entire* loop process repeats,
# where the "exit" condition is checked after each iteration.
# Let's define the loop such that the loop_body_seq is the 'B' part that repeats, and 'tau' is the 'A' part for the loop *operator*.
# The problem statement says: "* ( A, B ) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again"
# This implies A is the initial part of each iteration.
# If "abnormal result" triggers the loop, and "normal result" exits it, then the loop is essentially
# (Specialist Consultation -> Treatment -> Re-Diagnostic Test)
# So, SC -> Treatment -> Re-Diagnostic Test is the 'A' part that is repeated, and 'tau' is the 'B' part if we were to loop a separate "check" step.
# Let's assume the loop applies to the sequence SC -> (TM X SPT) -> (FCE X FBA).
# We can model the loop as * (body, tau) where body is SC -> (TM X SPT) -> (FCE X FBA) and tau represents the decision point.
# A more intuitive model for "loop until normal" often puts the 'check' as the 'B' part that triggers another iteration.
# If the loop 'A' is executed, then 'B' and 'A' again, the 'A' is the "main" part of the loop.
# So, the main part of the loop is the sequence of (SC -> (TM X SPT) -> (FCE X FBA)).
# And 'tau' can represent the internal check to either exit or continue.
# Let's define it as * (loop_body_seq, tau_exit_condition).
# This means loop_body_seq is done, then either exit or tau_exit_condition is done, and loop_body_seq again.
# The tau_exit_condition is a placeholder for the decision of continuing the loop.
