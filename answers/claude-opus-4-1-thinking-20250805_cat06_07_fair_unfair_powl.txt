Based on the textual description, I'll create two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions - one with potential unfairness and one without.

## POWL Model 1: With Potential Unfairness

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create loop for data completeness (execute data check, then optionally request more info and loop back)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Create XOR choice between standard cultural fit and community affiliation check (source of unfairness)
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_check])

# Build the main workflow with sequential ordering
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, cultural_xor, manager_review, final_decision])

# Add sequential edges
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, manager_review)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

## POWL Model 2: Without Unfairness

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create loop for data completeness (execute data check, then optionally request more info and loop back)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Build the main workflow with sequential ordering - no XOR branch for community affiliation
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, cultural_fit, manager_review, final_decision])

# Add sequential edges
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_fit)
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)
root_fair.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

## Key Differences:

**Model 1 (With Unfairness):**
- Contains an XOR branch (`cultural_xor`) after the skill assessment
- Applicants can either go through the standard `CulturalFitCheck` OR the `CommunityAffiliationCheck`
- The `CommunityAffiliationCheck` represents the biased path where local affiliations provide unfair advantages
- This creates two different evaluation paths based on community affiliation status

**Model 2 (Without Unfairness):**
- No XOR branching for cultural evaluation
- All applicants follow the same path through `CulturalFitCheck`
- Ensures equal treatment regardless of community affiliations
- The process is purely sequential with the same evaluation criteria for all candidates

Both models maintain:
- The data completeness loop (ensuring complete applications)
- The sequential flow from application receipt to final decision
- The skill assessment requirement for all candidates

The critical difference is that Model 1 introduces potential discrimination through the XOR branch that allows some candidates to bypass standard evaluation in favor of a community-based assessment, while Model 2 ensures fairness by applying identical evaluation criteria to all applicants.
