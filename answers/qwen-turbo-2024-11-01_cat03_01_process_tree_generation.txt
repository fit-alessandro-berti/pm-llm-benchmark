To construct the process tree for the described hospital patient management scenario, we'll break down each step and use the appropriate operators to reflect the sequence, exclusive choices, loops, and concurrency as specified. Here's how the process tree can be constructed:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Helper function to create a process tree node
def create_process_tree(label=None, operator=None):
    return ProcessTree(label=label, operator=operator)

# Create root node
root = create_process_tree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Arriving and Registration
arrival = create_process_tree(label='A')
registration = create_process_tree(label='RG')
intake_assessment = create_process_tree(label='IA')

# Sequence for registration and intake assessment
reg_ia_sequence = create_process_tree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
reg_ia_sequence.children.append(registration)
reg_ia_sequence.children.append(intake_assessment)

# Adding arrival and reg_ia_sequence to root
root.children.append(arrival)
root.children.append(reg_ia_sequence)

# Triage evaluation
triage_interview = create_process_tree(label='TI')
triage_classification = create_process_tree(label='TC')

# Sequence for triage interview and classification
triage_sequence = create_process_tree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
triage_sequence.children.append(triage_interview)
triage_sequence.children.append(triage_classification)

# Adding triage_sequence to root
root.children.append(triage_sequence)

# Exclusive choice between CE and FBP
comprehensive_ecg = create_process_tree(label='CE')
full_blood_panel = create_process_tree(label='FBP')

exclusive_diagnostic_choice = create_process_tree(operator=Operator.XOR)
exclusive_diagnostic_choice.children.append(comprehensive_ecg)
exclusive_diagnostic_choice.children.append(full_blood_panel)

# Adding exclusive_diagnostic_choice to root
root.children.append(exclusive_diagnostic_choice)

# Loop for abnormal results
specialist_consultation = create_process_tree(label='SC')
targeted_medication = create_process_tree(label='TM')
specialized_physical_therapy = create_process_tree(label='SPT')
re_diagnostic_test = create_process_tree(operator=Operator.XOR)

follow_up_ecg = create_process_tree(label='FCE')
follow_up_blood_analysis = create_process_tree(label='FBA')

re_diagnostic_test.children.append(follow_up_ecg)
re_diagnostic_test.children.append(follow_up_blood_analysis)

# Loop structure
loop_sequence = create_process_tree(operator=Operator.LOOP)
loop_sequence.children.append(specialist_consultation)
loop_sequence.children.append(re_diagnostic_test)

# Adding loop_sequence to root
root.children.append(loop_sequence)

# Advanced diagnostic and support activities in parallel
advanced_imaging = create_process_tree(label='AI')
nutritional_counseling = create_process_tree(label='NC')

parallel_adv_activities = create_process_tree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)
parallel_adv_activities.children.append(advanced_imaging)
parallel_adv_activities.children.append(nutritional_counseling)

# Adding parallel_adv_activities to root
root.children.append(parallel_adv_activities)

# Final sequence of administrative and informational steps
follow_up_appointment_scheduling = create_process_tree(label='FAS')
detailed_discharge_instructions = create_process_tree(label='DDI')

final_sequence = create_process_tree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
final_sequence.children.append(follow_up_appointment_scheduling)
final_sequence.children.append(detailed_discharge_instructions)

# Adding final_sequence to root
root.children.append(final_sequence)

# Concurrency block for final administrative and financial clearances
billing = create_process_tree(label='BL')
insurance_claims_processing = create_process_tree(label='ICP')
medical_records_finalization = create_process_tree(label='MRF')

parallel_financial_clearance = create_process_tree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)
parallel_financial_clearance.children.append(billing)
parallel_financial_clearance.children.append(insurance_claims_processing)
parallel_financial_clearance.children.append(medical_records_finalization)

# Adding parallel_financial_clearance to root
root.children.append(parallel_financial_clearance)

# Function to set parents for children nodes
def set_parents(node, parent):
    node.parent = parent
    for child in node.children:
        set_parents(child, node)

# Setting parents for all nodes
for child in root.children:
    set_parents(child, root)

# Print the constructed process tree
print(root)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Root Node:** The root node is set up to manage parallel activities using `Operator.PARALLEL`.
2. **Arrival and Registration:** These activities are sequenced.
3. **Triage Evaluation:** The triage interview and classification are sequenced.
4. **Exclusive Choice:** The initial diagnostic test is chosen exclusively based on the triage classification.
5. **Loop Structure:** The loop for abnormal results is managed using `Operator.LOOP`.
6. **Parallel Activities:** Advanced imaging and nutritional counseling are done in parallel.
7. **Final Sequence:** Administrative and informational steps are sequenced.
8. **Concurrency Block:** Final administrative and financial clearances are done in parallel.

This process tree accurately represents the described patient management scenario using the provided operators and notation.
