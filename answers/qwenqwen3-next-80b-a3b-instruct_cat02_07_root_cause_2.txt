### **1. Identification of Cases with Performance Issues**

To identify cases with significantly longer durations, we first calculate the **total lead time** for each case — the time between the **Submit Claim** and **Close Claim** events.

| Case ID | Submit Claim Time       | Close Claim Time        | Total Lead Time |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00         | 2024-04-01 10:30         | **1.5 hours**   |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05         | 2024-04-02 11:00         | **25.9 hours**  |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10         | 2024-04-03 09:30         | **48.3 hours**  |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20         | 2024-04-01 10:45         | **1.4 hours**   |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25         | 2024-04-04 14:30         | **79.1 hours**  |

**Performance Issues Identified:**
- **Case 2002**: 25.9 hours — notably longer than low-complexity cases (2001, 2004).
- **Case 2003**: 48.3 hours — over double 2002.
- **Case 2005**: **79.1 hours** — by far the longest, over 3 days.

>  **Conclusion**: **Cases 2003 and 2005** are the primary performance outliers. Case 2002 is moderately delayed but still within a reasonable range for medium complexity. The extreme delays are in **high-complexity cases**.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis: Correlation with Attributes**

#### **A. Complexity Level**
- **Low Complexity (2001, 2004)**: Completed in **~1.5 hours**. No “Request Additional Documents” steps.
- **Medium Complexity (2002)**: One “Request Additional Documents”  25.9 hours total. Delay mainly due to **gap between Request and Approval** (14:00  10:00 next day = 20 hours).
- **High Complexity (2003, 2005)**:
  - **Case 2003**: Two “Request Additional Documents” events  48.3 hours.
  - **Case 2005**: **Three** “Request Additional Documents” events  **79.1 hours**.

>  **Key Insight**:  
> **The number of “Request Additional Documents” events directly correlates with total duration**.  
> High-complexity claims require **multiple rounds of documentation**, creating **sequential delays** while waiting for the claimant to respond.

**Additional Observation**:  
- In **Case 2005**, the third request was made on **2024-04-03 15:00**, and approval didn’t occur until **2024-04-04 10:00** — suggesting **delayed internal processing** after document receipt, not just waiting for the claimant.

#### **B. Resource (Handler) Analysis**

| Resource       | Cases Handled | Avg. Lead Time | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Adjuster_Mike  | 2001, 2003    | (1.5 + 48.3)/2 = **24.9h** | Handled one low (fast) and one high (slow) |
| Adjuster_Lisa  | 2002, 2004, 2005 | (25.9 + 1.4 + 79.1)/3 = **35.5h** | Handled **two high-complexity** cases (2002, 2005) — both delayed |
| Manager_Ann    | 2001, 2002, 2004 | Avg. 10.6h | Only handled low/medium cases |
| Manager_Bill   | 2003, 2005    | Both high-complexity  48.3h and 79.1h | Approvals came after long delays |
| Finance_Carl   | 2002, 2004, 2005 | 25.9h, 1.4h, 79.1h | No clear pattern — payment is usually fast once approved |
| CSR_Jane       | 2001, 2003    | 1.5h, 48.3h | Submission/closing, not processing bottleneck |

>  **Key Insight**:  
> **Adjuster_Lisa** handled **two high-complexity cases (2002 and 2005)** — both had **multiple document requests**, and **Case 2005** had **three** requests.  
> **Manager_Bill** handled **both high-complexity cases that took >48 hours** — suggesting **approval bottlenecks** under his supervision.

**Critical Pattern**:  
- **Case 2005**: Adjuster_Lisa made **three** document requests  Manager_Bill approved **only after 3 days**.  
- **Case 2003**: Adjuster_Mike made **two** requests  Manager_Bill approved after **~24 hours**.  
 So **Manager_Bill** may be **slower to approve** high-complexity claims, especially when multiple requests are involved.

#### **C. Region Analysis**

| Region | Cases | Avg. Lead Time | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------|
| A      | 2001, 2003 | (1.5 + 48.3)/2 = **24.9h** | One low, one high |
| B      | 2002, 2004, 2005 | (25.9 + 1.4 + 79.1)/3 = **35.5h** | Two high-complexity cases, one low |

>  **Key Insight**:  
> Region B has **higher average lead time**, but this is **entirely driven by high-complexity cases**.  
> **Region A** had a slow case (2003) — so **region alone is not the root cause**.  
> However, Region B has **more high-complexity cases** (2 out of 3), and **Adjuster_Lisa** (who handles most of them) is based in Region B.

>  **Conclusion**:  
> **Region is not a direct cause**, but **indirectly correlated** because:
> - Region B has **higher volume of high-complexity claims**.
> - Region B is handled by **Adjuster_Lisa**, who is involved in **both delayed high-complexity cases**.

### **3. Root Cause Summary**

| Root Cause | Evidence | Impact |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **High Complexity Leads to Multiple Document Requests** | Cases 2003 (2 requests), 2005 (3 requests). Each request adds 12–48+ hours waiting time. |  **Primary Cause** — delays are cumulative and non-linear. |
| **Inefficient Handling of High-Complexity Claims by Adjuster_Lisa** | She handled 2/3 of all high-complexity cases, and **both** had multiple requests. Her workflow may lack standardization or automation for complex cases. |  **Secondary Cause** — potential inconsistency in triaging/document requests. |
| **Manager_Bill’s Approval Delays** | Approved both longest cases (2003, 2005) after long gaps — especially in 2005, where approval lagged 19+ hours after last document. |  **Secondary Cause** — possible backlog or lack of SLA enforcement for high-complexity approvals. |
| **Region B’s Higher Load** | Higher concentration of high-complexity claims  systemically longer times. |  **Contributing Factor**, not root — region reflects claim type distribution. |

### **4. Recommendations to Mitigate Root Causes**

####  **1. Automate & Standardize Document Requests for High-Complexity Claims**
- **Problem**: Manual, iterative requests cause delays (e.g., 3 requests in Case 2005).
- **Solution**:  
  - Implement a **“Complex Claim Checklist”** triggered automatically upon “Evaluate Claim” for High Complexity.  
  - System generates **all required documents in one request**, reducing iterative loops.  
  - Use **AI-based document prediction** (e.g., based on claim type, history) to pre-populate request list.

####  **2. Introduce SLAs and Escalation Triggers for High-Complexity Approvals**
- **Problem**: Manager_Bill took >24 hours to approve after final document submission.
- **Solution**:  
  - Set **SLA of 12 hours** for approval after final document receipt for high-complexity claims.  
  - If SLA breached  auto-escalate to **senior manager** or **team lead**.  
  - Implement **dashboard alerts** for pending high-complexity approvals.

####  **3. Reassign or Train Adjuster_Lisa for High-Complexity Cases**
- **Problem**: Adjuster_Lisa handled 3 high-complexity cases  2 with excessive requests.
- **Solution**:  
  - Audit Adjuster_Lisa’s workflow: Why 3 requests in Case 2005? Was documentation unclear?  
  - Provide **specialized training** for high-complexity claims, or  
  - **Rotate high-complexity cases** among adjusters to avoid overburdening one person.  
  - Consider assigning **dedicated high-complexity adjusters** (not generalists).

####  **4. Regional Workload Balancing (Optional)**
- Region B has more high-complexity claims — perhaps due to customer demographics or product types.
- **Recommendation**:  
  - Analyze *why* Region B has more high-complexity claims.  
  - If due to product mix, consider **redesigning product offerings** or **pre-screening** at submission stage.

####  **5. Implement End-to-End Case Monitoring Dashboard**
- Real-time tracking of:
  - Time since last document request
  - Number of document requests per case
  - Pending approvals by manager
- Enables proactive intervention (e.g., “Case 2005: 3rd document request — 48h since last update”).

### **Final Summary**

| Category | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| **Worst Performing Cases** | **2005 (79.1h)**, **2003 (48.3h)** — both high complexity with multiple document requests |
| **Primary Root Cause** | **High complexity  multiple document requests  cumulative delays** |
| **Secondary Root Causes** | Inconsistent adjuster workflow (Adjuster_Lisa), delayed approvals (Manager_Bill) |
| **Region** | Not a direct cause, but correlated due to higher concentration of complex claims |
| **Key Action Items** | 1. Standardize document requests for complex claims<br>2. Enforce SLAs on approvals<br>3. Train/reassign adjusters handling complex claims<br>4. Implement monitoring dashboard |

>  **Pro Tip**: Reducing the **number of document requests per high-complexity claim from 31** could cut lead time by **~60%**, based on observed delays. This single change could bring 2005’s duration down from 79h to ~30h — a massive operational improvement.
