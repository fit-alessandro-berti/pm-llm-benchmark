Here's a suitable benchmark SQL query carefully following the instructions provided:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

### Explanation:
- The inner query (`subquery`) identifies the `case_id` values of cases grouped by `case_id`, adding a `HAVING` filter to select only the cases containing 6 or fewer events.
- The outer query then selects all events from `event_log` that belong to the filtered set of `case_id`s produced by the subquery.

This query clearly satisfies the requirement of returning only the events belonging to cases with at most 6 events, excluding cases with more than 6 events.
