Excellent. This is a classic and challenging scenario perfectly suited for an integrated process mining and advanced scheduling approach. As a Senior Operations Analyst, here is my detailed, data-driven plan to transform Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling capabilities.

***

### **Executive Summary**

Precision Parts Inc.'s operational struggles stem from a fundamental mismatch between its complex, dynamic job shop environment and its simplistic, static scheduling rules. The current approach is blind to real-time shop floor dynamics, sequence-dependencies, and the cascading effects of local decisions. This proposal outlines a systematic approach using process mining to move from a reactive, fire-fighting mode to a proactive, data-driven, and predictive scheduling paradigm. We will first use historical MES data to create a "digital twin" of the current process, precisely diagnosing the root causes of inefficiency. Then, we will design, simulate, and deploy advanced scheduling strategies that dynamically adapt to the real-world state of the shop floor, directly addressing the core challenges of tardiness, WIP, and poor utilization.

### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

The first step is to transform the raw MES event log into an objective, quantitative understanding of the *as-is* process. This is the diagnostic foundation for all subsequent improvements.

**Reconstructing the Process Flow:**
Using a process mining platform (e.g., Celonis, UiPath Process Mining, PM4Py), we will structure the event log by defining:
*   **Case ID:** `Case ID (Job ID)`
*   **Activity:** A combination of `Activity/Task` and `Event Type` (e.g., 'Cutting Setup Start', 'Cutting Task End', 'Milling Queue Entry'). This provides the necessary granularity.
*   **Timestamp:** `Timestamp`
*   **Resource:** `Resource (Machine ID)` and/or `Operator ID`

This structure allows the software to automatically reconstruct the end-to-end flow of every job through the shop, creating a dynamic process map that visualizes the actual, not the theoretical, paths jobs take.

**Key Process Mining Techniques and Metrics:**

*   **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan:**
    *   **Technique:** Case Duration Analysis. We will calculate the cycle time for every job from `Job Released` to the final `Task End` event.
    *   **Metrics:** We will analyze the distribution of these lead times (mean, median, 90th percentile, standard deviation) to quantify unpredictability. A dotted chart will visualize the lifecycle of every job, immediately highlighting long-running jobs and their timing. Makespan (time from the first job start to the last job's completion for a given period) will be calculated to measure overall production throughput over time.

*   **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):**
    *   **Technique:** Activity-level performance analysis. For each task, we will calculate the waiting time as `Timestamp(Setup Start or Task Start) - Timestamp(Queue Entry)`.
    *   **Metrics:** We will create dashboards showing the average and maximum waiting times for each resource (e.g., `CUT-01`, `MILL-03`). This will be the primary indicator for identifying bottlenecks. We can visualize this directly on the process map, highlighting edges with long wait times.

*   **Resource (Machine and Operator) Utilization:**
    *   **Technique:** Resource-centric analysis and dashboarding.
    *   **Metrics:** For each machine, we will break down its time into four states based on the event log:
        1.  **Productive Time:** Sum of `Task Duration (Actual)`.
        2.  **Setup Time:** Sum of time between `Setup Start` and `Setup End`.
        3.  **Breakdown/Downtime:** Sum of time the resource is in a `Breakdown` state.
        4.  **Idle Time:** Total Time - (Productive + Setup + Breakdown).
        This provides a true picture of utilization and highlights opportunities. We can do the same for operators to understand their workload.

*   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
    *   **Technique:** Context-aware data filtering and aggregation.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a critical analysis. For each machine, we will:
        1.  Filter the event log for that specific resource (e.g., `MILL-03`).
        2.  Chronologically order the events.
        3.  For each job's `Setup Start` event, we will use the `Notes` field (or infer from the preceding job on that machine) to identify the `Previous Job`.
        4.  We will build a **Setup Time Matrix**: `(Previous_Job_Family, Current_Job_Family) -> [Avg_Setup_Time, StdDev_Setup_Time]`. "Job Family" could be defined by material, size, or required tooling. This matrix quantitatively models the sequence-dependency and will be a core input for advanced scheduling.

*   **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
    *   **Technique:** Conformance Checking and KPI monitoring.
    *   **Metrics:** For each job, we calculate **Tardiness** = `Timestamp(Final Task End) - Order Due Date`. We will measure:
        *   Percentage of Tardy Jobs.
        *   Average Tardiness (for late jobs).
        *   A histogram of tardiness to see if we are late by a little or a lot.

*   **Impact of Disruptions:**
    *   **Technique:** Variant Analysis and Comparative Analysis.
    *   **Analysis:** We will create two cohorts of jobs:
        1.  **"Affected by Breakdown":** Jobs that were in queue for or being processed by a machine when it broke down.
        2.  **"Disrupted by Hot Job":** Jobs that were in queue when a `High (Urgent)` priority job was expedited ahead of them.
    *   By comparing the lead times and waiting times of these cohorts against a baseline of "normal" jobs, we can precisely quantify the ripple effect and cost of disruptions.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

With the quantitative analysis complete, we can pinpoint specific, evidence-backed inefficiencies.

*   **Bottleneck Identification:** The process map and waiting time dashboards will clearly show which machine(s) have the longest queues and highest utilization (Productive + Setup time). We can state, "Machine `MILL-03` is our primary bottleneck, contributing to 40% of the total waiting time across all jobs and operating at 95% capacity, leaving no room for disruption."

*   **Evidence of Poor Task Prioritization:** We will filter for jobs with `Order Priority = High` that were completed late. By examining their process journey, we can show instances where they waited in a queue behind several `Medium` or `Low` priority jobs, directly proving that the FCFS rule is overriding the EDD/Priority rule to the detriment of the business. Variant analysis comparing on-time vs. late high-priority jobs will make this visually undeniable.

*   **Quantifying Suboptimal Sequencing:** Using the Setup Time Matrix, we can replay the historical sequence of jobs on a bottleneck machine and calculate the total setup time incurred. We can then run an optimization algorithm (e.g., a simple nearest-neighbor heuristic) on the same set of jobs to find a better sequence. The output would be: "On machine `CUT-01` last month, the actual sequence resulted in 85 hours of setup. An optimized sequence of the same jobs could have been completed with only 55 hours of setup, freeing up 30 hours of productive capacity."

*   **Identifying Resource Starvation:** By creating a Gantt chart view for all resources, we can find instances where a downstream machine (e.g., `GRIND-02`) was idle for hours, while its primary upstream feeder machine (`MILL-03`) had a long queue. This proves a lack of coordination and a "bullwhip effect" where upstream delays cause downstream starvation.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

Diagnosing pathologies is good; understanding their root causes is better.

*   **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:** The core root cause is that rules like "First-Come-First-Served" or "Earliest Due Date" are one-dimensional. They ignore crucial context like sequence-dependent setups, downstream resource availability, and real-time queue lengths. Our analysis will show that rigidly following FCFS leads to massive setup times, while rigidly following EDD can cause low-priority jobs to wait indefinitely.

*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** The current system makes decisions locally without a global view. A scheduler at the Cutting station doesn't know that the Milling station is about to go down for maintenance or is already starved for work. This leads to locally optimal but globally suboptimal decisions.

*   **Inaccurate Estimations:** By comparing `Task Duration (Planned)` vs. `Task Duration (Actual)`, we can create distributions showing the inaccuracy of plans. If planned times are consistently wrong, any schedule built on them is unreliable from the start.

*   **Ineffective Handling of Disruptions:** Our analysis of "hot jobs" will show how they disrupt the flow, but the root cause is the lack of a systemic strategy. Instead of intelligently re-prioritizing, the system likely just shoves the hot job to the front, creating a cascade of delays for all other jobs.

**Differentiating Scheduling Logic vs. Capacity Limitations:**
Process mining is key here.
*   A **capacity limitation** is identified when a resource has extremely high utilization (>90%) composed mostly of productive and setup time, with a consistently long and growing queue. Even with perfect scheduling, this resource cannot keep up. The solution is investment, offloading, or process re-engineering.
*   A **scheduling logic failure** is identified when a resource has significant idle time *despite* having jobs in its queue. For example, if `GRIND-02` is idle for 2 hours while 5 jobs are waiting for it, this points to a scheduling failure (e.g., waiting for a specific operator, poor batching logic, or data errors). The solution is a better scheduling algorithm.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

Based on our findings, we will propose a phased implementation of sophisticated scheduling strategies.

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Composite Dispatching Rule**

This is an immediate, high-impact improvement over the current static rules.
*   **Core Logic:** Instead of FCFS or EDD, we implement a weighted scoring function at each work center to decide which job to process next from the queue. The job with the highest score is chosen.
    `Score = w1 * Priority_Value + w2 * Critical_Ratio + w3 * (1 / Setup_Score) + w4 * Downstream_Factor`
    *   **Priority_Value:** Numerical value for High/Medium/Low priority.
    *   **Critical_Ratio:** (Due Date - Current Time) / Remaining Processing Time. Values < 1 are urgent.
    *   **Setup_Score:** An estimate of the setup time required based on the job currently on the machine and the next candidate job, pulled directly from our mined **Setup Time Matrix**. A low setup time yields a high score.
    *   **Downstream_Factor:** A score based on the queue length of the *next* machine in the job's routing. This prioritizes jobs that will feed a starving downstream resource.
*   **Data Source:** All inputs are derived from the MES and our process mining analysis (Setup Time Matrix, historical processing times for Critical Ratio).
*   **Pathology Addressed:** Poor task prioritization, excessive setup times, resource starvation.
*   **Expected Impact:** Reduced tardiness (due to Critical Ratio), increased throughput (due to setup optimization), smoother overall flow (due to Downstream Factor), and higher resource utilization.

#### **Strategy 2: Predictive Lead Time & Bottleneck Forecasting**

This strategy moves from reactive dispatching to proactive planning.
*   **Core Logic:** Use machine learning (e.g., Gradient Boosted Trees) on the historical event log to build predictive models for:
    1.  **Task Duration:** Predict the duration of each task based on features like `Job Family`, `Material`, `Machine ID`, and `Operator ID`. The output is not a single number but a probable range (e.g., 55-65 mins).
    2.  **Job Lead Time:** Predict the total completion time for a new order upon its arrival.
*   **Data Source:** The entire historical event log is the training set.
*   **Pathology Addressed:** Unpredictable lead times, ineffective handling of disruptions.
*   **Expected Impact:**
    *   **Accurate Quoting:** Provide customers with realistic due dates with confidence intervals.
    *   **Proactive Bottleneck ID:** By simulating the flow of current jobs with predicted durations, we can forecast that `MILL-03` will become a bottleneck in 2 days and take action now.
    *   **"What-if" Analysis:** When a "hot job" arrives, we can simulate its impact on all other jobs' predicted completion times, allowing for an intelligent, data-backed decision on how to sequence it.

#### **Strategy 3: Global Setup Optimization via Look-Ahead Batching**

This is a more advanced strategy targeting bottleneck machines.
*   **Core Logic:** Instead of the machine pulling the next best job (Strategy 1), a central scheduling engine "looks ahead" at the queue for a bottleneck machine (e.g., the next 10 jobs scheduled to arrive). It then solves a local optimization problem (a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem) to find the sequence for those 10 jobs that minimizes the *total* setup time, while still respecting due date constraints. It might batch several "steel" jobs together, even if one is of slightly lower priority, because the saved setup time benefits all subsequent jobs.
*   **Data Source:** The **Setup Time Matrix** is the critical input. Real-time queue information and job due dates are also required.
*   **Pathology Addressed:** Suboptimal sequencing at bottlenecks, which is a primary driver of lost capacity.
*   **Expected Impact:** A significant increase in the effective capacity and throughput of bottleneck resources, directly boosting the entire shop's output without any capital investment.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

Deploying new scheduling logic live is risky. We must test and validate it first.

**Discrete-Event Simulation:**
We will build a discrete-event simulation model of the entire job shop. This model will be a high-fidelity "digital twin" of the operations, parameterized with the distributions and models derived from our process mining analysis:
*   **Job Arrival:** Modeled based on historical patterns.
*   **Process Routing:** Using the variants and probabilities discovered in the process map.
*   **Task Durations:** Using the statistical distributions (e.g., log-normal) mined from actuals.
*   **Resource Schedules:** Including shifts and planned maintenance.
*   **Breakdown Models:** Using MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) and MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) calculated from the event log.
*   **Setup Times:** Directly using the **Setup Time Matrix**.

We will then run simulations comparing the baseline (current FCFS/EDD rules) against our three proposed strategies across various scenarios (e.g., normal load, high load, frequent breakdowns) and measure the impact on KPIs: `Tardiness`, `WIP`, `Lead Time`, `Throughput`, and `Resource Utilization`. This provides a risk-free environment to prove the ROI of each strategy and fine-tune the parameters (e.g., the weights in Strategy 1).

**Continuous Improvement Framework:**
The project does not end at deployment. We will establish a continuous monitoring loop:
1.  **Monitor:** Deploy real-time dashboards tracking the key KPIs identified in the analysis phase.
2.  **Conformance Check:** Use process mining to continuously check if the new scheduling logic is being executed as designed. Are there deviations? Why?
3.  **Detect Drift:** The models (especially the setup matrix and duration predictions) can become stale. We will set up automated monitoring to detect concept drift. For example, if actual setup times start deviating significantly from the matrix, the system will flag it for re-analysis.
4.  **Adapt:** Periodically (e.g., quarterly), we will re-run the process mining analysis on the latest data to refine the scheduling models, update the simulation, and identify new emerging bottlenecks or pathologies. This ensures the scheduling system evolves and remains optimized as the business changes.
