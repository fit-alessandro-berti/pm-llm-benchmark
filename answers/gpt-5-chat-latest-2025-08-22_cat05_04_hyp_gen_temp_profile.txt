Here’s the structured analysis of the temporal profile model, along with hypotheses and concrete verification methods using SQL queries against the given database schema.

## 1. Anomalies in the Temporal Profile

- **R  P (Receive  Approve)**  
  Average ~25 hours, but an extremely low standard deviation (~1 hour).  
   Suggests approvals occur on an artificially tight schedule with little variance, which is unusual for real-world insurance claims.

- **P  N (Approve  Notify)**  
  Average delay is about 7 days with very high variability (±2 days).  
   Indicates inconsistent communication practices: sometimes customers wait far longer than expected or are notified late due to backlogs.

- **A  C (Assign  Close)**  
  Average of 2 hours between assigning an adjuster and claim closure, often skipping evaluation or approval.  
   Implies some claims may be closed prematurely, possibly without due diligence.

- **E  N (Evaluate  Notify)**  
  Average of only 5 minutes.  
   Suspiciously fast; real evaluation results shouldn’t be communicated almost instantly. Indicates possible bypassing of approval or manual adjustments in timestamps.

## 2. Hypotheses on Why These Anomalies Exist

- **R  P anomaly (tight distribution):**
  - Approvals may be scheduled via an automated system at standardized daily cutoff times.  
  - Business rules or system constraints force uniformity (e.g., daily batch approval runs).  
  - Possible data recording artifact where “approve” timestamps are system-generated rather than event-driven.

- **P  N anomaly (long & inconsistent delays):**
  - Staff backlog or lack of notification automation leading to delayed communication.  
  - Customer notification dependent on separate departments or different channels (e.g., email vs postal).  
  - Handovers between regions/resources increase variance.

- **A  C anomaly (fast closure):**
  - Certain claim types (e.g., small, obvious, or invalid claims) are auto-closed with minimal handling.  
  - Misuse of process where claims are closed right after assignment without full investigation.  
  - Cleanup scripts closing stale records.

- **E  N anomaly (instant notifications):**
  - Automated notifications triggered immediately after adjuster updates evaluation notes.  
  - Missing approval step in some workflows, possibly due to relaxed rules for low-value claims.  
  - Potential system bug skipping required approvals.

## 3. Verification Approaches with SQL Queries

**(a) Detect uniform approval times (R  P low variability):**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END) AS receive_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) -
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS seconds_between
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
   AND MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY seconds_between;
```
 Check if most claims have nearly identical `seconds_between` values  indicates artificial scheduling.

---

**(b) Evaluate P  N long delays:**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) -
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS seconds_between,
    c.claim_type,
    a.region
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = e.resource::INTEGER
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.region
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
   AND MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY seconds_between DESC;
```
 Correlate excessive delays with regions or claim types.

**(c) Identify fast closures after assignment (A  C anomaly):**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END) AS assign_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) -
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS seconds_between
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
   AND MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
   AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) -
                           MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END))) < 7200
ORDER BY seconds_between ASC;
```
 Detect claims closed too quickly (under 2 hours), possibly without evaluation or approval.

**(d) Spot almost instant E  N steps:**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN e.timestamp END) AS eval_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) -
                        MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS seconds_between
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN e.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
   AND MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
   AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) -
                           MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN e.timestamp END))) < 600
ORDER BY seconds_between ASC;
```
 Identify claims where customer notification happens within 10 minutes of evaluation.

 These analyses pinpoint unusual process timings, provide grounded hypotheses for why they occur, and suggest direct SQL checks to validate against the claims history.  

Would you like me to create an **automatic anomaly detection query** that flags claims breaking the expected mean±ZETA·STDEV for *all* activity pairs in the temporal profile (instead of one step at a time)?
