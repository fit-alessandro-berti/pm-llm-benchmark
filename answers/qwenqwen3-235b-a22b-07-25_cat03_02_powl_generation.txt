import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Define individual transitions for each labeled activity
SR = Transition(label="Service Request")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")

DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")

BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")  # Note: '&' in label is allowed as string

CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")

QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Step 2: Create the loop for the configuration phase: * (BNC, D&R)
# LOOP operator: first execute BNC, then optionally repeat D&R and BNC
config_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Step 3: Create the exclusive choice between deployment methods: X (CD, MD)
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 4: Create partial order for concurrent tasks DA and ACI, both after CS
pre_config_phase = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
# No order between DA and ACI — they are concurrent
# But both depend on CS, which will be handled in the global order

# Step 5: Create partial order for QA and SA — can be concurrent, but both must finish before GLA
post_deployment_phase = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
# No order between QA and SA — they can be concurrent
# Both must precede GLA

# Step 6: Build the root partial order containing all high-level components in sequence
root_nodes = [SR, CS, pre_config_phase, config_loop, deployment_choice, post_deployment_phase, GLA]
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=root_nodes)

# Define the execution order constraints (partial order edges):

# 1. SR -> CS
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# 2. CS must complete before DA and ACI can start
root.order.add_edge(CS, pre_config_phase)

# 3. pre_config_phase (i.e., both DA and ACI) must complete before config_loop starts
root.order.add_edge(pre_config_phase, config_loop)

# 4. config_loop must complete before deployment_choice
root.order.add_edge(config_loop, deployment_choice)

# 5. deployment_choice must complete before post_deployment_phase (QA and SA)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, post_deployment_phase)

# 6. post_deployment_phase (i.e., both QA and SA) must complete before GLA
root.order.add_edge(post_deployment_phase, GLA)

# Final POWL model is 'root', which represents the entire process
# This model captures:
# - Sequential flow: SR  CS  (DA || ACI)  [BNC (+ D&R loop)]  (CD XOR MD)  (QA || SA)  GLA
# - Concurrency: DA/ACI, QA/SA
# - Loop: BNC followed by optional D&R
# - Exclusive choice: CD or MD

# Optional: You can return or use 'root' for further processing (e.g., discovery, simulation)

###  Summary of the Model Structure:

- **Sequence**:  
  `SR  CS  [DA || ACI]  [BNC (+ optional D&R loop)]  [CD XOR MD]  [QA || SA]  GLA`

- **Control-flow Constructs**:
  - `LOOP`: `(BNC, D&R)` — execute BNC, then optionally repeat D&R and BNC.
  - `XOR`: `(CD, MD)` — choose one deployment method.
  - `StrictPartialOrder`: Used for concurrent phases (DA/ACI), (QA/SA), and global sequencing.

- **Concurrency**:
  - DA and ACI run in parallel after CS.
  - QA and SA run in parallel after deployment.

- **Dependencies**:
  - All steps are correctly ordered with `.add_edge()` to enforce prerequisites.

This POWL model fully captures the described telecom service provisioning workflow with mixed control-flow patterns.
