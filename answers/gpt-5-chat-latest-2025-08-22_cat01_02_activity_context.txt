Got it  — let’s carefully analyze and contextualize the repeated activities, then relabel them for clarity.

---

## Step 1. Identify recurring activities and contextual differences
Across the log, some activities **repeat within the same case** but serve different purposes:

- **Verify Documents**  
  - Initially: first verification of ID/docs.  
  - Later: second/re-check/re-verification after new or corrected information is provided.  
   These need disambiguation as *Initial Document Verification* vs *Follow-up Document Verification*.

- **Call Customer**  
  - Sometimes it’s to request missing documents.  
  - Sometimes it’s to clarify account discrepancies.  
  - Sometimes it’s a follow-up confirmation call.  
  - Sometimes it’s to call the customer back to the branch.  
   Each should reflect its intention: *Request More Documents Call*, *Clarification Call*, *Confirmation Call*, *Recall to Branch Call*.

- **Initiate Request** occurs via different channels (web vs branch)  worth differentiating by channel: *Initiate Request (WebPortal)* vs *Initiate Request (Branch)*.

- **Adjust Account** is always about internal correction. We don’t see significantly different meanings across cases, so no renaming beyond its current name is strictly necessary.

- **Approve Request** is always the same (final supervisor approval). Consistent and unambiguous.

## Step 2. Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities

```  
| Case ID | Activity                           | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |

| C001    | Approve Request                    | 2024-05-01 10:45:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

| C002    | Initiate Request (WebPortal)       | 2024-05-02 08:05:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C002    | Initial Document Verification      | 2024-05-02 08:15:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Identity verification.                                     |
| C002    | Clarification Call                 | 2024-05-02 09:00:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.              |
| C002    | Adjust Account                     | 2024-05-02 09:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Adjust account details internally after call.              |
| C002    | Confirmation Call                  | 2024-05-02 09:50:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made.                |
| C002    | Approve Request                    | 2024-05-02 10:05:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

| C003    | Initiate Request (BranchVisit)     | 2024-05-03 11:20:00 | BranchReception  | Walk-in customer at branch.                                |

| C003    | Recall to Branch Call              | 2024-05-03 11:50:00 | BranchOfficer    | Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return.   |
| C003    | Adjust Account                     | 2024-05-03 12:05:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Internal correction due to missing info.                   |
| C003    | Post-Adjustment Document Verification | 2024-05-03 12:20:00 | BranchOfficer | Re-verify docs after account adjustment.                   |
| C003    | Approve Request                    | 2024-05-03 12:30:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |
```

## Step 3. Justification of Renaming Choices
- **Verify Documents  Initial vs Follow-up/Post-Adjustment Verification**  
  Context: occurs before and after receiving additional docs or adjustments. The renaming separates the *first check* from the *re-check*.

- **Call Customer  Request, Clarification, Confirmation, Recall Calls**  
  Context: the call purpose is explicit in "Additional Context." Shifting the name to reflect intent improves process traceability.

- **Initiate Request  By Channel**  
  Context: requests initiated via *WebPortal* vs *BranchVisit* matter since channel differences often influence SLAs and resource needs.

- **Approve Request** remains unchanged as it consistently represents supervisor-level finalization.  
- **Adjust Account** remains stable: always an internal data correction step.

 This disambiguation improves **process transparency**: someone analyzing the log can now distinguish between first-time document verification and follow-up checks, or between different types of calls to customers.

Would you like me to also **cluster the renamed activities into a process map outline** (e.g. “Phase 1: Intake, Phase 2: Verification, etc.”) to make the workflow structure even clearer?
