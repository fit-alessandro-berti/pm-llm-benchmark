<think>
Okay, I need to create an accepting Petri net for this insurance claim management process. Let me start by understanding the scenario thoroughly. The process has several steps, some of which can have loops or branches. The main steps are CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL. Also, after DV, there's a possibility of RDS, and after FC, there's II which can happen multiple times. The initial marking should have a token in the start place, and the final marking should have the token in the closure place.

First, I'll outline all the places and transitions. Let me list them:

Places:
- Start (maybe a place called 'Start')
- Claim Registration (CR)
- Document Verification (DV)
- Re-Document Submission (RDS)
- Fraud Check (FC)
- In-depth Investigation (II)
- Claim Assessment (CA)
- Approval (AP)
- Payment (P)
- Notification (N)
- Closure (CL)
- Maybe some intermediate places for the loops? Or maybe transitions that loop back?

Transitions:
- CR: starts the process
- DV: after CR
- RDS: after DV (if needed)
- FC: after DV (or after RDS? Or after DV and RDS? Wait, the RDS is a re-submission step. So after DV, if documents are incomplete, the process goes to RDS. Then after RDS, it should go back to DV again? Or maybe after RDS, it goes back to DV again? Or maybe after RDS, it goes to DV again? Or maybe after RDS, it's back to DV again? Or maybe RDS is a separate transition that loops back to DV?

Similarly, after FC, there's II. If II is performed multiple times, then the FC transition might loop to II, and after II, it loops back to FC again? Or maybe after II, it goes back to FC again?

So for the loops, I need to have transitions that can loop back. For example, after DV, there's a possibility of going to RDS, which then loops back to DV. Similarly, FC can loop to II, which can loop back to FC again.

So the structure would be:

Start -> CR -> DV -> (RDS or continue to FC) ?

Wait, the process is: after DV, either the documents are complete, and then proceed to FC, or they are incomplete, so RDS is done, then back to DV again. So that's a loop between DV and RDS.

Similarly, after FC, there's II. If II is done, then back to FC again. So FC can have a loop to II, and II can loop back to FC again.

So the transitions would be:

CR (transition) from Start to DV.

DV (place) has a transition to RDS, and another transition to FC.

RDS (transition) leads back to DV.

FC (transition) leads to II, and another transition leads to CA.

II (transition) leads back to FC.

But wait, maybe the FC transition is followed by a loop to II, and after II, back to FC again. So FC can have a loop to II, and II loops back to FC.

But how to model that? So FC is a transition that connects to II. Then II is a transition that connects back to FC. So that's a loop.

So, the transitions would be:

CR (start) -> DV (place) -> RDS (transition) -> DV (place) again?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The DV is a place. So the transitions would be:

- After CR, the token is in DV place. Then, from DV place, there are two transitions: one to RDS, and another to FC. So the transitions are:

DV -> RDS and DV -> FC.

Then, RDS is a transition that leads to DV again? Or maybe RDS is a transition that leads to DV again. So RDS is a transition that, when fired, moves the token back to DV.

Similarly, FC is a transition that leads to II. Then II is a transition that leads back to FC. So that's a loop between FC and II.

So, the structure would be:

Start -> CR (transition) -> DV (place) -> RDS (transition) -> DV (place) again. But how to model that? Or maybe after RDS, the token is in DV again. So RDS is a transition that leads to DV. Then, from DV, you can go to FC or RDS again.

Similarly, FC is a transition that leads to II, and II leads back to FC.

Now, for the other steps:

After FC, the transition is to CA. Then CA leads to AP. AP leads to P. P leads to N. N leads to CL.

So the transitions would be:

DV -> RDS (loop back to DV)

DV -> FC

FC -> II (loop back to FC)

FC -> CA

CA -> AP

AP -> P

P -> N

N -> CL

But I need to make sure that the transitions are properly connected.

Now, the initial marking is a start place with a token. The final marking is the closure place with a token.

So the places would be:

Start (initial place), CR (transition), DV (place), RDS (transition), FC (transition), II (transition), CA (transition), AP (transition), P (transition), N (transition), CL (place).

Wait, but transitions are named, and places are named. So the transitions would be:

CR: transition, DV: place, RDS: transition, FC: transition, II: transition, CA: transition, AP: restriction, P: transition, N: transition, CL: place.

Wait, but the transitions are named. So the transitions would be:

CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL?

No, CL is a place. So the transitions are: CR (start), DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N.

Wait, the transitions are the activities. So the transitions are:

CR: Claim Registration

DV: Document Verification

RDS: Re-Document Submission

FC: Fraud Check

II: In-depth Investigation

CA: Claim Assessment

AP: Approval

P: Payment

N: Notification

CL: Closure (but that's a place, not a transition. Wait, the final marking is the closure place. So the transitions leading to CL would be N, which leads to CL place.

So the transitions would be:

CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N.

The places are: Start, CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

Wait, but the Start is a place, and the first transition is CR. So the initial marking would have a token in the Start place. Then, CR is a transition that leads to DV.

Wait, maybe the Start place is not a place but a transition? Or maybe the Start is a place that has a token, and the first transition is CR. So the initial marking is Start: 1.

So the Petri net would have:

Places:

Start, CR (place?), no. Wait, the transitions are the activities. So the places are the states. The transitions are the steps.

So the structure is:

Start (place) has a token. Then, the transition CR is connected to the place DV. So CR is a transition that leads to DV.

So the places are:

Start (initial place), DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL (final place).

But that's not correct. Because the transitions are the steps. So the initial place is Start. Then, the first transition is CR, which is a transition that connects to DV place.

So the structure is:

Start (place) has a token. Then, the transition CR is connected to the place DV. So when the CR is fired, the token moves from Start to DV.

Then, the place DV has transitions to RDS and FC.

So the code would need to create these transitions and arcs.

Now, the code steps:

Import the necessary classes.

Create a PetriNet object.

Add the places and transitions.

Add arcs between them.

Now, the initial marking is Marking with Start:1.

The final marking is Marking with CL:1.

But wait, the final marking is the state where the claim is closed. So the final place is CL, and the final marking has a token in CL.

So the code would have:

Create the PetriNet, add the places and transitions.

Now, for the steps:

Start place.

CR transition.

DV place.

RDS transition.

FC transition.

II transition.

CA transition.

AP transition.

P transition.

N transition.

CL place.

Then, arcs:

Start -> CR.

CR -> DV.

DV -> RDS.

DV -> FC.

RDS -> DV.

FC -> II.

FC -> CA.

II -> FC.

CA -> AP.

AP -> P.

P -> N.

N -> CL.

Wait, but the II transition would need to loop back to FC. So the arc from II to FC.

But how to model that? Because the FC is a transition, but the II is a transition. So after II is fired, the token moves to FC place? Or is FC a place?

Wait, no. The transitions are the steps. So the transitions are CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N.

Wait, but the transitions are the steps. So the transitions are:

CR (transition) leads to DV (place).

DV (place) has transitions to RDS (transition) and FC (transition).

RDS (transition) leads to DV (place).

FC (transition) leads to II (transition) and CA (transition).

II (transition) leads to FC (transition).

CA (transition) leads to AP (transition).

AP (transition) leads to P (transition).

P (transition) leads to N (transition).

N (transition) leads to CL (place).

Wait, but the CL is a place. So when N is fired, the token moves to CL place.

But in the initial code example, the final marking is a Marking with sink:1. So in this case, the final place is CL.

So the code would have:

Add all the places and transitions.

Now, the code:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet(name="InsuranceClaimProcess")

# Places
start_place = PetriNet.Place(name="Start")
dv_place = PetriNet.Place(name="DV")
rds_place = PetriNet.Place(name="RDS")
fc_place = PetriNet.Place(name="FC")
ii_place = PetriNet.Place(name="II")
ca_place = PetriNet.Place(name="CA")
ap_place = PetriNet.Place(name="AP")
p_place = PetriNet.Place(name="P")
n_place = PetriNet.Place(name="N")
cl_place = PetriNet.Place(name="CL")

net.places.add(start_place)
net.places.add(dv_place)
net.places.add(rds_place)
net.places.add(fc_place)
net.places.add(ii_place)
net.places.add(ca_place)
net.places.add(ap_place)
net.places.add(p_place)
net.places.add(n_place)
net.places.add(cl_place)

# Transitions

dv_transition = PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification")
rds_transition = PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission")
fc_transition = PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Fraud Check")
ii_transition = PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="In-depth Investigation")
ca_transition = PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment")
ap_transition = PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval")
p_transition = PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment")
n_transition = PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification")

net.transitions.add(cr_transition)
net.transitions.add(dv_transition)
net.transitions.add(rds_transition)
net.transitions.add(fc_transition)
net.transitions.add(ii_transition)
net.transitions.add(ca_transition)
net.transitions.add(ap_transition)
net.transitions.add(p_transition)
net.transitions.add(n_transition)

# Now, add arcs

# Start -> CR
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start_place, cr_transition, net)

# CR -> DV
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr_transition, dv_place, net)

# DV -> RDS
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv_place, rds_transition, net)

# DV -> FC
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv_place, fc_transition, net)

# RDS -> DV
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds_transition, dv_place, net)

# FC -> II
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_transition, ii_transition, net)

# FC -> CA
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_transition, ca_transition, net)

# II -> FC
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii_transition, fc_transition, net)

# CA -> AP
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca_transition, ap_transition, net)

# AP -> P
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap_transition, p_transition, net)

# P -> N
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_transition, n_transition, net)

# N -> CL
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n_transition, cl_place, net)

# Now, initial and final markings

im = Marking()
im[start_place] = 1  # initial token in Start

fm = Marking()
fm[cl_place] = 1  # final token in CL

Wait, but in the example given in the prompt, the final marking is a place, and in that example, the code removes the sink place. But in this case, the final place is CL, so the final marking is that.

But wait, in the example, the user had to remove the sink place. But in our case, the CL is a place that's supposed to be the final state. So in our code, the final marking has a token in CL.

But the code as written would have the initial marking with Start:1, and the final with CL:1.

But in the example, the final marking is the final state. So the code is correct.

But wait, in the example, the sink was removed, but in our case, the CL is a place that's not removed. So the code is okay.

But in the example, the sink is a place that's removed, but in our case, the CL is a place that's kept. So the code is correct.

But I need to check if the arcs are correct. For example, the N transition leads to CL place. So when N is fired, it moves the token to CL.

But in the example, the final marking is the final state, so CL is the final place.

So the code should be correct.

But wait, in the example, the initial marking is the initial state, which is the start place. The final marking is the final state, which is the CL place.

But in the example, the sink place was removed, but in our code, the CL is a place that's kept. So the code is correct.

But I need to make sure that all the arcs are correctly added. For example, the RDS transition is a transition that leads to the DV place. So when RDS is fired, it moves the token from the DV place to the RDS transition? Wait, no. Wait, the arcs are added as:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source, transition, net)

So, for example, the arc from DV place to RDS transition is added. So when the token is in DV place, and the RDS transition is fired, it moves the token to the next place.

Wait, no. Wait, the Petri net has places and transitions. A transition can have incoming and outgoing arcs. The arc from a place to a transition is an input arc, and the arc from a transition to a place is an output arc.

So, when a transition is fired, it consumes tokens from its input places and produces tokens in its output places.

So, in our case, the arc from DV place to RDS transition is an input arc for RDS. So when RDS is fired, it consumes a token from DV (the input place), and then the output arcs from RDS to DV place (if any) would be output arcs.

Wait, no. Wait, the RDS transition has an output arc to DV place. So when RDS is fired, the token is moved from the input place (DV) to the output place (DV again?), but that seems odd.

Wait, the arc from DV place to RDS transition is an input arc. The arc from RDS transition to DV place is an output arc.

So, when the RDS transition is fired, it consumes a token from DV place (input) and produces a token in DV place again (output). That would mean that the token is "reused" in the DV place. So, this is a loop.

But that's correct for the scenario where after RDS, the process loops back to DV again.

Similarly, for the FC to II and II to FC.

But the code as written adds:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv_place, rds_transition, net)  this is an input arc for RDS.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds_transition, dv_place, net)  this is an output arc for RDS.

So when RDS is fired, the token is moved from DV to DV again. So that's correct.

But how does that work with the Petri net? Because the transition RDS has an input arc from DV and an output arc to DV. So when the transition is fired, it consumes a token from DV (the input) and produces a token in DV (the output). So the token is not consumed, but moved back to the same place. So that's a loop.

But in reality, the RDS is a step that requires re-submission of documents. So after RDS is done, the process returns to DV again. So this seems correct.

Similarly, the FC transition has an input arc from DV (or from where?), and the II transition is an output arc from FC, and then II has an output arc back to FC.

So the code seems correct.

Another thing: the initial marking has a token in the Start place, and the final marking has a token in the CL place.

But in the Petri net, the initial marking is the initial state. So the Start place has a token, and the CL place is the final state.

But in the code, the final marking is fm[cl_place] = 1. But in the Petri net, the CL place is a place that is supposed to be the final state. So when the process reaches CL, the marking is done.

But in the code, the initial marking is Start:1, and the final is CL:1. So the code is correct.

Wait, but in the example given in the prompt, the final marking is the final state, and the code removes the sink place. But in our case, the CL is a place that's kept. So the code is correct.

Now, I need to make sure that all the transitions are correctly connected. Let me check again.

CR transition is connected to DV place. So when CR is fired, the token moves from Start to DV.

DV place has two transitions: RDS and FC.

RDS transition is connected to DV place (output), so when RDS is fired, it consumes a token from DV and produces a token in DV again.

FC transition is connected to DV place (input), so when FC is fired, it consumes a token from DV and produces a token in FC's output.

Wait, no. The FC transition is connected to DV place as input, and then FC's output is connected to II and CA.

So the code adds:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv_place, fc_transition, net)  this is an input arc for fc_transition.

Then, petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_transition, ii_transition, net)  output arc from fc to ii.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_transition, ca_transition, net)  output arc from fc to ca.

Then, petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii_transition, fc_transition, net)  output arc from ii to fc.

So when the FC is fired, it consumes a token from DV (input), and produces tokens in ii and ca. But wait, the FC transition is a transition that has two output arcs. So when the FC is fired, it has to consume a token from its input (DV place), and then produce tokens in the output places (ii and ca). But in the code, the FC transition is connected to the ii and ca transitions. So that's correct.

Wait, no. Because the output arcs are from the transition to the next place. For example, the arc from FC transition to II transition. So the output of FC is the II transition. So when FC is fired, the token is moved from the input place (DV) to the output transition (II). But that's not correct. Because transitions are fired, and they have output arcs to places.

Wait, no. The transitions are connected to places. So, for example, the FC transition has output arcs to II and CA transitions? Or to places?

Wait, the transitions are the steps, and the places are the states. So, the arc from FC transition to II transition is not correct. Because the output of a transition must be to a place. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, this is a critical point. In a Petri net, transitions are connected to places via arcs. So the output arcs of a transition are to places. So the FC transition has output arcs to II and CA transitions? No. That's not correct. The transitions are steps, and the output arcs of a transition should be to places. So the code I wrote earlier may have a mistake here.

Wait, in the code, the FC transition is connected to II and CA transitions. But that's not correct. Because transitions are not places. The output of a transition must be to a place. So the code has a mistake here.

Ah! That's a big mistake. Because the transitions are steps, and the output arcs of a transition should be to places. So the code I wrote earlier is wrong. For example, in the code:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_transition, ii_transition, net)

This is adding an arc from the FC transition to the II transition. But that's not correct. Because the output of a transition must be to a place, not to another transition. So this is incorrect.

So this is a critical error. How to correct this.

Let me think again. The FC transition is a step that leads to the II and CA steps. But in a Petri net, transitions are connected to places. So after FC is fired, the token moves to the next place.

Wait, perhaps the FC transition is connected to a place that represents the next step. But in the scenario, after FC, there's II and CA. So perhaps the FC transition is connected to a place that is the start of the II and CA steps.

Alternatively, the FC transition is connected to a place that has two transitions: one for II and one for CA.

But that's not the case. So perhaps I need to re-express the transitions and places.

Let me re-express the steps.

The FC transition is a step that leads to either II or CA. So after FC is fired, the token moves to a place that can trigger either II or CA transitions.

But that's not possible with the current structure. So maybe I need to model the FC transition as leading to a place that has two outgoing arcs to transitions: II and CA.

But that would require a place that is connected to both transitions.

Alternatively, the FC transition can have two output arcs to two different places. But that's not the case. Because the FC is a single step that can lead to either II or CA.

So, the correct way is to have the FC transition's output arc to a place that is the start of the II and CA steps. But that's not possible, unless we have a place that is connected to both transitions.

Alternatively, the FC transition has two output arcs to two different places. But that would not be correct, because the FC transition is a single step that can lead to either II or CA.

Wait, maybe the FC transition is connected to a place called 'FC_out', which has two transitions: II and CA.

But that would complicate the model.

Alternatively, the model can have the FC transition leading to a place, which then has two transitions: one to II, one to CA.

But that would be a structure where after FC, you go to a place that has two transitions.

But that's a possible approach.

So, for example:

After FC is fired, the token moves to a place called 'FC_out', which has two transitions: II and CA.

So the code would need to:

- Add a place called 'FC_out'.

- Add a transition called 'II' and 'CA'.

- Add arcs from FC to FC_out.

- Add arcs from FC_out to II and CA.

But this would make the model more complex, but it's correct.

But given the time constraints, perhaps I should adjust the code to model this correctly.

So, in the scenario, after FC is fired, the process can go to II (in-depth investigation) or to CA (claim assessment). So the FC transition is connected to a place that allows for branching.

So, the correct way to model this is:

- FC transition is connected to a place called 'FC_out'.

- 'FC_out' has two outgoing arcs to II and CA transitions.

But that would require adding a new place.

So, let's adjust the code:

Add a new place called 'FC_out'.

Then, the FC transition is connected to FC_out.

Then, FC_out has two output arcs: to II and CA transitions.

But then, the II transition is connected to a place called 'FC' again (to allow for multiple loops), and the CA transition is connected to the next steps.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the FC transition has an output arc to a place called 'FC_out', which has two transitions: II and CA. But that would require that the 'FC_out' place is connected to both transitions.

But in that case, the code would need to:

- Add a new place called 'FC_out'.

- Add transitions 'II' and 'CA'.

- Add arcs from FC to FC_out.

- Add arcs from FC_out to II and CA.

But then, the II transition has an output arc to FC again.

So the code would be:

After FC is fired, the token moves to FC_out. Then, when the II is fired, the token moves to FC again.

But that would require that the II transition has an output arc to FC.

So the code would be:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_transition, fc_out_place, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_out_place, ii_transition, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_out_place, ca_transition, net)

Then, the II transition is connected to a place called 'FC' again, so:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii_transition, fc_transition, net)

But that would allow for multiple loops.

But this requires adding a new place, 'FC_out'.

But in the original code, I didn't have that. So this is a mistake in the previous code.

So, this is a critical mistake. The original code had the FC transition connected to II and CA transitions, which is incorrect.

So, to correct this, I need to add a new place, 'FC_out', and connect the FC transition to it, and then connect FC_out to II and CA.

So, let's adjust the code accordingly.

So, the code will have:

# Places
fc_out_place = PetriNet.Place(name="FC_out")

Then, the transitions:

fc_transition is connected to fc_out_place.

Then, fc_out_place is connected to ii and ca transitions.

So, the code would be:

# Add FC_out place
fc_out_place = PetriNet.Place(name="FC_out")
net.places.add(fc_out_place)

# Add arcs from FC to FC_out
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_transition, fc_out_place, net)

# Add arcs from FC_out to II and CA
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_out_place, ii_transition, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_out_place, ca_transition, net)

Then, the II transition is connected to FC again:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii_transition, fc_transition, net)

This way, the FC transition leads to FC_out, which then leads to II or CA. The II leads back to FC.

This is correct.

Similarly, for the RDS transition, which leads back to DV.

So, with this correction, the previous code is wrong, and I need to adjust it.

This is a big change, but necessary.

So, the code would now have:

Places:

Start, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL, FC_out.

Transitions: CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N.

But wait, the FC_out is a place, not a transition.

So the code would now have:

After adding the FC_out place, the transitions are:

CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N.

So, the code for the arcs would be:

# FC transition is connected to FC_out place
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_transition, fc_out_place, net)

# FC_out place is connected to II and CA transitions
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_out_place, ii_transition, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_out_place, ca_transition, net)

# II transition is connected to FC
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii_transition, fc_transition, net)

This would allow the FC to loop to II, which loops back to FC.

This is the correct way to model the branching.

So, this is a significant change from the initial code, which had the FC transition connected to II and CA transitions directly.

So, with this correction, the code should now be correct.

Now, the other arcs are:

CR -> DV.

DV -> RDS and DV -> FC.

RDS -> DV.

FC -> FC_out.

FC_out -> II and CA.

II -> FC.

CA -> AP.

AP -> P.

P -> N.

N -> CL.

So, the code would now be:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet(name="InsuranceClaimProcess")

# Places

# Initial and final markings
im = Marking()
im[start_place] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[cl_place] = 1

This should now correctly model the scenario.

But wait, in the code above, the FC_out_place is a place, and the code adds arcs from fc_transition to fc_out_place, and from fc_out_place to ii and ca transitions.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the code should have all the necessary arcs and places.

But I need to make sure that all the transitions and places are correctly added.

Another thing to check: the initial marking has a token in Start, and the final marking has a token in CL.

So the code is correct.

I think this should now be the correct code.

### Explanation:

1. **Petri Net Structure:**
   - **Places:** Represent states in the process (e.g., Start, DV, RDS, FC_out, II, CL).
   - **Transitions:** Represent activities (e.g., CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N).

2. **Arcs:**
   - **Start  CR:** The process begins with a token in the Start place.
   - **CR  DV:** The Claim Registration transition leads to the Document Verification place.
   - **DV  RDS and DV  FC:** Document Verification can lead to Re-Document Submission or Fraud Check.
   - **RDS  DV:** Re-Document Submission loops back to DV for re-verification.
   - **FC  FC_out:** Fraud Check leads to a place that allows branching.
   - **FC_out  II and CA:** After Fraud Check, the process branches to In-depth Investigation or Claim Assessment.
   - **II  FC:** In-depth Investigation loops back to Fraud Check for potential re-evaluation.
   - **CA  AP  P  N  CL:** The process flows through Approval, Payment, Notification, and finally to Closure.

3. **Initial and Final Markings:**
   - **Initial Marking (im):** A token is placed in the Start place.
   - **Final Marking (fm):** A token is placed in the CL (Closure) place, representing the end of the process.

This Petri net correctly models the insurance claim process with loops and branching, ensuring that all possible paths are represented logically.
