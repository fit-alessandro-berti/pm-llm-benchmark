Here’s the assessment case by case, based on the intended rules:

Normative flows (from the description):

- **Fulfillment scenario (sufficient inventory):**  
  Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

- **Cancellation scenario (insufficient inventory):**  
  Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

Key constraints:

- Check inventory must happen after Receive and **before** any payment or fulfillment decision.
- Authorize payment: only **after** Check inventory and **before** Package.
- Package items: only **after** Authorize payment and **before** Ship.
- Ship order: only **after** Package and **never after Cancel**.
- Close order: final activity in all scenarios.

### Case 1

Sequence:  
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

- Fully matches the “sufficient inventory” scenario.
- All ordering constraints are respected.

**Verdict:** Conformant (no violations).

---

### Case 2

Sequence:  
Receive  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

Violations:

1. **Packaging before payment authorization**  
   - Norm: *“Authorize payment should … occur … before packaging”* and *“Package items should only occur after authorization”*.  
   - Here: Package items happens **before** Authorize payment.

2. **Shipment after incorrectly ordered packaging/payment**  
   - While Ship order comes after Package (which is structurally correct), the packaging itself was not preceded by authorization, so the precondition for legitimate shipping is broken.

**Verdict:** Non-conformant (violates payment-before-packaging rule).

---

### Case 3

Sequence:  
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

Violations:

1. **Shipping after cancellation**  
   - Norm: *“Ship order should … never [occur] after a cancellation.”*  
   - Here: Ship order occurs **after** Cancel order.

2. **Cancellation path semantics**  
   - In the cancellation scenario, after Check inventory reveals insufficient stock, the process should go directly to Cancel order, then Close order.  
   - While Authorize payment before cancellation is not explicitly forbidden, it is inconsistent with the described intent: in the “insufficient inventory” branch, no fulfillment activities (including payment for fulfillment) should follow. Still, the **clear, explicit violation** is shipping after cancel.

**Verdict:** Non-conformant (violates “no shipping after cancellation”).

---

### Case 4

Sequence:  
Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

- Exactly matches the cancellation scenario:
  - Check inventory occurs right after Receive.
  - Insufficient inventory branch: Cancel order, then Close order.
  - No packaging, shipping, or payment after cancellation.

**Verdict:** Conformant (no violations).

---

### Case 5

Sequence:  
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

Violations:

1. **Shipping without packaging**  
   - Norm: *“Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped.”*  
   - Here: there is **no** Package items activity at all before Ship order.  
   - Thus Ship order occurs without the required packaging step.

**Verdict:** Non-conformant (missing mandatory “Package items” before shipping).

---

### Summary

- **Conformant cases:** 1, 4  
- **Non-conformant cases:**  
  - **Case 2:** Package before Authorize payment.  
  - **Case 3:** Ship after Cancel order.  
  - **Case 5:** Ship without prior Package items.
