Practical “journey” triggered by the model  

1. Real-life trigger  
   Programme-wise the process can only begin with **Receive_Application (A)** (init, existence).  A loan officer or an online portal creates a case in the workflow engine; from that moment onward **Proceed_Without_Compliance (Z)** is forbidden (absence) – i.e. no shortcut buttons appear in the UI and the back-end proactively blocks any API calls tagged as “skip-compliance”.

2. First screening  
   The **response** rule tells the engine: “Whenever A occurs, B must eventually occur.”  
   Concretely: as soon as the system registers an application, a task with SLA “B=Preliminary_Credit_Check required within 1 working day” is created and assigned to the underwriting queue.  Because **exactly_one** is enforced, only one internal credit bureau call is allowed; the process will lock the “run credit check” button permanently after the result is stored.  This prevents multiple (possibly inconsistent) lookups – a frequent source of complaints to the national credit authority.

3. Clamping together the paperwork  
   Once the bureau check is finished, the **succession (chain)** “B  C” combines a precedence with a response, forcing the underwriting team to switch logically to **Gather_Additional_Documents (C)**.  The rule “must once be executed” (existence) means that zero-doc approval paths are impossible – again closing a compliance loophole that plagued past audits.

4. Quality gate, not a rubber stamp  
   **Altsuccession C  E**, **Precedence E  F** and **Chainsuccession E  D** form a mini-loop that encodes a real-world hand-off:  
   • No offer package may be assembled (D) until QA (E) is signed off.  
   • QA itself can only happen after the document-gathering stage is complete (otherwise reviewers could not see any files).  
   • The loop is “alt”-flavoured: QA and packaging may be repeated if a discrepancy is found, but they must always remain adjacent.  In operational terms, the BPM tool will not allowmanually skipping the QA task (no out-of-order execution) and the case progresses to contract-authorisation only after the QA outcome is “pass”.

5. Final contracting & payout  
   **Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package (D)** then triggers **Transfer_Funds (G)–Notify_Customer (H)** via two consecutive chain rules:  
   • **Chainresponse (DG)** guarantees an internal workflow task “generate payout file to treasury system” is created when the package status is switched to “approved”.  
   • **Altresponse GH** makes sure the notification job is placed on top of the queue immediately after disbursement.  An automatic SMS / e-mail is scheduled before the case moves out of the “open” state.  

   Two negative constraints act as safety catches:  
   • **Noncoexistence (G,A)** stops accidentaldouble initiation – once funds have been sent, the “receive new application” wizard is greyed out for that account.  
   • **Nonchainsuccession (FH)** prevents the notification task from ever running in strict sequence after contract authorisation (F).  Practically that means “send the offer only after QA and packaging, not after you merely sign the authorisation page”.

Business rationale behind the rules  
• Regulators (e.g. consumer-protection, anti-money-laundering directives) require a single, documented, unrepeatable credit check and strict document evidence before disbursement.  
• Internal risk appetite demands a costly QA step on every retail loan; removing that possibility (exactly-once/chain rules) shrinks the tail risk of erroneous approvals.  
• Investor confidence in securitised loan books improves when each loan has the same audit trail: “received-investigated-packaged-reviewed-authorised-sent-notified”.  
• Customers gain transparency: no secretive “settlement” without notification, and a clear timeline anchored by compulsory sequential milestones.

Side effects the model prevents  
• Bypassing document collection because the customer is “known”.  
• Running two or three separate preliminary checks and picking the most favourable result.  
• Disbursing funds before an authorised contract (illegal in many jurisdictions).  
• Sending generic “decision made” messages without disclosing the approved loan structure.

In short, the DECLARE specification is a formally encoded loan playbook.  Instead of relying on lengthy human-readable policies and training sessions, the workflow engine enforces policy mechanically, thereby achieving regulatory compliance, consistent quality and uniform customer experience.
