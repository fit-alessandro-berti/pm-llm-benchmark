After analyzing the process variants of both the protected and unprotected groups, I have identified some potential unfair differences in treatment. These differences are based on my domain knowledge of process analysis and loan application procedures.

**1. Rejection rates:** The protected group has a higher rejection rate for loan applications. For example, the process variant "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Application Rejected" has a frequency of 960 in the protected group, whereas the corresponding variant in the unprotected group has a frequency of 664. This suggests that the protected group is more likely to be rejected at an earlier stage of the application process.

**2. Co-signer requirements:** The protected group is more likely to be required to have a co-signer for the loan. For example, the process variant "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" has a frequency of 138 in the protected group, whereas the corresponding variant in the unprotected group has a frequency of 335. This suggests that the protected group may be subject to stricter credit requirements.

**3. Collateral assessment:** The protected group is more likely to have their collateral assessed multiple times. For example, the process variant "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" has a frequency of 40 in the protected group, whereas the corresponding variant in the unprotected group has a frequency of 23. This suggests that the protected group may be subject to more stringent collateral evaluation procedures.

**4. Approval rates:** The unprotected group has a higher approval rate for loan applications. For example, the process variant "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" has a frequency of 1656 in the unprotected group, whereas the corresponding variant in the protected group has a frequency of 31. This suggests that the unprotected group is more likely to be approved for a loan.

**5. Skipped examination:** The unprotected group has a process variant "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement" with a frequency of 332, which is not present in the protected group. This suggests that the
