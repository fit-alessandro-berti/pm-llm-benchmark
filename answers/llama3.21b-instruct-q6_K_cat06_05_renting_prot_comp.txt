Based on the process variants reported, I've identified several unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group (first) and the 'unprotected' group (second). Here are the key disparities:

1. **Extension of Screening Process**: The protected group's application is extensively screened for 6 steps (Screening Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening), while the unprotected group's process involves only 2 steps (Screening Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant).
2. **Multiple Steps to Reject Prospective Tenant**: In the unprotected group, rejecting a prospective tenant requires multiple steps: Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant. This results in an additional 4-5 iterations of processing compared to the protected group.
3. **Multiple Steps for Sign Contract and Move-In**: In both groups, signing a contract (Sign Contract) and moving in (Move In) require multiple steps: Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In. This adds to the overall processing time.
4. **Longer Processing Times for Unprotected Group**: Many processes take longer for the unprotected group, indicating that there are more iterations of processing involved, which can lead to delays and increased costs.

In terms of performance metrics:

1. **Performance Difference by Step Complexity**: The protected group's process has higher average performance (270,000.477 vs 540,011.977) due to fewer steps in the screening process.
2. **Average Processing Time**: The protected group experiences longer processing times (108,001.15 seconds vs 118,995.63 seconds) compared to the unprotected group.

These disparities highlight potential inefficiencies and areas for optimization within both groups' processes, allowing for more streamlined and cost-effective execution of property viewings and tenant screening.
