## Process Mining Event Log

Here is the integrated event log derived from the provided tables, using `order_id` as the case identifier.

**Assumptions Made:**

1.  **Items Picked Event:** For the "Items Picked" event, a single event is created per order. The timestamp used is the *latest* `item_picking_date` among all line items for that order. The resources listed are all `picker_id`s involved in picking items for that order. The items and quantities picked are included as an attribute. This summarizes the picking activity for the whole order rather than generating an event per item line pick.
2.  **Delivery Events:** Each delivery record (`delivery_id`) generates two distinct events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived", using their respective timestamps and the carrier as the resource. The delivery ID is included in the activity name for clarity.
3.  **Invoice Events:** Each invoice record (`invoice_id`) generates an "Invoice Issued" event, using the issue date and the billing person as the resource. The invoice ID is included in the activity name.
4.  **Payment Events:** Each payment record (`payment_id`) generates a "Payment Received" event, using the payment date. The resource is assumed to be the `billing_person_id` associated with the linked invoice, as no separate payment processor resource is provided. The payment ID is included in the activity name.
5.  **Incomplete Data (Order 1004):** Order 1004 appears to have been created and picked but has no associated delivery, invoice, or payment records in the provided data. The log includes the events that *did* occur for this order based on the available data.
6.  **Resource Mapping:** Resource IDs (SP-xxx, WH-xxx, CR-xx, BL-xxx) are mapped to resource names using the `Resources` table.

| Case ID | Activity Name                    | Timestamp             | Resource                     | Other Attributes                                                                 |
