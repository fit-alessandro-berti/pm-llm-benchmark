### Part 1: Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules)

**Case Analysis for Compliance with Strict Sequence & Constraints**

#### Case 1
- **Compliance Verification:**  
  - The sequence follows exactly as required: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation (since approved)  Close Case.  
  - No ordering violations occur; each step happens in the correct order and no contradictory actions are performed.

#### Case 2
- **Violation Analysis:**  
  - **Credit Check Missing Precedence Violation:** The risk assessment is conducted before a credit check, which violates the normative rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment. This results in an out-of-sequence process.
  - **Finalize Documentation Incorrect Timing Violation:** After a loan rejection, documentation should not be finalized before closing the case. However, this step was carried out, which is explicitly forbidden by the strict rules.

#### Case 3
- **Partial Compliance with Normative Rules:**  
  - The strict sequence is respected for most steps: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
  - However, there are timing deviations:
    - **Credit Check Timing Violation:** Completed more than 24 hours after the application was received. While this does not technically violate a rule, it is against best practice recommendations and can be considered a desideratum violation.
    - **Inform Applicant Timing Violation:** Not informed within 48 hours of the loan decision (it happened nearly two days later). This is another desiderative concern but not normative.

**Conclusion for Part 1:**
- Cases that strictly adhere to all rules are compliant (Case 1, with minor timing considerations in Case 3).
- Cases violating any rule, like Case 2 where the sequence is disrupted and a final step occurs improperly after rejection, should be flagged as non-compliant.

### Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)

**Case Analysis for Recommended Practices**

#### Case 1
- **Compliance Verification:**  
  - No desideratum violations were observed. All steps occurred within recommended timeframes.
  - The follow-up call was performed promptly before closing the case.

#### Case 2
- **Desiderata Violations Identified:**  
  - **Credit Check Timing:** Completed after more than a day, violating the “within 24 hours” recommendation.
  - **Inform Applicant Timing:** Not within 48 hours of decision; this is also a desiderative breach but still acceptable without being critical.

#### Case 3
- **Desiderata Compliance & Violations:**  
  - **Credit Check Timing Compliance:** Completed after the recommended window, so it's compliant with timing best practices.
  - **Inform Applicant Timing:** Not done within 48 hours; this is a desiderative violation but not severe enough to classify as non-compliance.
  - **Follow-up Call Missing:** The absence of a follow-up call does not break the process rules and represents only a suboptimal behavior rather than a failure.

**Conclusion for Part 2:**
- Cases (Case 1) fully meet both normative constraints and desiderata recommendations, indicating optimal performance.
- Case 2 breaches some timing-related desiderata but remains compliant with the strict normative process.  
- Case 3 is generally compliant except for one desiderative aspect (the absence of a follow-up call), which does not affect compliance.

### Summary
1. **Violations in Normative Process:** Cases that have improper sequencing or order, such as performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check and Finalizing Documentation after rejection.
2. **Desiderata Violations:** Timing deviations like delayed credit checks or informing applicants later than recommended do not invalidate the process but should be addressed for efficiency improvement.

In both scenarios, adherence to strict norms is crucial; however, understanding desiderata can help in optimizing operational performance without compromising compliance rules.
