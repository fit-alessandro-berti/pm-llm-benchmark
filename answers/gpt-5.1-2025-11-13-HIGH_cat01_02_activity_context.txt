1. Activities that recur within the same case and how their meaning changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------  

**Case C001**

- **Verify Documents (09:20)**  
  - Context: First identity check right after request submission.  
  - Meaning: Initial back-office document verification.
- **Verify Documents (10:30)**  
  - Context: Happens after customer submitted missing ID scan.  
  - Meaning: Re-verification to complete/confirm documents after additional material is received.

**Case C002**

- **Call Customer (09:00)**  
  - Context: Outbound call to clarify an account discrepancy before any internal adjustment.  
  - Meaning: Initial clarification call.
- **Call Customer (09:50)**  
  - Context: Occurs after “Adjust Account”; purpose is to confirm changes.  
  - Meaning: Follow-up confirmation call.

**Case C003**

- **Verify Documents (11:25)**  
  - Context: Physical check of ID right after a walkin request.  
  - Meaning: Initial in-branch document verification.
- **Verify Documents (12:20)**

3. Justification of naming choices
----------------------------------  

**Verify Documents  several contextual variants**

- **Initial Document Verification (Back Office)**  
  - Used in C001 (09:20) and C002 (08:15).  
  - Clues: early position in the case, immediately after request initiation; resource is *BackOfficeAgent*; context mentions “checks identity documents” / “Identity verification”.  
  - Purpose: first-pass digital ID check.

- **Initial In-Branch Document Verification**  
  - Used in C003 (11:25).  
  - Clues: resource is *BranchOfficer*; context explicitly says “Physical verification of ID”; occurs immediately after a walk-in request.  
  - Purpose: first-pass physical ID check at the branch.

- **Document Re-Verification after Additional Documents**  
  - Used in C001 (10:30).  
  - Clues: comes after “Submit Additional Documents”; context says “re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided”.  
  - Purpose: completing verification after missing documentation is supplied.

- **Document Re-Verification after Account Adjustment**  
  - Used in C003 (12:20).  
  - Clues: occurs after “Adjust Account Details due to Missing Info”; context says “Re-verify docs after account adjustment”.  
  - Purpose: ensuring documents and corrected account data are consistent.

**Call Customer  several contextual variants**

- **Call Customer to Request Missing Documents**  
  - C001 (09:45).  
  - Clues: context explicitly “calls to request missing docs”; positioned between two document checks.  
  - Purpose: gather missing documentation.

- **Call Customer to Clarify Account Discrepancy**  
  - C002 (09:00).  
  - Clues: context “clarify account discrepancy”; occurs before any adjustment.  
  - Purpose: clarify information to enable internal correction.

- **Call Customer to Confirm Account Adjustments**  
  - C002 (09:50).  
  - Clues: context “confirm adjustments made”; occurs after “Adjust Account”.  
  - Purpose: confirmation/follow-up contact.

- **Call Customer to Return to Branch**  
  - C003 (11:50).  
  - Clues: context “customer stepped out… calls to have them return”; branch setting.  
  - Purpose: operational recall, not information gathering.

**Other renamed activities (for clarity in flow, even if not repeated in-case)**

- **Submit Request via Web Portal** vs **Initiate Request at Branch Reception**  
  - Distinguishes online versus in-branch initiation; clues from *Resource* and context (WebPortal vs BranchReception, walk-in).

- **Submit Additional Documents via Self-Service**  
  - Makes clear that what is submitted are documents and that it is done by the customer through self-service.

- **Adjust Account Details after Clarification / due to Missing Info**  
  - Captures why the adjustment occurred (after clarification vs missing info).

- **Approve Request – Final Decision**  
  - Explicitly labels this as the final approval step in the workflow, matching the “Final approval given” context.
