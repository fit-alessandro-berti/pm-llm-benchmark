Below is a **single POWL model** that captures the behavior in the log (repeated IQC checks, reassembly, optional labeling, retesting loop, etc.).  
It is written in POWL notation / Pythonstyle structure but **no code needs to be run**.

##  Final POWL Structure

### **Transitions**
```
OR, MS, QS, AS, IQC, TST, RT, PK, LB, DP, D
  (silent)
```

### **Submodels**

**(1) IQC can repeat before reassembly**
```
IQC_loop = * ( IQC ,  )
```
This produces: IQC, IQC IQC, IQC IQC IQC, … (one or more IQCs)

**(2) Assembly with possible IQC and reassembly**
```
Assembly_loop = * ( AS , IQC_loop )
```
This yields:  
AS  
AS IQC AS  
AS IQC IQC AS IQC AS  
… (matches cases 1,2,3,5, and case 4 skips IQC completely)

**(3) Testing with possible retesting**
```
Test_loop = * ( TST , RT )
```
Produces: TST  
TST RT TST  
TST RT TST RT TST  
… (matches cases 1,3,5)

**(4) Optional labeling**
```
Label_choice = X ( LB ,  )
```

##  Root Partial Order

```
PO = (
  nodes = {
    OR, MS, QS,
    Assembly_loop,
    Test_loop,
    PK,
    Label_choice,
    DP, D
  },
  order = {
    OR  --> MS,
    MS  --> QS,
    QS  --> Assembly_loop,
    Assembly_loop --> Test_loop,
    Test_loop --> PK,
    PK  --> Label_choice,
    Label_choice --> DP,
    DP  --> D
  }
)
```

###  Compact POWL Summary
```
PO = (
  nodes = { OR, MS, QS,
            * ( AS, * ( IQC,  ) ),
            * ( TST, RT ),
            PK,
            X ( LB,  ),
            DP, D },
  order = { ORMS, MSQS, QS*(AS,*(IQC,)),
            *(AS,*(IQC,))*(TST,RT),
            *(TST,RT)PK, PKX(LB,),
            X(LB,)DP, DPD }
)
```

This POWL model exactly reflects:

 repeated IQCs  
 optional IQC skipping  
 reassembly cycles  
 retesting loop  
 optional labeling  
 strict sequential flow for the rest of the process
