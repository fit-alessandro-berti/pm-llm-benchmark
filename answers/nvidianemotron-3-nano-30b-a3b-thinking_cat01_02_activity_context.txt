We need to output revised event log with renamed activities, plus brief justification. Must follow constraints? Not specified. Provide naming changes for each recurring activity across cases: "Verify Documents", "Call Customer", "Adjust Account"? Actually "Adjust Account" appears only in C002 and C003. Also "Verify Documents" appears multiple times in each case. "Call Customer" appears multiple times in C001 and C002 and C003. So rename each occurrence per context.

We need to rename activities to reflect context: maybe "Initiate Request" stays same, "Verify Documents - Initial", "Call Customer - First Verification Follow-up", "Submit Additional", "Verify Documents - Recheck", "Approve Request" stays same, "Adjust Account" maybe stays same but could differentiate "Adjust Account - Post Call", "Call Customer - Follow-up". Also "Adjust Account" appears after call; could rename to "Adjust Account - Internal Update".

Also "Submit Additional" appears once; keep.

We need to present revised log with new names.

Also brief justification for each rename.

Let's craft answer.

We'll list revised table for each case.

Rename mapping:

- Verify Documents (first occurrence) -> "Verify Documents - Initial Check"
- Verify Documents (second occurrence after additional docs) -> "Verify Documents - Recheck"
- Call Customer (first occurrence after verification incomplete) -> "Call Customer - Request Missing Docs"
- Call Customer (second occurrence after adjustment) -> "Call Customer - Followup Confirmation"
- Adjust Account -> maybe keep "Adjust Account - Internal Update" to differentiate from any other adjust? Only appears once per case but could still rename to "Adjust Account - PostCall Update"

- Submit Additional remains "Submit Additional Docs"

- Approve Request stays "Approve Request"

- Initiate Request stays "Initiate Request"

- Additional Context column maybe keep.

Let's produce revised log.

Will include justification bullet points.

Proceed.

### 1.Observations  

| Activity (asis) | How many times it appears in a case | What differs between the occurrences |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Verify Documents** | 2× per case (except C001 where it appears 3×) | – First call checks the original set of documents. <br>– Later call checks the same set **after** the customer has uploaded additional material or after an internal adjustment has been made. |
| **Call Customer** | 2× (C001 & C002) or 1× (C003) but appears at different stages | – First call is a **request for missing documentation**. <br>– A second call (or the only call in C003) is a **reminder / confirmation** after some work has been done. |
| **Adjust Account** | 1× (C002, C003) | – Performed **after** a call and before the final verification, reflecting an internal change to the customer’s account. |
| **Submit Additional** | 1× (only in C001) | – A distinct step where the customer uploads the missing document. |

Because the same textual label is used for activities that have **different functional meanings**, we need contextspecific names that make the process flow selfexplanatory.

### 2.Proposed Renamings  

| Original label | New contextual label | Rationale (key contextual cue) |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Verify Documents | **Verify Documents – Initial Check** | First verification of the original identity documents. |
| Verify Documents (later) | **Verify Documents – Recheck** | Verification occurs **after** the customer supplies additional material or after an account adjustment. |
| Call Customer (first) | **Call Customer – Request Missing Docs** | Agent calls **to obtain** the missing document(s). |
| Call Customer (later) | **Call Customer – Followup Confirmation** | Call is made **to confirm** that a previously requested action (e.g., document upload) has been completed. |
| Adjust Account | **Adjust Account – Internal Update** | Internal modification of the customer’s record **after** a call, before the final verification. |
| Submit Additional | **Submit Additional Docs** | Customer uploads the *additional* document that was requested. |
| Approve Request | **Approve Request** | No change – this activity always denotes the final approval step. |
| Initiate Request | **Initiate Request** | No change – the entry point of every case. |

### 4.Justification Summary  

* **Verify Documents – Initial Check** vs. **Verify Documents – Recheck** – The first verification occurs before any customersupplied supplement; the second happens **after** the supplemental document (or after an internal adjustment) is available, indicating a revalidation step.  
* **Call Customer – Request Missing Docs** vs. **Call Customer – Followup Confirmation** – The first call is purposeful **to obtain** something that is missing; the later call merely **confirms** that a previously requested action has been completed.  
* **Adjust Account – Internal Update** – The activity modifies the system record **after** a call and **before** the final verification, so the “internal update” qualifier makes its purpose explicit.  
* **Submit Additional Docs** – Adding “Docs” clarifies that the customer is uploading *additional* documentation, not the original request.  
* The remaining activity names (**Initiate Request**, **Approve Request**) are unique enough to stay unchanged.

These renamed activities preserve the original chronological order while making the **contextual role** of each step immediately apparent to any reader of the log.
