# The 'net', 'im', and 'fm' variables now hold the accepting Petri net.
# You can visualize it using pm4py.visualization.petri_net.visualizer if desired:

# gviz = pn_visualizer.apply(net, im, fm)
# pn_visualizer.view(gviz) # Opens a window with the visualization
# pn_visualizer.save(gviz, "insurance_claim_petri_net.png") # Saves the visualization
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:** A `PetriNet` object named "InsuranceClaimManagement" is created.
2.  **Places:** `PetriNet.Place` objects are created for each significant state in the process (e.g., `p_start`, `p_registered`, `p_docs_verified`, `p_closed`). Helper places (`intermediate_place_dv`, `intermediate_place_fc`) are added to correctly model the decision points after DV and FC.
3.  **Transitions:** `PetriNet.Transition` objects represent the activities. Labels are provided for clarity (e.g., "Claim Registration" for `t_cr`). Silent transitions (with `label=None`) like `t_dv_ok`, `t_dv_nok`, `t_fc_ok`, `t_fc_nok`, `t_approval_needed`, `t_approval_not_needed` are used to model the branching logic (choices) after Document Verification, Fraud Check, and Claim Assessment without representing an explicit business activity.
4.  **Arcs:** `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to()` connects the places and transitions to define the sequence and loops:
    *   The main sequence follows the described steps.
    *   **Document Verification Choice:** `t_dv` leads to an intermediate place. From there, either `t_dv_ok` fires (leading to `p_docs_verified`) or `t_dv_nok` fires (leading to `p_docs_incomplete`).
    *   **Re-Document Submission Loop:** `p_docs_incomplete` leads to `t_rds`, which loops back to `p_registered` to start the verification process again.
    *   **Fraud Check Choice:** `t_fc` leads to an intermediate place. From there, either `t_fc_ok` fires (leading to `p_fraud_checked`) or `t_fc_nok` fires (leading to `p_investigation_needed`).
    *   **In-depth Investigation Loop:** `p_investigation_needed` leads to `t_ii` and then `p_investigated`. From `p_investigated`, an arc leads back to `t_fc`, forcing the Fraud Check activity to run again after the investigation. This allows for multiple investigation rounds.
    *   **Approval Choice:** `t_ca` leads to `p_assessed`. From `p_assessed`, either `t_approval_needed` fires (leading to `p_awaiting_approval` and then `t_ap`) or `t_approval_not_needed` fires (leading directly to `p_approved_or_not_needed`), modeling the conditional nature of the approval step.
    *   The process concludes with Payment, Notification, and Closure.
5.  **Initial Marking (`im`):** A `Marking` is created, placing one token in the starting place `p_start`.
6.  **Final Marking (`fm`):** Another `Marking` is created, defining the goal state with one token in the final place `p_closed`.

This code constructs the accepting Petri net as required, modeling the flow, choices, and loops described in the insurance claim scenario.
