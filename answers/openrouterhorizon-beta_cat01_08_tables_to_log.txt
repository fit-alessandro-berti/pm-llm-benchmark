Below is a consolidated event log with one row per event. Case ID is order_id. Activities are derived from the lifecycle: Order Created, Item Picked (per line), Order Dispatched (per delivery), Order Arrived (per delivery), Invoice Issued (per invoice), Payment Received (per payment). Resources are mapped using the Resources table when available.

Assumptions:
- One “Item Picked” event per order line using item_picking_date; includes item details and picker.
- One “Order Dispatched” and “Order Arrived” event per delivery using carrier as resource; delivery_note kept as attribute.
- One “Invoice Issued” event per invoice; billing person as resource.
- One “Payment Received” event per payment; payment_method/reference captured; resource left blank (payer unspecified).
- Orders without downstream data simply have the events that exist (e.g., 1004 has no delivery/invoice/payment).
- Timestamps are already in UTC (Z) and used as-is.

Notes for process mining:
- Sort by Case ID and Timestamp to obtain the event sequence.
- Resource mapping used resource_name where available; both IDs and names are present in attributes when useful.
- If you prefer a single “Items Picked (All)” summary per order, you could aggregate earliest and latest pick times; here we retained line-level granularity to preserve detail and parallelism.
