###  **1. Issues with the Current Model**

The current process tree model is **underfitting** because it allows **unrealistic and non-conforming execution sequences**, violating the logical dependencies inherent in the **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** process.

####  Key Problems:

| Issue | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Parallel execution of critical steps** | The `PARALLEL` block allows `Create_PO`, `Receive_Goods`, `Receive_Invoice`, `Match_Invoice`, and `Pay_Invoice` to occur **in any order**, including: <br> - Paying the invoice *before* receiving goods <br> - Matching the invoice *before* receiving it <br> - Creating a PO *before* the requisition is approved (though this is not directly possible here due to sequence, the *later* steps are still out of order) |
| **Missing dependency enforcement** | The model does **not enforce** that: <br> - `Receive_Goods` must happen **before** `Match_Invoice` <br> - `Match_Invoice` must happen **before** `Pay_Invoice` <br> - `Receive_Invoice` must happen **before** `Match_Invoice` <br> - `Create_PO` must happen **after** `Approve_Purchase_Requisition` (though this is enforced in the current model, the rest is not) |
| **Unrealistic execution paths** | The model allows: <br> - Paying the invoice without ever receiving goods  **financial risk** <br> - Matching an invoice that hasn’t been received  **invalid** <br> - Creating a PO without a prior approved requisition  **non-compliant** (though partially enforced) |
| **No control over conditional logic** | There is no mechanism to handle exceptions (e.g., goods not received, invoice mismatch), but even more critically, **no sequence enforcement** for downstream steps. |

---

###  **2. Corrected Process Tree Model (Fixed Version)**

We will **replace the parallel block with a strict sequence**, ensuring each activity occurs **only after its prerequisites** are completed. We also preserve the initial steps and final closure.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Define activities (same as before)
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Build the corrected process tree with strict sequence
# Enforce: 
# 1. Create Req  Approve Req  Create PO  Receive Goods  Receive Invoice  Match  Pay  Close

root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,
    approve_req,
    create_po,
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice,
    close_case
])
```

>  **Note**: This is a **fully sequential** model. No parallelism, no choices. All steps must occur **in order**.

---

###  **3. Explanation: Why the Fixed Model Ensures Domain Compliance**

####  **Enforced Logical Dependencies**

| Step | Must Follow | Why It's Enforced |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `Create_Purchase_Requisition` | — | Initial trigger |
| `Approve_Purchase_Requisition` | `Create_Purchase_Requisition` | Approval required before PO creation |
| `Create_Purchase_Order` | `Approve_Purchase_Requisition` | PO cannot be created without approved requisition |
| `Receive_Goods` | `Create_Purchase_Order` | Goods can only be received after PO is issued |
| `Receive_Invoice` | `Receive_Goods` | Invoice can be received after goods are received (but not required to be *before*) — **but in reality, invoice may come before or after** |
| `Match_Invoice_to_PO` | `Receive_Goods` AND `Receive_Invoice` | Requires both goods and invoice to match |
| `Pay_Invoice` | `Match_Invoice_to_PO` | Payment only allowed after successful match |
| `Close_Case` | `Pay_Invoice` | Final step; case cannot close before payment |

>  **Important Note**: In real-world P2P, **the invoice may arrive before or after goods**, but the **matching** step **must** wait for **both** goods and invoice.

However, in the **current model**, we are enforcing **strict sequence** for all steps. This is **safe and correct** for the purpose of **preventing invalid behavior** — even if it's slightly more restrictive than real life.

But to be more realistic, we could **allow invoice to come before goods**, but still enforce that **matching and payment** only happen **after both** are received.

---

###  **Even Better (Optional Advanced Fix): Use Choice + Parallel for Flexibility**

If we want to **allow flexibility** in the timing of invoice and goods (e.g., invoice arrives before goods), but still **prevent invalid flows**, we can use a **choice** (`XOR`) between the two paths:

```python
# Alternative: More realistic but still correct
# Allow invoice and goods in either order, but require both before match

# Step: After receiving goods and invoice, match and pay
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")

# Parallel block: goods and invoice can come in any order
goods_invoice_parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice
])

# After both, match must happen
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")

# Build full sequence
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,
    approve_req,
    create_po,
    goods_invoice_parallel,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice,
    close_case
])
```

>  This model:
> - Allows **invoice before goods** or **goods before invoice**
> - Ensures **both are received** before matching
> - Prevents **matching before both are received**
> - Prevents **payment before matching**
> - Prevents **payment before goods/invoice**
> - Still enforces the required sequence of PO creation after approval

---

###  **Final Recommendation: Use the Second (Flexible) Model**

While the fully sequential model is **safe and correct**, it's **overly restrictive** in practice.

The **best fix** is the **flexible parallel model** with a **PARALLEL block for receiving goods and invoice**, followed by **match  pay  close**.

####  **Recommended Final Model**:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Activities
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Parallel block for flexible receipt of goods and invoice
goods_invoice_parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice
])

# Full sequence with proper dependencies
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,
    approve_req,
    create_po,
    goods_invoice_parallel,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice,
    close_case
])
```

---

###  **Summary: How the Fixed Model Prevents Unwanted Behavior**

| Unwanted Behavior | Prevented By |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Paying invoice before receiving goods | `pay_invoice` only after `match_invoice`, which requires both goods and invoice |
| Matching invoice before receiving it | `match_invoice` only after both `receive_goods` and `receive_invoice` |
| Creating PO before approval | `create_po` comes after `approve_req` in sequence |
| Closing case before payment | `close_case` is last in sequence |
| Receiving goods before PO | `receive_goods` comes after `create_po` |
| Invoice received but never matched | `match_invoice` is required before `pay_invoice` |

>  **The corrected model enforces all domain-specific dependencies** and **eliminates all invalid paths**, while still allowing **realistic flexibility** in the timing of goods and invoice receipt.

###  Final Answer:  **Use the Flexible Parallel Model Above**

It is **correct, realistic, and fully compliant** with the Procure-to-Pay process logic.
