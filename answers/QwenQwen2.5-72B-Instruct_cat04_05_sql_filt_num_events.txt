Certainly! Below is a draft of the DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task as described:

```sql
WITH event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM 
        event_counts
    WHERE 
        event_count <= 6
)
SELECT 
    e.case_id, 
    e.activity, 
    e.timestamp
FROM 
    event_log e
JOIN 
    filtered_cases f
ON 
    e.case_id = f.case_id
ORDER BY 
    e.case_id, 
    e.timestamp;
```

### Explanation:
1. **event_counts CTE (Common Table Expression):**
   - This CTE calculates the number of events for each `case_id` by grouping the `event_log` table by `case_id` and counting the number of rows for each group.
   
2. **filtered_cases CTE:**
   - This CTE filters the `case_id`s to include only those where the `event_count` is 6 or fewer.

3. **Final SELECT Statement:**
   - This part of the query joins the original `event_log` table with the `filtered_cases` CTE on the `case_id` to get the full set of events for the cases that have 6 or fewer events.
   - The result is ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain a logical sequence of events.

This query ensures that only cases with 6 or fewer events are included in the final result, and it returns the full set of events for those cases.
