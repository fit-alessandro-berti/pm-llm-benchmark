Let's analyze each case in the event log to determine if they violate the normative process description.

### Normative Process Rules Summary:
1. The process must start with "Receive order."
2. After "Receive order," the next step must be "Check inventory."
3. If inventory is sufficient:
   - Next steps must be (in order): "Authorize payment," "Package items," "Ship order," "Close order."
4. If inventory is insufficient:
   - Next steps must be: "Cancel order," then "Close order."
   - No fulfillment activities ("Authorize payment," "Package items," "Ship order") should occur after cancellation.
5. Additional constraints:
   - "Authorize payment" must come after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."
   - "Package items" must come after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
   - "Ship order" must come after "Package items" and before "Close order."
   - "Close order" must be the last activity in all cases.
   - No fulfillment activities (authorize payment, package, ship) should occur after cancellation.

### Case-by-Case Analysis:

#### Case 1:
Sequence:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Package items
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Evaluation:**
- This follows the normative process for sufficient inventory.
- All steps are in the correct order.
- No violations.

#### Case 2:
Sequence:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Package items
4. Authorize payment
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Evaluation:**
- The normative process requires "Authorize payment" to occur before "Package items."
- Here, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which violates the rule that payment must be authorized before packaging.
- Additionally, the description implies that packaging should only happen after payment authorization, as payment authorization is a prerequisite for fulfillment activities.

**Violation:**
"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," violating the required sequence.

#### Case 3:
Sequence:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Cancel order
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Evaluation:**
- "Cancel order" implies insufficient inventory. However, "Authorize payment" occurred before cancellation, which is unusual but not explicitly forbidden (though logically inconsistent, since payment shouldn't be authorized if inventory is insufficient).
- More critically, "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which violates the rule that fulfillment activities (like shipping) should not occur after cancellation.
- The normative process states that after cancellation, the next step should be "Close order," but here "Ship order" occurs after cancellation.

**Violations:**
1. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which is not allowed (fulfillment activities should not happen after cancellation).
2. Logically inconsistent to authorize payment before cancellation (since cancellation implies insufficient inventory, making payment authorization unnecessary).

#### Case 4:
Sequence:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Cancel order
4. Close order

**Evaluation:**
- This follows the normative process for insufficient inventory.
- No fulfillment activities occur after cancellation.
- No violations.

#### Case 5:
Sequence:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Ship order
5. Close order

**Evaluation:**
- The normative process requires "Package items" between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order."
- Here, "Ship order" occurs directly after "Authorize payment," skipping "Package items."
- The description states: "only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'"

**Violation:**
"Ship order" occurs without "Package items" preceding it, violating the sequence constraint.

### Summary of Violations:
1. **Case 2:**
   - Violation: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
   - Rule violated: "Authorize payment" must occur before "Package items."

2. **Case 3:**
   - Violations:
     1. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order" (fulfillment activity after cancellation is not allowed).
     2. "Authorize payment" occurs before cancellation (logically inconsistent, though not explicitly forbidden in the description).

3. **Case 5:**
   - Violation: "Ship order" occurs without "Package items" preceding it.
   - Rule violated: "Package items" must occur before "Ship order."

---

### Final Answer:
The cases that violate the normative process are **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5**. Here are the violations:

1. **Case 2:**
   - Violation: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
   - Explanation: The normative process requires that payment must be authorized before items are packaged. This ensures that items are only prepared for shipment after payment is confirmed.

2. **Case 3:**
   - Violation 1: "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
     - Explanation: Once an order is canceled (due to insufficient inventory), fulfillment activities like shipping should not occur. The process should proceed directly to "Close order."
   - Violation 2: "Authorize payment" occurs before cancellation.
     - Explanation: While not explicitly forbidden, it is logically inconsistent to authorize payment for an order that will subsequently be canceled due to insufficient inventory. Payment authorization should not happen if the order cannot be fulfilled.

3. **Case 5:**
   - Violation: "Ship order" occurs without "Package items" preceding it.
   - Explanation: Items must be packaged before they can be shipped, as indicated by the normative description. Skipping the packaging step violates the required sequence.

Cases 1 and 4 follow the normative process without violations.
