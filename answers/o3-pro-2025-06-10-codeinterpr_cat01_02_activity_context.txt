Step 1 – Find activities that repeat inside the same case  
• Verify Documents – appears twice in C001 and C003.  
• Call Customer      – appears twice in C002 and once elsewhere.  
(Other activities occur only once per case, so they stay unchanged.)

Step 2 – Read the context of every repeated occurrence  

Verify Documents  
– First position in every case = the routine, up-front identity check.  
– Second position in C001 = second check after the customer supplied the missing ID scan.  
– Second position in C003 = second check after an internal account correction.

Call Customer  
– C001: purpose is to obtain missing documents.  
– C002 (1st): purpose is to clarify an account discrepancy.  
– C002 (2nd): purpose is to confirm the internal adjustments just made.  
– C003: purpose is to ask the walk-in customer to return to the counter.

Step 3 – Rename the activities so the intention is obvious  

Verify Documents (Initial ID Check)  
Verify Documents (Second Check – Added Docs)  
Verify Documents (Post-Adjustment Check)

Call Customer (Request Missing Docs)  
Call Customer (Clarify Discrepancy)  
Call Customer (Confirm Adjustments)  
Call Customer (Recall to Branch)

Step 4 – Revised event log with the new activity names  

| Case ID | Activity                                             | Timestamp            | Resource           | Additional Context                                              |

Step 5 – Justification in one line per rename  

• “Verify Documents (Initial ID Check)” – first, routine ID review; positionbased.  
• “Verify Documents (Second Check – Added Docs)” – same case resumes after customer supplies missing material; context “now that ID scan is provided.”  
• “Verify Documents (Post-Adjustment Check)” – second verification triggered by an internal account correction; clue “after account adjustment.”  
• “Call Customer (Request Missing Docs)” – outbound call whose goal is to obtain additional documentation.  
• “Call Customer (Clarify Discrepancy)” – first C002 call; note “clarify account discrepancy.”  
• “Call Customer (Confirm Adjustments)” – follow-up C002 call; note “confirm adjustments made.”  
• “Call Customer (Recall to Branch)” – C003 call meant to bring the customer back to the counter.
