Based on the provided process variants and their execution times, here are the main differences and potential unfair treatments between the protected and unprotected groups:

1. **Loan Denial and Approval Rates:**
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of loan denials (both after application rejection and underwriter review) compared to loan approvals.
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of loan approvals (signing loan agreements) compared to loan denials.

2. **Process Complexity:**
   - The protected group has more complex processes, with multiple visits to assess collateral and requests for co-signers, before loan denial or approval.
   - The unprotected group has simpler processes, with fewer steps before loan denial or approval.

3. **Performance (Execution Time):**
   - The protected group generally has shorter execution times for loan denials and approvals compared to the unprotected group. This could indicate that less effort or scrutiny is applied to the protected group's applications.
   - The unprotected group has longer execution times, which might suggest more thorough reviews or additional steps in the process.

4. **Skipped Examination:**
   - There is a process variant in the unprotected group where the examination is skipped, and the loan agreement is signed directly. This does not occur in the protected group, indicating a potential bias or preferential treatment.

5. **Appointment Denial:**
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of appointment denials compared to the unprotected group. This could indicate unfair treatment at the early stages of the loan application process.

6. **Co-Signer Requests:**
   - The protected group has more frequent requests for co-signers compared to the unprotected group. This could indicate a higher level of scrutiny or mistrust in the protected group's financial credibility.

These differences suggest potential unfair treatment of the protected group, with higher denial rates, more complex processes, shorter review times, and more frequent requests for co-signers. However, it is essential to conduct a thorough statistical analysis and consider other factors to confirm these findings and identify the root causes of the disparities.
