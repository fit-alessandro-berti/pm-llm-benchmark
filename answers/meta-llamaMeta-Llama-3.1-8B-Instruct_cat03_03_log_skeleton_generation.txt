Here's an example of a Log Skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('receive_invoice', 'receive_invoice')},  # two invoices are equivalent
    'always_before': {('receive_invoice', 'approve_invoice'), ('order_goods', 'receive_invoice')},  # invoice approval must happen before goods receipt
    'always_after': {('approve_invoice', 'order_goods')},  # order goods after invoice approval
    'never_together': {('receive_invoice', 'approve_invoice')},  # invoice cannot be received and approved at the same time
    'activ_freq': {'receive_invoice': {0, 1}, 'approve_invoice': {1}, 'order_goods': {1}, 'pay_invoice': {1}},  # receive_invoice can occur 0 or 1 time, approve_invoice must occur 1 time, etc.
    'directly_follows': {('order_goods', 'receive_invoice'), ('approve_invoice', 'order_goods'), ('pay_invoice', 'approve_invoice')}  # certain activities must occur immediately after others
}
```
In this example, the `equivalence` constraint ensures that multiple invoices received at the same time are treated as equivalent. The `always_before` constraint ensures that invoice approval happens before goods receipt, and that an invoice must be received before it can be approved. The `always_after` constraint ensures that an order for goods must be placed after invoice approval. The `never_together` constraint prevents an invoice from being received and approved at the same time. The `activ_freq` constraint specifies the allowed number of occurrences for each activity. Finally, the `directly_follows` constraint specifies the sequence of activities that must occur one after the other.

Note that this is just one possible example of a Log Skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process, and there may be other valid models that satisfy the same constraints.
