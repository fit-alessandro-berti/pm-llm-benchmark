Here is an example of a Log Skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
# Purchase-to-Pay Log Skeleton
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('order_receive', 'purchase_order_received')},
    'always_before': {('invoicing', 'payment_instruction')},
    'always_after': {('payment_received', 'accounts_payable_updated')},
    'never_together': {('invoicing', 'payment_instruction')},
    'activ_freq': {
        'order_receive': {0, 1},
        'invoicing': {1},
        'payment_instruction': {1},
        'payment_received': {1},
        'accounts_payable_updated': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {('order_receive', 'invoicing')}
}
```
Here's a brief explanation of each constraint:

* `equivalence`: If an `order_receive` occurs, it has the same occurrences as a `purchase_order_received`. In this case, it's assumed that a purchase order is received when an order is received.
* `always_before`: Before a payment instruction is sent, an invoicing activity has occurred.
* `always_after`: After a payment is received, the accounts payables are updated (this constraint implies a workflow where payment receiving and accounts payable update are consecutive activities).
* `never_together`: Invoicing and payment instruction cannot occur at the same time.
* `activ_freq`: Each activity is bounded by the allowed number of occurrences:
	+ `order_receive` can occur 0 or 1 time.
	+ `invoicing` must occur exactly 1 time.
	+ `payment_instruction` must occur exactly 1 time.
	+ `payment_received` and `accounts_payable_updated` must occur exactly 1 time each.
* `directly_follows`: If an `order_receive` occurs, the next activity must be `invoicing`.

This is a simple example to demonstrate how the Log Skeleton process model can capture the declarative constraints of a business process. In a real-world scenario, you would need to adapt and extend this model to fit the specific requirements of your Purchase-to-Pay process.
