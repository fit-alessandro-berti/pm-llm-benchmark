To identify potentially sensitive attributes for fairness in the provided event log, we need to focus on attributes that could be related to protected characteristics or groups as defined by various fairness and anti-discrimination laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, EEO, etc.). These typically include, but are not limited to:

1. **Gender**
2. **Marital Status**
3. **National Origin** (sometimes inferred through language proficiency)
4. **Age** (not explicitly listed here, but often a consideration)
5. **Citizenship Status**

Based on the attributes provided in your event log, the following could be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:gender**: This attribute directly relates to gender, which is a protected characteristic.
   
2. **case:citizen**: This likely refers to citizenship status, which can also be a protected characteristic in many contexts.

3. **case:married**: Marital status is another attribute that might be subject to fairness considerations, as it relates to personal and family life.

4. **case:german speaking**: While language proficiency itself is not always a protected class, when considered in the context of "national origin" or discrimination based on ethnicity, it could raise fairness concerns if decisions are made that disproportionately affect individuals based on their language preference or proficiency. However, this is more context-dependent compared to the direct protected characteristics like gender, citizenship, and marital status.

**Recommendation for Handling Sensitive Attributes:**

- **Anonymization/Pseudonymization**: If not already done, consider anonymizing or pseudonymizing these attributes in your dataset if they are not crucial for the immediate analysis goals.
  
- **Fairness Audits and Testing**: Regularly perform fairness audits on your models and decision-making processes to ensure that outcomes are equitable across different groups defined by these sensitive attributes.

- **Contextual Understanding**: For attributes like language proficiency, understand the context in which decisions are made. Ensure that any impacts are justified and do not disproportionately disadvantage protected groups.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Familiarize yourself with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, EEO laws) to ensure compliance in handling sensitive information and in making fair decisions.
