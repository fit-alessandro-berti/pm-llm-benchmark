The diagram is a Sankey diagram that illustrates the flow of fines through different stages over time. The horizontal axis represents the timeline, starting from 2000-01-25 and extending to 2013-04-24. The vertical axis is divided into three main stages: "Send Fine," 'Insert Fine Notification,' and 'Send for Credit Collection.' The diagram shows the progression of fines through these stages, with the width of the flows indicating the volume of fines at each stage. The flows are color-coded, with grey representing the initial stage of sending fines and red indicating the transition to sending for credit collection. The diagram highlights the movement and transformation of fines as they progress from being sent out to being inserted into notifications and eventually sent for credit collection. The main message conveyed is the process and volume of fines over time, illustrating how fines are managed and transitioned through different administrative stages.
