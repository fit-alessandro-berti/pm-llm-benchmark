# Precision Parts Inc.: Process Mining-Driven Advanced Scheduling Approach

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

To develop sophisticated scheduling improvements, thorough analysis of the MES logs using Process Mining will reconstruct and characterize the actual operational behaviors.

### Process Reconstruction Using Event Logs:
- **Process Discovery:**
  - Execute process mining algorithms such as Directly-Follows graphs and Inductive Miner on MES logs.
  - Visualize detailed process flow variants, highlighting frequent and aberrant job execution sequences and routing paths.

- **Sequence Analysis:**
  - Identify predominant task sequences for typical product families and quantify their variability.
  - Leverage conformance checking algorithms to analyze deviations from planned sequences.

- **Performance Analysis:**
  **Specific Techniques and Metrics:**
    
  - **Job Flow Times & Lead Times:**
    - Derive timestamps from "Task Start", "Task End", and "Queue Entry/Exit" events.
    - Compute flow times (start to end), lead times (release to completion), and makespan.
    - Generate distribution metrics (mean, median, standard deviation) to identify variability patterns.

  - **Task Waiting Times (Queues):**
    - Identify queue durations explicitly using "Queue Entry" and subsequent "Setup Start"/"Task Start" timestamps.
    - Aggregate queue lengths and waiting time statistics (mean, extremes, frequency of long waits).

  - **Resource Utilization:**
    - Create time-based resource utilization profiles distinguishing productive time, setup time, and idle time using Statistical Process Mining.
    - Benchmark resources by analyzing proportions (productive utilization %, setup %, idle %).

  - **Sequence-Dependent Setup Analysis:**
    - Extract job sequence pairs (previous/current) with associated setup durations ("Setup Start"/"Setup End" timestamps).
    - Cluster setup times based on explicit attributes (material, specification, etc.) from historical job pairings; construct a data-driven matrix of average sequence-dependent setup times.

  - **Schedule Adherence (Tardiness Analysis):**
    - Measure task/job lateness using actual completion vs. planned due dates.
    - Evaluate magnitude and frequency of overdue deliveries categorized by job type, priority, and routing complexity.

  - **Impact of Disruptions:**
    - Analyze the temporal correlation between "Breakdown Start"/"Priority Change" events and KPI deterioration (increase in waiting times, prolonged setup, missed due dates).
    - Quantify ramifications with impact assessments, e.g., added tardiness or machine utilization losses due to disruptions.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies through Process Mining Insights

Identifying inefficiencies from performance analytics:

- **Bottleneck Identification:**
  - Apply bottleneck analysis algorithms (e.g., process mining resource bottleneck detection) to MES logs, pinpointing machines like CNC Milling (e.g., MILL-02 or MILL-03) with highest queues and greatest workload congestion.

- **Poor Priority Handling Evidence:**
  - Variant analysis: compare timing profiles of urgent/high-priority jobs versus medium/low ones, highlighting instances of delayed attention and misprioritization.

- **Suboptimal Setup Sequences:**
  - Analyze setup times relative to job sequences on critical resources; identify frequent suboptimal sequences causing prolonged non-productive setups.

- **Downstream Resource Starvation:**
  - Identify gaps in utilization of downstream processes caused by lagging upstream centers through correlation analysis of waiting cues and idle times—a common source of starvation.

- **Bullwhip Effect (WIP Variability):**
  - Examine temporal-series WIP inventory level fluctuations at individual workcenters, correlating sudden increases in incoming WIP with upstream scheduling decisions and response dynamics.

Utilizing advanced variant analysis and resource queue synchronization pattern identification in process mining platforms (Celonis, Apromore, ProM) provides empirical evidence of these pathologies.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

Through combined data and operational insight:

- **Static Dispatching Rules’ Limitations:**
  - Rules based solely on due dates or FCFS don't respond dynamically. MES logs demonstrate frequent cases of downstream starvation or job congestion despite following existing rules.

- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
  - Visible through frequent reaction lags post-disruption events, the MES evidence shows delayed resource response due to fragmented information flows.

- **Inaccurate Estimates of Task/Setup Durations:**
  - Historical deviations of actual vs. planned durations quantitatively demonstrated through statistical analysis of MES event logs, indicating chronic planning underestimates.

- **Inefficient Sequence-dependent Setup Handling:**
  - Evidenced by variability and high percentage of prolonged setups, indicating current scheduling logic doesn’t effectively anticipate and sequence compatible jobs to reduce setups.

- **Insufficient Coordination Between Work Centers:**
  - Cross-resource synchronization analysis highlights misalignments, causing unnecessary WIP accumulation and productivity losses.

- **Poor Reaction Strategy to Disruptions:**
  - MES logs clearly show reactive backlog recalculations and long secondary delays post-breakdown events or priority shifts.

Process mining clearly differentiates between inefficiencies caused by scheduling logic (frequent avoidable sequence-dependent setups, delays in prioritization, mismatch between workload and capacity) versus intrinsic limitations (inherent variability in processes and unavoidable disruptions).

## 4. Development of Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

**Strategy 1 — Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules:**
- **Core Logic:**
  - Multi-criteria dispatching based on dynamic weighted scores including:
    - Due-date adherence probabilities (historically derived),
    - Sequence-dependent setup minimization (data-mined setup matrices),
    - Job priority and downstream workload estimation.
- **Use of Process Mining Data:**
  - Task-level queue insights and job-history setups shape optimized weighting coefficients.
- **Potential KPI Impact:**
  - Major reductions in tardiness and setup time; improved throughput predictability and WIP control.

**Strategy 2 — Predictive Scheduling with Bayesian Forecasting Models:**
- **Core Logic:**
  - Historical runtime distributions (extracted via process mining) inform probabilistic job-duration estimates.
  - Predictive maintenance insights derived from log (breakdown frequencies/patterns) and integrated to proactively allocate resources and buffer capacity.
- **Use of Process Mining Data:**
  - Build accurate probabilistic duration models predictive of bottleneck occurrence.
- **Potential KPI Impact:**
  - Improved lead-time reliability and reduced impact of disruptions; significantly tighter schedule adherence; minimized severity of disruptions due to proactive response planning.

**Strategy 3 — Intelligent Setup-Time Optimization:**
- **Core Logic:**
  - Sequence clustering of similar-setup jobs into optimal batches at key bottleneck resources; employing historical setup-statistics clustering algorithms (k-means, hierarchical clustering from logs).
- **Use of Process Mining Data:**
  - Setup durations and sequence-dependency patterns extracted quantitatively by mining historical setups.
- **Potential KPI Impact:**
  - Major setup-time efficiency gains; dramatic reduction in machine idle-time; improved machine utilization; decreased overall flow and lead times.
