Bias is exhibited in the **Group B log**.

1. **Score adjustments tied to non-relevant attributes**:  
   Applicants in Group B receive a **constant +10 “Community Boost”** if they are  
   - **LocalResident = TRUE**, **and**  
   - **CommunityGroup  None** (here, “Highland Civic Darts Club”).  

   This adjustment is **absent for Group A**; members of this Protected Group never have **LocalResident = TRUE** and are **never assigned to “Highland Civic Darts Club”**, so they cannot trigger the boost. The only protected-group cases (P001-P003) have **LocalResident = FALSE** and **CommunityGroup = None**, effectively shielding them from the +10 points.

2. **Systematic difference in final scores and decisions**:  
   - **U001** – Preliminary 720  Adjusted 730  Approved  
   - **U003** – Preliminary 695  Adjusted 705  Approved (would have been rejected at 695, appears to clear threshold after boost)  

   No such elevation occurs for the protected applicants. Even though Group A contains an applicant with a higher raw score (P003, 740) and one with the same raw score as U001 (P001, 720), none receive the +10 adjustment.

3. **Proxy for group membership**:  
   Because **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup** are correlated with the **Group-B identifier**, the +10 “boost” behaves as **a proxy rule privileging the Unprotected Group exclusively**. This creates a **systematic outcome difference**: the same or lower raw-scoring applicant in Group B is more likely to cross the approval threshold than an equally qualified Group A applicant, demonstrating **direct disparate impact** based on group membership rather than genuine risk factors.
