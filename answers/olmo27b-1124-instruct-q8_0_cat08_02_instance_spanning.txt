### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

**Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints:**

- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:** These stations can limit throughput when multiple orders require cold packing. The event log shows timestamps indicating which orders are waiting for cold-packing stations, highlighting the constraint.
- **Shipping Batches:** Orders batched together can delay individual order completion times due to the need to wait for all orders in the batch to be ready.
- **Priority Order Handling:** Express shipping orders require priority, potentially causing standard orders to wait when an express order reaches the packing or quality check station.
- **Hazardous Material Limits:** Regulatory restrictions can lead to bottlenecks if more than 10 hazardous materials orders are simultaneously being processed.

**Impact Metrics:**

- **Waiting Time Due to Resource Contention:** Measure the average time orders spend waiting for cold-packing stations, shipping batch formation, and critical resources during priority handling.
- **Completion Time Deviations:** Calculate the standard deviation of completion times to quantify variability caused by instance-spanning constraints.
- **Throughput Reduction:** Evaluate the percentage reduction in potential fulfillment throughput due to these constraints.

**Differentiating Waiting Time Causes:**

- **Within-instance:** Delayed activities within an order (e.g., prolonged packing time).
- **Between-instance:** Delays due to sharing resources or waiting for other orders to complete.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

**Interactions Between Constraints:**

- **Priority Handling and Cold-Packing:** Express orders requiring cold packing might preempt standard orders at shared stations, exacerbating wait times.
- **Hazardous Material Limits and Batching:** If multiple hazardous orders are batched together and destined for the same region, batching might be delayed due to regulatory constraints, affecting entire batches.

Understanding these interactions is crucial because they compound the complexity of optimizing the fulfillment process. For instance, improving cold-packing station availability might only partially alleviate bottlenecks if express orders consistently occupy these stations.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Shared Stations**

- **Addressed Constraint:** Shared Cold-Packing Stations
- **Changes:** Implement a system that prioritizes express orders at cold-packing stations and dynamically allocates standard orders to non-cold stations or alternative resources.
- **Leveraging Data/Analysis:** Predictive algorithms can forecast demand for cold-packing, adjusting staff schedules and resource allocation to minimize waiting times.

**Strategy 2: Dynamic Batch Formation Logic**

- **Addressed Constraint:** Shipping Batches
- **Changes:** Adjust batch formation logic based on real-time status of orders and regional shipping demands to create smaller, more frequent batches that can expedite order completion.
- **Leveraging Data/Analysis:** Use historical data to optimize batch sizes, ensuring better resource utilization and reduced bottlenecks.

**Strategy 3: Improved Scheduling Rules Considering Priorities and Limits**

- **Addressed Constraint:** Priority Handling and Hazardous Material Limits
- **Changes:** Implement a scheduling system that automatically prioritizes express orders, while also ensuring compliance with hazardous material regulations.
- **Leveraging Data/Analysis:** Incorporate machine learning algorithms to predict the arrival of express orders and adjust processing schedules accordingly.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

**Simulation Techniques:**

- **Use:** Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models informed by process mining data to mimic real-world scenarios.
- **Focuses:** Simulate different resource allocation strategies, batch formation, and priority handling policies under various demand scenarios.
- **Validate Impact on KPIs:** Measure reduction in average waiting times, increased throughput, and compliance with regulations.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

**Monitoring Metrics & Dashboards:**

- **Key Metrics:**
    - Average waiting times at shared resources and critical points (e.g., cold-packing stations).
    - Completion time variance.
    - Throughput rates and percentage utilization of resources.
    - Compliance with hazardous material limits.

**Process Mining Dashboards:**

- **Cold-Packing Station Utilization:** Real-time dashboard showing current and historical usage, helping identify peak times and potential for additional stations.
- **Batch Formation Efficiency:** Monitor the effectiveness of batch sizes and formation triggers to ensure minimal delays without compromising delivery schedules.
- **Priority Handling Performance:** Dashboard to track express order processing against standard orders, ensuring express orders do not excessively delay standard orders.

By continuously monitoring these metrics and dashboard indicators, the company can promptly identify emerging issues and implement corrective measures, maintaining a high level of efficiency in the fulfillment center.
