1. **Initial intake and qualification**
   - When a landlord first contacts the regional office, how do you determine whether the property is even eligible for your services (e.g., minimum size, location, condition, landlord profile)?
   - Is there a standardized intake form or checklist that the property coordinator uses during the first conversation with the landlord? What key information must be captured at this stage?
   - How do you handle situations where multiple people at the landlord’s side are involved (e.g., co-owners, asset managers, attorneys)? Who is treated as the “primary” contact?

2. **Documentation and compliance**
   - What specific documents are always required before you can move forward, and which ones are “nice to have” but not mandatory?
   - How do you decide whether a document is “too old” or needs renewal (e.g., inspection reports, compliance certificates)? Are there standard validity periods?
   - When documents are missing or outdated, how is the follow-up handled and tracked? Who is responsible for chasing the landlord or authorities?
   - Are there different documentation requirements by city or property type, and how do coordinators know which rules apply?

3. **Data entry and property profile**
   - What fields are captured in the central property database beyond the basics you mentioned (e.g., HOA rules, zoning restrictions, utilities setup, parking details)?
   - Are there any approval steps or validation rules before a new property record is considered “complete” and usable by other teams?
   - How are changes to property details handled later (e.g., landlord changes pet policy or upgrades amenities)? Who is allowed to update the record?

4. **Assignment of the property manager**
   - How is a property manager’s workload and specialization measured when deciding who to assign (e.g., number of units, complexity rating, distance)?
   - Who makes the final decision on which property manager to assign, and is there any automated support or is it purely judgment-based?
   - Are there ever conflicts or reassignments (e.g., landlord requests a different manager, or the manager leaves the company)? How is that transition handled?

5. **Expectations-setting with the landlord**
   - What standard topics or agenda items are always covered in the initial call/meeting between the property manager and the landlord?
   - How are special conditions or landlord-specific policies documented and communicated to other teams (leasing, operations, finance)?
   - Do you ever decline or renegotiate certain landlord requests (e.g., extreme restrictions, unusual clauses)? What criteria drive that decision?

6. **Inspections, photography, and property readiness**
   - Is there a standard inspection checklist and minimum condition threshold that a property must meet before being marketed?
   - How do you prioritize or sequence the photography and inspection—can they happen in parallel, or does one depend on the other?
   - When issues are found in inspection, who decides whether they are “must-fix” versus “nice-to-fix” before listing the property?
   - How do you manage relationships with external contractors and inspectors (e.g., SLAs, preferred vendors, quality checks)?

7. **Repairs, remediation, and delays**
   - How are repair tasks initiated, approved, and tracked (e.g., cost approvals, landlord sign-off, timelines)?
   - What happens when repairs significantly delay the onboarding—do you have time limits or escalation paths?
   - How do you handle situations where the landlord refuses to carry out recommended repairs or only partially agrees?

8. **Pricing and marketing**
   - How is the initial expected rental price range refined into a final listing price? Who has the authority to set or override that price?
   - What data sources or market signals does the digital marketing or pricing team rely on when updating the internal pricing models?
   - Are there standard marketing packages or tiers (basic vs premium marketing), and how is the choice made for a particular property?
   - At what point is the decision made about which channels to use (own portal, third-party sites, social media, brokers), and who decides?

9. **Activation in systems**
   - What criteria must be met before a property is considered ready to be “activated” in your rental portal and internal systems?
   - Are there different activation statuses (e.g., draft, pending approval, live, temporarily offline)? How do these statuses affect what tenants can see or do?
   - Who has final sign-off that all pre-activation steps (documentation, inspection, pricing) are complete and acceptable?

10. **Tenant screening and selection**
    - What is your standard tenant screening process from the moment an application is received to the final decision?
    - Are there defined, objective criteria for approval/denial (income thresholds, credit score minima, eviction history), or is it more case-by-case?
    - When multiple qualified applicants are competing, how do you prioritize among them (e.g., earliest application, longest lease term, highest rent, landlord preferences)?
    - How are fair housing and anti-discrimination rules embedded in the decision-making so individual managers don’t inadvertently violate policies?

11. **Lease negotiation and execution**
    - To what extent are lease terms standardized versus negotiable (e.g., deposit amount, lease length, renewal options, rent increases)?
    - How are custom clauses from landlords handled—who reviews and approves these, especially from a legal and compliance perspective?
    - What tools or processes do you use to ensure that the final signed lease matches what was verbally agreed (e.g., version control, approvals)?
    - How is the move-in date coordinated with readiness of the property (cleaning, keys, utilities) and who is responsible for each part?

12. **Financial aspects**
    - How do you ensure the agreed rental amount, fees, and deposit structure are consistent with internal profitability targets?
    - Who is responsible for verifying that all financial elements (management fees, commissions, maintenance chargebacks) are correctly set up in your systems?
    - If the landlord’s expectations on rent conflict with your pricing strategy, how is that conflict handled?

13. **Compliance, audits, and quality checks**
    - At which stages do compliance or legal teams get involved, and what specifically are they checking (e.g., language, policies, local regulations)?
    - How often are internal audits of onboarding cases conducted, and what common issues do they typically uncover?
    - If a property is found non-compliant after being activated (e.g., discovered code violation, problematic clause), what steps do you take?

14. **Roles, responsibilities, and handoffs**
    - Could you walk through the process step-by-step and indicate which role “owns” each step and which roles are merely “supporting”?
    - Where do you see the most frequent handoffs between teams (e.g., from coordinators to property managers, from marketing to leasing), and what information must be passed at each handoff?
    - How are responsibilities clarified when multiple offices or departments are involved (e.g., regional vs central, operations vs marketing)?

15. **Communication and tools**
    - Which systems (CRM, project management tools, email, spreadsheets) are used at each stage, and how do they integrate or share data?
    - How is communication with landlords and tenants tracked, and how do you ensure important decisions are documented centrally rather than buried in email threads?
    - Are there known gaps or duplication in tools or data entry that cause errors or confusion?

16. **Timing, SLAs, and bottlenecks**
    - What is your typical end-to-end timeline from first landlord contact to the property being fully listed and ready for tenant move-in?
    - Do you have formal SLAs or target times for key steps (document review, assignment of manager, inspection, listing creation, etc.)?
    - Where do delays most commonly occur, and how are they monitored or escalated?

17. **Exceptions and special cases**
    - How do you handle properties with special requirements (e.g., student housing, short-term rentals, luxury units, rent-controlled properties)?
    - What happens when a property needs special insurance or has unusual legal constraints (easements, condo rules, historic building requirements)?
    - How do you deal with landlords who are very hands-on and want to approve every decision versus those who are entirely hands-off?
    - Are there documented exception-handling procedures, or are special cases handled ad hoc by experienced staff?

18. **Post-onboarding feedback and continuous improvement**
    - Once a property has gone through its first leasing cycle, do you review the onboarding to identify what worked well or needs improvement?
    - How is feedback from landlords, tenants, property managers, and internal teams gathered and fed back into process changes?
    - Have you made any significant changes to the process in the last year? What prompted those changes?

These questions should help surface more detail on how your process actually operates day-to-day, where decisions are made, and how you handle variations and edge cases.
