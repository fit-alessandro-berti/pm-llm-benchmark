1. **Intake and Initial Qualification**
   - How does a landlord’s request typically arrive (phone, email, web form), and is there any initial qualification before a coordinator invests time in review?
   - Are there criteria under which you decide *not* to onboard a property (e.g., location, minimum rent, property type, condition)?
   - At what point is a new property formally “accepted” into your pipeline, and who authorizes that?

2. **Documentation and Compliance**
   - What specific documents are mandatory for every property, and which are optional or vary by city or property type?
   - How do you determine whether documentation is “current” or “outdated” (e.g., inspections older than X months)?
   - When documentation is missing or non-compliant, what is the standard follow-up process and timeline before you close or pause the onboarding?
   - Are there differences in compliance requirements between regions or property types (e.g., student housing vs. luxury units)?

3. **Data Capture and Systems**
   - What core data fields must be entered into the central property database before the process can move to the next step?
   - Who is responsible for data quality—does anyone review or audit the data entered by the coordinator?
   - How are updates handled if property characteristics change later (renovations, added amenities, price adjustments)?

4. **Assignment of the Property Manager**
   - How is a property manager’s workload quantified when deciding who to assign (e.g., number of units, complexity score)?
   - Who actually makes the assignment decision—a person, a team, or is there a rule-based system supporting it?
   - Are there circumstances where a property manager is changed after initial assignment, and what triggers that reassignment?

5. **Landlord–Manager Alignment**
   - What is the typical agenda for the introductory call/meeting, and is there a standard checklist you follow?
   - How are special conditions (e.g., no pets, custom maintenance arrangements, unique payment preferences) documented and communicated internally?
   - If disagreements arise during this alignment stage (e.g., landlord wants a rent level you consider unrealistic), how are those resolved and by whom?

6. **Inspection and Photography**
   - How do you prioritize scheduling the photographer and inspector—are there typical lead times or service-level targets?
   - If the inspection fails or identifies issues, how do you decide whether the company will coordinate repairs vs. leaving that fully to the landlord?
   - Are there thresholds of issues that cause you to reject a property altogether, or just delay activation until resolved?
   - How is the completion and outcome of inspection and photography communicated back to the coordinator and other stakeholders?

7. **Pricing and Marketing**
   - Who sets the initial pricing range for the property, and how is the company’s pricing model applied in practice?
   - When the digital marketing team prepares listings and brochures, what inputs do they rely on besides the database (e.g., inspector notes, manager feedback)?
   - How do you handle situations where marketing wants to position/price the property differently from what the landlord expects?
   - Are there standard approval steps before a listing goes live, and who signs off?

8. **Activation in Systems and Portals**
   - What conditions must be met before a property is marked as “activated” (e.g., inspection passed, photos uploaded, price approved)?
   - Which teams are notified when a property moves from “in onboarding” to “active,” and how is that notification handled?
   - How do you manage properties that are activated but then temporarily pulled from the market (e.g., landlord changes mind, repairs needed)?

9. **Tenant Screening and Selection**
   - What is your standard screening policy, and to what extent can property managers deviate based on landlord preferences?
   - How do you prioritize between multiple qualified applicants—are there formal criteria beyond “first come, first served”?
   - How are negotiations on lease terms, discounts, or lease length documented and approved internally?
   - What happens if a landlord wants to select a tenant who doesn’t fully meet your normal screening criteria?

10. **Lease Finalization and Move-In**
    - Who drafts the lease—do you use standardized templates, and how often are they customized?
    - At what point is the lease considered legally and internally “final”—after landlord sign-off, tenant sign-off, or a compliance review?
    - How do you coordinate the move-in date with contractors, cleaning, or any last-minute work that must be done before occupancy?

11. **Quality Checks, Compliance, and Audits**
    - At which stages do compliance officers and financial analysts get involved, and is their review mandatory for every property?
    - What are the main things compliance looks for regarding fair housing and regulatory adherence?
    - How do you handle situations where compliance or finance flags an issue after marketing has already begun or a tenant has been selected?
    - Are there periodic post-onboarding audits to see if properties still meet the criteria they were initially approved under?

12. **Roles and Responsibilities**
    - Can you outline, end-to-end, which role “owns” each major step (intake, documentation, inspection coordination, pricing, marketing, screening, lease signing)?
    - Where do you see the most overlap or confusion between roles (e.g., between property managers and leasing agents)?
    - If there’s a conflict between landlord preferences and internal policies, who has final decision authority?

13. **Timing, SLAs, and Bottlenecks**
    - What is your typical timeline from initial landlord contact to property activation, and what are your target SLAs?
    - Which steps most commonly cause delays, and why (e.g., landlord responsiveness, inspections, internal approvals)?
    - Do timelines differ significantly by region, property type, or landlord profile?

14. **Exception Handling and Special Cases**
    - How do you handle properties that require special insurance, certifications, or local permits beyond the standard set?
    - How are custom lease clauses reviewed and approved, and where do you draw the line on what you’re willing to include?
    - What is your process when a landlord pauses or withdraws mid-onboarding—do you archive the record, and how easily can it be reactivated?
    - Are there any rare but critical edge cases (e.g., legal disputes, problematic landlords, properties failing repeated inspections), and how are those managed?

15. **Communication and Tools**
    - Which tools handle which parts of communication (CRM, email, project management, internal chat), and how do you avoid information falling through the cracks?
    - Is there a single “source of truth” for the status of an onboarding, and who is responsible for keeping it updated?
    - How do you track approvals and decisions made via informal channels (e.g., phone calls, text messages) so they’re visible to the broader team?

16. **Measurement and Continuous Improvement**
    - What key metrics do you track around the onboarding process (e.g., time-to-activation, failure rate, landlord satisfaction)?
    - How do you gather feedback from landlords and internal teams about the onboarding experience?
    - Have you made any recent process changes, and what problems were those changes trying to solve?
