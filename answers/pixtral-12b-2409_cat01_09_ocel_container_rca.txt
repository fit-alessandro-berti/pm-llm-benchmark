Based on the provided process data and directly follows graph, here are some potential root causes for performance issues, focusing on process and data-specific considerations:

1. **High Duration in Event "Drive to Terminal" for Object Type: Container**
   - Duration: 10999.07 for "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal" and 84119.09 for "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck".
   - Root Cause: The extended duration suggests that the driving time between locations is significantly long, which could be due to long distances, traffic congestion, or inefficient routing.

2. **High Duration in Event "Order Empty Containers" for Object Type: Container**
   - Duration: 368943.92 for "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container".
   - Root Cause: This long duration might indicate inefficiencies in the process of ordering and picking up empty containers, such as delayed communications, slow response times, or coordination issues.

3. **High Duration in Event "Place in Stock" for Object Type: Container**
   - Duration: 743380.51 for "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay".
   - Root Cause: The extended duration suggests inefficiencies in stock management, possibly due to issues with space allocation, stock organization, or delays in the loading bay process.

4. **Imbalanced Object Frequencies for Object Type: Container**
   - "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" has 8559 events for 1896 objects, while "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal" has 1989 events for 1989 objects.
   - Root Cause: This imbalance might indicate that some trucks are repeatedly loaded without being driven to the terminal, suggesting potential inefficiencies in truck utilization or dispatching.

5. **High Frequency of repetitive events for Object Type: Vehicle and Forklift**
   - Multiple "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" and "Load to Vehicle" -> "Load to Vehicle" events with high frequencies and low object counts.
   - Root Cause: These repetitive events might indicate delays, inefficiencies, or rework within the process, such as vehicles or forklifts waiting idly or being rebooked due to errors or rescheduling.

6. **Long Duration in Event "Depart" for Object Type: Transport Document**
   - Duration: 1051301.41 for "Depart" -> "Depart".
   - Root Cause: This extended duration suggests significant delays or inefficiencies in the departure process, possibly due to coordination issues, customs procedures, or other delays at the departure point.

To address these issues, you might consider analyzing and optimizing the specific processes associated with these events, such as improving routing and scheduling for "Drive to Terminal", enhancing communication and coordination for "Order Empty Containers" and "Place in Stock", and investigating the causes of repetitive events and long durations in the "Depart" process.
