## Identified Temporal Anomalies

### 1. "Receive (R)" to "Approve (P)"  
- Average time of approximately 25 hours with an exceptionally low standard deviation (1 hour).  
- **Anomaly:** Unusually consistent timing suggests an artificial or system-driven scheduling rather than natural variability found in typical manual approval processes.

### 2. "Approve (P)" to "Notify (N)"  
- Very high average delay (7 days) with large variability (2 days).  
- **Anomaly:** A substantial gap indicates potential resource bottlenecks, manual processing backlogs, or inconsistent notification scheduling post-approval.

### 3. "Assign (A)" to "Close (C)"  
- Quick closure on average (around 2 hours) without consistently performing evaluation or approval.  
- **Anomaly:** Short durations suggest premature or incomplete claim handling, possibly skipping intermediary mandatory steps.

### 4. "Evaluate (E)" to "Notify (N)"  
- Extremely short (approx. 5 minutes) average time between evaluation and customer notification.  
- **Anomaly:** May indicate rushed evaluations, automatic notifications triggered immediately after evaluations, or possible omission of intermediate review steps.

## Hypotheses for Anomaly Causes:

### Anomaly 1: "Receive" to "Approve"
- An automated, time-triggered system may artificially schedule claim approvals at fixed intervals.
- Approvals might occur in bulk, driven by scheduled overnight processes rather than human evaluations, leading to consistent intervals.

### Anomaly 2: "Approve" to "Notify"
- Persistent manual processing backlogs at the notification step due to understaffing or workload peaks.
- Irregular resource availability or poor management of notification responsibilities, resulting in delayed or sporadic customer communications.

### Anomaly 3: "Assign" to "Close"
- Claims incorrectly closed immediately after assignment due to errors, fraudulent activity, or irregular handling.
- Certain cases incorrectly bypass evaluation and approval, possibly due to administrative shortcuts or incomplete documentation.

### Anomaly 4: "Evaluate" to "Notify"
- Automated notifications triggered immediately after evaluations, without additional quality control or management review.
- System misconfigurations or overly streamlined workflows causing short, potentially unsafe turnaround times.

## Proposed SQL Queries to Validate Hypotheses:

### 1. Investigate Claims with Unusually Consistent Approval Timing ("Receive" to "Approve"):

```sql
SELECT ce_r.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_p.timestamp - ce_r.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_between_R_and_P,
       ce_p.resource AS approving_resource
FROM claim_events ce_r
JOIN claim_events ce_p ON ce_r.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id
WHERE ce_r.activity = 'R'
  AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
ORDER BY hours_between_R_and_P;
```

- **Purpose:** Verify if the interval between Receive and Approve is consistently similar across multiple claims, and see if a particular resource (automated system, user, or batch job) processes these approvals.

---

### 2. Check Extended Delays Between "Approve" and "Notify":

```sql
SELECT ce_p.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_n.timestamp - ce_p.timestamp)) / 86400 AS days_between_P_and_N,
       ce_p.resource AS approver,
       ce_n.resource AS notifier,
       c.claim_type,
       adj.adjuster_id,
       adj.region
FROM claim_events ce_p
JOIN claim_events ce_n ON ce_p.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters adj ON adj.name = ce_p.resource
WHERE ce_p.activity = 'P'
  AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
ORDER BY days_between_P_and_N DESC;
```

- **Purpose:** Identify specific claims experiencing longest or varied delays post-approval. Determine if such delays correlate with certain claim types, adjusters, approvers, or regional resources.

---

### 3. Find Claims Closed Immediately after Assignment ("Assign" to "Close") Without Intermediate Steps:

```sql
SELECT ce_a.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_c.timestamp - ce_a.timestamp)) / 60 AS minutes_between_A_and_C,
       ce_a.resource AS assigning_resource,
       ce_c.resource AS closing_resource,
       c.claim_type
FROM claim_events ce_a
JOIN claim_events ce_c ON ce_a.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_e ON ce_e.claim_id = ce_a.claim_id AND ce_e.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_p ON ce_p.claim_id = ce_a.claim_id AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce_a.claim_id
WHERE ce_a.activity = 'A'
  AND ce_c.activity = 'C'
  AND ce_e.event_id IS NULL
  AND ce_p.event_id IS NULL
ORDER BY minutes_between_A_and_C ASC;
```

- **Purpose:** Confirm if these fast-closed claims systematically omit evaluation ("E") and approval ("P") processes, indicative of error-prone or non-standard handling procedures.

---

### 4. Review Rapid Notifications Following Evaluations ("Evaluate" to "Notify"):

```sql
SELECT ce_e.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_n.timestamp - ce_e.timestamp)) / 60 AS minutes_between_E_and_N,
       ce_e.resource AS evaluator,
       ce_n.resource AS notifier,
       c.claim_amount,
       c.claim_type
FROM claim_events ce_e
JOIN claim_events ce_n ON ce_e.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce_e.claim_id
WHERE ce_e.activity = 'E'
  AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
ORDER BY minutes_between_E_and_N ASC;
```

- **Purpose:** Determine if short intervals between evaluation and notifications correlate with specific evaluators, notifiers, claim amounts, or types, suggesting potentially skimped-quality control or overly automated processes.
