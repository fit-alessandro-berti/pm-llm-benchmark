It’s a BPMN 2.0 process map of an order-to-cash flow with four swimlanes: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. Dashed lines show message exchanges; solid arrows show the internal sequence of work. Key steps:

- Sales
  - Timer start “Monday morning.”
  - Expanded subprocess “Check customer’s order”: check order completeness; verify if the customer exists; if not, add the customer to a database.
  - Send order details to Production and Procurement.
  - Wait for a “Product sent” message.
  - Draft invoice and end.

- Production
  - Message start “Order details arrive.”
  - Plan production, then wait for a confirmation from Procurement that materials are “not faulty.”
  - Manufacture product.
  - Send a “Product complete” message to Warehouse.

- Procurement
  - Message start “Order details arrive.”
  - Expanded “Material Compensation Subprocess”: order materials with a compensation action “Return material.”
  - Check materials.
    - If OK, send “Material not faulty” to Production.
    - If not OK, send an “Order cancellation” message and end.

- Warehouse
  - Upon receiving “Product complete,” send the product to the customer.
  - Notify Sales with “Product sent.”

Overall, the diagram shows Sales initiating an order, Procurement sourcing and validating materials, Production building the product once materials are confirmed, Warehouse shipping it, and Sales invoicing after shipment; with an exception path where faulty materials trigger an order cancellation.
