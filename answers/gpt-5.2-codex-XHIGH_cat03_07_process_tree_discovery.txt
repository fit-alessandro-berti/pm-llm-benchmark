A concise processtree that fits the log and still captures the optional, repeatable “missinginfo / revalidation” behavior is:

```
-> (
    'Receive Application (RA)',
    'Validate Form (VF)',
    'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
    X(
        tau,
        ->(
            * ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', tau ),
            'Validate Form (VF)'
        )
    ),
    'Approval Decision (AD)',
    'Send Confirmation (SC)',
    'Archive Case (AC)'
)
```

**Reading:**  
- Main flow is a sequence: RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC.  
- After AE there is an **optional** branch: either skip (tau) or perform a loop of oneormore **RMI** actions, then a revalidation **VF**.  
- This allows traces with no missinginfo step, with one RMI, or with multiple RMI before revalidation, exactly as in the log.
