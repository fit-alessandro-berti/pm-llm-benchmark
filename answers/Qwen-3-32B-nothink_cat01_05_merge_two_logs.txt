# Merged Event Log Integration

## Analysis Approach

To merge these two event logs, I followed this strategy:
1. Match events by order_id and timestamp (within a 2-second tolerance)
2. Map similar event types between the two systems
3. Combine attributes from both logs where events match
4. Preserve unmatched events with origin indication
5. Sort all events chronologically

## Event Mapping Between Systems

I identified these event correspondences:
- "Order Received" in Log A  "OrderReceived" in Log B
- "Order Validated" in Log A  "OrderValidation" in Log B
- "Payment Processed" in Log A  "PaymentCheck" in Log B
- "Item Shipped" in Log A  "Shipping" in Log B
- "Item Delivered" in Log A - No direct match in Log B

## Final Merged Event Log

```
2023-10-10T09:59:58Z,Order Received,Order#1234,System A and B
    - user_id: u45
    - resource_id: r10
    - notes: "Event captured at warehouse system"

2023-10-10T10:01:29Z,Order Validated,Order#1234,System A and B
    - user_id: u12
    - resource_id: r10
    - notes: "Cross-check inventory"

2023-10-10T10:02:00Z,Payment Processed,Order#1234,System A
    - (No matching event in Log B at this exact timestamp)

2023-10-10T10:02:05Z,Payment Processed,Order#1234,System B
    - user_id: u12
    - resource_id: r99
    - notes: "Payment gateway delay"

2023-10-10T10:03:00Z,Quality Check,Order#1234,System B
    - user_id: u45
    - resource_id: r11
    - notes: "Random inspection"
    - (No matching event in Log A)

2023-10-10T10:05:00Z,Item Shipped,Order#1234,System A
    - (No matching event in Log B at this exact timestamp)

2023-10-10T10:05:02Z,Item Shipped,Order#1234,System B
    - user_id: u45
    - resource_id: r10
    - notes: "Package handed to courier"

2023-10-10T10:20:00Z,Item Delivered,Order#1234,System A
    - (No matching event in Log B)
```

## Reasoning for Decisions

1. **Timestamp Matching**:
   - I used a 2-second tolerance for matching events across logs
   - Events within this window were considered potential matches
   - For events with close but not identical timestamps, I included both records with their original timestamps

2. **Event Name Mapping**:
   - I mapped similar event names between systems (e.g., "Order Received" and "OrderReceived")
   - When events had similar names and timestamps, I merged them into a single record with both systems marked as source
   - Events with significantly different names or no close timestamp match were kept separate

3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - For events with slightly different timestamps (like Payment Processed and Item Shipped), I included both records with their original timestamps
   - For events with missing attributes in one log, I only included the attributes that were available
   - I prioritized including all available information rather than making assumptions about missing data

4. **Handling Non-Matching Events**:
   - The "Quality Check" event in Log B had no match in Log A and was included as-is
   - The "Item Delivered" event in Log A had no match in Log B and was included as-is
   - The Payment Processed and Item Shipped events had close timestamps but weren't identical, so both were included

5. **Chronological Order**:
   - I sorted all events by timestamp, using the primary timestamps from each log
   - For merged events, I used the earliest timestamp as the record's time

This merged log provides a more complete picture of the order fulfillment process by combining the basic timeline from System A with the richer attributes from System B, while being transparent about where events came from and when they couldn't be confidently matched.
