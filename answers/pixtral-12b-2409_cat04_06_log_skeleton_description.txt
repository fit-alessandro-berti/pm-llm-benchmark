Based on the declarative constraints provided, we can describe the underlying process as follows:

### General Flow
The process appears to be a workflow for handling declarations, approvals, and payments, involving various roles such as EMPLOYEE, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR, and ADMINISTRATION. The activities can result in either approvals or rejections at different stages.

### Activities and Their Occurrences
1. **Submission:**
   - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` can occur multiple times (0 to 7).

2. **Approvals:**
   - `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION` can occur up to 4 times.
   - `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` can occur up to 4 times.
   - `Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER` can occur up to 2 times.

3. **Payments:**
   - `Request Payment` can occur once or not at all.
   - `Payment Handled` can occur once or not at all.

4. **Rejections:**
   - Rejections can come from different roles and can occur multiple times:
     - `Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`: up to 6 times.
     - `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`: up to 6 times.
     - `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`: up to 2 times.
     - `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`: up to 3 times.
     - `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`: up to 3 times.
     - `Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`: up to 2 times.

5. **Other Activities:**
   - `Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE` can occur once or not at all.

### Relationships and Constraints
1. **Equivalence:**
   - Certain declarations are considered equivalent, meaning they represent the same outcome.
   - Examples:
     - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' is equivalent to both 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER'.
     - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' is equivalent to 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.

2. **Always Before:**
   - If a declaration is made by a SUPERVISOR or PRE_APPROVER, the declaration must have been submitted by the EMPLOYEE previously.
   - Examples:
     - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')
     - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')

3. **Always After:**
   - If a declaration is rejected by PRE_APPROVER, then it must be handled by MISSING.
   - Examples:
     - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')

4. **Never Together:**
   - Certain activities cannot occur in the same case.
   - Examples:
     - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION')
     - ('Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE')

5. **Directly-Follows:**
   - Specific activities must follow immediately after certain declarations.
   - Examples:
     - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')
     - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')
     - ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')

### Summary
The process involves multiple roles in handling declarations, which can result in approvals or rejections. Rejections can happen at different stages, and certain activities must occur in a specific order or cannot co-exist in the same case. The constraints guide the sequence and conditions under which activities can occur, ensuring proper workflow management.
