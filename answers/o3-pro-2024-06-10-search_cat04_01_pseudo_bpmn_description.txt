Detailed Walk-through of the Pseudo-BPMN Process
================================================

1. Start Event  
   • Marks the moment a customer request (order, quote inquiry, etc.) is received and the process officially begins.

2. Task A – “Receive Customer Request”  
   • Operational activity in which customer data and specifications are captured (channelagnostic: web form, e-mail, phone, etc.).  
   • Output: a structured request record handed to the first decision gateway.

3. Gateway 1 (XOR) – “Check Request Type”  
   • Exclusive-OR: exactly one outgoing path is taken.  
   • Branches:  
     a. Standard request path (most common, no customization).  
     b. Custom request path (requires tailoring or engineering effort).


STANDARD REQUEST PATH


4. Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”  
   • Verifies that the product/service code exists, the customer is in good standing, required fields are filled, etc.

5. Gateway 2 (AND) – “Run Parallel Checks”  
   • Parallel (AND-split): both branches launch simultaneously.  
     • Task C1 – “Credit Check” – confirms credit limit, outstanding balance, risk score.  
     • Task C2 – “Inventory Check” – verifies stock, allocates inventory.

6. Parallel Join (AND-join) – “All Parallel Checks Completed”  
   • Waits for both C1 and C2 to finish; synchronizes before moving on.

7. Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”  
   • Uses results of inventory allocation, shipping calendars, service-level agreements, etc., to calculate a realistic delivery or service date.


CUSTOM REQUEST PATH


4. Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
   • Engineering/solution team estimates technical feasibility, lead time, material availability, required approvals, cost drivers.

5. Gateway 3 (XOR) – “Is Customization Feasible?”  
   • If “Yes”:  
       • Task E1 – “Prepare Custom Quotation” – builds a price quote, lead time, and scope of work.  
   • If “No”:  
       • Task E2 – “Send Rejection Notice” – informs customer that the request cannot be fulfilled; process ends for this case (End Event reached straight from E2).


COMMON POST-ANALYSIS FLOW (applies after D or E1)


8. Gateway 4 (XOR) – “Is Approval Needed?”  
   • Business rules decide: high order value, thin margins, strategic client, or custom work may require managerial sign-off.  
   • If “No Approval Needed”, the process jumps directly to Task G (invoice generation).  
   • If “Yes”, continue to Task F.

9. Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval”  
   • Could involve a digital approval workflow or physical signature.

10. Gateway 5 (XOR) – “Is Approval Granted?”  
    • If “Yes”: proceed to Task G.  
    • If “No”:  
        • Task H – “Re-evaluate Conditions” – analyzes why approval failed (e.g., pricing too low, risks too high).  
        • Loop logic:  
            – For a custom order, H routes back to Task E1 (prepare a revised quotation).  
            – For a standard order, H routes back to Task D (recalculate delivery date, possibly after altering quantities, lead times, or pricing).  
        • This loop continues until approval is obtained or the order is abandoned.

11. Task G – “Generate Final Invoice”  
    • Creates the binding commercial document (invoice or formal quotation).  
    • Pulls final price, taxes, delivery date, terms & conditions.

12. Task I – “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
    • Combines invoice/quotation with confirmation of acceptance, delivery promise, next-steps. Often automated e-mail or customer portal update.

13. End Event  
    • Signals the formal completion of the salesorder initiation cycle (order now ready for fulfillment).

Key Concepts & Gateway Behavior
--------------------------------

• XOR Gateway: Only one outgoing path may be taken; used for “either/or” business rules (request type, feasibility decision, approval result).  
• AND Gateway (split): Launches multiple tasks in parallel; downstream AND join synchronizes them.  
• AND Gateway (join): Waits for all incoming flows; ensures prerequisites are met before continuation.  
• Loopback Arcs: Implement iterative refinement when manager approval is denied—maintains process integrity by forcing rework at the correct stage (quotation or delivery calculation) instead of starting the entire process anew.

Differences Between Standard and Custom Requests
------------------------------------------------

Standard request:  
• Validated quickly (Task B1).  
• Objective data-driven checks (credit, inventory) executed in parallel.  
• Delivery date calculation (Task D) is deterministic once stock and credit are confirmed.  
• Typically lower probability of requiring manager approval unless value is exceptional.

Custom request:  
• Requires feasibility study (Task B2) that embeds engineering and cost modeling.  
• May be declared infeasible, terminating the process early (E2).  
• Produces a custom quotation (E1) that is more likely to trigger the “approval needed” branch due to higher risk/complexity.  
• On approval rejection, rework returns to quotation preparation instead of delivery calculation.

Triggers for Approvals & Rework
-------------------------------

Approval Needed (Gateway 4) is usually triggered by one or more policy rules:  
• Order value exceeds threshold X.  
• Gross margin below threshold Y.  
• Strategic account rules (key customer discounts).  
• Custom engineering involvement.  
• Any exception flagged during validation.

Approval Granted? (Gateway 5) may be denied when:  
• Risk exceeds tolerance (credit, technical, legal, compliance).  
• Financial terms unsatisfactory.  
• Capacity conflicts.

If denied, Task H ensures the process owner adjusts parameters (pricing, quantities, schedule, or design) and loops back to the right preparation task (D or E1) so that only the affected calculations are redone.

How Paths Converge
------------------

• Parallel branch convergence: AND-join after C1 and C2.  
• Scenario convergence: Both the standard (after D) and custom (after E1) paths merge at Gateway 4, allowing the same approval logic to be reused.  
• Final convergence: Regardless of how the invoice is produced, all paths unite at Task I before hitting the End Event, guaranteeing every successful order ends with customer confirmation.

This end-to-end description should help any reader map each activity to its purpose, understand decision logic, and see how iterative loops maintain compliance without restarting the entire workflow.
