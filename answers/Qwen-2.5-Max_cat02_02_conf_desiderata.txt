### **Analysis of the Event Log**

---

### **1. Normative Rule Violations**
Normative rules define strict constraints that must be followed. Any deviation from these rules constitutes a serious violation.

#### **Case 1:**
- **Sequence:**  
  - Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case  
- **Evaluation:**  
  - The sequence strictly adheres to the normative rules.  
  - No violations detected.  

**Conclusion:** **No normative violations in Case 1.**

---

#### **Case 2:**
- **Sequence:**  
  - Application Received → Risk Assessment → Credit Check → Loan Decision (Rejected) → Finalize Documentation → Close Case  
- **Violations Identified:**  
  1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:**  
     - Risk Assessment occurred at `2024-01-11 08:20`, but Credit Check was not performed until `2024-01-11 09:00`.  
     - **Violation:** Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.  
  2. **Finalizing Documentation after Rejection:**  
     - Loan Decision was "Rejected" at `2024-01-11 09:30`, but Finalize Documentation occurred at `2024-01-11 10:00`.  
     - **Violation:** Documentation must not be finalized if the loan is rejected.  

**Conclusion:** **Case 2 violates two normative rules.**

---

#### **Case 3:**
- **Sequence:**  
  - Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case  
- **Evaluation:**  
  - The sequence adheres to the normative rules.  
  - No violations detected.  

**Conclusion:** **No normative violations in Case 3.**

---

### **2. Desiderata Violations**
Desiderata represent recommended best practices. While deviations are not severe, they indicate suboptimal behavior.

#### **Case 1:**
- **Timing Analysis:**  
  - Credit Check: Completed within 30 minutes of receiving the application (`2024-01-10 09:00` to `2024-01-10 09:30`).  
    - **Compliant:** Within the 24-hour desideratum.  
  - Inform Applicant: Completed 2 hours after the Loan Decision (`2024-01-10 11:00` to `2024-01-10 13:00`).  
    - **Compliant:** Within the 48-hour desideratum.  
  - Follow-up Call: Not performed.  
    - **Suboptimal:** Missing the recommended follow-up call.  

**Conclusion:** **Case 1 fails to meet one desideratum (missing follow-up call).**

---

#### **Case 2:**
- **Timing Analysis:**  
  - Credit Check: Completed 40 minutes after receiving the application (`2024-01-11 08:00` to `2024-01-11 09:00`).  
    - **Compliant:** Within the 24-hour desideratum.  
  - Inform Applicant: Not applicable since the loan was rejected.  
  - Follow-up Call: Not performed.  
    - **Suboptimal:** Missing the recommended follow-up call.  

**Conclusion:** **Case 2 fails to meet one desideratum (missing follow-up call).**

---

#### **Case 3:**
- **Timing Analysis:**  
  - Credit Check: Completed 4 days after receiving the application (`2024-01-12 09:00` to `2024-01-14 10:00`).  
    - **Violation:** Exceeds the 24-hour desideratum.  
  - Inform Applicant: Completed 2 days and 3 hours after the Loan Decision (`2024-01-14 12:00` to `2024-01-16 15:00`).  
    - **Violation:** Exceeds the 48-hour desideratum.  
  - Follow-up Call: Not performed.  
    - **Suboptimal:** Missing the recommended follow-up call.  

**Conclusion:** **Case 3 fails to meet three desiderata (delayed Credit Check, delayed Inform Applicant, missing follow-up call).**

### **3. Interpretations and Justifications**
#### **Case 2:**
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:**  
  - Possible justification: A clerical error or misunderstanding of the process sequence. This could indicate insufficient training or oversight.  
- **Finalizing Documentation after Rejection:**  
  - Possible justification: An administrative oversight or miscommunication about the rejection decision.  

#### **Case 3:**
- **Delayed Credit Check:**  
  - Possible justification: High workload or resource constraints may have caused delays.  
- **Delayed Inform Applicant:**  
  - Possible justification: Bottlenecks in communication or manual processing errors.  
- **Missing Follow-up Calls (All Cases):**  
  - Possible justification: Lack of emphasis on this step in the workflow or competing priorities.

### **Final Recommendations**
1. **For Normative Violations:**  
   - Enforce stricter adherence to the required sequence using automated workflow systems or checklists.  
   - Provide additional training to staff on process rules.  

2. **For Desiderata Violations:**  
   - Implement reminders or alerts for time-sensitive tasks (e.g., Credit Check within 24 hours).  
   - Encourage follow-up calls by integrating them into the standard workflow.  

By addressing these issues, the process can achieve both compliance and optimal performance.  

**Final Answer:**
- **Normative Violations:** Cases 2 only.
- **Desiderata Violations:** Cases 1, 2, and 3.
