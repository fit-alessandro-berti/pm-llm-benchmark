### Integrated Event Log (Case ID = `order_id`)
Assumptions:
- One **“Item Picked”** event is created **per order line** (because picking timestamps/resources differ).
- One **“Order Dispatched”** and one **“Order Arrived”** event is created **per delivery record** (split shipments become multiple dispatch/arrival events).
- **Payments** are linked to cases via `invoice_id -> Invoice.order_id`.
- **Resource** is resolved from the Resources table where available; otherwise the raw ID is used.
- All timestamps are already in UTC (`Z`) and are used as-is.

If you want, I can also provide:
- a **CSV-ready** version of this log,
- a **flattened “case attributes” table** (one row per order_id),
- or alternative event granularity (e.g., one aggregated “All Items Picked” per order).
