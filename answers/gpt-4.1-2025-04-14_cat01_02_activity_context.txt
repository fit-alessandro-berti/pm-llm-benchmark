Let's tackle the task step by step:

---

## **Step 1: Identify Activities With Multiple Occurrences and Contextual Differences**

By scanning the log, we notice:

- **"Verify Documents"** occurs more than once in C001 and C003.
  - The first occurrence refers to initial checks.
  - Subsequent occurrences are *after* some customer correction/upload or after internal adjustment—implying re-verification or follow-up checks.

- **"Call Customer"** occurs more than once in C002.
  - The first call is for clarifying a discrepancy.
  - The second is to confirm the adjustments made.

**Other activities are unique in each case or only repeat across cases (such as "Initiate Request", "Adjust Account", "Approve Request"), and do not require disambiguation.**

---

## **Step 2: Design Disambiguated Activity Names**

### 1. **Verify Documents**
- **First Occurrence:** "Initial Document Verification"
- **Second Occurrence(s):**
    - If after missing docs provided  "Document Re-Verification (After Customer Submission)"
    - If after internal account adjustment  "Document Re-Verification (Post Account Adjustment)"

### 2. **Call Customer**
- **First Occurrence:**
    - If to request documents  "Request Missing Documents Call"
    - If to clarify discrepancy  "Clarify Account Discrepancy Call"
    - If to have customer return  "Recall Customer Call"
- **Second Occurrence:**
    - If for follow up  "Confirm Adjustment Call"

## **Step 3: Present the Revised Event Log**

## **Step 4: Justification of Naming Choices**

- **"Initial Document Verification":** Used for the first document check in any case, regardless of channel (online/branch), making clear it's the primary verification step.
- **"Document Re-Verification (After Customer Submission)":** Indicates a repeated verification triggered by the customer submitting additional/missing documents.
- **"Document Re-Verification (Post Account Adjustment)":** Used after internal changes, to indicate re-checking of documents in light of new or corrected account information.
- **"Request Missing Documents Call":** Clarifies that the call was specifically to request further documentation from the customer.
- **"Clarify Account Discrepancy Call":** Details that the call purpose was to investigate an account issue, not related directly to documentation.
- **"Confirm Adjustment Call":** Implies a call with the customer to verify changes made to the account.
- **"Recall Customer Call":** Explicitly shows this is a customer recall after leaving the branch, not related to documents or account adjustments.

These choices disambiguate the process steps and clarify intent and triggers for each action, reducing ambiguity for further analysis or process improvement.
