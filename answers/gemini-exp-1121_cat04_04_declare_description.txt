Let's break down the process described by these constraints. The core activities are:

*   **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:** An employee submits a declaration.
*   **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR:**  A supervisor gives final approval.
*   **Request Payment:** A payment is requested.
*   **Payment Handled:**  The payment is processed.

Here's the process flow based on the constraints:

1. **Initialization:** The process always begins with the "**Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**".

2. **Mandatory Steps:** The constraints indicate that  **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**, **Declaration FINAL\_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**, **Request Payment**, and **Payment Handled**  activities  *must exist* and each of them should occur *exactly once*.

3. **Sequential Ordering:**
    *   The strongest ordering constraints are the *chain succession* and *chain precedence* constraints. They tell us that the following sequence must occur: **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**  -> **Declaration FINAL\_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled.**  This is further reinforced by the alternate and normal *succession* and *precedence* constraints.
    *   All the *response* constraints confirm this sequential order: if an activity occurs, then the next one in the sequence must also occur.

4. **Strict Alternation:** The *alternate response*, *alternate precedence*, and *alternate succession* constraints strengthen the sequential ordering. They indicate that these activities should strictly alternate without any repetitions. For example, we won't see two "Request Payment" activities in a row.

5. **Co-Existence:** The co-existence constraints emphasize that all four core activities are tightly coupled. If any of them occur, the others must also occur within the same trace.

6. **Absence of Activities:**  The constraints explicitly state the absence of several activities related to rejection, pre-approval, administration approval, saving, and budget owner approval. This suggests a simplified process where the declaration goes directly from employee submission to supervisor approval and then to payment.

**In summary, the declarative process model describes a straightforward reimbursement or payment process:**

1. An employee submits a declaration.
2. The declaration is finally approved by a supervisor.
3. A payment request is initiated.
4. The payment is handled.

The process is linear, with each step occurring exactly once in a strict order. There are no rejection or intermediary approval steps involved, according to this model.
