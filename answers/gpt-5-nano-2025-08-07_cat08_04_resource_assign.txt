Below is a structured, data-driven plan to analyze TechSolve’s resource assignment practices using process mining and to propose concrete optimization strategies. The plan uses the available incident event log and focuses on extracting actionable insights about how resources (agents) and tiers (L1/L2/L3) are actually being assigned, how handovers occur, and how skills are used.

1) Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

A. What to analyze in the event log (and why)

- Agent- and tier-level workload and throughput
  - Metrics: number of tickets handled per agent and per tier, days/hours worked vs. tickets processed, distribution skew (Gini or variance), and peak-load periods.
  - Why: reveal under/over-utilization, workload imbalances, and times when SLAs are at risk due to capacity constraints.

- Processing times and cycle times
  - Metrics:
    - Start-to-End times per ticket (overall cycle time)
    - Per-stage times (L1 Start to End, L2 Start to End, L3 Start to End)
    - Time-in-queue before first action (time from Ticket Created to first Assignment)
  - Why: identify where delays accumulate (e.g., long wait to assign, slow L2/L3 processing, or bottlenecks around handovers).

- First-call resolution (FCR) and first-line effectiveness
  - Metrics: FCR rate at L1 (tickets closed at L1 without escalation), average L1 handling time for those resolved at L1.
  - Why: measure L1 effectiveness and identify opportunities to empower L1 with more guided resolution steps or decision support.

- Skill usage and skill match
  - Metrics: for each ticket, whether the Required Skill matches any agent’s documented Skill; share of tickets assigned to agents with the exact required skill vs. those with partial or no match; time-to-fill skill gaps (how long it takes to bring a case to a skilled agent through escalation).
  - Why: quantify whether specialized skills are being used appropriately or if specialists are routinely handling tasks below their skill level.

- Reassignments, escalations, and handovers
  - Metrics:
    - Number of reassignments per ticket
    - Time between successive reassignments
    - Escalation count and time-to-escalation
    - Who initiates handovers (L1 to L2, L2 to L3, dispatcher interventions)
  - Why: quantify the “handover cost” and identify unnecessary reassignments or unnecessary escalations that waste time.

- Route and interaction patterns (process paths)
  - Metrics: typical end-to-end traces (from Ticket Created to final resolution) and their frequencies; time spent on each path segment.
  - Why: detect common but suboptimal paths (e.g., many tickets looping between L1 and L2 without progress).

- Category/priority vs. skill alignment
  - Metrics: accuracy of initial skill requirement tags by category and priority; mismatches between ticket characteristics and assigned skill sets.
  - Why: reveal mislabeling or misrouting that causes delays or escalations.

B. How to apply process mining techniques to reveal actual assignment patterns (vs. intended logic)

- Process discovery (Inductive/Heuristic) on traces
  - Build traces for end-to-end incident handling, including the sequence of activities and the agent/tier involved.
  - Outcome: discover the actual end-to-end process model, including typical paths, parallel handling, loops, and where handovers occur.
  - Compare with intended process model (as documented by SOPs) to identify deviations such as unexpected escalations, bypasses, or redundant steps.

- Resource-centered analysis (resource interaction)
  - Create traces focused on resources (agents) to see who tends to be involved at which stages and where handovers originate/terminate.
  - Metrics: average handover count per ticket, average time spent in each handover, and hot spots where many handovers occur.
  - Outcome: identify bottlenecks caused by poor handoff practices or misalignment of agent strengths with ticket needs.

- Social network analysis (SNA) of handovers
  - Build a handover network where nodes are agents (or tiers) and edges represent handovers (with weight by frequency or time).
  - Metrics: degree centrality, betweenness, closeness, clustering coefficient, and bottleneck nodes.
  - Outcome: uncover “super connectors” who act as bottlenecks or single points of failure, and detect fragmented collaboration patterns.

- Role discovery / skill utilization analysis
  - Use clustering on agent skill vectors and observed activities to see if agents’ roles align with official tiers and job descriptions.
  - Outcome: reveal gaps where a supposed L2/L3 specialist frequently handles L1-like tasks or vice versa.

- Variant analysis and decision mining
  - Variant analysis: categorize tickets by the number of handovers, reassignments, or escalations; compare “smooth” cases vs “problematic” cases.
  - Decision mining: extract decision rules used at key points (e.g., at assignment or escalation points). For instance, rules like “if ticket category is X and required skill is Y and L1 queue length is high, escalate to L2 with skill Z.”
  - Outcome: expose the practical decision logic managers and dispatchers actually use, and identify where it diverges from best practice.

- Skill utilization analysis (quantitative and narrative)
  - Compare ticket requirements to agent skill sets on the traces to measure whether skills are being used as intended.
  - Outcome: quantify underutilization of specialists and identify opportunities for cross-skilling or better routing.

C. How to evaluate current assignment logic vs. mined patterns

- Compare the current policy (round-robin within tiers plus manual escalation) with mined models to quantify gaps:
  - Proportion of tickets routed to a non-best-fit skill relative to the skill-match rate.
  - Amount of time tickets spend in queues due to mismatched routing.
  - Frequency and impact of escalations that could have been prevented with better initial routing.

2) Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

A. Pinpointing resource-related problems (examples and how to detect them)

- Insufficient availability of skills
  - Detection: low coverage rate for required skills, long wait times for tickets requiring rare skills, high time-to-assign for such tickets.
  - Indicator examples: SLA breaches concentrated in categories requiring specialized skills; high average time-to-resolution for those tickets.

- Excessive and unnecessary reassignments/escalations
  - Detection: high average number of reassignments per ticket; long cumulative time spent in handovers; correlation with SLA breaches.
  - Indicator examples: tickets with multiple handovers have significantly longer cycle times and higher breach rates.

- Incorrect initial assignments by L1 or dispatchers
  - Detection: low skill-match rate on initial assignments; large share of escalations shortly after initial assignment.
  - Indicator examples: tickets routed to L1 with high mismatch for required skill; high initial assignment time before escalation.

- Underperforming or overloaded agents/teams
  - Detection: sustained high utilization (> target) for certain agents or teams; low FCR or long cycle times for those agents.
  - Indicator examples: a core group of agents handle disproportionately many high-priority tickets with poor outcomes.

- SLA breach correlations
  - Detection: cross-tab analysis showing higher breach rates for tickets with specific patterns (e.g., certain handover chains, certain categories, or certain initial assignments).
  - Indicator examples: P2/P3 breaches correlate with high handover counts or with escalations that occur after a long wait.

B. How to quantify impact (where possible)

- Average delay per reassignment
  - Calculation: difference in time from one assignment to the next for tickets that were reassigned, averaged across tickets.

- Percentage of SLA breaches linked to skill mismatch
  - Calculation: proportion of breached tickets where the initial or subsequent assignment lacked the required skill match (based on log data).

- Impact of initial misrouting on SLA
  - Calculation: SLA breach rate for tickets that started with a non-matching skill versus those that started with a matching skill.

- Utilization-drift and backlog growth
  - Calculation: change in agent utilization over time and its relationship to backlog growth, especially during peak periods.

- Escalation-related delay
  - Calculation: average time-to-escalation and post-escalation resolution time; contribution of escalations to overall cycle time.

3) Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

A. Potential root causes to explore (with process mining lenses)

- Deficiencies in the assignment rules
  - Pure round-robin and ad hoc escalation decisions ignore both skill requirements and real-time workload.

- Incomplete or inaccurate agent skill profiles
  - Skill tags not updated after training; mismatch between documented skills and actual capabilities; untracked cross-training.

- Poor initial ticket categorization or skill requirement tagging
  - Mislabeling causes the wrong skill to be considered, leading to misrouting and escalations.

- Lack of real-time visibility into workload and availability
  - Dispatchers and L1 may not see updated queue lengths, agent availability, or current workload, causing suboptimal routing.

- Insufficient empowerment or training for L1 agents
  - If L1 lacks authority or decision support to resolve certain issues, escalations become more frequent and faster to escalate.

B. How variant analysis and decision mining help

- Variant analysis
  - By contrasting smooth-running cases (few handovers, quick resolution) with problematic cases (many handovers, delays), you can identify what patterns lead to success vs failure.

- Decision mining
  - Extract explicit rules or decision criteria used (or implicitly followed) at assignment/escalation points. This reveals whether decisions align with policy or rely on ad-hoc judgment.

C. Data quality and process issues to check

- Completeness and accuracy of skill fields (Agent Skills, Required Skill)
- Consistency and timeliness of logs (timestamps, event types)
- Capture of dispatcher actions and rationale (e.g., why a ticket was reassigned)
- Channel and context data (Phone/Web/Portal) to understand context of escalation triggers

4) Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

Below are at least three concrete strategies. Each is grounded in the insights you’d gain from process mining and is designed to improve SLA compliance, reduce rework, and better utilize agent skills.

Strategy A: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting (SBR-PW)

- The issue it addresses
  - Mismatches between ticket requirements and assigned agent skills; underutilization of specialized skills; avoidable escalations.

- How mining informs it
  - Use historical skill-match rates, category-specific skill needs, and agent proficiency profiles to assign tickets to the best-fit agent. Incorporate measurable proficiency weights (e.g., 1.0 for expert, 0.8 for strong, 0.5 for basic) and a safety margin for urgent cases.

- Data required
  - Up-to-date skill taxonomy per agent and per skill, proficiency levels, real-time agent availability, ticket required skill, category, priority, and historical outcomes by skill matches.

- Implementation outline
  - Define skill match scoring: Score = agent proficiency for required skill × factor for urgency plus a small penalty for current workload. Assign to the agent with the highest score who is available and not overutilized.
  - Implement fallback rules: if no strong match is available, route to best available match with integrated escalation guidance.

- Expected benefits
  - Higher first-contact resolution, fewer escalations, shorter time-to-resolution for skilled tasks, and better utilization of specialized staff.

Strategy B: Workload-Aware Assignment with SLA-Aware Queuing

- The issue it addresses
  - Uneven workload distribution and queues that grow during peak periods, causing SLA risk.

- How mining informs it
  - Use queue lengths, agent workloads, and per-ticket SLA urgency to balance assignment. Identify agents who are near capacity and redistribute tasks to prevent bottlenecks.

- Data required
  - Real-time and historical queue lengths by category; per-agent current workload and capacity; SLA targets by priority; historical processing times by tier and category.

- Implementation outline
  - Develop a dynamic assignment heuristic that selects the agent with the lowest projected SLA breach risk given current queue lengths and workload. Include “buffer” capacity for critical P1/P2 tickets.
  - Implement queue-aware routing when dispatchers assign tickets or when L1 selects to escalate.

- Expected benefits
  - More even workload distribution, reduced queueing time, lower SLA breach rate, and improved predictability.

Strategy C: Predictive Assignment for Ticket Characteristics

- The issue it addresses
  - Uncertainty about required skills and complexity leading to misrouting.

- How mining informs it
  - Build predictive models (e.g., lightweight classifiers) that estimate required skill and complexity from ticket features (category, keywords, channel, notes) using historical labeled data.

- Data required
  - Historical tickets with features: category, priority, keywords, initial notes, and the actual skills used successfully in resolution; outcome labels (time to resolve, escalation, FCR).

- Implementation outline
  - Deploy a lightweight predictor at ticket creation or first triage. Route to the agent or pool of agents with the highest predicted skill alignment and lowest estimated time-to-resolve, with fallback to L1 if uncertainty is high.
  - Periodically retrain the model with new outcomes to adapt to changing patterns.

- Expected benefits
  - Reduced misrouting, faster initial routing to right skill, fewer escalations, and improved SLA performance for mid- and high-priority tickets.

Strategy D: Refined Escalation Criteria and Decision Support for L1

- The issue it addresses
  - Excessive or premature escalations due to lack of empowerment or ambiguous escalation criteria.

- How mining informs it
  - Identify cases where L1 resolutions were successful vs. those escalated; derive decision rules (e.g., if a ticket remains unresolved after X minutes with certain symptoms, escalate; otherwise attempt structured workaround steps).

- Data required
  - Historical success/failure rates at L1 by category and skill, time-to-resolution at L1, and outcomes post-escalation.

- Implementation outline
  - Create a decision matrix and decision support prompts for L1 with recommended actions and when to escalate. Provide L1 with guided runbooks and quick-access knowledge for common categories.

- Expected benefits
  - Lower escalation rates for routine issues, faster turnarounds for simple problems, and improved L1 confidence and performance.

Strategy E: Dynamic Cross-Tier Resource Reallocation

- The issue it addresses
  - Rigid tier boundaries and underutilization during varying demand across tiers.

- How mining informs it
  - Identify periods when L1 queues spike but L2/L3 have capacity, or vice versa; model cross-training opportunities and safe reallocation windows.

- Data required
  - Historical cross-tier handling times, skill cross-coverage capabilities, and success metrics when reallocation occurred.

- Implementation outline
  - Create a policy to permit temporary, monitored reallocation of trained L1 and L2 staff to alleviate spikes, with clear limits and rollback criteria. Maintain a pool of staff with cross-training to ensure coverage without compromising expertise elsewhere.

- Expected benefits
  - Improved responsiveness during demand surges, reduced backlog growth, and better SLA adherence during peak periods.

Note: The strategies above are not mutually exclusive. A phased combination (e.g., Strategy A + B for baseline routing and workload balance, plus Strategy C for predictive triage, and Strategy D for improved escalation) often yields the best outcomes.

5) Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

A. Simulation to evaluate proposed strategies before implementation

- Modeling approach
  - Build a discrete-event simulation (DES) or agent-based model (ABM) that mirrors the end-to-end incident handling process as discovered by process mining.
  - Include agents with skills, proficiency, and current workloads; include queues by category/priority; model dispatchers and escalation logic; simulate ticket inflow patterns (seasonality, daily peaks).

- Use of mined process models
  - Use the discovered process flows as the baseline process to simulate current performance.
  - Integrate proposed strategies as policy modules (routing rules, escalation policies, cross-tier reallocation logic) and run scenarios.

- What to compare
  - Key outcomes: average resolution time, SLA breach rate, FCR rate, handover counts, and utilization metrics under each scenario.
  - Sensitivity analyses: test different queue lengths, skill coverage levels, and surge conditions.

- Validation
  - Calibrate the model with historical data (e.g., last 3–6 months) to ensure fidelity; validate results against known outcomes for a subset of tickets.

B. Implementation plan (phased)

- Phase 1: Pilot on a subset of categories or a specific period (e.g., one priority band or one channel). Implement one strategy (e.g., Skill-Based Routing) and measure impact.
- Phase 2: Expand to additional categories and add workload-aware routing if Phase 1 shows benefits.
- Phase 3: Introduce predictive assignment and enhanced escalation guidelines, with continuous monitoring.
- Phase 4: Optional dynamic cross-tier reallocation for peak periods, after ensuring training and safeguards.

C. Monitoring effectiveness post-implementation

- Process mining dashboards and views to maintain continuous visibility:
  - Resource and workload dashboards
    - Agent utilization: actual vs target, by tier
    - Task distribution by skill and category
    - Queue lengths and aging by priority/category
  - Process performance dashboards
    - End-to-end cycle time by ticket path (including handovers)
    - SLA breach rate by priority and category
    - FCR rate by tier and by skill match
    - Reassignment and escalation metrics (counts, timing, and outcomes)
  - Skill utilization dashboards
    - Skill match rate (required vs assigned)
    - Specialist workload and cross-skill usage
  - Handover and network dashboards (SNA)
    - Handover frequency and duration per agent
    - Key bottleneck nodes in the handover network
  - Variant dashboards
    - Compare “smooth” vs “reassignment-heavy” variants to assess strategy impact and identify new improvement opportunities

- Data streams and refresh cadence
  - Near real-time ingestion for operator dashboards (e.g., every 5–15 minutes for queues, availability, and ongoing tickets).
  - Daily or weekly process-mersistent dashboards for longer-term trends (cycle times, SLA adherence, skill-utilization patterns).

- KPIs to track long-term
  - SLA breach rate by priority and category
  - Overall first-contact resolution rate
  - Average number of handovers per ticket
  - Average time spent in handovers
  - Agent utilization and workload balance (variance across agents)
  - Skill utilization rate and underutilization of specialists
  - Accuracy of initial skill routing (percentage of tickets matched to required skill on first assignment)

Data preparation and quality notes

- Ensure a consistent taxonomies for:
  - Ticket Priority (P1–P4), Categories (Hardware, OS, App, Network, Security, Access Management, etc.)
  - Required Skill vs Agent Skill (e.g., Networking-Firewall, OS-WindowsServer, App-CRM, DB-SQL, Security-IAM)
  - Agent Tiers (L1, L2, L3) and real-time availability
- Normalize timestamps across activities to a common time zone and ensure proper sequencing (ticket creation, assignment, start, end, escalations, reassignments, and closures).
- Address data quality gaps:
  - Missing skill tags or mislabeling: use natural language processing on ticket notes to infer likely required skills and compare with logged Required Skill.
  - Missing or inconsistent dispatcher actions: fill gaps with inferred decisions from adjacent events; add qualitative notes where possible.
- Build a skill provenance layer to track training status and updates to agent skills (prior training events, certifications, etc.) so that skill utilization reflects current capabilities.

Summary of expected benefits

- Improved alignment of assignments with actual skill needs, reducing misroutes and escalations.
- More balanced workloads across agents and tiers, reducing burnout and SLA risk during peak periods.
- Reduced reassignments and handovers, lowering end-to-end cycle times and improving FCR.
- Data-driven decision support for dispatchers and managers, with a clear link between process patterns, resource allocation decisions, and outcomes.
- A repeatable, auditable process for continuous improvement through ongoing process mining, simulation, and KPI monitoring.

If you’d like, I can tailor the above plan to TechSolve’s actual log format (mapping field names to your schema), draft a concrete set of metrics with target thresholds, and sketch a minimal viable dashboard design for the first pilot.
