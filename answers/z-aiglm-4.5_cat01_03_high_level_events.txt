### High-Level Activity Grouping

Based on the analysis of the event log, I propose five distinct high-level process steps that group the low-level events into meaningful manufacturing stages. The grouping is based on **temporal proximity** (events occurring consecutively within a short timeframe), **logical cohesion** (events contributing to a shared objective), **resource similarity** (events performed by the same resource or resource type), and **process-phase alignment** (events marking distinct stages like preparation, assembly, or inspection). Below is the structured representation:

---

#### **1. Material Preparation**  
**Low-Level Activities Included:**  
- Retrieve raw metal sheet  
- Scan barcode  
- Place metal sheet on table  
- Align metal sheet  
- Preheat metal sheet  

**Rationale for Grouping:**  
These events collectively prepare the raw material for subsequent manufacturing steps. They occur in a tight temporal sequence (all within 15 seconds for Case A1/B2) and involve resources focused on material handling (Operator A, Robot Arm #2, and Heating Unit #1). The activities represent a coherent "setup" phase: retrieval and identification (`Retrieve`, `Scan`), physical positioning (`Place`, `Align`), and thermal conditioning (`Preheat`) to ready the material for welding. This group is logically distinct from later steps as it involves no irreversible transformations (e.g., welding or coating).  

---

#### **2. Welding Assembly**  
**Low-Level Activities Included:**  
- Pick up welding tool  
- Weld corner A  
- Weld corner B  

**Rationale for Grouping:**  
These events constitute the core assembly phase where the metal sheet is permanently joined. They are performed consecutively by the same resource (Operator B) within 5–10 seconds, indicating a focused workflow. The activities are interdependent: tool preparation (`Pick up welding tool`) directly enables the joining actions (`Weld corner A/B`). This group represents a transformative process step, distinct from preparatory or finishing stages, and is temporally isolated (no overlapping events from other groups).  

---

#### **3. Weld Quality Inspection**  
**Low-Level Activities Included:**  
- Measure weld integrity  

**Rationale for Grouping:**  
This is a targeted quality control step immediately following welding. It occurs within 10 seconds of the last weld and uses a dedicated quality resource (Quality Sensor #1). Though a single event, it is a critical phase boundary: it validates the output of the Welding Assembly step before proceeding to coating. Its isolation as a high-level step emphasizes its role as a gatekeeper for process quality, distinct from broader inspection steps (e.g., the final visual check).  

---

#### **4. Coating Application**  
**Low-Level Activities Included:**  
- Apply protective coating  
- Dry coating  

**Rationale for Grouping:**  
These events form a unified finishing sub-process. They occur consecutively (within 15 seconds) and involve resources dedicated to surface treatment (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2). The activities are chemically and physically interdependent: coating application (`Apply`) necessitates immediate curing (`Dry`) to achieve material properties. This group is temporally separated from other steps (e.g., welding or final inspection) and represents a distinct phase focused on surface protection.  

---

#### **5. Final Quality Check**  
**Low-Level Activities Included:**  
- Visual check  

**Rationale for Grouping:**  
This event serves as the end-of-line quality assurance step. It occurs after all manufacturing activities (coating and drying) and involves a human operator (Operator C) performing a holistic inspection. Though a single event, it is a distinct process boundary: it validates the entire product (including welds, coating, and alignment) before completion. Its temporal isolation (last event in the sequence) and manual resource justify its separation from automated inspections (e.g., Weld Quality Inspection).

### **Key Insights for Scalability**  
- **Temporal Thresholds**: Events within 15–20 seconds of each other (e.g., Material Preparation events) are strong candidates for grouping, as they reflect uninterrupted workflows.  
- **Resource Patterns**: Activities performed by the same resource (e.g., Operator B in Welding Assembly) or resource type (e.g., heating units in Material Preparation and Coating Application) indicate cohesive steps.  
- **Phase Boundaries**: Quality checks (e.g., `Measure weld integrity`, `Visual check`) naturally demarcate transitions between major process stages.  
- **Generalization**: This grouping logic can be scaled to the full log using automated rules (e.g., clustering events by time/resource similarity and naming groups based on dominant activities).
