# Contextual Activity Renaming Analysis

## 1. Identifying Recurring Activities and Contextual Shifts

Three activity labels recur within the same case (the core criterion), and one varies meaningfully across cases:

| Original Activity | Recurs Within Case? | Cases Affected |
|---|---|---|
| **Verify Documents** |  Yes (twice in C001, twice in C003) | C001, C002, C003 |
| **Call Customer** |  Yes (twice in C002) | C001, C002, C003 |
| **Initiate Request** | No (once per case, but channel differs) | C001, C002, C003 |
| Adjust Account | No | C002, C003 |
| Approve Request | No | C001, C002, C003 |

## 2. Contextual Interpretation of Each Recurrence

### **Verify Documents**

| Occurrence | Contextual Role | Clues |
|---|---|---|
| **1st in a case** | An *initial screening* of the customer's identity documents — the process's first gate. | Always follows immediately after initiation; context says "checks," "verification," "physical verification." |
| **2nd in a case** (C001 & C003) | A *re-verification* triggered by an intervening corrective action (new document submitted or account adjusted). The agent is **not** performing routine screening — they are confirming that a gap has been closed. | Appears *after* "Submit Additional" (C001) or "Adjust Account" (C003); context explicitly uses "re-checks" / "re-verify." |

### **Call Customer**

| Occurrence | Contextual Role | Clues |
|---|---|---|
| **C001 – only call** | *Outbound call to request missing documentation.* It's a remediation action triggered by an incomplete verification. | Context: "request missing docs"; follows a failed first verification; resource is FrontlineAgent. |
| **C002 – 1st call** | *Outbound call to clarify a discrepancy.* This is an investigative call, not about missing docs but about conflicting account information. | Context: "clarify account discrepancy"; triggers an account adjustment afterward. |
| **C002 – 2nd call** | *Follow-up confirmation call.* The issue has been resolved internally and the agent is now closing the loop with the customer. | Context: "confirm adjustments made"; occurs *after* the Adjust Account step. |
| **C003 – only call** | *Recall customer to branch.* Entirely different purpose — logistical, not informational. The customer physically left and needs to return. | Context: "calls to have them return"; resource is the same BranchOfficer (in-person context). |

### **Initiate Request** (cross-case variation)

Though it doesn't repeat *within* a case, the channel and resource differ significantly (WebPortal vs. BranchReception), which affects downstream behavior (digital vs. physical verification). Renaming adds analytical value.

## 4. Justification Summary

| Original Name | Renamed Variants | Key Contextual Clues Used |
|---|---|---|
| **Verify Documents** | *Initial Identity Check* vs. *Re-verification After Submission/Adjustment* | **Position in the trace**: first occurrence is always the gate-check; second occurrence always follows a corrective step. **Language cues**: "checks" vs. "re-checks"/"re-verify." **Trigger**: the re-verification is *caused by* an intervening event (new upload or account fix). |
| **Call Customer** | *Request Missing Documents* / *Clarify Account Discrepancy* / *Confirm Adjustments* / *Recall to Branch* | **Purpose of the call** differs each time: soliciting documents  investigating data  confirming resolution  logistics. **Sequence position**: pre-adjustment calls are investigative; post-adjustment calls are confirmatory. **Additional Context field** explicitly states the intent. |
| **Initiate Request** | *Online Portal* vs. *Branch Walk-In* | **Resource/channel**: `WebPortal` vs. `BranchReception`. This drives the entire downstream variant (digital back-office verification vs. physical branch-officer verification). |
| **Adjust Account** | *Post-Clarification Correction* vs. *Internal Data Correction* | **Trigger**: C002's adjustment follows a customer clarification call; C003's is an internal discovery of missing info with no preceding customer input. |
| **Approve Request** / **Submit Additional** | *(Unchanged)* | These are unambiguous: they occur once per case with consistent meaning and context. No renaming needed. |
