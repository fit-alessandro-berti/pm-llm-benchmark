### Rationale for the added bias-mitigating constraints
- **`response(CheckApplicantRace/Gender/Age  BiasMitigationCheck)`**: ensures that whenever sensitive attributes are accessed/used, the process must perform a dedicated fairness/bias control step afterwards, reducing the risk of unreviewed biased decisions.
- **`precedence(BiasMitigationCheck  FinalDecision)` and `succession(BiasMitigationCheck  FinalDecision)`**: guarantees no case reaches a final decision without a prior mitigation check; also ensures that if the check is performed it is not “dead-ended” and a decision is eventually made.
- **`nonchainsuccession(CheckApplicant*  Reject/Approve/FinalDecision)`**: blocks *immediate* decisions right after reading sensitive attributes (a common pattern of discriminatory shortcuts), forcing at least one intervening step (e.g., BiasMitigationCheck, ManualReview, additional assessments).
- **`responded_existence/coexistence(Approve_Sensitive or Reject_Sensitive  ManualReview)` plus `precedence(ManualReview  Approve_Sensitive/Reject_Sensitive)`**: enforces consistent extra scrutiny for sensitive-group decisions and ensures the review happens *before* the sensitive decision, limiting disparate treatment by requiring the same control activity whenever those sensitive decisions occur.
- **`response/ responded_existence(SensitiveApplicantFlag  ManualReview, BiasMitigationCheck)` and `nonchainsuccession(SensitiveApplicantFlag  decision)`**: if a case is flagged as involving protected characteristics, it must trigger both additional governance (manual review) and a bias check, and it cannot go straight to an outcome immediately after the flag.
