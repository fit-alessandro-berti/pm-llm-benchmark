Trace the model accepts but should be forbidden:
- Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Ship_Order, Package_Items, Authorize_Payment, Close_Order

Why the model allows it:
- The “successful” branch is a PARALLEL node over Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, and Ship_Order, so it permits any ordering of these three activities.

Why this is wrong in the domain:
- Shipping before packaging is physically impossible and violates the natural fulfillment order (items must be packaged before they can be shipped).
- Shipping before payment authorization violates financial controls; payment should be authorized before fulfillment.

Note: Another underfitting symptom is that the cancel path yields two closures:
- Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Cancel_Order, Close_Order, Close_Order
This occurs because Close_Order appears both inside the cancel branch and again at the root—closing the order twice should not be allowed.
