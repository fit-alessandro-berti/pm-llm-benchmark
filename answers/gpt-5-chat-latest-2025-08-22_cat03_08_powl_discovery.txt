Perfect — let’s carefully transform the **complex event log** into a **POWL model**.  

We need to abstract the observed behavior into a **partially ordered workflow with loops, choices, concurrency, and silent transitions where needed**.  

---

##  Step 1. Analyze Process Behaviors from Event Log

From the traces, we observe:

1. **Always Start:**  
   - OR  MS  QS  AS

2. **Assembly + Inline Quality Check (IQC)**:  
   - After AS, we may perform IQC, and if failed, return back to AS.  
   - This suggests a **loop structure:**  
     - Body = {AS}  
     - Redo branch = {IQC  AS}  
   - Some cases skip IQC entirely (case 4). 

3. **Main Testing & Retesting**:  
   - After assembly is complete, we go into TST.  
   - If TST fails, we have RT, then loop back to TST.  
   - This is another **loop structure:**  
     - Body = {TST}  
     - Redo branch = {RT  TST}.  
   - Sometimes RT does not occur (case 2, 4). 

4. **Packaging, Labeling, Dispatch Prep**:  
   - After successful testing: PK always occurs.  
   - Labeling (LB) may or may not occur (case 2 skips it).   a **choice** structure.  
   - Then DP  D always occur.

5. **Concurrency Check**:  
   - No clear concurrency.  
   - Everything is sequential except optional skips (choices).  
   - So the **partial order** is mostly sequential.

##  Step 2. Map Activities to POWL Elements

- **Activities = Transition("...")**
- **Choices = XOR**
- **Loops = LOOP**
- **Skip steps = SilentTransition()**

---

##  Step 3. Build POWL Components

### (A) Assembly + IQC Loop
``` 
* ( AS , IQC  AS )
```
- First execute **AS**, then either exit or go into **IQC + AS** loop.  

POWL form:
```python
loop_assembly = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[AS, StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[IQC, AS2])]
)
# AS2 is a fresh duplicate node for reuse
```

---

### (B) Testing + Retesting Loop
``` 
* ( TST , RT  TST )
```

---

### (C) Packaging / Labeling Choice
```
X ( LB ,  )
```
- Meaning either **do LB** or **skip** using a silent transition.

---

### (D) Wrap Packaging + Labeling
```
PO = { PK , X(LB, ) , DP , D }
with order: PK  X(LB,)  DP  D
```

---

##  Step 4. Put It All Together

Now full **process sequence** is:

```
OR  MS  QS  (Assembly + IQC Loop)  (Testing + Retesting Loop)
    PK  [Choice: LB or Skip]  DP  D
```

---

##  Final POWL Structure

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# --- Basic activities ---
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
AS2 = Transition(label="AS")    # For loop branch
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")

TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")

PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")

 = SilentTransition()

# --- Assembly + IQC Loop: * (AS , IQC  AS) ---
loop_assembly_branch = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[IQC, AS2])
loop_assembly_branch.order.add_edge(IQC, AS2)

loop_assembly = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, loop_assembly_branch])

# --- Testing + Retest Loop: * (TST , RT  TST) ---
loop_testing_branch = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RT, TST])
loop_testing_branch.order.add_edge(RT, TST)

loop_testing = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, loop_testing_branch])

# --- Labeling Choice: X (LB , ) ---
labeling_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, ])

# --- Final packaging and dispatch order ---
pack_dispatch = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[PK, labeling_choice, DP, D])
pack_dispatch.order.add_edge(PK, labeling_choice)
pack_dispatch.order.add_edge(labeling_choice, DP)
pack_dispatch.order.add_edge(DP, D)

# --- Overall Process Order ---
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, loop_assembly, loop_testing, pack_dispatch])

root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, loop_assembly)
root.order.add_edge(loop_assembly, loop_testing)
root.order.add_edge(loop_testing, pack_dispatch)

```

##  Explanation of Model

- **Order Received (OR)**  **Material Sourcing (MS)**  **Quality Screening (QS)**.  
- Then, **Assembly** cycle with **IQC** possible multiple times.  
- Once assembly is finished, go into **Testing (TST)** which may loop back via **Re-Testing (RT)** until passed.  
- After testing: **Packaging (PK)**.  
- Labeling may be performed **or skipped**.  
- Then final logistics: **Distribution Planning (DP)**  **Dispatch (D)**.

 This **POWL model** captures **all five observed cases** in the log, including loops, skips, and alternate paths.

Would you like me to also **draw a visual graph** of this POWL model (like a structured workflow diagram), so it’s easier to understand than just code?
