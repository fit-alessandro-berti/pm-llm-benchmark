We are going to create two POWL models for the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions.

First, we define the common activities (with labels) that we will use in both models:

- ReceiveApplication
- DataCompletenessCheck (this might be part of a loop with RequestMoreInfo)
- RequestMoreInfo (for the loop when data is missing)
- SkillAssessment
- CulturalFitCheck (standard cultural fit evaluation)
- CommunityAffiliationCheck (this is the biased branch, only in the first model)
- ManagerialReview
- FinalDecision

We note that the process description includes a loop for data completeness. This loop can be modeled as a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. The loop exits when the data is complete.

Now, for the two models:

1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:
   After the skill assessment, there is an XOR branch. One branch is the standard CulturalFitCheck, and the other is the CommunityAffiliationCheck (which gives an advantage). Then, both branches converge to the ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

   Steps:
   - ReceiveApplication
   - Then, a loop for data completeness: we do DataCompletenessCheck, and if data is missing, we RequestMoreInfo and then do DataCompletenessCheck again. When data is complete, we exit the loop and proceed.
   - Then, SkillAssessment.
   - Then, an XOR branch: either
        a. CulturalFitCheck (for those without the affiliation) OR
        b. CommunityAffiliationCheck (for those with the affiliation, which gives an advantage)
   - Then, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision in sequence.

   We note that the loop for data completeness is a loop between two activities: DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. The loop structure is * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo). This means we start with DataCompletenessCheck, then if we need to request more info, we do RequestMoreInfo and then DataCompletenessCheck again, until we don't need to request more info.

   The process after the loop is a sequence of: SkillAssessment, then the XOR branch, then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

   However, note that the XOR branch leads to two different activities, but both must complete before ManagerialReview. So we can model the XOR as having two branches, and then we have a partial order that says both the XOR and the subsequent steps are in sequence.

   Actually, the XOR is a choice between two activities, and after that choice, we have ManagerialReview and FinalDecision. So the structure is:

   ReceiveApplication -> Loop -> SkillAssessment -> (XOR: CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

   We can model the entire process as a partial order with the following nodes and edges.

   But note: the loop is a single node (the loop operator) and the XOR is a single node (the XOR operator). We break down the process into:

   Let:
   - A = ReceiveApplication
   - Loop = * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
   - B = SkillAssessment
   - XOR = X (CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)
   - C = ManagerialReview
   - D = FinalDecision

   Then the partial order would have nodes [A, Loop, B, XOR, C, D] and edges:
   A -> Loop
   Loop -> B
   B -> XOR
   XOR -> C
   C -> D

   However, note that the loop itself is a complex node. We have to define the loop and the XOR with their children.

2. POWL Model Without Unfairness:
   In this model, we remove the CommunityAffiliationCheck and the XOR branch. Instead, all applicants undergo the same CulturalFitCheck.

   So the process becomes:
   ReceiveApplication -> Loop -> SkillAssessment -> CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

   We can model this as a sequence of nodes.

   Let:
   - A = ReceiveApplication
   - Loop = * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
   - B = SkillAssessment
   - C = CulturalFitCheck
   - D = ManagerialReview
   - E = FinalDecision

   Then the partial order would have nodes [A, Loop, B, C, D, E] and edges:
   A -> Loop
   Loop -> B
   B -> C
   C -> D
   D -> E

   Now, we write the code for both models.

   We assume that the loop for data completeness is the same in both models.

   We'll create the loop node for data completeness as:
   loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

   For the first model (with unfairness), we create an XOR node for the cultural fit vs community check.

   For the second model, we just have the CulturalFitCheck activity.

   Let's code accordingly.

**POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# XOR branch for cultural evaluation
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Main partial order
nodes = [ReceiveApplication, data_loop, SkillAssessment, cultural_xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)
order.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)
order.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)
order.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_xor)
order.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, ManagerialReview)
order.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

unfair_model = order
```

**POWL Model Without Unfairness:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Main partial order (sequential flow)
nodes = [ReceiveApplication, data_loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)
order.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)
order.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)
order.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
order.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
order.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

fair_model = order
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Unfair Model:** Contains an XOR gateway (`cultural_xor`) that allows different evaluation paths based on community affiliations, introducing potential bias through `CommunityAffiliationCheck`.  
- **Fair Model:** Uses a single sequential path where all applicants undergo the same `CulturalFitCheck`, eliminating the biased XOR branch while retaining the data completeness loop.
