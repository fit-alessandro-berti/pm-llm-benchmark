Okay, so I have this problem about loan application processes, and I need to figure out which cases are violating the normative rules and which ones are just failing the desiderata. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the normative constraints. The process must follow a strict sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case. There are specific ordering rules that can't be skipped or reversed. Also, certain activities are only allowed under specific conditions, like finalizing documentation only if the loan is approved.

Now, let's look at each case one by one.

**Case 1:**
- Activities in order: Application, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case.
- Timestamps are sequential, and each activity follows the correct order. No issues here. It seems to comply fully with the normative rules.

**Case 2:**
- The sequence is: Application, Risk Assessment (without Credit Check first), then Credit Check, Loan Decision (Rejected), Finalize Documentation, Close Case.
- The problem here is that Risk Assessment happened before Credit Check, which violates the normative rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. Also, after the loan was rejected, they still finalized documentation, which is not allowed. So, Case 2 definitely has normative violations.

**Case 3:**
- The process starts with Application, then Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case.
- The normative sequence is followed correctly. However, the Credit Check happened two days later, which is more than 24 hours after the application, violating the desideratum. Also, Inform Applicant was done two days after the Loan Decision, exceeding the recommended 48 hours. Additionally, there's no Follow-up Call, which is another desideratum. So, Case 3 doesn't violate the strict rules but fails some best practices.

So, to answer the questions:

1. Which cases violate normative rules?
   - Case 2 violates because it did Risk Assessment before Credit Check and finalized documentation after rejection.

2. Which cases fail desiderata?
   - Case 3 fails because Credit Check was late, Inform Applicant was delayed, and no Follow-up Call.

3. Justifications:
   - For Case 2, maybe there was an urgent need or a system error that caused the order to be mixed up. The documentation finalization after rejection might have been a mistake.
   - For Case 3, delays could be due to processing backlogs or resource issues. The lack of a Follow-up Call might be an oversight or considered unnecessary in this case.

I think that covers all the points. I need to make sure I'm not missing any other violations. Let me double-check each case against the normative constraints again.

Case 1: All activities in correct order and no extra steps. Good.

Case 2: Wrong order and unauthorized documentation. Definitely a violation.

Case 3: Correct order but missed the timing and follow-up. Just desiderata issues.

I think that's it. Now, I can structure the answer accordingly.

**Answer:**

**1. Normative Rule Violations:**

- **Case 2:**
  - **Violation 1:** The Risk Assessment was conducted before the Credit Check, violating the rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.
  - **Violation 2:** Documentation was finalized after the loan was rejected, which is not permitted.

**2. Desiderata Failures:**

- **Case 3:**
  - **Failure 1:** The Credit Check was completed more than 24 hours after the application was received, exceeding the recommended timeframe.
  - **Failure 2:** The applicant was informed about the decision 48 hours after the loan was approved, which is outside the suggested prompt notification period.
  - **Failure 3:** A Follow-up Call, although recommended, was not conducted before closing the case.

**3. Justifications and Interpretations:**

- **Case 2:**
  - The sequence error might have resulted from an urgent situation or a system glitch that led to the activities being out of order. The documentation step after rejection could have been an oversight or procedural error, possibly due to staff inattention or a breakdown in communication.

- **Case 3:**
  - The delays in Credit Check and notification could be attributed to a backlog in processing or limited resources, which are external factors beyond immediate control. The omission of the Follow-up Call might have been a deliberate decision if all parties were already aligned, or it could be an oversight in the process.

In summary, Case 2 violates strict process rules, while Case 3, though following the correct sequence, fails to meet the recommended best practices.
