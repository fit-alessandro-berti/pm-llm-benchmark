# Rationale:
# - Coexistence constraints ensure that any decision involving sensitive attributes (like `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`) must always go through a `ManualReview`.
# - Response constraint ensures that after checking an applicant's sensitive attribute (`CheckApplicantRace`), a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity must follow, providing an opportunity for fairness assessment before making a decision.
# - Succession constraint ensures that `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede any `FinalDecision`, adding a layer of review before decisions are made, particularly following sensitive attribute checks.
```

The updated `declare_model` dictionary includes new constraints that ensure fairness in the loan application process by introducing checks and balances specifically tailored to prevent bias against applicants based on sensitive attributes. These constraints enforce that sensitive decision points are never bypassed without thorough review, promoting a more equitable and transparent decision-making process.
