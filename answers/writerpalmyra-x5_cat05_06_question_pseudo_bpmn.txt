1. What criteria are used to determine which components are sourced from specific countries, and how might geopolitical tensions influence these decisions?

2. How does the organization ensure alignment between market research insights and the technical capabilities pursued during R&D?

3. What contingency plans exist if one of the critical component supply lines (e.g., microprocessors from Taiwan) is disrupted due to political, logistical, or natural events?

4. Why was Malaysia chosen as the central assembly hub, and how do labor costs, infrastructure, and trade policies factor into this decision?

5. How is quality defined and measured during the diagnostics phase, and what thresholds determine whether a unit undergoes rework versus being scrapped?

6. In what ways could the parallel sourcing of components create inefficiencies or coordination challenges, and how are these managed?

7. What role does real-time data play in synchronizing component arrivals at the assembly plant, and how is lead time variability mitigated?

8. How does the company balance the cost-benefit trade-off between air freight for speed and maritime shipping for economy?

9. What regulatory hurdles are most frequently encountered during customs clearance across different regions, and how is compliance standardized?

10. How are regional differences in consumer preferences reflected in packaging, labeling, or final configuration decisions?

11. What communication protocols exist between R&D, procurement, logistics, and sales teams to ensure end-to-end visibility and responsiveness?

12. How does the business handle demand spikes that exceed forecast accuracy, especially when component lead times are long?

13. What ethical or sustainability considerations are integrated into supplier selection and logistics planning?

14. How might nearshoring or regionalization of production impact the current global setup, particularly in response to supply chain volatility?

15. What performance indicators are most critical at each stage—especially between assembly, quality control, and distribution—and how are they monitored?

16. How does the feedback loop from sales forecasting influence not just supplier orders, but also future product design and innovation?

17. In what ways could digital twins or simulation modeling improve the resilience and agility of this supply chain?

18. How are risks distributed among suppliers, logistics partners, and internal divisions, and where are the single points of failure?

19. What role does cross-functional collaboration play during the transition from one sales cycle to the next, especially when demand shifts unexpectedly?

20. How is customer experience—from delivery timing to product readiness—tracked post-distribution, and how does that inform upstream process adjustments?
