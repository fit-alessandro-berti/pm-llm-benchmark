Below is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics. The dictionary includes a representative subset of activity pairs, considering both directly connected activities and those separated by multiple steps. The estimated average times and standard deviations are based on the logical sequence of activities, the complexity of each step, and the potential variability in delays due to factors such as supplier reliability, inspection thoroughness, and distribution logistics. Times are expressed in seconds, with reasonable estimates reflecting the nature of each activity pair.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (43200, 7200),      # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: ~12 hours avg, ~2 hours std (quick transition with some variability)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (259200, 43200),    # Supplier Selection to Receive Components: ~3 days avg, ~12 hours std (longer delay with moderate variability)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (302400, 43200),    # Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection: ~3.5 days avg, ~12 hours std (after receiving components)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (604800, 86400),    # Supplier Selection to Distribution: ~7 days avg, ~1 day std (entire process duration, high variability)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (216000, 43200),    # Order Placement to Receive Components: ~2.5 days avg, ~12 hours std (supplier lead time)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (345600, 43200),    # Order Placement to Component Assembly: ~4 days avg, ~12 hours std (after receiving and inspecting)
    ('OP', 'AS'): (777600, 86400),    # Order Placement to After-Sales Support: ~9 days avg, ~1 day std (post-distribution support, high variability)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 7200),      # Receive Components to Quality Inspection: ~12 hours avg, ~2 hours std (quick follow-up with low variability)
    ('RC', 'PT'): (172800, 21600),    # Receive Components to Product Testing: ~2 days avg, ~6 hours std (after inspection and assembly)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 14400),     # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: ~1 day avg, ~4 hours std (moderate delay with some variability)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 14400),     # Component Assembly to Product Testing: ~1 day avg, ~4 hours std (testing follows assembly)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 7200),      # Product Testing to Packaging: ~12 hours avg, ~2 hours std (quick transition after testing)
    ('PT', 'DT'): (129600, 21600),    # Product Testing to Distribution: ~1.5 days avg, ~6 hours std (after packaging and storage)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (21600, 3600),      # Packaging to Warehouse Storage: ~6 hours avg, ~1 hour std (quick storage after packaging)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 14400),     # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: ~1 day avg, ~4 hours std (shipping delay with variability)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (172800, 43200)     # Distribution to After-Sales Support: ~2 days avg, ~12 hours std (support after delivery, moderate variability)
}
```

### Explanation of Choices:
- **Directly Connected Pairs (e.g., 'SS' to 'OP', 'RC' to 'QI')**: These have shorter average times and lower standard deviations, reflecting more predictable and quicker transitions between sequential steps.
- **Distant Pairs (e.g., 'SS' to 'DT', 'OP' to 'AS')**: These have longer average times and higher standard deviations, accounting for the cumulative delays and variability across multiple intermediate steps.
- **Variability (Standard Deviation)**: Higher variability is assigned to pairs involving external factors (e.g., supplier lead times for 'OP' to 'RC', distribution delays for 'WS' to 'DT') or complex processes (e.g., after-sales support for 'DT' to 'AS').
- **Subset Selection**: Not all possible pairs are included to keep the dictionary manageable, but it covers a mix of adjacent and non-adjacent activities to represent the complexity of the supply chain process.

This temporal profile can be used to detect deviations in process executions by comparing observed times against the defined thresholds using the provided `ZETA` parameter.
