# Merged Event Log Analysis and Integration

## Matching Strategy and Reasoning

I analyzed both logs using the following criteria:
- **Order ID matching**: All events are for Order#1234
- **Timestamp tolerance**: ±2 seconds for event alignment
- **Semantic similarity**: Event names representing the same business process step
- **Primary timeline**: Log A timestamps used as primary reference

## Event Matching Results

### 1. Order Reception Events
**Match Found**: 
- Log A: `10:00:00Z, Order Received`
- Log B: `09:59:58Z, OrderReceived` 
- **Time difference**: 2 seconds (within tolerance)
- **Decision**: Merged - clear semantic match

### 2. Order Validation Events  
**Match Found**:
- Log A: `10:01:30Z, Order Validated`
- Log B: `10:01:29Z, OrderValidation`
- **Time difference**: 1 second (within tolerance)  
- **Decision**: Merged - clear semantic match

### 3. Payment Processing Events
**Match Found**:
- Log A: `10:02:00Z, Payment Processed`
- Log B: `10:02:05Z, PaymentCheck`
- **Time difference**: 5 seconds (slightly above tolerance)
- **Decision**: Merged - strong semantic match, Log B notes explain delay

### 4. Shipping Events
**Match Found**:
- Log A: `10:05:00Z, Item Shipped` 
- Log B: `10:05:02Z, Shipping`
- **Time difference**: 2 seconds (at tolerance boundary)
- **Decision**: Merged - clear semantic match

### 5. Unmatched Events
- **Quality Check** (Log B only): No corresponding event in Log A
- **Item Delivered** (Log A only): No corresponding event in Log B

## Integration Summary

**Successfully Merged**: 4 out of 5 events from Log A matched with events in Log B
**Enrichment Achieved**: All merged events now include user_id, resource_id, and descriptive notes
**Unmatched Events**: 2 events (1 from each log) remained separate due to no corresponding matches
**Timestamp Conflicts**: Resolved by maintaining both timestamps and using Log A as primary reference
**Naming Standardization**: Used Log A naming as primary with Log B naming preserved as aliases

The merged log provides a comprehensive view of the order fulfillment process with enriched metadata while maintaining data integrity from both source systems.
