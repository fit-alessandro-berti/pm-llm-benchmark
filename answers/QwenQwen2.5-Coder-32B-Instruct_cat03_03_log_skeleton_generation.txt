To construct the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process scenario, we will analyze the logical relationships among the activities and define the declarative constraints accordingly.

### Analysis:
- **Receive Order (RO)**: Must be the starting activity.
- **Check Availability (CA)**: Should follow immediately after Receive Order.
- **Reserve Items (RI)**: Should occur after CA.
- **Pick Items (PI)**: Should occur after RI.
- **Quality Check (QC)**: After PI, to inspect the picked items.
- **Pack Order (PO)**: Should follow QC.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**: After PO, before dispatch.
- **Dispatch (D)**: Should occur after GSL.
- **Invoice Customer (IC)**: Should be done once the order is dispatched (D).
- **Record Payment (RP)**: Usually happens when the customer has paid, but this activity might not be strictly related to the other activities in terms of a always before/after relationship unless it's a specific requirement.

### Log Skeleton Constraints:
- **Equivalence:** No activities in the order fulfillment process justify being directly equivalent based on the operational definition.
- **Always Before:** Ensures a logical sequence of activities.
- **Always After:** Ensures activities are executed only after their prerequisites are met.
- **Never Together:** No constraints as per provided scenario, since activities are sequential.
- **Activity Occurrences:** All activities can occur once per case, except where noted.
- **Directly-Follows Constraints:** Activities must follow in a specific sequence.

Based on the above analysis, the Log Skeleton can be constructed as follows:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    'always_before': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receive Order before Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Check Availability before Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserve Items before Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Pick Items before Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Quality Check before Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Pack Order before Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # Generate Shipping Label before Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),   # Dispatch before Invoice Customer
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),  # Check Availability after Receive Order
        ('RI', 'CA'),  # Reserve Items after Check Availability
        ('PI', 'RI'),  # Pick Items after Reserve Items
        ('QC', 'PI'),  # Quality Check after Pick Items
        ('PO', 'QC'),  # Pack Order after Quality Check
        ('GSL', 'PO'), # Generate Shipping Label after Pack Order
        ('D', 'GSL'),  # Dispatch after Generate Shipping Label
        ('IC', 'D'),   # Invoice Customer after Dispatch
    },
    'never_together': set(),  # No activities should never co-exist
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},  # Receive Order exactly once per case
        'CA': {1},  # Check Availability exactly once per case
        'RI': {1},  # Reserve Items exactly once per case
        'PI': {1},  # Pick Items exactly once per case
        'QC': {1},  # Quality Check exactly once per case
        'PO': {1},  # Pack Order exactly once per case
        'GSL': {1}, # Generate Shipping Label exactly once per case
        'D': {1},   # Dispatch exactly once per case
        'IC': {1},  # Invoice Customer exactly once per case
        'RP': {0,1},# Record Payment zero or once per case (depends on payment)
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receive Order directly followed by Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Check Availability directly followed by Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserve Items directly followed by Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Pick Items directly followed by Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Quality Check directly followed by Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Pack Order directly followed by Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # Generate Shipping Label directly followed by Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),   # Dispatch directly followed by Invoice Customer
    },
}
```

This Log Skeleton captures all necessary constraints for the given order fulfillment process scenario in a large-scale distribution center.
