### **Detailed Explanation of the Pseudo-BPMN Business Process**  

This BPMN-like workflow represents a structured approach to handling customer requests, determining whether they are standard or custom, validating their feasibility, and finalizing the request with approval and invoicing. The process includes multiple decision points (gateways), parallel processing, and possible rework loops. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the process flow:  

---

### **1. Start Event â†’ Initial Customer Request Handling**  
- **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**  
  - The process begins when a customer submits a request for a product or service.  
  - This request could be for a standard product/service or a customized one.  

---

### **2. Request Type Determination (XOR Gateway: "Check Request Type")**  
- This **exclusive decision (XOR Gateway)** determines whether the request follows the **standard path** or the **custom path**.  
- **Two possible branches:**  
  - **Standard Request â†’ Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**  
  - **Custom Request â†’ Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**  

---

### **3A. Standard Request Path**  
#### **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**  
- Ensures that the request adheres to predefined rules (e.g., customer eligibility, pricing, availability).  

#### **Parallel Processing (AND Gateway: "Run Parallel Checks")**  
- If the request is valid, the process **branches into two parallel checks:**  
  - **Task C1: "Credit Check"** â€“ Verifies if the customer has sufficient credit.  
  - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"** â€“ Ensures that the requested item is in stock.  

#### **Joining the Parallel Paths**  
- Once both credit and inventory checks are complete, the process moves forward.  
- **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"** â€“ Determines when the customer can receive the product/service.  

---

### **3B. Custom Request Path**  
#### **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**  
- Since the request involves customization, this step evaluates whether it is feasible based on factors like production capacity, material availability, and technical requirements.  

#### **XOR Gateway: "Is Customization Feasible?"**  
- If **feasible**, the process continues to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation."**  
- If **not feasible**, the request is rejected:  
  - **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"** â€“ The customer is informed that their request cannot be fulfilled.  
  - The process ends for rejected requests.  

---

### **4. Approval Decision (XOR Gateway: "Is Approval Needed?")**  
- After the standard or custom request processing is completed, the system checks whether **managerial approval is required** (e.g., high-value orders, special conditions).  
- **Two possible branches:**  
  - **Approval required â†’ Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**  
  - **No approval needed â†’ Directly proceed to Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**  

---

### **5. Manager Approval Process (If Needed)**  
#### **XOR Gateway: "Is Approval Granted?"**  
- If **approved**, proceed to **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice."**  
- If **not approved**, the request must be re-evaluated:  
  - **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"** â€“ The team reviews the reasons for rejection and determines corrective actions.  
  - The process then loops back:  
    - **For custom requests:** Return to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"** to adjust pricing or conditions.  
    - **For standard requests:** Return to **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"** to reassess logistics.  

---

### **6. Final Steps: Invoice Generation & Customer Confirmation**  
- **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"** â€“ The final pricing and order details are confirmed, and an invoice is generated.  
- **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"** â€“ The customer receives a confirmation of the order status.  
- **End Event** â€“ The process is completed.  

---

### **Key Takeaways & Process Logic Summary**  

1. **Two Main Paths:**  
   - **Standard Requests** follow predefined rules and require credit/inventory validation.  
   - **Custom Requests** undergo feasibility analysis and may require additional processing.  

2. **Decision Gateways:**  
   - **XOR (Exclusive) Gateways** determine one specific path to follow (e.g., request type, feasibility, approval).  
   - **AND (Parallel) Gateways** allow multiple tasks to run simultaneously (e.g., credit and inventory checks).  

3. **Approval & Rework Logic:**  
   - Managerial approval is required for certain cases.  
   - If rejected, requests may be **re-evaluated and revised** instead of outright cancellation.  

4. **Convergence & Loops:**  
   - Parallel tasks must be completed before moving forward.  
   - If issues arise (e.g., approval denied), the process loops back to refine the request.

This structured approach ensures **efficient processing**, **validations at key checkpoints**, and **flexibility for handling rejections or modifications.** ðŸš€
