What you’re looking at is essentially an “arcdiagram” of a threestep enforcement process over time.  Here’s how to read it:

• Three horizontal lanes (from top to bottom) represent three distinct event types in a single “case” workflow:  
  1. “Send Fine”  
  2. “Insert Fine Notification”  
  3. “Send for Credit Collection”

• The xaxis is calendar time, spanning from about January 2000 on the left through April 2013 on the right.

• Each grey vertical tick in a lane marks the timestamp when that particular action happened for one case.

• Curved connecting lines (or “arcs”) join successive events in the same case:  
  – A fine is sent (top lane), sometime later a notification is inserted (middle lane), and if unpaid it may eventually be sent to collections (bottom lane).  
  – Grey arcs show all such transitions.  
  – The arcs that turn red highlight those cases that actually escalated all the way into credit collection.  The stronger the red, the more prominently that path contributed to a final collections event.

What jumps out from the picture is that in the early 2000s there were lots of fines issued (dense toplane ticks), fewer notifications, and very few collection actions.  In the mid2000s the notification stage fills out more, and you begin to see many red arcs from notifications down to collections—i.e. a growing proportion of unpaid fines moving into debt collection.  By the end of the series, overall activity thins out, but you can still pick out the cases that progressed through all three steps.
