This is a threestage, timebased “slopegraph” or parallelaxes view of the life cycle of a fine in the system, from 2000 through 2013.  Here’s how to read it:

•  Horizontal axes (all on the same time scale along the bottom)  
   –  Leftmost timestamp  January 25, 2000  
   –  Middle  September 9, 2006  
   –  Rightmost  April 24, 2013  

•  Three “lanes” or eventaxes, stacked vertically:  
   1.  Send Fine  
   2.  Insert Fine Notification  
   3.  Send for Credit Collection  

•  Each individual case (each fine) is a polyline that connects the date it was “Sent,” the date the notification was “Inserted,” and (for those that go that far) the date it was “Sent for Credit Collection.”  

•  Color and opacity encode “outcome”:  
   –  Grey, semitransparent lines are fines that stop after notification and never go to credit collection.  
   –  Redtinted, semitransparent lines are those cases that do proceed all the way to credit collection.  The red segments highlight the full threeevent trajectory.  

•  What you can see at a glance:  
   –  “Send Fine” events occur almost continuously (a dense grey bar at the top).  
   –  Between “Send Fine” and “Insert Notification” there are relatively short and consistent lags for most cases (vertical or shallow grey slopes), but a subset (in red) eventually lead to credit collection.  
   –  The “Insert Notification”  “Send for Credit Collection” legs (all shown in red) fan out diagonally, revealing variability in how long it takes before a case is escalated.  Noticeable clusters of red slopes around 2002, 2005–06, 2009 and 2012 show periods of heavier creditcollection activity.  

In short, it’s a case-level eventflow diagram that uses time on the x-axis, eventtype lanes on the y-axis, and line color to separate those fines that end up in credit collection (red) from those that do not (grey).
