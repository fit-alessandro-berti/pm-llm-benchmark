Below is a consolidated event log that combines and integrates all the given data. Each row represents a single event in the process. Events are grouped by `order_id` (Case ID) and are listed in chronological order. The "Resource" column shows the actor responsible for the event, based on the provided resource tables. The "Other Attributes" column includes additional relevant data, such as associated item, delivery, invoice, or payment details.

**Assumptions/Notes**:  
- The `Case ID` is the `order_id`.  
- For each picked item, an "Items Picked" event is recorded.  
- For each delivery, both "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events are recorded.  
- For each invoice, an "Invoice Issued" event is recorded.  
- For each payment, a "Payment Received" event is recorded.  
- If a resource could not be directly determined (e.g., payments), "Payment System" is used as a placeholder.  
- The chronological order is based on timestamps from the data.  
- Other attributes are included as key-value pairs for clarity.
