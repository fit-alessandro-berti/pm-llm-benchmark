Okay, I need to create an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim process described. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The scenario has several steps with possible loops for re-submission and in-depth investigations. 

First, the places should represent the states between activities. Let me list all the activities and their transitions. The main steps are CR, DV, FC, CA, AP, P, N, CL. Then there are the optional steps RDS (after DV if documents are incomplete) and II (after FC if fraud is suspected). Also, the loops mean that RDS can go back to DV, and II can loop back to FC multiple times.

Hmm, so the places would be the states between transitions. Let me think of the flow:

Start with a new claim (so initial marking has a token in the start place). The first transition is Claim Registration (CR), so the start place leads to CR's place. Then after CR, the next is Document Verification (DV). But if DV finds issues, it goes to RDS, which then goes back to DV. Wait, RDS is a transition that would take the token from DV's place back to DV again? Or maybe there's a place between DV and RDS?

Wait, perhaps the places are the states after each activity. Let me outline the flow step by step.

Let me list the transitions and their connections:

1. Start  CR  DV  [RDS  DV (loop) or proceed to FC]
Wait, after DV, if documents are incomplete, they go to RDS, which then requires re-submitting, so after RDS, they go back to DV again. So the RDS transition would take from the DV place (after DV is done) back to DV? Or maybe there's a place after DV that leads to RDS or FC?

Alternatively, perhaps the places are:

- Start (S)
- After CR (CR_place)
- After DV (DV_place)
- After FC (FC_place)
- After CA (CA_place)
- After AP (AP_place)
- After P (P_place)
- After N (N_place)
- Closure (CL_place, which is the final state)

But then the loops need to be considered. For example, after DV, if there's a problem, the process goes to RDS, which then brings it back to DV. So maybe between DV and FC, there's a transition RDS that loops back to DV. Wait, perhaps the DV transition leads to a place where you can either go to FC or RDS. Let me think again.

Let me structure the transitions and places step by step.

Starting with the initial place S (start). The first transition is CR (Claim Registration). So:

S  CR  ... 

After CR, the next step is DV. So after CR, the token moves to a place that leads to DV. Let's call the place after CR as CR_done. Then DV is the next transition. So:

CR  DV.

After DV, there are two possibilities: either proceed to FC (if documents are okay) or go to RDS (if not). So after DV, the token is in a place (DV_done). From there, if they go to RDS, then RDS would take them back to DV again. Wait, but RDS is a transition that would take from DV_done to DV again? Or maybe RDS is a transition that takes from DV_done to some other place that loops back to DV?

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition is between DV_done and DV again. Let me think:

DV's transition leads to a place (DV_place). Then from DV_place, there are two transitions: one to FC (if okay) and another to RDS (if not). The RDS transition would then take the token back to DV_place again? Or maybe to the DV transition again? Hmm, perhaps the RDS transition would take from DV_place to the DV transition again. Wait, maybe the RDS transition's target is the DV place again. Let me sketch this:

DV transition leads to DV_place. From DV_place, you can either go to FC (if okay) via an arc, or to RDS (the Re-Document Submission transition). The RDS transition would then take the token back to DV_place again. So that creates a loop between DV_place and RDS  DV_place. Wait, but RDS would be a transition that when fired, moves the token from DV_place to DV again? Or perhaps the RDS transition's output is the DV place again. Hmm, maybe the RDS transition's target is the DV place again, so after RDS, you have to go through DV again. That way, the loop is possible.

Similarly for FC and II. After FC, if there's a need for II, then the II transition would loop back to FC again. So FC's transition leads to FC_place, then from there, either proceed to CA or go to II, which loops back to FC_place again.

So the places would be:

- Start (S)
- After CR (CR_place)
- After DV (DV_place)
- After FC (FC_place)
- After CA (CA_place)
- After AP (AP_place)
- After P (P_place)
- After N (N_place)
- Closure (CL_place)

Wait, but the closure is the final state. Let me see the flow again:

The steps after CR are DV  (RDS loops back to DV)  then FC  (II loops back to FC)  CA  AP (if needed)  P  N  CL.

Wait, the Approval (AP) step is only needed if the compensation exceeds a threshold. Hmm, but the problem statement says "the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." However, the problem doesn't specify how that condition is modeled in the Petri net. Since Petri nets are static, perhaps the AP step is always present, but maybe the token can go through AP only when needed. Alternatively, perhaps the AP is part of the path, but the condition is not modeled here. Since the problem says to model the steps as per the description, perhaps we can assume that AP is a required step, but maybe the threshold is handled externally. So the process must go through all steps in order, with possible loops in DV and FC.

So the transitions and their connections:

Start  CR  DV  (RDS loops back to DV)  FC  (II loops back to FC)  CA  AP  P  N  CL.

Wait, but after FC, the next is CA. But if FC requires II, then after FC, you can go to II, which loops back to FC. So the FC transition leads to FC_place. From there, you can either proceed to CA (if no II needed) or go to II (which takes you back to FC_place again). Wait, but how is the choice made? Since Petri nets are deterministic in transitions, perhaps the transitions for II and the path to CA are both from FC_place, so the token can choose either path. But in reality, the decision to go to II or not is based on some condition. Since the problem says "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional II is performed", perhaps the FC transition can lead to either FC_place (if no II needed) or to II. Wait, maybe the FC transition's output is to FC_place, and then from FC_place, there's a transition to CA and a transition to II. So the token in FC_place can choose to go to CA (proceeding) or to II (which loops back to FC_place again). That way, multiple II steps can be done as needed.

Similarly for DV: after DV, the token is in DV_place. From there, it can go to FC (proceeding) or to RDS (which takes it back to DV_place again). So RDS is a transition that goes from DV_place to DV_place? Wait, no. The RDS transition would take from DV_place to the DV transition again? Or perhaps the RDS transition's target is the DV_place again. Wait, perhaps the RDS transition's destination is the DV_place again. Wait, maybe the RDS transition is between DV_place and DV_place? That can't be. Let me think again.

Let me outline the transitions and places step by step.

Places:

- S (start)
- CR_done (after CR)
- DV_done (after DV)
- FC_done (after FC)
- CA_done (after CA)
- AP_done (after AP)
- P_done (after P)
- N_done (after N)
- CL (closure, final)

Transitions:

CR: S  CR_done

DV: CR_done  DV_done

RDS: DV_done  DV_done (Wait, that can't be. Because RDS is a transition that would take the token from DV_done and then go back to DV again. Hmm, perhaps the RDS transition's output is the DV transition's source? Or maybe the RDS transition's destination is the DV_done place again? That would create a loop. Wait, perhaps the RDS transition is from DV_done to DV_done? That's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the RDS transition takes the token from DV_done and sends it back to the DV transition's input place. Wait, perhaps the DV transition's input is CR_done. So after RDS, the token would go back to CR_done? No, that's not right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition is between DV_done and DV_done? That's not possible. Maybe the RDS transition's destination is the DV_done place again. Wait, perhaps the RDS transition is from DV_done to the same DV_done place? That would require an arc from DV_done to DV_done via RDS, but that's a loop. But transitions must have input and output places. Wait, transitions have input places (arcs from) and output places (arcs to). So the RDS transition would have input from DV_done, and output to DV_done? That would mean that when RDS fires, the token stays in DV_done. But that's not helpful. Hmm, perhaps I need to model the RDS as a transition that takes the token from DV_done and sends it back to the DV transition's input place (CR_done?), but that would take it back to CR_done, which is before DV. That's not right. 

Alternatively, maybe the RDS transition's output is the DV transition's input place. Wait, the DV transition's input is CR_done. So after RDS, the token would go back to CR_done, but that would require going through CR again, which isn't desired. Hmm, perhaps I need to model the RDS as a transition that takes the token from DV_done and sends it back to the DV_done place via some other place? Or maybe there's a separate place for the re-submission step.

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition is between DV_done and DV_done, but that's not possible. Maybe the RDS transition's output is the same DV_done place. Wait, perhaps the RDS transition is from DV_done to DV_done? But that would require an arc from DV_done to RDS's output, which is DV_done again. But transitions must have input and output places. So the RDS transition would have input place DV_done, and output place DV_done. But that would mean that when RDS fires, the token remains in DV_done. That's not helpful. Hmm, maybe I need to model this differently.

Wait, perhaps the RDS transition is part of a loop where after DV, the token is in DV_done. Then, if they need to re-submit, they go through RDS, which takes them back to the DV transition's input place (CR_done?), but that would require going back through CR again, which isn't right. Alternatively, maybe the RDS transition's output is the DV transition's input place (CR_done), but that would require the token to go back to CR_done, which would require re-doing CR, which isn't desired. 

Hmm, perhaps I need to have a separate place for the re-submission step. Let me think again. Let's model the process with possible loops:

After DV, the token is in DV_done. From there, there are two options:

1. Proceed to FC: so an arc from DV_done to FC's input (which is DV_done's transition's output? Wait, the FC transition's input is DV_done. So the FC transition is triggered when there's a token in DV_done. Wait, perhaps the FC transition's input is DV_done, so when the token is in DV_done, firing FC would take it to FC_done. But then, if they need to do RDS, perhaps there's another transition RDS that takes from DV_done and sends it back to DV_done? That can't be. Alternatively, maybe the RDS transition takes from DV_done and sends it back to the DV transition's input (CR_done?), but that would require going back through CR again, which is not correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition is part of a loop that allows the token to go back to DV's input. Wait, maybe the RDS transition's output is the same DV_done place. Wait, perhaps the RDS transition is from DV_done to DV_done. But that would require an arc from DV_done to RDS's output, which is DV_done again. But transitions must have input and output places. So the RDS transition would have input DV_done and output DV_done. But that would mean that when RDS fires, the token stays in DV_done. That's not helpful. 

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of the RDS as a transition that requires the token to go back to the DV step. So after RDS is executed, the process goes back to DV. So the RDS transition's output should be the DV transition's input place. The DV transition's input is CR_done. So RDS would take from DV_done and send to CR_done? But then the token would go back to CR_done, which would require re-doing CR, which isn't desired. 

Alternatively, perhaps the DV transition's input is the start place after CR. Wait, maybe the places need to be redefined. Let me try to structure the places and transitions again, more carefully.

Let me list all the transitions and their inputs and outputs:

Transitions:

1. CR (Claim Registration): input is Start (S), output is a place after CR (let's call it CR_done).

2. DV (Document Verification): input is CR_done, output is DV_done.

3. RDS (Re-Document Submission): input is DV_done, output is DV_done? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps RDS's output is the same as DV's input (CR_done)? But that would send it back to CR_done, which would require re-doing CR. Not good.

Alternatively, maybe RDS's output is DV_done again. But that would loop without moving forward. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition's output is the same as DV's input (CR_done), but that's not right. Maybe the RDS transition is between DV_done and DV_done, but that's not possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition is part of a loop where after RDS, the process goes back to DV. So the RDS transition's output is the input place of DV (CR_done). But then the token would go back to CR_done, which would require re-doing CR. That's not desired. 

Hmm, maybe I need to have a separate place for the re-submission step. Let's think of the RDS as a transition that takes the token from DV_done and sends it to a place that allows it to go back to DV. For example:

After DV_done, the token can either go to FC (via FC transition) or to RDS. The RDS transition would take the token from DV_done to a new place, say RDS_done, which then connects back to DV's input (CR_done)? No, that would again require CR again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition's output is the DV_done place again. Wait, but that would require an arc from RDS to DV_done. So the RDS transition's input is DV_done, and output is DV_done. But that would mean that when RDS fires, the token stays in DV_done. That's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the RDS transition's output is the same as the DV transition's input (CR_done), but then the token would have to go through CR again. That's not correct. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the RDS is a step that requires the DV to be redone. So after RDS, the process goes back to DV. So the RDS transition's output should be the input place of DV (CR_done), but then the token would have to go through CR again. But that's not desired because the claim is already registered. So maybe the RDS is part of the DV process. 

Alternatively, perhaps the DV transition can have a loop. Let me think of the DV transition as having an arc from its output place back to its input. Wait, but transitions are between places. Let me think of the DV transition as taking from CR_done to DV_done. Then, if there's a need for RDS, the RDS transition would take from DV_done and send back to CR_done? No, that's not right. 

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS is a transition that takes from DV_done and sends to the same DV_done place. But that would require an arc from DV_done to RDS's output (DV_done), but that would mean the token remains there. Not helpful. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for a standard way to model loops in Petri nets. For a loop between two places, you can have a transition that connects them. For example, between A and B, a transition T1 from A to B, and another transition T2 from B back to A. But in this case, the RDS loop is between DV and RDS. Wait, perhaps the RDS is a transition that takes from DV_done and sends back to DV_done? No. Alternatively, perhaps the RDS is a transition that takes from DV_done and sends to a place that allows the DV to be re-entered. 

Alternatively, perhaps the DV process can be in a loop where after DV, if there's an error, the RDS is done, which then requires another DV. So the RDS transition would take the token from DV_done and send it back to the DV transition's input (CR_done). But that would require going back through CR again, which is not desired. 

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the RDS is part of the DV step. So after DV, if there's an error, the RDS is done, and then DV is repeated. So the RDS transition's output is the same as the DV's input (CR_done), but that would require the token to go back to CR_done, which would require re-doing CR. That's not right. 

Alternatively, perhaps the DV transition can have a loop. Let me think of the DV transition as having an arc from its output place back to its input. Wait, but transitions are between places. Let me think of the DV transition as taking from CR_done to DV_done. Then, if there's a need for RDS, the RDS transition would take from DV_done and send back to CR_done? No. 

Alternatively, maybe the RDS is a transition that takes from DV_done and sends to a new place, say RDS_place, and then from RDS_place back to DV_done. But that would create a loop between RDS_place and DV_done. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition is between DV_done and DV_done. But that's not possible. 

Hmm, maybe I need to model the RDS as a transition that allows the token to stay in DV_done but requires some condition. But Petri nets don't have conditions; the arcs are static. So the loops must be possible via transitions. 

Wait, perhaps the RDS transition is from DV_done to DV_done. But that would require an arc from DV_done to RDS's output (DV_done). But transitions must have input and output places. So the RDS transition would have input DV_done and output DV_done. That way, when RDS fires, the token remains in DV_done. But that's not helpful because the process needs to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the RDS transition's output is the same as the DV transition's input (CR_done). But then the token would go back to CR_done, requiring CR again. Which is not desired. 

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think of the process flow again. The steps after DV can either proceed to FC (if documents are okay) or go to RDS (if not). After RDS, the process must redo DV. So the RDS step is part of the DV process. So the flow would be:

DV  (if error, RDS  DV again). 

So the RDS transition must take the token from DV's output place (DV_done) and send it back to the input of DV (CR_done). But that would require going back through CR again. Which is not correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the DV transition's input is a place that allows looping. Let me try to model this with more places. 

Let me try to model the DV and RDS steps with a loop:

- The DV transition takes from a place (DV_input) to DV_output. 

Wait, perhaps the DV process is in a loop where the token can be in a DV_input place, and after DV, it goes to DV_output, but if there's an error, it goes back to DV_input via RDS. 

Alternatively, here's an approach:

Create a place for the DV step that can loop. Let's say:

- After CR, the token is in CR_done. 

The DV transition takes from CR_done to DV_place. 

From DV_place, there are two transitions: 

1. FC: which takes the token to FC_place (proceeding to next step)
2. RDS: which takes the token back to CR_done? No, that would require re-doing CR. 

Hmm, that's not right. Alternatively, the RDS transition takes from DV_place back to DV_place. But that would require an arc from DV_place to RDS's output (DV_place again). So the RDS transition's input is DV_place, and output is DV_place. Then, when RDS fires, the token stays in DV_place. But then how do you proceed to FC? 

Alternatively, the FC transition is also from DV_place. So the token can choose between FC and RDS. If it chooses FC, it proceeds to FC_place. If it chooses RDS, it stays in DV_place (since RDS's output is DV_place). Wait, but then the token would be stuck in DV_place unless it takes FC. 

Wait, that could work. Let me outline:

- DV_place is the place after DV is done. 

From DV_place, the transitions available are FC and RDS. 

The FC transition takes the token from DV_place to FC_place. 

The RDS transition takes the token from DV_place to DV_place (so it stays there). 

Wait, but how does the RDS transition's output be DV_place? Because the RDS transition's output is DV_place. So when RDS fires, the token remains in DV_place. But then, the next time, the same transitions (FC and RDS) are available again. So the loop is possible. 

Yes, that could work. So the RDS transition's output is DV_place. So the RDS transition is from DV_place to DV_place. 

Similarly for the FC and II steps. 

Let me try to model this way. 

So the places would be:

Start (S)

CR_done (after CR)

DV_place (after DV)

FC_place (after FC)

CA_place (after CA)

AP_place (after AP)

P_place (after P)

N_place (after N)

CL (closure)

Now transitions:

CR: S  CR_done

DV: CR_done  DV_place

FC: DV_place  FC_place (but also, there's RDS which loops back to DV_place)

RDS: DV_place  DV_place (so when RDS fires, the token stays in DV_place, allowing another DV to be done again?)

Wait, but the RDS is a transition that represents the Re-Document Submission. So after RDS is executed, the process goes back to DV. But how? Because the RDS transition's output is DV_place, so the token remains in DV_place. Then, the next step would again have the option to do FC or RDS again. So the loop is possible. 

Wait, but the DV transition is only from CR_done to DV_place. Once in DV_place, the only transitions are FC and RDS. So after RDS, the token stays in DV_place, so the next time, the same options are available. That allows multiple RDS steps. 

Similarly for FC and II:

FC is a transition from DV_place to FC_place. 

Then, after FC, the token is in FC_place. From there, there are two transitions: CA (proceed) or II (loop back to FC_place). 

II would be a transition from FC_place to FC_place. 

So:

II: FC_place  FC_place (so when II fires, the token stays in FC_place, allowing another FC check?)

Wait, but the FC step is supposed to be followed by either proceeding to CA or doing II again. So the II transition would take from FC_place back to FC_place. 

Then, when the token is in FC_place, it can choose to go to CA (via CA transition) or to II (staying in FC_place). 

This way, the II can be done multiple times. 

Proceeding further:

CA transition takes from FC_place to CA_place. 

Then AP (Approval) is next. But AP is only needed if the amount exceeds a threshold. Since the problem doesn't specify how to model the condition, perhaps AP is always part of the path. So after CA_place, the token goes to AP_place via AP transition. 

Then AP_place leads to P_place (Payment). 

P_place leads to N_place (Notification), which then leads to CL (closure). 

Wait, but the steps after CA are AP, then P, then N, then CL. 

So transitions after CA_place:

AP: CA_place  AP_place

Then P: AP_place  P_place

N: P_place  N_place

CL: N_place  CL (but CL is the final marking, so perhaps the transition to CL is not needed. The final marking has a token in CL. So the last transition would be from N_place to CL. 

Wait, but in Petri nets, the final marking is the state after all transitions have been fired as needed. So the transitions must form a path that ends at CL. 

Putting this all together:

Places:

- S (start)
- CR_done
- DV_place
- FC_place
- CA_place
- AP_place
- P_place
- N_place
- CL (final)

Transitions:

CR: S  CR_done

DV: CR_done  DV_place

FC: DV_place  FC_place

RDS: DV_place  DV_place (loop)

II: FC_place  FC_place (loop)

CA: FC_place  CA_place

AP: CA_place  AP_place

P: AP_place  P_place

N: P_place  N_place

CL_transition: N_place  CL (but maybe CL is a place, so the transition to CL is not needed. The final marking is when the token is in CL. So the last transition would be from N_place to CL. So a transition named 'Close' that takes from N_place to CL. 

Wait, but the problem says the final marking should represent the closed claim. So the final marking has a token in CL. So the path must end there. So the transitions must allow the token to reach CL. 

So adding a transition 'Close' from N_place to CL. 

Now, the transitions are:

Close: N_place  CL

Now, the initial marking (im) has a token in S. 

The final marking (fm) has a token in CL. 

But we need to make sure that all the transitions are properly connected. 

Now, let's check the loops:

For DV and RDS:

The token starts at S  CR  CR_done  DV  DV_place. 

At DV_place, the token can choose to fire FC (moving to FC_place) or RDS (staying in DV_place). 

If RDS is fired, the token stays in DV_place, so next time, again the same options. 

Once FC is fired, the token moves to FC_place. 

At FC_place, the token can choose to fire CA (moving to CA_place) or II (staying in FC_place). 

If II is fired, it stays in FC_place, allowing another FC check (but wait, FC is already done once. Hmm, perhaps the II is an additional check. So maybe the FC transition is only done once, and II is an additional step. Wait, the problem says "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)." 

Ah, so after FC, if there's a doubt, they do II, which may require another FC? Or does II just add to the FC step? 

The problem says: "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to CA." 

So after FC, if there's a doubt, they do II. But after II, do they need to redo FC again? The wording says "additional II is performed" multiple times. So perhaps after FC, if needed, they do II once, but can do it multiple times. So the loop is between FC and II. 

Wait, the problem says: "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)." 

So after FC, if there's a doubt, they do II. Then, perhaps after II, they might need to do another FC again? Or does the II count as part of the FC step? 

The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read:

"if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)."

Ah, so after FC, if there's a doubt, they do II. But after II, perhaps they have to do FC again? Or does the II allow them to proceed? 

The wording says that II is performed multiple times before proceeding to CA. So the loop is between FC and II. Wait, perhaps after FC, if they do II, then they can proceed to CA. Or maybe after II, they have to do FC again? 

Hmm, perhaps the process is:

FC  if doubt, do II  then check again (maybe another FC?), but the problem says "this can happen multiple times before proceeding to CA". So the II can be done multiple times. So the loop is between FC and II. Wait, perhaps the FC and II form a loop. 

Alternatively, after FC, if they do II, then they can proceed to CA. But if during II they find more issues, they might need to do another FC. 

Alternatively, perhaps the II is a separate step that doesn't require redoing FC. The problem states that II is performed when FC raises doubts, and this can be done multiple times. So the process after FC is:

FC  (if doubt, do II  then maybe FC again? Or proceed?)

The problem says "this can happen multiple times before proceeding to CA". So the II can be done multiple times, but each time after FC. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct way is that after FC, if there's a doubt, you do II, and then you have to do FC again. So the loop is FC  II  FC again. 

But that complicates the model. Alternatively, perhaps the II is a step that allows the process to proceed after FC, but can be done multiple times. 

Alternatively, perhaps the FC and II form a loop where after FC, you can choose to do II (which loops back to FC) or proceed to CA. 

Wait, the problem says "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)."

So the FC may require multiple II steps. So after FC, if there's a doubt, you do II. Then, perhaps after II, you have to do FC again? Or does the II resolve the doubt, allowing to proceed? 

The wording is unclear, but perhaps the simplest way is to model that after FC, you can choose to do II (which loops back to FC) or proceed to CA. So the II is a transition that takes you back to FC's place. 

Wait, let's model it as:

After FC, the token is in FC_place. From there, you can either:

- Proceed to CA (via CA transition)  CA_place.

OR 

- Do II (In-depth Investigation), which takes the token back to FC_place (so that FC can be done again? Or perhaps the II is part of the FC process. 

Alternatively, the II transition would take the token from FC_place back to FC_place, allowing multiple II steps. But then how does the FC get re-evaluated? 

Hmm, perhaps the II is a transition that loops back to FC_place, so after FC, you can do II any number of times (each time staying in FC_place) before choosing to proceed to CA. 

That way, the loop is between FC_place and the II transition. 

So the transitions from FC_place are:

- CA (to CA_place)

- II (stays in FC_place)

This allows multiple II steps before proceeding. 

That seems manageable. 

So the transitions for FC and II are:

II: FC_place  FC_place (so when II fires, the token remains in FC_place, allowing another II or CA to be chosen next).

So the model for FC and II is okay. 

Now, proceeding to the rest of the steps:

After CA_place, the next step is AP (Approval). Then P (Payment), then N (Notification), then CL (closure). 

So transitions:

AP: CA_place  AP_place

P: AP_place  P_place

N: P_place  N_place

Close: N_place  CL (the final place)

Now, the initial marking (im) has a token in S (start). 

The final marking (fm) has a token in CL. 

But we need to make sure that all the transitions are properly connected. 

Now, let's code this in Python using pm4py. 

First, create all the places and transitions. 

The places are:

S = PetriNet.Place(name="Start")

CR_done = PetriNet.Place(name="CR_done")

DV_place = PetriNet.Place(name="DV_place")

FC_place = PetriNet.Place(name="FC_place")

CA_place = PetriNet.Place(name="CA_place")

AP_place = PetriNet.Place(name="AP_place")

P_place = PetriNet.Place(name="P_place")

N_place = PetriNet.Place(name="N_place")

CL = PetriNet.Place(name="CL")

Transitions:

CR = PetriNet.Transition(name="CR", label="Claim Registration")

DV = PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification")

FC = PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Fraud Check")

RDS = PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission")

II = PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="In-depth Investigation")

CA = PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment")

AP = PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval")

P = PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment")

N = PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification")

Close = PetriNet.Transition(name="Close", label="Closure")

Now, adding arcs:

CR: from S to CR_done.

DV: from CR_done to DV_place.

FC: from DV_place to FC_place.

RDS: from DV_place to DV_place (loop).

II: from FC_place to FC_place (loop).

CA: from FC_place to CA_place.

AP: from CA_place to AP_place.

P: from AP_place to P_place.

N: from P_place to N_place.

Close: from N_place to CL.

Wait, but the Close transition's label is "Closure", and it takes from N_place to CL. 

Now, adding all these arcs using petri_utils.add_arc_from_to.

Now, the code steps:

First, import the necessary modules:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

Then create the net:

net = PetriNet(name="InsuranceClaimProcess")

Add all the places to the net:

places = [
    S, CR_done, DV_place, FC_place, CA_place, AP_place, P_place, N_place, CL
]

for p in places:
    net.places.add(p)

Add all transitions to the net:

transitions = [
    CR, DV, FC, RDS, II, CA, AP, P, N, Close
]

for t in transitions:
    net.transitions.add(t)

Now add the arcs:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(S, CR, net)  # CR's input is S

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CR_done, DV, net)  # DV's input is CR_done

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(DV_place, FC, net)  # FC's input is DV_place

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(DV_place, RDS, net)  # RDS's input is DV_place, output is DV_place

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(FC_place, II, net)  # II's input is FC_place, output is FC_place

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(FC_place, CA, net)  # CA's input is FC_place

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CA_place, AP, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(AP_place, P, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(P_place, N, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(N_place, Close, net)

Wait, but for the RDS transition, the output is DV_place. So the arc from RDS to DV_place must be added. 

Wait, the add_arc_from_to function adds an arc from the source to the transition, and the transition's output is the destination. Wait, no: the function's parameters are (source_place, transition, net), and the transition's output is the destination. Wait, the function's documentation says:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source_place, transition, net, target_place=None) ?

Wait, perhaps I need to check the parameters. The function add_arc_from_to(source, transition, net) adds an arc from the source place to the transition's output place. Wait, perhaps the function adds an arc from the source place to the transition, and the transition's output is the destination. Or maybe the function is add_arc_from_to(source_place, target_place, net), but with a transition in between?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the petri_utils functions. Let me think again. 

The standard way to add an arc from place A to place B via transition T is:

- The transition T has an input place A and output place B. 

To do this with petri_utils, perhaps the function add_arc_from_to(A, T, net) would set the input of T to A, and the output to some default? Or maybe the function adds an arc from A to T's output place. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function add_arc_from_to(source_place, transition, net) adds an arc from the source_place to the transition's input, and the transition's output is another place. Wait, perhaps the function is designed to add an arc from the source_place to the transition, and the transition's output is the target_place. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is add_arc_from_to(source_place, target_place, net), but that's not involving transitions. 

Hmm, perhaps I need to look up the pm4py's petri_utils.add_arc_from_to function. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use the add_arc_from_to function to connect a place to a transition, specifying the source and the transition, and the transition's output is another place. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function add_arc_from_to(source_place, transition, net) adds an arc from the source_place to the transition's input, and the transition's output is set to a default place. But that's unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is used as follows: to create an arc from place A to place B via transition T, you need to:

- Add T to the net.

- Add an arc from A to T (so T's input is A), and an arc from T to B (so T's output is B). 

But how to do that with the utils functions. 

Alternatively, the function add_arc_from_to(source, transition, net) adds an arc from the source place to the transition's input, and the transition's output is set to a new place? Or perhaps the function is designed to add an arc from the source to the transition, and the transition's output is the target. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is add_arc_from_to(source_place, target_place, net), and the transition is implied. But that's not the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use the following approach:

For each transition, specify its input and output places. 

For example, for the CR transition:

CR's input is S, output is CR_done. 

So to create that:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(S, CR, net)  # this would set the input of CR to S, and the output to some default? Or perhaps the output is automatically set to a new place unless specified. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function add_arc_from_to(source, transition, net) adds an arc from the source to the transition's input, and the transition's output is another place. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function add_arc_from_to(source_place, transition, net) adds an arc from the source_place to the transition's input place, and the transition's output is set to a new place. But this is unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use the following code for each transition's input and output:

For example, for the CR transition:

- The input place is S, output place is CR_done.

So:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(S, CR, net)  # this adds an arc from S to CR's input.

Then, the output of CR is CR_done. So perhaps we need to set the output place of CR to CR_done. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function add_arc_from_to(source, transition, net) adds an arc from the source to the transition's input, and the transition's output is the target. Wait, maybe the function is add_arc_from_to(source_place, target_place, net), and the transition is created between them. But that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions have their input and output places set via the add_arc_from_to function. 

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions in pm4py have their input and output places managed via the add_arc_from_to function. 

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions are created, and then for each transition, we add arcs from their input places and to their output places. 

Let me think of the CR transition:

The CR transition must have S as its input place and CR_done as its output place. 

To do this:

- Add an arc from S to CR (so CR's input is S).

- Add an arc from CR to CR_done (so CR's output is CR_done).

So using petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(S, CR, net) would add the first part (input), and then add_arc_from_to(CR, CR_done, net) would add the output. 

Wait, but the function's parameters are (source, transition, net) for the first part. Or perhaps the function is add_arc_from_to(source_place, transition, net) to add the input arc, and then add_arc_from_to(transition, target_place, net) to add the output arc. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function add_arc_from_to(source_place, target_place, net) creates a direct arc between them, but that doesn't involve a transition. 

Hmm, perhaps I need to refer to the pm4py documentation. Since I can't do that, I'll proceed with the assumption that to create a transition with input and output places, we need to add two arcs: one from the input place to the transition, and one from the transition to the output place. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function add_arc_from_to(source, transition, net) adds an arc from the source place to the transition's input, and the transition's output is automatically set to a new place unless specified. But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions in pm4py have their input and output places managed via the add_arc_from_to function. For example, to create a transition T with input place A and output place B:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(A, T, net)  # adds input arc A  T

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(T, B, net)  # adds output arc T  B

Yes, that makes sense. Because the first call adds an arc from A to T (so T's input is A), and the second adds an arc from T to B (so T's output is B). 

So for each transition, we need to add two arcs: input and output. 

Therefore, for the CR transition:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(S, CR, net)  # input is S

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CR, CR_done, net)  # output is CR_done

Similarly for other transitions:

DV transition:

input is CR_done  output is DV_place.

So:

add_arc_from_to(CR_done, DV, net)

add_arc_from_to(DV, DV_place, net)

FC transition:

input is DV_place  output is FC_place.

add_arc_from_to(DV_place, FC, net)

add_arc_from_to(FC, FC_place, net)

RDS transition:

input is DV_place  output is DV_place (loop).

So:

add_arc_from_to(DV_place, RDS, net)

add_arc_from_to(RDS, DV_place, net)

II transition:

input is FC_place  output is FC_place.

add_arc_from_to(FC_place, II, net)

add_arc_from_to(II, FC_place, net)

CA transition:

input is FC_place  output is CA_place.

add_arc_from_to(FC_place, CA, net)

add_arc_from_to(CA, CA_place, net)

AP transition:

input is CA_place  output is AP_place.

add_arc_from_to(CA_place, AP, net)

add_arc_from_to(AP, AP_place, net)

P transition:

input is AP_place  output is P_place.

add_arc_from_to(AP_place, P, net)

add_arc_from_to(P, P_place, net)

N transition:

input is P_place  output is N_place.

add_arc_from_to(P_place, N, net)

add_arc_from_to(N, N_place, net)

Close transition:

input is N_place  output is CL.

add_arc_from_to(N_place, Close, net)

add_arc_from_to(Close, CL, net)

Wait, but the Close transition's output is CL. So yes.

Now, putting all these together in code:

Let me write the code step by step.

First, create all the places and transitions as variables.

Then, add them to the net's places and transitions.

Then, add the arcs as described.

Now, the code:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet(name="InsuranceClaimProcess")

# Define places
S = PetriNet.Place(name="Start")
CR_done = PetriNet.Place(name="CR_done")
DV_place = PetriNet.Place(name="DV_place")
FC_place = PetriNet.Place(name="FC_place")
CA_place = PetriNet.Place(name="CA_place")
AP_place = PetriNet.Place(name="AP_place")
P_place = PetriNet.Place(name="P_place")
N_place = PetriNet.Place(name="N_place")
CL = PetriNet.Place(name="CL")

# Add places to the net
net.places.add(S)
net.places.add(CR_done)
net.places.add(DV_place)
net.places.add(FC_place)
net.places.add(CA_place)
net.places.add(AP_place)
net.places.add(P_place)
net.places.add(N_place)
net.places.add(CL)

# Define transitions
CR = PetriNet.Transition(name="CR", label="Claim Registration")
DV = PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification")
FC = PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Fraud Check")
RDS = PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission")
II = PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="In-depth Investigation")
CA = PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment")
AP = PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval")
P = PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment")
N = PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification")
Close = PetriNet.Transition(name="Close", label="Closure")

# Add transitions to the net
net.transitions.add(CR)
net.transitions.add(DV)
net.transitions.add(FC)
net.transitions.add(RDS)
net.transitions.add(II)
net.transitions.add(CA)
net.transitions.add(AP)
net.transitions.add(P)
net.transitions.add(N)
net.transitions.add(Close)

# Add arcs
# CR: S -> CR -> CR_done
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(S, CR, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CR, CR_done, net)

# DV: CR_done -> DV -> DV_place
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CR_done, DV, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(DV, DV_place, net)

# FC: DV_place -> FC -> FC_place
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(DV_place, FC, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(FC, FC_place, net)

# RDS: DV_place -> RDS -> DV_place (loop)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(DV_place, RDS, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(RDS, DV_place, net)

# II: FC_place -> II -> FC_place (loop)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(FC_place, II, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(II, FC_place, net)

# CA: FC_place -> CA -> CA_place
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(FC_place, CA, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CA, CA_place, net)

# AP: CA_place -> AP -> AP_place
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CA_place, AP, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(AP, AP_place, net)

# P: AP_place -> P -> P_place
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(AP_place, P, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(P, P_place, net)

# N: P_place -> N -> N_place
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(P_place, N, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(N, N_place, net)

# Close: N_place -> Close -> CL
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(N_place, Close, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(Close, CL, net)

Now, the initial marking (im) should have a token in the start place (S). 

im = Marking()
im[S] = 1

The final marking (fm) should have a token in CL. 

fm = Marking()
fm[CL] = 1

But wait, the problem says that the final marking should represent the closed claim. So yes, CL is the final place. 

However, the example in the prompt had a case where the sink place was removed. But in this case, the CL is the final place and remains. 

Now, the code should be correct. Let me check for any possible errors.

Wait, the RDS transition's output is DV_place. So when RDS fires, the token moves from DV_place (input) via RDS to DV_place (output). So the token remains in DV_place, allowing the loop. 

Similarly for II. 

The transitions for FC and CA: when the token is in FC_place, it can choose between FC's output (FC_place) via CA (which moves to CA_place) or via II (staying in FC_place). Wait, no: the FC transition's output is FC_place. Wait, the FC transition's output is FC_place. So when FC fires, the token moves to FC_place. Wait, no: the FC transition's output is FC_place. So the FC transition takes from DV_place to FC_place. So after FC fires, the token is in FC_place. Then, from there, the transitions available are II (which loops back to FC_place) and CA (which moves to CA_place). 

Yes, that's correct. 

The CA transition takes from FC_place to CA_place. 

The AP then proceeds as normal. 

The Close transition takes from N_place to CL. 

This should form a valid Petri net. 

Now, the code should be as written above. 

But I need to make sure that all the transitions and arcs are correctly added. 

Another thing to check: the transitions' labels. For example, the Close transition's label is "Closure", which is acceptable. 

The problem requires the transitions to be labeled with the activity names. The steps are:

Claim Registration (CR), Document Verification (DV), Fraud Check (FC), Re-Document Submission (RDS), In-depth Investigation (II), Claim Assessment (CA), Approval (AP), Payment (P), Notification (N), Closure (CL). 

The labels in the code match these names. 

The places are the states between transitions, which are named appropriately. 

The initial marking is im with S having 1 token. 

The final marking is fm with CL having 1 token. 

Thus, this should be the correct code.
</thought>

To solve this problem, we need to construct an accepting Petri net for a complex insurance claim management process. The Petri net must model the sequence of activities, including possible loops for re-document submission and in-depth investigations, and define the initial and final markings.

### Approach
1. **Identify Places and Transitions**: 
   - Places represent states between activities (e.g., start, after claim registration, after document verification, etc.).
   - Transitions represent the activities themselves (e.g., Claim Registration, Document Verification, etc.).
   
2. **Model Loops**:
   - **Re-Document Submission (RDS)**: If documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), the process loops back to DV. This is modeled by an arc from DV's place back to itself via the RDS transition.
   - **In-Depth Investigation (II)**: If fraud is suspected after Fraud Check (FC), the process loops back to FC. This is modeled by an arc from FC's place back to itself via the II transition.

3. **Construct the Petri Net**:
   - Define all places and transitions.
   - Connect transitions with arcs to form the sequence of activities and loops.
   - Ensure the initial marking starts with a token in the start place and the final marking ends with a token in the closure place.

```

### Explanation
- **Places**: Each place represents a state between transitions. For example, `DV_place` is the state after Document Verification.
- **Transitions**: Each transition corresponds to an activity, such as `CR` for Claim Registration.
- **Arcs**: Arcs connect places through transitions to model the flow. Loops are created using transitions like RDS and II that route back to their input places.
- **Initial Marking**: Starts with a token in the `Start` place, indicating a new claim.
- **Final Marking**: Ends with a token in `CL`, representing the claim being closed and archived.

This structure ensures the process flows through all required steps with possible loops for re-documentation and fraud checks, adhering to the problem's requirements.
