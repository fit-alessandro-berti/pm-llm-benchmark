- **Inform Applicant Timing:** The applicant was informed 48 hours and 30 minutes after the loan decision, which exceeds the recommended 48-hour window.
- **No Follow-up Call:** There is no evidence of a follow-up call before closing the case, which is recommended but not required.

### Interpretations and Justifications

**Case 2:**
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** This could indicate an error or oversight in the process where the Risk Assessment was mistakenly recorded before the Credit Check.
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** This might be due to a manual intervention or a system error that caused the Finalize Documentation step to be recorded after the rejection decision.

**Case 3:**
- **Credit Check Timing:** Delays in completing the Credit Check can happen due to unforeseen circumstances such as delays in obtaining necessary information or verifying the applicant's details.
- **Inform Applicant Timing:** Similar to Case 1, delays in informing the applicant could be due to administrative delays or system issues.
- **No Follow-up Call:** The lack of a follow-up call could be due to the internal policy not mandating it, or the team deciding it was unnecessary based on the context of the case.

### Summary

- **Normative Violations:**
  - **Case 2:** Violates the sequence by performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check and Finalizes Documentation after rejection.
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - **Case 1:** Exceeds the recommended time for informing the applicant.
  - **Case 3:** Exceeds the recommended time for Credit Check and informing the applicant, and lacks a follow-up call.

These observations help identify areas where the process can be improved to better adhere to both the strict rules and the recommended best practices.
