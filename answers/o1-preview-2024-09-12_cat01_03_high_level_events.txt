**High-Level Process Steps:**

---

### 1. Material Preparation

- **Events:**
  - **Retrieve raw metal sheet** (Operator A)
    - AdditionalInfo: PartID: M-045
  - **Scan barcode** (Operator A)
    - AdditionalInfo: Barcode: 12345
  - **Place metal sheet on table** (Operator A)
    - AdditionalInfo: TableID: T-3
  - **Align metal sheet** (Robot Arm #2)
    - AdditionalInfo: Alignment: Perfect
  - **Preheat metal sheet** (Heating Unit #1)
    - AdditionalInfo: Temperature: 200°C

- **Rationale:**
  - These events are all involved in preparing the raw material for the manufacturing process. They occur sequentially and are performed by Operator A and Robot Arm #2, focusing on setting up the metal sheet for assembly. This grouping represents a logical phase where the material is being prepared for subsequent processing steps.

### 2. Welding Assembly

- **Events:**
  - **Pick up welding tool** (Operator B)
    - AdditionalInfo: ToolID: W-12
  - **Weld corner A** (Operator B)
    - AdditionalInfo: WeldType: Spot
  - **Weld corner B** (Operator B)
    - AdditionalInfo: WeldType: Spot

- **Rationale:**
  - These events encompass the assembly phase where the product components are joined together through welding. Operator B performs these actions, indicating a shift in resource and activity type. This grouping captures the core assembly operations in the process.

---

### 3. Weld Quality Inspection

- **Events:**
  - **Measure weld integrity** (Quality Sensor #1)
    - AdditionalInfo: IntegrityScore: 95

- **Rationale:**
  - This event represents a quality control step specifically focused on the welding performed in the previous stage. Using Quality Sensor #1, the integrity of the welds is assessed to ensure they meet the required standards before proceeding. This inspection is critical to verify the success of the assembly process.

---

### 4. Coating Application

- **Events:**
  - **Apply protective coating** (Coating Unit #3)
    - AdditionalInfo: CoatingType: Polyurethane
  - **Dry coating** (Heating Unit #2)
    - AdditionalInfo: Temperature: 120°C

- **Rationale:**
  - These events are related to the application and curing of a protective coating on the assembled product. They are grouped together as they constitute the coating process, transforming the product's surface properties. This step follows the successful weld inspection and is necessary for product finishing.

---

### 5. Final Quality Inspection

- **Events:**
  - **Visual check** (Operator C)
    - AdditionalInfo: Check: Passed

- **Rationale:**
  - The final visual inspection is carried out by Operator C to ensure the completed product adheres to all quality standards. This step serves as a last verification before the product moves to packaging or distribution. It is a distinct phase focusing on overall product quality assessment.

---

**Summary of Groupings:**

- **Material Preparation:** Events 1-5, focusing on preparing the raw material.
- **Welding Assembly:** Events 6-8, involving the welding process to assemble components.
- **Weld Quality Inspection:** Event 9, assessing the quality of the welds.
- **Coating Application:** Events 10-11, applying and curing the protective coating.
- **Final Quality Inspection:** Event 12, performing a comprehensive visual quality check.

---

**Notes:**

- **Temporal Proximity:** The events within each high-level activity are temporally close, occurring in immediate succession.
- **Resource Type:** Each group often involves the same resource or resource type, indicating a logical division of labor (e.g., Operator A for material preparation, Operator B for welding).
- **Process Phase:** Each high-level activity represents a distinct phase in the manufacturing process, moving from preparation to assembly, quality checks, finishing, and final inspection.

---

By grouping the low-level events into these high-level activities, the manufacturing workflow becomes clearer, highlighting the main stages of the process:

1. **Material Preparation**
2. **Welding Assembly**
3. **Weld Quality Inspection**
4. **Coating Application**
5. **Final Quality Inspection**

This structured representation facilitates a better understanding of the process flow and aids in analyzing the efficiency and effectiveness of each stage in the manufacturing operation.
