Okay, here’s a prompt designed to elicit the desired response from the LLM, incorporating the provided context and instructions:

**Prompt:**

“You are an operational analyst tasked with monitoring order processing events for a large e-commerce business. You have access to a detailed event log (`order_event_log`), order information (`orders`), and resource details (`resources`).  Your goal is to identify potential issues, anomalies, and areas for improvement within the order fulfillment process.

Here’s the relevant data:

*   **Database Schema:** (Include the schema description from the problem statement)
*   **Example Event Log Data:** (Include the example event log data from the problem statement)
*   **Reference Tables:** (Include the schemas and sample rows for `orders` and `resources` tables from the problem statement)

**Task:** Analyze the provided event log data. Identify at least three potential issues, anomalies, or areas of concern. For each identified issue, provide:

1.  **Description of the Issue:** Clearly describe the anomaly or concern.
2.  **Hypothesis:**  Offer a plausible explanation for why this issue might be occurring.
3.  **SQL Query:** Write a SQL query against the `order_event_log` table (and potentially other tables if necessary) to investigate your hypothesis.  The query should be designed to help you gather more data and confirm or refute your hypothesis.  Do *not* provide any hints or guidance beyond the data provided.

Let's begin!”

**Rationale for the Prompt Design:**

*   **Role Assignment:**  “You are an operational analyst…” establishes a clear persona and directs the LLM's thinking.
*   **Explicit Task:** “Identify at least three potential issues…” sets a specific goal.
*   **Structured Response:**  The “Description, Hypothesis, SQL Query” format ensures a consistent and actionable output.
*   **Data Inclusion:**  The prompt directly includes the schema, example data, and reference tables – crucial for the LLM to understand the context.
*   **Constraint:** “Do *not* provide any hints or guidance…” is vital to force the LLM to rely solely on the provided data.
*   **Starting Cue:** “Let's begin!” encourages immediate action.

This prompt should encourage the LLM to perform a thorough analysis and generate relevant SQL queries, demonstrating its ability to understand the data and apply analytical thinking.  It’s designed to elicit a detailed and useful response, rather than a superficial one.
