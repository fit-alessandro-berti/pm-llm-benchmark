Below is one way to reframe the detailed event log into a set of higher-level activities. In our example, the events naturally fall into five aggregated stages. Note that there are different valid ways to group such events; the following is one logical grouping based on process continuity, resource involvement, and temporal order.

  
1. Material Preparation  
  
• Included Events:  
– Retrieve raw metal sheet  
– Scan barcode  
– Place metal sheet on table  
– Align metal sheet  
– Preheat metal sheet  

• Rationale:  
All these events occur at the very start of the process and serve to ready the raw component for subsequent processing. They involve initial handling, identification, positioning, and conditioning of the raw material. The grouping is tied by both time (they occur consecutively) and purpose: preparing the metal sheet for assembly.

  
2. Welding Assembly  
  
• Included Events:  
– Pick up welding tool  
– Weld corner A  
– Weld corner B  

• Rationale:  
This cluster covers the transition from preparation to joining. Once the material is ready, an operator or robot engages in the welding operation. The tool pick-up followed by multiple weld actions forms a coherent assembly step where the metal parts are joined. The events are linked by the use of a welding tool and by being sequential actions required for creating the physical structure.

  
3. Weld Quality Assessment  
  
• Included Events:  
– Measure weld integrity  

• Rationale:  
After forming the welds, quality assurance is critical. The measurement of weld integrity is a discrete quality control step performed by a sensor, making it a natural candidate for isolation as a quality check. This step ensures that the welding has met required standards before proceeding further.

  
4. Surface Finishing  
  
• Included Events:  
– Apply protective coating  
– Dry coating  

• Rationale:  
Once the structure is built and the welds are quality checked, additional finishing operations are performed. Applying a protective coating and then drying it are operations that prepare the product’s surface for durability and aesthetic quality. They share a purpose, are performed by dedicated resources (coating unit and heating unit), and occur in close succession.

  
5. Final Visual Inspection  
  
• Included Event:  
– Visual check  

• Rationale:  
This is the ultimate quality assurance step where the finished product is visually inspected. It serves as a final confirmation that the process—from material preparation all the way through to finishing—was completed successfully. Grouping this event separately emphasizes its role in verifying the overall outcome.

    "HighLevelActivity": "Material Preparation",
    "LowLevelEvents": [
      "Retrieve raw metal sheet",
      "Scan barcode",
      "Place metal sheet on table",
      "Align metal sheet",
      "Preheat metal sheet"
    ],
    "Rationale": "These events prepare and condition the raw material by handling, identifying, positioning, and preheating the metal sheet for further processing."
  },
  "Welding Assembly": {

    "LowLevelEvents": [
      "Pick up welding tool",
      "Weld corner A",
      "Weld corner B"

    "Rationale": "The welding operations, from tool pickup through the actual joining steps, are a distinct assembly process where different parts are fused together."

    "LowLevelEvents": [
      "Measure weld integrity"
    ],
    "Rationale": "This quality check, performed by a quality sensor, is critical to verify that the welding process meets required standards before moving on."

  "Surface Finishing": {
    "HighLevelActivity": "Surface Finishing",
    "LowLevelEvents": [
      "Apply protective coating",
      "Dry coating"
    ],
    "Rationale": "Finishing treats the surface of the assembled product ensuring durability and quality. Both coating application and drying are part of this subsequent step."
  },
  "Final Visual Inspection": {
    "HighLevelActivity": "Final Visual Inspection",
    "LowLevelEvents": [
      "Visual check"

    "Rationale": "After processing and finishing, a final visual inspection confirms overall quality and ensures that the finished product is acceptable."

Summary

By grouping the low-level machine events, operator actions, and system checks into these five coherent stages, it becomes much simpler to understand the overall manufacturing workflow. Each high-level step captures a distinct phase of the process—from initially preparing the materials to the final inspection of the finished good—providing a clearer view of the overall production lifecycle.
