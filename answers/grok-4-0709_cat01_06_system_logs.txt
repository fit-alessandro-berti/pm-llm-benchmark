### Transformed Process Mining Event Log

The transformed event log is provided below in a tabular format (as a markdown table for readability). Each row represents an event derived from the original system log. I have included the required attributes (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp) and two additional attributes (App and Details) where relevant to provide context for analysis—App captures the application, and Details includes specifics like typed keys, highlighted text, or action descriptions from the original log. This makes the log more useful for process mining tools like ProM or Celonis, where additional attributes can be used for filtering or conformance checking.

Events are listed in chronological order (matching the original timestamps). Cases are grouped logically as described in the explanation section below.

| Timestamp                | Case ID               | Activity Name        | App              | Details                              |

This event log can be exported to CSV or XES format for use in process mining tools.

### Explanation of Logic
- **Case Identification:** I grouped events into cases based on the window title (e.g., "Document1.docx" or "Email - Inbox"), as this represents coherent logical units of user work—such as editing a specific document, handling email in a browser window, reviewing a PDF, or updating a spreadsheet. This results in five cases, each capturing the lifecycle of interactions with that item. Events were assigned to a case if they occurred in or transitioned to that window. Gaps in time (e.g., initial focus on "Quarterly_Report.docx" followed by later resumption) are preserved, reflecting interrupted work sessions. This approach creates multiple analyzable cases, allowing process mining to reveal patterns like editing workflows or task interruptions across documents/tasks.
- **Activity Naming:** I translated low-level actions (e.g., "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SCROLL," "SWITCH") into higher-level, standardized names that describe process steps (e.g., "Edit Document" for typing in Word, "Review PDF" for scrolling in Adobe, "Send Reply" for sending email). Names are consistent within similar contexts (e.g., all Word typing is "Edit Document") but differentiated by app/task type for clarity. SWITCH and FOCUS events are mapped to "Start [Task]" or "Resume [Task]" to indicate task initiation or resumption, making the log suitable for discovering process models like editing cycles or review sequences. Details from the original log (e.g., typed keys) are moved to an additional attribute to avoid overly specific activity names while retaining usefulness.
- **Overall Narrative:** The log narrates a brief work session where the user edits documents, handles an email, reviews a PDF, updates a budget, and finalizes reports—likely part of a larger reporting process. This structure supports analysis of task switching, durations, and bottlenecks (e.g., interruptions in document editing). If alternative groupings were possible (e.g., one big "Work Session" case), I chose per-document/task for coherence and to enable multi-case mining insights.
