I'll follow the format you provided to answer the task.

**Violations of Normative Rules:**

1. **Case 2:** This case violates the normative rule "Sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case". The Credit Check is performed after the Risk Assessment, which is not allowed. This indicates that the system performed the risk assessment before the credit check, which could have led to incorrect or incomplete information.

2. **Case 2:** This case also violates the normative rule "Finalize Documentation must occur before Close Case" when the loan is rejected. Although the credit check is performed before the loan decision, the system still tries to finalize documentation after a rejection, which is not allowed.

3. **Case 3:** This case does not perform the Credit Check within the recommended 24 hours after the application is received, violating the desideratum "Credit Check must be completed within a short time window after the application is received". This is an example of a desideratum violation, but it is not a severe issue.

**Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions:**

1. **Case 3:** This case fails to meet the desideratum "Prompt Inform Applicant" as the loan decision is informed 8 hours after the loan decision is made, which is later than the recommended 48 hours.

2. **Case 3:** This case fails to meet the desideratum "Perform Follow-up Call to the applicant" as a follow-up call is not performed.

**Interpretations or Justifications:**

While the observed behaviors may not strictly follow the normative rules or desiderata conditions, they might be due to various reasons, such as:

* Inadequate system implementation or configuration
* Human error or oversight
* Urgency or high-priority cases that require expedited processing
* Insufficient training or awareness of the process among system operators

However, these reasons do not excuse the violations of the normative rules or desiderata conditions, and efforts should be made to address these issues and improve the system's behavior in line with the established constraints and recommendations.
