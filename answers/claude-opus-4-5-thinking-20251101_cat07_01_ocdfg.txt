# Process Mining Visualization Description

This image shows an **Object-Centric Process Model** (likely from a process mining tool) depicting an order management/procurement workflow.

## Key Components

### Object Types (Top of diagram)
Five different business object types are tracked:
- **PurchaseRequisitionItem** (2.0M objects)
- **SalesOrderItem** (3.5M objects)
- **PurchaseOrderItem** (5.0M objects)
- **VendorInvoiceItem** (1.2M objects)
- **ReturnOrderItem** (0.8M objects)

### Process Activities (with volumes)
| Activity | Volume |
|----------|--------|
| Create Requisition | 3.0M |
| Approve Requisition | 5.7M |
| Create Order | 8.5M |
| Pack Goods | 2.0M |
| Ship Goods | 1.8M |
| Send Order | 5.2M |
| Check Stock | 1.0M |
| Process Return | 0.8M |
| Approve Payment | 1.5M |
| Confirm Delivery | 1.7M |
| Create Invoice | 2.0M |
| Close Order | 1.7M |

### Flow Characteristics
- **Color-coded paths** represent different object types flowing through the process
- **Transition times** (in milliseconds) are shown on arrows between activities
- **Multiple start and end points** indicate parallel process streams
- The diagram shows both the **happy path** (main flow) and **exception handling** (returns, stock checks)

This visualization is typical of **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** or **Order-to-Cash (O2C)** process analysis.
