To address the prompt, we'll need to simulate or reason about the typical delays between various activities in the global supply chain process based on common industrial practices and assumptions. Since I don't have real data, I'll generate plausible estimates for these delays using hypothetical values. Below is a Python dictionary representing a simplified temporal profile for the given supply chain process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # ('SS', 'OP'): (120, 30),  # Example: SS to OP delay
    ('OP', 'RC)': (1800, 300),  # Order Placement -> Receive Components delay
    ('RC', 'QI)': (900, 200),  # Receive Components -> Quality Inspection delay
    ('QI', 'CA)': (600, 150),  # Quality Inspection -> Component Assembly delay
    ('CA', 'PT)': (900, 250),  # Component Assembly -> Product Testing delay
    ('PT', 'PK)': (1200, 200),  # Product Testing -> Packaging delay
    ('PK', 'WS)': (300, 100),  # Packaging -> Warehouse Storage delay
    ('WS', 'DT)': (2400, 400),  # Warehouse Storage -> Distribution delay
    ('DT', 'AS)': (1500, 300),  # Distribution -> After-Sales Support delay
    ('AS', 'None'): (1800, 400),  # After-Sales Support -> End of Process delay
}

# Example explanation for some pairs:
# ('OP', 'RC'): Delay from Order Placement to Receive Components could be around 1.8 hours on average, with a standard deviation of 300 seconds due to variability in supplier lead times and transport logistics.
# ('QI', 'CA'): Delay from Quality Inspection to Component Assembly is estimated at 600 seconds (10 minutes) on average, with a standard deviation of 150 seconds reflecting potential differences in assembly line efficiency.
# ('PT', 'PK'): Time taken from Product Testing to Packaging averages about 1200 seconds (20 minutes), with a 200-second standard deviation due to variations in packaging speed.

# The dictionary represents a simulated model of the supply chain process, focusing on the pairwise temporal relationships between activities.
```

This Python dictionary illustrates a simplified representation of the temporal profile for the given global supply chain process. Each key-value pair corresponds to an activity pair and their estimated average time with standard deviation. This profile assumes hypothetical delays based on typical industrial operation sequences.

In real-world applications, obtaining accurate temporal profiles would require detailed historical process data analysis, which would involve examining actual trace data from multiple executions of the supply chain process to compute precise averages and standard deviations for each activity pair.
