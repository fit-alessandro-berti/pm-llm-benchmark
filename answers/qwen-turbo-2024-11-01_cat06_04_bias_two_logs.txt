### Analysis of Bias in Event Logs

To identify bias in the event logs, we need to compare the processes and outcomes for both Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group). The key attributes to consider are `LocalResident`, `CommunityGroup`, `PreliminaryScore`, `ScoreAdjustment`, and the final `Decision`.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Group A (Protected Group):**
   - All cases do not involve any community group adjustments.
   - There is no score adjustment based on community membership.
   - Decisions are based solely on the preliminary scores without any additional boosts.

2. **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
   - Cases with a `CommunityGroup` receive an additional score adjustment (+10 points).
   - Cases with a `CommunityGroup` have higher final scores and are more likely to be approved.
   - Cases without a `CommunityGroup` do not receive any score adjustments and follow the same process as Group A.

### Detailed Comparison:

1. **Case P001 vs. U001:**
   - Both cases start with a preliminary score of 720.
   - P001 does not receive any score adjustment.
   - U001 receives a score adjustment of +10 points due to the `CommunityGroup` attribute.
   - Final score: P001 = 720, U001 = 730.
   - Final decision: P001 = Approved, U001 = Approved.

2. **Case P002 vs. U002:**
   - Both cases start with a preliminary score of 710.
   - P002 does not receive any score adjustment.
   - U002 does not receive any score adjustment either.
   - Final score: P002 = 710, U002 = 710.
   - Final decision: P002 = Rejected, U002 = Rejected.

3. **Case P003 vs. U003:**
   - Both cases start with preliminary scores of 740 and 695 respectively.
   - P003 does not receive any score adjustment.
   - U003 receives a score adjustment of +10 points due to the `CommunityGroup` attribute.
   - Final score: P003 = 740, U003 = 705.
   - Final decision: P003 = Approved, U003 = Approved.

### Manifestation of Bias:

The bias manifests primarily through the `ScoreAdjustment` column, which provides an additional boost to cases in Group B that belong to a `CommunityGroup`. This adjustment directly influences the final score and, consequently, the final decision.

- **Protected Group (Group A):** Cases do not receive any score adjustments based on community membership or residency status.
- **Unprotected Group (Group B):** Cases receive a score adjustment if they belong to a community group, leading to a higher final score and a higher likelihood of approval.

### Systematic Differences:

1. **Score Adjustment Impact:**
   - For Group B, the presence of a `CommunityGroup` results in a score boost, which can significantly alter the final outcome.
   - For Group A, there is no such mechanism, leading to a consistent scoring process without any external boosts.

2. **Final Decision Likelihood:**
   - Group B cases are more likely to be approved due to the additional score adjustments, even if their initial scores are lower.
   - Group A cases rely solely on their preliminary scores, which can lead to more rejections if the preliminary score is not high enough.

### Conclusion:

The event logs exhibit bias against Group A (Protected Group) compared to Group B (Unprotected Group). This bias is evident in the additional score adjustments provided to Group B cases belonging to a `CommunityGroup`. These adjustments systematically favor Group B cases, potentially leading to unfair advantages in the final decision-making process.
