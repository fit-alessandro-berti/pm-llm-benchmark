## Analysis and Activity Renaming

### 1. Identified Recurring Activities

After analyzing the event log, I've identified the following activities that appear multiple times within cases with different contextual meanings:

- **Verify Documents** - Appears twice in C001 and C003
- **Call Customer** - Appears twice in C002 and once in C003 with different purposes

### 2. Contextual Analysis and Renaming Strategy

#### **Verify Documents:**
- **First occurrence**: Initial verification attempt
- **Second occurrence**: Re-verification after additional information is provided

#### **Call Customer:**
- Different purposes: requesting documents, clarifying issues, confirming changes, or requesting physical presence

### 3. Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities

### 4. Justification of Naming Choices

#### **Verify Documents:**
- **"Verify Documents - Initial"**: First verification attempt in the process
- **"Verify Documents - Recheck"**: Re-verification after customer provides additional documents (C001)
- **"Verify Documents - Post-Adjustment"**: Re-verification after internal account adjustments (C003)

#### **Call Customer:**
- **"Call Customer - Request Docs"**: Outbound call specifically to request missing documentation
- **"Call Customer - Clarify Issue"**: Call to understand and resolve discrepancies
- **"Call Customer - Confirm Changes"**: Follow-up call to confirm completed adjustments
- **"Call Customer - Request Return"**: Call to request physical presence at branch

#### **Initiate Request:**
- **"Initiate Request - Branch"**: Distinguished the branch-initiated request from web portal submissions to highlight different entry channels

These naming conventions provide clear disambiguation by:
1. Adding purpose suffixes to indicate the specific intent of each activity
2. Using temporal indicators (Initial, Recheck, Post-Adjustment) for sequential activities
3. Maintaining consistency across cases while preserving unique contextual information
