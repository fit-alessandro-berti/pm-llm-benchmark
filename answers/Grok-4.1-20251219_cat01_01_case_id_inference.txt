### Inferred Case Groupings

By analyzing the events, we can group them into **three distinct cases** (patient journeys) based on consistent matching of:

- `patient_age` and `patient_gender`
- Logical sequence of activities (e.g., Registration → Triage → Tests/Consultation → Treatment → Discharge)
- Realistic timing progression (events for the same patient are in increasing timestamp order)
- Department consistency where applicable
- Resource and additional_info supporting the flow

Here are the three inferred cases:

#### Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER visit for leg fracture)
- ER registration → Triage → X-ray → Doctor consultation → Discharge

Events:
1. 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z | Register patient | Admin Clerk | ER | age=45, M | insurance=private  
4. 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z | Initial triage | Nurse Joy | ER | age=45, M | triage_code=3  
7. 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z | X-ray imaging | Radiology Tech | Radiology | age=45, M | body_part=left_leg  
12. 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z | Doctor consultation | Dr. Lee | ER | age=45, M | diagnosis=hairline_fracture  
15. 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z | Patient discharged | Ward Clerk | ER | age=45, M | followup=outpatient_clinic  

#### Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER visit for minor infection)
- ER registration → Triage → Lab test requested → Lab completed → Doctor consultation → Prescription → Discharge

Events:
2. 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z | Register patient | Admin Clerk | ER | age=62, F | insurance=public  
5. 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z | Initial triage | Nurse Mark | ER | age=62, F | triage_code=2  
8. 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z | Lab test requested | Dr. Smith | ER | age=62, F | test_type=blood_panel  
10. 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z | Lab test completed | Lab Technician | Laboratory | age=62, F | results=normal_levels  
11. 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z | Doctor consultation | Dr. Smith | ER | age=62, F | diagnosis=minor_infection  
14. 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z | Prescription created | Dr. Smith | ER | age=62, F | medication=antibiotics  
17. 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z | Patient discharged | Ward Clerk | ER | age=62, F | followup=pharmacy_pickup  

#### Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Scheduled knee surgery)
- Registration (in Surgery dept) → Doctor consultation → Surgery preparation → Surgery performed → Recovery → Discharge

Events:
3. 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z | Register patient | Admin Clerk | Surgery | age=28, M | insurance=private  
6. 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z | Doctor consultation | Dr. Lee | Surgery | age=28, M | reason=scheduled_knee_surgery  
9. 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z | Surgery preparation | Surgical Nurse | Surgery | age=28, M | prep_type=general_anesthesia  
13. 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z | Surgery performed | Dr. Lee | Surgery | age=28, M | procedure=arthroscopy  
16. 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z | Recovery room | Recovery Nurse | Surgery | age=28, M | condition=stable  
18. 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z | Patient discharged | Ward Clerk | Surgery | age=28, M | followup=physiotherapy_sessions  

### Summary
- **Case 1**: 45M – Emergency Room visit for hairline fracture in left leg.
- **Case 2**: 62F – Emergency Room visit for minor infection.
- **Case 3**: 28M – Scheduled knee arthroscopy in Surgery department.

All 18 events are accounted for and grouped into these three coherent, non-overlapping patient journeys. The interleaving occurs naturally due to parallel processing in different departments and by different resources, but patient demographics and activity sequences clearly separate the cases.
