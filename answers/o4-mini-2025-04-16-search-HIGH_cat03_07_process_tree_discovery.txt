Here is a compact processtree capturing the main sequence, the optional/repeating “requestinfo  revalidate” loop, and the final approval, confirmation and archival steps:

```
(
  “RA”,
  “VF”,
  “AE”,
  *(
    ,
    ( “RMI”, “VF” )
  ),
  “AD”,
  “SC”,
  “AC”
)
```

Explanation of the nodes:

- RA: Receive Application  
- VF: Validate Form  
- AE: Assess Eligibility  
- * (  , (RMI, VF) ):  
  -  is a silent step (no activity)  
  - This loop lets you iterate zero or more times through the sequence “RMI  VF” (Request Missing Info then reValidate Form)  
- AD: Approval Decision  
- SC: Send Confirmation  
- AC: Archive Case  

Semantics:

1. Execute RA  VF  AE.  
2. Enter the loop: first execute  (immediately), then either  
   - exit the loop and continue to AD, or  
   - perform RMI  VF and then repeat ( …) again.  
3. After exiting the loop, proceed with AD  SC  AC.  

This exactly allows 0, 1, or many repetitions of requesting missing information and re-validating before the final approval, confirmation and archival.
