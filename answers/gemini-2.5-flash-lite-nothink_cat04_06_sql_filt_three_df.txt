**Explanation:**

1.  **Outer Query:**
    *   `SELECT el.* FROM event_log el`: This selects all columns from the `event_log` table, aliased as `el`.
    *   `WHERE el.case_id NOT IN (...)`: This is the core filtering mechanism. It ensures that we only retrieve events whose `case_id` is *not* present in the subquery's result.

2.  **Subquery (Identifying Cases to Exclude):**
    *   `SELECT e1.case_id FROM event_log AS e1 ...`: This subquery aims to find `case_id`s that satisfy the exclusion criteria.
    *   **Self-Joins:** We join the `event_log` table with itself multiple times (`e1`, `e2`, `e3`) to find events that occur in sequence within the same `case_id`.
        *   `INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp`: Links `e1` to a subsequent event `e2` in the same case.
        *   `INNER JOIN event_log AS e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e2.timestamp < e3.timestamp`: Links `e2` to a subsequent event `e3` in the same case.
    *   **Activity Matching:**
        *   `WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'`
        *   `AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'`
        *   `AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'`: These conditions ensure we find the specific sequence of three activities.
    *   **Direct Succession Check (`NOT EXISTS`)**:
        *   `AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM event_log AS e_between WHERE e_between.case_id = e1.case_id AND e_between.timestamp > e1.timestamp AND e_between.timestamp < e3.timestamp AND e_between.activity NOT IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order'))`: This is crucial for ensuring direct succession. It checks if there are *any* other events (`e_between`) for the same `case_id` that occur *after* `e1` and *before* `e3`, and are *not* one of the three target activities themselves. If such an event exists, the `NOT EXISTS` condition fails, and this combination of `e1`, `e2`, `e3` is not considered.
    *   **Timing Condition:**
        *   `AND JULIANDAY(e3.timestamp) - JULIANDAY(e2.timestamp) > 5`: This condition checks the time difference between the 'Create Order' event (`e2`) and the 'Confirm Order' event (`e3`). `JULIANDAY()` is used in DuckDB to get the number of days since a reference point, allowing for easy date subtraction. We check if this difference is strictly greater than 5 days.

The subquery effectively identifies `case_id`s that *do* contain the problematic sequence with the specified timing. The outer query then excludes all events belonging to these `case_id`s, leaving only the events from cases that do *not* meet the exclusion criteria.
