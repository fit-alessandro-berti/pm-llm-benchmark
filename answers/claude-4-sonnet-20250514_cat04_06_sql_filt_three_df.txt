Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Find cases with the exact sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' in direct succession
2. Among those, identify cases where 'Create Order' to 'Confirm Order' takes more than 5 days
3. Exclude all events from such cases from the final result

Here's my solution:

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as rn
    FROM event_log
),

-- Find sequences of the three target activities in direct succession
target_sequences AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        e1.case_id,
        e2.timestamp as create_order_time,
        e3.timestamp as confirm_order_time
    FROM ordered_events e1
    JOIN ordered_events e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.rn = e1.rn + 1
    JOIN ordered_events e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.rn = e2.rn + 1
    WHERE 
        e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),

-- Filter to only sequences where Create Order -> Confirm Order takes more than 5 days
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM target_sequences
    WHERE confirm_order_time - create_order_time > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

-- Return all events except those from excluded cases
SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ordered_events CTE**: Creates a row number for each event within each case, ordered by timestamp, to identify direct succession.

2. **target_sequences CTE**: Uses three-way self-joins on consecutive row numbers to find cases where:
   - 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is immediately followed by
   - 'Create Order' which is immediately followed by  
   - 'Confirm Order'
   
   This ensures the exact sequence with no intervening events.

3. **cases_to_exclude CTE**: From the sequences found, filters to only those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.

4. **Final SELECT**: Returns all events from the original table except those belonging to the excluded cases, properly ordered by case and timestamp.

The query handles edge cases like:
- Cases with multiple occurrences of the sequence (uses DISTINCT)
- Ensures exact ordering through row number joins
- Proper datetime arithmetic for the 5-day condition
- Clean exclusion of entire cases that match both criteria
