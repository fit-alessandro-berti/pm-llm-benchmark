### **1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Constraints)**
Normative rules are **mandatory**, and any deviation is a **serious violation**. Below are the cases that violate these rules:

#### **Case 2: Multiple Violations**
- **Violation 1:** *Risk Assessment* occurred **before** *Credit Check*.
  - **Constraint Breached:** Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
  - **Observed Sequence:**
    `Application Received  Risk Assessment  Credit Check`
    (Incorrect order; should be `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment`)

- **Violation 2:** *Finalize Documentation* was performed **after a rejection**.
  - **Constraint Breached:** If the loan is rejected, documentation must **not** be finalized before closing.
  - **Observed Sequence:**
    `Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`
    (Should have been `Loan Decision (Rejected)  Close Case` without finalization.)

#### **Case 1 & Case 3: No Normative Violations**
- Both cases follow the **strict sequence** correctly:
  - **Case 1:**
    `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`
  - **Case 3:**
    `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`
  - No skipped steps, no incorrect ordering, and no contradictory actions.

### **2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended but Not Strict)**
Desiderata are **best practices**, and deviations are **suboptimal but not severe**. Below are the cases that fail to meet these recommendations:

#### **Case 3: Multiple Desiderata Violations**
- **Violation 1:** *Credit Check* took **>24 hours** after *Application Received*.
  - **Desideratum:** Credit Check should ideally be completed within 24 hours.
  - **Observed Timing:**
    - Application Received: `2024-01-12 09:00`
    - Credit Check: `2024-01-14 10:00` (**~49 hours later**)
  - **Possible Justification:**
    - High workload, missing documentation, or external delays (e.g., credit bureau response time).

- **Violation 2:** *Inform Applicant* took **>48 hours** after *Loan Decision*.
  - **Desideratum:** Applicant should be informed within 48 hours of the decision.
  - **Observed Timing:**
    - Loan Decision: `2024-01-14 12:00`
    - Inform Applicant: `2024-01-16 15:00` (**~51 hours later**)
  - **Possible Justification:**
    - Administrative delays, applicant unavailability, or internal communication issues.

- **Violation 3:** **No Follow-up Call** before closing the case.
  - **Desideratum:** A follow-up call is encouraged before closing.
  - **Observed Behavior:**
    - Case closed without any follow-up.
  - **Possible Justification:**
    - Low-priority case, applicant did not request clarification, or process oversight.

#### **Case 1: No Desiderata Violations**
- **Credit Check:** Completed within **30 minutes** (well within 24 hours).
- **Inform Applicant:** Completed **2 hours** after the decision (well within 48 hours).
- **Follow-up Call:** Not explicitly logged, but since it’s only **recommended**, its absence is **not a violation** (unlike Case 3, where other desiderata were also missed).

#### **Case 2: Desiderata Not Applicable (Due to Normative Violations)**
- Since Case 2 already has **serious normative violations**, desiderata compliance is **moot** (though we can still observe timing):
  - **Credit Check:** Completed **20 minutes** after *Risk Assessment* (but this is already wrong per normative rules).
  - **Inform Applicant:** Not logged (but normative violations take precedence).

### **3. Summary of Findings**

| **Case** | **Normative Violations?** | **Details of Normative Violations** | **Desiderata Violations?** | **Details of Desiderata Violations** |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **1**    |  No                      | Follows strict sequence correctly. |  No                       | Meets all timing recommendations.   |
| **2**    |  **Yes**                 | 1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check. <br> 2. Finalized docs after rejection. |  Irrelevant (normative violations take priority) | N/A |
| **3**    |  No                      | Follows strict sequence correctly. |  **Yes** (suboptimal)     | 1. Credit Check >24h after application. <br> 2. Inform Applicant >48h after decision. <br> 3. No follow-up call. |

### **4. Possible Interpretations & Justifications**
#### **For Normative Violations (Case 2):**
- **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check:**
  - Possible **human error** (e.g., analyst mistakenly started risk assessment early).
  - **System glitch** (e.g., process engine allowed out-of-order execution).
  - **Urgent case handling** (e.g., high-priority applicant, but this still violates rules).

- **Finalizing Docs After Rejection:**
  - **Miscommunication** (e.g., decision was initially approved but later reversed, but docs were already in progress).
  - **Process oversight** (e.g., employee forgot to check decision before finalizing).

#### **For Desiderata Violations (Case 3):**
- **Delayed Credit Check & Applicant Notification:**
  - **External dependencies** (e.g., credit bureau delays, applicant unresponsiveness).
  - **Resource constraints** (e.g., understaffing leading to backlog).
  - **Non-urgent case** (e.g., low-priority loan with flexible timelines).

- **Missing Follow-up Call:**
  - **Low perceived need** (e.g., applicant already confirmed understanding).
  - **Process inefficiency** (e.g., follow-ups are manually triggered and sometimes skipped).

### **5. Recommendations for Improvement**
1. **For Normative Compliance:**
   - Implement **automated workflow enforcement** (e.g., BPMN engine that blocks out-of-order steps).
   - Add **validation checks** (e.g., system prevents "Finalize Documentation" if decision = "Rejected").
   - **Training & audits** to ensure employees understand mandatory sequences.

2. **For Desiderata Adherence:**
   - Set **soft deadlines with alerts** (e.g., notify if Credit Check isn’t done within 24h).
   - **Automate follow-up reminders** (e.g., system suggests a call before case closure).
   - **Monitor desiderata compliance** in reports to identify recurring issues.

3. **General Process Optimization:**
   - **Root-cause analysis** for delays (e.g., why was Case 3’s Credit Check late?).
   - **Escalation paths** for urgent cases to prevent normative violations.
   - **Clear documentation** distinguishing **mandatory vs. recommended** steps.

---
### **Final Answer**
- **Normative Violations:**
  - **Only Case 2** violates strict rules (incorrect order + finalizing docs after rejection).
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - **Only Case 3** fails to meet best practices (delays + missing follow-up).
- **Case 1** is **fully compliant** with both normative and desiderata conditions.
