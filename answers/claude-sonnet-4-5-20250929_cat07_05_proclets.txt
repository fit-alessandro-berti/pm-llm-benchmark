# Visualization Description

This image shows a **Proclet-based workflow system** with three main components:

## (a) Two Proclet Classes Connected Through Channels

The main diagram displays a complex workflow with two interconnected process classes:

### Left Side - Lab Visit Process:
- Starts with actors: doctor, assistant, and lab assistant
- Flow begins with "Order entry" and blood sample collection
- Proceeds through "Receive result" and "Judge results" activities
- Includes a loop for retesting ("Do tests again" and "Receive updated result")
- Ends with "Send report" activity
- Contains decision points (circles with diamonds) for flow control

### Right Side - Lab Test Process:
- Involves chemical analyst role
- Includes "Perform test" and "Make report" activities
- Can loop back for updated reports ("Perform test again" and "Create updated report")
- Connected to chemical analyst at multiple points

### Communication Channels:
- **Dashed boxes** represent the "Order system" and "HIS" (Hospital Information System)
- **Labeled connectors** (1:1, 1:*, 0:1, 0:*) show cardinality relationships between processes
- Arrows indicate message flow and process dependencies

## (b) Class Diagram
Shows simplified relationship: "Lab visit" (1:1) requires "Lab test"

## (c) Example Performative Table
A data table showing:
- **Time**: 11:00
- **Channel**: Order system
- **Sender**: Lab visit - John
- **Receivers**: Lab test - HGB John
- **Action**: Create
- **Content**: "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
- **Scope**: Private
- **Direction**: OUT

This demonstrates message-passing between proclet instances in the workflow system.
