Here is the updated `declare_model` with a set of bias-mitigating constraints.  Every new entry has `"support": 1.0` and `"confidence": 1.0` to match the original style.

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication":    {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision":       {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication":    {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        # original
        "StartApplication":    {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # fairness: any minority decision must be paired with a ManualReview
        "Approve_Minority":    {"ManualReview":    {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority":     {"ManualReview":    {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        # original
        "StartApplication":    {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # fairness: whenever a sensitiveattribute check occurs, eventually do a BiasMitigationCheck
        "CheckApplicantRace":   {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},

    },
    "precedence": {
        # fairness: no decision before performing a BiasMitigationCheck
        "Approve": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject":  {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        # original
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },

        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge":    {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "chainprecedence": {
        # fairness: any Approve/Reject must be immediately preceded by a BiasMitigationCheck
        "Approve": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject":  {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        # fairness: forbid a sensitiveattribute check to be immediately followed by a decision
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "Reject":  {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "CheckApplicantGender": {
            "Reject":  {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "CheckApplicantAge": {
            "Reject":  {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

Rationale for the new constraints:

1. Coexistence (Approve_Minority  ManualReview, Reject_Minority  ManualReview)  
   Ensures that any outcome tagged “_Minority” is always accompanied by an explicit manual review step.

2. Response & ChainResponse (CheckApplicantX  BiasMitigationCheck)  
   Guarantees that every time we inspect a sensitive attribute (race, gender, age), a dedicated bias-mitigation check must eventually—and even immediately—follow.

3. Precedence & ChainPrecedence (Approve/Reject  BiasMitigationCheck)  
   Prevents any approval or rejection decision from occurring before (or immediately without) having done a bias-mitigation check.

4. Nonsuccession (CheckApplicantX  Approve/Reject)  
   Forbids the model from ever going directly from a sensitive attribute check into a decision, closing loopholes around “immediate” bias.

Together these constraints make sure that sensitiveattribute information doesn’t directly drive accept/reject decisions without an intervening, recorded biasmitigation step, and that any minority-tagged outcome is double-checked by hand.
