Got it  — I’ll integrate all the data sources and produce a **chronological event log** where each row is one event in the lifecycle of an `order_id` (case).  

I’ll follow these rules:

- **Case ID** = `order_id`  
- **Activity Name** derived from context (Order creation, item picking, dispatch, arrival, invoicing, payments).  
- **Timestamp** taken directly from relevant date columns.  
- **Resource** resolved from the *Resources Table*. For carriers, resource name is the carrier company.  
- **Other Attributes** = include relevant details (item, quantity, notes, etc.).  
- Multiple events per order if multiple items/deliveries/invoices occur.
- Events are sorted **chronologically per case** (Process Mining ready).

##  **Assumptions Made**
1. **Resource Mapping**  
   - Sales handled by `sales_person_id` from Orders Table.  
   - Picking done by `picker_id` in Order Lines table.  
   - Dispatch/arrival done by `carrier_id`.  
   - Invoicing by `billing_person_id`.  
   - Payments resource is the *payment method* (where person not known).

2. **Multiple Events Same Timestamp**  
   - Kept them as separate rows; sequence in table doesn’t imply within-second ordering.

3. **Order Lifecycle**  
   - Not all orders have deliveries/invoices/payments (e.g., 1004 missing deliveries/invoices/payments in provided data).

4. **Carriers Handling Arrival**  
   - Arrival assumed to be performed by same carrier that dispatched it.

If you want, I can **export this event log into a CSV or XES file** so it can be directly loaded into *ProM* or *Disco* for process mining.  

Do you want me to prepare that export next?
