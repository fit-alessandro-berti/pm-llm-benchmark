We are given a normative process description and an event log with 5 cases. We need to identify which cases violate the normative process and explain the violations.

First, let's summarize the normative process rules as clearly as possible:

- The process always begins with "Receive order".
- Next, "Check inventory" must occur before any decisions about payment authorization or fulfillment.
- Two main branches:
  - If inventory is sufficient: After "Check inventory", proceed to "Authorize payment", then "Package items", then "Ship order", then "Close order". So sequence: Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Package -> Ship -> Close.
  - If inventory is insufficient: After "Check inventory", proceed to "Cancel order", then "Close order". So sequence: Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close.
- Specific constraints:
  - "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging.
  - "Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping.
  - "Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.
  - "Close order" should be the final activity in all scenarios.
- Violations: shipping after cancellation, authorizing payment before checking inventory, packaging items before authorization, etc.

Now, we examine each case:

Case 1:
- Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order.
- This follows the sufficient inventory branch exactly. No violation.

Case 2:
- Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Package items, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
- Here, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment". According to the rules: "Package items" should only occur after authorization. So this is a violation. Also, the normative description says: "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping." So packaging before authorization is not allowed. Additionally, it says: "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging." Here authorization occurs after packaging, so that might also be a violation of the intended order (authorization before packaging). So Case 2 violates the process.

Case 3:
- Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order.
- This case is interesting. It starts like the sufficient branch (with Authorize payment after Check inventory), but then it goes to Cancel order. According to the description, if inventory is insufficient, we go directly from Check inventory to Cancel order, without Authorize payment. But here, Authorize payment occurs before Cancel. The description says: "If the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order, the process must branch into a cancellation scenario. In such a case, after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to 'Cancel order'." That implies that if we cancel, we should not authorize payment. So having Authorize payment before Cancel is a deviation. Also, after Cancel, we have Ship order. The description explicitly says: "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation." So shipping after cancellation is a violation. Additionally, note that there is no "Package items" before "Ship order", which is also required for shipping. So multiple violations: (1) Authorize payment before cancellation in a cancellation scenario (or perhaps the scenario is inconsistent: we authorized payment but then canceled, which might be allowed? The description says payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known. If inventory is sufficient, we shouldn't cancel; if insufficient, we shouldn't authorize. So authorizing and then canceling is not in the normative description. It might be a deviation if inventory was initially thought sufficient but then something else caused cancellation? But the description doesn't cover that; it assumes cancellation is due to insufficient inventory. So we interpret strictly: after check inventory, if insufficient, go to cancel; if sufficient, go to authorize. So here, after check, we have authorize, which implies inventory was sufficient, but then cancel is not part of the sufficient branch. So it's a violation. (2) Shipping after cancellation is explicitly forbidden. (3) Shipping without packaging is also a violation. So Case 3 violates.

Case 4:
- Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Cancel order, Close order.
- This follows the insufficient inventory branch exactly. No violation.

Case 5:
- Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
- Missing "Package items" between Authorize payment and Ship order. The description says: "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping." So shipping should occur only after packaging. Here, we have no packaging activity, so shipping directly after authorization is a violation. Also, the normative sequence for sufficient inventory requires packaging before shipping. So Case 5 violates.

Thus, violating cases: 2, 3, and 5. Case 1 and 4 are correct.

Now, we need to explain the violations for each violating case.

Let's write the answer.

### Identified Violations

Based on the normative process description, the following cases contain deviations:

- **Case 2** violates the process.
- **Case 3** violates the process.
- **Case 5** violates the process.

Cases 1 and 4 conform to the expected flows.

### Explanation of Violations

#### Case 2
- **Observed sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
- **Violations:**
  1. **Packaging before payment authorization:** The normative description states that "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping." Here, packaging is performed before authorization, which is not allowed.
  2. **Payment authorization after packaging:** The description also specifies that "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging." Since authorization occurs after packaging, this violates the intended order where authorization must precede packaging.

#### Case 3
- **Observed sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order.
- **Violations:**
  1. **Payment authorization before cancellation in a cancellation scenario:** The normative process indicates that if inventory is insufficient, the process should proceed directly from "Check inventory" to "Cancel order" without authorizing payment. Authorizing payment implies inventory was sufficient, but then canceling contradicts that branch. The description does not allow for authorization followed by cancellation.
  2. **Shipping after cancellation:** It is explicitly stated that "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation." Here, shipping occurs after cancellation, which is prohibited.
  3. **Shipping without packaging:** The normative process requires packaging before shipping. This case skips the "Package items" activity entirely before shipping, further deviating from the expected flow.

#### Case 5
- **Observed sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
- **Violations:**
  1. **Missing packaging before shipping:** According to the description, after authorization, the process must include "Package items" before "Ship order." The sequence skips packaging entirely, which violates the rule that "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping."

### Additional Notes

- The normative description implies that the two branches (sufficient vs. insufficient inventory) are mutually exclusive and follow strict sequences. Any deviation from these sequences, including missing activities, out-of-order activities, or incompatible combinations, constitutes a violation.
- Ambiguities in the description (e.g., whether payment authorization can ever occur before inventory check or in cancellation scenarios) were resolved by adhering strictly to the stated constraints and the explicit sequences provided.
