Let's build an integrated, detailed, and chronological event log by combining all tables.  
We will treat `order_id` as **Case ID**.  
We derive activities per above and add **Resource** using the resource table.  
Where multiple events happen per case, we show each explicitly — e.g., each pick, each invoice, payment part etc.

---

### **Assumptions**

- Multiple deliveries/invoices/payments per order  multiple events per order.
- Picking lines are listed individually by item; each is an event.
- Delivery split into dispatched & arrived events (two per `delivery_id`).
- Same for payments, even split payments  multiple events.
- Customer info used as extra attributes.
- No order cancellations or exceptions shown, so only positive flows.
- Carrier name used as Resource for dispatch and arrival.
- Attributes included where meaningful (like amount, quantity, picking info).
- Orders missing deliveries, invoices, or payments have no respective events (not appearing here since all seem covered).
- Columns: 
  - `Case ID`
  - `Activity Name`
  - `Timestamp`
  - `Resource`
  - `Additional Attributes` (optional: invoice/payment IDs, notes, quantities, customer info, etc.).
