**Answer:**

A trace that the model would erroneously accept but that violates domain logic is:

```
[Receive_Order, Cancel_Order, Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order, Close_Order]
```

**Why this trace is invalid:**

1. The logic tree forces `Authorize_Payment  Package_Items  Ship_Order` to occur *before* `Close_Order`.
2. Yet `Cancel_Order` appears between `Receive_Order` and `Check_Inventory`, while `Authorize_Payment` appears after `Cancel_Order` and still manages to execute — something the model permits.
3. In reality, once a customer initiates a cancellation (`Cancel_Order`) the order must be terminated immediately; no downstream activities (Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order) should ever execute once a cancellation has been issued.

Thus the trace “receivers the order, cancels it, *but still authorizes payment and fulfils the order”*, which is procedurally impossible in a real Order-to-Cash system.
