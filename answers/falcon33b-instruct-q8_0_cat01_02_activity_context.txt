**Justification for Renamed Activities:**

- **Submit Request**: Initially, this activity is generic and refers to any submission of a request. Renaming it makes it clear that this is the point at which customers submit their initial requests either online or in person.
  
- **Verify Docs**: In various cases, this refers to both verifying documents at different stages (initial verification, re-verification post-upload) and also checking IDs physically (for walk-in cases). The renaming reflects these varied contexts: "Verify Identity" for initial online verifications and "Physical ID Verification" for physical encounters.

- **Request Missing Docs**: When the verification process is incomplete initially, this activity clarifies the action taken by calling out to request additional documentation.

- **Upload ID Scan**: This highlights the specific task of uploading scanned IDs that customers submit after initial verification attempts.

- **Clarify Account Info**: Following an inbound call, this activity indicates gathering further account details or clarifications needed for internal adjustments.

- **Adjust Details**: Post a phone call, this activity denotes making necessary changes to account information internally.

- **Confirm Adjustments**: This term is used after follow-up calls to ensure that the corrections made are reflected accurately.

- **Correct Info**: When an error leads to missing info internally, correcting it is more descriptive than simply stating "Adjust Details".

- **Re-Verify Docs**: After internal adjustments, a second round of document verification ensures everything is correct, hence labeled distinctly from initial verifications.
