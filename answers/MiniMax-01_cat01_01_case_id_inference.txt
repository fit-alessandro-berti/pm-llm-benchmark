To group the events into separate cases based on the provided attributes and logical sequence, we need to analyze the data step by step. Here's a detailed breakdown of how we can infer the case groupings:

### Step 1: Identify the Initial Events
The first event in each case is typically the "Register patient" activity. From the data, we have three "Register patient" events:

1. **Event 1**: `Register patient` at `08:05:13Z` for a 45-year-old male in the ER.
2. **Event 2**: `Register patient` at `08:07:02Z` for a 62-year-old female in the ER.
3. **Event 3**: `Register patient` at `08:07:15Z` for a 28-year-old male in the Surgery department.

These three events represent the start of three distinct cases.

### Step 2: Group Events by Patient Attributes
We can use the `patient_age` and `patient_gender` attributes to group subsequent events. Additionally, the `department` and `activity` sequence will help us determine the flow of each case.

#### Case 1: 45-year-old Male
- **Event 1**: `Register patient` at `08:05:13Z` (ER)
- **Event 4**: `Initial triage` at `08:10:50Z` (ER) with triage_code=3
- **Event 8**: `Lab test requested` at `08:16:10Z` (ER)
- **Event 15**: `Patient discharged` at `08:30:05Z` (ER) with followup=outpatient_clinic

This case follows a typical ER visit flow: registration, triage, lab test, and discharge.

#### Case 2: 62-year-old Female
- **Event 2**: `Register patient` at `08:07:02Z` (ER)
- **Event 5**: `Initial triage` at `08:12:29Z` (ER) with triage_code=2
- **Event 9**: `Lab test completed` at `08:20:27Z` (Laboratory)
- **Event 11**: `Doctor consultation` at `08:22:54Z` (ER) with diagnosis=minor_infection
- **Event 14**: `Prescription created` at `08:27:00Z` (ER) with medication=antibiotics
- **Event 17**: `Patient discharged` at `08:35:29Z` (ER) with followup=pharmacy_pickup

This case involves a more detailed ER visit, including a lab test, doctor consultation, prescription, and discharge.

#### Case 3: 28-year-old Male
- **Event 3**: `Register patient` at `08:07:15Z` (Surgery)
- **Event 6**: `Doctor consultation` at `08:13:00Z` (Surgery) with reason=scheduled_knee_surgery
- **Event 7**: `X-ray imaging` at `08:15:42Z` (Radiology) with body_part=left_leg
- **Event 10**: `Surgery preparation` at `08:16:45Z` (Surgery) with prep_type=general_anesthesia
- **Event 13**: `Surgery performed` at `08:25:19Z` (Surgery) with procedure=arthroscopy
- **Event 16**: `Recovery room` at `08:31:37Z` (Surgery) with condition=stable
- **Event 18**: `Patient discharged` at `08:40:13Z` (Surgery) with followup=physiotherapy_sessions

This case involves a scheduled surgery, including pre-surgery consultation, imaging, preparation, surgery, recovery, and discharge.

### Step 3: Summary of Case Groupings
Based on the analysis, the events can be grouped into the following three cases:

#### Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER Visit)
- **Event 1**: Register patient
- **Event 4**: Initial triage
- **Event 8**: Lab test requested
- **Event 15**: Patient discharged

#### Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER Visit)
- **Event 2**: Register patient
- **Event 5**: Initial triage
- **Event 9**: Lab test completed
- **Event 11**: Doctor consultation
- **Event 14**: Prescription created
- **Event 17**: Patient discharged

#### Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Surgery)
- **Event 3**: Register patient
- **Event 6**: Doctor consultation
- **Event 7**: X-ray imaging
- **Event 10**: Surgery preparation
- **Event 13**: Surgery performed
- **Event 16**: Recovery room
- **Event 18**: Patient discharged

### Final Case Groupings
| Case ID | Events |
|---------|--------|
| Case 1  | 1, 4, 8, 15 |
| Case 2  | 2, 5, 9, 11, 14, 17 |
| Case 3  | 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18 |

This grouping ensures that each event is assigned to the correct patient journey based on the attributes and logical sequence of activities.
