<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to create an accepting Petri net for this insurance claim process. Hmm. Let's start by understanding the scenario.

The process starts with the Insurance Claim (C), then goes through several steps. Let me list out all the steps mentioned:

1. Claim Registration (CR)
2. Document Verification (DV)
3. Fraud Check (FC)
4. Claim Assessment (CA)
5. Approval (AP) – only if amount exceeds threshold
6. Payment (P)
7. Notification (N)
8. Closure (CL)

But there are some loops:

- If documents are incomplete after DV, re-submission (RDS) happens before continuing. So after DV, maybe there's a loop back to RDS and then back to DV?

Wait, the problem says: "if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs (RDS) before the process continues." So after DV, if documents are incomplete, they need to resubmit. So the flow would be DV  RDS  DV again? Or maybe RDS is part of the process after DV fails.

Similarly, for Fraud Check (FC), if doubts are raised, in-depth investigation (II) is performed, which can happen multiple times before proceeding to CA. So FC might loop back to II multiple times.

So, let's outline the main path first. Let's think of the standard flow without loops.

Start  CR  DV  FC  CA  AP  P  N  CL.

But there's a loop between DV and RDS. So when DV is done, maybe there's a check: if documents are complete, proceed to FC. If not, go to RDS, then back to DV? So RDS would be a transition that leads back to DV.

Similarly, for FC: if fraud check passes, proceed to CA. If doubts, then do II, then go back to FC. So FC  II  FC loop.

But the problem says "this can happen multiple times before proceeding to CA". So after II, it might go back to FC again.

Also, Approval (AP) is only when the amount surpasses a threshold. So perhaps CA leads to AP only if amount is high. Wait, but how to model that? Because maybe AP is optional. So CA might have two paths: one where AP is needed (if amount high), and another where it's not. But the problem says "the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So maybe CA determines whether AP is needed. So CA could lead to AP if threshold exceeded, else directly to P.

But how to model that in Petri net? Maybe using a choice point. So after CA, there's a choice: if amount is above threshold, then AP, else go to P. But Petri nets don't have conditional branching like that. Wait, in Petri nets, the transitions can have conditions, but usually the structure is designed with places that represent the state.

Alternatively, maybe CA leads to a place that then branches into AP or directly to P. But how? Let's think.

Wait, maybe after CA, there's a decision point. So CA transitions to a place that represents "amount over threshold" or not. But perhaps in the Petri net model, the AP transition is only enabled when the amount is over threshold. But since Petri nets model concurrency and synchronization, perhaps the model needs to have a way to choose between AP and not. However, since the problem states that the approval is required only when the amount surpasses a threshold, perhaps in the Petri net, there's a choice after CA: either go to AP or directly to P. But how to model that?

Alternatively, maybe CA leads to a place that then has two outgoing transitions: one for AP (if needed) and one for P. But in Petri net, transitions are atomic. So perhaps after CA, there's a place that allows choosing between two paths. But how?

Wait, maybe the CA transition leads to a place called "Assessment Complete", which then has two possible next steps: if the amount is over threshold, then AP must happen. Otherwise, proceed to P. But how to model that in Petri net? Because the Petri net model can't directly know if the amount is over threshold. So perhaps the model has a path that includes AP and another path that bypasses AP. But that would require some kind of choice. However, in standard Petri nets, you can have a choice by having multiple transitions from a place.

Wait, perhaps after CA, there's a place that has two outgoing transitions: one leading to AP (if needed) and another leading directly to P. But how to model the condition? Well, in Petri net modeling, sometimes you have to model the possible paths. So maybe the CA transition leads to a place that then has two possible transitions: AP and P. But that's not correct. Because AP is only required if the amount is high. So perhaps the model should have two paths: one where CA leads to AP, and another where CA leads to P. But how to represent that in a Petri net.

Alternatively, maybe after CA, there's a place that represents "need approval" or "no need approval". But since the model is static, perhaps the Petri net includes both possibilities. But that might complicate things. However, in practice, for such processes, the Petri net would have a choice after CA. So the transition CA would lead to a place, which then has two outgoing transitions: one for AP and another for skipping AP. But how to model that.

Wait, perhaps the CA transition leads to a place called "CA Complete". Then from that place, there's a transition to AP (if needed) and also a transition to P. But how to model that in Petri net. Because the Petri net itself doesn't have conditions. So maybe the model would have two possible paths. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe the approval step is optional. So the process could have a path where CA leads directly to P, and another path where CA leads to AP and then to P. But how to model that.

Alternatively, perhaps the AP transition is only enabled when the amount is over threshold. But since the Petri net model is static, perhaps the model includes both possibilities. But in reality, the model would have a choice. So perhaps after CA, there's a place that has two outgoing transitions: one for AP and one for P. But that would mean that after CA, the process could either go to AP or directly to P. But in reality, it's either one or the other, not both. So the model needs to have a choice. How to model that.

In Petri nets, you can have a choice by having a place that has multiple outgoing transitions. But the choice would be made when the token is in that place, and depending on which transition fires. However, in reality, the decision is based on the amount. But since the Petri net model doesn't have conditions on transitions, perhaps the model is designed to have both paths possible. But in practice, for the purpose of this problem, maybe the approval step is part of the process, but sometimes skipped. So the model would have a transition for AP and a transition that bypasses AP. But how to model that.

Alternatively, perhaps the CA leads to a place that then has two transitions: one leading to AP and one leading to P. But that would mean that after CA, the process can either go to AP or P. But in reality, it's not both. So that's a choice. So the Petri net would have a structure where from the CA place, there's a choice between two transitions. So for example:

CA  CA Complete  [AP or P]

But how to model that. Let's say CA leads to a place "CA Complete". Then from "CA Complete", there are two transitions: one for AP (which has a condition that amount is high), and another for P (but how to model the condition). But since Petri nets don't have conditions on transitions, the model would have to have two possible paths. However, for the purpose of this problem, maybe the approval step is required for some claims and not for others. So the Petri net would have both possibilities. But how to model that.

Alternatively, perhaps the approval step is part of the process, but the model includes a loop where after CA, if the amount is high, then AP must happen. But again, the Petri net model can't know the amount. So maybe for simplicity, the problem expects that AP is a required step after CA, but that's not the case. Wait, the problem says "the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold". So sometimes AP is needed, sometimes not. So the model should have a way to choose between AP and not. So the Petri net should have two possible paths after CA: one that goes through AP and then to P, and another that goes directly to P. But how to model that.

In Petri net terms, after CA, there's a place that has two outgoing transitions. One transition is AP, leading to a place, then to P. The other transition is a direct path to P. But how to model that. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps after CA, there's a place called "CA Complete", and then from there, two transitions: one for AP (if needed) and one for skipping AP. But how to model the skipping. Alternatively, the AP transition is only enabled when the amount is high. But since the model doesn't include the amount as a variable, perhaps the model includes both possibilities. However, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the approval step is optional. So the Petri net would have a structure where after CA, there's a choice between going to AP or directly to P. But how to represent that.

In Petri nets, this is done by having a place that has multiple outgoing transitions. So for example:

CA transition leads to a place "CA Complete". Then from "CA Complete", there's a transition "AP" and a transition "Skip AP". But how to model "Skip AP" as a transition. But in reality, the "Skip AP" would not be a separate transition. Instead, perhaps the CA leads to a place that allows two paths: one where AP is done, and another where it's not. So perhaps the structure is:

CA  CA Complete  [AP or P]

But how to model that. Let's think of a place after CA. Let's say CA leads to place X. Then from X, there's a transition to AP, and a transition to P. But that would mean that after CA, the token can go to either AP or P. But in reality, it's either one or the other. So that's a choice. So that's acceptable. So in the Petri net, the place X would have two outgoing transitions: one for AP and one for P. But then, after AP, you go to P. So AP leads to a place that then goes to P. So the structure would be:

CA  X  AP  Y  P

and X  P directly. But that would mean that sometimes P happens without AP. But in reality, if AP is required, then X  AP  Y  P. If not, X  P. So yes. So in the model, X would have two outgoing transitions. But how to model that.

Alternatively, maybe the CA leads to a place that then has two transitions: one for AP and one for P. So CA  X. X has two transitions: AP and P. But then after AP, you need to go to P. So AP would lead to a place that then leads to P. But that would require that after AP, there's a transition to P. So:

CA  X

X has transition AP to Y, and transition P_direct to P. Then Y has transition to P.

But that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps after CA, there's a place that leads to a choice between AP and skipping. So the structure would be:

CA  X

X has transition AP to Y, and also X has a transition to P.

But then Y would lead to P. So the AP path is CA  X  AP  Y  P, and the other path is CA  X  P.

But that's possible. So in that case, the place X would have two outgoing transitions: one to AP, and one to P. Then AP would have a transition that leads to Y, which then leads to P. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps after CA, there's a place that allows choosing between AP and P. So X would have two transitions: AP and P. But then the AP transition would lead to a place that then leads to P. But perhaps the AP transition leads directly to P. But then, if AP is needed, it's done, then P. If not, then P directly.

Wait, but in that case, the AP transition would be part of the process. So if AP is required, then AP happens, then P. If not, then P happens directly. So the structure would be:

CA  X

X  AP  P

and X  P

But then, if X has two outgoing transitions: one to AP and one to P. But then when X has a token, either AP or P can fire. So that's a choice. So that's acceptable. But then, after AP fires, it leads to P. So the AP transition would have an arc to P. But wait, transitions connect places. So X is a place. AP is a transition. So X  AP (arc), then AP  P_place. Then P_place would have a transition to P. Wait, no. Let's think in terms of places and transitions.

Let me recall: in Petri nets, transitions are the activities, and places are the states. So when a transition fires, it consumes tokens from input places and produces tokens in output places.

So, for example, the CA transition would consume a token from a place (say, "CA in") and produce a token in "CA out". Then, from "CA out", there are two possible transitions: AP and P. But that's not correct. Because the P transition would be the payment step. So perhaps:

After CA, the token is in a place called "CA Complete". From "CA Complete", there's a transition AP that requires the token to be consumed, and then produces a token in "AP Complete". Then from "AP Complete", there's a transition to P. But also, from "CA Complete", there's a transition that directly leads to P. So "CA Complete" has two outgoing transitions: AP and P_direct. But P_direct would be a transition that leads to P. Wait, but P is the payment step. So perhaps:

CA transition  CA Complete place.

From CA Complete, transition AP (which would lead to AP Complete place), and transition Skip AP (which leads to Payment place).

But then AP transition would have to lead to a place that then goes to Payment. So:

CA  CA Complete.

CA Complete  AP (transition)  AP Complete.

AP Complete  Payment transition  Payment place.

Also, CA Complete  Skip AP transition  Payment place.

But then, the Skip AP transition would be a transition that leads to Payment. However, the problem says that AP is required only when amount is over threshold. So in the model, sometimes AP is done, sometimes not. So the Petri net would have both possibilities. But how to model that. So the Skip AP transition would be part of the model.

But in reality, the model would have two paths: one where AP is done and one where it's not. So yes.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the approval step is part of the process, but sometimes skipped. So the Petri net should include both possibilities. So after CA, there's a choice between going through AP or directly to P.

But how to model that. Let's proceed with that.

Now, for the loops:

Document Verification (DV) has a loop with Re-Document Submission (RDS). So after DV, if documents are incomplete, then RDS happens, then back to DV. So the loop would be DV  RDS  DV.

Similarly, Fraud Check (FC) has a loop with In-depth Investigation (II). So FC  II  FC. So each time II is done, it loops back to FC.

So let's outline all the steps.

Start with a new claim. Let's have a start place. Let's say "Start" place. Then CR (Claim Registration) transition. So Start  CR transition  CR Complete place.

Then CR leads to DV. So CR Complete  DV transition  DV Complete place.

From DV Complete, there's a check: if documents are complete, proceed to FC. If not, go to RDS. So DV Complete  RDS transition  RDS Complete place. Then RDS Complete  DV transition again.

So the loop between DV and RDS.

Similarly, for FC: FC transition  FC Complete place. Then from FC Complete, if no fraud detected, proceed to CA. If fraud detected, then II. So FC Complete  II transition  II Complete place. Then II Complete  FC transition again. So loop between FC and II.

So the structure would be:

DV Complete  FC transition.

FC Complete  CA transition.

But for the loops:

After DV, if documents are incomplete, then RDS is done. So DV Complete has two outgoing transitions: one to FC (if documents are complete), and another to RDS (if incomplete). Wait, but how to model the condition. Again, in Petri net, the model would have two transitions from DV Complete: one for proceeding to FC, and another for RDS. But how to know which one is taken. But the Petri net model would have both possibilities. So for example, DV Complete place has two outgoing transitions: one to FC transition, and another to RDS transition. So whenever the token is in DV Complete, either FC or RDS can fire. But that's not correct, because if documents are complete, you go to FC; if not, you go to RDS. So the model should have the RDS transition only when documents are incomplete. But in the Petri net model, the structure would have both transitions possible, but in reality, depending on the case. So for the model, we can have a loop where after DV, if RDS is done, then back to DV. So the structure would be:

DV transition  DV Complete place.

From DV Complete, there's a transition to FC (if documents are complete), and a transition to RDS (if incomplete). But then RDS would lead back to DV. So:

DV Complete  RDS transition  RDS Complete place.

RDS Complete  DV transition.

So the loop is DV Complete  RDS  RDS Complete  DV  DV Complete.

Similarly for FC and II.

So the structure would be:

FC transition  FC Complete.

FC Complete  CA transition (if no fraud), or FC Complete  II transition  II Complete  FC transition.

So FC Complete has two outgoing transitions: one to CA and one to II.

But again, in reality, depending on the case, but the model includes both possibilities.

Now, for the Approval step. Let's see.

After CA, there's a choice between AP and not. So CA transition  CA Complete.

CA Complete  AP transition (if needed), or CA Complete  P transition.

But AP transition leads to AP Complete, which then leads to P transition.

So:

CA Complete  AP  AP Complete  P.

CA Complete  P directly.

But P transition leads to Payment place, then to N transition.

Wait, payment is P, then notification N, then closure CL.

So after P, N, then CL.

So the main path is:

Start  CR  DV  FC  CA  AP  P  N  CL.

But with loops for RDS and II.

But also, the AP is optional.

So let's list all the places and transitions.

First, let's define all the transitions:

- CR: Claim Registration

- DV: Document Verification

- RDS: Re-Document Submission

- FC: Fraud Check

- II: In-depth Investigation

- CA: Claim Assessment

- AP: Approval

- P: Payment

- N: Notification

- CL: Closure

Now, the places.

Let's start with the initial place: "Start" place.

Then after CR, a place "CR Complete".

CR Complete  DV.

DV  "DV Complete".

From DV Complete, two transitions: one to FC (if documents are complete), and one to RDS (if incomplete).

RDS transition  "RDS Complete", which then leads back to DV.

Similarly, FC transition  "FC Complete".

From FC Complete, transitions to CA (if no fraud) or to II (if fraud detected).

II transition  "II Complete", which leads back to FC.

CA transition  "CA Complete".

From CA Complete, transitions to AP (if needed) or to P (if not).

AP transition  "AP Complete", then to P.

P transition  "Payment Done".

Payment Done  N transition  "Notification Sent".

Notification Sent  CL transition  "Closed".

But also, the CL transition would lead to the final place.

So the final marking is a token in "Closed".

Now, the initial marking has a token in "Start".

So let's outline all places:

- Start

- CR Complete

- DV Complete

- RDS Complete

- FC Complete

- II Complete

- CA Complete

- AP Complete

- Payment Done

- Notification Sent

- Closed

Also, perhaps other places for intermediate steps.

Wait, let's think step by step.

Start  CR (transition)  CR Complete place.

CR Complete  DV (transition)  DV Complete.

From DV Complete, two transitions: one to FC (so DV Complete  FC transition), and one to RDS (DV Complete  RDS transition).

RDS transition  RDS Complete place.

RDS Complete  DV transition (so RDS Complete  DV).

Wait, but DV is a transition. So RDS Complete  DV transition. So when RDS Complete has a token, DV can fire.

Similarly, FC transition  FC Complete.

FC Complete  CA transition (if no fraud), or FC Complete  II transition (if fraud).

II transition  II Complete.

II Complete  FC transition (so II Complete  FC).

CA transition  CA Complete.

CA Complete  AP transition (if needed), or CA Complete  P transition.

AP transition  AP Complete.

AP Complete  P transition.

P transition  Payment Done.

Payment Done  N transition  Notification Sent.

Notification Sent  CL transition  Closed.

So the places would be:

Start, CR Complete, DV Complete, RDS Complete, FC Complete, II Complete, CA Complete, AP Complete, Payment Done, Notification Sent, Closed.

Now, let's check the transitions:

- CR: input place Start, output CR Complete.

- DV: input CR Complete, output DV Complete.

- RDS: input DV Complete, output RDS Complete.

- FC: input DV Complete, output FC Complete. (Wait, but DV Complete has two outgoing transitions: one to FC and one to RDS. So yes.)

Wait, no. The DV Complete place has two outgoing transitions: RDS and FC. So when a token is in DV Complete, either RDS or FC can fire.

But FC transition would consume from DV Complete and produce FC Complete.

Similarly, RDS transition consumes DV Complete and produces RDS Complete.

Then RDS Complete  DV transition. So DV transition consumes RDS Complete and produces DV Complete.

Similarly for FC and II.

So FC transition consumes DV Complete and produces FC Complete.

FC Complete has two outgoing transitions: CA and II.

So FC Complete  CA transition, and FC Complete  II transition.

II transition consumes FC Complete and produces II Complete.

II Complete  FC transition. So FC transition consumes II Complete and produces FC Complete.

CA transition consumes FC Complete (if FC Complete is the input) and produces CA Complete.

Wait, no. CA transition would have input from FC Complete. Because FC Complete is the place where FC has finished. So FC transition's output is FC Complete. Then from FC Complete, CA transition would consume FC Complete and produce CA Complete.

Yes.

Similarly, CA transition consumes FC Complete and produces CA Complete.

Then CA Complete has two outgoing transitions: AP and P.

AP transition consumes CA Complete and produces AP Complete.

AP Complete  P transition.

P transition consumes AP Complete (or CA Complete directly, if the path is CA Complete  P).

Wait, if CA Complete has a direct transition to P, then P transition would consume CA Complete.

So:

CA Complete  P transition  Payment Done.

And CA Complete  AP transition  AP Complete  P transition.

So P transition would have two possible input places: CA Complete (if skipping AP) and AP Complete (if AP was done).

So P transition's input places are CA Complete and AP Complete.

Wait, no. Because when AP is done, AP Complete is produced, then P transition would consume AP Complete. And when AP is skipped, CA Complete is consumed by P transition.

So yes.

So P transition has two input places: CA Complete and AP Complete.

But that's not possible. Because in Petri nets, a transition can have multiple input places. So P transition would consume tokens from either CA Complete or AP Complete.

But that would mean that when P transition fires, it takes a token from one of those places. But in reality, the path is either CA  P directly or CA  AP  P. So the input to P transition would be CA Complete (if skipping AP) or AP Complete (if AP was done).

So yes. So P transition has two input places: CA Complete and AP Complete.

Similarly, after P transition, it produces a token in Payment Done.

Then Payment Done  N transition  Notification Sent.

N transition consumes Payment Done, produces Notification Sent.

Notification Sent  CL transition  Closed.

CL transition consumes Notification Sent, produces Closed.

So the final marking has a token in Closed.

Now, the initial marking has a token in Start.

So the steps for the code:

We need to create a Petri net with all these places and transitions, then connect them with arcs.

Let's list all the places and transitions.

Places:

- start_place

- cr_complete

- dv_complete

- rds_complete

- fc_complete

- ii_complete

- ca_complete

- ap_complete

- payment_done

- notification_sent

- closed

Transitions:

- cr

- dv

- rds

- fc

- ii

- ca

- ap

- p

- n

- cl

Now, let's define the arcs.

Start place  cr transition.

cr transition  cr_complete.

cr_complete  dv transition.

dv transition  dv_complete.

dv_complete  rds transition.

rds transition  rds_complete.

rds_complete  dv transition.

dv_complete  fc transition.

fc transition  fc_complete.

fc_complete  ca transition.

fc_complete  ii transition.

ii transition  ii_complete.

ii_complete  fc transition.

ca transition  ca_complete.

ca_complete  ap transition.

ca_complete  p transition.

ap transition  ap_complete.

ap_complete  p transition.

p transition  payment_done.

payment_done  n transition.

n transition  notification_sent.

notification_sent  cl transition.

cl transition  closed.

Wait, but let's check.

For example:

dv_complete has two outgoing transitions: rds and fc.

So dv_complete  rds transition (arc), and dv_complete  fc transition (arc).

Similarly, rds transition's output is rds_complete.

rds_complete  dv transition (arc).

Similarly, fc_complete has two outgoing transitions: ca and ii.

So fc_complete  ca transition and fc_complete  ii transition.

ii transition's output is ii_complete.

ii_complete  fc transition (arc).

ca transition's input is fc_complete. So fc_complete  ca transition.

ca transition's output is ca_complete.

ca_complete  ap transition and ca_complete  p transition.

ap transition's output is ap_complete.

ap_complete  p transition.

p transition's inputs are ca_complete and ap_complete.

Wait, no. Because p transition consumes tokens from either ca_complete or ap_complete. So the arcs would be:

ca_complete  p transition (arc)

ap_complete  p transition (arc)

Yes.

Then p transition  payment_done.

payment_done  n transition.

n transition  notification_sent.

notification_sent  cl transition.

cl transition  closed.

Yes.

Now, let's check the initial marking: im = {start_place: 1}

Final marking: fm = {closed: 1}

So when the process completes, there's a token in closed.

Now, the code.

We need to create a PetriNet object, add all places and transitions.

Then add arcs between them.

Let's see.

First, create the PetriNet.

Then add places:

start_place = PetriNet.Place('start')

cr_complete = PetriNet.Place('cr_complete')

dv_complete = PetriNet.Place('dv_complete')

rds_complete = PetriNet.Place('rds_complete')

fc_complete = PetriNet.Place('fc_complete')

ii_complete = PetriNet.Place('ii_complete')

ca_complete = PetriNet.Place('ca_complete')

ap_complete = PetriNet.Place('ap_complete')

payment_done = PetriNet.Place('payment_done')

notification_sent = PetriNet.Place('notification_sent')

closed = PetriNet.Place('closed')

Transitions:

cr = PetriNet.Transition('cr', 'Claim Registration')

dv = PetriNet.Transition('dv', 'Document Verification')

rds = PetriNet.Transition('rds', 'Re-Document Submission')

fc = PetriNet.Transition('fc', 'Fraud Check')

ii = PetriNet.Transition('ii', 'In-depth Investigation')

ca = PetriNet.Transition('ca', 'Claim Assessment')

ap = PetriNet.Transition('ap', 'Approval')

p = PetriNet.Transition('p', 'Payment')

n = PetriNet.Transition('n', 'Notification')

cl = PetriNet.Transition('cl', 'Closure')

Then add all places to the net.

Add all transitions to the net.

Then add arcs.

For example:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start_place, cr, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr, cr_complete, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr_complete, dv, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, dv_complete, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv_complete, rds, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds, rds_complete, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds_complete, dv, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv_complete, fc, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc, fc_complete, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_complete, ca, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_complete, ii, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii, ii_complete, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii_complete, fc, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca, ca_complete, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca_complete, ap, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca_complete, p, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap, ap_complete, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap_complete, p, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p, payment_done, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment_done, n, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n, notification_sent, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notification_sent, cl, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cl, closed, net)

Wait, but for the p transition: it has two input places: ca_complete and ap_complete. So the arcs for p would be:

ca_complete  p transition (arc)

ap_complete  p transition (arc)

Then p transition  payment_done.

Yes.

Similarly, the other arcs.

Now, the initial marking im is {start_place: 1}

Final marking fm is {closed: 1}

So the code would create all these places and transitions, add arcs as per above.

Now, let's check if there are any missing arcs.

For example, after cr transition, it goes to cr_complete.

cr_complete  dv transition.

Yes.

dv transition  dv_complete.

Yes.

dv_complete  rds and fc.

Yes.

rds  rds_complete.

rds_complete  dv.

Yes.

fc  fc_complete.

fc_complete  ca and ii.

ii  ii_complete.

ii_complete  fc.

Yes.

ca  ca_complete.

ca_complete  ap and p.

ap  ap_complete.

ap_complete  p.

p  payment_done.

payment_done  n.

n  notification_sent.

notification_sent  cl.

cl  closed.

Yes.

Now, let's check for any possible errors.

For example, the transition 'p' has two input places: ca_complete and ap_complete. So when the p transition fires, it consumes a token from either ca_complete or ap_complete. So yes.

But the p transition's output is payment_done. So after p fires, payment_done has a token.

Yes.

Similarly, the cl transition consumes notification_sent and produces closed.

Yes.

So the code should have all these arcs.

Now, the initial marking: im has start_place with 1 token.

Final marking: fm has closed with 1 token.

So the code would look like:

Create the net.

Add all places and transitions.

Add arcs.

Then create im and fm.

Now, in the example given in the prompt, they removed the sink place. But in our case, the closed place is the final place, so we don't remove it. The final marking has closed.

So the code should not remove any places.

So the code would be:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet("insurance_claim_net")

# Create places
start_place = PetriNet.Place("start")
cr_complete = PetriNet.Place("cr_complete")
dv_complete = PetriNet.Place("dv_complete")
rds_complete = PetriNet.Place("rds_complete")
fc_complete = PetriNet.Place("fc_complete")
ii_complete = PetriNet.Place("ii_complete")
ca_complete = PetriNet.Place("ca_complete")
ap_complete = PetriNet.Place("ap_complete")
payment_done = PetriNet.Place("payment_done")
notification_sent = PetriNet.Place("notification_sent")
closed = PetriNet.Place("closed")

# Create transitions
cr = PetriNet.Transition("cr", "Claim Registration")
dv = PetriNet.Transition("dv", "Document Verification")
rds = PetriNet.Transition("rds", "Re-Document Submission")
fc = PetriNet.Transition("fc", "Fraud Check")
ii = PetriNet.Transition("ii", "In-depth Investigation")
ca = PetriNet.Transition("ca", "Claim Assessment")
ap = PetriNet.Transition("ap", "Approval")
p = PetriNet.Transition("p", "Payment")
n = PetriNet.Transition("n", "Notification")
cl = PetriNet.Transition("cl", "Closure")

# Add all places to the net
net.places.add(start_place)
net.places.add(cr_complete)
net.places.add(dv_complete)
net.places.add(rds_complete)
net.places.add(fc_complete)
net.places.add(ii_complete)
net.places.add(ca_complete)
net.places.add(ap_complete)
net.places.add(payment_done)
net.places.add(notification_sent)
net.places.add(closed)

# Add all transitions to the net
net.transitions.add(cr)
net.transitions.add(dv)
net.transitions.add(rds)
net.transitions.add(fc)
net.transitions.add(ii)
net.transitions.add(ca)
net.transitions.add(ap)
net.transitions.add(p)
net.transitions.add(n)
net.transitions.add(cl)

# Add arcs
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start_place, cr, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr, cr_complete, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr_complete, dv, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, dv_complete, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv_complete, rds, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds, rds_complete, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds_complete, dv, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv_complete, fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc, fc_complete, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_complete, ca, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_complete, ii, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii, ii_complete, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii_complete, fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca, ca_complete, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca_complete, ap, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca_complete, p, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap, ap_complete, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap_complete, p, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p, payment_done, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment_done, n, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n, notification_sent, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notification_sent, cl, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cl, closed, net)

# Initial marking: token in start_place
im = Marking()
im[start_place] = 1

# Final marking: token in closed
fm = Marking()
fm[closed] = 1

Wait, but in the example code from the prompt, they removed the sink place. But in our case, the closed place is part of the net, so we don't remove it. So the code should be correct.

Let me check if all arcs are correctly added.

For example, after ca_complete, there are two arcs: to ap and to p. Yes.

ap transition has arc from ca_complete to ap, then ap to ap_complete.

ap_complete to p.

p transition has input from ca_complete (arc from ca_complete to p) and ap_complete (arc from ap_complete to p).

Yes.

Yes.

So the code seems correct.

Wait, the transition 'p' has two input places: ca_complete and ap_complete. So the arcs are:

ca_complete  p transition (yes, petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca_complete, p, net))

ap_complete  p transition (yes)

Yes.

Similarly, for the other arcs.

Another check: for the loop between RDS and DV.

rds_complete  dv transition. So when rds_complete has a token, dv can fire.

Yes.

Similarly, dv transition  dv_complete.

Yes.

And dv_complete has arcs to rds and fc.

Yes.

For FC and II loop: ii_complete  fc transition.

Yes.

fc transition  fc_complete.

Yes.

fc_complete has arcs to ca and ii.

Yes.

So the code should be correct.

Now, in the code, when adding arcs, the order of arguments is from_place, to_transition, net for the first arc.

Wait, the petri_utils.add_arc_from_to function takes source, target, net.

If source is a place and target is a transition, then it's an arc from place to transition.

If source is a transition and target is a place, then arc from transition to place.

Yes.

So for example:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start_place, cr, net)  arc from start_place (place) to cr (transition)

Then petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr, cr_complete, net)  arc from cr (transition) to cr_complete (place)

Yes.

Yes.

So all the arcs are correctly added.

So the code should be as above.

Now, let's check if there's any missing arcs.

For example, after cl transition, it should produce closed. So cl transition  closed.

Yes: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cl, closed, net)

Yes.

Similarly, notification_sent  cl transition. So petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notification_sent, cl, net)

Yes.

Yes.

So the code seems correct.

Now, what about the transitions' labels? The transitions have labels like "Claim Registration", etc. Which is correct.

The initial marking has start_place with 1 token. Final marking has closed with 1 token.

Yes.

So the code should be correct.

Now, let's check if any places or transitions are missing.

All steps are included.

So I think this is correct.
