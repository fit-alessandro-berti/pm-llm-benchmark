Here is the list of tasks from the BPMN 2.0 XML:

1. `decide`
2. `pay compensation`
3. `check ticket`
4. `examine casually`
5. `register request`
6. `reject request`
7. `examine thoroughly`
8. `reinitiate request`

Note that there are also several flow elements that trigger the execution of tasks, such as `startEvent`, `exclusiveGateway`, `parallelGateway`, and `sequenceFlow`. However, the above list only includes the tasks that are explicitly specified as part of the task definitions.
