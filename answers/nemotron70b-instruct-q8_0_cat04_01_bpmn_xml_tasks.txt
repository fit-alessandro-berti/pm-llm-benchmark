Based on the provided BPMN 2.0 XML, I'll extract the task elements for you. Please note that I'm assuming that by "tasks," you're referring to both **Tasks** and potentially other activity types like **Sub-Processes**, as the distinction isn't always clear without more context. However, since the question specifically mentions "tasks," I will focus on elements typically categorized under tasks:

### Task Elements Typically Identified in BPMN 2.0:
- **Task**: General task for a single piece of work.
- Other activity types might include (but are not strictly 'tasks'):
  - **SubProcess**: A set of activities, possibly with its own process flow.

### Extracted from the Provided XML:

1. **idffd64fe5-2f7f-4ab0-b08d-121be76f6dd8** - No element definition is provided in the snippet for this ID. Assume it's a task or an activity based on sequence flow references.
   
2. **ide78b8ded-70fd-43fc-9699-acee5a4f095a** - Similarly, no explicit type mentioned in the provided snippet.

3. **id1c963927-0fbe-4028-9d31-536a6e5362a9**

4. **idb86a1356-bb12-4a45-b1a3-d430cf587b6b** - Same as above; no explicit type in the snippet.

5. **id3152b404-1b39-4c61-bff7-1e4e507f627a**

6. **id25fcead3-d54b-47a1-b9dc-5ac5df8a31db**

7. **idd371ddf5-0e93-4afa-bd26-49c2c4bc293e** (Referenced in a sequence flow, implying it's an activity/task)

8. **idc5b9256f-0a5c-43f7-9877-8a7d17977ee2**

9. **id34fba6ea-bbb7-47b7-94a8-3417ede3ceef**

10. **idd3814e0c-ae8b-41d6-b7a1-7c0e9385eb3e** (Similarly, implied to be an activity/task)

11. **idfe1bd2a5-fb67-4a1a-b520-d7d02ee587e7**

12. **id12442c46-240c-4ef8-b16c-249cb1e050b6** (Implied activity/task due to sequence flow involvement)

13. **id3fe498e9-097b-4628-96b0-639beba726c7** (Again, implied by its connection in the sequence flows)

### Observations:
- The IDs listed above are implicated as tasks or activities because they are either sources or targets of `<bpmn:sequenceFlow>` elements, which typically connect activities in a process model.
- The exact nature (e.g., **Task**, **SubProcess**, etc.) for each ID cannot be determined without the full element definitions, especially those within `<bpmn:process>` but outside the provided `<bpmn:sequenceFlow>` context.

To accurately categorize these elements as specific task types (e.g., User Task, Service Task, Script Task), you would need to examine their respective element definitions in the BPMN XML, looking for tags like `<bpmn:Task>`, `<bpmn:UserTask>`, `<bpmn:ServiceTask>`, etc.
