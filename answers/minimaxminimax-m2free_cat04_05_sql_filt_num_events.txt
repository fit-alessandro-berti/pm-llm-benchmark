We are given a table `event_log` with columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`.
 We want to return only the events from cases that have 6 or fewer events in total.

 Approach:
 1. We can first compute the event count per `case_id` and then filter the `case_id`s that have count <= 6.
 2. We can do this in a few ways. One common way is to use a subquery or a CTE (Common Table Expression).

 Steps:
 - Create a subquery (or CTE) that groups by `case_id` and counts the number of events per `case_id`.
 - Then, in the main query, select from `event_log` only the rows where `case_id` is in the set of `case_id`s that have count <= 6.

 Alternatively, we can use a window function to count events per case and then filter on that count without a separate subquery, but note that the requirement is to exclude entire cases.

 However, note: using a window function in the same table would require a subquery because we cannot directly use the window function result in a WHERE clause of the same level.

 Let's write it with a CTE for clarity:

 Example:
   WITH case_counts AS (
      SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as event_count
      FROM event_log
      GROUP BY case_id
   )
   SELECT el.*
   FROM event_log el
   JOIN case_counts cc ON el.case_id = cc.case_id
   WHERE cc.event_count <= 6;

 But note: what if a case has exactly 6 events? We include it. We exclude only if the count is > 6.

 Alternatively, we can use a subquery in the WHERE clause:

   SELECT *
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (
      SELECT case_id
      FROM event_log
      GROUP BY case_id
      HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
   );

 Both methods are valid. The second one (using IN) might be less efficient on very large tables because of the subquery, but for the purpose of this benchmark, it's acceptable.

 However, note that the table might have duplicate rows? But the problem doesn't specify, and we are grouping by `case_id` and counting events. The table structure suggests that each row is an event, so the count of rows per `case_id` is the event count.

 Let's go with the second approach because it's straightforward and uses a single table reference for the main query.

 But note: if there are a lot of `case_id`s with events <=6, the IN clause might become very large. Alternatively, we can use EXISTS with a correlated subquery, but that might also be heavy.

 Another option is to use a window function and then filter on that in a derived table:

   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
   FROM (
      SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) as event_count
      FROM event_log
   ) t
   WHERE event_count <= 6;

 This method uses a window function and then filters. It avoids the potential performance issue of the IN clause with a large list.

 However, note that the window function will compute the count for every row, which might be efficient if the table is not too large, but for very large datasets, it might be more expensive than the grouping method (which groups once) if there are many cases.

 But the requirement is to return the events for the cases that have <=6 events. The window function method is straightforward and avoids the need for a join or subquery in the FROM clause.

 Since the problem does not specify the size, I'll choose the window function method as it is concise and does not require a separate grouping subquery.

 Let me write the query using the window function:

   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
   FROM (
      SELECT 
         case_id,
         activity,
         timestamp,
         COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count
      FROM event_log
   ) subquery
   WHERE event_count <= 6;

 This will return all events for cases that have 6 or fewer events.

 However, note: if there are many cases with exactly 6 events, this method will compute the window function for every row and then filter, but it's efficient because the partition is by `case_id` and the count is computed per partition.

 Alternatively, we can also use:

   SELECT el.*
   FROM event_log el
   WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log el2 WHERE el2.case_id = el.case_id) <= 6;

 But this is a correlated subquery and might be slow for large tables because it runs the subquery for every row.

 So, between the window function and the grouping with IN, the window function method is likely more efficient for large tables because it computes the counts in one pass.

 Therefore, I'll use the window function method.

 Let's write the final query.

To solve this problem, we need to filter events from a DuckDB table such that only events belonging to cases with six or fewer events are returned. The solution involves identifying cases with more than six events and excluding all their events from the result set.

### Approach
1. **Identify Cases with More Than Six Events**: First, we compute the count of events per `case_id` to identify which cases exceed the threshold of six events.
2. **Filter Events from Valid Cases**: Next, we filter the original event log to include only events from cases that have six or fewer events. This is achieved by joining the event log with the list of valid `case_id`s (those with six or fewer events) and then selecting events where the `case_id` is in this valid set.

### Solution Code
```sql
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) valid_cases ON el.case_id = valid_cases.case_id;
```

### Explanation
1. **Subquery for Valid Cases**: The subquery `SELECT case_id ... GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` identifies all `case_id` values where the number of events (counted using `COUNT(*)`) is six or fewer. This is done by grouping the events by `case_id` and applying the `HAVING` clause to filter groups based on the event count.
2. **Join with Event Log**: The main query joins the original `event_log` table (`el`) with the subquery result (`valid_cases`) on `case_id`. This ensures that only events from valid cases (those with six or fewer events) are included in the result.
3. **Result Selection**: The `SELECT el.*` statement retrieves all columns from the filtered events, ensuring the output includes all relevant details from the original event log.

This approach efficiently processes the data in two logical steps: first identifying valid cases via aggregation, and then filtering the event log based on these cases, ensuring optimal performance and clarity.
