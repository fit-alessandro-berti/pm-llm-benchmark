The diagram consists of three main parts: a process flow for two proctlet classes connected through channels, a class diagram, and an example of a performative. In the process flow (a), two proctlets, "Lab visit" and 'Lab test,' interact through channels labeled 'Order system' and 'HIS.' The 'Lab visit' proctlet involves steps like ordering entry, taking a blood sample, and receiving results, while the 'Lab test' proctlet includes performing tests, making reports, and providing updated reports. The class diagram (b) shows a relationship where a 'Lab visit' requires one or more 'Lab tests,' indicating a one-to-many association. The table (c) provides an example of a performative message at 11:00, detailing the sender (Lab visit - John), receiver (Lab test - HGB - John), action (create), content (request for HGB test), scope (private), and direction (out). The overall concept illustrates the interaction and communication between lab visit and lab test processes, emphasizing the structured flow and messaging involved in managing lab tests and results.
