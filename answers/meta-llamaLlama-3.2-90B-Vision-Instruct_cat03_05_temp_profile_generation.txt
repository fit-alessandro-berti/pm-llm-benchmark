Based on a real-world perspective, here is an estimated temporal profile dictionary:
```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 43200),  # 1 day avg, 0.5 day stdev
    ('OP', 'RC'): (172800, 86400),  # 2 days avg, 1 day stdev
    ('RC', 'QI'): (21600, 10800),  # 6 hours avg, 3 hours stdev
    ('QI', 'CA'): (28800, 14400),  # 8 hours avg, 4 hours stdev
    ('CA', 'PT'): (43200, 21600),  # 12 hours avg, 6 hours stdev
    ('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 7200),  # 4 hours avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('PK', 'WS'): (21600, 10800),  # 6 hours avg, 3 hours stdev
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 43200),  # 1 day avg, 0.5 day stdev
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 259200),  # 7 days avg, 3 days stdev
    ('SS', 'DT'): (1209600, 518400),  # 14 days avg, 6 days stdev
    ('OP', 'PT'): (345600, 172800),  # 4 days avg, 2 days stdev
    ('QI', 'WS'): (259200, 129600),  # 3 days avg, 1.5 days stdev
    ('CA', 'AS'): (604800, 259200),  # 7 days avg, 3 days stdev
}
```
This estimated temporal profile includes a representative subset of activity pairs in the global supply chain process. The times are rough estimates based on real-world experience, considering factors like supplier lead times, manufacturing complexity, testing thoroughness, packaging speed, and distribution network efficiency.

Here's a brief explanation for each pair:

* `('SS', 'OP')`: Supplier selection typically takes around 1 day, with a standard deviation of 0.5 days.
* `('OP', 'RC')`: Order placement to receiving components usually takes around 2 days, with a standard deviation of 1 day.
* `('RC', 'QI')`: Receiving components to quality inspection typically takes around 6 hours, with a standard deviation of 3 hours.
* `('QI', 'CA')`: Quality inspection to component assembly usually takes around 8 hours, with a standard deviation of 4 hours.
* `('CA', 'PT')`: Component assembly to product testing typically takes around 12 hours, with a standard deviation of 6 hours.
* `('PT', 'PK')`: Product testing to packaging usually takes around 4 hours, with a standard deviation of 2 hours.
* `('PK', 'WS')`: Packaging to warehouse storage typically takes around 6 hours, with a standard deviation of 3 hours.
* `('WS', 'DT')`: Warehouse storage to distribution usually takes around 1 day, with a standard deviation of 0.5 days.
* `('DT', 'AS')`: Distribution to after-sales support typically takes around 7 days, with a standard deviation of 3 days.
* `('SS', 'DT')`: Supplier selection to distribution usually takes around 14 days, with a standard deviation of 6 days (this pair is separated by multiple steps).
* `('OP', 'PT')`: Order placement to product testing typically takes around 4 days, with a standard deviation of 2 days (this pair is separated by multiple steps).
* `('QI', 'WS')`: Quality inspection to warehouse storage usually takes around 3 days, with a standard deviation of 1.5 days (this pair is separated by multiple steps).
* `('CA', 'AS')`: Component assembly to after-sales support typically takes around 7 days, with a standard deviation of 3 days (this pair is separated by multiple steps).

Note that these estimates are rough and may vary depending on the specific industry, company, and process implementation.
