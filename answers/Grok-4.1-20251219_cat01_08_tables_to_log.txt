Here is the comprehensive event log for process mining, derived from the provided tables.

**Case ID** uses `order_id`.  
Events are sorted chronologically per case.  
Activities include:
- "Order Created" (from Orders table, resource: sales person)
- "Item Picked" (one event per order line, resource: picker)
- "Shipment Dispatched" (one per delivery record, resource: carrier)
- "Shipment Arrived" (one per delivery record, resource: carrier)
- "Invoice Issued" (one per invoice, resource: billing clerk)
- "Payment Received" (one per payment, resource: "Customer" as no specific actor is recorded)

Note: Order 1004 has only "Order Created" and "Item Picked" events, as no delivery, invoice, or payment records exist for it (assumed incomplete or ongoing process).
