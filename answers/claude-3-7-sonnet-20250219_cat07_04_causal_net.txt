The image shows a workflow diagram that illustrates a business process model. 

The main diagram depicts a request handling process with several connected nodes:
- Node 'a' labeled "register request" is the starting point
- From there, the process can flow to different examination steps:
  - Node 'b' labeled "examine thoroughly"
  - Node 'c' labeled "examine casually"
  - Node 'd' labeled "check ticket"
- Node 'f' labeled "reinitiate request" can be reached from various points in the process
- Node 'e' labeled "decide" appears to be a decision point
- After the decision, the process can either go to:
  - Node 'g' labeled "pay compensation"
  - Node 'h' labeled "reject request"
- Node 'z' labeled "end" represents the conclusion of the process

In the bottom right corner, there's a gray box showing different types of workflow pattern operators:
- XOR-split and XOR-join
- AND-split and AND-join
- OR-split and OR-join

These operators represent different ways that process flows can branch out or converge. The diagram appears to be using standard business process modeling notation, likely for explaining workflow concepts or documenting a specific business procedure.
