Based on the normative process description and the event log, here is the analysis of deviations:

**Cases Violating the Normative Process:**

Cases 2, 3, and 5 violate the normative process.

**Explanation of Violations:**

* **Case 1: Conforming Case**
    * **Process Flow:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order
    * **Conformance:** This case perfectly aligns with the described flow for a scenario where inventory is sufficient. The order of activities follows the sequence specified: Receive is first, Check inventory is before payment authorization, payment authorization is before packaging, packaging is before shipping, and Close order is the final activity.

* **Case 2: Violating Case**
    * **Process Flow:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
    * **Violation:** This case violates the rule that "Authorize payment" should only occur *after* "Check inventory" and *before* packaging. In Case 2, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment". The normative description explicitly states, "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known." By packaging before authorizing payment, the process is proceeding with a fulfillment step before confirming that the payment method is valid and approved, which is a deviation from the intended logic.

* **Case 3: Violating Case**
    * **Process Flow:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order
    * **Violations:** This case has multiple violations:
        * **Violation 1 (Authorization followed by Cancellation and Shipping):** The process includes "Authorize payment", which implies that inventory was sufficient or assumed to be sufficient. However, it then proceeds to "Cancel order". This is a deviation because the cancellation path is intended for insufficient inventory scenarios, and in such cases, fulfillment activities (like shipping) are illogical.
        * **Violation 2 (Shipping after Cancellation):** The most significant violation is the presence of "Ship order" after "Cancel order". The normative description clearly states, "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)," and explicitly, "Ship order should... never after a cancellation." This is a direct and explicit violation.

* **Case 4: Conforming Case**
    * **Process Flow:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order
    * **Conformance:** This case aligns with the described flow for a scenario where inventory is insufficient. The sequence follows the pattern outlined: Receive is first, Check inventory is before cancellation, and Cancel is followed by Close order as the final activity. Fulfillment activities are correctly omitted.

* **Case 5: Violating Case**
    * **Process Flow:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
    * **Violation:** This case violates the rule that "Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping. The sequence includes "Authorize payment" and "Ship order", but "Package items" is entirely missing between them. The normative description states, "'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped." Skipping the packaging step before shipping constitutes a deviation from the expected preparation process.

In summary, Cases 2, 3, and 5 deviate from the normative process by either performing activities in an incorrect order (Case 2), proceeding with fulfillment activities after a cancellation (Case 3), or skipping required steps in the fulfillment path (Case 5). Case 3 also exhibits a logical inconsistency by authorizing payment and then canceling, although the most direct violation is the subsequent shipping.
