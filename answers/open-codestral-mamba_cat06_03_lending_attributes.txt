Sensitive attributes for fairness analysis are typically those that, if they are not evenly distributed among the different groups being compared (in this case, various attributes of the borrowers), could lead to unfair outcomes. In this case, some potential sensitive attributes could be:

1. `case:citizen`: If there are significant differences in outcomes based on whether the borrower is a citizen or not.

2. `case:gender`: If there are differences in outcomes based on the gender of the borrower.

3. `case:german speaking`: If there are differences in outcomes based on whether the borrower speaks German or not.

4. `resource`: If the outcomes differ based on the resource (e.g., the loan officer) handling the case.

5. `concept:name`: If there are differences in outcomes based on the activity or process being performed.

To ensure fairness, it would be important to ensure that these attributes are evenly distributed among the groups being compared, and that any differences in outcomes are not due to these attributes. This could involve adjusting the process or resource allocation to ensure that these attributes are more evenly distributed.
