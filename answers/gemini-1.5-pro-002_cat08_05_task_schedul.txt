## Optimizing Job Shop Scheduling at Precision Parts Inc. using Process Mining

This document outlines a data-driven approach using process mining to analyze and improve the task scheduling strategies at Precision Parts Inc.

**1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics:**

Process mining will be used to reconstruct the "as-is" job flow and task execution using the MES event logs. The following techniques and metrics are crucial:

* **Process Discovery:** Algorithms like Alpha Miner or Heuristic Miner will create a process model visualizing the actual job routing and task sequences, revealing deviations from the planned process.
* **Conformance Checking:**  This will highlight deviations from the planned process, revealing rework loops, skipped tasks, or alternative routings.
* **Performance Analysis:**  This will quantify key metrics:
    * **Job Flow Time/Lead Time/Makespan:** Measured from job release to completion, using timestamps in the log. Distribution analysis will reveal variability and outliers.
    * **Task Waiting Times:** Time between "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" events for each task and work center.
    * **Resource Utilization:** Calculated from "Task Start" and "Task End" timestamps for machines and operators.  Breakdown time can be derived from "Breakdown Start" and "Breakdown End" events.
    * **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** Analyze the time difference between "Task End" of a job and "Setup Start" of the next job on the same machine.  Group setup times based on the sequence of job types (e.g., Job A followed by Job B).
    * **Schedule Adherence/Tardiness:** Compare actual job completion times with "Order Due Date" to calculate tardiness.  Visualizations like Gantt charts can illustrate adherence.
    * **Impact of Disruptions:** Analyze job flow times and waiting times before and after breakdown or priority change events.  Visualizations can highlight cascading effects.

**2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies:**

Based on the performance analysis, we can identify potential scheduling pathologies:

* **Bottleneck Analysis:** Identify resources with consistently high utilization and long queues.  Process mining can pinpoint these bottlenecks and quantify their impact on overall throughput.
* **Prioritization Issues:** Analyze flow times and waiting times for jobs with different priorities.  If high-priority jobs experience excessive delays, the prioritization logic is flawed.
* **Suboptimal Sequencing:** Compare setup times for different job sequences on the same machine. High variability suggests opportunities for optimization. Variant analysis can compare the flow of on-time vs. late jobs, revealing sequence patterns associated with delays.
* **Resource Starvation:** If a downstream resource has low utilization while its upstream resource has long queues, it indicates starvation due to upstream scheduling or bottlenecks.
* **WIP Fluctuations:** Analyze WIP levels over time. High variability suggests a bullwhip effect caused by inconsistent scheduling decisions.

**3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness:**

Process mining can help differentiate scheduling issues from resource constraints or process variability:

* **Static Dispatching Rules:**  If bottlenecks and delays occur even with sufficient capacity, the static rules are likely inadequate for a dynamic environment.
* **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** If queues form while other machines are idle, it points to a lack of real-time information for dispatching decisions.
* **Inaccurate Estimations:** Compare planned vs. actual task durations and setup times. Significant discrepancies indicate inaccurate estimations.
* **Ineffective Setup Handling:** High setup times and variability suggest a need for better sequencing strategies.
* **Poor Coordination:** Starvation and WIP fluctuations suggest lack of coordination between work centers.
* **Inadequate Disruption Handling:** If disruptions cause significant cascading delays, the current approach lacks robustness.

**4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies:**

* **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules:** Implement dynamic rules considering:
    * **Shortest Processing Time (SPT) with Setup Consideration:** Prioritize jobs with shorter processing times, factoring in the estimated sequence-dependent setup time based on the previous job on the machine (mined from the logs).
    * **Earliest Due Date (EDD) with Slack:** Consider both due date and slack time (time remaining until due date minus remaining processing time).
    * **Critical Ratio (CR):**  Prioritize jobs with the lowest CR (time remaining until due date / remaining processing time).
    * **Weighted Scoring:** Combine multiple factors with weights learned from process mining insights (e.g., higher weight for setup time at bottleneck machines).

* **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling:**
    * **Task Duration Prediction:** Use historical task duration distributions (from logs) to generate probabilistic task duration estimates. Consider factors like operator ID, job complexity, or machine condition.
    * **Predictive Bottleneck Detection:** Forecast future resource utilization based on the predicted task durations and current queue lengths. Proactively adjust schedules to avoid bottlenecks.
    * **Predictive Maintenance Integration:** Incorporate predictive maintenance data (if available) to anticipate machine breakdowns and proactively reschedule affected jobs.

* **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization:**
    * **Job Batching:** Group similar jobs requiring similar setups to minimize setup frequency. Use process mining to identify job families based on setup requirements.
    * **Setup Time Prediction:** Predict setup times based on the sequence of jobs.
    * **Optimized Sequencing at Bottlenecks:** Use genetic algorithms or other optimization techniques to determine the optimal job sequence at bottleneck machines, minimizing total setup time while considering due dates and priorities.

**5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement:**

* **Discrete-Event Simulation:**  Simulate the job shop with different scheduling strategies, parameterized with data from process mining (task times, routings, breakdowns, setups). Test scenarios like high load, frequent disruptions, and urgent job arrivals. Compare KPIs (tardiness, WIP, lead time, utilization) for each strategy.
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the chosen strategy's performance using real-time process mining. Track KPIs and detect deviations from expected behavior.
* **Adaptive Scheduling:**  Implement feedback loops.  If KPIs drift or new inefficiencies emerge, retrain predictive models and adjust scheduling parameters automatically or trigger alerts for manual intervention.

This data-driven approach, combining process mining, advanced scheduling strategies, and simulation, will enable Precision Parts Inc. to significantly improve its scheduling performance, reduce tardiness, lower WIP, achieve predictable lead times, and improve resource utilization.  The continuous improvement framework ensures long-term adaptability and robustness.
