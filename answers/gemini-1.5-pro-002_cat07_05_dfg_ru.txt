The visualization depicts a process model, likely representing a workflow for handling requests, perhaps customer service tickets or insurance claims.  It uses a directed graph, where the rectangular nodes represent activities and the arrows represent transitions between them. The circular node with a filled square inside represents the end state. The other circle with a filled dot represents the start state.

Here's a breakdown of the elements:

* **Activities (Rectangles):** Each rectangle contains a label indicating the action performed.  Numbers in parentheses after the label likely indicate the frequency or weight of that path being taken.  The activities are:
    * register request (6)
    * check ticket (9)
    * decide (9)
    * reject request (3)
    * pay compensation (3)
    * reinitiate request (3)
    * examine thoroughly (3)
    * examine casually (6)

* **Transitions (Arrows):** Arrows connect activities, showing the flow of the process.  The numbers next to the arrows likely represent how many times that transition occurred in the data used to create the visualization.  For example, a "2" next to an arrow leading from "check ticket" to "decide" suggests this path was taken twice as often as the path from "reinitiate request" to "decide" which has "1" next to it.

* **Start State (Circle with Dot):**  Indicates the beginning of the process.  The "6" likely refers to the number of processes started.

* **End State (Circle with Square):** Marks the completion of the process.

* **Flow:** The process starts with "register request" and proceeds to "check ticket."  From "check ticket," several paths are possible, including:
    * Directly to "decide"
    * Looping back to "check ticket" (self-loop)
    * Looping back to "register request"

After "decide," the process can branch to "reject request," "pay compensation," or "reinitiate request."  "Reinitiate request" loops back to "check ticket."  The process appears to end after "reject request" or "pay compensation," possibly also after "examine casually" or "examine thoroughly," although these last two steps are less clearly integrated in the central flow represented by "decide."

In summary, the visualization shows a process with multiple paths and loops, where the thickness of the lines and the numbers on them likely represent the frequency of each path based on some underlying data. The process appears to involve checking, deciding, and potentially rejecting, compensating, or re-initiating requests.  "Examine thoroughly" and "examine casually" seem like possible additional steps, perhaps for quality control or further investigation.
