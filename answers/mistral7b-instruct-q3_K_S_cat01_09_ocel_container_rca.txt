Based on the provided log data, it appears that the root cause of performance issues in the process is related to a high volume of events and objects being processed by the system within a limited time frame. 
For example, the "Book Vehicles" event has a frequency of 127 events per minute, while the "Load to Vehicle" event has a frequency of 122 events per minute. Similarly, the "Reschedule Container" event has a frequency of 19 events per minute, and the "Order Empty Containers" event has a frequency of 561 events per minute. 
These high frequencies of events are causing a significant amount of data to be processed within a limited time frame, leading to performance issues such as longer response times and increased processing times. Additionally, the duration of some events is also quite long, which further contributes to the overall processing time.
It may be necessary to optimize the system or processes to handle a higher volume of events and objects more efficiently, such as by implementing parallel processing or batching events together. It may also be helpful to prioritize certain events or tasks to ensure that critical tasks are completed within a reasonable time frame.
