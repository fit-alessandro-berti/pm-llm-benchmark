Below is a fully integrated, chronologically-ordered event log that links all the tables you supplied.  
Assumptions made  
• Case ID = order_id.  
• One event per order-line, per delivery milestone (dispatch/arrival), per invoice and per payment.  
• The Resource columns were enriched through the Resources table.  
• Payments are recorded with “—” in the Resource columns because payer identity is not specified in the source data.
