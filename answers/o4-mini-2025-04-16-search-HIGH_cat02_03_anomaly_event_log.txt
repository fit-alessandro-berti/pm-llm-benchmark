**Overview**  
The Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process typically follows this sequence of high-level steps:  
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order (PO)  
4. Receive Goods/Services  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO (3-way match: PO, receipt, invoice)  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case  

Deviations from this order can indicate control breakdowns, process inefficiencies, compliance risks, or potential fraud. Below, each case is analyzed against the expected P2P flow, with anomalies highlighted and explained.

All steps occur in the correct sequence with reasonable time lags (e.g., ~1 day to receive goods, ~3 days to match invoice). No anomalies detected.

## Case 1002 – Order and Approval Out of Sequence; Early Payment  

| Activity                        | Timestamp           | Anomaly                                    |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Create Purchase Requisition     | 2024-02-01 08:30    |                                            |
| Issue Purchase Order            | 2024-02-01 08:40    | **PO issued before requisition approval**  |
| Vendor Invoice Received         | 2024-02-03 07:00    |                                            |
| Release Payment                 | 2024-02-03 07:15    | **Payment released before invoice match**;<br>**before approval** |
| Approve Purchase Requisition    | 2024-02-03 08:00    | **Approval after payment**                 |
| Receive Goods                   | 2024-02-04 09:00    |                                            |
| Match Invoice to PO             | 2024-02-05 08:00    |                                            |
| Close Case                      | 2024-02-06 16:00    |                                            |

**Why This Is Problematic**  
- *Issuing a PO prior to approval* undermines authorization controls. It may lead to unbudgeted or unauthorized commitments.  
- *Releasing payment before matching the invoice to the PO and receiving goods* defeats the three-way match control, increasing risk of overpayment, duplicate payment, or paying for undelivered items.  
- *Approval after payment* violates basic segregation of duties: the approver cannot ensure the transaction’s legitimacy if it’s already finalized.

## Case 1003 – Payment Precedes Invoice and Receipt  

| Activity                       | Timestamp           | Anomaly                                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Create Purchase Requisition    | 2024-02-02 09:00    |                                           |
| Approve Purchase Requisition   | 2024-02-02 09:10    |                                           |
| Issue Purchase Order           | 2024-02-02 10:00    |                                           |
| Release Payment                | 2024-02-08 11:00    | **Payment occurs before invoice/receipt** |
| Vendor Invoice Received        | 2024-02-09 12:00    |                                           |
| Receive Goods                  | 2024-02-10 13:00    |                                           |
| Match Invoice to PO            | 2024-02-11 14:00    |                                           |
| Close Case                     | 2024-02-12 10:00    |                                           |

**Why This Is Problematic**  
- Paying on February 8 when the invoice arrives February 9 and goods on February 10 means funds leave before confirming what is owed or even delivered.  
- This breaks invoice-to-goods verification and again negates the three-way match, creating significant financial and audit risk.

|---------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|

| Vendor Invoice Received         | 2024-02-07 08:00    |                                          |
| Match Invoice to PO             | 2024-02-07 08:30    |                                          |
| Release Payment                 | 2024-02-07 09:00    |                                          |
| Close Case                      | 2024-02-08 11:00    |                                          |

**Why This Is Problematic**  
- *Receiving goods prior to issuing the PO* means receiving without an authorized order. This “blind receiving” inflates the risk of receiving unwanted or incorrect items, complicates inventory control, and breaks the audit trail.  
- Even though the PO is issued five minutes later, the system can’t retroactively guarantee that the receipt corresponds to an approved order.

---

## Key Risks & Root Causes  
1. **Segregation of Duties Violations**: When approvals occur after payment or authorization steps are skipped, individuals may both approve and execute transactions, increasing fraud risk.  
2. **Failure of Three-Way Match Controls**: Paying invoices without verifying against POs and receipts can cause overpayments, duplicate payments, or payment for nonexistent goods/services.  
3. **Compliance and Audit Failures**: Regulatory and internal audit standards require a clear paper trail. Out-of-sequence activities erode that trail.  
4. **Operational Inefficiencies**: Rework, exception handling, and dispute resolution increase when anomalies occur, driving up cycle times and costs.

---

## Recommendations  
- Enforce system-level validations that strictly sequence activities (e.g., block PO issuance until approval is recorded).  
- Implement mandatory three-way match checks before payment release.  
- Strengthen role-based access controls to ensure segregation of duties (e.g., procurement vs. finance).  
- Monitor process-mining dashboards or exception reports daily to catch and remediate out-of-sequence events in near real-time.  

By correcting these anomalies, the organization will reduce financial risk, improve compliance, and streamline its Procure-to-Pay process.
