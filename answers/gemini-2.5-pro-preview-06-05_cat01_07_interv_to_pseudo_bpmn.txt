**Sequence Flow (Happy Path):**

1.  **Task: Receive and Triage Invoice**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk (Mary)
    *   **Description:** The AP Clerk receives the invoice.

2.  **Exclusive Gateway: Check for Purchase Order (PO)**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk (Mary)
    *   **Condition:** Does the invoice contain a valid PO number?
        *   **Path 1 (No PO):** See **Exception Flow 1**.

    *   **Description:** The Purchasing Officer sends a confirmation back to the AP Clerk, typically via email. This is a handoff back to the AP lane.

8.  **Task: Match Invoice to PO in System**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk (Mary)
    *   **Description:** Upon receiving confirmation from Purchasing, the AP Clerk performs a final, system-based matching of the invoice line items against the PO.

9.  **Exclusive Gateway: System Match Confirmation**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk (Mary)
    *   **Condition:** Is the invoice-to-PO match successful in the system?
        *   **Path 1 (Discrepancy Found):** See **Exception Flow 3**.
        *   **Path 2 (Match Confirmed):** The process continues.

10. **Task: Request Manager Approval**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk (Mary) / System
    *   **Description:** An automatic notification is sent to the relevant Department Manager for final sign-off. This is a handoff to the Department Management lane.

**End Event:** The process concludes when the invoice is scheduled for payment.
*   **Outcome:** `Payment Scheduled`.

#### **3. Exception and Variation Flows**

**Exception Flow 1: Handling Missing PO Number**
*   **Trigger:** `Exclusive Gateway: Check for Purchase Order` -> Path `No PO`.
*   **Sub-Process:**
    1.  **Task: Request PO from Supplier**
        *   **Role:** AP Clerk (Mary)
        *   **Description:** The clerk contacts the supplier to request a PO number or a revised invoice. The process for this invoice is paused or terminated until a valid response is received.
    2.  **Task: Handle Special "No PO" Invoice**
        *   **Role:** AP Clerk (Mary) -> AP Supervisor (Rita)
        *   **Description:** For certain invoices (e.g., informally contracted services) that are known to lack a PO, the AP Clerk escalates to the AP Supervisor. The Supervisor works with department heads to resolve (e.g., create a retrospective PO).
    *   **Outcome:** The invoice either re-enters the main flow at `Step 3: Log Invoice in System` or is rejected.

**Exception Flow 2: Handling Discrepancies (Purchasing Validation)**
*   **Trigger:** `Exclusive Gateway: PO-Invoice Match (Purchasing Validation)` -> Path `Discrepancy Found`.
*   **Sub-Process:**
    1.  **Task: Notify AP of Discrepancy**
        *   **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)
        *   **Description:** Purchasing informs the AP Clerk about the issue and may request that the invoice be put on hold.
    2.  **Collaborative Task: Resolve Discrepancy with Supplier**
        *   **Roles:** Purchasing Officer (Dan), AP Clerk (Mary), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
        *   **Description:** The team contacts the supplier for clarification or a corrected invoice. The Supplier Relationship Manager may be looped in to leverage their contacts and contractual knowledge.
    *   **Outcome:** Once a corrected invoice is received or the issue is clarified, the process returns to `Step 5: Validate Invoice Against PO` for re-validation.

**Exception Flow 3: Handling Discrepancies (AP System Match)**
*   **Trigger:** `Exclusive Gateway: System Match Confirmation` -> Path `Discrepancy Found`.
*   **Sub-Process:**
    1.  **Task: Clarify with Purchasing**
        *   **Role:** AP Clerk (Mary)
        *   **Description:** The AP Clerk contacts the Purchasing team to resolve the mismatch.
    2.  **Task: Escalate to Supervisor**
        *   **Role:** AP Clerk (Mary) -> AP Supervisor (Rita)
        *   **Description:** If the discrepancy cannot be easily resolved with Purchasing, the issue is escalated to the AP Supervisor for coordination and resolution.
    *   **Outcome:** Once resolved, the process returns to `Step 8: Match Invoice to PO in System`.

**Exception Flow 4: Handling Manager Rejection**
*   **Trigger:** `Exclusive Gateway: Managerial Decision` -> Path `Reject or Hold`.
*   **Sub-Process:**
    1.  **Task: Notify AP of Rejection/Hold**
        *   **Role:** Department Manager (Carlos)
        *   **Description:** The manager rejects the invoice in the system and notifies the AP Clerk to hold and investigate further.
    2.  **Task: Investigate Rejection Cause**
        *   **Role:** AP Clerk (Mary)
        *   **Description:** The AP Clerk investigates the reason for rejection, which may require re-engaging with Purchasing or the Supervisor.
    *   **Outcome:** The process loops back to an earlier stage (e.g., `Step 5` or `Step 8`) for re-validation or is terminated.

#### **4. Key Artifacts/Data Objects**

*   **Invoice:** The primary document that initiates and flows through the process.
*   **Purchase Order (PO):** The reference document used for validation.
*   **Logged Invoice Record:** The digital representation of the invoice in the accounting system.
*   **Confirmation Email/Notification:** Digital messages used for handoffs and approvals.
*   **Corrected Invoice:** An artifact generated by the supplier during an exception flow.
