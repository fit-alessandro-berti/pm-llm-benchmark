Here is a DuckDB SQL query that excludes all events from cases where the exact three-step sequence occurs in direct succession and the time between "Create Order" and "Confirm Order" in that sequence exceeds 5 days:

WITH ordered AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    "timestamp",
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp", activity) AS rn
  FROM event_log
),
triples AS (
  SELECT
    o1.case_id,
    o1.rn AS rn1,
    o1.activity AS act1,
    o2.activity AS act2,
    o3.activity AS act3,
    o2."timestamp" AS ts_create_order,
    o3."timestamp" AS ts_confirm_order
  FROM ordered o1
  JOIN ordered o2
    ON o2.case_id = o1.case_id AND o2.rn = o1.rn + 1
  JOIN ordered o3
    ON o3.case_id = o1.case_id AND o3.rn = o1.rn + 2
  WHERE o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
bad_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM triples
  WHERE (ts_confirm_order - ts_create_order) > INTERVAL 5 DAY
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM bad_cases)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e."timestamp", e.activity;
