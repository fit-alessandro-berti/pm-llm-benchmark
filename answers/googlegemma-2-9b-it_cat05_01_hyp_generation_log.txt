## Analyze Order Event Log for Anomalies and Provide SQL Queries

**Context**:

You are provided with an event log containing records of activities during the order fulfillment process.  Your task is to analyze this log for potential anomalies and undesirable behaviors.

Based on your analysis, formulate hypotheses for the causes of these anomalies and design SQL queries to investigate them further using the `order_event_log`, `orders`, and `resources` tables. 

**Output Guidelines**:

1. **Identify Anomalies**: State what constitutes an unusual pattern or event in the log data.
2. **Hypothesis Generation**: For each identified anomaly, propose possible explanations.
3. **SQL Queries**: Provide SQL queries that can be used to:
    - Extract relevant data to support your hypotheses.
    - Analyze the data to gain further insights into the anomalies.

**No specific hints or guidance are provided. You need to rely solely on the information given in the tables and schemas.**


 Remember to clearly label your hypotheses and SQL queries for better understanding.
