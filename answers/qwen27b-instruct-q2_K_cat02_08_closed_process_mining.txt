Sure! Here are explanations for each term listed above alongside proposed opposite concepts and more general concepts:

### Proposed Opposite Concepts

#### Automated Process Discovery  
1. **Manual Process Mapping**: This involves manually identifying processes within an organization without relying on automation tools.
   
   Manual process mapping often involves human effort where the process steps are identified through interviews with stakeholders, manual observation of workflows/document flows etc., requiring direct interaction.

#### Predictive Monitoring  
2. **reactive monitoring**: Reactive monitoring focuses purely on reacting to events rather than predicting them beforehand
   
   Reactive monitoring involves noticing issues or system behaviors when they occur without predicting their occurrence beforehand.

#### Bottom-up Discovery  
3. **Top-down Strategy**: Top-down approach begins from the broad perspective then narrows down specifics of the processes to understand bottom-up.

   The top-down strategy starts with looking at high-level organizational goals then breaking them down step by step until granular process level is reached.

#### Process Simulation  
4. **Process Execution**: Simulation refers towards predicting possible outcomes under certain conditions instead of actual execution.

   Process execution simply refers towards the actual performance of processes or tasks rather than simulating their behavior beforehand.

#### Process Efficiency  

5. **Process Inefficiency/Effectiveness**: These terms are the opposite concept to process efficiency.

    Process inefficiency covers situations where processes fail optimally utilize resources while process effectiveness measures how well established objectives are achieved irrespective resource allocation issues.

#### Real-time Monitoring  
6. **Post-mortem Analysis**: This involves analyzing events after they have occurred instead of monitoring them in real-time.

   Post-mortem analysis focuses towards identifying errors or patterns post event execution to gain insights rather than gaining insight during process execution.


### Proposed General Concepts

#### Process Automation:
This encompasses all forms of automation employed in identifying processes within an organization by utilizing automated tools for discovery purposes.

#### Predictive Analytics:
Comprehensive field beyond just monitoring involves predictive analytics that employs statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to forecast possibilities before they occur.

#### Full Lifecycle Management :
Concept encompassing all aspects involved during creation, identification, optimization up until the point of elimination or deprecation processes.

#### Real-Time Control:
Constitutes mechanisms involved in monitoring events on-the-go allowing for immediate adjustments or responses based upon current status.

### General Concept: Organizational Process Management Framework:
Encompasses techniques involving full cycle management including but not limited to process identification, optimization/improvement strategies while accounting for continuous evaluation and adaptation towards efficient operations within respective organizational goals.
