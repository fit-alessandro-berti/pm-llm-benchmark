**Solution:**

**1. Identifying Cases with Longer Resolution Times:**

First, let's calculate the total resolution time for each case:

- **Case 101:**  
  Start: 2024-03-01 08:00  
  End: 2024-03-01 10:15  
  Total Time: 2 hours and 15 minutes

- **Case 102:**  
  Start: 2024-03-01 08:05  
  End: 2024-03-02 09:15  
  Total Time: 25 hours and 10 minutes

- **Case 103:**  
  Start: 2024-03-01 08:10  
  End: 2024-03-01 09:30  
  Total Time: 1 hour and 20 minutes

- **Case 104:**  
  Start: 2024-03-01 08:20  
  End: 2024-03-02 08:30  
  Total Time: 24 hours and 10 minutes

- **Case 105:**  
  Start: 2024-03-01 08:25  
  End: 2024-03-03 09:30  
  Total Time: 31 hours and 5 minutes

From these calculations, Cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer resolution times compared to Case 101 and 103.

**2. Determining Root Causes:**

- **Case 102:**  
  - The ticket was escalated to a Level-2 Agent after 3 hours of Level-1 Agent handling.
  - A 5-hour gap between the escalation event and the investigation by the Level-2 Agent.

- **Case 104:**  
  - A 4-hour gap between assigning the ticket to a Level-1 Agent and starting the investigation.

- **Case 105:**  
  - Similar to Case 102, the ticket was escalated after 1 hour of Level-1 Agent handling.
  - An additional 17 hours passed before the Level-2 Agent started investigating the issue.

**3. Explaining and Recommending Solutions:**

**Factors Leading to Increased Cycle Times:**

- **Escalation Delays:** In Cases 102 and 105, the decision to escalate the ticket to a Level-2 Agent was made relatively early, but there was a significant delay (5 hours and 17 hours, respectively) before the Level-2 Agent began the investigation. This suggests either a lack of available Level-2 Agents or inefficient communication between teams.

- **Long Waiting Times:** Case 104 had a long waiting time (4 hours) between assigning the ticket to a Level-1 Agent and starting the investigation. This could be due to the agent being busy or not prioritizing the ticket promptly.

**Recommendations:**

- **Improve Communication and Coordination:** Ensure efficient communication channels between Level-1 and Level-2 agents to minimize delays in transferring escalated tickets.
  
- **Optimize Agent Scheduling:** Implement a more dynamic scheduling system that balances the workload between Level-1 and Level-2 agents to prevent bottlenecks.

- **Enhance Ticket Prioritization:** Develop a robust prioritization system to ensure critical issues are addressed promptly, reducing unnecessary waiting times for investigations.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback:** Regularly analyze ticket resolution times and root causes to identify trends and areas for improvement. Implement feedback loops to adjust processes proactively.

By addressing these identified factors, the customer support team can streamline the resolution process and reduce cycle times, leading to improved customer satisfaction.
