1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns  
1.1 Metrics and KPIs  
• Workload Distribution  
– Tickets handled per agent, per tier, per time period  
– Skilltype volumes (e.g. number of NetworkingFirewall tickets)  
• Activity Processing Times  
– Average time per activity (“Work L1 StartEnd”, “Work L2 StartEnd”) by agent and tier  
– Waiting times in queues (time between “Assign” and “Work Start”)  
• FirstCall Resolution (FCR) Rate (L1)  
– % of tickets created and closed without escalation  
• Reassignment and Escalation Frequency  
– # of reassignments per ticket; escalations L1L2, L2L3  
• SLA Compliance  
– % of P1–P4 tickets resolved within target times, by agent and tier  
1.2 Process Mining Techniques  
• Resource Interaction Analysis (HandoverofWork)  
– Build a directed network where nodes are agents/tiers and edges weight = # tickets passed between them  
– Identify “traffic jams” (heavy edges) and circular handovers  
• Social Network / Role Discovery  
– Cluster agents by actual activity patterns (who works together, who escalates to whom) vs. the intended tierbased design  
• Conformance Checking  
– Compare the discovered assignment paths against the official escalation flowchart (L1L2L3)  
– Highlight deviations: L1L3 direct escalations, repeated L2 reassignments  
1.3 Skill Utilization Analysis  
• Map each ticket’s Required Skill to the Assigned Agent’s documented skills  
– % of cases where agent possesses the required skill at “Assign” vs. those where a reassignment is needed for skill mismatch  
• Specialist vs. Generalist Usage  
– Frequency specialists handle simple (P4) tickets vs. complex (P2/P1) tickets  
– Idle times or low utilization periods for highly specialized agents  

2. Identifying ResourceRelated Bottlenecks and Issues  
2.1 Skill Shortages  
• Compute average waiting time for tickets requiring each skill; identify skills with queue times above threshold  
• Count tickets escalated more than once for the same skill  
2.2 Reassignment and Escalation Delays  
• Measure delay introduced per reassignment (time between “Work End” on old assignment and “Work Start” on new) – e.g. 45 min average delay per reassignment  
• % of tickets with more than one reassignment; correlate with SLA breach rate  
2.3 Incorrect Initial Assignments  
• Identify tickets where L1 assigned an agent lacking the required skill  forced escalation/reassignment  
• Quantify: 30% of P2 tickets misrouted at L1, leading to average 1.2 h extra delay  
2.4 Overload and UnderUtilization  
• Gini coefficient or variance of ticket counts per agent  
• Identify agents consistently above 90th percentile in workload vs. those below 10th  
2.5 SLA Breach Correlations  
• Run a correlation or decision tree: features = #reassignments, waiting times, tier transitions, skill mismatch flag; target = SLA breach  
• E.g. tickets with >2 reassignments and initial skill mismatch have a 65% breach rate  

3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies  
3.1 Potential Root Causes  
• Roundrobin ignores skill requirements and current workload  
• Agent skill profiles outdated or incomplete  misfits at assignment  
• Ticket categorization at intake too coarse  wrong Required Skill tag  
• No realtime dashboard for dispatchers to see live agent workloads  
• L1 agents undertrained, escalating prematurely rather than attempting known fixes  
3.2 Variant Analysis and Decision Mining  
• Variant Analysis  
– Compare “good” variants (singleassignment, fast resolution) vs. “bad” variants (multiple reassignments, SLA breach)  
– Highlight differences in: ticket categories, time of day, dispatcher vs. selfassign  
• Decision Mining  
– Extract decision rules at each “Assign” activity: inputs = Priority, Category, Required Skill, current workload; output = chosen agent/tier  
– Identify if rules are driven by outdated heuristics or nontransparent manual biases  

4. Developing DataDriven Resource Assignment Strategies  
Strategy A: SkillBased Routing with Proficiency Weighting  
• Issue Addressed: Misassignments and reassignments due to skill mismatch  
• Insight Leveraged: Skill mismatch correlation with delays and SLA breaches  
• Implementation:  
– Maintain a matrix of agent skills + proficiency scores (1–5)  
– At assignment, route ticket to agent with highest proficiency for Required Skill and available capacity  
• Data Required: Uptodate skill profiles, realtime availability status  
• Expected Benefits:  
–  reassignments by 40%,  average resolution time by 25%,  SLA compliance for P2/P3  
Strategy B: WorkloadAware, TierBalanced Assignment Algorithm  
• Issue Addressed: Uneven workloads and bottlenecks in L2/L3  
• Insight Leveraged: Queue length and idle time metrics per tier  
• Implementation:  
– Realtime queue monitor integrates with assignment logic  
– Dispatch tickets preferentially to tiers/agents below a configurable utilization threshold (e.g. 80%)  
• Data Required: Live ticket queue lengths, agent login/status events, historical handling times  
• Expected Benefits:  
– Smoother workload distribution (Gini index 50%), fewer backlog peaks, improved agent morale  
Strategy C: Predictive Assignment via Machine Learning Classifier  
• Issue Addressed: Incorrect initial categorization and premature escalations  
• Insight Leveraged: Text and attribute patterns from tickets that required L2/L3 vs. those closed at L1  
• Implementation:  
– Train a model on historical tickets: features = description keywords, Category, Priority, time of day; label = final handling tier  
– Use model to recommend L1 vs. direct L2 assignment, or even suggest specific specialists  
• Data Required: Historical ticket texts, event logs, resolution outcomes  
• Expected Benefits:  
–  firstcall resolution by 20%,  average number of escalations per ticket, maintain SLA targets  
4.1 Optional Strategy D: Dynamic TierFlex Pools  
• Crosstrain selected L1 agents in highdemand skills; dynamically move them to L2 pool during peaks  
• Data: Peakperiod ticket arrival patterns, training records  
• Benefit: Elastic capacity for critical skills,  P2 queue times by up to 30%  

5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring  
5.1 Process Simulation  
• Build a discreteevent simulation model using the mined process map, historical interarrival and service time distributions, and resource calendars  
• Simulate baseline vs. each proposed strategy, measuring:  
– Average resolution time, SLA compliance, queue lengths, resource utilization  
• Run sensitivity analyses on staffing levels and skillmix to find optimal configurations  
5.2 Implementation Roadmap  
• Phase 1: Pilot SkillBased Routing on one category (e.g. Network)  
• Phase 2: Deploy WorkloadAware Assignment across all tiers  
• Phase 3: Integrate Predictive Classifier into ticket intake workflow  
• Provide training to dispatchers and L1 agents on new logic and dashboards  
5.3 Continuous Monitoring with ProcessMining Dashboards  
• Key KPIs to track in real time:  
– SLA compliance by priority and category  
– # of reassignments and escalations per ticket  
– Firstcall resolution rate (L1)  
– Agent/tier utilization and queue lengths  
– Average skillmismatch incidents  
• Process Views:  
– Live handover networks to detect emerging bottlenecks  
– Variant explorer comparing current and past performance  
– Decisionrule drift alerts (e.g. if assignment decisions deviate from the new logic)  
• Feedback Loop: Monthly reviews with service managers to refine rules, update skill profiles, and retrain predictive models based on fresh data.
