1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns  
1.1. Key Metrics from the Event Log  
• Workload distribution  
  – Tickets assigned per agent and per tier (L1/L2/L3) over time  
  – Tickets by priority/category/required skill per agent  
• Processing times  
  – Time-to-start (assignment delay) and time-to-complete per activity (“Work L1 Start  Work L1 End”, “Assign  Work Start”)  
  – End-to-end resolution time per tier and overall  
• First-call resolution (FCR) rate for L1  
  – Percent of P2/P3 tickets resolved at L1 without any escalation  
• Escalation and reassignment frequencies  
  – Number and sequence of escalations or reassignments per ticket  
  – Average delay introduced per escalation/reassignment  
• Skill utilization  
  – Share of tickets handled that match each agent’s documented skills  
  – Volume of “over-qualified” work done by L2/L3 (tasks not requiring specialist skills)  
• SLA breach correlation  
  – SLA compliance rate by agent, tier, skill group, and by number of reassignments  

1.2. Process Mining Techniques  
• Resource interaction and handover analysis  
  – Build a handover network: nodes = agents or roles, edges weighted by number of ticket handovers  
  – Identify clusters where tickets “ping-pong” between agents or tiers  
• Social network/role discovery  
  – Detect informal roles (e.g., “de facto L2 networking hub”) by clustering agents who frequently handle or forward firewall tickets  
• Conformance checking vs. intended logic  
  – Model the intended assignment rules (e.g., “round-robin within tier, then skill-match escalation”) in a BPMN or Petri net  
  – Use conformance checking to highlight deviations: manual overrides, mis-routed cases  
• Skill utilization heatmaps  
  – Map required skills on tickets vs. actual handler skill profiles to see mismatches or under-use of specialists  

1.3. Skill-Level Utilization Analysis  
• Compute for each specialist (e.g., Networking-Firewall, DB-SQL):  
  – % of their handled tickets that require their core skill vs. generic work  
  – Waiting time in queues for tickets requiring their skill  
  – Number of adjacent tickets (same skill) escalated to other agents or incorrectly forwarded back to L1  
• Identify skill mismatches  
  – High-skill agents resolving low-skill tickets (opportunity cost)  
  – Low-skill agents escalating tickets they could handle with minimal training  

2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues  
2.1. Pinpointing Problems  
• Skill scarcity bottlenecks  
  – Longest queue lengths, highest wait times for tickets requiring certain skills (e.g., DB-SQL)  
  – SLA breach rate spikes coinciding with peak volumes of those ticket types  
• Reassignment delays  
  – Average  delays per reassignment step; total additional lead time per ticket  
  – % of tickets involving more than two reassignments correlated with SLA violations  
• Incorrect initial assignments  
  – Cases where L1 or dispatcher assigns to an agent lacking the required skill, causing immediate reassignments  
  – Quantify number of minutes lost in detect-escalate cycles  
• Overloaded vs. under-utilized resources  
  – Agents exceeding capacity thresholds (tickets in work > X at any time) vs. idle time of other agents  
  – Correlate workload imbalance with longer processing times and more frequent escalations  

2.2. Quantifying Impact  
• Average reassignment delay: e.g., 45 minutes per reassignment  
• % SLA breaches linked to skill mismatch: e.g., 30% of P2 breaches follow an initial misassignment  
• Opportunity cost: e.g., L3 specialists spend 20% of their time on P4 or generic tickets, equating to X hours/month not applied to critical tickets  

3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies  
3.1. Potential Root Causes  
• Rule deficiencies  
  – Round-robin ignores real-time workload, skill proficiency, ticket complexity  
• Incomplete/inaccurate skill profiles  
  – Missing or outdated skills in agent records leading to misrouting  
• Poor initial ticket triage  
  – Inconsistent categorization or missing “required skill” tags at creation  
• Lack of visibility  
  – Dispatchers and L1 agents cannot see live queue lengths, agent occupancy  
• Training gaps  
  – L1 agents under-trained on certain categories escalate prematurely  

3.2. Using Variant Analysis & Decision Mining  
• Variant comparison  
  – Group “smooth” cases (no reassignments) vs. “churn” cases (>2 reassignments)  
  – Compare attributes: who was assigned first, what time of day, which dispatcher, which category tags  
• Decision mining  
  – Build decision trees on dispatcher assignment events:  
    – Inputs: ticket priority/category/required skill/queue lengths/shift time  
    – Output: to whom it was assigned and whether it later required reassignment  
  – Identify rules that lead to high reassignment probability  

4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies  
Strategy A: Skill-Weighted Routing  
• Issue addressed: initial misassignments, overloading of specialists with generic tickets  
• Insight leveraged: specialist under-utilization on skill-match tasks; high reassignment rates when skill mismatch  
• Data required: up-to-date skill matrix (skill, proficiency level), ticket classification (required skill), agent availability  
• Mechanism: assign incoming tickets preferentially to agents who have the highest proficiency in the required skill, subject to workload caps  
• Expected benefits: fewer reassignments, faster resolution times for specialized tickets, improved SLA compliance  

Strategy B: Workload-Aware Dynamic Assignment  
• Issue addressed: uneven workload distribution, manual round-robin inefficiencies  
• Insight leveraged: resource utilization analysis showing peaks & troughs across agents  
• Data required: real-time queue lengths by skill/tier, agent occupancy status, predicted handle times (historical averages)  
• Mechanism: algorithmically balance assignments to minimize expected waiting time (e.g., shortest-queue or least-utilization first) while ensuring skill match  
• Expected benefits: smoother workload distribution, shorter assignment delays, reduced backlog  

Strategy C: Predictive Triage & Escalation Guidance  
• Issue addressed: premature or unnecessary escalations from L1, SLA breaches on P2/P3  
• Insight leveraged: decision mining that identifies ticket features (keywords, category patterns) predictive of escalation  
• Data required: historical ticket text/description, resolved vs. escalated labels, resolution time, SLA outcomes  
• Mechanism: use a classification model to predict complexity and recommend “resolve at L1” vs. “directly assign to L2/L3” at ticket creation  
• Expected benefits: higher first-call resolution, fewer handovers, better SLA performance  

Strategy D: Dynamic Skill Reallocation & Cross-Training  
• Issue addressed: scarcity of certain skills, idle time of other agents  
• Insight leveraged: skill-utilization heatmaps showing imbalance across skill groups  
• Data required: current ticket skill demand forecast (time-series), agent existing and trainable skill profiles  
• Mechanism: identify upcoming demand peaks for certain skills and dynamically reassign or train nearby-tier agents to fill gaps; partially automate cross-tier staffing swaps  
• Expected benefits: reduced bottlenecks on niche skills, increased flexibility, lower backlog  

5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring  
5.1. Business Process Simulation  
• Build a discrete-event simulation using the mined process model:  
  – Inputs: arrival rates by priority/category, service time distributions per skill/tier, current vs. proposed assignment logic  
  – Scenarios: baseline vs. each new strategy or combinations  
  – Outputs: average resolution times, queue lengths, SLA compliance rates, resource utilization  
• Validate simulation by comparing baseline run results against actual historic KPIs  

5.2. Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan  
• Dashboards and KPI tracking via process mining tool:  
  – Assignment delay: time from Ticket Created to Work Start, by tier and skill  
  – Reassignment rate: % of tickets with >1 assignment, average number of reassignments  
  – First-call resolution rate (L1) and direct-to-L2 rate  
  – SLA compliance % by priority and by initial assignment accuracy  
  – Resource utilization: % busy time vs. idle, both by individual and skill cluster  
  – Handovers network: trending changes in handover density and cycle times  
• Alerts & periodic reviews  
  – SLA breach alarms triggered if P2 compliance falls below threshold  
  – Monthly root-cause deep dives on tickets still experiencing multiple reassignments  

By systematically mining resource behaviors, quantifying inefficiencies, uncovering root causes, and validating new assignment logics through simulation and continuous monitoring, TechSolve can dramatically reduce SLA breaches, minimize reassignments, and make optimal use of its multi-tiered, multi-skilled support organization.
