Below is an example DuckDB SQL query that meets the requirements:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

**Explanation:**

1. The inner subquery:
   - Groups the events by `case_id`.
   - Uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to filter for cases with six or fewer total events.
   
2. The outer query:
   - Selects all columns from `event_log`.
   - Restricts the results to only those `case_id`s returned by the inner subquery.
   
This ensures that the final result set includes all events from only those cases that have six or fewer events in total.
