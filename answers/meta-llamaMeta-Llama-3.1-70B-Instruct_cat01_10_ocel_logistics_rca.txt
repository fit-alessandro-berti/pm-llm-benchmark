Analyzing the provided directly follows graph for different object types, several insights can be derived that may indicate root causes for performance issues in the process. These insights are based on the frequency of events, the number of objects involved, and the duration of these events across different object types.

1. **Long Duration of "pay order" -> "pick item" and "reorder item" -> "pick item"**: 
   - For the "items" object type, the transitions from "pay order" to "pick item" and from "reorder item" to "pick item" have significantly long durations (429073.36 and 564359.01, respectively). This suggests a potential bottleneck or inefficiency in the payment processing or reordering process that delays the picking of items.

2. **High Frequency and Duration of Loops**: 
   - In the "employees" object type, the self-loop "pick item" -> "pick item" and "confirm order" -> "confirm order" show high frequencies and durations. This could indicate inefficiencies or repetitive tasks in the picking and order confirmation processes.
   - Similarly, in the "products" object type, several transitions show high frequencies and durations, indicating potential inefficiencies or bottlenecks in the process flow.

3. **High Duration of "package delivered" -> "pay order" and "package delivered" -> "payment reminder"**:
   - The long durations for the transitions from "package delivered" to "pay order" and to "payment reminder" (452919.25 and 1127921.43, respectively) in the "items" object type suggest issues in the payment collection or reminder processes, potentially due to delayed payments or ineffective reminders.

4. **Variability in Process Flow**:
   - The presence of numerous transitions with varying frequencies and durations across different object types ("products", "packages") indicates a complex process with many possible paths. This complexity can lead to inefficiencies and bottlenecks, especially if not all paths are equally optimized.

5. **Potential Overload in "pick item" and "confirm order" Processes**:
   - The high frequency of events involving "pick item" and "confirm order" across several object types may indicate that these processes are bottlenecks or are overloaded, leading to performance issues.

Addressing these specific process and data-related issues could involve streamlining payment and reordering processes, optimizing the picking and order confirmation tasks, improving the efficiency of package delivery and payment collection, and simplifying the process flow to reduce complexity and variability.
