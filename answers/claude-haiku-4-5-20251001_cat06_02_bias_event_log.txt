# Bias Analysis: Event Log Review

## Primary Bias Mechanisms Identified

### 1. **Community Affiliation Bias (Structural)**

**The Bias:**
- Cases with "Highland Civic Darts Club" affiliation (C001, C004) receive **+10 score adjustment**
- Cases with "None" affiliation (C002, C003, C005) receive **0 adjustment**
- This creates a **systematic 10-point advantage** based purely on group membership

**Critical Issue:**
- C004 (score 690 + 10 = 700) **Approved**
- C003 (score 715 + 0 = 715) **Rejected**
- A non-member with a **25-point higher base score is rejected**, while a member with a lower base score is approved

### 2. **Geographic Residency Bias (Eligibility Gate)**

**Pattern Observed:**
| LocalResident | Approval Rate |
|---------------|---------------|
| TRUE          | 3/3 (100%)    |
| FALSE         | 1/2 (50%)     |

- Non-residents face an implicit disadvantage
- Combined with community affiliation bias, creates **compounded exclusion**

## Equity Violation: The C003 vs. C004 Case Study

| Attribute | C003 | C004 |
|-----------|------|------|
| Base Score | 715 | 690 |
| Community Group | None | Highland Civic Darts Club |
| Score Adjustment | 0 | +10 |
| Final Score | 715 | 700 |
| Outcome | **REJECTED** | **APPROVED** |
| Difference | C003 has 15 points higher; still rejected | — |

**This demonstrates direct discriminatory impact:** An applicant with objectively stronger creditworthiness (715 vs. 700) is rejected due to lack of community affiliation.

## Systemic Fairness Issues

### **1. Proxy Discrimination Risk**
- Community group membership may correlate with:
  - Socioeconomic status
  - Social networks
  - Geographic clustering
  - Demographic characteristics
- The +10 adjustment lacks transparent justification
- Scoring Engine applies it **automatically** (not merit-based)

### **2. Disparate Impact**
- Non-members and non-residents face systematic disadvantage
- Even high-performing applicants can be rejected
- The rule is **facially neutral** but **operationally discriminatory**

### **3. Lack of Transparency in Adjustment Logic**
- No documented rationale for why "Community" deserves +10
- Manual Review stage doesn't appear to challenge this adjustment
- Reviewers (Reviewer #7, #2) don't override or question the bias

---

## Implications for Fairness & Equity

### **Who Suffers:**
1. **Non-residents** without community ties (C003, C005)
2. **Individuals without social capital** to join civic organizations
3. **Marginalized groups** potentially less likely to be part of established community groups
4. **New to area/transient populations**

### **Systemic Harm:**
- Perpetuates existing social advantage
- Creates **path dependency**: community membership becomes prerequisite
- Excludes qualified applicants based on **social access**, not creditworthiness
- Violates **equal opportunity** principles in lending/approval decisions

## Recommendations

| Issue | Corrective Action |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Community bias** | Eliminate +10 adjustment OR require evidence community membership improves repayment; validate through data analysis |
| **Residency bias** | Remove LocalResident as decision factor unless legally justified; analyze disparate impact |
| **Manual review gaps** | Train reviewers to identify and flag score adjustments; require justification; escalate anomalies |
| **Transparency** | Document scoring criteria; conduct fairness audits; test for disparate impact by group |
| **Alternative criteria** | Replace social affiliation with objective factors: credit history, income stability, payment patterns |

---

## Conclusion

**The process exhibits clear bias favoring community group members and local residents through:**
- Automatic scoring adjustments (not merit-based)
- Lack of compensating controls in manual review
- Disparate outcomes despite similar or superior creditworthiness

This violates **fairness principles** and likely legal standards for non-discrimination in lending/approval processes.
