- It is a two-panel time-line visualization spanning from about 2000 to 2013.
- Top panel (gray): a dense field of vertical gray lines labeled “Send Fine.” Each line represents a fine-issuance event for a case, so this panel shows when fines were sent over the entire period.
- Divider line labeled “Insert Fine Notification” separates the two panels.
- Bottom panel (red and gray diagonal lines): shows the flow toward credit collection. Each diagonal line represents a case moving from the fine/notification stage to the credit-collection stage; red tint emphasizes the credit-collection path. The lines slope from left to right, indicating the elapsed time from the earlier event to the later one (send for credit collection).
- The x-axis at the bottom is a time axis with marks at 2000, 2006, and 2013.
- Overall interpretation: there is heavy activity in issuing fines across the whole period, and a downstream, more varied duration for cases that go to credit collection. Each line tracks an individual case’s progression through the process over time.
