Based on the provided data, here's a description of the underlying process with its variants:

**Process Name:** Declaration Process

**Initial State:** Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE

**Main Flow:**

1. **Employee Submission:** An employee submits a declaration.
2. **Administrative Approval (A):** The submitted declaration is reviewed and approved by an administrator.
   - If approved, it proceeds to the supervisor for final approval (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
3. **Budget Owner Approval (B):** After administrative approval, some declarations may require budget owner approval before final approval by the supervisor.
   - If approved, it proceeds to the supervisor for final approval (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
4. **Supervisor Final Approval:** The supervisor reviews and approves the declaration.
   - If approved, a payment request is made (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`).

**Variants:**

1. **Direct Supervisor Approval:** Some declarations go directly to the supervisor for final approval after administrative approval without requiring budget owner approval (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).

2. **Pre-Approver Involvement:** In some cases, a pre-approver is involved before the declaration reaches the supervisor.
   - If approved, it proceeds to the supervisor (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
   - If rejected, the employee can resubmit after rejection (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

3. **Rejection Loops:** There are multiple loops where declarations can be rejected and resubmitted:
   - Rejected by Administrator: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`
   - Rejected by Supervisor: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`
   - Rejected by Budget Owner: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`

4. **Multiple Rejections:** Some declarations can go through multiple rejection loops before being approved (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`).

5. **Saved Declarations:** Some declarations are saved by employees without submission (`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`).

6. **Payment Handled:** After final approval, a payment request is made and handled (`Request Payment -> Payment Handled`).

7. **Missing Information Rejection:** There's a variant where declarations are rejected due to missing information after being approved by the supervisor (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

The frequencies and performances provided indicate how often each variant occurs and the time taken for that specific path, respectively.
