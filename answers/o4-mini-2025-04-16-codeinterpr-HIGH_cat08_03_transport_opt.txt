Below is a structured, end-to-end process-mining approach for Speedy Parcels, addressing each of the five requested points.

1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking  
———————————————————  
a) Data Preprocessing & Integration  
• Define your “case” as Vehicle-Day (e.g. V12-20241205) and link all events by that Case ID.  
• Normalize timestamps (all logs to UTC/local common clock).  
• Map GPS pings to semantic activities via geo-fencing (e.g. Depot, Customer Stop, Traffic Jam Hotspot, Maintenance Bay).  
• Merge:  
  – Dispatch events (planned “Route Assigned” + sequence of stops)  
  – Scanner milestones (arrival, delivery success/fail, depart)  
  – GPS status (movement, idling, low-speed alerts)  
  – Maintenance starts/ends  
• Challenges:  
  – Heterogeneous granularity (GPS every 10 s vs scanner only at stops)  
  – Missing or duplicated timestamps  
  – Mapping GPS noise to real events (parking vs traffic jam)  
  – Aligning dispatch’s abstract “Stop #” with actual GPS coordinates  

b) Process Discovery  
• Event classes: Depart-Depot, Drive, Arrive-Customer, Service-Start (scan), Service-End (scan), Unplanned-Stop, Maintenance, Return-Depot, End-Shift.  
• Use a mining algorithm (e.g. Inductive Miner for a precise, block-structured model or Fuzzy Miner to expose performance hotspots).  
• Result: a visual process map showing all common paths (successful delivery sequence vs failed attempts vs maintenance detours).  

c) Conformance Checking  
• Import the planned route (sequence of Stop IDs) as a reference model.  
• Replay the actual log against the planned model using alignment-based conformance checking.  
• Key deviations to detect:  
  – Missing stops (skipped customer)  
  – Reordered stops (visit #3 before #2)  
  – Extra stops (unscheduled maintenance, refuel, coffee breaks)  
  – Timing deviations (planned travel 10 min vs actual 25 min)  
• Metrics: fitness (how many planned stops were actually visited), precision (no “wild” extra behaviors), and average lateness per stop.  

2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification  
————————————————————————  
a) Define KPIs and How to Compute Them  
• On-Time Delivery Rate = (# deliveries completed within customer window) / (total deliveries).  
   – Use scanner timestamps vs dispatch time windows.  
• Average Time per Stop = avg(Depart_Customer – Arrive_Customer).  
• Travel Time vs Service Time Ratio = (sum of all Drive durations) / (sum of all Service durations).  
• Fuel Consumption per km/package = if no direct fuel sensor, approximate via distance (Haversine on GPS) × vehicle-specific mpg, or use periodic odometer readings.  
• Vehicle Utilization Rate = (Drive + Service time) / (Shift length).  
• Traffic Delay Frequency & Duration = count & sum of GPS “Low Speed” events per route segment.  
• Failed Delivery Rate = (# Delivery_Failed events) / (total attempts).  

b) Bottleneck Identification via Process Mining Techniques  
• Performance-annotated process maps: color edges/nodes by average duration (red = slowest).  
• Dotted charts & timelines: spot clusters of long idle times or repeated rework loops.  
• Variant analysis: rank the top N most frequent route-variants vs their average cycle times.  
• Cross-case filters: isolate by route zone, time-of-day, vehicle type or driver to pinpoint hot spots.  
• Quantification: e.g. “Route Zone A has avg. travel time 30 % above company average at 8–10 AM, costing 45 min extra per shift.”  

3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies  
——————————————————  
Beyond “where” you see delays, drill into “why” via:  
• Variant Comparison  
  – Compare high-performing vs low-performing variants: e.g. Fleet_Year2019 vans vs newer Fleet_Year2021 show 15 % less idling.  
• Decision Mining  
  – On each edge (DriveArrive_Customer), mine rules: e.g. if departure after 08:30 AM AND zone = downtown  arrival delay >10 min in 85 % of cases.  
• Correlation with External Factors  
  – Overlay traffic-congestion indices or weather data to validate that low-speed GPS clusters correspond to rush-hour jams.  
• Service Time Variability  
  – Histogram service durations by customer type (residential vs business) to see if certain addresses systematically take longer.  
• Maintenance Impact  
  – Trace maintenance events: quantify unplanned stops’ frequency & extra downtime per vehicle, correlate with mileage or average speed.  
• Driver Behavior  
  – Cluster drivers by average speed, idling time, route deviations; root causes might include unfamiliarity with zones or aggressive vs cautious driving.  
• Failed Delivery Analysis  
  – Identify addresses with repeated failures, group by reason (“customer not home,” “access denied”) to see if time-window misalignment or lack of notification is the culprit.  

4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies  
————————————————  
Strategy 1: Dynamic, Real-Time Routing  
• Targeted Inefficiency: traffic-related delays in peak hours  
• Root Cause: static preplanned routes can’t adapt to congestion  
• How Insights Support It: process map shows heavy rework loops and low-speed hotspots on certain edges at 8–10 AM  
• Expected KPI Impact: –15 % travel time, +10 pp On-Time Rate  

Strategy 2: Historical-Data-Driven Route Sequencing  
• Targeted Inefficiency: suboptimal stop order leading to backtracking  
• Root Cause: manual or naïve nearest-neighbor heuristics ignore real travel times  
• How Insights Support It: variant analysis reveals the top 5 fastest sequences for each route cluster  
• Expected KPI Impact: –8 % fuel per km, –5 min avg. time per stop  

Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling  
• Targeted Inefficiency: unplanned maintenance stops causing downtime  
• Root Cause: purely calendarbased maintenance misses usagebased wear patterns  
• How Insights Support It: maintenance events correlate strongly with days exceeding X km or Y hrs idling  
• Expected KPI Impact: –30 % unscheduled stops, +5 % vehicle utilization  

Strategy 4: Targeted Driver Coaching & Incentives  
• Targeted Inefficiency: high variability in service time and excessive idling  
• Root Cause: inexperienced drivers or lack of standardized customer-interaction procedures  
• How Insights Support It: driver clusters show 20 % faster service times when following a 5-step standardized protocol  
• Expected KPI Impact: –10 % avg. time per stop, +3 pp On-Time Rate  

5. Operational Constraints & Continuous Monitoring  
————————————————————  
a) Accounting for Constraints  
• In all optimizers embed driver workhour rules (EU Driving Time Regulations or local labor laws).  
• Respect vehicle capacity (weight/volume) when assigning packages to routes.  
• Honor customer time windows as hard constraints in dynamic routing.  

b) Ongoing Monitoring Plan  
• Deploy a process-mining dashboard (e.g. Celonis, Disco, ProM, or Power BI + PM add-in) showing:  
  – Real-time conformance score vs planned routes  
  – KPI trend charts (On-Time Rate, Avg. Stop Time, Utilization)  
  – Live “slow edge” heat map of the network to detect emerging traffic issues  
  – Variant explorer filtering by driver/vehicle/zone for early anomaly detection  
• Set alert thresholds (e.g. if On-Time Rate falls >5 pp week-over-week or unscheduled stops spike +20 %).  
• Quarterly deep-dives: re-mine variants and rerun bottleneck analyses to capture new patterns as operations grow.

By tightly coupling rich, multi-source event logs with process-mining discovery, conformance, performance and root-cause techniques, Speedy Parcels can turn raw GPS/scanner/dispatch/maintenance data into actionable optimizations—significantly boosting punctuality, lowering fuel and maintenance costs, and building a living decision-support system that adapts as city traffic and business needs evolve.
