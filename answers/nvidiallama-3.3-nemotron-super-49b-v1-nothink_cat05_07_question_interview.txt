Below is a list of targeted, open-ended questions to clarify and deepen the understanding of the property onboarding process:

### **Clarifying Decision Criteria & Processes**

1. **Documentation Review**: What are the most common missing or outdated documents encountered during the initial review, and how does this impact the onboarding timeline?
2. **Property Manager Assignment**: Can you elaborate on the weighting of factors (workload, geographic specialization, experience, track record) when assigning a property manager?
3. **Inspector Findings**: What are the typical safety or habitability issues found, and are there predefined protocols for addressing each type of issue with landlords?
4. **Tenant Selection**: Beyond the basic criteria, what influences the decision when multiple equally qualified tenants are interested in the same unit?

### **Roles and Responsibilities**

5. **Property Coordinator vs. Property Manager**: Are there any overlaps in their responsibilities post-property manager assignment, or is the handoff complete?
6. **Leasing Agent’s Role**: In what scenarios does a leasing agent take over from the property manager, and what are their specific responsibilities?
7. **Compliance & Financial Review**: Can you outline the specific aspects of the lease that the compliance officer and financial analyst review, and what actions are taken if discrepancies are found?

### **Timing and Sequencing**

8. **Typical Onboarding Duration**: What is the average time taken for a property to be fully on-boarded from initial contact to activation in the rental portal?
9. **Concurrent Processes**: Are any steps (e.g., marketing preparation, inspector scheduling) initiated concurrently with others to reduce overall time, or are they strictly sequential?
10. **Move-in Date Scheduling**: What factors determine the move-in date (e.g., tenant preference, repair timelines, existing lease endings)?

### **Exceptions and Special Cases**

11. **Custom Lease Clauses**: How often do landlords request custom clauses, and what is the approval process for such requests?
12. **Special Insurance Requirements**: Can you describe a scenario where special insurance was required, and how this altered the onboarding process?
13. **Dispute Resolution**: Are there documented procedures for resolving disputes between landlords, tenants, and the company during the onboarding process?

### **Communication, Tools, and Quality Control**

14. **Communication Protocols**: How do you ensure consistent communication across all stakeholders (internal teams, landlords, tenants), especially in complex or delayed onboarding cases?
15. **Toolset Integration**: Are the internal CRM, project management tools, and property database fully integrated, or are there manual sync processes?
16. **Post-Onboarding Review**: Is there a formal review process after a property is activated to identify improvements for the onboarding process?

### **Scalability and Future Development**

17. **Scalability Challenges**: As the portfolio grows, what are the anticipated bottlenecks in the current onboarding process, and how are you planning to address them?
18. **Technology Enhancement**: Are there plans to leverage technology (e.g., AI for document review, automated marketing tools) to streamline the onboarding process in the future?
