Here is a Python code snippet that can help you generate a temporal profile for the given process:

```python
import pandas as pd
from collections import defaultdict

# Define the process variants as a list of tuples
process_variants = [
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine"),
    ("Create Fine", "Payment"),
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty"),
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty", "Payment"),
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Payment", "Add penalty", "Payment"),
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Payment", "Add penalty", "Send for Credit Collection"),
    #... (rest of the process variants)
]

# Define the performance and frequency of each process variant
performance = {
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine"): 8380516.026,
    ("Create Fine", "Payment"): 889688.400,
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty"): 8380516.026,
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty", "Payment"): 35037723.025,
    #... (rest of the process variants)
}

frequency = {
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine"): 20385,
    ("Create Fine", "Payment"): 46371,
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty"): 9520,
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty", "Payment"): 3736,
    #... (rest of the process variants)
}

# Create a dictionary to store the temporal profile
temporal_profile = defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0])

# Populate the temporal profile
for variant in process_variants:
    avg = performance[tuple(variant)]
    stdev = (frequency[tuple(variant)]) ** 0.5
    temporal_profile[tuple(variant)][0] = avg
    temporal_profile[tuple(variant)][1] = stdev

# Print the temporal profile
for activity, avg_std in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"Activity: {activity}, AVG: {avg_std[0]}, STDEV: {avg_std[1]}")
```

This code first defines the process variants as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a sequence of activities. It then defines the performance and frequency of each process variant as separate dictionaries.

Next, it creates a dictionary called `temporal_profile` to store the temporal profile of the process. It populates this dictionary by iterating over the process variants and calculating the average and standard deviation of the performance for each variant.

Finally, it prints the temporal profile by iterating over the `temporal_profile` dictionary and printing the average and standard deviation for each activity.

Note that this code assumes that the performance values are normally distributed, which may not be the case in reality. You may need to adjust the code to account for non-normal distributions.

Also, this code does not take into account the fact that some process variants have different frequencies, which may affect the temporal profile. You may need to adjust the code to account for this as well.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
