The provided sequences and frequencies suggest a process related to e-commerce order handling and package delivery. Here's how the process could be described based on the data:

1. **Order Creation**: The customer initiates an order.
    - This is represented by the transition `"place order" -> "pay order"` with high frequency (655 events). Customers place orders, which need to be paid for.

2. **Payment Processing**:
   - Once placed, these orders move to a payment phase (`"pay order"`).
   
3. **Order Confirmation and Resubmission**:
    - After placing an order, some customers might repeat the action of placing another order or confirm the previous one (`"place order" -> "place order"` with 559 events).

4. **Package Creation**:
   - An internal action follows where a package is created to fulfill the order: `"create package" -> "send package"` (1,128 events). The package creation phase can happen after payment (`"pay order" -> "create package"` with 639 events) or directly from placing an order if there's a streamlined process.

5. **Shipping Process**:
    - Once the package is ready, it's sent out: `"send package" -> "package delivered"` (914 events).
    - Sometimes a confirmation step might be involved after sending packages (`"send package" -> "confirm order"`).

6. **Delivery and Confirmation**:
   - The delivery process involves moving from the `"send package"` state to the `"package delivered"` state.
   - Upon delivery, there's often another confirmation event: `"package delivered" -> "confirm order"` (604 events).
   
7. **Resubmission of Steps**: 
    - There are numerous occurrences where a step may be resubmitted or repeated such as:
        - Repeated confirmations (`"confirm order" -> "confirm order"`).
        - Resending packages (`"send package" -> "place order"`, `"place order" -> "send package"`).

8. **Internal Workflow**:
    - The process also includes internal steps like reprocessing the payment after creating a package or sending it again if something went wrong (`"create package" -> "pay order"`, `"send package" -> "pay order"`).

This sequence of events outlines an e-commerce and logistics workflow with multiple interactions and potential loops for repeated actions such as resubmitting orders, confirming steps, and dealing with different internal workflows (e.g., package creation and shipping).
