**1. Analysis of Both POWL Models in Relation to the Standard Hire-to-Retire Process:**

The standard **Hire-to-Retire** process typically follows a sequential flow of activities:

1. **Post Job Advertisement**
2. **Screen Candidates**
3. **Conduct Interviews**
4. **Make Hiring Decision**
5. **Onboard Employee**
6. **Add Employee to Payroll System**
7. **Close Case**

This sequence ensures that each step logically follows from the previous one, maintaining the integrity and correctness of the hiring process.

**POWL Model 1 Analysis:**

In **Model 1**, the defined activities and their ordering are as follows:

- **Post  Screen**
- **Screen  Decide**
- **Screen  Interview**
- **Decide  Onboard**
- **Onboard  Payroll**
- **Payroll  Close**

Notably, both **Interview** and **Decide** are directly connected to **Screen**, but there is **no direct ordering between them**. This means:

- After **Screen**, both **Interview** and **Decide** can occur in **any order or in parallel**.
- The model imposes **no requirement** for **Interviews** to occur before the **Hiring Decision** is made.

**POWL Model 2 Analysis:**

In **Model 2**, the structure introduces control-flow operators (loop and exclusive choice):

- **Post  Screen**
- **Post  Interview**
- **Interview  Decide**
- **Decide  loop_onboarding** (which is a loop between **Onboard** and a **silent skip** transition)
- **loop_onboarding  xor_payroll** (an exclusive choice between **Payroll** and **skip**)
- **xor_payroll  Close**

Key observations:

- After **Post**, both **Screen** and **Interview** can occur in **any order or in parallel**.
- **Screen** is **not connected** to any subsequent activity; its execution does not affect the rest of the process.
- The loop allows **Onboarding** to be **skipped or repeated multiple times**.
- The exclusive choice permits **Payroll** to be **skipped entirely**.

**2. Identification of Anomalies in Each Model:**

**Anomalies in Model 1:**

- **Disconnection between Interview and Decide:** The lack of ordering between **Interview** and **Decide** allows the hiring decision to be made **before conducting interviews**, which is illogical in a standard hiring process.
- **Concurrent Execution of Interview and Decide:** The possibility of these activities occurring in parallel undermines the logical dependency where interviews inform the hiring decision.

**Anomalies in Model 2:**

- **Screening Candidates Disconnected:** **Screen** is not sequenced before **Interview** or **Decide**, meaning candidates might be interviewed or a hiring decision made **without prior screening**.
- **Skipping Onboarding:** The loop with a **silent skip** allows the onboarding process to be **skipped entirely** or **repeated unnecessarily**, which could lead to employees not being properly integrated into the organization.
- **Skipping Payroll Addition:** The **exclusive choice** between **Payroll** and **skip** enables the process to conclude **without adding the new employee to the payroll system**, which is a critical administrative step.
- **Order of Screening and Interviewing:** Since both **Screen** and **Interview** emanate from **Post** with no ordering, the process allows for **interviewing to occur before screening**, or even **bypassing screening altogether**.

**3. Determination of the Model Closer to the Normative Process and Justification:**

**Model 1** more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire process. Here's why:

- **Presence of All Critical Steps:** All essential activities are present and connected in a sequence that mostly reflects the standard process (post, screen, decide, onboard, payroll addition, close case).
- **Single Anomaly:** The primary anomaly is the possibility of making the hiring decision before conducting interviews. While this is a significant deviation, it is **less severe** compared to the anomalies in Model 2.
- **Impact on Process Integrity:** Allowing the hiring decision before interviews compromises decision quality but does not inherently skip critical administrative steps necessary for onboarding a new employee into the organization.

**In contrast, Model 2** introduces multiple severe anomalies:

- **Skipping Critical Steps:** The model allows for **onboarding and payroll addition to be skipped**, which are crucial for integrating the employee and ensuring lawful employment practices.
- **Disconnection of Screening:** Permitting interviews and hiring decisions without screening candidates can lead to unqualified hires, violating standard recruitment protocols.
- **Repeating Onboarding Unnecessarily:** The loop can cause onboarding to occur multiple times, leading to operational inefficiencies.
- **Process Correctness and Integrity:** The anomalies in Model 2 fundamentally undermine the process's integrity by allowing the omission of steps essential for both compliance and the effective induction of new employees.

**Conclusion:**

Model 1 is closer to the standard Hire-to-Retire process despite its anomaly because it maintains the inclusion and necessary sequencing of critical activities post-hiring decision. The anomaly, while significant, affects the logical flow between interviews and the hiring decision but does not compromise the administrative and compliance aspects of the process. Conversely, Model 2's anomalies have broader implications, allowing for the omission of critical steps that could lead to legal issues and operational failures, thus deviating more substantially from the normative process.
