### **Anomalies in the DECLARE Model**

1. **Contradiction between `noncoexistence` and `precedence` rules**  
   The rule `noncoexistence` states that "E" (Evaluate) and "C" (Close) cannot coexist (`E` and `C` are mutually exclusive), with full confidence. However, the `precedence` rule asserts that "C" must follow "R" (Receive), which is logically valid.  
   The problem arises because the model allows a claim to be closed *without* evaluation — a direct violation of the intended process. If "E" and "C" are noncoexistent, then every claim that is closed must have been evaluated at some point. Yet, the model does not enforce this dependency, and the lack of a rule linking "E" to "C" allows for a claim to skip evaluation entirely and proceed to close. This creates a logical inconsistency: a claim can be closed without evaluation, which violates the intended workflow.

2. **Missing dependency between "A" (Assign) and "E" (Evaluate)**  
   The `responded_existence` rule states that "E" only occurs after "A" (Assign). While this seems reasonable, it does not guarantee that "E" actually happens. It only says that if "E" occurs, then "A" must have happened. There is no rule stating that "A" must be followed by "E", nor is there any enforcement that evaluation must happen *after* assignment. This creates a gap in the process: a claim could be assigned to an adjuster and then never evaluated — meaning the "E" step is optional or skipped, undermining the integrity of the claim review process.

3. **Absence of a rule ensuring "P" (Approve) precedes "N" (Notify)**  
   The model does not include any constraint linking approval to notification. In the ideal process, approval must occur before notifying the customer. Without such a rule, a claim could be closed or notified before being approved, which breaks the business logic and could result in unauthorized customer communication.

4. **Ambiguous or missing rule for "R" to "A" transition**  
   While "R" is allowed to initiate the process, there is no rule stating that assignment ("A") must follow receipt ("R"). This allows for a claim to be received and then closed immediately — skipping the assignment phase. This is a serious deviation from the intended process flow and violates the requirement that claims must be assigned to an adjuster before being evaluated.

### **Hypotheses for the Anomalies**

1. **Misinterpretation of business requirements**  
   The model may have been constructed based on incomplete or misinterpreted process documentation. For instance, the team might have assumed that "evaluation" was optional or that "close" could occur without evaluation, leading to the noncoexistence rule being incorrectly applied.

2. **Incremental policy changes without model alignment**  
   A change in policy — such as allowing expedited claims or enabling automated closure — may have been introduced without updating the DECLARE model. This could explain why the "C" step appears without "E", or why "E" is not required before "C".

3. **Technical or data collection limitations**  
   The system may not have captured the "Evaluate" step consistently. For example, if evaluation was automated or skipped in certain cases due to technical glitches, the model may reflect what was observed in the data rather than the intended process. This could lead to the false appearance of "E" and "C" coexisting or being absent.

4. **Pressure to reduce processing time**  
   To meet operational targets, there may have been a push to streamline the process by skipping evaluation or allowing early closure. This could result in constraints being weakened or omitted to enable faster claim resolution, even at the cost of process integrity.

### **Verification Approaches via SQL Queries**

1. **Find claims closed without evaluation**  
   This checks if the noncoexistence rule between "E" and "C" is violated.  
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, c.claim_type
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
     AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 
       FROM claim_events ce2 
       WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id 
         AND ce2.activity = 'E'
     );
   ```

2. **Find claims where evaluation and closing coexist**  
   This verifies the contradiction in the `noncoexistence` rule.  
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, c.claim_type
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' 
     AND ce2.activity = 'C'
     AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp;
   ```

3. **Find claims assigned without evaluation**  
   This checks whether the "responded_existence" rule is being violated.  
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, c.claim_type
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE ce.activity = 'A'
     AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 
       FROM claim_events ce2 
       WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id 
         AND ce2.activity = 'E'
     );
   ```

4. **Find claims with approval before notification**  
   This checks if the "P"  "N" dependency is missing.  
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, c.claim_type
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' 
     AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND ce1.timestamp > ce2.timestamp;
   ```

5. **Find claims received and closed without assignment**  
   This verifies the missing "R"  "A" dependency.  
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, c.claim_type
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
     AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 
       FROM claim_events ce2 
       WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id 
         AND ce2.activity = 'A'
     );
   ```

These queries provide a data-driven validation of the model’s assumptions and expose real-world deviations from the intended process. They can be used to validate whether the constraints in the DECLARE model accurately reflect operational reality.
