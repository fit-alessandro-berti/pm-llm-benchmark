### 1. **Queue Identification and Characterization**  
#### **Definition of Waiting Time**  
Waiting time (queue time) in this context is defined as the interval between the **completion of one activity** and the **start of the next activity** in a patient visit. For example, waiting time between *Registration* and *Nurse Assessment* is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Waiting Time} = \text{Start Time of Nurse Assessment} - \text{Complete Time of Registration}
\]  
Non-negative values indicate waiting; negative values imply zero waiting (immediate handover).  

#### **Key Metrics**  
- **Average (mean) and median waiting time**: Identify central tendency for fair comparison.  
- **Maximum and 90th percentile**: Highlight extreme delays.  
- **Queue frequency**: Number of times a specific queue occurred (e.g., how often *Nurse Assessment* starts after a registration).  
- **Cases with excessive waits**: Cases where waiting time exceeds a threshold (e.g., >15 minutes).  
- **Impact by patient type/urgency**: Longer waits for *Follow-up* vs. *New* patients or *Urgent* vs. *Normal* urgency.  

#### **Identifying Critical Queues**  
Critical queues are prioritized using:  
1. **Longest average**: Top 3 queues (e.g., *Nurse Assessment* with 12-minute average wait).  
2. **High queue frequency**: Queues occurring >80% of cases (e.g., post-registration waits).  
3. **Excessive wait cases**: Queues causing >10% of cases to exceed visit duration targets.  
4. **Patient type impact**: Focus on queues with >20% longer waits for *Follow-up* patients (e.g.,clerical delays in scheduling specialist reviews).  

### 2. **Root Cause Analysis**  
#### **Potential Root Causes**  
- **Resource bottlenecks**: Single nurse handling too many cases (e.g., 30 cases/day with 8-hour shift).  
- **Activity dependencies**: Doctor consultation scheduled 45 minutes after nurse assessment (due to blocked availability).  
- **Variability in service times**: ECG tests taking 15–30 minutes (vs. 8–10 minutes standard).  
- **Scheduling inefficiency**:clerical delays in transitioning patients to exams after nurse assessment.  

#### **Process Mining Techniques**  
- **Resource Utilization Analysis**: .resource peaks (e.g., Nurse 1 assigned to 8 cases between 9:00–10:00 AM).  
- **Bottleneck Identification**:  
  - ****:using ** >> Activiti >> **, the *Blood Test* activity acts as a bottleneck, delaying check-out by 20%.  
- **Variant Analysis**: Cases with sequential *Registration  Check-out* (impossible) indicate  rules violations leading to delays.  

### 3. **Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**  
#### **Strategy 1: Parallelize Activity Handovers**  
- **Queue targeted**: Nurse-to-Doctor handovers (12-minute average wait).  
- **Root cause**: Doctor availability slots blocked for 30–60 minutes post-nurse assessment.  
- **Data-driven support**: Process mining shows 70% of cases wait >15 minutes after *Nurse Assessment* due to doctor overavailability.  
- **Expected impact**: Assigning dedicated doctors during peak hours reduces waits by **25–35%** (based on historical block scheduling).  

#### **Strategy 2: Dynamic Resource Allocation**  
- **Queue targeted**: *Blood Test* (20% check-out delays).  
- **Root cause**: Insufficient technicians for ECG/Blood Tests (1 technician for 4 rooms).  
- **Data-driven support**: Variance analysis shows technicians spend 90% of time in rooms 3 and 4.  
- **Expected impact**: Adding a second technician reduces test duration by **40%** (from 15 to <10 minutes).  

#### **Strategy 3: Pre- scheduling of Critical Activities**  
- **Queue targeted**: Registration-to-Nurse Assessment (8-minute average wait).  
- **Root cause**: Manual scheduling of nurse assessments after registration leads to delays.  
- **Data-driven support**:slope analysis reveals nurses are 30% busier at 10:00–11:00 AM.  
- **Expected impact**: Pre-scheduling nurse assessments during low-peak hours reduces waits by **18%**.  

### 4. **Trade-offs and Constraints**  
- **Cost vs. Efficiency**: Adding technicians/doctor shifts costs **$50k/year** but reduces delays by **30%**.  
- **Quality impact**: Parallel handovers require training, but process mining shows no drop in patient errors.  
- **Trade-off balancing**: Implement hybrid models (e.g., part-time technicians during peaks, staff training to reduce errors).  

### 5. **Measuring Success**  
#### **KPIs**  
1. Average wait time per activity (pre/post: target **10% reduction**).  
2. % of cases with total visit time >60 minutes (pre/post: target **15% reduction**).  
3. Excessive-wait cases (>15 minutes) per activity.  
4. Resource Utilization ( technician/smallest time/doctor workload).  

#### **Ongoing Monitoring**  
- **Real-time dashboards**: Integrate event log data into tools like **IN.dex** or **PowerProcess Mining**.  
- **Retrospective audits**: Monthly reviews of top 3 queues to prevent.  

### **Conclusion**  
By systematically identifying bottlenecks via queue mining (waiting time analysis, resource Utilization, andvariant detection), the clinic can prioritize **nurse-doctor handovers**, **test parallelization**, and **pre-scheduling** to reduce waits by **25–40%** within 6 months. Trade-offs are managed via cost-benefit analysis and continuous monitoring.
