Of the two logs, **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias**.

The bias manifests through the systematic adjustment of scores based on membership in a specific `CommunityGroup`, which is exclusively available to applicants who are also `LocalResident`.

### How the Bias Manifests:

1. **Differential Treatment Based on Community Group Membership:**
   - In **Group B**, applicants who are members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a **+10 point "Community Boost"** during the `PreliminaryScoring` activity.
   - This is evident in cases **U001** and **U003**, where their scores are increased from 720 to 730 and from 695 to 705, respectively.
   - In contrast, **Group A** applicants receive **no score adjustments** (all `ScoreAdjustment` values are 0).

2. **Interaction with Protected Attributes:**
   - The `CommunityGroup` benefit is only applied to `LocalResident = TRUE` applicants (all Group B members).
   - Since `LocalResident` status can be a proxy for other protected characteristics (like race or socioeconomic status in certain geographic areas), this creates a potential for **indirect discrimination**.
   - The system effectively creates two different scoring standards: one for local community members and another for non-locals.

3. **Impact on Final Decisions:**
   - The score adjustments directly influence outcomes. For example:
     - **U003** (Group B) started with a preliminary score of 695, which would likely have been rejected without the boost. After the +10 adjustment to 705, the application was approved.
     - Meanwhile, **P002** (Group A) with a higher preliminary score of 710 was rejected, demonstrating that Group A applicants face a stricter standard.

4. **Systematic Advantage:**
   - The bias is systematic because it's formally embedded in the scoring process through the "Community Boost" mechanism.
   - This creates a predictable advantage for certain applicants based on their community affiliations and local residency status.

### Conclusion:

The bias in Group B creates an unlevel playing field where applicants from the preferred community group receive preferential treatment through automatic score enhancements. This systematic advantage based on community membership and local residency constitutes a form of institutional bias that could lead to discrimination against protected groups who may be less likely to belong to these specific community organizations or meet the local residency requirement.
