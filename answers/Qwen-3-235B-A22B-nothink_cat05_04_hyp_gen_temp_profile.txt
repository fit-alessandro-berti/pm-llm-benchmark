### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Short and Tight Time Between "Receive" and "Approve" (R  P)**  
   - **Average Time:** ~25 hours  
   - **Standard Deviation:** Only 1 hour  
   - **Observation:** A very consistent and short duration between claim submission and approval suggests potential automation or bypassing of required steps like evaluation or adjuster assignment.

2. **Long and Variable Time Between "Approve" and "Notify" (P  N)**  
   - **Average Time:** 7 days  
   - **Standard Deviation:** 2 days  
   - **Observation:** A long average with high variability indicates inconsistency in the notification process after approval, possibly due to bottlenecks, manual handling, or system delays.

3. **Unusually Fast Closure After Assign (A  C)**  
   - **Average Time:** 2 hours  
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour  
   - **Observation:** Claims being closed so quickly after assignment, without passing through required steps like evaluation and approval, may indicate premature or incorrect closure.

4. **Very Rapid Transition from Evaluate to Notify (E  N)**  
   - **Average Time:** 5 minutes  
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute  
   - **Observation:** Such a short and consistent time between evaluation and notification may indicate automation or skipping of necessary internal steps.

### Hypotheses on the Causes of These Anomalies

1. **R  P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** Some claims might be auto-approved without proper evaluation, possibly due to low claim amounts or specific claim types being fast-tracked.  
   - **Possible Cause:** Automated rules in the system or misconfigured workflows.

2. **P  N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** Approval notifications are either batched, manually handled by overburdened staff, or delayed due to system integration issues.  
   - **Possible Cause:** Manual processing steps, lack of automation, or delayed system triggers.

3. **A  C (Assign to Close):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** Some claims might be closed prematurely without going through evaluation or approval, possibly due to human error or system bugs.  
   - **Possible Cause:** Adjusters may be closing claims without completing required steps.

4. **E  N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** Evaluation and notification steps may be merged in the system, or the notification is triggered automatically without delay after evaluation.  
   - **Possible Cause:** Over-automation or missing internal review steps.

### Proposed SQL Verification Queries

#### 1. **Claims Approved Immediately After Submission (R  P)**

```sql
WITH receive_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS r_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'R'
),
approve_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS p_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    r.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.p_time - r.r_time)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM receive_events r
JOIN approve_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.p_time - r.r_time)) BETWEEN 86400 AND 90000  -- Between 1 and 25 hours
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds;
```

#### 2. **Claims with Long Delays Between Approval and Notification (P  N)**

```sql
WITH approve_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS p_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
),
notify_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS n_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    p.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.n_time - p.p_time)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM approve_events p
JOIN notify_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.n_time - p.p_time)) > 604800  -- Longer than 7 days
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds DESC;
```

#### 3. **Claims Closed Immediately After Assign (A  C)**

```sql
WITH assign_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS a_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'A'
),
close_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS c_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'C'
)
SELECT 
    a.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.c_time - a.a_time)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM assign_events a
JOIN close_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.c_time - a.a_time)) < 7200  -- Less than 2 hours
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds;
```

#### 4. **Claims Evaluated and Notified in Under 10 Minutes (E  N)**

```sql
WITH evaluate_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS e_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'E'
),
notify_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS n_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    e.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.n_time - e.e_time)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM evaluate_events e
JOIN notify_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.n_time - e.e_time)) < 600  -- Less than 10 minutes
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds;
```

#### 5. **Correlation Between Adjusters and Premature Closures (A  C)**

```sql
WITH assign_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS a_time, resource
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'A'
),
close_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS c_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'C'
)
SELECT 
    a.resource AS adjuster,
    COUNT(*) AS premature_closures
FROM assign_events a
JOIN close_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.c_time - a.a_time)) < 7200
GROUP BY a.resource
ORDER BY premature_closures DESC;
```

#### 6. **Correlation Between Claim Type and Long Approval-to-Notification Delays (P  N)**

```sql
WITH approve_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS p_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
),
notify_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS n_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(*) AS long_delay_count
FROM approve_events p
JOIN notify_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.n_time - p.p_time)) > 604800
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY long_delay_count DESC;
```

These queries can help pinpoint specific instances of anomalies, correlate them with adjusters, claim types, or other factors, and support root cause analysis or process optimization efforts.
