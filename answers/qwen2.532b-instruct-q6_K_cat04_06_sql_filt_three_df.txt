To achieve this task in DuckDB, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify sequences of activities for each `case_id`.
2. Filter only those sequences where 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' appear consecutively.
3. Calculate the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.
4. Exclude cases with a sequence that meets both the order condition and the timing requirement (> 5 days).
5. Retrieve all events from `event_log` excluding those from filtered cases.

Here's how you can write this in SQL:

```sql
WITH Sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        e1.case_id,
        e1.activity AS act1,
        e2.activity AS act2,
        e3.activity AS act3,
        e1.timestamp AS ts1,
        e2.timestamp AS ts2,
        e3.timestamp AS ts3
    FROM 
        event_log e1
        JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp
        JOIN event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e2.timestamp < e3.timestamp
    WHERE 
        e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
FilteredCases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM Sequences
    WHERE ts3 - ts2 > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM FilteredCases);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sequences CTE**: This common table expression identifies consecutive sequences of the three specific activities within each `case_id`. It joins `event_log` with itself twice to ensure that 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed directly by 'Create Order', and this in turn is followed by 'Confirm Order'.

2. **FilteredCases CTE**: From the identified sequences, it selects those cases where the time difference between 'Create Order' (`ts2`) and 'Confirm Order' (`ts3`) exceeds 5 days.

3. **Final SELECT Statement**: It retrieves all rows from `event_log` except for those that belong to cases found in `FilteredCases`.

This SQL script ensures you get all events, excluding the ones from cases where the specified activity sequence occurs with a time gap of more than 5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.
