Based on the given event log and the observed behavior, we can construct a process tree that balances fitness, precision, and simplicity. Here's the final structure of the process tree:

```plaintext
+ (
    -> (
        'Receive Application (RA)',
        * (
            -> (
                'Validate Form (VF)',
                * (
                    -> (
                        'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
                        -> (
                            'Validate Form (VF)',
                            tau  // A silent step to indicate the loop can exit here
                        )
                    )
                )
            ),
            'Assess Eligibility (AE)'
        ),
        'Approval Decision (AD)',
        'Send Confirmation (SC)',
        'Archive Case (AC)'
    )
)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Root Node (Parallel)**: The root node is a parallel operator indicating true concurrency. This is necessary because the main sequence of activities is the primary flow, but there can be concurrent handling of missing information requests.

2. **Main Sequence (Sequence)**:
    - `Receive Application (RA)`: The process starts with receiving the application.
    - A loop (`*`) operator follows to handle the validation and potential requests for missing information:
        - Inside the loop, `Validate Form (VF)` is executed.
        - Another loop (`*`) captures the repetition of requesting missing information and re-validation:
            - `Request Missing Info (RMI)`
            - `Validate Form (VF)`
            - A silent step (`tau`) to indicate that the loop can exit after re-validation.
        - After exiting the inner loop, `Assess Eligibility (AE)` is executed.
    - After the loop, the sequence continues with `Approval Decision (AD)`, followed by `Send Confirmation (SC)`, and finally `Archive Case (AC)`.

This structure captures the main flow of activities while also accommodating the repetitive behavior of requesting missing information and re-validation. It balances fitness, precision, and simplicity by clearly defining the main sequence and the optional repetitive steps.
