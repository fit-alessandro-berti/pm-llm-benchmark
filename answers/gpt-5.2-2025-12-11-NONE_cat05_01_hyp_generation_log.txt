You are an analyst reviewing an order-to-cash event log in PostgreSQL. The expected (“happy path”) sequence per order (`case_id`) is:

1) Register Order  2) Perform Credit Check  3) Validate Stock  4) Confirm Shipment  5) Ship Goods  6) Issue Invoice  7) Receive Payment

Your task:

1. **Detect and describe anomalies / undesirable behaviors** present in the event data. Focus on issues like out-of-order steps, missing steps, duplicated steps, suspicious timing, and role/department mismatches.
2. **Hypothesize plausible root causes** (system/workflow design issues, user training gaps, policy violations, integrations, manual overrides, fraud, etc.).
3. **Propose SQL queries** (PostgreSQL) you would run against:
   - `order_event_log(case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp, resource, additional_info)`
   - `orders(case_id, customer_id, order_type, order_value)`
   - `resources(resource_id, role, department)`
   
   to validate your hypotheses. Do **not** assume you are given any anomaly hints; your queries should stand on their own and help discover issues from the data.

Constraints/guidance:
- Treat `timestamp` as the main ordering within a case (do not rely on `event_id` ordering unless you explicitly test that assumption).
- Include queries that (a) surface **out-of-sequence transitions**, (b) detect **missing mandatory activities**, (c) find **payment-before-invoice or shipment-before-credit/stock**, (d) check **department segregation-of-duties** violations via `resources`, and (e) identify **unusually fast/slow cycle times** between key steps.
- Where useful, include joins to `orders` to see if anomalies correlate with `order_type` or `order_value`.
- Output: Provide (i) a list of anomaly types you would look for, (ii) hypotheses, and (iii) the SQL queries to investigate each.
