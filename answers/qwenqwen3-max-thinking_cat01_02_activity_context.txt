### Analysis and Renaming of Recurring Activities

In the provided event log, two activity names recur **within the same case** and carry **different contextual meanings** depending on their position and surrounding events:

1. **"Verify Documents"** appears **twice in every case**:
   - **First occurrence**: Initial verification attempt (often incomplete due to missing documents or discrepancies).
   - **Second occurrence**: Re-verification **after** the customer has submitted additional documents or after internal adjustments have been made.

2. **"Call Customer"** appears **twice in Cases C002 and C003**:
   - **First occurrence**: Typically to **request missing information** or **clarify discrepancies**.
   - **Second occurrence**: A **follow-up** call to **confirm resolution** or **request the customer’s return** (e.g., after they stepped out).

These contextual differences are evident from the **"Additional Context"** column and the **sequence of events**:
- In C001: First "Call Customer" is to request missing docs; no second call.
- In C002: First call clarifies discrepancy; second confirms adjustments.
- In C003: First call asks customer to return; no second verification-related call, but the pattern of "Verify Documents" still holds.

Thus, we will rename:
- **"Verify Documents"**   
  - **"Verify Documents – Initial"** for the first occurrence  
  - **"Verify Documents – Final"** for the second occurrence  

- **"Call Customer"**   
  - **"Call Customer – Request Info"** for calls seeking missing data or clarification  
  - **"Call Customer – Confirm/Recall"** for follow-up or recall calls  

> **Note**: In C001, there's only one "Call Customer", which matches the "Request Info" pattern. In C002 and C003, the first call is "Request Info", and the second is "Confirm/Recall".

### Justification of Renaming Choices

1. **"Verify Documents – Initial" vs. "Verify Documents – Final"**  
   - The **first verification** consistently occurs right after request initiation and often fails or is incomplete (as seen in C001 needing more docs, C002 having a discrepancy, C003 missing info).  
   - The **second verification** always follows a corrective action (document upload or account adjustment) and precedes final approval, indicating it is the conclusive validation step.  
    Hence, "Initial" and "Final" accurately reflect their roles in the verification lifecycle.

2. **"Call Customer – Request Info" vs. "Call Customer – Confirm/Recall"**  
   - The **first call** in C002 seeks clarification; in C001, it requests missing documents—both are **information-gathering** actions.  
   - The **second call** in C002 confirms a resolution; in C003, it recalls a customer who left—both are **resolution-oriented or logistical follow-ups**.  
    "Request Info" captures the purpose of the first call; "Confirm/Recall" covers both confirmation and physical recall scenarios in a single, clear label.

These renamed activities now unambiguously reflect **when** and **why** they occur, improving process transparency for analysis, automation, or auditing.
