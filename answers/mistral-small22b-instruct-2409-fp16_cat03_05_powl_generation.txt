 Certainly! Below is a Python code example that constructs a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. This process typically involves activities like ordering, receiving the order, checking the order, and finally paying for it.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities of the P2P process
order = Transition(label="Order")
receive_order = Transition(label="Receive Order")
check_order = Transition(label="Check Order")
pay_invoice = Transition(label="Pay Invoice")
archive_invoice = SilentTransition()  # This activity does not need a label in the log

# Create a loop for checking the order until it's correct
check_order_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[check_order])

# Create an exclusive choice between archiving the invoice or paying it after receiving the order and check
receive_check_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[pay_invoice, archive_invoice])

# Add the order of execution: order -> receive order -> loop to check order until correct -> pay or archive invoice
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[order, receive_order, receive_check_xor, check_order_loop])
root.order.add_edge(order, receive_order)
root.order.add_edge(receive_order, check_order_loop)
root.order.add_edge(check_order_loop, receive_check_xor)

# Display the constructed POWL model (if pm4py has a way to display models, you can use it here)
print(pm4py.objects.powl.obj.convert.to_dot(root))
```

This code sets up a simple P2P process:
1. **Order** - The initial activity where an order is placed.
2. **Receive Order** - Activity where the order is received.
3. **Loop to Check Order** - This loop continues until the order is checked correctly.
4. **Pay Invoice/Archive Invoice** - An exclusive choice between paying the invoice or archiving it without paying.
