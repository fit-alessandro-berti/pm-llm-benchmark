**Bias is exhibited in Group B’s log (Unprotected Group), via preferential treatment tied to `LocalResident=TRUE` and `CommunityGroup` membership that produces systematic score boosts and, consequently, more approvals at lower underlying (pre-adjustment) creditworthiness.** This creates a disparity relative to Group A (Protected Group), who never receive comparable adjustments.

## What differs between the logs

### 1) `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` are correlated with group membership
- **Group A:** `LocalResident = FALSE` for all cases; `CommunityGroup = None` for all cases.
- **Group B:** `LocalResident = TRUE` for all cases; some have `CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club`.

This sets up an eligibility channel where only Group B can plausibly qualify for a “community” benefit.

### 2) `ScoreAdjustment` is applied only in Group B and only when a community group is present
- **Group A:** `ScoreAdjustment = 0` everywhere (no boosts at all).
- **Group B:** For U001 and U003, `ScoreAdjustment = +10 (Community Boost)`, raising the effective score used later.

So the process explicitly transforms the same type of input score into a higher “Adjusted” score—but only for a subset of Group B.

## How the bias manifests in outcomes

### Preferential approvals at lower baseline scores
Compare similar preliminary scores and decisions:

- **P002 (Group A):** PreliminaryScore **710**, **Rejected**, no adjustment available.
- **U002 (Group B):** PreliminaryScore **710**, **Rejected**, adjustment 0  consistent.

But the bias appears when community boost is available:

- **U003 (Group B):** PreliminaryScore **695**, gets **+10**  Adjusted **705**, **Approved**.
  - In Group A, there is **no mechanism** that could lift a 695-equivalent case, because adjustments never occur.
  - That means some Group B applicants can be approved **despite weaker initial scores**, solely due to a group-linked boost.

### The mechanism is structurally one-sided
Even if Group A had applicants with identical financial profiles to U001/U003, the log indicates they **cannot** receive the +10 because:
- They are not local residents (always FALSE here), and
- They have no community group membership recorded (always None here).

This is a classic form of **systemic/process bias**: a policy feature (community boost) is not equally accessible across groups, so it creates consistent advantage for one group.

## Why this is bias (in fairness terms)
- The “Community Boost” is effectively a **non-credit** factor that improves approval chances.
- Because `LocalResident`/`CommunityGroup` are unevenly distributed between protected vs. unprotected logs, the boost operates as a **proxy advantage** for the unprotected group.
- Result: **different decision thresholds in practice** (Group B can be approved at lower preliminary scores than Group A), leading to **disparate impact**.

## Bottom line
- **Biased log:** **Group B**, because it contains a systematic, favorable score adjustment mechanism unavailable in Group A.
- **Manifestation:** `LocalResident=TRUE` and membership in `Highland Civic Darts Club` trigger a **+10 score uplift**, increasing approvals for Group B and enabling approvals at lower initial scores, producing systematic differences in final decisions.
