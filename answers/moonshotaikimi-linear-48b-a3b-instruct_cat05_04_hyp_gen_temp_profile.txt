## Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

### 1. **R to P (Receive to Approve) - Suspicious Low Variability**
**Anomaly**: Average of 25 hours with only 1-hour standard deviation (0.4% of mean)
**Implications**:
- Process may be artificially accelerated, skipping evaluation stages
- Possible automation without proper validation steps
- Single adjuster or system handling all approvals without proper review

### 2. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify) - Unusually Rapid**
**Anomaly**: Average of 5 minutes with 1-minute standard deviation
**Implications**:
- Likely skipping of actual evaluation work
- Automated notifications based on timestamps rather than analysis
- Possible compliance violations by not documenting evaluation process

### 3. **A to C (Assign to Close) - Premature Closure Risk**
**Anomaly**: Only 2 hours average with 1-hour variation
**Implications**:
- Claims may be closed without proper investigation
- Reduce cycle time by avoiding evaluation/approval steps
- Could indicate capacity issues forcing premature closures

### 4. **P to N (Approve to Notify) - Extreme Variability**
**Anomaly**: Average 7 days with 2-day standard deviation
**Implications**:
- No queue management or SLA commitments for customer notification
- Exceptions indicate poor process control
- Resource allocation problems during notification phase

## Hypotheses for Anomaly Explanations

### Hypothesis 1: Automated Screening Bypass
**R to P behavior suggests** claims might be auto-approved based on dollar thresholds or customer risk profiles, completely bypassing evaluation steps.

### Hypothesis 2: Resource Overload Continuum
**P to N variance indicates** multiple channels handling notifications with varying SLAs:
- Some adjusters maintain promised 2-day SLAs
- Others let claims stagnate for weeks, causing backlogs
- No centralized queue management system exists

### Hypothesis 3: Process Gaming
**A to C acceleration implies** adjusters close claims early to meet productivity metrics, potentially violating policy terms by skipping proper investigation.

### Hypothesis 4: System Integration Issues
**E to N quickness suggests** evaluation and notification systems are directly integrated, allowing claims to be marked evaluated while actually just being staged for automated notification.

## Verification SQL Queries

### Query 1: Identify R to P Violations
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    MIN(ce1.timestamp) as receive_time,
    MIN(ce2.timestamp) as assign_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp))) / 3600 as hours_between
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
    INNER JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
        AND ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'A'
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 < 12
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY c.claim_id) = 1;
```

### Query 2: Find Premature Closures
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('day', c.submission_date) as submission_date,
    MIN(ce.timestamp) as earliest_event,
    CASE 
        WHEN MIN(ce.activity) = 'R' THEN 'Shortest Path - No Evaluation'
        WHEN MIN(ce.activity) = 'A' THEN 'Premature Close'
        ELSE 'Normal Path'
    END as closure_pattern
FROM 
    claim_events ce
    INNER JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce.activity IN ('A', 'C')
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id, c.customer_id, DATE_TRUNC('day', c.submission_date)
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) = 2
ORDER BY 
    earliest_event;
```

### Query 3: Examine P to N Delays by Resource
```sql
SELECT 
    a.name as adjuster_name,
    a.region,
    ce1.activity,
    ce2.activity,
    date_part('days', ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) as days_delay,
    CASE 
        WHEN date_part('days', ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) < 2 THEN 'Quick'
        WHEN date_part('days', ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) > 10 THEN 'Exceptional Delay'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END as delay_category
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
    INNER JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    INNER JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id OR ce2.resource = a.adjuster_id

    ce1.activity = 'P' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND a.specialization = 'home'
ORDER BY 
    days_delay DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Query 4: Track Claims with No Evaluation Records
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    COUNT(ce.activity) as total_events,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) = 0 THEN 'No Evaluation Conducted'
        ELSE 'Has Evaluation Records'
    END as evaluation_status
FROM 
    claims c
    LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE 
    c.claim_type = 'auto_insurance'
    AND DATE(c.submission_date) >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
HAVING 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN 1 END) > 0;
