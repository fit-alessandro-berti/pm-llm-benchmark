First, I'll determine the unique process instances. The `order_id` is the clear case identifier, so each order will be its own case.

Next, I'll identify the activities. The available tables give us:
- **Order Created** - from the `Orders` table, using `order_date`.
- **Items Picked** - from the `Order Lines` table, using `item_picking_date`.
- **Order Dispatched** - from the `Delivery` table, using `delivery_dispatch_date`.
- **Order Arrived** - from the `Delivery` table, using `delivery_arrival_date`.
- **Invoice Issued** - from the `Invoice` table, using `invoice_issue_date`.
- **Payment Received** - from the `Payments` table, using `payment_date`.

For each activity, I'll use the resource if available:
- Sales Person for order creation.
- Picker for items picked.
- Carrier for dispatch and arrival.
- Billing person for invoice.
- No resource is provided for payments, so I'll leave it blank.

I'll ensure all events are in chronological order for each case. If an order has multiple line items, each item picking event will be a separate row, as they have distinct timestamps and resources.

I'll now construct the event log, including all events for each order in order of occurrence.
