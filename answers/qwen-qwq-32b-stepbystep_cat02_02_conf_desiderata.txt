Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a scenario with three cases (1, 2, 3) and wants us to check which ones violate the strict rules (normative) and which just break the best practices (desiderata). 

First, I need to recall the normative constraints. The key points here are the sequence must be followed exactly. Let me note them again:

The correct sequence is:
Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Then, if approved, do Finalize Docs before closing. If rejected, close without docs.

Also, the ordering rules are Credit Check before Risk, Risk before Decision, Inform after Decision, and Finalize only if approved, and only then before closing. 

Now, looking at Case 2 first because the example already points out some issues. Let me go through each case one by one.

Starting with Case 1. The activities are in order:

Application at 9:00, then Credit Check at 9:30, Risk at 10:00, Decision (approved) at 11, Inform at 13:00, then Finalize Docs at 13:30, Close at 14:00. 

Does this follow all the strict rules? The sequence looks correct. Credit Check before Risk, Risk before Decision, Inform after Decision. Since it's approved, Finalize is done before closing. So Case 1 seems okay.

Case 2 starts with Application at 8:00, then the next step is Risk Assessment at 8:20 but before the Credit Check. That's a problem because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. So that's a normative violation. 

Next, after the Loan Decision (Rejected), they did Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed. Because if rejected, you shouldn't finalize docs. So that's another normative violation. 

So Case 2 has two normative issues: wrong order (Risk before Credit Check), and Finalize after Rejection.

Case 3: The first issue is Credit Check happening 2 days later (Application on Jan 12, Credit Check on Jan 14). The desiderata says Credit Check should be within 24 hours, so that's a desideratum violation, not a normative one. 

Then, the Inform Applicant is on the 16th, which is more than 48 hours after the Decision (Decision was on the 14th at 12:00, so 48 hours would be up to Jan 16 12:00. The Inform is at 15:00 on the 16th, which is 2 days and 3 hours, so just over. But the desiderata says within 48 hours, so that's another desideratum issue. 

Also, there's no Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum. 

Now, are there any normative violations in Case 3? Let's check the sequence. The steps are in the correct order: Application  Credit Check  Risk  Decision  Inform  Finalize  Close. Since it was approved, they did Finalize before closing, so that's okay. So no normative violations here, just the desiderata.

Now, the second part is the desiderata. Case 1 didn't have any desiderata issues mentioned. Let's check again. 

Case1: Credit Check was done 30 minutes after Application, which is within 24 hours. Then, Inform Applicant was at 13:00, Decision at 11:00. The time between Decision and Inform is 2 hours, well under 48. So they followed the timing recommendations. Also, there's no mention of a Follow-up Call in the log for Case1, so that's a desideratum issue too? Wait, the log for Case1 doesn't list a Follow-up Call. The example in the problem mentions that a Follow-up Call is a desideratum but optional. The user's log for Case3 notes that there was no Follow-up Call, but in the table, for Case1, the activities listed don't include a Follow-up Call either. Wait, but the problem's example specifically mentions that for Case3 there's no Follow-up, but the user's table for Case1 doesn't mention it. Wait the user's log table for Case1's last activity is Close Case, no Follow-up mentioned. So perhaps in all cases, the Follow-up is missing unless explicitly listed. So, in Case1, they didn't do a Follow-up Call either, which is a desideratum issue, but maybe the problem expects us to note that. Wait, looking at the problem's desiderata says: "it is encouraged to perform a Follow-up Call before closing." The example in the log for Case3 has no Follow-up, so that's a desideratum. But for Case1, the log doesn't have it either. So maybe all three cases might have that missing? Let me check the logs again.

Looking at the table:

Case1: The activities are up to Close Case without any Follow-up. So yes, that's a desideratum violation (since they didn't do it, but it's just a recommendation). So all three cases might have that, unless there's an entry. Wait, looking at the table's entries:

Case1's log has no Follow-up. Similarly, Case2 also has no Follow-up. The problem's example in the log for Case2's entries don't mention it. So all three cases may have missed the Follow-up, but the user's log for Case3 specifically mentions it in the note. Wait, looking at the user's table, for case3's line, there's a note in the last row: "| 3       | *(No Follow-up Call)* |". So they explicitly noted that in the table. But for the other cases, the tables don't have that note, so maybe in their logs, the Follow-up was not done. But maybe the problem is only pointing out for Case3. Wait, the user's table for Case3 has a row with the note, but the other cases don't. Hmm, maybe the Follow-up is only missing in Case3? Wait, the problem description says "encouraged to perform a Follow-up Call sometime before closing the case". So any case that doesn't have it is violating the desiderata. But in the log tables, except for Case3's note, the other cases don't have a Follow-up entry, but maybe they just didn't log it? Or perhaps the table only includes the steps they actually did. Since the problem says "the event log" lists all the activities, so if it's not listed, they didn't do it. Therefore, all three cases might have the missing Follow-up. But the user's note in the table for Case3's last line says "(No Follow-up Call)", implying that the other cases might have followed, but according to the table, the other cases don't have that note. Wait, the user's table for Case2 doesn't have a note, so maybe in Case2 they did do a Follow-up? But according to the table's entries, the activities listed for Case2 are up to Close Case without a Follow-up. So perhaps all three cases have a missing Follow-up, but the user only points it out for Case3. Hmm, maybe the problem's example in Case3's note is just an example, but according to the log entries, each case's log shows no Follow-up. So I should check all cases for that. But given the way the user presented the logs, I need to go by what's written. 

Wait, the task is to analyze the given log. Let me recheck each case's activities:

Case1's log entries do not have a Follow-up Call, so that's a desiderata violation (since it's a recommended step). Similarly, Case2's log also has no such entry, so that's another desideratum. Case3 also didn't have it, as per the note in the table. 

But the problem mentions "the event log (tabular format)" provided. So according to the table:

Case2's log entries are up to Close Case, so they didn't do Follow-up. Case1's log also ends with Close, so they didn't do Follow-up either. So all three cases failed to do the Follow-up, which is a desideratum. But maybe the Follow-up can be done at any point before closing, so even if they didn't do it, that's a desideratum. 

Now for normative violations:

Case1 is okay. 

Case2 has two normative issues: 

- Risk Assessment before Credit Check (the second entry is Risk at 8:20, then Credit Check at 9:00. That's out of order. 

- Then, after rejecting, they did Finalize Documentation before closing, which is not allowed. So two violations here. 

Case3 has no normative issues. 

Now for desiderata:

Case1: Did they do the Credit Check within 24 hours? The Application was at 2024-01-12 09:00, and Credit Check at Jan 14 10:00, which is over 24 hours. So that's a desideratum. 

The Inform Applicant for Case3 was 2024-01-16 15:00, while the Decision was on Jan 14 12:00, so the time between Decision and Inform is two days and 3 hours, which is over 48 hours, so that's another desideratum. 

Also, missing Follow-up in all cases. 

So, now compiling the answers:

1. Normative violations:

- Case2 has two normative violations: 

1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check. 

2. Finalize Documentation after Rejection. 

Case1 has none. 

Case3 has none. 

2. Desiderata violations:

Case1: 

- Credit Check took more than 24 hours (Jan 12 to Jan14 is 2 days). 

- Also, the Inform was after 48 hours (from Decision at Jan14 12:00 to Inform on Jan16 15:00 is 48 hours + 3 hours. 

- Also, they didn't do Follow-up. 

Case2: 

- The Credit Check was done after the Risk, but that's a normative violation, so not a desideratum. 

But for desiderata, maybe the timing of the Credit Check in case2: The Application was 2024-01-11 08:00, then Credit Check was at 8:20 (same day), so that's within 24 hours. 

Wait, in Case2, the Credit Check was done after the Risk Assessment, which is a normative error, but the timing between application and Credit Check (even though it was done the same day, the order was wrong. But the timing for Credit Check after application: the Credit Check was at 8:20, which is 20 minutes after Application. So the timing for Credit Check was okay (within 24 hours), but the order was wrong. 

So for desiderata in Case2, maybe the timing for Risk Assessment? Not sure, but the desiderata is about Credit Check timing and Inform timing. 

Case2's Inform time: They made the Decision at 9:30 (Loan Decision (Rejected)), then Inform at... Wait, looking at Case2's log:

Case2's timeline:

Application at 8:00,

Risk at 8:20,

Credit Check at 9:00,

Loan Decision at 9:30,

then Inform Applicant? Wait the log for Case2 shows:

After Loan Decision (Rejected) at 9:30, the next step is Finalize Docs at 10:00, then Close at 10:30. Wait in the log, the entry after Loan Decision (Rejected) is Finalize Documentation, which is a normative violation. 

Wait, the Inform step for Case2: the Loan Decision is at 9:30, then the next step is Finalize Documentation at 10:00, but they didn't do the Inform step? Wait, looking at the log for Case2:

Case2's log:

After Loan Decision (Rejected at 9:30), the next activity is Finalize Docs at 10:00, then Close at 10:30. Wait, but according to the normative rules, after Loan Decision, they must inform the applicant before closing. Wait, the normative sequence requires Inform Applicant after the Loan Decision, before closing. 

Wait, looking at the log for Case2:

After Loan Decision (Rejected), the next step is Finalize Docs (which is a normative violation because it's a rejection), but also, where's the Inform step? Wait, the log shows after the Loan Decision, the next action is Finalize Docs, but according to the normative steps, after Loan Decision, you must Inform Applicant before proceeding. 

Wait, in the log for Case2, after Loan Decision (Rejected at 9:30), the next entry is Finalize Docs at 10:00, but the Inform step is missing? Wait, the log shows for Case2:

After Loan Decision (Rejected) at 9:30, the next entry is Finalize Docs at 10:00, but the normative requires that after Decision, you must inform the applicant before proceeding. Wait, the process steps require that after Loan Decision, the next step is "Inform Applicant", so in the log, in Case2, they skipped the Inform step entirely? Wait no, let me check the log again:

Wait, looking at the table for Case2:

The log entries for Case2:

Application Received,

then Risk Assessment (wrong order),

then Credit Check,

then Loan Decision (Rejected),

then Finalize Docs (invalid step here),

then Close Case. 

Wait, but where is the Inform step? Wait, in the log for Case2, the step after Loan Decision is Finalize Docs, but according to the normative steps, after Loan Decision, you must do Inform Applicant before anything else. So in Case2, they skipped the Inform step entirely? That can't be right. Wait, looking at the table:

Looking at the log for Case2, after Loan Decision (Rejected) at 9:30, the next activity is Finalize Documentation (which is wrong because it's a rejection), then Close Case at 10:30. So they skipped "Inform Applicant" entirely. That's a normative violation because they skipped a required step. Wait, the normative process requires that after Loan Decision, you must Inform the applicant. So in Case2, they didn't do that. That's another normative violation. Wait, I missed that. Oh no, that's a big mistake.

Wait, the normative steps require "Inform Applicant" must be after Loan Decision. So in Case2, after the Loan Decision (Rejected at 9:30), the next steps are Finalize Docs and Close, but they didn't do Inform. That's a normative violation: skipping the Inform step entirely. 

Oh! That's another violation for Case2. Because the Inform step is mandatory. The normative process requires that after Loan Decision, you must Inform Applicant before proceeding. The log for Case2 skips that step entirely, so that's a normative violation. 

Wait the log for Case2 shows the Loan Decision (Rejected) at 9:30, then the next entry is Finalize Docs at 10:00, then Close at 10:30. So they skipped the Inform step. That's a serious normative violation because Inform is required. 

Oh, so Case2 actually has three normative violations: 

1. Risk before Credit Check,

2. Skipping Inform, 

3. Finalizing Docs after Rejection.

Wait, but the Finalizing Docs after rejection is already a normative violation. The skipping of Inform is another one. 

Wait, the normative sequence requires after Loan Decision comes Inform. So in Case2's log, they went from Decision to Finalize Docs (invalid) and then Close, but didn't do Inform. So that's an omission of a required step. That's a normative violation. 

Oh, I missed that earlier. That's a major issue. So Case2 has three normative violations: incorrect order (Risk before Credit), Finalize Docs after rejection, and missing Inform step. 

Wait, but the Inform is a mandatory step. The normative process says "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision". So if it's omitted, that's a violation. So that needs to be noted. 

Wait, looking back at the normative constraints:

The key constraint says "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision". So if they didn't do it at all, that's a violation. So yes, that's a third normative violation for Case2. 

So correcting my earlier thought: Case2 has three normative violations:

1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (order wrong).

2. Finalizing Docs after rejection (since they did that, which is not allowed).

3. Skipping the Inform step (which is mandatory).

Wait, but looking at the log for Case2's activities:

Looking at the table:

Case2's log:

After Loan Decision (Rejected at 9:30), the next step is Finalize Docs (10:00), then Close. But the Inform step is missing. So they didn't do Inform Applicant at all. That's a normative violation. 

Therefore, Case2 has three normative issues. 

Wait, but the problem's own example in the log for Case2 has a Finalize Docs after rejection, which is a violation. Also, the order between Credit and Risk. And missing Inform. 

Therefore, in my first analysis I missed the missing Inform step in Case2. 

Now, for Case1, all steps are done correctly, so no normative issues. 

Case3: The steps are in order. Let's check:

Case3's log:

Application at 9:00 on Jan12,

Credit Check on Jan14 10:00 (which is 2 days later, but that's a desideratum issue),

Risk, then Decision (approved),

Inform at 16th 15:00 (Decision on 14th 12:00, so to Inform within 48 hours would be until 16th 12:00. The Inform was at 15:00, which is 2 days and 3 hours, so over 48 hours. So that's a desideratum. 

Also, the Credit Check was after 24 hours (Application on 12th, Credit on 14th, which is two days later, so more than 24 hours, which is a desideratum. 

Additionally, the missing Follow-up Call in all three cases. But the desiderata is only that Follow-up is encouraged but optional, so missing it is okay but a desideratum issue. 

Now, for the desiderata violations:

Case1: 

- Did they do the Follow-up? The log doesn't show it, so that's a desideratum issue. 

- The Credit Check was done within 24 hours? The Application was received on Jan10 9:00, and Credit Check at 9:30 same day. So that's okay for Credit timing, so no desideratum issue there. 

- Inform timing: Decision at 11:00, then Inform at 13:00 (same day), so within 48 hours. So that's okay. 

Thus, Case1's desiderata issues are missing Follow-up. 

Case2's desiderata: The Credit Check was done on the same day (Application at 8:00, then Credit Check at 9:00 (same day, so within 24 hours. 

Their Inform timing: The Loan Decision at 9:30, then they went to Finalize Docs and Close. But they didn't do Inform, so the Inform is missing entirely, so the time isn't an issue here, but the normative violation is the missing step. 

So for desiderata in Case2, maybe no timing issues except the missing Inform step, but since they skipped the step entirely, that's a normative violation, not desiderata. 

Case3 has the Credit Check after 24 hours (desideratum), the Inform after 48 hours (violates the 48-hour desideratum), and missing Follow-up. 

Now, moving on to the task steps.

First part: Identify normative violations:

Case2 has three normative violations:

1. Risk before Credit (order violation),

2. Finalizing Docs after rejection (prohibited),

3. Skipping Inform step (mandatory step).

Additionally, the Finalize Docs after rejection is a normative violation. 

Wait, the normative constraints require that after Loan Decision, you must Inform Applicant. So Inform is mandatory. So skipping it is a violation. 

Therefore, Case2 has three normative violations. 

Case1: none.

Case3: none. 

Now, for desiderata:

Case1: 

- No Follow-up Call (desideratum).

Case2: 

- Missing Follow-up (desideratum), but also, the Inform was skipped (normative), so that's not a desideratum issue).

- The Credit Check was on time (Case2's Credit was within 24 hours), so no desideratum issue there. 

- The Inform wasn't done because it was skipped (normative), so no timing issue there. 

Case3: 

- Credit Check took over 24 hours (desideratum).

- Inform took over 48 hours (desideratum).

- No Follow-up.

So when compiling the answers:

1. Normative violations:

Case2 has three violations:

- Risk Assessment before Credit Check.

- Finalize Documentation after Rejection (invalid step).

- Skipping the Inform Applicant step.

Wait, but in the log for Case2, after the Loan Decision, they went to Finalize Docs, but the Inform step is missing. So that's a serious normative violation because Inform is required. 

So that's three normative violations for Case2.

Case1: none.

Case3: none.

Now, for the desiderata:

Case1 has the missing Follow-up (desideratum).

Case2: missing Follow-up, but the other desiderata (Credit Check was on time, so no. So only missing Follow-up.

Case3: the Credit Check over 24h, the Inform over 48h, and missing Follow-up.

Additionally, the Follow-up is a desideratum. 

Now, the task also asks to suggest possible justifications where possible. 

For example, in Case2, maybe the staff rushed and did Risk first, but that's a normative violation. 

Alternatively, maybe in Case2, perhaps the system automatically skips steps, but that's not justifiable. 

For the desiderata, in Case3, the delays could be due to backlogs, but that's just a recommendation. 

Now, compiling the answers step by step as per the user's question. 

The user's task 1 asks for normative violations. 

So, the answer for 1:

Case 2 has three normative violations: 

1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (violates ordering rule).

2. Finalizing Documentation after a rejected loan (contradicts the rule that you can't finalize if rejected).

3. Skipping the Inform Applicant step (since it's mandatory after decision).

Additionally, the order of Credit Check after Risk is a normative violation (since Credit must come before Risk).

Wait, the first violation is the order between Credit and Risk, so that's one violation. 

Then the Finalize after rejection is second, and the missing Inform is third. 

Case2's normative issues are three. 

Case3 has none. 

Case1 is okay. 

Now for desiderata (task 2):

Case1: 

- Failed to perform Follow-up Call (desideratum).

Case2: 

- Also failed to do Follow-up, but also, the Inform wasn't done (but that's normative).

Case3:

- Credit Check took longer than 24 hours (desideratum).

- Inform took longer than 48 hours (desideratum).

- No Follow-up.

Additionally, in Case2, the Inform wasn't done, but that's a normative violation, so not a desideratum. 

Now, the user's example in the log for Case2 has two violations noted (the Risk before Credit and Finalizing Docs after rejection), but the missing Inform is also a violation. 

So the answer must include all of these. 

Now, moving forward, to structure the answer properly.

Also, check if there are any other normative violations. 

Case2 also has the Finalize Docs after rejection which is a violation, and also, the Inform step must be done before proceeding, but they didn't do that. 

So the three normative violations in Case2.

Now, to write the answer:

First part: identify which cases violate normative rules and reasons.

Case2 has three normative violations:

1. The sequence violated because Risk Assessment (at 8:20) occurred before Credit Check (9:00). Normative rule says Credit must come before Risk.

2. Finalizing Documentation after rejection (Finalize Docs at 10:00 after rejection, which is prohibited.

3. Skipping the Inform Applicant step entirely. 

Wait, but the normative sequence requires that after Loan Decision, Inform must happen. The log shows that after the Decision, they went to Finalize Docs, then Close, so they skipped the Inform step entirely. That's a missing step, so that's another violation.

So three violations for Case2. 

Case1: none.

Case3: none.

Second part: desiderata.

Case1: 

- Failed to do Follow-up Call (desideratum).

- Wait, also, the Credit Check was on time (Case1's Credit was 30 mins after application, so that's within 24 hours. So no timing issues there. 

- The Inform in Case1 was timely (within 2h after decision, so okay. 

Thus, only the missing Follow-up is the desideratum for Case1.

Case2: 

- The Follow-up was not done (desideratum).

- The Inform was skipped (but that's a normative, so not counted here.

Case3:

- Credit Check took over 24 hours (desideratum).

- Inform took over 48 hours (desideratum).

- No Follow-up (desideratum).

Now, also check the log for Case3's Inform:

Case3's Loan Decision was on Jan14 12:00, then Inform at 16th 15:00: that's 2 days and 3 hours, which is over 48 hours? 48 hours from Jan14 12:00 would be until Jan16 12:00. The Inform was at 16:15:00, so 2 days and 3 hours is 51 hours, over 48. 

Now, for the Follow-up call, all three cases didn't do it, so each has that as a desideratum issue. 

Now, the user's log for Case3's last row has a note saying "(No Follow-up Call)", implying that in Case3, they didn't do it. The other cases may also not have it. 

Therefore, all three cases have the Follow-up missing, but in the logs, only Case3 is noted, but the table for the other cases don't have entries for Follow-up. So the log shows that they didn't do it, so it's a desideratum for all three. 

Wait, looking at the table:

Case1's log ends with Close Case, no Follow-up entry. 

Case2's log also ends with Close, no Follow-up. 

Case3's log has a note in the last row indicating no Follow-up, but the log entries don't list it. 

Therefore, all three cases missed the Follow-up, which is a desideratum. 

Therefore, the desiderata violations are:

Case1: 

- No Follow-up Call.

Case2: 

- No Follow-up, and maybe the Credit Check was on time (since in Case2 the Credit was done on the same day (Application on 1/11 8:00, Credit at 9:00, so within 24h. 

So Case2's desiderata violations are only the missing Follow-up.

Case3: 

- Credit Check over 24h,

- Inform over 48h,

- No Follow-up.

So, in the desiderata:

Case1: missing Follow-up.

Case2: missing Follow-up.

Case3: the three desiderata issues (the two timing and missing Follow-up).

Now, for the third part: suggest interpretations for the observed behaviors.

For example, in Case2:

- The Risk before Credit could be a human error or system issue.

- The Finalize Docs after rejection might be a mistake.

- The missing Inform is critical. 

Possible justification: maybe staff was in a rush, leading to wrong order and missing steps. 

For Case3's delays: backlogs, system delays, etc.

Now, putting this into the structured answer.
</think>

### 1. **Normative Violations**  
**Case 2** violates **three normative constraints**:  
- **Violation 1:** **Incorrect Order**  
  - **Risk Assessment** (at 08:20) occurred before **Credit Check** (at 09:00).  
  - Violates the rule: *Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment*.  

- **Violation 2:** **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**  
  - **Finalize Documentation** was performed at 10:00 after a **Rejected** decision (Loan Decision at 09:30).  
  - Violates the rule: *Finalize Documentation is only allowed after approval*.  

- **Violation 3:** **Missing Inform Applicant Step**  
  - The **Inform Applicant** step was entirely omitted after the Loan Decision.  
  - Violates the rule: *Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision*.  

**Case 1 and Case 3** follow the normative sequence correctly.  

---

### 2. **Desiderata (Best Practice) Violations**  
**Case 1:**  
- **Violation:** **No Follow-up Call** was performed.  
  - Desiderata violation: *Recommended to perform a Follow-up Call before closing the case*.  

**Case 2:**  
- **Violation:** **No Follow-up Call** was performed.  

**Case 3:**  
- **Violation 1:** **Credit Check Delay**  
  - Credit Check was performed **48 hours after Application** (Application on 2024-01-12 09:00  Credit Check on 2024-01-14 10:00).  
  - Desiderata violation: *Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours*.  

- **Violation 2:** **Delayed Inform Applicant**  
  - **Inform Applicant** occurred **48 hours and 3 hours after Loan Decision** (Decision at 2024-01-14 12:00  Inform at 2024-01-16 15:00.  
  - Desiderata violation: *Inform Applicant should occur within 48 hours of Loan Decision*.  

- **Violation 3:** **No Follow-up Call** was performed.  

---

### 3. **Interpretations/Justifications**  
#### **Case 2 (Normative Violations): Possible Explanations)**  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** Likely a human error due to miscommunication or rushed processing.  
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** A procedural mistake caused by misreading the loan decision.  
- **Skipping Inform Applicant:** Possibly an oversight during processing, leading to skipped steps.  

#### **Case 3 (Desiderata Violations: Possible Explanations)**  
- **Delayed Credit Check and Inform Applicant:** Backlog or system delays could have caused the delays.  
- **No Follow-up Call:** Overloaded staff may have prioritized closing the case over optional steps.  

#### **Case 1 (Desiderata Violation: No Follow-up Call)**  
- The process was otherwise flawless, but the Follow-up was omitted due to oversight or prioritization of urgent cases.  

#### **General Justification for Follow-up Omissions**  
- All cases missed the optional Follow-up Call, reflecting a common tendency to skip non-mandatory steps to save time.  

---

### Summary of Violations  
**Normative:**  
- **Case 2:** Three violations (order inversion, erroneous documentation, and missing step).  

**Desiderata:**  
- **All cases** missed the Follow-up Call.  
- **Case 3:** Delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant.  

This analysis ensures strict adherence to critical steps while noting opportunities to improve best practices.
