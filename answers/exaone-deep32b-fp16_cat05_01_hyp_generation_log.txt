Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the database schema and the example data provided. The main tables are order_event_log, orders, and resources. The normal process flow has seven steps, and the event logs should follow that sequence for each case_id. 

Looking at the example data for case_id 1001, the events are in order 1 to 7, which seems correct. But let's check the other cases to spot anomalies. 

Starting with case 1002. The events here are 8 to 14. Let me list their activities in order:

Event 8: Register Order (good, first step)
Event 9: Confirm Shipment. Wait, the normal flow after Register Order is Credit Check (step 2). But here, after registering, they jumped to Confirm Shipment (step4) before doing Credit Check (event 11 is step3? Wait, the steps are numbered as per the process flow. Let me check the process steps again:

The normal steps are:
1. Register Order (Sales)
2. Perform Credit Check (Finance)
3. Validate Stock (Warehouse)
4. Confirm Shipment (Logistics)
5. Ship Goods (Logistics)
6. Issue Invoice (Finance)
7. Receive Payment (Finance)

So the correct order should be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. 

Looking at case 1002's events:

Event 8 (Register)  then event9 is Confirm Shipment (step4). But before that, they should have done Credit Check (step2) and Validate Stock (step3). So event9 is out of order. Then event10 is Ship Goods (step5) but that comes after Confirm Shipment (step4). Wait, but the problem is the sequence before step4. The Credit Check (event11) is after Confirm Shipment here. That's a problem. So the order here is 8 (1), 9 (4), 10 (5), then 11 (2), which is wrong. That's a major anomaly. The Credit Check (step2) should come before Confirm Shipment (step4). So case 1002's events are in the wrong order. That's a big issue. 

Another thing: the events for 1002 have event9 (Confirm Shipment) before Validate Stock (event12, which is step3). So step3 (Validate Stock) should come before step4 (Confirm Shipment). But here, Validate Stock is event12, which is after Confirm Shipment (event9). So that's another violation. So the order here is messed up. 

Then, looking at case 1003. Let's see their events:

Events 15 (Register), 16 (Credit Check, step2), then 17 (Ship Goods, step5). Wait, after Credit Check (step2), they should do Validate Stock (step3) before Confirm Shipment (step4) and Ship Goods (step5). But here, after Credit Check (16), the next is Ship Goods (17). So missing Validate Stock (step3) and Confirm Shipment (step4). Then event18 is Confirm Shipment (step4) but after Ship Goods (step5)? That's also out of order. Ship Goods (5) should come after Confirm Shipment (4). So this is another anomaly. 

Additionally, the Ship Goods (event17) occurs before Confirm Shipment (event18), which is incorrect. The correct order is Confirm Shipment (4) then Ship Goods (5). So that's a problem. 

Case 1004: events 21 (Register), then 22 (Receive Payment, step7) before even issuing the invoice (step6). The Receive Payment is step7, which should come after Issue Invoice (6). But here, event22 is Receive Payment (7) before event23 (Issue Invoice, 6). That's a major issue. The invoice must be issued before payment is received. So that's a big anomaly. Also, the Confirm Shipment (event24) is after Ship Goods (event25)? Wait, event24 is Confirm Shipment (step4), then Ship Goods (25, step5) which is correct. But the problem is the order of Receive Payment before Invoice. 

Other possible anomalies: 

Looking at case 1004's event24 (Confirm Shipment) has "shipment_scheduled=N", which might indicate that confirmation was not successful, but that's more of a status than an anomaly unless it's not followed by shipping. But since they did Ship Goods (event25), maybe that's okay, but the 'N' might be a red flag. 

Another thing: checking if all steps are present. For example, case 1004 has events up to 25. Let's see the steps:

After Register (21), the next steps should be Credit Check (step2), but in case 1004, after Register (21), the next event is Receive Payment (22, step7). So they skipped steps 2,3,4,5,6. That's a major problem. So the entire flow is out of order here. 

Now, looking for other possible issues. Let's check the resources. For example, in case 1002's event9 (Confirm Shipment), the resource is LogisticsMgr_2. That's okay since Confirm Shipment is a Logistics step. 

Wait, but maybe some roles are not allowed in certain activities? The resources table has roles like SalesRep, CreditOfficer, etc. The activities are mapped to departments. For example, "Register Order" is Sales, so the resource should be from Sales (SalesRep). That seems okay in the examples. 

Another possible anomaly: in case 1004, the order_type in orders is 'standard' with order_value 3000. Maybe if it's a high value, perhaps it should be priority? But the problem says the example data's order_type for 1004 is standard. Unless there's a policy that high-value orders must be priority, but the problem doesn't state that, so maybe that's not an issue here. 

Looking for other possible issues: 

In case 1003, after Ship Goods (event17), they do Confirm Shipment (event18). That's reversed. Confirm should come before shipping. 

Another thing: the event IDs are not necessarily sequential per case. For example, case 1002 starts at event 8, which is okay as each case's events are independent. But the main issue is the sequence of activities. 

So compiling the anomalies:

1. Case 1002:
   - Credit Check (event11) occurs after Confirm Shipment (event9) and Ship Goods (event10). Steps 2 (Credit Check) should come before 3 (Validate Stock) and 4 (Confirm Shipment). So the order here is wrong.
   - Validate Stock (event12) comes after Confirm Shipment (event9), which is step3 after step4. 

2. Case 1003:
   - After Credit Check (event16), the next is Ship Goods (event17) without Validate Stock (step3) and Confirm Shipment (step4). Then Confirm Shipment (event18) comes after Ship Goods (step5), which is incorrect order.

3. Case 1004:
   - Receive Payment (event22, step7) occurs before Issue Invoice (event23, step6). This is a critical error as payment can't be received before invoicing.
   - Also, the steps before that are completely out of order. They skipped Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment (except the Confirm is event24 but after Ship Goods? Wait, Ship Goods is event25, so Confirm Shipment (24) is before Ship Goods (25), which is correct. But the main issue is the payment before invoice.

Other possible anomalies:

Looking at case 1002's event9 (Confirm Shipment) has "attempted_early=Y" in additional_info. Maybe that's allowed, but if Confirm Shipment is done before stock validation, that's a problem. 

Another thing: checking if all required steps are present. For example, case 1004 has events up to 25. Let's see:

Case 1004's events:

21: Register
22: Receive Payment (step7)
23: Issue Invoice (step6)  but this is after step7, which is wrong.
24: Confirm Shipment (step4)
25: Ship Goods (step5)

So the correct order should be steps 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. But here, after Register (21), the next steps are 22 (7), which is way out of order. So missing steps 2 (Credit Check), 3 (Validate Stock), 4 (Confirm Shipment before shipping), 5 (Ship), 6 (Invoice), then 7. But in their case, they did Confirm Shipment (24) and Ship (25) after the invoice? Wait, the invoice is event23 (step6) which comes after the payment (event22). So the order here is all messed up. 

Now, possible reasons for these anomalies:

For case 1002's out-of-order steps: Maybe the system allows events to be logged out of order? Or perhaps a misconfiguration where the steps are not enforced. Alternatively, maybe a manual intervention bypassed the normal flow, but that's a policy violation. Or a bug in the application that skips steps. 

Case1003's missing steps: Perhaps the system didn't enforce the next step, so after Credit Check, it proceeded to shipping without validating stock. Maybe a process error or automation that skips steps. 

Case1004's payment before invoice: This is a critical error. The invoice must be issued before payment is received. This could be a system error where the payment was processed before the invoice was generated, or a user error where someone initiated payment too early. 

Other possible anomalies: Let's check all cases again. 

Looking at case 1001: All steps are in order. 

Case 1002's event9 (Confirm Shipment) is done before Validate Stock (event12). So step3 is after step4. That's a problem. 

Another thing: checking the resources. For example, in case1002's event9 (Confirm Shipment), the resource is LogisticsMgr_2, which is correct. 

Wait, maybe some activities are being performed by incorrect roles? For example, "Confirm Shipment" should be done by Logistics, which they are. 

Another possible issue: in case1004, the Confirm Shipment (event24) has "shipment_scheduled=N" which might indicate it wasn't confirmed, but then they shipped anyway. Maybe that's an issue if shipment wasn't confirmed. 

Proposing SQL queries to investigate:

First, to find all cases where the event sequence doesn't follow the expected order. The expected order is the 7 steps in order. So for each case_id, the events should have their 'activity' in the order of the process steps. 

We can list the expected activity order as an array or CTE. Then, for each case, check if the activities are in that order. 

Alternatively, for each case, group the events by activity, order them by timestamp, and check the sequence. 

Another approach: For each case, the events should have the activities in the exact sequence of the 7 steps. So the first event for a case must be "Register Order", the next "Perform Credit Check", etc. 

So the SQL query could be to find any case where the activities are not in the correct sequence. 

Let me draft a query that for each case_id, checks the order of activities. 

First, create a CTE that lists the expected order of activities. Let's assign each activity an order number:

WITH activity_order AS (
    SELECT 'Register Order' AS activity, 1 AS step_num,
    'Perform Credit Check' AS activity, 2,
    'Validate Stock' AS activity, 3,
    'Confirm Shipment' AS activity,4,
    'Ship Goods' AS activity,5,
    'Issue Invoice' AS activity,6,
    'Receive Payment' AS activity,7
) AS expected_activities

Then, for each event in order_event_log, we can get their step_num, then for each case_id, check that the steps are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 in order. 

Alternatively, for each case_id, the events should be ordered by their step_num in ascending order, and each step from 1 to 7 must be present exactly once. 

So the steps would be:

1. For each case_id, collect all events, ordered by timestamp.
2. Check that the activities in order match the expected sequence.
3. Also check that all 7 steps are present (no missing steps).

So the SQL could look like this:

WITH event_sequence AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS event_order,
        activity,
        additional_info
    FROM order_event_log
),
expected_steps AS (
    VALUES 
        ('Register Order', 1),
        ('Perform Credit Check', 2),
        ('Validate Stock', 3),
        ('Confirm Shipment',4),
        ('Ship Goods',5),
        ('Issue Invoice',6),
        ('Receive Payment',7)
)
SELECT 
    es.case_id,
    es.event_order,
    es.activity,
    CASE 
        WHEN es.activity = (SELECT activity FROM expected_steps WHERE step_num = (es.event_order) ) 
        THEN 'Correct' 
        ELSE 'Anomaly' 
    END AS step_status
FROM event_sequence es
JOIN expected_steps es_step ON es.activity = es_step.activity
ORDER BY es.case_id, es.event_order;

Wait, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, for each case, the sequence of activities must be exactly the 7 in order. So for each case, the first event must be Register Order, the second Perform Credit Check, etc. 

Alternatively, the steps must be in order 1 to 7, so for each case, the sorted list of activities (by step number) must have all 7 steps, and the count must be 7. 

Another approach: For each case, check that the activities are in the exact order. Let's use a CTE to get the expected order, then for each case's events ordered by timestamp, check the sequence.

Alternatively, here's a possible query to find cases where the event sequence is incorrect:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
expected_sequence AS (
    SELECT 'Register Order' || 'Perform Credit Check' || 'Validate Stock' || 'Confirm Shipment' || 'Ship Goods' || 'Issue Invoice' || 'Receive Payment' AS correct_seq
)
SELECT 
    oe.case_id,
    oe.activity_sequence
FROM ordered_events oe
WHERE oe.activity_sequence != (SELECT correct_seq FROM expected_sequence)
ORDER BY oe.case_id;

But this might not account for exact order, but the STRING_AGG would concatenate in the order of the events sorted by timestamp. So if the actual sequence doesn't match the expected concatenated string, it's flagged. 

Alternatively, using arrays. Let's try with arrays:

WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activities_ordered
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
expected_activities ARRAY[
    'Register Order',
    'Perform Credit Check',
    'Validate Stock',
    'Confirm Shipment',
    'Ship Goods',
    'Issue Invoice',
    'Receive Payment'
]
SELECT 
    case_id,
    activities_ordered
FROM ordered_activities
WHERE activities_ordered != expected_activities;

This would return any case where the ordered activities don't exactly match the expected array. 

This query would help identify all cases with incorrect sequences. 

Another query to check for missing steps: for each case, check if all 7 activities are present. 

SELECT 
    case_id,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT activity) FROM order_event_log o WHERE o.case_id = c.case_id) AS activity_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM unnest(expected_activities) a WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log o WHERE o.case_id = c.case_id AND o.activity = a)) AS missing_steps_count
FROM ordered_activities c
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT activity) FROM ...) != 7 OR missing_steps_count >0;

But maybe that's complicating. 

Alternatively, for each case, the number of events should be exactly 7, and each activity must be present once. 

SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
WHERE COUNT(DISTINCT activity) !=7 OR COUNT(*) !=7;

This would find cases where the number of events isn't 7, or activities are duplicated/missing. 

Looking at the examples:

Case 1001 has 7 events, correct. 

Case1002 has 6 events? Wait the example for 1002 has events 8 to 14, which is 7 events (8,9,10,11,12,13,14  7 events). Wait, 8-14 is 7 events. So that's okay. But the activities may not be in order. 

Wait the problem in 1002 is the order, not the count. 

Case1004 has events 21-25, which is 5 events. So COUNT(*) would be 5, which is less than 7. So that's an issue. So that query would catch that. 

Ah, right! Case1004 only has 5 events (events 21 to 25, which is 5 events?), let me check:

Looking at the example for case 1004:

Events 21,22,23,24,25  that's 5 events. So the total events are 5, which is less than 7. So that's a problem. So the COUNT(*) would be 5, so that case would be flagged. 

So that's another anomaly: case1004 is missing some steps (like Credit Check, Validate Stock, etc.), leading to only 5 events. 

So the first SQL query to find cases with incorrect event counts would catch that. 

Another query to check for the Receive Payment happening before Issue Invoice. 

To find cases where there's a Receive Payment event that occurs before an Issue Invoice in the same case's timeline. 

SELECT 
    case_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS first_payment_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS first_invoice_time
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) < MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END)
ORDER BY case_id;

This would find cases where the first payment is before the first invoice. 

In case1004, the Receive Payment (event22) is at 2024-02-01 09:05:00, and the Issue Invoice is event23 at 09:20:00. So first_payment_time is before first_invoice_time, so this case would be flagged. 

Another query to check for Confirm Shipment before Validate Stock. 

For each case, check if there's a Confirm Shipment event that occurs before a Validate Stock event. 

SELECT 
    case_id,
    (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = c.case_id AND activity = 'Confirm Shipment' LIMIT 1) AS confirm_time,
    (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = c.case_id AND activity = 'Validate Stock' LIMIT 1) AS validate_time
FROM order_event_log c
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING (SELECT timestamp FROM ... WHERE activity='Confirm Shipment') < (SELECT ... 'Validate Stock')

This would find cases where Confirm Shipment happened before Validate Stock. 

Case1002's Confirm Shipment (event9) is at 08:25, and Validate Stock (event12) is at 09:15  so confirm is before validate  this would be flagged. 

Similarly for case1003: Confirm Shipment (event18) is at 09:45, but Validate Stock (event12? Wait case1003's Validate Stock is event12? Wait looking back:

Wait case1003's events:

15: Register

16: Credit Check

17: Ship Goods (step5)  but before Confirm Shipment (event18, step4). So Validate Stock (step3) is missing? Wait in case1003's data:

Looking at the example for case1003:

The events are:

15: Register Order

16: Perform Credit Check

17: Ship Goods (so that's step5, but before Confirm Shipment (step4). Also, there's no Validate Stock (step3) event. Wait the third event in case1003 is event17? Wait let me check again:

Wait the third example for case1003:

The third example's events are:

case_id 1003:

event 15: Register

16: Credit Check (step2)

17: Ship Goods (step5)  so missing steps 3 (Validate Stock) and 4 (Confirm Shipment). Then event18 is Confirm Shipment (step4), but after Ship Goods (step5). So Validate Stock is completely missing here. So the Validate Stock step is not present. So the count would be 5 events (15-19, but let's count):

Events 15,16,17,18,19,20? Wait the third example's case1003 has 6 events:

Looking at the third example:

Events 15 to 20:

15: Register

16: Credit Check

17: Ship Goods (event17)

18: Confirm Shipment (event18)

19: Issue Invoice (event19?)

Wait the third example's table shows:

For case 1003:

| 1003 | 15 | Register Order | ... |

Then 16: Credit Check,

17: Ship Goods,

18: Confirm Shipment,

19: Issue Invoice,

20: Receive Payment.

Wait that's 6 events. So total 6 events. So missing Validate Stock (step3). So the count would be 6, which is less than 7. So the COUNT(*) query would catch that. 

So the queries would help identify these issues. 

Now, hypothesizing the causes:

For case1002's out-of-order steps:

Possible reasons:

- The system allows events to be recorded out of order (maybe the timestamp is incorrect, or events are logged asynchronously and there's a delay). 

- A misconfiguration where the process steps are not enforced, so the application allows proceeding to the next step without completing the prior ones. 

- A manual override where a user bypassed certain steps, leading to a policy violation. 

- A bug in the application that skips steps under certain conditions (e.g., if stock is pre-validated elsewhere). 

Case1003's missing Validate Stock and Confirm Shipment before shipping:

Possible reasons:

- The stock validation step was skipped due to an error (e.g., the system didn't check stock because it was out of stock but still allowed shipping? Or an automated process assumed stock was okay). 

- The process flow was altered without proper checks, leading to skipping steps. 

- Human error where the warehouse clerk proceeded to ship without validating stock, and then confirmed shipment afterward (but that's out of order). 

Case1004's missing steps and payment before invoice:

- The invoice wasn't generated before payment was processed, which could be a system error where the payment gateway was called before the invoice was saved. 

- The user might have manually triggered the payment before the invoice was issued, which is a policy violation. 

- The application might have a race condition where payment is processed before the invoice is marked as ready. 

Another possible issue in case1004: the Confirm Shipment has "shipment_scheduled=N", which might indicate that confirmation wasn't completed, but they still shipped. That could be an issue if shipment requires confirmation. 

Proposing the SQL queries as per the problem's request. The user wants queries to investigate the hypotheses without guidance. 

Possible queries:

1. Find all cases with incorrect number of events (not 7):

SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING COUNT(*) !=7;

2. Find cases where Receive Payment occurs before Issue Invoice:

SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment' 
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING MIN(timestamp) < (
    SELECT MIN(timestamp) 
    FROM order_event_log 
    WHERE case_id = ol.case_id AND activity = 'Issue Invoice'
)
QUALIFY (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM ...) > ... ;

Alternatively, using a subquery:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM order_event_log o1, order_event_log o2
WHERE o1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
AND o2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
AND o1.timestamp < o2.timestamp
GROUP BY case_id;

But perhaps better with a correlated subquery:

SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log ol
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log o WHERE o.case_id = ol.case_id AND o.activity = 'Receive Payment' 
    AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log o2 WHERE o2.case_id = ol.case_id AND o2.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND o2.timestamp > o.timestamp)
)
Wait maybe better to do:

SELECT 
    case_id
FROM order_event_log AS receive
JOIN order_event_log AS invoice 
    ON receive.case_id = invoice.case_id 
WHERE receive.activity = 'Receive Payment' 
    AND invoice.activity = 'Issue Invoice' 
    AND receive.timestamp < invoice.timestamp 
GROUP BY case_id;

Wait no, that would find cases where there exists at least one Receive Payment before an Invoice. But actually, we need the first Receive Payment to be before the first Invoice. 

Alternatively:

SELECT 
    case_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS first_payment,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS first_invoice
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) AS sub
WHERE first_payment < first_invoice;

Yes, this would work. 

3. Check for Confirm Shipment before Validate Stock:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM order_event_log cs
JOIN order_event_log vs 
    ON cs.case_id = vs.case_id 
WHERE cs.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
    AND vs.activity = 'Validate Stock' 
    AND cs.timestamp < vs.timestamp;

This finds cases where Confirm Shipment happened before Validate Stock. 

4. Check for Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM order_event_log ship
JOIN order_event_log confirm 
    ON ship.case_id = confirm.case_id 
WHERE ship.activity = 'Ship Goods' 
    AND confirm.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
    AND ship.timestamp < confirm.timestamp;

This would find cases where shipping happened before confirming shipment, which is incorrect. 

5. Check for missing steps (like Validate Stock not present):

SELECT case_id, 'Missing Validate Stock' AS issue
FROM (
    SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock'
) missing 
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = missing.case_id AND activity = 'Validate Stock')
Wait no, better to do:

SELECT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log WHERE activity != 'Validate Stock'
) AS cases
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log o WHERE o.case_id = cases.case_id AND o.activity = 'Validate Stock') = 0;

Alternatively:

SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock' 
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING COUNT(*) <1 
Wait no, perhaps:

SELECT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
) AS cases;

Alternatively, using a LEFT JOIN:

SELECT oe.case_id
FROM order_event_log oe
LEFT JOIN order_event_log vs ON oe.case_id = vs.case_id AND vs.activity = 'Validate Stock'
WHERE vs.activity IS NULL
GROUP BY oe.case_id;

This would find cases where there's no Validate Stock event. 

Similarly for other missing steps. 

Putting this all together, the proposed queries would help identify the anomalies. 

The hypotheses for the anomalies would be as discussed earlier, like system errors, process skips, user errors, etc.
</thought>

### Identified Anomalies and Hypotheses

#### **Anomalies Detected:**
1. **Case 1002**:
   - **Out-of-order steps**: "Confirm Shipment" (step 4) occurs before "Credit Check" (step 2) and "Validate Stock" (step 3).
   - **Missing Validate Stock**: No "Validate Stock" event (step 3).
   - **Confirm Shipment before Validate Stock**: Confirm Shipment (event 9) precedes Validate Stock (event 12).

2. **Case 1003**:
   - **Missing Validate Stock**: No "Validate Stock" event (step 3).
   - **Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment**: "Ship Goods" (event 17) occurs before "Confirm Shipment" (event 18, step 4).
   - **Incomplete steps**: Only 6 events (missing "Receive Payment"? No—wait, the example shows 6 events but the total should be 7. Wait, let me recount: 15-20 is 6 events. So missing one step (likely "Receive Payment" is present but the count is 6? Wait no, the example for 1003 has 6 events, so missing one step (e.g., "Receive Payment" is present but the total is 6? Wait the example shows 6 events, so missing one step (e.g., "Confirm Shipment" is present but missing another step? Let me check again:

Case 1003's events:
- Register (15)
- Credit Check (16)
- Ship Goods (17)  skips Validate Stock (step3)
- Confirm Shipment (18)
- Issue Invoice (19)
- Receive Payment (20)  total 6 events. Missing "Validate Stock" (step3). So total steps missing one (step3).

3. **Case 1004**:
   - **Incorrect Payment Order**: "Receive Payment" (event 22) occurs before "Issue Invoice" (event 23).
   - **Incomplete steps**: Only 5 events (missing "Credit Check", "Validate Stock", and possibly others).
   - **Confirm Shipment with "N" status**: Shipment confirmation may be incomplete.

---

### Hypotheses for Anomalies:
1. **Case 1002’s Out-of-Order Steps**:
   - **Policy Violation**: A manual override bypassed credit checks and stock validation.
   - **System Bug**: The application allowed proceeding to "Confirm Shipment" without prior steps due to a missing guard clause.
   - **Data Entry Error**: Events were logged out of sequence due to timestamp mismanagement.

2. **Case 1003’s Missing Validate Stock**:
   - **Automation Flaw**: Stock validation was skipped automatically (e.g., assumed stock was sufficient).
   - **Human Error**: Warehouse team shipped without validating stock, leading to an unrecorded step.

3. **Case 1004’s Payment Before Invoice**:
   - **Race Condition**: Payment processing triggered before invoice generation (e.g., API call order issue).
   - **User Error**: Finance team processed payment manually before invoice was finalized.

### Proposed SQL Queries for Investigation:

#### **1. Detect Incorrect Event Counts (Must Have Exactly 7 Events):**
```sql
SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING COUNT(*) != 7;
```

#### **2. Identify Payment Before Invoice:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS first_payment,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS first_invoice
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) AS sub
WHERE first_payment < first_invoice;
```

#### **3. Confirm Shipment Before Validate Stock:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM order_event_log cs
JOIN order_event_log vs ON cs.case_id = vs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
  AND vs.activity = 'Validate Stock' 
  AND cs.timestamp < vs.timestamp;
```

#### **4. Ship Goods Before Confirm Shipment:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM order_event_log ship
JOIN order_event_log confirm ON ship.case_id = confirm.case_id
WHERE ship.activity = 'Ship Goods' 
  AND confirm.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
  AND ship.timestamp < confirm.timestamp;
```

#### **5. Missing Validate Stock Step:**
```sql
SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock' 
GROUP BY case_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) = 0; -- Exclude cases where it exists
-- Alternatively:
SELECT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log
) AS cases
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log 
    WHERE case_id = cases.case_id AND activity = 'Validate Stock'
);
```

#### **6. Check for Unusual "Confirm Shipment" Statuses:**
```sql
SELECT case_id, resource, additional_info
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND (additional_info LIKE '%N%' OR additional_info LIKE '%late%');
```

### Summary:
These queries will help pinpoint anomalies like missing steps, incorrect sequences, and policy breaches. Further investigation would involve cross-referencing with the `orders` and `resources` tables (e.g., checking if high-value orders in `orders` align with priority handling). For example:
```sql
-- Check if high-value orders (order_value > 2000) are marked as 'priority':
SELECT o.case_id, o.order_value, o.order_type
FROM orders o
JOIN order_event_log e ON o.case_id = e.case_id
WHERE o.order_value > 2000 AND o.order_type != 'priority';
```
