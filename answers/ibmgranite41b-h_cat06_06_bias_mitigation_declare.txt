# Added constraints to mitigate potential bias in decision-making
declare_model["succession"]["CheckApplicantRace"] = {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
declare_model["chainresponse"]["RequestAdditionalInfo"] = {
    "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
}

# Rationale for Added Constraints:
# - The added `succession` constraint ensures that activities leading to decisions cannot directly follow those involving sensitive attributes without a bias mitigation check.
# - This mitigates the risk of immediate biased outcomes by requiring additional checks (e.g., ManualReview) before concluding on applicants from minority demographics, thus enforcing fairness in decision processes.

```

### Explanation:
The updated `declare_model` includes two new constraints within the "succession" section. The first constraint enforces that any activity leading to a final decision must follow a "ManualReview" if it occurs after checking an applicant's race (or other sensitive attribute), ensuring transparency and fairness in decision-making based on potentially discriminatory factors.

The second added `chainresponse` constraint ensures that the transition from handling requests for additional information (`RequestAdditionalInfo`) does not directly lead to immediate decisions like rejection without first involving a manual review. This helps prevent bias by introducing an additional step where sensitive attributes are evaluated, enhancing fairness in assessing applications based on demographic or other potentially biased factors.

These constraints collectively ensure a more equitable process within the loan application review context, addressing potential biases related to applicant demographics and promoting fair decision-making processes.
