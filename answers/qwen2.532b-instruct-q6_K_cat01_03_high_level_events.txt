To achieve the goal of transforming granular events into meaningful high-level process steps, we can follow these logical groupings based on the sample provided:

### High-Level Steps Identified and Justified

1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Activities:**
     - Retrieve raw metal sheet
     - Scan barcode
     - Place metal sheet on table
     - Align metal sheet
     - Preheat metal sheet
   - **Rationale:** These activities are logically connected as they all pertain to the preparation of the raw material before any assembly or processing steps. The sequence involves identifying, placing, aligning, and preparing the metal sheet for further operations.

2. **Assembly**
   - **Activities:**
     - Pick up welding tool
     - Weld corner A
     - Weld corner B
   - **Rationale:** These activities involve using a specific tool (welding) to join parts together. They are directly related to assembling the metal sheet into its final form by performing spot welds.

3. **Quality Inspection**
   - **Activities:**
     - Measure weld integrity
     - Visual check
   - **Rationale:** Both of these activities involve checking the quality and ensuring that the assembly meets certain standards. The measure of weld integrity checks for structural strength, while a visual check can spot any visible defects or issues.

4. **Coating Application**
   - **Activities:**
     - Apply protective coating
     - Dry coating
   - **Rationale:** These activities are closely related to applying and curing the coating on the assembled product. The application of coating ensures durability, while drying is a necessary step to fixate it properly.

### Proposed Names for High-Level Activities

1. **Material Preparation**
2. **Assembly**
3. **Quality Inspection**
4. **Coating Application**

### Output Format: Structured Representation of Aggregated Process Stages

```plaintext
High-Level Activity Name | Included Low-Level Events
-----------------------------------------------------
Material Preparation     | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet
Assembly                 | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B
Quality Inspection       | Measure weld integrity, Visual check
Coating Application      | Apply protective coating, Dry coating
```

### Explanation of Groupings

- **Material Preparation:** This step involves all initial actions necessary to get the raw material ready for assembly.
- **Assembly:** Encompasses activities directly related to joining parts together.
- **Quality Inspection:** Involves verifying the quality and integrity of assembled components.
- **Coating Application:** Covers applying protective coatings and ensuring they are properly dried.

This structured representation allows a clear understanding of each phase in the manufacturing process, making it easier for stakeholders to monitor and manage different aspects of production efficiently.
