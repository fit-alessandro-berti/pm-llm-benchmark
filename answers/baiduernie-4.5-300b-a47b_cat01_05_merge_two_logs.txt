# Merged Event Log for Order#1234

Below is the merged event log integrating data from System A and System B, with detailed reasoning for matching decisions and attribute integration.

## Merged Event Log (Timestamps normalized to UTC, sorted chronologically)

| **Event Timestamp (UT)**  | **System A Event**              | **System B Event**              | **Merged Event Type**          | **Order ID**   | **Additional Attributes (Combined)** | **Reasoning** |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z         | -                                | OrderReceived                   | Order Received                 | Order#1234     | `user_id: u45`, `resource_id: r10`, `notes: "Event captured at warehouse system"` | Matched due to identical event meaning ("Order Received" vs. "OrderReceived"). Log B timestamp used as closest to real event time (vs. Log A's "00:00:00Z", which may represent processing/receipt time). Tolerance considered due to system delays. |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z         | Order Validated                | OrderValidation                 | Order Validated                | Order#1234     | `user_id: u12`, `resource_id: r10`, `notes: "Cross-check inventory"`<br>*(System A contributed only basic attributes for this event)* | Matched due to similar event meaning ("Order Validated" vs. "OrderValidation"). Log B timestamp slightly earlier (1 second), consistent with real-time event logging vs. Log A's logged receipt time. |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z         | Payment Processed             | PaymentCheck                    | **Separate but related events**: "Payment Processed" (A) and "PaymentCheck" (B) | Order#1234     | From A: None<br>From B: `user_id: u12`, `resource_id: r99`, `notes: "Payment gateway delay"` | Not merged because "Payment Processed" and "PaymentCheck" seem to represent distinct actions:“”“”5B |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z         | -                              | Quality Check                    | Quality Check                   | Order#1234     | `user_id: u45`, `resource_id: r11`, `notes: "Random inspection"` | No match in Log A; unique to System B (possible missing step in Log A or Log A labeled differently). Included as-is with source indication. |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z         | Item Shipped                  | Shipping                         | Item Shipped                    | Order#1234     | From A: None<br>From B: `user_id: u45`, `resource_id: r10`, `notes: "Package handed to courier"` | Matched by event meaning ("Item Shipped" vs. "Shipping") and order ID. Log B timestamp (10:05:02Z) within 2s of Log A (10:05:00Z); chose Log A timestamp as primary, included B's attributes. |
| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z         | Item Delivered                | -                                | Item Delivered                  | Order#1234     | *(System A contributed all attributes for this event)* | No match in Log B; unique to System A. Included as-is. |

## **Reasoning & Decisions**

### **1. Event Matching Strategy**
   - **Primary Key**: `order_id` (Order#1234)
   - **Timestamp Tolerance**: 2 seconds window for identifying matching events. Small differences attributed to network/processing delays.
   - **Event Name Similarity**: Used semantic understanding to pair events with similar purposes ("OrderReceived" ~ "Order Received", "OrderValidation" ~ "Order Validated").

### **2. Timestamp Resolution**
   - For matched events:
     - When timestamps were within tolerance (e.g., "Order Received"), chose the earliest (most realistic) timestamp (Log B: `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z` vs. Log A: `10:00:00Z`).
     - When Tolerance Exceeded or Events Clearly Different: Kept separate, even if close in time (e.g., "Payment Processed" vs. "PaymentCheck").
   - For unmatched events: Kept original timestamps.

### **3. Attribute Integration**
   - All attributes from both logs included in the merged record.
   - For merged events, combined attributes from both logs when present (e.g., `user_id`, `notes`).
   - When events remain distinct, listed separately and indicated origin.

### **4. Handling Unique Events**
   - Log B's "Quality Check": Not present in Log A; included as a separate event.
   - Log A's "Item Delivered": Not present in Log B; included as a separate event.
   - "Payment Processed" and "PaymentCheck": Not merged (different meanings, time diff > tolerance), both listed.

## **Final Chronological Event Sequence**

1. **2023-10-10T09:59:58Z**: Order Received (Merged)
2. **2023-10-10T10:01:29Z**: Order Validated (Merged)
3. **2023-10-10T10:02:00Z**: Payment Processed (System A Only)
4. **2023-10-10T10:02:05Z**: PaymentCheck (System B Only)
5. **2023-10-10T10:03:00Z**: Quality Check (System B Only)
6. **2023-10-10T10:05:00Z**: Item Shipped (Merged)
7. **2023-10-10T10:20:00Z**: Item Delivered (System A Only)

## **Summary of Key Decisions**
   - All matched events merged with enriched attributes.
   - Close-but-distinct events kept separate with full context.
   - Non-overlapping and unique events included from both logs.
   - Primary timestamp for ordering: earliest when merged; original when separate.
