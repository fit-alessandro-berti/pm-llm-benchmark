Below is a “plain-English” reconstruction of how the loan-approval workflow would run if every trace of the information-system log had to satisfy the DECLARE constraints you supplied.  For clarity, the description is written as if a single loan file is moving through the organisation; repeat occurrences (e.g., several requests for extra documents) are possible unless the rule explicitly forbids multiple executions.


1.  Customer intake  
   • The process always starts with Receive Application (init + existence).  
   • The activity may happen only once or many times?  
     – No rule forbids repeats, but non-coexistence later (Transfer Funds  Receive Application) makes it clear that all “receive” events for this loan must finish before money is ever disbursed.  
   • Business motive: the firm wants an unmistakable start event so that case-IDs, legal time limits, and FAIR-lending clocks begin at a known moment.

2.  Mandatory, single preliminary credit check  
   • Rule exactly_one demands exactly one Preliminary Credit Check per case.  
   • Response (Receive Application  Preliminary Credit Check) forces the check to occur at some point after the application is received.  
   • Chainprecedence (Authorize Contract Terms ¹ Preliminary Credit Check) requires the credit check to be immediately before any contract authorisation.  
   • Motivation: regulators (e.g., CFPB in the U.S.) and internal credit policy insist on a documented credit decision that is not influenced by later steps; limiting it to exactly once prevents “fishing” for a better score.

3.  Collecting evidence from the applicant  
   • Succession (Preliminary Credit Check  Gather Additional Documents) says that every credit check must eventually be followed by at least one document-gathering step.  
   • Existence also guarantees that Gathering Additional Documents happens somewhere in the case, even if a perfect credit score is obtained.  
   • Coexistence (Gather Additional Documents  Authorize Contract Terms) means the file cannot be authorised unless extra documents have been gathered at least once, and vice-versa.  
   • Practical reason: “trust-but-verify.” Even a prime borrower must supply ID, proof of income, etc., before the firm may legally bind itself.

4.  Building the offer package  
   • Once the paperwork is in, the underwriter or automated assembler prepares the Loan Offer Package.  
   • Chainsuccession (Quality Assurance Review ¹ Assemble Loan Offer Package) demands that a QA review is immediately followed by assembling the final documents. In other words, the QA reviewer signs off, then the system freezes the configuration and produces the contractual package without room for silent edits.  
   • Responded existence (Assemble Loan Offer Package  Quality Assurance Review) ensures that every offer is eventually reviewed by QA; the two rules combined create a tight “QA then freeze” sandwich.  
   • Precedence (Quality Assurance Review < Authorize Contract Terms) additionally blocks management from authorising terms that have not passed QA.  
   • Business motive: four-eyes-principle; SOX-style internal control; prevention of mispricing or compliance breaches.

5.  Final authorisation of contract terms  
   • After QA and assembly, Authorize Contract Terms may occur, but the chainprecedence rule guarantees the prelim credit check is the event immediately before it, and QA must have appeared somewhere earlier.  
   • Nonchainsuccession (Authorize Contract Terms ¹ Notify Customer) forbids an immediate jump from authorisation straight to customer notification. A gap must exist—for example, funds transfer or other internal postings—before notification.  
   • Operationally, this gives treasury a window to perform an antifraud or “positive pay” check before the customer is told the money is on its way.

6.  Disbursement and notification  
   • Chainresponse (Assemble Loan Offer Package ¹ Transfer Funds) means that as soon as the offer package is assembled, the very next recorded step must be the fund transfer (or a technical posting that represents it).  
   • Alt-response and alt-precedence couple Transfer Funds and Notify Customer bidirectionally:  
     – If funds are transferred, the customer must eventually be notified (alt-response).  
     – If the customer is notified, funds must have been transferred first or eventually (alt-precedence).  
   • Nonsuccession (Notify Customer  Preliminary Credit Check) prevents any late “re-pull” of credit after the customer has been told the outcome—avoiding Fair-credit Act violations.  
   • Noncoexistence (Transfer Funds  Receive Application) blocks the possibility that the system accidentally logs a new application after, or in parallel with, a disbursement for the same case—helping reconciliation and AML screening.

7.  Forbidden behaviour  
   • Absence (Proceed Without Compliance) states that the “skip controls” activity must never appear; its presence would mark the trace as non-compliant.  
   • Real-world driver: financial-services regulators consider deliberate bypass of compliance steps a severe violation, often carrying personal liability for officers.


What could go wrong if rules are broken?

• Money-laundering risk and regulator fines  
  – If Transfer Funds occurred before KYC documents (violating Succession and Coexistence), the bank could face AML penalties.

• Unfair-lending or ECOA violation  
  – Running multiple credit checks and cherry-picking the best one (violating Exactly One) can constitute disparate-impact discrimination.

• Customer-experience failure  
  – Notifying the customer before funds actually leave treasury (breaking Alt-precedence) may erode trust and trigger complaint-management costs.

• Financial misstatement or internal-fraud window  
  – Authorising terms without QA (breaking Precedence) opens the door to mispriced loans or rogue employee behaviour.

• Audit trail collapse  
  – Logging a new Receive Application after funds go out (breaking Noncoexistence) can confuse auditors, making it look as if money moved without any formal request.


Why DECLARE-style constraints are attractive here

1. Flexibility: The model does not prescribe an exact flowchart; it only forbids or requires certain temporal relationships. This supports straight-through processing for low-risk borrowers while still allowing manual detours (extra document requests, additional QA cycles) where needed.

2. Compliance transparency: Each constraint maps directly to a policy clause, making it easy to show regulators which log patterns would constitute a breach.

3. Risk mitigation: Negative constraints (absence, non-succession, non-coexistence) give explicit “red lines,” reducing the chance that edge-case behaviour slips through test scenarios.

4. Operational efficiency: Chain rules tighten the hand-offs that are most vulnerable to silent modification (QA  Assemble; Assemble  Transfer), cutting rework and reconciliation time.

In short, the DECLARE model embodies a balanced loan-origination strategy: rigorous enough to satisfy auditors and regulators, but declarative enough to let the organisation handle many product variants and exception paths without rewriting the workflow every time business rules evolve.
