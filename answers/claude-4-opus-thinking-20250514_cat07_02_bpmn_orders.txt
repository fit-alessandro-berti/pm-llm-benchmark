This is a business process diagram (BPMN) showing an order fulfillment workflow across four organizational departments or roles, represented as horizontal swim lanes:

**1. Seller (top lane):**
- The process starts on Monday morning
- Checks order for completeness
- Verifies if customer exists in database (decision diamond)
- If not, adds customer to database
- Sends order details and creates a draft invoice

**2. Production (second lane):**
- Receives order details
- Plans production
- Manufactures product (with a note about "Material not faulty")
- Completes product

**3. Procurement (third lane):**
- Receives order details
- Contains a subprocess for "Material Compensation" which includes:
  - Ordering materials
  - Option to return materials
- Checks materials
- Can result in order cancellation

**4. Warehouse (bottom lane):**
- Receives completed product
- Sends product to customer

The diagram uses standard BPMN notation with:
- Circles for start/end events
- Rectangles for tasks/activities
- Diamonds for decision points (gateways)
- Dashed lines showing information flow between departments
- A rounded rectangle representing a subprocess

The overall flow shows how an order moves through different departments from initial receipt through production and finally shipment to the customer.
