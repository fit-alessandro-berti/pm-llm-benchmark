Below is a summary of which cases deviate and exactly how they breach the normative rules.

1. Case 1:  
   – Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
   – Verdict: **Compliant** (matches the “inventory sufficient” happy path).

2. Case 2:  
   – Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close  
   – Violations:  
     • “Package items” occurs at 10:00 _before_ “Authorize payment” at 10:30.  
       – Normative rule: items must be packaged only after payment is authorized.  
     • As a result, the logical guard (authorize  package) is inverted.

3. Case 3:  
   – Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close  
   – Violations:  
     1. Shipping after cancellation:  
        – “Cancel order” (10:00) should immediately lead to “Close order.” No fulfillment steps (package or ship) may follow a cancellation.  
     2. (Implicit) Authorization in a cancellation branch:  
        – In the normative description, an inventoryinsufficient check should go directly to “Cancel order,” without authorizing payment.  

4. Case 4:  
   – Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
   – Verdict: **Compliant** (matches the “inventory insufficient” path: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close).

5. Case 5:  
   – Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close  
   – Violations:  
     • “Ship order” at 11:00 occurs with no preceding “Package items.”  
       – Normative rule: you must package items before you ship them.

Summary of deviating cases: **2, 3, and 5**  
Each of these cases breaks one or more of the core sequencing constraints derived from the normative description:  
• Package items only after Authorize payment  
• Ship order only after Package items and never after Cancel  
• Cancel order (in the shortage branch) must not be preceded by payment authorization, and no fulfillment steps may follow it
