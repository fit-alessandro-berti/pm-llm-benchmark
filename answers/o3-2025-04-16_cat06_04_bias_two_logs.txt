Summary  
• The protectedgroup log (Group A) is internally consistent: whatever creditscore threshold the organisation is using (720) is applied mechanically and no record ever shows a positive “ScoreAdjustment”.  
• In the unprotectedgroup log (Group B) the same credit pipeline is augmented by a systematic +10point “Community Boost” that is granted only when two conditions are TRUE:
  1. LocalResident = TRUE, and
  2. CommunityGroup  None (e.g., “Highland Civic Darts Club”).

Because every Group B applicant is a local resident and two of the three belong to the named club, they obtain the boost; nobody in Group A ever receives it. This is a classic case of featurebased bias that favours one population in a way that the other population cannot realistically satisfy.

Where and how the bias shows up  

1. ScoreAdjustment column  
   • Group A: always 0.  
   • Group B: +10 for U001 and U003.  
    The scoring formula gives extra points exclusively to the unprotected group.

2. Effect on decision boundaries  
   • Operational approval line (inferred): 720.  
   • P002 (Group A, raw 710) is rejected.  
   • U003 (Group B, raw 695) is approved after the +10 uplift (705)—even though its unadjusted score is lower than P002’s.  
   • Thus the same substantive creditworthiness is treated differently, violating “similar treatment for similar scores”.

3. Interaction of LocalResident and CommunityGroup  
   • Only applicants who answer LocalResident = TRUE are considered for CommunityGroup membership; newcomers or migrants (LocalResident = FALSE) cannot benefit.  
   • CommunityGroup itself is a facially neutral attribute, but in practice it is highly correlated with group membership and therefore acts as a proxy for protected status.

4. Statistical outcome comparison  
   Approval rate:  
     – Group A: 2/3 = 66.7 %  
     – Group B: 2/3 = 66.7 %  
   Superficially identical, but the conditional approval rate for applicants with scores <720 is 0 % for Group A and 100 % for Group B (1/1). This is disparate treatment hidden inside similar headline numbers.

Why this is problematic  

• Direct differential treatment: A fixed bonus is explicitly awarded on the basis of attributes available only to the unprotected group.  
• Proxy discrimination: “CommunityGroup” functions as a standin for group membership, allowing the system to justify preferential treatment without naming the protected class.  
• Potential disparate impact: Even if the rule was intended to encourage civic engagement, its practical effect is to exclude nonlocals/immigrants from equal access to credit.

Recommendations  

1. Remove or neutralise the CommunityGroup uplift unless it can be shown to be jobrelated/businessnecessary and equally attainable by the protected group.  
2. Reevaluate thresholds using only legitimate creditperformance predictors; test for disparate treatment and disparate impact.  
3. If a communityengagement feature is retained, ensure parity by offering equivalent programmes to all applicants, and document how the boost is earned.  
4. Monitor the pipeline with fairness dashboards that surface differences not only in overall approval rates but also in scorebandspecific outcomes.
