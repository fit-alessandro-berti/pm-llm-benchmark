Short answer  
• The bias is visible in the Group B (Un-protected) log.  
• The source of the bias is the “Community Boost” (+10) that is only given when both LocalResident = TRUE and CommunityGroup  None.  
• Because every case in Group B satisfies at least the first condition (LocalResident = TRUE) and two of the three cases also belong to the club, those applicants receive an automatic uplift that is never granted to the applicants in Group A (LocalResident = FALSE, CommunityGroup = None).  
• The uplift is large enough to flip an unfavourable decision to a favourable one (e.g., U003 is approved while the better-scoring P002 is rejected). That is explicit disparate treatment and produces a systematic difference in final outcomes.

Detailed comparison  

1. LocalResident  
   – Group A: always FALSE  
   – Group B: always TRUE  
   The attribute is therefore perfectly collinear with group membership and functions as a proxy for the protected characteristic.

2. CommunityGroup  
   – Group A: always “None”  
   – Group B: two of the three cases belong to “Highland Civic Darts Club.”  
   CommunityGroup is therefore also correlated with group membership.

3. ScoreAdjustment  
   – Group A: 0 or N/A in every trace.  
   – Group B: +10 when CommunityGroup is present (“Community Boost”); 0 otherwise.  
   The adjustment is never applied to the protected group, so the scoring rule has a built-in group-specific advantage.

4. Impact on decisions  
   a. Common raw-score threshold appears to be 720.  
   b. Without adjustment, both P002 (710) and U003 (695) are below that cut-off.  
      • P002 (protected) stays below the threshold and is rejected.  
      • U003 (un-protected) is lifted to 705  approved.  
   c. The purely algorithmic part (PreliminaryScoring) is identical across groups; the divergence is introduced later in the pipeline by ScoreAdjustment.

5. Statistical picture (3 cases per group)  

   Raw approval rate (before any boost and assuming 720 threshold)  
       – Group A: 2/3 approved  
       – Group B: 1/3 approved  

   Final approval rate (after boost)  
       – Group A: 2/3 approved (unchanged)  
       – Group B: 2/3 approved (boosted)  

   A protected applicant with a higher raw score (P002, 710) is rejected, while an un-protected applicant with a lower raw score (U003, 695) is accepted. That is direct evidence of discriminatory treatment.

How the bias manifests  
• Disparate treatment: The rules openly give extra points only to the un-protected group.  
• Disparate impact: The protected group never benefits from the Community Boost, so its members need higher raw scores to achieve the same final decision probability.  
• Process bias: The same business rule (“Community Boost”) is executed by the same system component (Scoring Engine) but is triggered only for one population.

Why it matters  
By embedding location and club membership into the scoring logic without offering an equivalent benefit to the protected group, the process violates common fairness criteria:  
– Demographic parity: selection rates differ once the boost is applied.  
– Equality of opportunity: applicants with the same underlying credit quality do not have equal acceptance probabilities.

In short, Group B’s log reveals a policy that advantages applicants who are local club members—an attribute that, in the data provided, is exclusive to the un-protected group. That creates systematic, measurable bias against the protected group.
