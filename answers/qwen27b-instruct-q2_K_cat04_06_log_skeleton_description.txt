Based on the provided data, it appears to represent a system for managing declarations that have gone through various stages of approval and processing within an organization likely involving finance or administrative roles. Here's my understanding of the activities:

Each declaration seems to follow specific pathways marked by various states or actions taken throughout its lifecycle:

- Declaration has been "SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" indicating they've completed required forms or processes awaiting review.
  
- It then moves towards approval stages:
    -* Approver #1 (initially a 'PRE_APPROVER') evaluates the declaration ('APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', or if they reject it they're simply 'REJECTION'), moving forward if approved elsewhere ('FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR').
    -* 'BUDGET OWNER' provides further review, often approving after 'SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.
    
- Further stages involve:
    -* 'ADMINISTRATION' typically takes part in one-off approvals or final steps related to financial processes.
    -* 'SUPERVISOR' and higher-level 'BUDGET OWNER' provide additional approval and validation stages.

- Other actions like 'FOR_APPROVAL' indicate the declaration is awaiting specific approvals at different levels ('by SUPERVISOR', 'PRE_APPROVER').
  
- 'FINAL_APPROVAL' suggests final approval steps following previous evaluations across various roles in an organization.

- 'REJECTED' instances indicate that after all reviews were conducted successfully elsewhere, there was a problem (with one of 'MISSING', indicating another role or the system didn't confirm expected actions) that led to rejection at one point (`BUDGET OWNER`, `PRE_APPROVER`, `ADMINISTRATION`).
  
- 'SAVINGS by EMPLOYEE' likely refers an instance where they've saved their work or declaration for further reference or future processing.

The data follows a series of approved paths typically for financial processes needing many stages and approvals across multiple roles within an organization for a declaration's passage through different stages starting from the point of origin by employees up until final approval or rejection by senior validation points (`BUDGET OWNER`, `SUPERVISOR`).

Please note that some actions (e.g., 'REJECTED by EMPLOYEE') seem repetitive or contradictory without clear context on how these statuses were meant to transition between roles, but overall the data appears consistent with standard internal management workflows for declarations in many administrative processes requiring various levels of approval across a hierarchy before proceeding
