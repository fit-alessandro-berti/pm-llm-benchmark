To address the deep-rooted scheduling and performance challenges at Precision Parts Inc., we apply advanced process mining analytics paired with dynamic, data-driven scheduling strategies. The goal is to uncover hidden inefficiencies, understand the true behavior of the shop floor, and implement informed interventions that reduce tardiness, improve resource utilization, and provide predictability in operations.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

Process mining leverages event logs to reconstruct the actual execution of processes and extract performance insights. With MES logs capturing detailed timestamped task, resource, and job-level data, we can uncover how operations truly unfold on the shop floor.

### a) Reconstructing Job Flows and Task Sequences

Using process discovery techniques like the Heuristic Miner or Inductive Miner:

- Reconstruct process models for different variants (job routings) to understand the **actual sequences** of tasks (including rework, skips).
- Use resource-based views to analyze **task execution sequences** for each machine across jobs.
- Generate process maps with task frequencies and transitions to highlight **commonly occurring flow paths** per job type.

This provides a factual model, unlike theoretical routing assumptions.

### b) Key Performance Metrics & Process Mining Techniques

| Metric                                  | Process Mining Method                         | Data Needed                                     | Insight Generated |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Job Flow Time & Lead Time**          | Variant analysis + performance summary         | Job release, task end (final task), due date   | Distribution of job durations, Lateness |
| **Task Waiting/Queue Times**           | Perform sojourn/waiting time analysis           | ‘Queue Entry’ to ‘Setup Start’ timestamps      | Identify high-wait areas, sources of WIP |
| **Machine/Operator Utilization**       | Resource-centric performance maps               | Task execution timestamps, setup/start/end     | % time productive/setup/idle per machine |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times**     | Transition analysis per resource                | Setup Start & End, prior job ID per machine    | Compute setup time matrix: job_i  job_j |
| **Schedule Adherence/Tardiness**       | Conformance checking                           | Task actual end time, job due date             | Measure lateness distribution, % tardy |
| **Disruption Impacts**                 | Temporal drift & correlation analysis          | Breakdown logs, hot job events, downstream delays | Estimate ripple effects of disruptions |

We can also visualize historical **resource Gantt charts** to see overlapping, idle, and overloaded periods per machine/operator.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Process mining helps detect structural and behavioral inefficiencies that the current local-rule based approach fails to handle.

### a) Bottlenecks & Imbalanced Resource Utilization

- **Bottleneck analysis**: Identify machines with the highest cumulative task waiting queues and highest setup times.
- Use **process bottleneck detection trees** to see congestion caused by preceding task delays.
- **Utilization deviation**: Highlight overloaded (e.g., MILL-03) vs. starved (e.g., LATH-02) machines. **Setup-heavy machines** may have low productive time even if fully occupied.

> Insight: A resource that’s “busy but unproductive” due to excessive setup is an invisible bottleneck under current rules.

### b) Ineffective Job Prioritization

- **Variant comparison**: Contrast execution paths and timings of similar jobs with different priorities (e.g., JOB-7005 vs. JOB-7001).
- Show, e.g., that high-priority jobs do not overtake low-priority ones due to static FCFS rules  priority inversion.

### c) Suboptimal Sequencing and Setup Inefficiencies

- From **derived setup time transition matrices**, identify:
    - Sequences with high average setup duration.
    - Frequency of setup-intensive transitions across machines (e.g., ALLOY-A  ALLOY-C takes 30min vs. same alloy being 5min).

- Analyze average productivity between setups; low values indicate **ineffective sequencing**.

### d) WIP Bullwhip and Blocking

- Use **queue evolution visualization** over time per resource:
    - Amplified queues downstream of bottleneck machines show **starvation/batching**.
    - Reconstruct **token-based replay simulations** to see WIP accumulation over time.

### e) Effects of Breakdowns & Hot Jobs

- **Temporal drift detection** pre- and post-breakdown events.
- Highlight **delays in downstream machines** (longer queues post breakdown).
- Identify **rescheduling inefficiencies** for urgent jobs injected into the queue without real-time prioritization.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

Once the “symptoms” are detected, determining why they occur is key. We classify root causes into planning/scheduling inaccuracies, execution model limitations, and disruption mismanagement.

### a) Static Dispatching Rules in a Turbulent Environment

- FCFS/EDD do not account for:
    - Setup state of machines.
    - Task dependencies or inter-resource constraints.
    - Current shop floor status (e.g., queue lengths).
- Result: Non-optimal sequencing (non-setup minimizing), poor prioritization handling.

> Process mining reveals frequent overtime/high-makespan situations even when WIP is low  rule misapplication.

### b) Lack of Real-Time Visibility

- Without real-time job tracking:
    - Hot jobs can’t be injected promptly.
    - Machines may idle despite jobs being ready.
    - Dispatching doesn’t reprioritize based on current status.

> Evidence: Process conformance drift post-hot job or breakdown events.

### c) Inaccurate Duration Estimates

- Analyze:
    - Actual vs. planned duration histograms.
    - Variability clustering by job type/operator.

> High standard deviation in actual vs. planned = forecasting inaccuracy  causes misallocation and missed due dates.

### d) Poor Setup Awareness

- Setup planning is disconnected.
- No optimization to batch similar jobs or minimize matrix costs.

> Setup matrix mining reveals frequent high-cost transitions  prior job ignored in scheduling.

### e) Inadequate Disruption Response

- No rescheduling logic upon:
    - Urgent jobs (reactive rather than predictive).
    - Breakdowns (no alternate routing or resource load-sharing).

> Downstream delay events correlate highly with unhandled breakdowns  clear impact.

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

Below are three integrated strategies grounded in mined insights and adapted to the dynamics at Precision Parts Inc.

---

### Strategy 1: Adaptive Multi-Factor Dispatching Rules

#### Core Logic:
Dynamic dispatching logic that considers:

- Earliest Due Date Slack: Time remaining before due date minus estimated remaining processing time.
- Estimated Setup Time (from mined sequence-dependent matrix): Favor jobs requiring shorter setup if switching from current state.
- Job Priority (High, Medium, Low).
- Downstream Resource Load: Detect downstream bottlenecks and prioritize feeding them.

Weighted Scoring Formula at Dispatching Point:

```plaintext
Job Score = *(1/SlackTime) + *(1/EstimatedSetupTime) + *(Priority Weight) + *(Downstream Load Factor)
```

Weights (, , , ) are tuned via simulation.

#### Process Mining Dependency:
- Extract slack time dynamically based on mined average processing durations per task.
- Setup Time Matrix derived from historical job transitions on each machine.
- Downstream load/signal delay inferred from queue analysis at next resource step.

#### Pathologies Addressed:
- Poor prioritization.
- Sequence-unaware dispatching.
- Starvation or overfeeding of dependent resources.

#### Expected Impact:
- Lower setup-induced idle time.
- Better handling of urgent orders.
- Reduced WIP and smoother throughput flow.

---

### Strategy 2: Predictive Planning with Lead Time Forecasting and Disruption Simulation

#### Core Logic:
Use machine learning (e.g., XGBoost regressors or time-series models) on historical MES logs to predict:

- Job-level lead times based on:
    - Job complexity (routing length, task type).
    - Operator assignment.
    - Setup times (historical averages).
- Task-level delay risk based on current WIP levels/blockages.

Incorporate predictive analytics into proactive scheduling:
- Alert planners to jobs at risk of lateness.
- Predict potential clashes at bottleneck machines.
- Simulate impact of urgent jobs before acceptance.

#### Process Mining Dependency:
- Extract feature sets for predictive models from:
    - Duration distributions per task-resource.
    - Breakdown frequencies and MTTR (mean time to repair).
    - Historical delay patterns following hot job insertions.

#### Pathologies Addressed:
- Unpredictable lead times.
- Lack of foresight for jobs at risk of delay.
- Inflexibility in handling disruptions.

#### Expected Impact:
- Enables proactive buffer insertion.
- Improved commitment accuracy.
- Fewer surprises due to better understanding of delay propagation.

---

### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization via Intelligent Sequencing and Batching

#### Core Logic:
- Cluster jobs by setup-dominant attributes (e.g., material, part family).
- At bottleneck machines, construct daily schedules optimized for minimal transition cost using:
    - Job setup matrix as input.
    - Solve sequencing via Traveling Salesman heuristics (sequence = job order, cost = setup time).
- Introduce “setup windows” to group similar jobs for batching.

If breakdown occurs, reprioritize to batch setup-compatible jobs for when the resource returns online.

#### Process Mining Dependency:
- Build sequence-dependent setup matrix per machine.
- Identify “frequent sub-optimal sequences” from execution logs.
- Measure frequency and idle periods caused by long setup transitions.

#### Pathologies Addressed:
- Excessive setup times due to sequencing.
- Low machine productivity.
- Unstable task times due to unpredictable setup lengths.

#### Expected Impact:
- Shorter cumulative setup times.
- Smoother throughput on constrained machines.
- Higher effective utilization.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

To avoid live deployment risks, we use discrete-event simulation (DES) informed by mined data.

### a) Simulation-Based Evaluation

Create a simulation model of the shop floor, using:

- Task duration distributions (probabilistic, from mined actuals).
- Setup times from derived sequences.
- Job arrival patterns (mined interarrival times).
- Breakdown behavior (frequency × impact from logs).
- Routing variability (variants from mined paths).

#### Test Scenarios:

- High job load with mix of priorities.
- Frequent machine breakdowns.
- Influx of urgent (hot) jobs.
- Sudden shift in order mix (more complex routings).

Evaluate KPIs:

- Tardiness (% and average).
- WIP levels across time.
- Resource utilization (per type).
- Setup Time Totals and Transitions.

#### Comparison:
Baseline scheduling logic vs. Strategies 1–3 individually and in combination.

> Example: Strategy 3 may show lower setup time but slightly higher WIP. Strategy 1 might provide a good balance. Combine for synergistic effect.

### b) Continuous Monitoring Framework

Introduce a feedback loop using automated process mining with monthly log extraction:

1. **KPI Tracking Dashboard**:
   - Automated graphs for: Tardiness, WIP trends, cycle time, utilization shifts.

2. **Anomaly/Drift Detection**:
   - Use drift detection algorithms (e.g., DFG difference, process variant comparison) to detect deviation from expected flows or timing shifts.

3. **Triggering Logic Update**:
   - If setup time averages change (e.g., new operators, materials), auto-trigger re-mining of setup matrix.
   - Schedule logic re-evaluation if tardiness exceeds threshold in 3 consecutive weeks.

4. **Learning & Re-Parameterization**:
   - Apply reinforcement learning (e.g., adjust dispatch weights , , ,  via reward feedback).
