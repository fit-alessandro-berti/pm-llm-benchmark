Sure, I can provide an example of a temporal profile for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. This process might include the following activities:

1. Purchase Order Creation (POC)
2. Purchase Order Approval (POA)
3. Goods Receipt (GR)
4. Invoice Receipt (IR)
5. Invoice Approval (IA)
6. Payment

Here's a hypothetical temporal profile:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('POC', 'POA'): (1200, 180),  # 1200 seconds (20 minutes) average time, 180 seconds (3 minutes) standard deviation
    ('POA', 'GR'): (72000, 3600),  # 72000 seconds (20 hours) average time, 3600 seconds (1 hour) standard deviation
    ('GR', 'IR'): (43200, 7200),  # 43200 seconds (12 hours) average time, 7200 seconds (2 hours) standard deviation
    ('IR', 'IA'): (3600, 900),    # 3600 seconds (1 hour) average time, 900 seconds (15 minutes) standard deviation
    ('IA', 'Payment'): (28800, 4800)  # 28800 seconds (8 hours) average time, 4800 seconds (1.33 hours) standard deviation
}
```
