Okay, let me start by understanding the normative process first. The process starts with receiving an order. Then it checks inventory. Depending on whether there's enough stock, two paths are possible: either proceed normally (check inventory -> authorize payment -> package -> ship -> close) or cancel (check inventory -> cancel -> close). 

Looking at Case 1: It follows the normal path perfectly. Receive, check, authorize, package, ship, close in order. No issues here.

Case 2 seems to have a problem because after checking inventory, they package items first before authorizing payment. According to the description, authorization should come before packaging. That's a violation here. 

Case 3: After canceling the order, they shipped it anyway? The normative process says shipping shouldn't happen after cancellation. This is definitely a violation.

Case 4 follows the cancellation path correctly—after checking inventory and finding insufficient stock, they cancel and then close. No issues here.

Case 5 skips authorizing payment altogether. The description states that authorization must be done before packaging and shipping. Since they went straight to ship order without authorizing payment first, this is a violation as well.

**Identified Violations:**

1. **Case 2:** 
   - *Violation:* Activities are out of proper sequence
   - *Explanation:* According to the normative process, after checking inventory, payment authorization must precede packaging items. However, Case 2 shows "Package items" happening before "Authorize payment," which directly violates this rule.

2. **Case 3:**
   - *Violation:* Shipping occurs after cancellation
   - *Explanation:* The normative description explicitly states that shipping should never occur after an order has been canceled ("Ship order... should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation"). Yet Case 3 shows "Ship order" happening after "Cancel order," which is clearly against the process rules.

3. **Case 5:**
   - *Violation:* Missing required payment authorization
   - *Explanation:* The normative description requires that payment be authorized before items can be shipped or packaged ("Authorize payment... should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging"). Case 5 skips this crucial step entirely, proceeding directly from checking inventory to shipping, which violates the established process flow.

**Cases Without Violations:**
- **Case 1:** Follows the normal process path correctly (receive  check  authorize  package  ship  close)
- **Case 4:** Properly follows the cancellation branch (receive  check  cancel  close)
