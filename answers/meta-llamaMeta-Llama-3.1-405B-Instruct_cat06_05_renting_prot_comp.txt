Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies, I've identified some key differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups. Please note that my analysis assumes that the process variants are related to a rental property application and tenant management process.

**Main differences:**

1. **Rejected applications:** The unprotected group has a higher frequency of rejected applications, particularly in the process variants that involve extensive screening (1022 vs. 793). This might indicate a bias towards rejecting applicants from the unprotected group.
2. **Opportunity for extensive screening:** The unprotected group has more opportunities for extensive screening (1022 + 44 + 43 = 1109) compared to the protected group (793 + 29 + 14 = 836). This could imply that the unprotected group is subject to more thorough vetting, potentially leading to a higher rejection rate.
3. **Tenant eviction:** The unprotected group has a process variant involving tenant eviction (not present in the protected group). Although the frequency is low (6), this might suggest a bias towards stricter enforcement of rental agreements for the unprotected group.
4. **Successful applications:** The unprotected group has a higher frequency of successful applications, particularly in process variants involving multiple rent payments (e.g., 268 vs. 29 for "Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment"). This might indicate a bias towards accepting applicants from the unprotected group who demonstrate a stable payment history.
5. **Contract signing and move-in:** The unprotected group has a higher frequency of contract signing and move-in process variants (e.g., 268 + 223 + 156 = 647 vs. 29 + 23 + 18 = 70). This could suggest a bias towards faster processing or more efficient onboarding for the unprotected group.

**Additional observations:**

* Both groups have a similar overall structure in their process variants, indicating that the underlying business process is similar.
* The protected group has fewer process variants with high frequencies (>100), which might indicate a more streamlined or efficient process for this group.

**Caution:** These observations are based on a simplified analysis of the provided data and should be interpreted with caution. A more thorough investigation would involve considering additional factors, such as the demographics and characteristics of the protected and unprotected groups, to determine whether any observed differences are statistically significant and indicative of bias.
