We are given a Windows activity system log. Each line has a timestamp, action type, and attributes including application name and window title.

Steps to transform into a process mining event log:

1. **Data Transformation**: Convert each raw event into an event log entry.
2. **Case Identification**: Group events into cases. Each case represents a logical unit of work (e.g., editing a document, handling an email). We need to infer cases by looking at sequences of events and the application/window context.
3. **Activity Naming**: Assign meaningful activity names (e.g., "Editing Document", "Sending Email") rather than using the raw action type.
4. **Attributes**: Each event must have:
   - Case ID: A unique identifier per case.
   - Activity Name: The higher-level activity.
   - Timestamp: The original timestamp.
   - We can also include: Activity subtype (if needed), Application, Window, etc. but the problem states at least Case ID, Activity Name, and Timestamp.

How to group events into cases?
- We can group by the application and window? But note: the same document might be opened in two different windows? Also, the user switches between applications.
- Alternatively, we can group by a session that involves a set of events in the same application and a common purpose? However, the log doesn't explicitly have a session ID.

Observation: The log shows events that are interleaved between applications. We need to form cases that are coherent units of work.

Approach:
- We note that the user works on a document and then switches to an email, then to a PDF, then back to Excel and Word. We need to form cases that represent a workflow for a specific goal.

But note: The log is a sequence of events. We can form cases that start when an application is opened and end when the application is closed? However, we see that the same application (like Microsoft Word) is opened and closed twice? Actually, we see two Word windows: one named "Quarterly_Report.docx" and another named "Document1.docx". Also, the same for PDF and Excel.

We can form a case per document or per work product? The problem says: "a logical unit of user work, such as editing a specific document".

Therefore, we can form a case for each document that the user edits. But note: the user also works on a PDF (Report_Draft.pdf) and on an Excel budget. However, the log shows that the same document (Quarterly_Report.docx) is opened twice? Actually, we see two distinct windows: one named "Quarterly_Report.docx" and another named "Document1.docx". Similarly, the PDF is "Report_Draft.pdf".

So, we can form a case for each distinct window? But note: the same application (Word) has two different windows. Also, the user works on two different documents in two different sessions: first Document1.docx and then later Quarterly_Report.docx (which is opened again after being closed). Also, the PDF is opened separately.

But wait: the log shows:
- First session: Word (Document1.docx) -> then switch to Chrome -> then Acrobat -> then back to Word (Document1.docx) -> then Excel -> then back to Word (Quarterly_Report.docx)

We need to form cases that might span multiple applications? The problem says: "handling a particular email" or "reviewing a certain PDF". So, we can form a case per document or per email.

However, the user's workflow might be: 
1. Working on a draft document (Document1.docx) and then switching to email to reply, then saving the email and then opening the PDF to highlight some text, then going back to Excel to update budget, then inserting a reference from the PDF? Then finally working again on the quarterly report.

But note: the log does not explicitly link the highlight in the PDF to the Excel. So we have to base on the events.

Alternatively, we can form cases per application? But that might break the narrative.

The problem says: "if multiple plausible interpretations exist, choose the one that leads to a coherent, analyst-friendly event log".

I propose to form a case for each distinct document that is being worked on, including the PDF. But note: the same PDF might be opened in two different windows? We see only one instance of the PDF.

So, we can assign:
- Case for Document1.docx: events involving that window (including when it is reopened later? but note: the log shows two separate windows with the same name? Actually, the window titles are the same? This might be the same document but in two sessions? We see the first session of Document1.docx and then later the user switches back to it. So we can consider it the same document and reuse the same case? But the log shows:

First occurrence of Document1.docx:
  2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z,FOCUS,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Document1.docx
  ... then typing, then save ...
  then switch to Chrome

Then later:
  2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Microsoft Word,FromWindow=Document1.docx,ToApp=Google Chrome,ToWindow=Email - Inbox

So the same window? Actually, the window title is different: first time it's "Document1.docx", then the next time the user comes back to Document1.docx, it's the same window? Or a different instance? The title is the same. We can assume it's the same document.

But note: the user closed the first document? The log shows a CLOSE event for the first Word document? Actually, we see:
  2024-12-11T09:07:00.000Z,FOCUS,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Quarterly_Report.docx   -> This is a new window? Because the previous one was closed? Actually, we don't see a CLOSE for Document1.docx. But we see a SWITCH from Word (Document1.docx) to Chrome. Then later, the user comes back to Document1.docx? Actually, we see:

  2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Microsoft Word,FromWindow=Document1.docx,ToApp=Google Chrome,ToWindow=Email - Inbox

This means the user was in Document1.docx and then switched to Chrome. Then after working in Chrome and Acrobat, the user switches back to Document1.docx? But wait, the next event after that switch to Chrome is:

  2024-12-11T09:04:00.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Google Chrome,FromWindow=Email - Inbox,ToApp=Adobe Acrobat,ToWindow=Report_Draft.pdf

Then after Acrobat, the user switches to Excel? Then back to Word? We see:

  2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z ... this is at 09:06:00? But the previous event is at 09:04:30? Then we see events for Acrobat and then at 09:06:00? Actually, the log is:

  2024-12-11T09:04:00.000Z ... Acrobat
  2024-12-11T09:04:30.000Z ... Acrobat (scroll)
  2024-12-11T09:04:45.000Z ... Acrobat (highlight)
  2024-12-11T09:05:00.000Z ... Excel (focus)

So there is no event at 09:06:00 for switching back to Document1.docx? Actually, we see:

  2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Microsoft Excel,FromWindow=Budget_2024.xlsx,ToApp=Microsoft Word,ToWindow=Document1.docx

So that's switching from Excel to Document1.docx? Then we see:

  2024-12-11T09:06:15.000Z ... Typing in Document1.docx
  2024-12-11T09:06:30.000Z ... Save in Document1.docx
  2024-12-11T09:07:00.000Z ... Focus on Quarterly_Report.docx (so the user closed Document1.docx? Or it was already closed by the switch to Excel? Actually, the switch from Excel to Document1.docx implies that the document was reopened.

So we have two distinct sessions for Document1.docx? The first session from 09:00:00 to 09:06:00 (but note: the switch to Chrome happens at 09:06:00? Actually, the event at 09:06:00 is a switch from Excel to Document1.docx, meaning the user reopened Document1.docx? Then worked on it until 09:07:00? Then switched to Quarterly_Report.docx.

Therefore, we can form a case for each distinct window that the user worked on? But note: the same window might be reused? Actually, the window title for the first session of Document1.docx is "Document1.docx", and the second session of Document1.docx is the same title? So we can assign the same case ID for both sessions? But that would mix two different work sessions on the same document? Or we can consider each session as a separate case? The problem says "a logical unit of user work". The two sessions on Document1.docx are separated by other activities. So we can form two cases for Document1.docx? Or we can consider the entire work on Document1.docx as one case? But the user took a break (went to email and then to PDF and then to Excel) and then came back? So it might be two separate efforts? However, without more context, we can form one case per window per session? But the problem does not specify if we should merge or split.

But note: the log does not have an explicit session ID. We are to create the log for process mining. The goal is to make it analyst-friendly.

I propose to create a case per document and per application? Actually, the same document might be opened in two different applications? No, the same document is opened in the same application. But we see the same window title appearing twice? So we can create two cases for Document1.docx? But that would be two cases with the same name? That is acceptable? Or we can use the timestamp to split the cases? Alternatively, we can use the case ID to be per document and per visit? 

Alternatively, we can form a case for each distinct work product (document, email, PDF). But note: the user works on multiple documents and emails.

Another idea: form a case for each email and each document? But the log does not explicitly mark an email as being part of a case? However, the problem says: "handling a particular email". So we can form a case per email? But we see the user sending an email? That would be one case for that email? But the case would include the entire thread? We don't have the entire thread, only one email.

Given the complexity, I propose the following:

We form a case for each distinct window that the user focused on. The window title is unique per document/email/PDF? We see:

- Microsoft Word: two windows: Document1.docx and Quarterly_Report.docx? Actually, we see Quarterly_Report.docx opened again? The first time the user worked on Quarterly_Report.docx? Actually, we see:

  First event: FOCUS on Microsoft Word, Window=Quarterly_Report.docx at 08:59:50? Then at 09:07:00, the user focuses again on Quarterly_Report.docx? So that's two sessions? But note: the first session might have been interrupted? We don't see a close event for Quarterly_Report.docx? Actually, we see the user saves it at 09:08:00? Then closes it at 09:08:15? Then in the second session, the user focuses again? So that's a new session? 

But wait: the first event for Quarterly_Report.docx is at 08:59:50? Then the user worked on it? Then switched to Document1.docx? Then later, the user switches from Excel back to Document1.docx? Then after working on Document1.docx, the user switches to Quarterly_Report.docx? Then works on it and saves and closes? 

So we have:

Case for Quarterly_Report.docx:
  First session: 08:59:50 to ...? We don't see a switch until 09:07:00? Actually, the user switched from Quarterly_Report.docx to Document1.docx at 09:06:00? Then worked on Document1.docx and then came back to Quarterly_Report.docx at 09:07:00? Then worked on it until 09:08:15? Then closed? So that's one case for Quarterly_Report.docx? But the first session was interrupted? We don't see a close? The system log does not record the close? We only have the FOCUS event at the beginning and then the user comes back? Actually, the first FOCUS event might be the opening? Then the user switched away? Then when the user comes back, it's still open? Or the system log only records focus events? 

Given the ambiguity, I propose to form a case per distinct window that appears in the log, and we assign the same case ID for the same window title? But note: the same window title might appear in two different sessions? We can use the window title as the case ID? But that would not be unique if the same document is opened twice? Actually, we see the same window title appearing at two different times? So we can use the window title as the case ID? But then we have two cases with the same ID? That is not allowed. So we need a unique identifier per case.

Alternative: We can create a case per document and per application? But the same document might be in two applications? No. So we can use a case ID that is a combination of the application and window title? But that would be per session? 

But note: the problem says "case ID: A unique identifier for the case". So we can create an arbitrary unique ID per case? But we want to be able to relate events. Alternatively, we can use the window title as the case ID? But then two windows with the same title in different sessions would have the same ID? That is acceptable if we consider it the same document? But we see the same window title in two sessions? For example, Document1.docx appears twice? So we can assign the same case ID for both sessions? That would be one case for the document? But the events are separated by other activities? 

But in process mining, we often have the same case (document) and we see events interleaved. So we can use the document name (window title for Word) as the case ID? Then we have:

Case "Document1.docx": events for the first session and the second session? But the two sessions are separated? That is acceptable? Yes, because the same document can be edited in two separate sessions.

Similarly, for Quarterly_Report.docx: we see two sessions? Actually, we see:

  First session: 08:59:50 (focus) ... then the user switches to Document1.docx at 09:00:00? Then later the user comes back to Quarterly_Report.docx at 09:07:00? So that's two sessions? But the first session was very short? We don't see any events after 08:59:50 until 09:07:00? So we can consider two sessions? But the log does not record a close and reopen? So we can assign the same case ID? 

But note: the problem says "coherent narrative". We want to explain the user's work. So we can form:

Case 1: Document1.docx - covering the two sessions? Or split into two cases? 

I think splitting might be better for analysis? Because the two sessions are separated by other work? But then the case would be: "Editing Document1 - First Session" and "Editing Document1 - Second Session". But the problem says "standardized activities", so we don't want to include the session number in the activity name? We can have one case per session? But how to identify a session? We don't have a session ID.

Given the complexity, I propose to form a case for each distinct work period? But without a clear end of session, it's hard.

Alternatively, we can form a case per document and per application? And if the same document is opened again, it's a new case? But that would break the narrative of the document. 

After reevaluating, I think the best approach is to form a case per distinct window (by application and window title) and assign a unique case ID per window? But note: the same window might be reused? We see the same window title in two sessions? We can use the window title and the application to form a unique key? But the problem says case ID should be unique per case? So we can use a unique number per case? And we can name the case by the window title? And we assume that the same window title in two different sessions is the same window? Even if there is a long gap? That is a common scenario in document editing.

So I decide:

- Case ID: a unique number (starting from 1) and we can name the case by the window title? But we have two different documents with the same name? We see two Word windows: Document1.docx and Quarterly_Report.docx? And then a PDF? So we have three distinct windows? Actually, we see:

  Word: Document1.docx (first session) and then later Document1.docx (second session) -> same case? 
  Word: Quarterly_Report.docx (first session) and then later Quarterly_Report.docx (second session) -> same case? 
  Adobe Acrobat: Report_Draft.pdf -> one case
  Microsoft Excel: Budget_2024.xlsx -> one case
  Microsoft Word: two sessions for Document1.docx and one session for Quarterly_Report.docx? Actually, we see:

  Word: 
    Case1: Document1.docx (events from 2024-12-11T09:00:00 to 2024-12-11T09:06:00 and then later from 09:07:00? Actually, the second session for Document1.docx is at 09:07:00? But note: the first event for Quarterly_Report.docx is at 08:59:50? Then the user works on Quarterly_Report.docx? Then switches to Document1.docx? Then later comes back to Document1.docx? Then later switches to Quarterly_Report.docx? Then works on it? 

  So we have:

  Case1: Document1.docx (first session: 09:00:00 to 09:06:00) and then the user reopens Document1.docx at 09:07:00? Actually, the event at 09:07:00 is a focus on Quarterly_Report.docx? Then at 09:07:45, the user starts typing in Quarterly_Report.docx? So that's a new case for Quarterly_Report.docx? Then the user works on it until 09:08:15? Then closes? Then the user focuses on Quarterly_Report.docx again? Actually, we don't see that? We see the user focus on Quarterly_Report.docx at 09:07:00 and then at 09:08:15, the user closes the document? Then the log ends? 

  Actually, the last event for Quarterly_Report.docx is the save event at 09:08:00? Then at 09:08:15, there is a CLOSE event? Then the user focuses on Quarterly_Report.docx again? No, we see:

  2024-12-11T09:08:15.000Z,CLOSE,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Quarterly_Report.docx

  Then nothing else? So that's the end of the case for Quarterly_Report.docx.

  And for Document1.docx: the first session ends with the switch to Excel? Then the second session for Document1.docx starts with a switch from Excel to Document1.docx? Then the user types and saves? Then at 09:07:00, the user focuses on Quarterly_Report.docx? So we have two cases for Document1.docx? Actually, we see two distinct sessions for Document1.docx? But the same window title? So we can assign the same case ID? But that would be two sessions? We can either:

  Option A: Merge the two sessions for Document1.docx into one case? But they are separated by other cases? 
  Option B: Split into two cases: one for each session? 

  The problem says: "a logical unit of user work". The two sessions on Document1.docx might be considered as one case? Because it's the same document? But the user took a break and worked on other things? In process mining, we often have continuity. 

  I think the best is to create one case per window per day? But we don't have the day? 

  Given the time, I propose to create a case for each distinct event sequence that forms a coherent work period? But without clear boundaries, it's hard.

  Alternative approach: We can create a case per application? But that would break the document narrative.

  After careful thought, I decide to create a case for each distinct window (application and window title) and assign a unique case ID. For the same window title that appears in two sessions, we assign two separate cases? But then the case would be: "Editing Document1.docx (First Session)" and "Editing Document1.docx (Second Session)". But the problem says to use standardized activity names? So we can have:

  Case ID: CASE_Word_Document1_1, Case ID: CASE_Word_Document1_2

  But that is not elegant.

  Another idea: We can use the first event of the session to form the case? And then the next events in the same window are part of the same case? But when the window is closed and reopened, it's a new case? The log does not show close events? So we cannot rely on close events.

  Given the above, I will form a case for each distinct event in the same application and window? But that would create one event per case? That is not useful.

  I think the most common approach in process mining for this scenario is to use the document as the case. So we create one case per document and one case per email and one case per PDF? But we see multiple documents? So:

  - Case for Document1.docx: covering both sessions? But how to represent the two sessions? We can have two separate cases for the same document? Or we can have one case and then the events are interleaved? 

  I found a solution: We can create a case per document and per version? But we don't have version information.

  Given the time, I will form a case per window (application and window title) and if the same window title appears again later, it's a new case? Even if there is a long gap? This is because the window might be closed and reopened? The log does not show close events? So we assume that every focus event is a new session? But that is not true? Focus event means the window was already open? 

  According to the log, the focus event is recorded when the user focuses on a window that is already open? So the first focus event for a window might be the only time the window is opened? Then the window remains open until the user closes it? But we don't see close events? So we cannot rely on that.

  Given the above, I will create one case per window (application and window title) and assign the same case ID for the same window title regardless of the time? And then the activities are the events that happened in that window? Even if there is a long gap? This is the approach taken in many process mining logs.

  So we will have:

  Case1: Window=Document1.docx (in Microsoft Word) -> events:
      2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z,FOCUS,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Document1.docx
      ... typing events for Document1.docx
      2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Microsoft Word,FromWindow=Document1.docx,ToApp=Google Chrome,ToWindow=Email - Inbox

  Then later, when the user comes back to Document1.docx, we create a new case? Or reuse the same case ID? We see:

      2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Microsoft Excel,FromWindow=Budget_2024.xlsx,ToApp=Microsoft Word,ToWindow=Document1.docx   -> This is a switch to Document1.docx? But note: the previous session of Document1.docx was already closed? Or it was still open? We don't know. But the window title is the same? So we reuse the case? 

  But the event at 09:06:00 is a switch from Excel to Document1.docx? This suggests that the window Document1.docx was already open? Or it was reopened? We cannot tell. 

  I will reuse the same case ID for the same window title? So Case1: Document1.docx covers both the first and the second session? And the events are in chronological order? But then the events are not in the same case? They are interleaved with other cases? 

  In process mining, we create a case per instance, and the instance is identified by the document and the session? But we don't have session information.

  Given the above, I will create one case per distinct window (application and window title) and assign a unique case ID. The activities are the events that occurred in that window, regardless of when they occurred. This means that the first session of Document1.docx and the second session are in the same case? But then the events from the first session of Document1.docx and the second session are not in chronological order in the case? They are mixed with events from other applications? 

  This is not desirable because the event log should be in chronological order? But process mining logs are usually stored in chronological order per case? So we will have one case with multiple events in chronological order? But the events in the case are not contiguous in time? They are sorted by time? But the case will have events from different times? That is acceptable in process mining? Yes, process mining logs often have events from different times for the same case.

  Therefore, I will form a case for each unique (application, window) pair. The case ID will be a unique number (e.g., based on the window title and application) but we can simply assign an incrementing ID.

  Steps:

  - Identify each unique (app, window) as a case.
  - For each event, if the event's application and window matches a case, put it in that case. Otherwise, create a new case.

  Then, for activity naming, we will translate the raw action type to a higher-level activity. We will group related actions. For example:

    FOCUS -> "Editing Document"
    TYPING -> "Editing Document"
    SAVE -> "Saving"
    SWITCH -> "Switching Application"
    CLICK -> "Clicking"
    SCROLL -> "Scrolling"
    HIGHLIGHT -> "Highlighting"

  But we need to be consistent. We can define:

    - FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, CLICK (when in the context of the document or email) -> "Editing"
    - SAVE -> "Saving"
    - SWITCH -> "Switching Application"
    - CLICK (on an email) -> "Reading Email" or "Replying to Email"
    - SCROLL -> "Scrolling in Email"
    - HIGHLIGHT -> "Highlighting in PDF"

  So we will create activity names that are:

    - Editing: for FOCUS, TYPING in a document or email? But note: we have Excel as well? We can have "Editing Spreadsheet" for Excel.

  We can do:

    - For Word, Document1.docx: 
          FOCUS, TYPING -> "Editing Document"
          SAVE -> "Saving Document"

    - For Email in Chrome:
          CLICK with Action=Open Email -> "Reading Email: Opening"
          SCROLL -> "Scrolling in Email"
          CLICK with Action=Reply to Email -> "Replying to Email"
          CLICK with Action=Send Email -> "Sending Email"

    - For PDF in Acrobat:
          SCROLL -> "Scrolling in PDF"
          HIGHLIGHT -> "Highlighting in PDF"

    - For Excel:
          FOCUS, TYPING -> "Editing Spreadsheet"
          SAVE -> "Saving Spreadsheet"

  But note: the user also did a SWITCH event? That is not an activity by itself? We can omit SWITCH because it's a transition.

  Also, the CLOSE event? We can create an activity for "Closing Application".

  But the problem says: "Each event in the final log should correspond to a meaningful activity". The SWITCH event is just a transition between applications and doesn't represent an activity? So we can skip it? Or we can create an activity for switching? But that would be very short. 

  Alternatively, we can include the SWITCH in the activity name? For example:

    - SWITCH from AppA to AppB -> "Switching to Application B"

  But the problem says "meaningful", so we can do that.

  However, the user also has activities in between? Like opening an email? So the SWITCH event alone might not be meaningful? But it is part of the workflow.

  Given the above, I will include the SWITCH event in the activity name? But then we have:

    - Event: SWITCH, ... -> "Switching to Google Chrome"

  But note: the log provides the FromApp and ToApp, so we can use that in the activity name.

  Proposed activity naming:

    FOCUS -> "Editing [Window]"
    TYPING -> "Editing [Window]"
    SAVE -> "Saving [Window]"
    SWITCH -> "Switching to [ToApp]"
    CLICK -> "Clicking on [Action]"
    SCROLL -> "Scrolling in [App]"
    HIGHLIGHT -> "Highlighting text in [App]"

  But we want generic activity names? The problem says "standardized activity names". So we can drop the window title? Or keep it as part of the case name? The case name is already the window title? So in the activity name, we can omit the window title? 

  We can do:

    - Editing Document
    - Editing Spreadsheet
    - Editing PDF
    - Switching to [ToApp]
    - Clicking on [Action]
    - Scrolling in [App]
    - Highlighting text in [App]

  But then we lose the context of the document? But the case name is the window title? So the analyst is familiar with the context.

  Alternatively, we can include the window title in the activity name? But that might be redundant? 

  I think it's better to omit because the case name is already the window title? And the activity name is the type of action.

  Steps for the event log:

  - Create a case for each unique (app, window) pair.
  - For each event in that case, assign an activity name based on the action type and the context (which application and window).

  Example for the first event:

    Timestamp: 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z
    Action: FOCUS
    App: Microsoft Word
    Window: Quarterly_Report.docx
    Activity: Editing Document

  Example for the second event:

    Timestamp: 2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z
    Action: FOCUS
    App: Microsoft Word
    Window: Document1.docx
    Activity: Editing Document

  Example for the third event:

    Timestamp: 2024-12-11T09:00:30.000Z
    Action: TYPING
    App: Microsoft Word
    Window: Document1.docx
    Activity: Editing Document

  And so on.

  We also see a SWITCH event:

    Timestamp: 2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z
    Action: SWITCH
    App: Microsoft Excel
    Window: Budget_2024.xlsx
    FromApp: Microsoft Excel
    FromWindow: Budget_2024.xlsx
    ToApp: Microsoft Word
    ToWindow: Document1.docx
    Activity: Switching to Microsoft Word

  But note: the event has the action type "SWITCH", and we have the FromApp, ToApp.

  We will derive the activity name from the action type and the relevant attributes (app, window) but without being too verbose.

  Proposed activity names:

    - FOCUS, TYPING: "Editing"
    - SAVE: "Saving"
    - CLICK: "Clicking" [but we have an Action in the event? So we can include the action in the activity name? For email, we have specific actions: Opening, Replying, etc.]
    - SCROLL: "Scrolling"
    - HIGHLIGHT: "Highlighting"
    - SWITCH: "Switching to [ToApp]"

  But for CLICK on an email with Action=Open Email, we can have "Opening Email".

  However, the log provides the Action for CLICK? Yes: the event has "Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting". So we can use that.

  So for CLICK:

    - If the app is Google Chrome and the action is about an email, then "Opening Email"
    - If the app is Microsoft Word, then "Clicking" (but we might not have context? Unless we know the window title? But we are not including window title in activity name) -> we can use "Clicking" generally? But then it's not specific.

  Given the complexity, I will use the following mapping:

    - FOCUS: "Editing"
    - TYPING: "Editing"
    - SAVE: "Saving"
    - CLICK: 
          - If the app is Google Chrome and the action is one of the email actions (Open Email, Reply to Email, Send Email), then use the specific action name (e.g., "Opening Email", "Replying to Email", "Sending Email")
          - Otherwise: "Clicking"
    - SCROLL: "Scrolling"
    - HIGHLIGHT: "Highlighting text"
    - SWITCH: "Switching to {ToApp}"

  But note: the event for CLICK also has the window title? But we are not including it in the activity name? We can if we want? But the problem says standardized activities? So we want consistent names? So maybe not.

  Alternatively, we can be more context-aware by including the application in the activity name? For example, for Chrome email: "Email: Opening" and for Word: "Email: Clicking in the email list"? But that is not standardized.

  Given the trade-off, I will use:

    - For CLICK in Google Chrome during the email session: use the specific action (Opening Email, Replying, etc.)
    - For other CLICK events, use "Clicking"

  But then the activity names are not standardized? We can do:

    - Always use the specific action when available? But for a Word document, we only have "Clicking" and we don't know what the click was for? So we use "Clicking".

  We can also create a category for email and for document? But then we lose the specific action.

  I think it's better to have standardized names without specific context? But then we lose information.

  Given the instructions: "standardized activities rather than keeping the raw action verbs", we should avoid specific actions like "Opening Email" because that is application-specific? Instead, we can use:

    - "Interacting with email" for click in the email list? But we don't have that information.

  The log provides the action type and for CLICK in Chrome email, it's "Action=Open Email", so we can use that in the activity name? But then the activity name would be "Open Email" for that specific click? But that is not a standard activity name? It's too specific.

  I think the best is to use:

    - For CLICK: 
          - If the event has an "Action" in the log (which it does for some clicks) and the action is one of a few known ones, then use a standardized action name (e.g., "Opening Email", "Replying to Email", "Sending Email")
          - Otherwise, use "Clicking".

  Similarly, for other events.

  Let's define the activity names as follows:

    - FOCUS: "Editing document"
    - TYPING: "Editing document"
    - SAVE: "Saving document"
    - CLICK: 
        - If the event has an "Action" and the Action is one of: "Open Email", "Reply to Email", "Send Email", then use that as the activity name.
        - Otherwise, use "Clicking"
    - SCROLL: "Scrolling in application"
    - HIGHLIGHT: "Highlighting text"
    - SWITCH: "Switching to application"

  But then we lose the window title? But the case name is the window title? So it's okay.

  However, for SCROLL and HIGHLIGHT, we can be more specific? 

    - SCROLL: "Scrolling in [App]" -> but we want standardized, so we can use "Scrolling"
    - HIGHLIGHT: "Highlighting text"

  And for the email clicks, we can have:

    - "Opening Email", "Replying to Email", "Sending Email"

  But note: the user also has a CLICK with Action="Meeting details confirmed" -> that is the last click before sending? We can map that to "Sending Email" because the action is part of composing the email? Or we can use "Confirming email details"? But that is not in the log.

  Given the above, I will use the available information.

  Now, let's build the event log.

  We will create a table with columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp.

  How to number the cases? We will create a case per (app, window) pair. We can use the window title and app as a key? But we need a unique ID. We can assign an integer ID per case.

  Steps:

  - Create a set of unique (app, window) pairs from the log.
  - Assign an ID to each pair (e.g., starting from 1).
  - For each event, determine the case ID by the (app, window) of the event.
  - Then, assign the activity name based on the action type and attributes.

  Unique (app, window) pairs in the log:

  1. (Microsoft Word, Quarterly_Report.docx)
  2. (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx)   [first session]
  3. (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx)   [second session] -> but same as above? We are not creating separate cases? We are using the same case ID for both sessions? Yes, because the window title and app are the same? But wait, the two sessions are separated? We will have two sets of events for the same case? That is acceptable? Yes, because the case represents the document, and the events are in chronological order within the case.

  But note: the first event for (Microsoft Word, Quarterly_Report.docx) is at 08:59:50, then the next event for this case is at 09:07:00? Then the events in between are for other cases? That is fine.

  However, we see only one (Microsoft Word, Quarterly_Report.docx) case? And two (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx) cases? But the two (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx) events are not consecutive in time? We will put them in the same case? Or separate cases? 

  We are using the (app, window) pair as the key. The two sessions of Document1.docx have the same key? So they are the same case? Then the events for the first session and the second session are in the same case? But they are not contiguous in the log? That is acceptable in process mining? Yes, the event log can have events from the same case interleaved with other cases.

  But in the log, between the first session of Document1.docx and the second session, there are events for other cases (Chrome email, Acrobat, Excel). Then the second session of Document1.docx appears. So in the event log for the case Document1.docx, the events will be:

      Event1: first session events (09:00:00 to 09:06:00)
      Event2: events from other cases that happened in between? No, we are grouping by case, so the event log for Document1.docx will have all events that occurred in that window, regardless of when they occurred? But then the events are out of order? 

  This is a problem: the event log should be in chronological order? But if we group by case, the events for a case are not contiguous? And we want to preserve the time order? 

  Therefore, we must not group events by case arbitrarily. We must preserve the time order. The standard in process mining is to have the event log in chronological order, and each event belongs to a case. So we cannot put all events of the same case together? We must sort by timestamp and assign each event to its case.

  The approach is:

      - For each event, determine its case ID (by (app, window)).
      - Then, in the event log, sort by timestamp (and then by case ID within the same timestamp? but timestamp may not be unique).

  So the event log will have:

      Timestamp, CaseID, ActivityName

  and the events will be sorted by timestamp.

  Therefore, the two sessions of Document1.docx will be in the same case? But then the events are not contiguous? That is fine.

  Now, let's list the unique (app, window) pairs and assign case IDs:

  Case 1: (Microsoft Word, Quarterly_Report.docx)
  Case 2: (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx)
  Case 3: (Google Chrome, Email - Inbox)
  Case 4: (Adobe Acrobat, Report_Draft.pdf)
  Case 5: (Microsoft Excel, Budget_2024.xlsx)

  But wait, the log has:

      Microsoft Word, Quarterly_Report.docx -> case1
      Microsoft Word, Document1.docx -> case2
      Google Chrome, Email - Inbox -> case3
      Adobe Acrobat, Report_Draft.pdf -> case4
      Microsoft Excel, Budget_2024.xlsx -> case5

  And then we see another (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx) -> case2
  and (Microsoft Word, Quarterly_Report.docx) -> case1

  So we have 5 cases.

  Now, let's process each event:

  Event1: 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z,FOCUS,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Quarterly_Report.docx -> case1, activity: "Editing document"
  Event2: 2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z,FOCUS,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Document1.docx -> case2, activity: "Editing document"
  Event3: 2024-12-11T09:00:30.000Z,TYPING,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Document1.docx,Keys=Draft intro paragraph -> case2, activity: "Editing document"
  Event4: 2024-12-11T09:01:00.000Z,TYPING,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Document1.docx,Keys=Additional details here -> case2, activity: "Editing document"
  Event5: 2024-12-11T09:01:15.000Z,SAVE,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Document1.docx -> case2, activity: "Saving document"
  Event6: 2024-12-11T09:01:45.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Microsoft Word,FromWindow=Document1.docx,ToApp=Google Chrome,ToWindow=Email - Inbox -> case3, activity: "Switching to Google Chrome"
  Event7: 2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z,CLICK,App=Google Chrome,Window=Email - Inbox,Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting -> case3, activity: "Opening Email"
  Event8: 2024-12-11T09:02:30.000Z,SCROLL,App=Google Chrome,Window=Email - Inbox,Direction=Down -> case3, activity: "Scrolling"
  Event9: 2024-12-11T09:02:45.000Z,CLICK,App=Google Chrome,Window=Email - Inbox,Action=Reply to Email -> case3, activity: "Replying to Email"
  Event10: 2024-12-11T09:03:00.000Z,TYPING,App=Google Chrome,Window=Email - Inbox,Keys=Meeting details confirmed -> case3, activity: "Clicking" (because the action is not one of the specific ones? But wait, the action is part of the reply? But we don't have a specific action for "Confirming email details", so we use "Clicking")
        However, note: the event has an action type "TYPING", so we can use "Typing in email"? But we decided to use "Clicking" for this? But the action type is TYPING? This is a conflict.

  Let me re-evaluate the event10: 
      Action type: TYPING
      App: Google Chrome
      Window: Email - Inbox
      Keys: Meeting details confirmed

  This is typing? So should be "Editing document" (but in the email)? But our activity for TYPING is "Editing document". But the email is not a document? But we are using "Editing document" for both Word and email? We can change the activity name for email to "Editing email"? 

  We can do:

      - For email in Chrome: use "Editing email"

  So:

      FOCUS on email -> "Editing email"
      TYPING in email -> "Editing email"
      etc.

  But then we have to be consistent.

  Given the above, I will change the activity names to be:

      - For any app that is an email client (Google Chrome, Microsoft Excel as an email client? But Excel is not typically an email client) -> only Chrome for email? 
      - We can create a activity name for email? But the problem says "standardized", so we can have:

          - "Editing document" for Word and for email? But email is not a document? Or we can have:
          - "Editing document" for both? Or differentiate.

  I think it's better to have:

      - Word: "Editing Document"
      - Excel: "Editing Spreadsheet"
      - Acrobat: "Editing PDF"
      - Email in Chrome: "Editing Email"

  Then:

      FOCUS on email -> "Editing Email"
      TYPING in email -> "Editing Email"
      SAVE in email -> "Saving Email"
      CLICK in email -> "Clicking in Email" or if specific action, then specific.

  But then the activity names are not standardized across applications? The problem says "standardized", meaning the same activity name should appear for the same type of activity across cases? Then we cannot use "Editing Document" for email? 

  Given the instructions, I think we should use:

      - Editing: for typing and focusing in any document or email? But then we lose the specific type.

  Alternatively, we can use hierarchical naming:

      - Application: Activity

  Example:

      - Microsoft Word: Editing
      - Microsoft Excel: Editing
      - Adobe Acrobat: Editing PDF
      - Google Chrome (email): Editing Email

  Then the activity name would be:

      - FOCUS: "Editing"
      - TYPING: "Editing"
      - SAVE: "Saving"
      - CLICK: "Clicking" (and if we have specific action, then use that within the "Clicking" activity? But the problem says the event should correspond to a meaningful activity? So we can have "Clicking" as a activity? And then more specific ones are not defined? 

  Given the time, I will use the following for activity names:

      - FOCUS: "Focus"
      - TYPING: "Type"
      - SAVE: "Save"
      - CLICK: "Click"
      - SCROLL: "Scroll"
      - HIGHLIGHT: "Highlight"
      - SWITCH: "Switch"

  But then we lose the context? 

  The problem says: "translate raw low-level actions into higher-level process steps or standardized activity names". So we are allowed to have higher-level activities.

  I think the best is to use:

      - Editing: for focus and typing in any document or email? But then what about applications like PDF? 
      - Viewing: for when the user is not editing? 
      - But we have SAVE which is "Saving".

  Given the complexity, I will use the following mapping (inspired by the ProM activity dictionary):

      - FOCUS -> "Editing"
      - TYPING -> "Editing"
      - SAVE -> "Saving"
      - CLICK -> "Clicking"
      - SCROLL -> "Scrolling"
      - HIGHLIGHT -> "Highlighting"
      - SWITCH -> "Switching"

  And then we can add context in the description? But the activity name is just the string.

  But then the activity names are not very meaningful? 

  Given the instructions and the time, I will use the following activity names:

      - FOCUS: "Editing Document"
      - TYPING: "Editing Document"
      - SAVE: "Saving Document"
      - CLICK: "Clicking"
      - SCROLL: "Scrolling"
      - HIGHLIGHT: "Highlighting"
      - SWITCH: "Switching Application"

  For email-specific actions, we can use:

      - CLICK with Action=Open Email: "Opening Email"
      - CLICK with Action=Reply to Email: "Replying to Email"
      - CLICK with Action=Send Email: "Sending Email"
      - For other CLICK events, "Clicking"

  And for email, the activity name will be one of the above? But then the activity name is not standardized if we have "Clicking" and "Opening Email" as different activities? 

  The problem says "standardized", so we should have the same activity name for the same type of activity? Then we cannot have "Opening Email" as an activity name because that is specific to an action? 

  Therefore, I will use:

      - "Interacting with email" for any click in the email list or on an email header? But we don't have that information.

  Given the above, I will use "Clicking" for all CLICK events and hope that the event log analysis can infer the context. But that is not very helpful for analysis.

  Alternatively, we can include the window title or application in the activity name? But the problem does not require it? And it would not be standardized.

  I think the best is to use the following compromise:

      - For CLICK events in the email application (Google Chrome) and when the Action is about email, use: "Email Interaction"
      - For other CLICK events, use "Clicking"

  But then "Email Interaction" is not very specific.

  Given the instructions and the time, I will proceed to assign activity names as follows:

      - FOCUS: "Editing"
      - TYPING: "Editing"
      - SAVE: "Saving"
      - CLICK: 
            - If the event has an "Action" and the Action starts with "Open", "Reply", or "Send", then use that action as the activity name.
            - Otherwise, "Clicking"
      - SCROLL: "Scrolling"
      - HIGHLIGHT: "Highlighting"
      - SWITCH: "Switching"

  And then in the explanation, we can describe the activity names.

  Now, let's build the event log.

  We will create a table with the following columns: 
      Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp

  We will number the cases arbitrarily. We have 5 unique (app, window) pairs.

  Case 1: (Microsoft Word, Quarterly_Report.docx)
  Case 2: (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx)
  Case 3: (Google Chrome, Email - Inbox)
  Case 4: (Adobe Acrobat, Report_Draft.pdf)
  Case 5: (Microsoft Excel, Budget_2024.xlsx)

  Event 1: 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z, FOCUS -> Case1, Activity: "Editing"
  Event 2: 2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z, FOCUS -> Case2, Activity: "Editing"
  Event 3: 2024-12-11T09:00:30.000Z, TYPING -> Case2, Activity: "Editing"
  Event 4: 2024-12-11T09:01:00.000Z, TYPING -> Case2, Activity: "Editing"
  Event 5: 2024-12-11T09:01:15.000Z, SAVE -> Case2, Activity: "Saving"
  Event 6: 2024-12-11T09:01:45.000Z, SWITCH -> Case3, Activity: "Switching"
  Event 7: 2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z, CLICK -> This event has Action="Open Email about Annual Meeting", so Activity: "Opening Email"
  Event 8: 2024-12-11T09:02:30.000Z, SCROLL -> Case3, Activity: "Scrolling"
  Event 9: 2024-12-11T09:02:45.000Z, CLICK -> Action="Reply to Email", so Activity: "Replying to Email"
  Event 10: 2024-12-11T09:03:00.000Z, TYPING -> Case3, Activity: "Editing" (because it's in the email)
  Event 11: 2024-12-11T09:03:20.000Z, CLICK -> Action="Send Email", so Activity: "Sending Email"
  Event 12: 2024-12-11T09:04:00.000Z, SWITCH -> Case4, Activity: "Switching"
  Event 13: 2024-12-11T09:04:30.000Z, SCROLL -> Case4, Activity: "Scrolling"
  Event 14: 2024-12-11T09:04:45.000Z, HIGHLIGHT -> Case4, Activity: "Highlighting"
  Event 15: 2024-12-11T09:05:00.000Z, FOCUS -> Case5, Activity: "Editing"
  Event 16: 2024-12-11T09:05:15.000Z, TYPING -> Case5, Activity: "Editing"
  Event 17: 2024-12-11T09:05:30.000Z, TYPING -> Case5, Activity: "Editing"
  Event 18: 2024-12-11T09:05:45.000Z, SAVE -> Case5, Activity: "Saving"
  Event 19: 2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z, SWITCH -> Case1, Activity: "Switching" (because the to app is Microsoft Word, window=Quarterly_Report.docx) -> "Switching to Microsoft Word"
  Event 20: 2024-12-11T09:06:15.000Z, TYPING -> Case1, Activity: "Editing"
  Event 21: 2024-12-11T09:06:30.000Z, SAVE -> Case1, Activity: "Saving"
  Event 22: 2024-12-11T09:07:00.000Z, FOCUS -> Case2, Activity: "Editing" (because the user focuses on Document1.docx again)
  Event 23: 2024-12-11T09:07:45.000Z, TYPING -> Case2, Activity: "Editing"
  Event 24: 2024-12-11T09:08:00.000Z, SAVE -> Case2, Activity: "Saving"
  Event 25: 2024-12-11T09:08:15.000Z, CLOSE -> Case2, Activity: "Closing Application" (we can add a activity for closing)

  Note: The CLOSE event is not included in the initial mapping. We can add "Closing" as an activity.

  But the problem says: "Each event in the final log should correspond to a meaningful activity". So for CLOSE, we can use "Closing".

  However, the initial mapping did not include CLOSE. So we need to extend the mapping.

  Let's add:

      - CLOSE: "Closing"

  So event25: Activity: "Closing"

  Also, note event22: the user focuses on Quarterly_Report.docx after working on Document1.docx? So that's case1, activity "Editing".

  Now, the event log in chronological order:

      Timestamp          Action        App            Window            Activity
      2024-12-11T08:59:50 FOCUS       Microsoft Word   Quarterly_Report.docx Editing

  event22: FOCUS in Document1.docx -> case2, activity: "Editing"
  event23: TYPING in Document1.docx -> case2, activity: "Editing"
  event24: SAVE in Document1.docx -> case2, activity: "Saving"
  event25: CLOSE in Document1.docx -> case2, activity: "Closing"

  This is 25 events.

  Now, the case for Document1.docx (case2) has events from 2024-12-11T09:00:00 to 2024-12-11T09:07:45? But the second session starts at 09:07:00? The events are in chronological order.

  Finally, we need to provide a Case ID for each case. We can use the case number as the Case ID? But the problem says Case ID should be a unique identifier. We can use integers.

  Also, the explanation and summary.

  Explanation and Summary:

  In this event log, we have created cases per unique (application, window) pair. This assumes that each time the user focuses on a particular document or window, it is part of the same case. This is because the window title and application represent the context for the activities. 

  The activity names are derived from the action type and, when available, the action description in the log. For example, for CLICK events in Google Chrome during email interactions, we used the specific action (e.g., "Opening Email") when available. For other CLICK events, we used "Clicking". 

  The events are sorted by timestamp. 

  This event log should be suitable for analysis with standard process mining tools like ProM. Analysts can group cases by the application and window to understand the flow. The activity names provide a higher-level view and can be used to filter and aggregate events.

  Coherent Narrative: 
      The user started by editing a document titled "Document1.docx". They saved their work and then switched to an email client to handle some emails. In the email, they opened a specific email, replied, typed some messages, and then sent it. After that, they switched to read a PDF and highlighted some text. Then, they opened an Excel file to work on some budget information, saved it, and then switched back to Word to work on the first document (Document1.docx) again, followed by the other document (Quarterly_Report.docx). Finally, they closed the second session of Document1.docx.

  This narrative shows the user's work in multiple applications and documents in a logical sequence.

  Let's format the event log as a table and then provide the explanation.

  Note: The Case ID is an integer (1-5) assigned to each unique (app, window) case.

  Final event log table:

  But note: the event for case1 at 09:06:00 is a switch to Microsoft Word, so the activity should be "Switching to Microsoft Word", not "Switching". Similarly, event12 is a switch from Excel to Google Chrome? But it's in case3? So the activity for event12 is "Switching" (without to details) because the log does not provide the from app? Actually, the event has FromApp and ToApp, but we only use the to app for the activity name? 

  We decided to use "Switching to [ToApp]".

  So event12: to app is Google Chrome? But the event has:

      2024-12-11T09:04:00.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Google Chrome,FromWindow=Email - Inbox,ToApp=Adobe Acrobat,ToWindow=Report_Draft.pdf

  So the to app is Adobe Acrobat? Then the activity name should be "Switching to Adobe Acrobat"? 

  But in our mapping, we used only the to app? Yes, activity name: "Switching to Adobe Acrobat"

  Similarly, event6: to app is Google Chrome, so "Switching to Google Chrome"

  event19: to app is Microsoft Word, so "Switching to Microsoft Word"

  So we must include the to app in the activity name for SWITCH.

  Therefore, we must extend the activity name for SWITCH to include the to app.

  Let's update the mapping:

      - SWITCH: "Switching to [ToApp]"

  Then event12: activity: "Switching to Adobe Acrobat"

  Also, event6: "Switching to Google Chrome"

  event19: "Switching to Microsoft Word"

  Now, the event log:

### Explanation & Logic

#### **Case Identification Logic**
- **Rationale**: Cases are grouped by logical work units based on:
  - **Application/Window Consistency**: Each unique combination of application and window represents a coherent work session (e.g., `Microsoft Word: Document1.docx` is one case, while `Microsoft Word: Quarterly_Report.docx` is a separate case).
  - **Activity Flow**: Events are grouped when they represent a single workflow goal. For example:
    - **Document1.docx**: Editing, saving, and switching away from the document (Case ID 1). The user returned to this document later, so its treated as one case with interleaved activities from other apps.
    - **Email Handling**: All email-related activities (opening, replying, sending) form one case (Case ID 2).
    - **PDF Editing**: Scrolling and highlighting in `Report_Draft.pdf` form one case (Case ID 3).
    - **Spreadsheet Work**: All activities in `Budget_2024.xlsx` form one case (Case ID 4).
    - **Quarterly_Report.docx**: Editing, saving, and closing form one case (Case ID 1, reused for continuity).

#### **Activity Naming**
- **Standardization Rules**:
  - Low-level actions (e.g., `TYPING`, `CLICK`) are mapped to higher-level activities:
    - `FOCUS`  "Editing [Document/PDF/Spreadsheet]"  
    - `TYPING`  "Editing [Document/PDF/Spreadsheet]"  
    - `SAVE`  "Saving [Document/PDF/Spreadsheet]"  
    - `CLICK`  "Clicking [Specific Action]" (e.g., "Replying to Email" if context is email)  
    - `SCROLL`  "Scrolling [App]"  
    - `HIGHLIGHT`  "Highlighting Text [App]"  
    - `SWITCH`  "Switching Application"  
    - `CLOSE`  "Closing Application"  
  - **Contextual Refinement**:  
    - Email-specific actions (e.g., `Open Email`, `Reply to Email`) retain descriptive names.  
    - Generic actions (e.g., `CLICK` in non-email contexts) are standardized to "Clicking".

#### **Coherent Narrative**
The log tells the story of a user editing multiple documents and emails in a single workday:
1. **Document1.docx**: The user edits and saves the document, then switches to email to handle messages.  
2. **Email**: The user opens a relevant email, replies, sends it, and switches to PDF editing.  
3. **PDF**: The user scrolls and highlights key text in the budget PDF.  
4. **Spreadsheet**: The user edits Excel data, saves it, and switches back to `Document1.docx` for further work.  
5. **Quarterly_Report.docx**: The user reopens and edits the final report, then closes it.  

This structure reveals tasks that are interrupted (e.g., email handling) and resumed, with cross-application workflows.
