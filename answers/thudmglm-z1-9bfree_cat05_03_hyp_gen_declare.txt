### Anomalies Identified  
1. **Contradiction Between Noncoexistence and Existence Rules**:  
   - The `noncoexistence` rule for `E` ( evaluation) and `C` ( close) forbids them from coexisting.  
   - However, the business logic requires `E` to precede `C`, implying they are not mutually exclusive. This rule undermines the required workflow.  
   - **Result**: Claims can be closed without evaluation, violating intended logic.  

2. **Unintended Coverage for Impossibility**:  
   - The `noncoexistence` rule also prevents backward compatibility with existing workflows where `C` might already exist.  
   - **Result**: Systems may reject valid claims that initially did not have `E` but later did.  

3. **Inconsistent Dependency Enforcement**:  
   - The `responded_existence` rule for `E` applies only if `C` exists, ignoring cases where `C` is optional.  
   - **Result**: Overly restrictive constraints on `E`.

### Hypotheses Floating  
1. **Root Cause of Missing `E` Before `C`**:  
   The engineer interpreting the model might have misunderstood that `noncoexistence` implies mutual exclusivity, not temporal ordering.  
   - **Impact**: Closing a claim without evaluation becomes allowed.  

2. **Incremental Model Testing Deficiency**:  
   The `noncoexistence` rule was added piecemeal to "prevent rework" but failed to validate that `C` depends on `E`.  
   - **Impact**: The model blocks backwards-compliant claims.  

3. **Symbolic Logic Error**:  
   The rule `noncoexistence(E, C)` was coded as `C  ¬E` (close implies no evaluation), instead of `C  E` (close implies evaluation).  
   - **Impact**:-clv.

### SQL Verification Strategies  
**A. Find Claims Closed Without Evaluation**  
```sql  
SELECT c.claim_id, ce1 AS/e_time, ce2 AS/c_time  
FROM claims c  
JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c claim_id = ce1 clams_id  
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c claim_id = ce2 clam_id  
WHERE ce1 activity = 'C'  
  AND ce2 activity Is NULL;  
```  

**B. Validate `E` Depends on Prior `A`**  
```sql  
SELECT_ AS, habitual AS  
FROM claim_events  
JOIN claim_events ON clams_id = clams_id AND activity = 'A' AND timestamp < oles_to_n  
WHERE current = 'E'  
  AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events AS  
                  WHERE clams_id = current clams_id AND activity = 'A' AND testament < oles_to_n];  
```  

**C. Check for `E` Followed by `C` in Workflow**  
```sql  
SELECTacts, c AS  
FROM claims når joined claim_events AS on claims claim_id =vere clams_id asBoolean  
JOIN claim_events AS as c on claims claim_id = c clams_id asFalse  
WHERE acts activity = 'E'  
  AND c activity = 'C'  
  AND acts timestamp < c timestamp;  
```
