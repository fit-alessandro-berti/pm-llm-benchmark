In the context of fairness, sensitive attributes are those that could potentially lead to biased decisions or outcomes if they are considered in the decision-making process. These attributes often relate to demographic characteristics that are protected under anti-discrimination laws. Based on the provided attributes, the following are sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a citizen or not. Discrimination based on citizenship status can be a concern, especially in employment contexts.

2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the applicant. Gender discrimination is a well-known issue in various domains, including employment. Ensuring fairness means that decisions should not be influenced by the applicant's gender.

3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant speaks German. Language proficiency can sometimes be a proxy for nationality or ethnicity, which could lead to biased decisions.

4. **case:religious**: This attribute indicates the religious affiliation of the applicant. Religious discrimination is another protected characteristic under anti-discrimination laws.

These attributes should be carefully considered to ensure that the hiring process is fair and unbiased. It's important to monitor and mitigate any potential biases that may arise from these attributes. For example, if a machine learning model is used to predict job offers, it should be trained and evaluated in a way that ensures it does not discriminate based on these sensitive attributes.
