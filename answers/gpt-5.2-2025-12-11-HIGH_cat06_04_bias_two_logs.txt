### Which log exhibits bias?
**Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias**—specifically, **preferential treatment** via an explicit **score boost** that is not available (or never applied) in Group A.

### How the bias manifests
#### 1) Systematic ScoreAdjustment advantage in Group B
- In **Group B**, when:
  - `LocalResident = TRUE` **and**
  - `CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club`
  
  the process applies a **`+10 (Community Boost)`** during **PreliminaryScoring**, and this boosted score is carried through **ManualReview** and into the **FinalDecision**.

- In **Group A**, `LocalResident` is always **FALSE**, `CommunityGroup` is always **None**, and **ScoreAdjustment is always 0 / N/A**—so applicants in Group A never receive an analogous benefit.

This is a structural difference in treatment: one group has access to an uplift mechanism tied to specific attributes; the other does not.

#### 2) The boost changes outcomes near the decision threshold
The clearest evidence is:

- **U003 (Group B)**  
  - PreliminaryScore = **695**
  - ScoreAdjustment = **+10**
  - Adjusted score = **705**
  - **FinalDecision = Approved**

Group A has no comparable “rescue” mechanism for borderline scores. If approval depends (even partly) on hitting a cutoff near ~705, then Group B applicants with the boost will be **systematically more likely to be approved**, even if their underlying (pre-boost) risk profile is similar.

Even where scores match, you can see the system is at least partly score-driven:
- **P002 (710)  Rejected** and **U002 (710)  Rejected** (no boost applied in U002)
- **P001 (720)  Approved** and **U001 (720730)  Approved**

So the **extra approvals in Group B can emerge specifically because of the boost**, not because of better baseline scores.

### Why this is bias (even if protected status isn’t directly used)
The bias is introduced through **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup** acting as **advantage-conferring attributes**. If the protected group (Group A) is less likely to be local residents or members of the favored community group (as your logs suggest), then the scoring rule creates **disparate impact**:

- **Group B gets a systematic uplift** tied to residency/community affiliation.
- **Group A does not**, resulting in fewer approvals for applicants with comparable underlying preliminary scores.

### Summary
- **Biased log/process:** **Group B**
- **Mechanism:** A **+10 “Community Boost”** tied to `LocalResident=TRUE` and membership in a specific `CommunityGroup`.
- **Effect:** Applicants in Group B can cross the approval boundary with a boost (e.g., 695  705  Approved), while Group A applicants lack access to the same pathway—creating systematic differences in final decisions.
