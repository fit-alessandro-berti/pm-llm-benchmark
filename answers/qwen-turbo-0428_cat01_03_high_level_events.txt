### **Proposed High-Level Activities**

```json
{
  "HighLevelActivities": [
    {
      "Name": "Material Preparation",
      "Description": "Preparation of raw materials for processing, including retrieval, identification, placement, alignment, and preheating.",
      "Rationale": "These events are temporally sequential, performed by the same resource (Operator A), and logically form the initial phase of preparing the raw material for subsequent processing steps. They ensure the material is correctly positioned and conditioned for assembly.",
      "LowLevelEvents": [
        "Retrieve raw metal sheet",
        "Scan barcode",
        "Place metal sheet on table",
        "Align metal sheet",
        "Preheat metal sheet"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Name": "Welding Assembly",
      "Description": "Execution of welding operations to join components, involving tool setup and specific welding tasks.",
      "Rationale": "This step involves sequential actions by Operator B (picking up the welding tool and performing spot welds). These activities are central to the assembly phase, directly contributing to the structural integrity of the product.",
      "LowLevelEvents": [
        "Pick up welding tool",
        "Weld corner A",
        "Weld corner B"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Name": "Quality Inspection",
      "Description": "Verification of product quality through automated and manual checks to ensure compliance with standards.",
      "Rationale": "This step includes both automated (sensor-based) and manual (visual) quality checks. The sensor check (post-welding) and visual inspection (post-coating) are critical for identifying defects and ensuring product reliability.",
      "LowLevelEvents": [
        "Measure weld integrity",
        "Visual check"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Name": "Protective Coating and Drying",
      "Description": "Application of a protective layer followed by drying to ensure durability and finish.",
      "Rationale": "These events are sequential and logically grouped as part of the finishing process. Applying the coating and drying it are interdependent steps that enhance the product's longevity and appearance.",
      "LowLevelEvents": [
        "Apply protective coating",
        "Dry coating"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

### **Key Rationale for Grouping**
1. **Material Preparation**:  
   - **Temporal Proximity**: Events occur within a short timeframe (08:00:05–08:00:20).  
   - **Resource Consistency**: Performed by Operator A.  
   - **Logical Flow**: Retrieval  Identification  Positioning  Preparation for assembly.  

2. **Welding Assembly**:  
   - **Resource Specificity**: Performed by Operator B, indicating a dedicated assembly phase.  
   - **Task Cohesion**: Tool pickup and welding are sequential and directly tied to structural assembly.  

3. **Quality Inspection**:  
   - **Purpose Alignment**: Both sensor-based and manual checks aim to validate product quality.  
   - **Timing**: Occurs after critical steps (welding and coating) to ensure defects are detected early.  

4. **Protective Coating and Drying**:  
   - **Process Dependency**: Coating application requires drying to achieve desired properties.  
   - **Resource Separation**: While performed by different units (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2), they form a unified finishing phase.

### **Summary**
This grouping organizes low-level events into coherent stages of the manufacturing workflow, emphasizing **material readiness**, **assembly**, **quality validation**, and **finishing**. Each high-level activity reflects a distinct phase of the process, enabling clearer analysis and process optimization.
