Sure! Below is the list of the "opposite" and "more general" concepts for each of the provided terms along with explanations:

---

1. **Automated Process Discovery**
   
   - **Opposite Concept**: **Manual Process Documentation**
     - *Explanation*: In contrast to automatically discovering process models from event logs, manual process documentation involves people actively gathering and detailing procedures based on interviews, observations, or knowledge from domain experts.
   
   - **More General Concept**: **Process Elicitation**
     - *Explanation*: Process elicitation is a more general concept that encompasses all approaches for understanding and documenting business processes, including both manual and automated methods.

---

2. **Predictive Monitoring**
   
   - **Opposite Concept**: **Post-mortem Analysis**
     - *Explanation*: While predictive monitoring aims to predict future behavior or anomalies in ongoing processes, post-mortem analysis occurs after process execution has ended and focuses on understanding the final outcomes and learning from past data.
   
   - **More General Concept**: **Process Analytics**
     - *Explanation*: Process analytics refers to the broad analysis of processes, leveraging both forward-looking (predictive) and backward-looking (descriptive or diagnostic) methods to enhance processes and decision-making.

---

3. **Bottom-up Discovery**
   
   - **Opposite Concept**: **Top-down Design**
     - *Explanation*: Bottom-up discovery builds process models from observed behaviors in event logs or system data, while top-down design involves starting from high-level business goals or predefined models and then refining them.
   
   - **More General Concept**: **Process Modeling**
     - *Explanation*: Process modeling is a general umbrella term that includes any method used to create representations of business processes, regardless of the specific approach (bottom-up, top-down, or otherwise).

---

4. **Process Simulation**
   
   - **Opposite Concept**: **Static Process Documentation**
     - *Explanation*: Process simulation involves creating dynamic, executable models that can test and predict how processes behave over time, whereas static process documentation captures a fixed representation of processes without any ability to dynamically simulate outcomes.
   
   - **More General Concept**: **Process Analysis**
     - *Explanation*: Process analysis encompasses a broad set of techniques used to understand, improve, and assess business processes, including both simulations and more static forms of analysis.

---

5. **Process Efficiency**
   
   - **Opposite Concept**: **Process Waste**
     - *Explanation*: Process efficiency focuses on maximizing resource usage and improving outcomes with minimal waste, while process waste looks at the inefficiencies or redundancies that prevent optimal performance in a process.
   
   - **More General Concept**: **Process Performance**
     - *Explanation*: Process performance is a broader concept that includes various aspects related to how well a process achieves its goals, including efficiency, effectiveness, compliance, timeliness, and quality.

---

6. **Real-time Monitoring**
   
   - **Opposite Concept**: **Batch Processing**
     - *Explanation*: Real-time monitoring involves continuously tracking and analyzing process data as it is generated, while batch processing handles data at specific intervals rather than continuously, leading to delayed insight.
   
   - **More General Concept**: **Process Monitoring**
     - *Explanation*: Process monitoring is a general term that covers both real-time and periodic (batch) tracking of processes to ensure they are performing as expected, irrespective of the timing of data collection or analysis.

These opposites and more general concepts provide a broader context within the field of process mining and business process management.
