Below is a single, integrated event log with enriched attributes, followed by concise reasoning about how events were matched and how conflicts were handled.

Field definitions
- primary_ts: chosen primary timestamp (System A where available; otherwise System B)
- ts_A: timestamp from System A (if present)
- ts_B: timestamp from System B (if present)
- ts_offset_sec: ts_B - ts_A in seconds when both exist (negative means B earlier)
- canonical_event: unified event name
- event_name_A / event_name_B: original names from each system
- origin: merged, A_only, or B_only
- match_confidence: high, medium, or n/a
- match_basis: brief reason for matching

How matching and conflicts were resolved
- Keys used: order_id + event semantics + timestamp proximity. System A was treated as the primary timeline; where both existed, primary_ts = ts_A; otherwise ts_B.
- Name mapping (A  B):
  - Order Received  OrderReceived
  - Order Validated  OrderValidation
  - Payment Processed  PaymentCheck
  - Item Shipped  Shipping
  - Item Delivered had no B counterpart; Quality Check existed only in B.
- Timestamp tolerance:
  - Base tolerance: 2 seconds  high confidence (events 1, 2, 5).
  - Extended tolerance: when names are clear synonyms and the sequence position is consistent, matched up to a few seconds beyond base (event 3 at 5 seconds). Rationale: System A can log “received” times while System B can reflect execution/completion, and Log B notes indicate a payment delay.
- Non-overlapping events:
  - Quality Check (B-only) included as its own event between payment and shipping based on ts_B.
  - Item Delivered (A-only) included as-is at the end; B did not record delivery.
- Attribute enrichment:
  - For merged events, user_id/resource_id/notes from B were added to A’s records.
  - Where an event existed in only one system, origin indicates A_only or B_only, and missing attributes are left blank.
