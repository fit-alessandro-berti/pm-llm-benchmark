Let's analyze each case in the event log against the normative process description step by step.

### Key Rules from Normative Description:
1. Always starts with "Receive order".
2. Next must be "Check inventory" before any decisions about payment or fulfillment.
3. If inventory sufficient:  
   - Proceed to "Authorize payment" (must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items").  
   - Then "Package items" (must occur after authorization and before shipping).  
   - Then "Ship order" (must occur after packaging).  
   - Finally "Close order".
4. If inventory insufficient:  
   - Proceed directly to "Cancel order" (after "Check inventory").  
   - Then "Close order".  
   - No fulfillment activities (authorize, package, ship) should occur after cancellation.
5. "Close order" must be the final activity in all cases.
6. Violations include:  
   - Shipping after cancellation.  
   - Authorizing payment before checking inventory.  
   - Packaging before authorization.  
   - Any deviation from the above sequences.

### Analysis of Each Case:

#### Case 1:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
This follows the sufficient inventory path exactly. No violations.

#### Case 2:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close  
Violation: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".  
Rule: "Authorize payment" should occur before "Package items" (since packaging should only occur after authorization).  
Also, the description states: "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging". Here, packaging is done before authorization, which is incorrect.

#### Case 3:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close  
Violations:  
1. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".  
   Rule: "Ship order should never occur after a cancellation".  
2. After "Check inventory", if inventory is insufficient, it should go directly to "Cancel order". But here, "Authorize payment" is done before cancellation.  
   Interpretation: The normative description implies that if inventory is insufficient, cancellation should occur immediately without authorization. Authorizing payment for an order that will be canceled is illogical.  
   So, both "Authorize payment" and "Ship order" should not occur in a cancellation scenario.

#### Case 4:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
This follows the insufficient inventory path exactly. No violations.

#### Case 5:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close  
Violation: Missing "Package items" between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".  
Rule: "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping". Shipping without packaging is not allowed. The description explicitly states the sequence for sufficient inventory: Authorize  Package  Ship. Skipping packaging is a violation.

### Summary of Violations:
- **Case 2**: Violates because "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".
- **Case 3**: Violates because it includes "Authorize payment" and "Ship order" after "Check inventory" in a cancellation scenario (and ships after cancellation).
- **Case 5**: Violates because it skips "Package items" between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".

Cases 1 and 4 are correct.

### Final Answer:
**Cases that violate the normative process:** Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5.

**Explanations:**
- **Case 2** violates the rule that "Authorize payment" must occur before "Package items". Here, packaging is done before authorization, which is not allowed.
- **Case 3** violates multiple rules: (1) After "Check inventory" reveals insufficient stock, the process should directly proceed to "Cancel order" without authorizing payment; (2) "Ship order" should never occur after cancellation. This case incorrectly includes authorization and shipping in a cancellation scenario.
- **Case 5** violates the rule that "Package items" must occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order". Here, packaging is skipped entirely, which deviates from the intended flow for sufficient inventory.

Cases 1 and 4 adhere perfectly to the normative process for sufficient and insufficient inventory scenarios, respectively.
