### 1) Redesign goals (what to change structurally)
- **Move “classification + decisioning” as early as possible** (standard vs. custom, approval thresholds, feasibility likelihood), using **rules (DMN)** + **predictive models**.
- **Maximize straight-through processing (STP)** for low-risk standard requests: automate checks, auto-approve when within policy, generate invoice/confirmation without human touch.
- Treat “custom” work as **case management** (adaptive subprocess) rather than a single linear path: custom requests rarely follow one fixed sequence.
- Replace “loop-back” rework with a **controlled re-quote / negotiation subprocess** (versioned quotes, timeboxes, clear exit criteria).
- Introduce **dynamic resource allocation** via skill-based queues, load balancing, and SLA-aware prioritization.

---

### 2) Changes by task/gateway (mapped to your pseudo-BPMN)

#### Start  **Task A: Receive Customer Request**
**Redesign**
- Split into an automated intake pipeline:
  - **A0: Capture + normalize request** (web form/API/EDI; enforce mandatory fields).
  - **A1: Data enrichment** (customer tier, contract terms, historical orders, credit status snapshot, product catalog constraints).
  - **A2: Pre-validation** (duplicate detection, incomplete data  auto-request missing info).
- Add an **event-based “Missing Info” interaction** so the process doesn’t block a human queue unnecessarily.

**Benefit:** fewer handoffs, fewer “stop-and-wait” delays, higher first-pass quality.

---

#### **Gateway: Check Request Type (XOR)**
**Redesign**
- Replace with a **hybrid decision layer**:
  - **Gateway G0 (XOR): “Predicted Handling Route”**
    - Route = *Standard STP*, *Standard Assisted*, *Custom Likely*, *Custom Complex/High Risk*
  - Use:
    - **Rules (DMN):** explicit product/contract rules (e.g., “SKU X always custom”).
    - **Predictive model:** probability request needs customization + expected effort + risk of rejection.

**Benefit:** proactive routing and earlier “right team” assignment; avoids late discovery of customization needs.

---

### Standard path improvements

#### **Task B1: Perform Standard Validation**
**Redesign**
- Automate with rules + service calls:
  - Validate configuration, pricing eligibility, shipping constraints.
  - If validation fails, route to an **Exception subprocess** rather than dropping into custom by default.

**New Gateway**
- **G1 (XOR): “Validation Outcome”**  Pass / Fixable Exception / Hard Fail

**Benefit:** prevents “false custom” cases and reduces cycle time for fixable issues.

---

#### **Gateway (AND): Run Parallel Checks  Tasks C1/C2**
**Redesign**
- Keep parallelism, but make it **asynchronous and cancellable**:
  - **C1 Credit Check** via API + cached credit score; if score already fresh, skip.
  - **C2 Inventory Check** becomes “ATP/CTP check” (available-to-promise / capable-to-promise), possibly with reservation hold.
- Add **early exit logic**:
  - If credit fails hard, cancel inventory reservation automatically.
  - If inventory unavailable, trigger alternate sourcing/lead-time estimation.

**New Gateway**
- **G2 (Event-based): “Check results arrive / timeout”**
  - Add **timer boundary events** to avoid long waits; route to manual follow-up if systems are slow.

**Benefit:** reduces waiting, avoids wasted work, improves responsiveness when dependencies lag.

---

#### **Task D: Calculate Delivery Date**
**Redesign**
- Use predictive ETA:
  - Combine ATP/CTP, carrier performance, warehouse load, seasonality.
- Output becomes not just a date but a **confidence interval** and recommended options (standard vs expedited).

**Benefit:** better promises  higher customer trust; fewer later exceptions.

---

### Custom path improvements

#### **Task B2: Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis**
**Redesign**
- Convert into an **adaptive “Custom Case” subprocess** with automation-first triage:
  - **B2a Auto-feasibility pre-check** (rules: engineering constraints, approved patterns).
  - **B2b Predict effort & margin** (model estimates engineering hours, risk, cost uplift).
  - **B2c Skill-based assignment** to the right expert pool (engineering / pricing / legal).

**Benefit:** faster “yes/no” and better prioritization of scarce expert resources.

---

#### **Gateway: Is Customization Feasible?**
**Redesign**
- Make feasibility multi-dimensional:
  - **G3 (XOR): “Feasible?”**
    - Yes (within known pattern)  fast-track quote
    - Yes (novel/uncertain)  engineering review queue
    - No  rejection with alternatives
- Add **customer alternative offers** (e.g., near-standard variants) before rejection.

**Benefit:** fewer outright rejections; improved satisfaction via options.

---

#### **Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation**
**Redesign**
- Automate quote generation:
  - CPQ rules, approved templates, dynamic margin guardrails.
  - Pre-fill from predicted effort/cost.
- Add **quote versioning** and an explicit negotiation step rather than looping back ambiguously.

**New Subprocess**
- **“Negotiate & Re-quote (bounded)”**: max N iterations or timebox; after that escalate or close.

**Benefit:** reduces uncontrolled loops and cycle-time explosion.

---

#### **Task E2: Send Rejection Notice**
**Redesign**
- Make it “rejection with recommendations”:
  - Provide closest standard alternative + lead time + price band.
  - Option to convert to standard request automatically.

**Benefit:** preserves revenue opportunities and improves experience.

---

### Convergence + approval improvements

#### **Gateway: Is Approval Needed?**
**Redesign**
- Replace with **risk-based dynamic approval**:
  - **G4 (XOR): “Approval Policy Outcome”**
    - Auto-approve (low value/low risk within policy)
    - Manager approve
    - Finance/Legal approve (for special terms)
- Use DMN thresholds (deal size, discount, customer risk, novelty, margin).

**Benefit:** removes unnecessary approvals; focuses humans where they add value.

---

#### **Task F: Obtain Manager Approval** + **Gateway: Is Approval Granted?**
**Redesign**
- Introduce:
  - **Parallel pre-approval packaging**: compile rationale, risk signals, and recommended decision.
  - **SLA timers** + auto-escalation to backup approvers.
- Consider “approve with conditions” as a third outcome.

**New Gateway**
- **G5 (XOR): Approval decision**
  - Approved
  - Approved w/ conditions  auto-adjust quote/invoice
  - Rejected  enter bounded negotiation/rework subprocess

**Benefit:** fewer stalls and fewer vague rework cycles.

---

#### **Task H: Re-evaluate Conditions (loop back)**
**Redesign**
- Replace loop-back to D/E1 with a single controlled subprocess:
  - **“Rework & Re-quote”** (captures reason codes, adjusts only allowed parameters, re-runs impacted checks only).
  - Uses **impact analysis**: if only price changed, don’t re-run inventory; if delivery changed, re-run ETA only.

**Benefit:** minimizes redundant work and makes rework measurable.

---

#### **Task G: Generate Final Invoice**
**Redesign**
- Automate invoice creation + compliance checks:
  - Tax rules, contract terms, payment terms verification.
- If invoice depends on uncertain elements (custom lead times), allow **proforma invoice** then convert.

**Benefit:** faster close; fewer billing errors.

---

#### **Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer**
**Redesign**
- Upgrade to proactive comms:
  - Confirmation includes ETA confidence, milestones, self-service tracking, and change-request link.
- Add optional **customer acceptance** event for custom quotes (don’t proceed until accepted).

**Benefit:** fewer disputes and fewer downstream cancellations.

---

### 3) New elements to add (to improve flexibility and speed)

1) **Predictive Triage Gateway (early)**
- Inputs: request attributes, customer history, SKU complexity, past exception rates
- Outputs: route + priority + recommended assignee pool

2) **Skill-based work queues + dynamic reallocation**
- Auto-assign based on:
  - skills (custom engineering vs pricing vs legal),
  - current load,
  - SLA/priority (VIP customers, expiring quotes),
  - predicted effort (short jobs first where appropriate)

3) **Exception subprocesses**
- “Credit Exception”
- “Inventory Shortage / Alternate Sourcing”
- “Incomplete Data / Customer Clarification”
These prevent the whole process from becoming “custom” due to one issue.

4) **Process intelligence loop**
- Monitor cycle time by segment; feed outcomes back to:
  - improve the predictive model,
  - refine DMN decision tables,
  - identify automation candidates via process mining.

---

### 4) Impact assessment (what changes operationally)

**Turnaround time**
- Likely decreases significantly for standard requests due to STP + auto-approval.
- Custom requests improve via better triage and reduced rework loops, though complex ones may still take time (but with fewer idle waits).

**Customer satisfaction**
- Faster initial responses (“we’ve classified your request; here’s ETA/next step”).
- Better promise accuracy via predictive delivery.
- Fewer dead-end rejections (alternatives offered).
- More transparency (milestones, acceptance steps, proactive updates).

**Operational complexity**
- Increases in *system* complexity (models, rules, integrations, orchestration).
- Decreases in *human coordination* complexity (clearer routing, fewer loops, less manual chasing).
- Requires governance:
  - model monitoring (bias/drift),
  - rule ownership (DMN lifecycle),
  - auditability (why was it auto-approved / routed).

---

### 5) One possible revised high-level flow (compact pseudo-BPMN)
- Start  
   **A0/A1/A2 Automated intake & enrichment**  
   **G0 Predictive + rules-based routing**  
   (Standard STP) **Parallel C1/C2** (async + timers)  **D Predictive ETA**  **G4 Risk-based approval**  **G Invoice**  
   (Custom Case) **B2 Custom case subprocess (triage  feasibility  quote)**  **G4 Risk-based approval**  **G Invoice**  
   **I Confirmation + tracking / acceptance event (if needed)**  
   End

If you want, I can produce (a) a more formal BPMN 2.0-style textual model with explicit boundary events/timers/messages, or (b) a table that lists each original step with “automation candidates, required data, and KPIs impacted.”
