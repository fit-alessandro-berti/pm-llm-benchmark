### Explanation of Grouping and Naming Logic

**Grouping into Cases:**  
We grouped events based on the logical progression of tasks within a single user session. Each case represents a distinct workflow, such as reviewing documents, editing content, handling emails, or preparing reports. This grouping is intuitive because it reflects how users transition between activities, moving from document creation and editing to email management and report preparation, with each stage naturally leading into the next.

**Activity Naming:**  
Activities are named based on their purpose within the process. For instance, "Editing Document" encompasses both opening a file and making changes, while "Opening Email" or "Typing in Reply" clearly describes actions specific to email handling. These names are chosen to be descriptive and align with common process mining terminology, facilitating easier analysis and understanding of the workflow.

### Summary

The provided system log was transformed into a coherent event log suitable for process mining analysis. Each case corresponds to a logical workflow, such as editing documents or managing emails, reflecting the user's interactions with various applications. The activity names are descriptive and aim to standardize processes across different instances, allowing for consistent and meaningful analysis. This transformation enables analysts to study workflows, identify bottlenecks, and optimize processes effectively.
