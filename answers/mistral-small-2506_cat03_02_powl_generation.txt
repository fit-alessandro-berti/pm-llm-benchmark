Here's the Python code to construct the POWL model for the described digital service provisioning process:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Initial Service Request Verification
sr = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")

# Step 2: Contract Setup (must be done after SR)
cs = Transition(label="Contract Setup")

# Step 3: Parallel Datacenter Allocation and Access Control Initialization
da = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
aci = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")

# Step 4: Looped Configuration Phase
bnc = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
dr = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")

# Create the loop structure (BNC followed by optional D&R)
config_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[bnc, dr])

# Step 5: Exclusive choice for deployment
cd = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
md = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cd, md])

# Step 6: Final tasks in partial order
qa = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
sa = Transition(label="Security Audit")

# Step 7: Final Go-Live Approval
gla = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Construct the overall process model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    sr,
    cs,
    da,
    aci,
    config_loop,
    deployment_choice,
    qa,
    sa,
    gla
])

# Define the partial order relationships
# SR must be done first
root.order.add_edge(sr, cs)

# CS must be done before parallel tasks
root.order.add_edge(cs, da)
root.order.add_edge(cs, aci)

# Both DA and ACI must complete before configuration loop
root.order.add_edge(da, config_loop)
root.order.add_edge(aci, config_loop)

# Configuration loop must complete before deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(config_loop, deployment_choice)

# Deployment choice must complete before QA and SA
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, qa)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, sa)

# Both QA and SA must complete before GLA
root.order.add_edge(qa, gla)
root.order.add_edge(sa, gla)

# Note: DA and ACI are concurrent (no order between them)
# QA and SA are concurrent (no order between them)
```

This code constructs the POWL model with all the required components:

1. The initial service request verification (SR) is the starting point.
2. Contract setup (CS) must follow SR.
3. Datacenter Allocation (DA) and Access Control Initialization (ACI) can run in parallel after CS.
4. The configuration loop (BNC followed by optional D&R) starts only after both DA and ACI complete.
5. After the configuration loop, there's an exclusive choice between Containerized Deployment (CD) and Monolithic Deployment (MD).
6. After deployment, Quality Assurance (QA) and Security Audit (SA) can run in any order or concurrently.
7. Finally, Go-Live Approval (GLA) occurs after both QA and SA complete.

The model uses:
- `Transition` nodes for all labeled activities
- `OperatorPOWL` nodes for the loop (BNC followed by optional D&R) and the exclusive choice (CD or MD)
- `StrictPartialOrder` as the root node with all the ordering constraints defined through `add_edge` calls
- No silent transitions are needed in this scenario
