To address the task, we need to systematically examine each case in the event log and evaluate if the sequence of activities deviates from the outlined normative process description. Let's analyze each case:

### Case 1
- Activities: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order.
- **Analysis**: This sequence adheres strictly to the described normative process for situations where inventory is sufficient. There are no violations observed.

### Case 2
- Activities: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order.
- **Violations**:
  1. **Package items** occurred before **Authorize payment**. The normative description specifies that authorization of payment should occur after checking inventory and before any packaging, ensuring payment methods are valid and approved prior to preparing the shipment.
  2. **Package items** without prior payment authorization goes against the sequence of ensuring financial transactions are confirmed before committing to logistical operations.
  
### Case 3
- Activities: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order.
- **Violations**:
  1. **Authorize payment** followed by **Cancel order**. While the description does allow for cancellation if inventory is insufficient, authorizing payment before confirming the cancellation status creates a conflict. This indicates that payment was authorized despite a determination that the order could not be fulfilled.
  2. **Ship order** proceeding after **Cancel order**. According to the normative process, shipment should not occur if an order has been canceled. This activity should be avoided entirely in cancellation scenarios.

### Case 4
- Activities: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order.
- **Analysis**: This is the correct sequence when inventory is insufficient to fulfill the order. The process goes directly from checking inventory to cancellation and then to close the order, as specified for insufficient inventory scenarios. There are no violations.

### Case 5
- Activities: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order.
- **Violations**:
  1. **Ship order** without **Package items**. The process description requires that items be packaged before they are shipped. Omitting the packaging step disrupts the logical preparation sequence intended to ensure that items are ready and properly organized for shipment.

### Summary of Violations:
- **Case 2**: Errors in the sequence of payment authorization and packaging.
- **Case 3**: Unauthorized activities post-cancellation and premature payment authorization.
- **Case 5**: Omitted packaging step before shipment.

Each identified deviation from the normative description disrupts either the financial integrity, shipment accuracy, or both, of the order handling process.
