Based on the given details, several potential root causes of performance issues in the process can be identified:

### Performance Issues:
- **Submission Rate:**
  - The process is submitted faster than it gets processed by key stakeholders.
  
  **Specific Patterns:**
    - Employee submits multiple declarations quickly (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> DECLARED APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER). 
    - This could lead to a backlog as the declaration might still sit pending before reaching either administration or budget owner.

### Causes/Contributors:
1. **Inefficient Workflow Processes:**
   - The process may have inefficient workflows that cause significant bottlenecks when key stakeholders such as PRE_APPROVER and BUDGET OWNER reject multiple consecutive declarations from an employee.
   
2. **Insufficient Oversight:**
   - The system may lack sufficient supervision to handle the workflow flow, leading to missed deadlines or approvals.

3. **High Frequency of Rejections:**
   - The declarations are frequently rejected by key roles (PRE_APPROVER and BUDGET OWNER), causing delays in submission for other employees.
   
### Possible Mitigations:

1. **Optimize Workflow Approvals:**
   - Implement a strategy where PRE_APPROVER or ADMINISTRATION takes immediate action on duplicate or critical rejections instead of merely rejecting the declaration.

2. **Monitor Submission Patterns and Rejection Flows:**
   - Analyze patterns to identify frequent users, slow submission time, or delays in approval that could lead to multiple consecutive rejections from an employee.

3. **Real-Time Feedback Mechanism:**
    - Introduce a system where immediate feedback is provided by PRE_APPROVER/ADMINISTRATION on duplicate rejection requests allowing quicker resolution of the issues without further reprocessing of subsequent submissions.

4. **Automated Email Reminders and Notifications:**
   - Implement reminder systems to alert concerned staff promptly when declarations fail multiple approval stages, minimizing lost time from pending work that can cause delays downstream.

5. **Enhance Document Review Mechanisms:**
   - Streamline the submission process document review workflow for efficient handling of rejections and additional approvals.

### Example Scenario:
- If a declaration is repeated in rapid-fire fashion (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> DECLARED REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, then DECLARED APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION), introducing an automated message through email to PRE_APPROVER or ADMINS indicating the number of pending/rejected declarations might help address it more effectively by providing preemptive actions.

By addressing these components within the system architecture and optimizing processes, one can improve overall performance in key areas.
