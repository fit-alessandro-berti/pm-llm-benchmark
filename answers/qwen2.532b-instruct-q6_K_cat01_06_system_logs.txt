To transform the provided Windows system log into a process mining event log, we need to identify meaningful activities and group them into coherent cases based on logical user work sessions. The following table represents the transformed event log:

| Case ID | Activity Name               | Timestamp                  |
|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|

### Explanation of Logic

**Case Identification:**
- **C1**: This case involves activities related to editing and saving "Document1.docx". The user opens, edits, saves, closes, and then reopens the document.
- **E1**: This case represents handling an email. The sequence includes opening the inbox, scrolling through emails, replying to a specific one, editing the reply, and sending it.
- **R1**: This case involves viewing a PDF report "Report_Draft.pdf". The user opens the file, scrolls down, and highlights some text in it.
- **B1**: This case pertains to working with an Excel budget document. The user opens the file, makes edits, and saves changes.
- **Q1**: This case is about editing a quarterly report "Quarterly_Report.docx". It includes opening the document, making edits, saving changes, and finally closing it.

**Activity Naming:**
- **Open Document/Report/Budget File**: Any `FOCUS` action with an application that implies opening a file.
- **Edit Document/Email/Report/Budget**: Any `TYPING`, `CLICK`, or other editing actions within the respective application (Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Excel).
- **Save Document/Report/Budget**: Any `SAVE` action within the document/file being edited.
- **Close Document/Report**: Any `CLOSE` action at the end of working with a file.

This transformation and case identification allows us to capture coherent user work sessions in each application, making it suitable for process mining analysis. Each event is clearly categorized into meaningful cases and activities that reflect the logical sequence of tasks performed by the user during their session.
