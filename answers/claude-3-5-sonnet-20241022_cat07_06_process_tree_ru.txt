This visualization appears to be a process flow diagram or decision tree showing different steps and potential paths in what seems to be a request handling system. The diagram starts with "register request" and branches into multiple paths using "seq" (sequence) and "xor" (exclusive or) operators.

The main branches include:
1. A path through "xor loop" to "reinitiate request"
2. A path through "xor" that splits to either "reject request" or "pay compensation"
3. A sequence that leads to an "and" operation combining "check ticket" and "decide"
4. The final branch shows an "xor" choice between "examine thoroughly" and "examine casually"

The diagram uses oval shapes for all elements and connects them with lines to show the flow and relationships between different actions and decisions in the process. The structure suggests this could be representing a business process or service request handling workflow.
