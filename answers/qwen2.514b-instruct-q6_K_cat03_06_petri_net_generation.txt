To construct an accepting Petri net for the given insurance claim management process, we'll create a sequence of transitions representing each activity in the claim management process. We will also add loops for scenarios where re-submission of documents or in-depth investigations are required. This involves creating places to represent states between activities and adding arcs to connect these places through transitions.

The Python code below defines the Petri net according to the described scenario:

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Define the Petri Net and its components
net = PetriNet("insurance_claim_process")

# Adding places for each state in the claim process
source = PetriNet.Place(name="C")
claim_registration = PetriNet.Place(name="CR")
document_verification = PetriNet.Place(name="DV")
fraud_check = PetriNet.Place(name="FC")
re_document_submission = PetriNet.Place(name="RDS")
in_depth_investigation = PetriNet.Place(name="II")
claim_assessment = PetriNet.Place(name="CA")
approval = PetriNet.Place(name="AP")
payment = PetriNet.Place(name="P")
notification = PetriNet.Place(name="N")
closure = PetriNet.Place(name="CL")

# Adding transitions for each activity
transitions = [
    PetriNet.Transition("execute_CR", "Claim Registration"),
    PetriNet.Transition("execute_DV", "Document Verification"),
    PetriNet.Transition("execute_FC", "Fraud Check"),
    PetriNet.Transition("execute_RDS", "Re-Document Submission"),
    PetriNet.Transition("execute_II", "In-depth Investigation"),
    PetriNet.Transition("execute_CA", "Claim Assessment"),
    PetriNet.Transition("execute_AP", "Approval"),
    PetriNet.Transition("execute_P", "Payment"),
    PetriNet.Transition("execute_N", "Notification"),
    PetriNet.Transition("execute_CL", "Closure")
]

# Adding transitions to the net
for t in transitions:
    net.transitions.add(t)

# Adding arcs between places and transitions
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source, transitions[0], net)  # C -> Claim Registration (CR)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[0], claim_registration, net)  # CR -> CR

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_registration, transitions[1], net)  # CR -> Document Verification (DV)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[1], document_verification, net)  # DV -> DV

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(document_verification, transitions[2], net)  # DV -> Fraud Check (FC)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[2], fraud_check, net)  # FC -> FC
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_check, transitions[4], net)  # FC -> In-depth Investigation (II)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(in_depth_investigation, transitions[1], net)  # II -> Document Verification (DV)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(document_verification, transitions[3], net)  # DV -> Re-Document Submission (RDS)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(re_document_submission, transitions[2], net)  # RDS -> Fraud Check (FC)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_check, transitions[5], net)  # FC -> Claim Assessment (CA)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(in_depth_investigation, transitions[5], net)  # II -> Claim Assessment (CA)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[5], claim_assessment, net)  # CA -> CA

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_assessment, transitions[6], net)  # CA -> Approval (AP)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[6], approval, net)  # AP -> AP

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(approval, transitions[7], net)  # AP -> Payment (P)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[7], payment, net)  # P -> P

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment, transitions[8], net)  # P -> Notification (N)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[8], notification, net)  # N -> N

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notification, transitions[9], net)  # N -> Closure (CL)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[9], closure, net)  # CL -> CL

# Adding places to the Petri Net
net.places.update([source,
                   claim_registration,
                   document_verification,
                   fraud_check,
                   re_document_submission,
                   in_depth_investigation,
                   claim_assessment,
                   approval,
                   payment,
                   notification,
                   closure])

# Defining initial and final markings
im = Marking()
fm = Marking()

# Initial marking: start with one token at the source place (C)
im[source] = 1

# Final marking: end with one token at the Closure (CL) place
fm[closure] = 1

print("Petri Net constructed successfully.")
```

### Explanation:
- **Places** are added for each state in the process (e.g., "CR" for Claim Registration, etc.).
- **Transitions** represent activities that move tokens from one state to another.
- **Arcs** connect places and transitions according to the sequence of operations and loops needed due to possible re-submission or investigations.

### Final Marking:
- The initial marking (`im`) starts with a token at "C" (the source place) representing an incoming claim.
- The final marking (`fm`) ends with a token at "CL" (Closure), indicating that the process has concluded successfully.

The Petri Net and its markings can be further analyzed or visualized using PM4Py tools for simulation or process mining tasks.
