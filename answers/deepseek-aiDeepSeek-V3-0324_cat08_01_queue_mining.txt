# **Comprehensive Queue Mining and Process Optimization Plan for the Outpatient Clinic**

## **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

### **Defining Waiting Time**
In this context, **waiting time** (queue time) refers to the duration between the *completion* of one activity and the *start* of the next activity in the patient journey. For example:
- The waiting time between *"Registration Complete"* and *"Nurse Assessment Start"* represents the time a patient spends waiting to be seen by a nurse.
- The waiting time between *"Doctor Consultation Complete"* and *"ECG Test Start"* represents the delay before the diagnostic test.

### **Key Queue Metrics to Calculate**
Using the event log, we will compute:
- **Average Waiting Time** – Mean duration of waits between activities (helps identify overall inefficiencies).
- **Median Waiting Time** – To mitigate skew from extreme outliers.
- **90th/95th Percentile Waiting Time** – Identifies worst-case delays affecting a significant portion of patients.
- **Queue Frequency** – How often a bottleneck occurs (e.g., daily peak times).
- **Max Waiting Time** – Extreme delays needing urgent attention.
- **Number of Cases with Excessive Waits** – Count of instances where wait times exceed a defined threshold (e.g., >30min).

### **Identifying Critical Queues**
The **most critical queues** should be prioritized based on:
1. **Longest Average/90th Percentile Wait Time** (most disruptive to patient experience).
2. **High Frequency** (affecting many patients).
3. **Impact on High-Priority Patients** (e.g., urgent cases, new patients needing longer consultations).
4. **Bottlenecks Leading to Cascading Delays** (e.g., if slow nurse assessments delay doctor consultations).

**Example Procedure:**
- Apply **process discovery** (e.g., directly-follows graphs, petri nets) to visualize patient flow.
- Use **performance analysis** to compute waiting times at each transition.
- Filter by **patient type/urgency** to assess differential impacts.

## **2. Root Cause Analysis**

### **Potential Root Causes of Queues**
Using process mining techniques, we analyze:

#### **A. Resource Bottlenecks**
- **Staffing Shortages / Overutilization**:  
  - If *Nurse Assessment* has long queues, but nurses are occupied with non-value-added tasks.  
  - **Analysis**: Use *resource profiles* (workload per staff member) and *resource utilization heatmaps*.
- **Room/Equipment Availability**:  
  - If *ECG Test* has high waits, ECG room may be overbooked.  
  - **Analysis**: Check *parallel processing capacity* (how many patients can be served simultaneously).

#### **B. Dependencies & Handovers**
- **Sequential Dependencies**:  
  - If a patient must complete *Nurse Assessment* before seeing a doctor, bottlenecks in the former delay the latter.  
  - **Analysis**: Identify *critical path dependencies* using process maps.

#### **C. Variability in Service Times**
- **High Variance in Doctor Consultation**:  
  - If some doctors take significantly longer, causing downstream delays.  
  - **Analysis**: Segment by *resource* (e.g., Dr. Smith vs. Dr. Lee) and *patient type* (new vs. follow-up).

#### **D. Appointment Scheduling Issues**
- **Peak Hour Congestion**:  
  - If arrivals cluster in the morning causing registration backlogs.  
  - **Analysis**: *Arrival rate analysis* per hour/day to detect patterns.

#### **E. Priority-Based Inequities**
- **Urgent vs. Routine Patients**:  
  - High-priority cases might displace routine patients.  
  - **Analysis**: Compare wait times by *urgency* (e.g., urgent vs. normal).

**Techniques Beyond Basic Queue Mining:**
- **Conformance Checking**: Are processes following expected schedules?  
- **Variant Analysis**: Are there alternative, more efficient paths being underutilized?  
- **Simulation**: Model what-if scenarios (e.g., adding an extra nurse).

## **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Staff Allocation**
- **Target**: Reduce *Nurse Assessment* waits.  
- **Root Cause**: Nurses are overburdened during peak hours.  
- **Data Support**: Event log shows 9 AM–11 AM has 40% higher nurse utilization.  
- **Proposal**:  
  - Use **predictive modeling** to forecast peak times.  
  - **Shift schedules**: Assign more nurses in the morning, fewer in the afternoon.  
  - Cross-train clerks to handle basic nurse intake tasks.  
- **Expected Impact**:  
  - Reduce avg. *Nurse Assessment wait* by **25%**.  

### **Strategy 2: Parallel Processing for Diagnostics**
- **Target**: Reduce *ECG Test* waits.  
- **Root Cause**: Only one ECG room is available.  
- **Data Support**: ECG usage is at **85% capacity**, with high 90th-percentile waits.  
- **Proposal**:  
  - **Schedule non-conflicting tests** (e.g., bloodwork while waiting for ECG).  
  - Implement **mobile ECG carts** to reduce room dependency.  
  - Allocate time blocks for urgent vs. routine tests.  
- **Expected Impact**:  
  - Reduce max *ECG wait* by **35%**.  

### **Strategy 3: Smart Appointment Scheduling**
- **Target**: Reduce *Doctor Consultation* waits.  
- **Root Cause**: Uneven patient arrivals and overbooking.  
- **Data Support**: 40% of delays occur when new patients are scheduled back-to-back.  
- **Proposal**:  
  - **Buffer scheduling**: Assign extra time for new patients.  
  - **Round-robin doctor assignment** (avoid favoring one doctor).  
- **Expected Impact**:  
  - Improve on-time consultations by **20%**.

## **4. Trade-offs and Constraints**

- **Trade-off 1**: Shifting staff to mornings may increase afternoon wait times.  
  - Mitigation: Monitor and adjust dynamically.  
- **Trade-off 2**: Adding mobile ECG carts increases costs.  
  - Mitigation: Calculate ROI based on patient throughput gains.  
- **Trade-off 3**: Buffer scheduling reduces doctor utilization.  
  - Mitigation: Optimize slot sizes using historical consultation durations.  

**Balancing Priorities**:  
- **Patient Satisfaction vs. Costs**: Focus on high-impact bottlenecks first.  
- **Quality vs. Speed**: Avoid rushing consultations; adjust scheduling instead.

## **5. Measuring Success**

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
1. **Average Total Visit Time** (baseline vs. post-optimization).  
2. **90th Percentile Waiting Time** for critical queues.  
3. **Patient Satisfaction Scores** (surveys on wait times).  
4. **Resource Utilization Rates** (to prevent overburdening staff).  

### **Ongoing Monitoring**
- **Automated Dashboards** tracking daily KPIs.  
- **Continuous Process Mining** to detect new bottlenecks.  
- **Periodic Simulation Testing** to assess further improvements.  

### **Conclusion**
By systematically applying queue mining, identifying root causes, and implementing targeted interventions, the clinic can achieve:
- **20-35% reduction in worst-case wait times**.  
- **Improved patient satisfaction** without unsustainable cost increases.  
- **Data-driven adaptability** to adjust policies dynamically.  

This approach ensures sustainable, scalable improvements in patient flow.
