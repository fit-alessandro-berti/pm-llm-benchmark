To group the events into distinct cases, we need to analyze the sequence of activities, the timestamps, and the attributes such as `patient_age` and `patient_gender`. Here's a step-by-step approach to identify the different cases:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Initial Registration Events:**
   - These events mark the start of a new case.
   
2. **Track Activities and Timestamps:**
   - Follow each patient's journey through the hospital using subsequent activities and timestamps.

3. **Use Logical Flow:**
   - Certain activities (like discharge) indicate the end of a case.

### Grouping Events into Cases

#### Case 1:
- **Initial Registration:**
  - Event 1: `Register patient` (Age: 45, Gender: M)
- **Activities:**
  - Event 4: `Initial triage` (Age: 45, Gender: M)
  - Event 12: `Doctor consultation` (Diagnosis: hairline fracture, Age: 45, Gender: M)
  - Event 13: `Prescription created` (Medication: antibiotics, Age: 45, Gender: M)
  - Event 30: `Patient discharged` (Follow-up: outpatient clinic, Age: 45, Gender: M)

#### Case 2:
- **Initial Registration:**
  - Event 2: `Register patient` (Age: 62, Gender: F)
- **Activities:**
  - Event 5: `Initial triage` (Age: 62, Gender: F)
  - Event 8: `Lab test requested` (Test type: blood panel, Age: 62, Gender: F)
  - Event 10: `Lab test completed` (Results: normal levels, Age: 62, Gender: F)
  - Event 16: `Doctor consultation` (Diagnosis: minor infection, Age: 62, Gender: F)
  - Event 27: `Prescription created` (Medication: antibiotics, Age: 62, Gender: F)
  - Event 35: `Patient discharged` (Follow-up: pharmacy pickup, Age: 62, Gender: F)

#### Case 3:
- **Initial Registration:**
  - Event 3: `Register patient` (Age: 28, Gender: M)
- **Activities:**
  - Event 6: `Doctor consultation` (Reason: scheduled knee surgery, Age: 28, Gender: M)
  - Event 9: `Surgery preparation` (Prep type: general anesthesia, Age: 28, Gender: M)
  - Event 13: `Surgery performed` (Procedure: arthroscopy, Age: 28, Gender: M)
  - Event 15: `Recovery room` (Condition: stable, Age: 28, Gender: M)
  - Event 18: `Patient discharged` (Follow-up: physiotherapy sessions, Age: 28, Gender: M)

### Summary of Cases

1. **Case 1 (Patient Age: 45, Gender: Male)**
   - Events: 1, 4, 12, 13, 30

2. **Case 2 (Patient Age: 62, Gender: Female)**
   - Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 16, 27, 35

3. **Case 3 (Patient Age: 28, Gender: Male)**
   - Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 15, 18

By following this method, we ensure that each event is logically grouped into the correct case based on the sequence of activities and the attributes provided.
