# Analysis of Anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Event Log

After analyzing the provided event log, I've identified several anomalies in the process flow of Case ID 1002 and to a lesser extent, Case ID 1003 and 1004. Let me explain these anomalies in detail:

## 1. **Anomalous Sequence in Case ID 1002 (Major Anomaly)**

### Observed Sequence:
- Create Purchase Requisition
- Issue Purchase Order
- Vendor Invoice Received
- Release Payment
- **Approve Purchase Requisition** (after payment)
- Receive Goods
- Match Invoice to PO

### Issues:
1. **Approving Purchase Requisition After Payment**: The most significant anomaly is that the "Approve Purchase Requisition" activity occurs after the "Release Payment". In a standard P2P process, purchase requisition approval is one of the first steps, and typically precedes any financial commitments like issuing a purchase order or making a payment.

2. **Payment Before Receiving Goods**: The "Release Payment" activity occurs before "Receive Goods", which is problematic. In standard P2P processes, payment is usually made after the goods have been received and the invoice has been matched to the purchase order and delivery note.

3. **Invoice Received Before Goods**: While not as severe as the others, receiving the vendor invoice before the goods are received is atypical. Typically, goods are received first, then the invoice is matched to the goods receipt and PO.

### Why This Is Problematic:
- **Financial Risk**: Paying before receiving goods increases the risk of non-delivery or delivery of incorrect goods.
- **Lack of Approval**: Approving a requisition after payment has been made suggests a breakdown in internal controls and procurement governance.
- **Ineffective Three-Way Matching**: The "Match Invoice to PO" activity occurs after payment, which undermines the purpose of three-way matching (PO, goods receipt, and invoice).

## 2. **Anomalous Timing in Case ID 1003 (Minor Anomaly)**

### Observed Sequence:
- Create Purchase Requisition
- Approve Purchase Requisition
- Issue Purchase Order
- **Release Payment** (before receiving invoice or goods)
- Vendor Invoice Received
- Receive Goods
- Match Invoice to PO

### Issues:
1. **Payment Before Invoice and Goods**: The most notable issue is that payment is released before the invoice is received and before the goods are received. This is a deviation from standard P2P practices.

### Why This Is Problematic:
- **Lack of Verification**: Paying before receiving the invoice and goods means there's no verification of what was ordered or what was delivered.
- **Increased Fraud Risk**: This sequence could indicate a potential for fraud or an internal control weakness.

## 3. **Unusual Order of Events in Case ID 1004 (Minor Anomaly)**

### Observed Sequence:
- Create Purchase Requisition
- Approve Purchase Requisition
- **Receive Goods Before Issue Purchase Order**: This is the most unusual aspect of this case.
- Issue Purchase Order (after goods received)
- Vendor Invoice Received
- Match Invoice to PO
- Release Payment

### Issues:
1. **Goods Received Before Purchase Order**: Receiving goods before issuing a purchase order is highly unusual and problematic in standard P2P processes.

### Why This Is Problematic:
- **Lack of Authorization**: Receiving goods without a purchase order means there's no formal authorization for the purchase, which can lead to procurement without proper approvals.
- **Accounting Challenges**: It can create challenges in matching the goods receipt to a specific purchase order, complicating the three-way matching process.

## Summary of Anomalies

| Case ID | Anomaly Description | Severity |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| 1002 | Approval after payment, payment before goods receipt | High |
| 1003 | Payment before invoice and goods receipt | Medium |
| 1004 | Goods received before purchase order | Medium |

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate Case ID 1002**: This case shows the most significant deviations from standard P2P practices and should be prioritized for investigation to determine if it was an error or a potential fraud risk.

2. **Review Approval Workflows**: The sequence in Case ID 1002 suggests a flaw in the approval workflow. Ensure that purchase requisitions are always approved before any financial commitments are made.

3. **Reinforce Payment Controls**: All cases show the need for stronger controls to ensure payments are only made after goods have been received and invoices have been properly matched.

4. **Train Procurement Staff**: Provide training on standard P2P practices to ensure that all staff understand the proper sequence of activities and the importance of controls at each stage.

5. **Implement Process Monitoring**: Use process mining or other monitoring tools to detect such anomalies in real-time and prevent them from occurring in the future.

By addressing these anomalies, the organization can improve its procurement efficiency, reduce financial risk, and ensure compliance with standard business practices.
