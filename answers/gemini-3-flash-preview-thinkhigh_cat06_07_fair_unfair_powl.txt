Below are the two POWL models constructed in Python using the `pm4py` library.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model includes an `XOR` branch after the skill assessment. One branch represents the standard cultural fit evaluation, while the other represents the "CommunityAffiliationCheck," which allows for implicit bias based on local or club memberships.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_test = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
comm_affil = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
mgr_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define Loop for Data Completeness
# Logic: Check data, if incomplete, request more info and check again.
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Define XOR for Cultural Fit (The Bias Point)
# Logic: Either standard check OR the biased community affiliation path.
eval_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, comm_affil])

# Define the Workflow Order
nodes = [receive_app, data_loop, skill_test, eval_xor, mgr_review, final_decision]
model_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Add Edges to define the sequence
model_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
model_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_test)
model_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_test, eval_xor)
model_unfair.order.add_edge(eval_xor, mgr_review)
model_unfair.order.add_edge(mgr_review, final_decision)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness
This model removes the preferential `XOR` branch. Every candidate follows the exact same sequence of steps, ensuring that the "CommunityAffiliationCheck" cannot bypass or supplement the standard merit-based evaluation.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_test = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
mgr_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define Loop for Data Completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Define the Workflow Order (No XOR branch here)
nodes = [receive_app, data_loop, skill_test, cultural_fit, mgr_review, final_decision]
model_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Add Edges to define the sequence
model_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
model_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_test)
model_fair.order.add_edge(skill_test, cultural_fit)
model_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, mgr_review)
model_fair.order.add_edge(mgr_review, final_decision)
```

### Key Differences in the Models:
*   **The XOR Choice:** In the first model, `eval_xor` introduces a structural decision point where an applicant might be routed through a `CommunityAffiliationCheck`. This represents the "Potential Bias Point" described in the text.
*   **Uniformity:** In the second model, the `XOR` operator is removed entirely. The workflow becomes a strictly sequential process (after the initial data loop), ensuring that `CulturalFitCheck` is the uniform standard for all applicants, regardless of their background or local affiliations.
