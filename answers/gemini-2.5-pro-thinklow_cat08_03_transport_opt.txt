Of course. As a Process Mining Consultant, here is a comprehensive approach to analyze and optimize Speedy Parcels' operations.

### **Process Mining Analysis & Optimization Plan for Speedy Parcels**

**Executive Summary:**
Speedy Parcels is facing challenges with on-time delivery and rising operational costs. The available event data from GPS, scanners, dispatch, and maintenance logs is a rich source for a data-driven transformation. By applying process mining, we can move from suspicion to certainty, visualizing the *actual* delivery processes, pinpointing the precise sources of inefficiency, and creating targeted, measurable optimization strategies. This plan outlines a five-step approach: 1) Discovering the true process, 2) Analyzing performance, 3) Conducting root cause analysis, 4) Proposing concrete optimizations, and 5) Establishing continuous monitoring.

### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

This foundational phase focuses on creating a single source of truth about the delivery process and comparing it to the planned operations.

**Data Preprocessing and Integration:**

The first step is to transform the raw data from four separate systems into a unified event log suitable for analysis.

*   **Case ID:** The `Vehicle-Day` (e.g., `V12-20241205`) is an excellent primary Case ID. It represents a single, complete operational process instance from the start of a shift to its end. For more granular analysis, we can also use `Package ID` as a Case ID to trace the journey of a single parcel.
*   **Activity:** This requires careful definition by combining data sources. For instance:
    *   `Depart Depot` is a clear event from the scanner/GPS.
    *   **"Travel to Stop"** can be defined as the activity between a `Depart Customer` (or `Depart Depot`) event and the next `Arrive Customer` event.
    *   **"Service at Stop"** is the duration between `Arrive Customer` and `Depart Customer` scans.
    *   **"Traffic Delay"** can be automatically detected by creating rules (e.g., GPS-reported speed < 10 km/h for > 3 minutes on a major thoroughfare outside a delivery zone).
    *   **"Unscheduled Stop"** can be inferred if a vehicle is idle for more than 5 minutes at a location not associated with a planned delivery or the depot.
*   **Timestamp:** All timestamps must be standardized to a single format and time zone (e.g., UTC) to ensure correct sequencing.
*   **Attributes:** Other columns like `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Location`, `Package ID`, and `Notes` will be kept as event attributes, allowing for powerful filtering and dimensional analysis.

**Challenges to Anticipate:**
*   **Data Synchronization:** Device clocks (GPS vs. Scanner) may have a slight drift. We will need to apply logic to align events that should occur sequentially (e.g., `Arrive Customer` scan should not be before the vehicle GPS reports arriving at the location).
*   **Data Noise & Gaps:** GPS signals can be lost in tunnels or "urban canyons," creating gaps. We will use interpolation techniques to fill minor gaps and flag major ones for investigation.
*   **Defining "Stops":** Differentiating between a delivery stop, a traffic jam stop, and a driver's personal break requires robust rule-based logic combining location, duration, and scanner data.

**Process Discovery:**

Using an algorithm like the **Inductive Miner**, we will generate a process map from the event log. This map will visually represent the end-to-end delivery process as it *actually happens*. Initially, it will likely be a complex "spaghetti model," but it will reveal:
*   The main flow from `Depart Depot` -> `Travel` -> `Service at Stop` -> `Return to Depot`.
*   Common variations, such as loops for `Delivery Failed` attempts.
*   Deviations like `Unscheduled Stop` or `Vehicle Breakdown`.
*   The frequency of each path, highlighting the most and least common process variants.

**Conformance Checking:**

This is where we compare reality to the plan.
*   **The "To-Be" Model:** The planned route sequence for each `Vehicle-Day` from the dispatch system serves as our reference model.
*   **Analysis:** We will use conformance checking algorithms to automatically detect and quantify deviations for every single case. We will specifically look for:
    *   **Sequence Deviations:** Drivers visiting stops in an order different from the plan. We can then investigate *why*—was it a smart driver choice to avoid traffic, or a mistake?
    *   **Unplanned Activities:** Identifying any stops or activities (e.g., long idle times, maintenance events) that were not in the dispatch plan.
    *   **Skipped Activities:** Deliveries that were planned but never attempted.
    *   **Timing Deviations:** Highlighting routes where the actual travel or service time was significantly longer (>20%, for example) than the planned estimate. This directly points to flaws in the planning assumptions.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

With a reliable process model, we can overlay performance data to identify where time and money are being lost.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

We will calculate the following KPIs directly from the event log attributes:
*   **On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate:** Percentage of successful deliveries where the `Delivery Success` timestamp falls within the customer's requested time window.
*   **Average Time per Stop (Service Time):** Calculated as `Timestamp(Depart Customer) - Timestamp(Arrive Customer)`. This can be drilled down by location type (residential vs. business).
*   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Total time spent traveling vs. total time at customer stops. A high ratio indicates routing or traffic issues.
*   **First-Attempt Delivery Rate (FADR):** Percentage of deliveries that are `Delivery Success` on the first attempt.
*   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** `(Shift Duration - Idle Time - Maintenance Time) / Shift Duration`.
*   **Fuel Consumption/Cost Proxy:** While direct fuel data might not be in the log, we can use **Total Idle Time** (engine on, vehicle not moving) and **Distance Traveled at Low Efficiency Speeds** as strong proxies for excess fuel burn.
*   **Frequency and Duration of Traffic Delays:** Count and sum the duration of auto-detected "Traffic Delay" activities.

**Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**

We will use the process mining tool's performance analysis features:
1.  **Activity Duration Overlay:** The process map will be color-coded to show which activities consume the most time on average. This will immediately highlight if the bottleneck is `Travel`, `Service at Stop`, or `Depot Loading`.
2.  **Bottleneck Animation:** We can replay the delivery days visually on a map, watching tokens (representing vehicles) get stuck in certain areas or during specific activities, providing an intuitive understanding of flow and friction.
3.  **Dimensional Analysis:** We will filter the process map and KPIs by different attributes to pinpoint the context of bottlenecks:
    *   **Time of Day:** Is travel time between 9-11 AM significantly worse than other periods?
    *   **Geographic Zones:** Are service times in the downtown core double those in the suburbs due to parking difficulties? We can visualize this on a geographic heat map.
    *   **Driver/Vehicle:** Is a specific group of drivers consistently slower? Do older vehicle models have more unscheduled maintenance stops?

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

This step digs deeper to understand the "why" behind the identified bottlenecks.

*   **Problem: Suboptimal Route Planning**
    *   **Root Cause Investigation:** We will use **variant analysis**. We'll compare the top 10% most efficient routes (lowest cost/time per delivery) against the bottom 10%. Do the best routes show drivers deviating from the plan in a beneficial way? Do the worst routes strictly follow an inefficient plan? Conformance checking will show if the planned routes consistently lead to higher-than-average travel times in specific corridors.
*   **Problem: High Rate of Failed Deliveries**
    *   **Root Cause Investigation:** We will analyze the activities *preceding* a `Delivery Failed` event. Is there a correlation with deliveries attempted at the edge of a time window? Do failed deliveries for certain areas (e.g., apartment buildings) have a much longer "Service at Stop" time, suggesting access issues?
*   **Problem: Impact of Traffic Congestion**
    *   **Root Cause Investigation:** We will correlate the "Traffic Delay" events with specific road segments and times of day. This allows us to build a historical, internal traffic model that is more accurate for delivery vans than generic GPS app data. This can expose that the dispatch system's travel time estimates are systematically flawed.
*   **Problem: High Vehicle Operational Costs**
    *   **Root Cause Investigation:** We will analyze the frequency, duration, and cause of `Unscheduled Maintenance` events. We'll correlate these events with vehicle age, model, and mileage (calculated from GPS). We can also analyze driver behavior by comparing metrics like harsh braking or speeding events (if available from GPS) with maintenance frequency to see if driving style impacts vehicle health.
*   **Problem: High Variability in Service Time**
    *   **Root Cause Investigation:** By analyzing the `Service at Stop` duration, we can segment by package size, location type (business vs. residential), and time of day. This might reveal that deliveries to multi-tenant office buildings without a receiving dock are a major, previously unquantified, time sink.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

Based on the analysis, we propose the following concrete strategies:

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Territory and Route Sequence Optimization**
*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Suboptimal routes, excessive travel time, traffic delays.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Static route plans that don't reflect real-world traffic patterns and service time realities.
*   **Proposal:** Use the historical travel time data derived from process mining to re-draw delivery territories, ensuring a more balanced workload. Feed the discovered, hyper-accurate travel time estimates (e.g., "This road segment on a Tuesday at 10 AM takes 12 minutes, not the 5 minutes in Google Maps") back into the dispatch system. For route sequencing, the system can now generate smarter plans.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Improved OTD Rate, reduced Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio, lower fuel costs.

**Strategy 2: Proactive Customer Communication to Reduce Failed Deliveries**
*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Failed delivery attempts, re-delivery costs, customer dissatisfaction.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Customer not being home or available during the delivery attempt.
*   **Proposal:** Our analysis will identify the top predictors of a failed delivery (e.g., specific neighborhoods, time windows, package types). We can implement a system that sends an automated notification ("Your driver is 3 stops away, estimated arrival in 15-20 minutes") specifically to customers fitting this high-risk profile. This gives them a chance to prepare, reducing failed attempts.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Increased First-Attempt Delivery Rate (FADR), improved customer satisfaction, and reduced costs associated with re-delivery loops in the process.

**Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling and Driver Coaching**
*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Unscheduled vehicle downtime, high repair costs, driver-induced inefficiencies.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Reactive maintenance and variations in driver skill/behavior.
*   **Proposal:**
    *   **Maintenance:** Use the analysis of vehicle usage patterns (e.g., total km driven, idle hours, number of stops) and breakdown events to build a predictive model. The system can flag Vehicle V15 for a preemptive brake check because its usage profile matches vehicles that previously experienced brake failures.
    *   **Coaching:** Variant analysis will identify the exact behaviors of top-performing drivers (e.g., they spend 30 seconds less on average at each stop by organizing packages differently). These best practices can be quantified and used to create a targeted training program for other drivers, focusing on specific, data-backed behaviors rather than generic advice.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Reduced vehicle downtime, lower maintenance costs, improved Vehicle Utilization Rate, and standardized, higher-performing service times across the driver pool.

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

**Accounting for Constraints:**
All proposed strategies will be implemented within the boundaries of operational reality.
*   Route optimizations will respect **driver working hour regulations** (e.g., mandatory breaks, maximum shift length).
*   Dynamic routing will still operate within the defined **vehicle capacity**.
*   Customer communication strategies will respect **customer-defined time windows**, aiming to improve success *within* those windows.

**Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:**
Implementation is not the end. We will set up a series of live process mining dashboards for the operations manager.
*   **Daily Operations Dashboard:** This will track today's performance against the historical average for key KPIs (OTD Rate, FADR, Avg. Service Time). It will flag any `Vehicle-Day` case that is deviating significantly from the norm in real-time.
*   **Conformance Dashboard:** This will track the rate of conformance to new, optimized routes. Are drivers following the smarter plans? If not, why?
*   **Optimization Impact Dashboard:** This will track the KPIs targeted by our strategies over weeks and months to prove ROI. For example, a chart showing the FADR before and after the implementation of the proactive notification system.

This continuous feedback loop ensures that the optimizations are effective, allows for fine-tuning, and enables Speedy Parcels to proactively manage its operations using data, transforming into a truly efficient and reliable logistics provider.
