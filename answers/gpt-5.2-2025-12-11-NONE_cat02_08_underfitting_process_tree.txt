### 1) Example of an “invalid-but-accepted” trace

One concrete trace the given process tree would accept is:

**Receive_Order  Check_Inventory  Ship_Order  Authorize_Payment  Package_Items  Close_Order**

(Here the three activities inside `successful_subtree` are in **parallel**, so any interleaving/order of `Authorize_Payment`, `Package_Items`, and `Ship_Order` is accepted.)

### 2) Why this trace is problematic (domain violation)

From an Order-to-Cash perspective, **shipping before packaging** (and typically before payment authorization) is not acceptable:

- **Ship_Order before Package_Items** violates the physical/logical constraint that items must be packaged (or otherwise prepared) before they can be shipped.
- Often, **Ship_Order before Authorize_Payment** is also disallowed because the business usually requires payment authorization (or at least credit approval) prior to shipment.

The model allows this because it models the “successful path” as:

```text
PARALLEL(Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order)
```

A parallel operator imposes **no ordering constraints** between these activities, so it admits interleavings that are nonsensical in the real process—hence the underfitting.
