**Process Flow Description:**

**1. Start Event:**
   - **Event:** Invoice Received
   - **Trigger:** Invoice arrives, typically via email from Supplier.
   - **Performer:** AP Clerk receives.

**2. Activity:** Check for Purchase Order (PO)
   - **Performer:** AP Clerk (Mary)
   - **Description:** Manually checks if the received invoice contains a valid PO number.
   - **Input:** Invoice

**3. Gateway (Exclusive):** PO Number Present?
   - **Performer:** AP Clerk (Mary) makes the decision based on the check.
   - **Condition 1 (No):** If PO number is missing.
     - **Flow:** Sequence flow to "Handle Missing PO".
   - **Condition 2 (Yes):** If PO number is present.
     - **Flow:** Sequence flow to "Log Invoice in System".

**4. Activity:** Handle Missing PO (Exception Path 1)
   - **Performer:** AP Clerk (Mary)
   - **Description:** Sends the invoice back to the Supplier requesting the PO number or more details.
   - **Output:** Communication to Supplier.
   - **Flow:** Sequence flow potentially terminates this instance or awaits corrected invoice (leading back to Start Event).
   - **Note:** *Karen (Supplier Relationship Mgr) might also get involved here upon request to contact the supplier.*

**5. Activity:** Log Invoice in System

**7. Activity:** Check Invoice vs. PO & Goods Receipt
   - **Performer:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)
   - **Description:** Compares invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) against the corresponding PO and implicitly confirms goods/services were received (though the receipt confirmation step isn't explicitly detailed, Dan's check serves this purpose).
   - **Input:** Request from AP, Invoice Details, PO Details

**8. Gateway (Exclusive):** Invoice Details Match PO/Receipt?
   - **Performer:** Purchasing Officer (Dan) makes the decision.
   - **Condition 1 (Yes):** If invoice details align with PO and receipt.
     - **Flow:** Sequence flow to "Send Confirmation to AP".

**12. Activity:** Trigger Manager Approval
    - **Performer:** Accounting System (initiated by AP Clerk action/status update post-matching)
    - **Description:** System automatically sends a notification/request for approval to the relevant Department Manager.
    - **Input:** Matched Invoice Record, PO Details, Purchasing Confirmation
    - **Output:** Approval Request Notification (to Manager)

**13. Activity:** Review Invoice for Approval
    - **Performer:** Department Manager (Carlos)
    - **System:** Accounting System (likely interface)
    - **Description:** Reviews the invoice details, PO, confirmation, and budget alignment.

**17. End Event:**
    - **Event:** Invoice Scheduled for Payment
    - **Description:** The standard process concludes for this invoice regarding approval; payment execution follows separately.

**Exception/Alternate Paths:**

**E1. Activity:** Resolve Purchasing Discrepancy (from Gateway 8 - No)
   - **Performers:** Purchasing Officer (Dan), potentially Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen), Supplier (External)
   - **Description:** Purchasing investigates the discrepancy. May involve contacting the supplier directly (Dan/Karen) or requesting AP (Mary) to hold the invoice while waiting for a corrected version from the supplier.
   - **Input:** Discrepancy Details
   - **Output:** Corrected Information/Invoice *OR* Clarification *OR* Escalation to AP Supervisor.
   - **Flow:** Upon resolution (e.g., receiving corrected invoice or clarification), flow may loop back to **Activity 7 (Check Invoice vs. PO)** or proceed to **Activity 9 (Send Confirmation to AP)** if the issue is resolved favorably. If unresolved, may trigger escalation **(E3)**.

**E2. Activity:** Resolve AP Matching Discrepancy (from Gateway 11 - No)
   - **Performers:** AP Clerk (Mary), potentially Purchasing Officer (Dan), AP Supervisor (Rita), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen), Supplier (External)
   - **Description:** AP Clerk emails Purchasing for clarification first. If unresolved easily, escalates to AP Supervisor (Rita). May involve Karen contacting the supplier for pricing/PO issues.
   - **Input:** Discrepancy Details
   - **Output:** Clarification *OR* Corrected Information *OR* Decision from Supervisor.
   - **Flow:** Upon resolution, flow likely loops back to **Activity 10 (Match Invoice Lines)** or proceeds directly to **Activity 12 (Trigger Manager Approval)** if the match is now confirmed. If escalated, follows **E3**.

**E3. Activity:** Handle Escalated Issue / Non-Standard Invoice (Escalation)
   - **Performers:** AP Supervisor (Rita), potentially Department Manager (Carlos), Purchasing Officer (Dan), AP Clerk (Mary)
   - **Description:** AP Supervisor investigates complex discrepancies escalated from AP Clerk (E2) or Purchasing (E1). Also handles special cases like invoices without any PO (e.g., informal service contracts). May coordinate between departments, contact suppliers, or work with department heads to create retrospective POs.
   - **Input:** Escalated Issue Details, Invoice
   - **Output:** Resolution Path (e.g., Create Retro PO, Reject Invoice, Provide Clarification)
   - **Flow:** Depending on resolution:
     - If resolved and can proceed: Flow returns to the standard process, likely before the step that caused the failure (e.g., back to **Activity 10** or **Activity 12**).
     - If requires retrospective PO: May trigger a sub-process for PO creation, then loop back.
     - If rejected: Leads to a process termination/End Event (Invoice Rejected).

**E4. Activity:** Handle Manager Rejection/Query (from Gateway 14 - No)
   - **Performers:** Department Manager (Carlos), AP Clerk (Mary)
   - **Description:** Manager rejects the invoice or asks AP (Mary) to hold it and investigate further. Investigation may involve looping back to Purchasing or contacting the supplier via appropriate channels (Karen/Dan/Mary).
   - **Input:** Rejection Reason/Query
   - **Output:** Investigated Findings *OR* Invoice Hold Status.
   - **Flow:** Depending on findings:
     - If resolved satisfactorily: May loop back to **Activity 13 (Review Invoice for Approval)**.
     - If requires correction: May loop back to earlier steps like **Activity 10** or involve discrepancy handling (**E1/E2**).
     - If ultimately rejected: Leads to a process termination/End Event (Invoice Rejected).

**Key Artifacts/Data Objects:**

*   Invoice (Document/Data)
*   Purchase Order (PO) (Data/Reference)
*   Logged Invoice Record (System Data)
*   Confirmation Message (Email/System Notification)
*   Approval Request (System Notification)
*   Approved/Rejected Status (System Data)
*   Scheduled Payment Record (System Data)

---

**Potential Ambiguities/Consolidations:**

*   **Initial PO Check:** Mary states she checks first. Dan mentions telling Mary if PO is missing *when he receives it*, implying it might sometimes get past Mary's initial check or the check occurs differently. The model assumes Mary's initial check is standard.
*   **Goods Receipt Confirmation:** The exact mechanism for confirming goods receipt isn't fully detailed but seems integrated into Dan's check ("confirm that the goods or services were actually received" - Mary; Dan checks quantities/delivery).
*   **System Interaction:** The level of system automation vs. manual emails is inferred (e.g., system notification for manager approval is mentioned, others like forwarding to Purchasing might be manual email or system task).
*   **Discrepancy Handling:** The exact sequence for contacting suppliers (Directly by Dan? Via Karen? Via Mary?) during discrepancy resolution varies slightly between accounts. The model includes the possibilities mentioned.
