Process cubes offer an advanced perspective on process data that extends beyond what traditional process mining techniques can provide. Traditional approaches, such as statecharts, are effective for understanding how processes evolve over time but often lack the detailed granularity needed to capture and analyze multiple dimensions of each process instance at a high level.

Process cubes aim to remedy this by offering a way to represent and manipulate data in ways that allow for an in-depth analysis across multiple dimensions. For example, process cubes can be used to represent the relationships between:

1. The beginning and end states of processes.
2. Events occurring within those states.
3. Changes during each state.
4. The interaction patterns between different paths.

The structure of a process cube represents this information in a tabular form where each row or column corresponds to one distinct way of looking at the data captured by the mining process.

**Key benefits of Process Cubes:**

1. **Flexibility**: They can handle complex relationships and interactions between multiple aspects of processes.
2. **In-depth Analysis**: Unlike statecharts which might miss patterns related to parallelism, timing, interaction effects across states, or other contextual information.
3. **Visualization Tools**: They often come equipped with visualization tools to make the data more accessible through interactive graphs and charts.

**Comparison vs Traditional Approaches:**

1. **Historical View versus Context Awareness**: Process cubes offer greater context when analyzing processes by combining temporal elements (like sequence of state changes) with contextual data.
   
   - **Statecharts**, as an example, are excellent for understanding the evolution of states in a process but lack comprehensive views that include events during transitions or interactions between different paths.

2. **Flexibility in Data Mining**: Process cubes can more readily handle and summarize large volumes of complex relationships and multiple aspects of processes compared to traditional data mining approaches.
   
   - Traditional methods like APD (Automatic Polymorphic Decomposition) or statecharts might struggle with the intricate patterns that process cubes address efficiently.

3. **Decision Support**: Unlike historical analysis tools which simply provide a static overview, Process Cubes are better suited for dynamic decision-making in an analytics world where processes can vary significantly between instances.

In summary, while traditional process mining techniques excel at providing clarity on how processes evolve over time as a whole, their limitations in capturing detailed interactions and relationships make them less effective at fully understanding the complexity present within a single data instance. Process cubes offer a more sophisticated way of dealing with these data complexities by giving users a richer and more flexible view than what statecharts can provide.
