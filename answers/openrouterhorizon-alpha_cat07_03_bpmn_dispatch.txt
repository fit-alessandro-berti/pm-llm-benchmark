This is a BPMN swimlane diagram showing a company’s shipping preparation process across two lanes: “Dispatch of goods/Computer Hardware Shop Secretary” and “Warehouse,” with “Logistics” as an external pool.

Main flow:
- Start: Ship goods.
- Gateway to “Clarify shipment method,” then an exclusive decision “Special handling?”
  - If no: go to “Check if insurance is required” (uses customer information). If insurance is needed, branch to “Insure parcel,” then rejoin.
  - From insurance check, continue to “Write package label.”
  - Parallel to labeling, if special handling = yes: “Get 3 offers from logistic companies,” then “Select logistic company and place order,” joining later.
- After labeling and/or selection, an exclusive gateway merges into a parallel join that synchronizes with warehouse work.

Warehouse lane:
- “Package goods” starts early; there’s an attached timer (48 hours) leading to “Notify customer about delay,” which then rejoins before the parallel join.
- After synchronization, proceed to “Fill out shipment paperwork,” then “Move package to pickup area.”

End: “Shipment prepared.”

Key elements:
- Data objects: Order details, Customer information.
- Events/gateways: exclusive decisions for special handling and merging, parallel join, intermediate timer boundary event on packaging, and conditional flow for insurance.
- Outcome: a prepared shipment ready for pickup after necessary labeling, insurance, logistics selection, packaging, and paperwork.
