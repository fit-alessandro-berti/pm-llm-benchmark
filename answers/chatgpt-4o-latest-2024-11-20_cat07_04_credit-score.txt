The provided visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** that depicts the workflow of a credit scoring system, involving interactions between three swimlanes: 

1. **Credit Scoring (Internet Domain)**: Represents incoming scoring requests.
2. **Credit Scoring (Bank)**: Handles the request processing and communicates with the scoring service.
3. **Scoring Service**: Computes the credit score and sends updates back to the bank.

### Description of the Workflow

---

#### Lane: **Credit Scoring (Internet Domain)**
- The process begins with a **scoring request received** event. This appears to forward the request to the bank's scoring system.

---

#### Lane: **Credit Scoring (Bank)**
1. **Request Credit Score**: Upon receiving the request, the bank system sends a request for a credit score to the scoring service.
2. **Parallel Paths**: Two paths stem from this point:
   - **Delay Management**:
     - If delay information is received, a "Report Delay" step is triggered to log/report the delay.
   - **Credit Score Handling**:
     - If the "Credit Score Received" event is triggered, a check is performed. If valid, the process proceeds to "Send Credit Score," marking the scoring request as handled.
3. The process ends after the request is handled.

#### Lane: **Scoring Service**
1. **Compute Credit Score (Level 1)**:
   - The service attempts to compute the credit score.
   - A decision point checks if the score is available:
     - If **YES**, the computed score is sent back to the bank.
     - If **NO**, the delay is reported, and **Compute Credit Score (Level 2)** is executed.
2. **Compute Credit Score (Level 2)**:
   - This represents an additional or advanced scoring computation attempt. Once completed, the updated score is sent back to the bank.
3. The process ends after the scoring completion.

### Key Features:
- **Events and Activities**:
  - Circular icons represent events (e.g., sending/receiving messages, delays).
  - Rectangles depict activities or tasks performed by the system.
- **Decision Points**:
  - Diamonds denote conditional branching to handle different cases (e.g., score availability).
- **Message Queues**:
  - The dotted lines indicate inter-lane messages/communication.

This diagram models a systematic approach to synchronizing client requests, managing delays, and ensuring credit score availability for decision-making in a decentralized system.
