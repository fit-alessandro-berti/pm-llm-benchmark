Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative rules clearly from Part 1. The process has a strict sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case. There are specific ordering constraints like Credit Check before Risk Assessment and so on.

Looking at each case in the event log:

**Case 1:** 
The activities follow the exact order. After Application Received, it does Credit Check first, then Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, then Close Case. No steps skipped or out of order. So this seems compliant with normative rules.

**Case 2:**
Here, after Application Received, there's a Risk Assessment before the required Credit Check. That violates the ordering rule where Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then, despite the rejection, Finalize Documentation is done before closing the case, which is explicitly not allowed for rejections. Both these actions are normative violations.

**Case 3:**
The sequence seems okay: Application Received  Credit Check after a delay (24 hours)  other steps follow in order. However, Credit Check is delayed beyond the recommended time window (24 hours), and Informing Applicant happens much later than 48 hours after decision. Also, there's no Follow-up Call mentioned as per desiderata. These are all desideratum violations because they don't meet the timing recommendations or optional best practices.

Now for part 2 about desiderata: Case 3 has several of these issues but none that break the strict rules. So I need to note those as suboptimal behaviors.

Lastly, possible justifications could include system constraints (like in Case 3 maybe there was a backlog), or errors in process handling causing violations. However, without more context, it's hard to justify normative rule breaches directly.

**Part 1: Normative Rule Violations**

Case **2** violates the strict process rules in two significant ways:
- The **Risk Assessment** activity is performed before the required **Credit Check**, which explicitly breaks the ordering constraint that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment
- Following a loan rejection, there's an unauthorized attempt to perform **Finalize Documentation** before closing the case, directly contradicting the requirement that documentation finalization should only occur for approved loans

These violations cannot be justified within the given constraints and represent serious process deviations.

**Part 2: Desiderata Violations**

Case **3** exhibits several instances of suboptimal behavior:
- A significant delay (48 hours) between Application Received and Credit Check, exceeding the recommended 24-hour window
- Informing the applicant takes place on day 5 after the loan decision (January 16), far beyond the suggested 48-hour timeframe for notification
- No Follow-up Call is conducted before case closure, missing an optional but recommended quality assurance step

These deviations while not violating strict rules, suggest potential inefficiencies in process management.

**Interpretations/Justifications:**
While normative violations (Case 2) cannot be excused under the given constraints, desiderata issues might have reasonable explanations:
- In Case 3's delays, system backlogs or resource constraints could explain the Credit Check delay
- The Inform Applicant timing issue might reflect prioritization of other cases over this one

However, these interpretations don't validate the normative violations in Case 2; they simply offer context for understanding the desiderata deviations in Case 3.
