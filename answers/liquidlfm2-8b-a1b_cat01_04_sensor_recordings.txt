# Process Mining-Informed Activity Labeling from Manufacturing Event Log

## Step 1: Review and Understand Event Patterns

The log samples machine sensor data over time, capturing:

- **Temperature**: changes indicate operational intensity (e.g., rising heat during cutting or welding).  
- **Pressure**: steady or moderate levels likely correspond to normal or assembling phases (e.g., pression at 1–2 bar during part assembly).  
- **Vibration Level (Hz)**: low vibration indicates stable operation; sudden spikes suggest dynamic or high-force tasks (e.g., cutting or welding).  
- **Material Flow Rate**: low or zero flow often corresponds to idle or positioning phases (e.g., tool moving away from workpiece).  
- **Tool Position**: movement toward/from machine center indicates active machining or reassignment.  
- **Energy Consumption**: increased usage correlates with active operation (e.g., cutting, welding).

## Step 2: Identify and Group Events by Behavioral Phases

Based on the numerical shifts across events, we can identify distinct operational phases:

### Phase A: **Assembly (Events 1–10)**  
- **Temperature:** slowly rising from 20°C  30–55°C (noticeable spike at event 9)  
- **Pressure:** stable at 1 bar with gradual increases  reflects gradually engaging tools  
- **Vibration:** low 0–10 Hz  minimal dynamic force  
- **Material Flow:** near-zero  machine stationary/tool in host position  
- **Tool Position:** mostly zero  tool moves out or to prep  
- **Energy:** low (0.40–2.50 kWh)  

**Pattern:** Transition from idle  tool engaged  steady moderate operation  increases in temperature and vibration with event 9 support sustained cutting/welding actions.

*Label: Assembling Parts*  
**Rationale:** The initial slow thermal/mechanical warm-up with stable pressure and minimal vibration is typical of preparing and securing components. The spike in temperature and vibration around event 9 indicates active cutting or welding, consistent with mechanical stress and energy demand.

### Phase B: **Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)**  
- **Temperature:** sharp rise from 50°C  58°C  55°C  
- **Pressure:** steady 1–1.5 bar  
- **Vibration:** significant increase from 30Hz  35–38Hz (sharp spike)  
- **Material Flow:** 5 units/s (tool engaging workpiece)  
- **Tool Position:** increases to 7–10 mm (tool moves down/machining distance)  
- **Energy:** jumps to 2.00–3.00 kWh (high energy use)  

**Pattern:** Sudden high energy + vibration + moderate heating align with intense cutting forces requiring elevated thermal and mechanical load. The tool moves visibly during machining.

*Label: Cutting Metal*  
**Rationale:** The distinct thermal spike and strong vibration, together with steady flow and high energy draw, pinpoint a high-demand cutting operation where tools engage metal at elevated power.

---

### Phase C: **Post-Cutting Transition / Idle/Qual checking (Events 7–12)**  
- **Temperature:** drops to pre-cutting levels (~40–21°C)  
- **Pressure:** remains ~1–2 bar  
- **Vibration:** returns to low ~10 Hz  
- **Material Flow:** drops to 2 units/s  tool repositioned  
- **Tool Position:** significantly reduces movement (1520 mm)  
- **Energy:** minimal (1.00–1.60 kWh)  

**Pattern:** Declining thermal and vibration vibration indicate cooling and shutdown readiness. Continuous low flow reflects stationary or precision positioning phase, possibly for inspection or retooling.

*Label: Quality Inspection or Preparation for Next Phase (Packaging not evident here)*  
**Rationale:** The sharp drop in energy and vibration, combined with steady tool position and moderate cooling, suggests a transition: after cutting, the machine enters inspection, recalibration, or repositioning. No direct flow or energy for packaging, but this phase prepares for the next assembly step—possibly aligned with brief quality checks.

## Step 3: Final Label Assignment with Explanation

| Activity              | Events Grouped | Supporting Sensor Patterns                                                                            | Label Rationale                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Assembling Parts**   | Events 1–10    | Gradual temperature rise, zero flow, moderate stable vibration, steady low creep energy over time    | Represents tool engagement and preparation for machining—consistent with stable initial operability, building to cutting. |
| **Cutting Metal**      | Events 4–6     | Sharp temperature spike, elevated vibration (30–38 Hz), increasing material flow, high energy draw    | Characterized by intense thermal and mechanical load, confirming high-demand cutting operation.       |
| **Transition / Inspection** | Events 7–12     | Declining temperature, vibration, near-zero flow, tool delivers to idle position, low minimal energy  | Indicates post-processing: cooling down and preparing for next cycle, likely inspection or repositioning. |

## Summary

This process mapping interprets raw sensor data as phase transitions in a manufacturing workflow. The inferred activities—**Assembling Parts**, **Cutting Metal**, and a **Transition/Inspection Phase**—reflect typical operational steps. The patterns align with physical sensor behaviors during industrial tasks: gradual warmup, peak industrial stress during cutting, and eventual shutdown/preparation for next step.

No explicit packaging phase is evident from these events; further log data would be needed to confirm final quality checks or packaging. However, the dominant behavioral sequence defines a clear process flow that maps directly to core manufacturing operations.
