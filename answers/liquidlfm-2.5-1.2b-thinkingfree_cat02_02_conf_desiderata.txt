Okay, let's tackle this. I need to figure out which cases are violating the normative rules and which ones fail the desiderata, then explain why and suggest interpretations. 

Starting with Part 1 (Normative Process Behavior). The key points are the strict sequence without skipping steps, correct order between certain activities, and the restrictions based on whether loan was approved or rejected. 

Looking at the event log provided: 

Looking at case 2: The first activity after Analysis is Credit Check? Wait, no, case 2 starts with Application Received again? Wait wait no. Wait case 2 starts as Application Received again? Wait no, looking at row 2's first entry is Application Received again? Wait original table: the first entry is Case 1's activity 1: Application Received. Then row 2: Case 2 starts with 2024-01-11 08:00 Application Received again? Wait there's two cases numbered 1 and 2. Wait maybe the first case is Case 1 and second is Case 2?

Wait looking at the table, row 2 is for Case 2, which has an Activity "Application Received" again? Oh wait that must be an error. Wait wait no, let me parse the data again carefully. The rows are labeled Case ID 1 and 2. Let me check the rows. 

Row 2 starts with 2024-01-11 08:00 Activity: Application Received. But Case 1 ended with Close Case at 13:30, then Case 2 starts again with Application Received? That can't be right. Wait maybe I misread the data. Wait the Case ID 2 must be a separate case. Wait maybe there were two cases, but perhaps case 2 is conflicting because after case 1's Close Case at 13:30, Case 2's Application is received again, which shouldn't happen unless it's the same process? Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but assuming the data is correct, perhaps it's part of its own flow. 

Alternatively, perhaps Case 2 starts fresh. Maybe there are two separate instance of Case 1 and 2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first entry is Case 1, then the second case is Case 2. Anyway, the problem is in the table. Let's look for any steps that are out of order.

Looking at any violations: 

Rule says Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. In row 2, activity after Application Received is Credit Check (since row 2's first after initial entry is Credit Check?), Wait looking at rows 2's activities: first row is 1's activities up to Close Case at 13:30. Case2's first activity is Application Received again? That might be an inconsistency. Maybe this occurrence is allowed because perhaps starting again? Maybe I should focus on the steps between steps.

The critical violations in row 2 would be: The case ID 2 has Activity "Application Received" after Case 1's Close Case (since Case1 ended at 13:30, and then Case2 starts at 8:00 next day? Maybe it's a mistake, but assuming the first case is 1, next is Case2 starting again early. Not sure, but perhaps we can skip getting stuck here. Let's proceed methodically.

First, check all steps in order. The normative steps must be in order Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Decision  Inform  Closing only after approved. 

In case 2's row shows it starts with Application Received again. Maybe the data has an issue, but perhaps ignoring that for now. Let's note possible violations: 

- In case 2, after Application Received, next is Credit Check. Wait wait, if the user starts with Application Received again, that's invalid because first step must be receiving application. The normative process says the first activity is Receiving the Application. So if a case starts with Application Received again, that violates the sequence, so it's starting with receiving again? That would be invalid. But perhaps in case of case2, maybe it's a repeat? Maybe the data is conflicting but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. 

Alternatively, maybe focus on other rules. For example, if the decision had to follow the Lender's sequence strictly. 

Looking further in the table: case 3 is Application Received again, which is bad. So the same issue. The main point is that in Case 3, after applying again, but the issue is the first activity is receipt again. So case 3 also violates the starting sequence.

Also, in row 2 (assuming that is a duplicate case 1?), in its steps: 

After Application Received comes Credit Check (so okay), then Risk Assessment, then Loan Decision Rejected (so the Step between Risk Assessment and Decision should be check info, but in this case, after Risk Assessment, comes Loan Decision Rejection. Wait, but the constraints say Risk Assessment must come before Loan Decision. Here, after Risk Assessment comes Loan Decision, which is correctly in time. 

But more importantly, after LDM Decision, the order requires that After Loan Decision comes Inform Applicant. 

In row 2's row (Case 2's row), after Loan Decision (Rejected), it tries to do Finalize Documentation before Close Case. That's a violation as per rule 3: Loan Decision’s post must be Inform Applicant before closing. Since rejected, closing should be after informing but before closing. Since Here the Loan Decision is 'Rejected', the next steps: 

After Loan Decision (Rejected), the step requires the Inform Applicant must be done after, but in row2, after Loan Decision, it tried to do Finalize Documentation before closing. Which is violating because they should inform first (though if rejected, maybe inform isn't needed. Wait actually, the normal flow says after Loan Decision (irrespective of decision), the Inform Applicant happens (only after Loan Decision which can be Rejected or Approved, then Inform. So if rejected, you can close case without finalizing, but need to inform? Wait the description says after Loan Decision is made (either way), Inform Applicant must occur after the decision. 

In case2's row: After Loan Decision (Rejected), it proceeds to Finalize Documentation immediately before closing. That's bad since you should inform first. So this is a violation if they skip Inform before closing. So this is a clear violation: after Loan Decision, must come Inform Applicant, then then close.

Another point: if it is Rejected, then closing the case must not finalize docs before closing. So the order must have Inform Applicant before Closing. Since in case 2 it's skipping that step before closing, it's violated. 

So case2 seems involved here. 

Other issues: In the example given, the rule says if approved then Finalize docs before closing. Which is needed here, but in case2, since it's rejected, Finalizing before closing is prohibited. Thus, in case 2 (assuming it's Case2's rows): the problem is not just that it's a repeat, but since it's starting with Application Received again, maybe it's invalid. 

Thus, for the first part (Part 1), violating cases are those that deviate from the sequence. For example, if a case starts with Application Received again (if like Case3), so any repeated start except exactly the first step? Also, if Credit Check is after Risk Assessment, but still this is more complex. 

For the second part, the desiderata allows some flexibility but not strictness. For instance, if case2's issue is violated timing but within allowed slessness, but in terms of the activity sequence like needing to follow strict steps. 

Now the Answer for part1 needs to identify which cases violate the normative rules. From the table examples, case 2's activity of starting over with Application could be a start violation. Also, if any case skips steps between steps like if Credit Check after Risk Assessments. Looking at case 3: starts with App Applied again but first activity is same as case1, but even worse than the first repetition: starting over with same steps again.

Looking at case3: The first activity is Application Received again. Clearly a violation of the strict sequence (starts with receive again). So all cases where the starting step is Application Received again are invalid. Similarly, as in case3, which starts with Application again after the first time, violating the sequence (it should just proceed from the Credit Check etc. steps. 

Another possible rule is that if Loan Decision comes before Risk Assessment? Check each case. In case3, assumed it follows same first steps. 

Now for the explanation why cases are violations: the key points are forcing strict sequence, no skips, and adherence to step order. 

Now for part2 (recommended but not strict), it's satisfied mostly except perhaps timing but not compromised. 

Putting this together: 

Part1 identifies cases violating the strict normative sequence. From table examples like case 3's start repetition, case2 possibly too. Suggest the violating cases can be like Case ID 2 (if that's the second case) and those starting again with Application Received or any case that doesn't start with receiving the application properly.

But since the table shows case3 starts again with application, which is a clear violation. 

The extract for answer: identifying cases like Case 2 (given it starts with Received) and any case starting with Received again. Since the user asks for which cases are violations, the main one is Case 2. Also Case 3 (if it's like a repetition plus another repeat). 

Then for part 1's answer: The violating cases are those where the first activity is not "Application Received", or where the sequence order is violated (like Credit Check before Risk assessment if they interfere, but perhaps more precisely starting steps not following). 

The question wants an answer explaining which cases violate, so in the explanation, list the examples.

Now structuring the answer: For Part 1, identify that cases starting with"Application Received" again or missing the first step are violations. Specifically, case2 starts with "Application Received" again, but perhaps more correctly, if every case that starts with Application is invalid unless it's the first. 

The answer should say that any case where the sequence starts with incorrect order, such as starting with "Application Received" again, violates the sequence. So Case ID 3 starts again with Application Received so it's invalid. 

Also, if any Loan Decision is made before Risk Assessment. For example, if a step skips Risk assessment before it's done. Like in case2 if after Application Received starts with Credit Check then Risk? Not exactly but if it skips steps. 

In terms of the final answer, I need to recall what exactly are the allowed. Since the user is asking for "which cases are violating", the answer will need to point out any case in the table following the sequence rules. 

Given the examples, case2 is doubly problematic, so it's likely one such case. The user might expect case3 also. 

Proceeding to write the answer.

</think>
### Part 1: Normative Process (Strict Rules)  
**Identification of Violations:**  
Cases that violate the normative process include:  
1. **Case 2**: Starting with "Application Received" again (after previously finalizing/closing the case).  
2. **Case 3**: Repeating the initial activity ("Application Received") after starting the process anew.  
3. **General Rule Violation**: Any deviation from the strict sequence (e.g., performing steps like Loan Decision before Risk Assessment).  

These cases directly breach the **"strict sequence" constraint**, "no skipping steps," and "must follow Ordering Rules."  

---

### Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)  
**Analysis:**  
While violating timing or process fidelity is tolerated, the deviations are framed as "recommended but non-critical." Key adjustments include:  
- Prompt Communication: Inform applicants *before* closing (e.g., within 48 hours) to avoid delays.  
- Follow-Up Calls: A gentle check-up ensures alignment, even if not strictly required.  

These actions support smooth progress but are permissible as additions rather than replacements.  

---

### Event Log Analysis (Tabular Summary)  
**Critical Observations:**  
- **Case 2** (listed above) violates strict sequence by restarting the process, disrupting continuity.  
- **Case 3** is invalidated for restarting "Application Received," though a minor repetition may not be severe but still infrequent enough to warrant correction.  
- **Case 2** also risks dropping the timeline constraints outlined (e.g., informing the applicant prematurely (as Finalize Documentation occurs before closing), which violates the **"Inform Applicant Must occur after Loan Decision" rule**.  

---

### Summary of Insights  
- **Violations of Normative Rules**: Cases violating the sequence or step orders (e.g., Case 2).  
- **Recommended Adjustments**: Timely communication and alignment checks (Desiderata).  
- **Acceptable Flexibility**: Timeliness/interaction nudges are acceptable but not mandated by the strict rules.  

These observations align with the framework provided, balancing adherence to core obligations while acknowledging tolerable deferments.
