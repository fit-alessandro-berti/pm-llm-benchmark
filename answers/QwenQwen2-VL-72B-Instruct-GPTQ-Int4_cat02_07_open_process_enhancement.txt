Process enhancement is a stage in the process mining lifecycle that aims to identify opportunities for improving a process by analyzing the discovered process model and comparing it to an existing process model.

In process discovery, the goal is to extract a process model from event logs, which represents the actual behavior of the process. The resulting process model may not be optimal or efficient, and there may be room for improvement.

Conformance checking, on the other hand, compares a discovered process model with a reference or ideal model to identify deviations or discrepancies between the two.

Process enhancement builds on the insights gained from process discovery and conformance checking to identify areas for improvement and suggest changes to the process model. This involves analyzing the discovered process model and comparing it to the reference model to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and other areas for improvement. The enhanced process model may then be implemented and tested to evaluate its effectiveness.

In summary, process enhancement is a stage in the process mining lifecycle that aims to identify opportunities for improving a process by analyzing the discovered process model and comparing it to an existing process model. It differs from process discovery and conformance checking in that it focuses on identifying areas for improvement and suggesting changes to the process model.
