First, I need to write a DuckDB SQL query that excludes events from cases that have a specific sequence of activities and meet a timing condition. The sequence is: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' followed by 'Confirm Order', with no other events in between. Additionally, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' must be more than 5 days. I need to return all events except those from cases that satisfy both the sequence and the timing.

The steps are:

1. Identify cases that have the exact sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' with no other events in between.

2. Among those cases, filter for those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

3. Exclude these cases from the final result.

4. Return all events from cases that do not meet the above criteria.

I need to think about how to detect the sequence in SQL. Since DuckDB supports window functions, I might use them to compare consecutive events.

A common approach is to use LEAD or LAG window functions to get the next activity and compare.

I can assign a row number to events within each case ordered by timestamp. Then, for each event, I can check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next activity is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

But I need to ensure that there are no other events in between. So, if I use LEAD twice, I can get the next and the next-next activity.

Let me define the sequence as events where:

- Event i has activity 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

- Event i+1 has activity 'Create Order'

- Event i+2 has activity 'Confirm Order'

And since we're ordering by timestamp, these should be consecutive if there are no events with the same timestamp or if we handle ties, but I should assume that timestamps are distinct or handle ordering properly. To be safe, I'll order by timestamp and if there are ties, it might not be perfect, but I'll proceed with ordering by timestamp.

In process mining, timestamps might have milliseconds, so it should be fine. I'll order by case_id and timestamp.

Now, for the timing condition, I need the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'. So, for each sequence, I need to compute the difference in days between the timestamp of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.

Then, I need to flag cases that have at least one such sequence where the time difference is more than 5 days.

Finally, exclude all events from those cases.

So, I can break this into subqueries or CTEs.

Plan:

1. First, find all cases that have the sequence.

2. For each such case, find the sequence occurrences where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' > 5 days.

3. If a case has at least one such occurrence, mark the entire case for exclusion.

4. Then, select all events where case_id is not in the list of excluded cases.

I can do this with window functions and conditional aggregation.

Let me think about the window functions.

I can partition by case_id, order by timestamp, and then use LEAD to get the next activities.

For each row, I can set a flag if:

- current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

- LEAD(activity) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) is 'Create Order'

- LEAD(LEAD(activity), but LEAD can be nested? Actually, LEAD(activity, 2) to get two rows ahead.

In DuckDB, LEAD(activity, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) will give the activity two rows after the current one.

Similarly, I can get the timestamps.

I need to compare activities and timestamps.

Define:

Let me create a CTE or subquery to get the activity and lead activities.

For each event, I can have:

- activity

- lead1_activity = LEAD(activity) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp)

- lead2_activity = LEAD(activity, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp)

Similarly for timestamps:

- lead1_timestamp = LEAD(timestamp) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp)

- lead2_timestamp = LEAD(timestamp, 2) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp)

But LEAD(timestamp, 2) would give the timestamp two rows after, which is what I need for 'Confirm Order' if the sequence is three events in a row.

For the sequence:

If for an event E, activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and lead1_activity = 'Create Order', and lead2_activity = 'Confirm Order', then E is the start of a sequence.

Then, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp, since lead1_timestamp is 'Create Order', lead2_timestamp is 'Confirm Order'.

If I have event i with activity A, then event i+1 with activity B, event i+2 with activity C.

So for event i, lead1 is i+1, lead2 is i+2.

So if i is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', i+1 is 'Create Order', i+2 is 'Confirm Order', then the time between i+1 and i+2 is lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp.

Yes.

Now, I need to find cases where there exists at least one such event i where the condition holds and (lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp) > interval '5 days'.

But since timestamps are datetime, I can compute the difference.

Now, for each case, I need to check if there is any such sequence.

I can group by case_id and use conditional aggregation to check if any row in the case satisfies the condition.

Then, if a case has at least one such row, I can mark it for exclusion.

Finally, I can select all events where case_id is not in the set of excluded case_ids.

To avoid scanning the table twice, I might do this in a single query with subqueries.

Let me outline the query structure.

I can have a CTE that computes for each event the lead activities and timestamps.

Then, another CTE that flags cases that have the sequence with time > 5 days.

Then, select all events except those case_ids.

Since I need to return events, I should probably keep the events and join back or use a where clause.

A common way is to use a subquery to find the excluded case_ids.

Let me write the SQL step by step.

First, create a CTE to get the lead columns.

WITH lag_data AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead1_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead1_timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead2_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead2_timestamp
    FROM event_log
)

Now, from lag_data, I want to find cases that have at least one row where:

activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

AND lead1_activity = 'Create Order'

AND lead2_activity = 'Confirm Order'

AND (lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp) > interval '5 days'

I need to compute the difference. Timestamps are datetime, so subtracting gives an interval. I can compare with interval '5 days'.

But DuckDB might need explicit casting or it should work.

In SQL, datetime - datetime gives an interval, so comparing with interval should be fine.

Now, for each case, I need to check if there is any such row.

I can group by case_id and use having with max or something.

In the having clause, I can check if any row satisfies the condition.

But in group by, I need to aggregate.

I can add a column in the CTE that is a flag for the sequence, then aggregate.

Let me add a flag in the lag_data CTE.

WITH lag_data AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead1_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead1_timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead2_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead2_timestamp,
        -- Flag if this row starts the sequence
        CASE 
            WHEN activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
                 AND lead1_activity = 'Create Order' 
                 AND lead2_activity = 'Confirm Order' 
                 AND (lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp) > interval '5 days'
            THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
        END AS is_sequence_flag
    FROM event_log
)

Now, I need to find case_ids where the sum of is_sequence_flag > 0, meaning at least one sequence occurrence.

Then, exclude those case_ids.

But I need to return all events except those from excluded cases.

So, I can create a list of excluded case_ids.

I can do:

WITH lag_data AS (
    ... as above ...
),
excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM lag_data
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING MAX(is_sequence_flag) = 1  -- since flag is 0 or 1, max=1 means at least one
    -- or HAVING SUM(is_sequence_flag) > 0
)

Then, SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)

But is this correct? Let me think.

In lag_data, I'm using LEAD functions, but LEAD might not be defined for rows where there are no next rows. For example, if a case has only one event, lead1_activity would be NULL, and the CASE condition would be false because of the ANDs, since NULL AND anything is NULL, so false. Similarly for cases with fewer than three events.

So, for cases that don't have at least three events, they won't be flagged, which is correct.

Also, for cases with the sequence, only the first event of the sequence will be flagged, because for event i, if it has lead1 and lead2, but for event i+1, it would have lead1 as i+2, but activity i+1 is 'Create Order', which is not 'Approve Purchase Requisition', so the CASE condition is false for i+1. Similarly for i+2. So only the start of the sequence is flagged, which is good.

Then, by grouping by case_id and having max(flag)=1, I get the cases that have at least one such sequence.

Then, I exclude those cases.

But in the final SELECT, I'm selecting all events from cases not excluded. But the lag_data CTE is already based on event_log, so when I select from event_log, I might be duplicating the work. Since the lag_data is a CTE, it might be materialized, but DuckDB should optimize it.

To avoid scanning event_log twice, I can include the events in the CTE or use a join.

But in this approach, I'm scanning event_log once in lag_data, then scanning it again in the final SELECT. That might be inefficient for large tables.

I can use the lag_data to filter the events directly.

Another way is to left join back to the excluded cases.

But let me first see if I can avoid the second scan.

I can use a subquery in the WHERE clause.

For example:

SELECT * FROM event_log 
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id 
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead1_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead1_timestamp,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead2_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead2_timestamp
        FROM event_log
    ) AS lag_data
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND lead1_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND lead2_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp) > interval '5 days'
    GROUP BY case_id
)

But in this subquery, I'm grouping by case_id to get the distinct case_ids that have the sequence, so the NOT IN will work.

And this way, I only scan event_log once, in the subquery with window functions.

Then, the outer query scans event_log again, but it might be faster since I'm filtering on case_id, which might be indexed. But still, it's two scans.

I can make it more efficient by using a JOIN with a derived table.

But let's go with this for clarity.

I need to handle the timing condition properly.

In the subquery, I have the condition on the difference.

But in the window functions, LEAD(timestamp, 2) might be NULL if there are not enough rows, so the condition will be false when NULL.

Also, the difference might be computed only when both timestamps are not NULL.

Now, about the interval: I need to compare with interval '5 days'. But in SQL, datetime - datetime gives an interval, and I can compare to interval '5 days'. However, I need to make sure the units are correct. Since it's time difference, it should be fine.

But DuckDB might have specific functions. I think subtracting timestamps is standard.

Another thing: the timestamps might have different precision, but I think it's okay.

Now, for the order, I assumed ordering by timestamp within case_id. This should ensure that we are looking at consecutive events in time order. But what if there are multiple events with the same timestamp? Then LEAD might not give the "next" event correctly because of the order by.

In SQL, when using window functions, if there are ties in the order by, the behavior might be undefined. For example, if two events have the same timestamp, LEAD might take one arbitrarily, which might not be consecutive if there are multiple events at the same time.

In process mining, usually, events with the same timestamp might be considered concurrent, but the problem says "direct succession", so I need to ensure that there are no other events in between. If events have the same timestamp, it might be ambiguous.

The problem states: "with no other event from the same case in between them." So, if events have the same timestamp, they might be simultaneous, so there is no event "in between" if they are concurrent.

But in terms of sequence, if multiple events happen at the same time, we might consider them as not having other events in between if we order by timestamp and assume that events with the same timestamp are processed together.

However, in the context of sequence, if there are two events at the same time, and I use LEAD, it might skip one if the order is not deterministic.

To handle this, I need a way to order events that are simultaneous. But the problem doesn't specify any additional order. Typically, in process mining, we might assume that events are ordered by timestamp, and if timestamps are equal, by activity name or something, but it's not specified.

To be safe, I should include a tie-breaker in the ORDER BY clause. For example, order by timestamp, and if equal, by activity name or by an implicit order. But since the table might not have an index, I need to specify.

The event_log table might have a primary key or a sequence number. But the problem doesn't mention any other column. So, I should assume that timestamps are distinct, or I need to handle ties.

To be precise, I should add a tie-breaker. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll order by timestamp and if tie, by activity name, but activity name might not be unique, so perhaps by the row order or something. But in SQL, I can't rely on row order without an explicit order.

Perhaps I can add a column like event_id if available, but it's not mentioned. So, I'll proceed with ordering by timestamp only, and assume that timestamps are distinct, or that simultaneous events are considered consecutive if they are next in order by timestamp.

To make it robust, I can order by timestamp and then by activity, but that might not be correct if multiple activities at same time.

Another way: in process mining, sometimes we assume that events are ordered by timestamp, and ties are broken arbitrarily, but for this problem, since the sequence must be direct succession, if there are events at the same timestamp, they might not be consecutive in the strict sense, but the problem says "no other event in between", so if events are at the same time, they are not "in between" if time is the same.

I think for simplicity, I'll assume that ordering by timestamp is sufficient, and if there are ties, it might still work as long as the sequence is defined by the order.

But to avoid issues, I'll add a secondary order. Since no other column is given, I'll use the activity name as a tie-breaker, but activity name might not be unique per timestamp, so it might not be deterministic.

Perhaps I should order by timestamp and by the activity name, but it might not be perfect.

I think for this exercise, I'll assume that timestamps are distinct or that the order by timestamp is fine.

Now, back to the query.

In the subquery, I have to group by case_id to get the distinct case_ids that have the sequence. Then NOT IN.

But when I group by case_id, I don't need to select other columns because I'm only interested in case_id for exclusion.

In the subquery, I can select case_id directly after the conditions.

Let me write the query.

SELECT * FROM event_log 
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead1_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead1_timestamp,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead2_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead2_timestamp
        FROM event_log
    ) AS lag_data
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND lead1_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND lead2_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp) > interval '5 days'
    GROUP BY case_id
)

This should work.

But is the NOT IN correct? If the subquery returns no rows, NOT IN will be true for all rows, which is correct. If there are excluded cases, it will exclude them.

I need to ensure that the subquery returns a list of case_ids that have at least one sequence with time > 5 days.

In the where clause of the subquery, I have the conditions, and I group by case_id, so for each case_id that has at least one row satisfying the condition, it will be included in the subquery result.

Then NOT IN will exclude those cases.

Also, in the lag_data, I have the window functions, which are applied to each row, but when I group by case_id, I'm aggregating over the rows, so for each case, I get the case_id if any row has the flag.

Now, about the time difference: I need to make sure that lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp is computed correctly. Since lead1_timestamp is the timestamp of 'Create Order', and lead2_timestamp is 'Confirm Order', the difference is between them.

But in the condition, I have (lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp) > interval '5 days'. This should be the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.

Yes.

Now, I think this query should work.

But let me test with a small example.

Suppose I have a case with events:

case_id 1: 
activity: 'A', timestamp: 2023-01-01

activity: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', timestamp: 2023-01-02

activity: 'Create Order', timestamp: 2023-01-03

activity: 'Confirm Order', timestamp: 2023-01-10  // 7 days later

activity: 'Other', timestamp: 2023-01-11

This case has the sequence, and time between Create and Confirm is 7 days > 5, so it should be excluded.

In the lag_data, for the event with activity 'Approve Purchase Requisition', lead1_activity should be 'Create Order', lead2_activity should be 'Confirm Order', and lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp = 2023-01-10 - 2023-01-03 = 7 days, so condition true.

Then in subquery, case_id 1 is included, so in outer query, all events for case_id 1 are excluded.

Another case with time less than 5 days, e.g., timestamp for Confirm is 2023-01-06, then difference 3 days < 5, so condition false, case not excluded.

Also, cases without the sequence are not excluded.

Now, what if a case has multiple sequences? As long as one has time > 5 days, it is excluded, which is correct because the condition is "among those cases that have the sequence, further refine to only those where the time elapsed ... is more than 5 days", and then exclude those cases. So if a case has multiple sequences, and one of them has time > 5 days, it should be excluded entirely.

Yes.

Also, if a case has the sequence but the time is not more than 5 days for all sequences, then it is not excluded, which is correct.

Now, about the ordering: I ordered by timestamp only. If there are events with same timestamp, it might not be perfect, but I'll assume it's fine for this context.

To handle ties, I can add a tie-breaker. For example, if I assume there is an implicit order, but since not specified, I'll leave it as is.

In DuckDB, I can use the ROWID or something, but it's not standard. The problem doesn't mention any other column, so I'll stick with ordering by timestamp.

Now, for the final query, I need to return all events, so I use SELECT * FROM event_log.

But I have the WHERE clause to exclude cases.

I think that's it.

Let me write the query.
</think>

Here is the DuckDB SQL query that meets your requirements. It identifies cases with the specified sequence and timing condition, then excludes all events from those cases. The query uses window functions to detect the sequence and calculates the time difference between events.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead1_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead1_timestamp,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead2_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS lead2_timestamp
        FROM event_log
    ) AS lag_data
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND lead1_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND lead2_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
    GROUP BY case_id
);
```

### Explanation:
- **Window Functions**: The inner subquery uses `LEAD` to get the next and next-next activities and timestamps for each event within a case, ordered by `timestamp`. This helps identify consecutive events.
- **Sequence Check**: The `WHERE` clause in the inner subquery filters for events that start the sequence (current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', next is 'Create Order', and next-next is 'Confirm Order').
- **Timing Condition**: The time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is computed as `lead2_timestamp - lead1_timestamp`, and it is compared to 5 days.
- **Exclusion**: Cases that have at least one occurrence of the sequence with time > 5 days are grouped and used in the `NOT IN` clause to exclude all their events from the final result.
- **Efficiency**: The query scans the `event_log` table once for the window functions and again for the final selection. For large tables, indexes on `case_id` and `timestamp` may improve performance.

This query ensures that only events from cases that do **not** meet both the sequence and timing criteria are returned.
