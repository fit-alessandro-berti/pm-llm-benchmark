Here’s a Python dictionary representing a **temporal profile** for the global supply chain process, with estimated average times and standard deviations for pairs of activities that eventually follow each other. The values are based on realistic assumptions about supply chain dynamics, lead times, and variability in high-tech electronics manufacturing.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Procurement-related pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 14400),      # Supplier Selection  Order Placement: ~1 day (std: 4h)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),     # Supplier Selection  Receive Components: ~7 days (std: 1 day)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (691200, 172800),    # Supplier Selection  Quality Inspection: ~8 days (std: 2 days)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (518400, 86400),     # Order Placement  Receive Components: ~6 days (std: 1 day)

    ('OP', 'CA'): (1209600, 259200),   # Order Placement  Component Assembly: ~14 days (std: 3 days)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),      # Receive Components  Quality Inspection: ~1 day (std: 6h)

    ('CA', 'PK'): (864000, 172800),    # Component Assembly  Packaging: ~10 days (std: 2 days)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (172800, 43200),     # Product Testing  Packaging: ~2 days (std: 12h)

    # Logistics-related pairs
    ('PK', 'WS'): (43200, 10800),      # Packaging  Warehouse Storage: ~12h (std: 3h)

    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),     # Warehouse Storage  Distribution: ~3 days (std: 1 day)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (1209600, 432000),   # Distribution  After-Sales Support: ~14 days (std: 5 days)

    # Cross-phase pairs (longer delays, higher variability)
    ('SS', 'CA'): (1814400, 432000),   # Supplier Selection  Component Assembly: ~21 days (std: 5 days)
    ('SS', 'PT'): (2419200, 604800),   # Supplier Selection  Product Testing: ~28 days (std: 7 days)
    ('OP', 'PK'): (1814400, 432000),   # Order Placement  Packaging: ~21 days (std: 5 days)
    ('RC', 'PT'): (1209600, 259200),   # Receive Components  Product Testing: ~14 days (std: 3 days)

### Key Observations:
1. **Short-term pairs** (e.g., `('RC', 'QI')`, `('PT', 'PK')`):
   - Low average times (hours to days) and low standard deviations (tight control over immediate next steps).

2. **Long-term pairs** (e.g., `('SS', 'PT')`, `('OP', 'AS')`):
   - High average times (weeks) and high standard deviations (due to cumulative variability in the supply chain).

3. **Cross-phase pairs** (e.g., `('QI', 'DT')`, `('CA', 'AS')`):
   - Reflect the end-to-end process delays, with higher variability due to dependencies on multiple steps.

4. **Logistics pairs** (e.g., `('PK', 'DT')`, `('WS', 'DT')`):
   - Moderate delays with some variability (depends on distribution network efficiency).

This profile captures the **temporal complexity** of a global supply chain, where delays can compound across phases. The standard deviations are proportional to the average times, reflecting real-world uncertainty. Adjustments can be made based on specific industry benchmarks or historical data.
