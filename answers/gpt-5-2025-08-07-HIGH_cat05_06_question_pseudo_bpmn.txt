1. What specific insights from Market Research are considered actionable for R&D, and how is a closed-loop learning mechanism built so early prototypes can rapidly pivot when signals change?
2. Which criteria determine the supplier mix across Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the USA (e.g., capacity, technology roadmap, geopolitical risk, ESG), and how often is the portfolio re-optimized?
3. How does the product architecture support component interchangeability and second-sourcing (e.g., pin-compatibility, firmware abstraction), and what is the ongoing cost of preserving those options?
4. Why is assembly centralized in Malaysia, and what scenarios justify dual-sourcing or nearshoring assembly (e.g., Mexico, India) to balance resilience, cost, and lead time?
5. Where is the strategic decoupling point between procurement and final assembly, and how are safety stocks and WIP buffers sized to meet service levels without inflating working capital?
6. In a 24/7 operation, how are OEE, changeover strategy, workforce well-being, and energy management coordinated to maximize throughput while preventing quality degradation?
7. At what stages are in-line vs end-of-line tests deployed, and how do SPC metrics and first-pass yield thresholds trigger containment, design changes (ECR/ECO), or supplier corrective actions?
8. What is the decision framework for rework versus scrap, considering delay cost, warranty/brand risk, environmental impact, and regulatory constraints on waste?
9. How is the air vs ocean allocation decided and revised in real time across launch phases, given forecast error, service-level targets, carbon budgets, and total landed cost?
10. What visibility and control mechanisms (control tower, digital twins, IoT) exist across shipping, customs, and compliance, and how are sanction/tariff changes propagated to shipments already in transit?
11. When supply is constrained, who owns allocation decisions across regions and channels, and what principles (revenue, market share, fairness, strategic accounts) drive the prioritization?
12. How are channel conflicts mitigated among retailers, e-commerce, and VIP/pre-orders, and what ATP/CTP rules govern order promising to uphold SLAs without overcommitting?
13. Which end-to-end KPIs define success (e.g., OTIF, forecast accuracy, cash-to-cash, margin leakage, DOA/warranty rates, CO2e/device), and how are cross-functional trade-offs resolved when KPIs conflict?
14. How is demand sensing integrated (POS, social media, competitor launches, macro signals) to adjust supplier orders within long-lead-time and MOQ constraints, and what option/hedging strategies are used?
15. What resilience scenarios are modeled (natural disasters, port closures, pandemics, cyberattacks), and which pre-negotiated capacities, dual sources, or inventory buffers are funded to cover them?
16. How are regulatory requirements (RoHS/REACH, WEEE, battery, right-to-repair, eSIM/data privacy, export controls) embedded in design, labeling, and documentation to prevent border delays and recalls?
17. Where can postponement or late-stage customization be applied (regional firmware, chargers, packaging, SKUs) to reduce forecast risk while meeting localization and compliance needs?
18. What governance cadence (S&OP/IBP, tiered daily stand-ups, war rooms) and RACI model ensure rapid cross-functional decisions when exceptions occur, and what are the escalation triggers?
19. How is supply chain security handled end-to-end (secure boot and firmware signing, serialization/anti-counterfeit, tamper-evident packaging), and how are partners audited for compliance?
20. What circularity and sustainability levers (repairability scores, spare parts availability, take-back/refurbish programs, packaging reduction, renewable energy at plants) can be implemented without eroding time-to-market or cost targets?
