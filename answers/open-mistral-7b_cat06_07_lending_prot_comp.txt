From the provided data, it appears that both the protected and unprotected groups follow similar process variants for obtaining a loan, such as Request Appointment, Set Appointment, Hand In Credit Application, Verify Borrowers Information, Submit File to Underwriter, and Sign Loan Agreement. However, there are some notable differences between the two groups:

1. Frequency of Loan Denials: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of loan denials compared to the protected group. This suggests that the unprotected group may be less likely to be approved for loans than the protected group.
2. Longer Average Process Time: The unprotected group also has a longer average process time for loan applications compared to the protected group. This could be due to various reasons, such as more thorough credit checks, longer waiting times for appointments, or more complex loan applications.
3. Different Process Variants: The unprotected group has a process variant that involves a skipped examination, which is not present in the protected group's process variants. This could indicate that the unprotected group is less likely to undergo a full examination process compared to the protected group.
4. Different Process Variants with Lower Frequency: The protected group has several process variants with lower frequencies, such as Make Visit to Assess Collateral, Request Co-Signer on Loan, and Sign Loan Agreement. These variants may be more common for the unprotected group, which could indicate that the protected group may be less likely to require these steps.

Overall, it appears that the unprotected group faces more challenges and has less favorable outcomes when it comes to loan applications compared to the protected group. This could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in creditworthiness, income levels, or access to resources. Further analysis and investigation would be needed to fully understand the reasons behind these differences.
