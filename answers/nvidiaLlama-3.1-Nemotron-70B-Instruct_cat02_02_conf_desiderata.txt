**Task 1: Violations of Normative Rules**

* **Case 2:**
	+ **Violation 1:** Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check, violating the strict sequence and ordering rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.
	+ **Violation 2:** Finalize Documentation was performed after a Loan Decision of Rejected, directly contravening the rule that no documentation finalization should occur after a rejection.

**Task 2: Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions (Suboptimal Behavior)**

* **Case 3:**
	+ **Desideratum Failure 1:** Credit Check occurred more than 24 hours after Application Received (on the 3rd day), which is later than the recommended timeframe.
	+ **Desideratum Failure 2:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision (over 2 days later), not meeting the promptness recommendation.
	+ **Desideratum Failure 3:** No Follow-up Call was recorded before closing the case, missing the encouraged step for alignment assurance.

**Interpretations/Justifications for Observed Behaviors:**

* **Case 2 Violations:**
	+ **Possible Misinterpretation or Overload:** The team might have misinterpreted the sequence due to high workload or lack of training, leading to the premature Risk Assessment. Similarly, the finalization after rejection could stem from a procedural misunderstanding or a mistaken belief about the loan's status.
	+ **Suggested Action:** Re-training on the strict sequence and decision logic, with an emphasis on the implications of each step and decision outcome.
* **Case 3 Desiderata Failures:**
	+ **Resource Constraints or Unforeseen Delays:** The delay in Credit Check might indicate resource constraints (e.g., shortage of personnel to conduct checks promptly) or unforeseen delays not captured in the event log.
	+ **Communication Bottlenecks:** The late notification to the applicant could suggest bottlenecks in communication processes or that the decision was not promptly relayed to the notification team.
	+ **Oversight in Follow-up:** The absence of a Follow-up Call might simply be an oversight in a typically well-managed process, highlighting the need for checklist reviews in case closure procedures.
	+ **Suggested Actions:**
		- **Resource Review:** Assess resource allocation to meet recommended timeframes.
		- **Process Streamlining:** Identify and address bottlenecks in communication and decision relay.
		- **Checklist Implementation:** Incorporate the Follow-up Call into a mandatory case closure checklist.
