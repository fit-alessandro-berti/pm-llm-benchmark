To mitigate potential bias in the loan application process, we will introduce several hypothetical activities related to sensitive attributes and fairness checks:

**Hypothetical Activities:**
*   `CheckApplicantRace`: Event recording the viewing of applicant race (a sensitive attribute).
*   `Reject_Minority`: A specific instance of `FinalDecision` (or a subsequent activity) related to minority applicants.
*   `ManualReview`: An extra step or check required to ensure fairness, especially for sensitive cases.
*   `BiasMitigationCheck`: An activity specifically designed to evaluate and mitigate potential bias before a final decision.

Here is the updated DECLARE model:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # ADDITION 1: Ensure manual review exists if sensitive attributes are checked
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # ADDITION 2: Ensure a bias check exists
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # Hypothetical activity for recording sensitive attribute check
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # ADDITION 3: Coexistence for Fairness - If a minority-related rejection occurs, a manual review MUST happen.
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "ManualReview": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # ADDITION 4: Sequential Fairness - If race is checked, a BiasMitigationCheck must follow at some point.
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # ADDITION 5: Enforce that the Bias Check MUST immediately precede the Final Decision (or rejection).
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    # ADDITION 6: Prevent direct succession from checking race to rejection (avoiding immediate biased outcome)
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

## Rationale for Bias-Mitigating Constraints

The added constraints aim to enforce specific pathways and mandatory checks whenever sensitive information is involved or when an outcome suggests potential discrimination:

| Constraint Added | Type | Activity A | Activity B | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Existence** | Unary | `ManualReview`, `BiasMitigationCheck`, `CheckApplicantRace` | N/A | Ensures these critical fairness activities are available (and in the case of `ManualReview`/`BiasMitigationCheck`, that they must occur under certain conditions). |
| **Coexistence** | Binary | `Reject_Minority` | `ManualReview` | **Fairness Check Enforcement:** Requires that if a rejection is linked to a sensitive demographic (e.g., race), a `ManualReview` must be performed in the same case (trace), ensuring consistency and scrutiny for high-risk decisions. |
| **Response** | Binary | `CheckApplicantRace` | `BiasMitigationCheck` | **Bias Mitigation Requirement:** Ensures that after viewing a sensitive attribute (`CheckApplicantRace`), a dedicated `BiasMitigationCheck` must eventually occur before proceeding further, preventing an unmitigated decision. |
| **Succession** | Binary | `BiasMitigationCheck` | `FinalDecision` | **Mandatory Precursor:** Enforces that the `FinalDecision` can only be reached immediately after the `BiasMitigationCheck` has been performed, placing the fairness review directly before the critical decision point. |
| **Non-Succession** | Binary | `CheckApplicantRace` | `Reject_Minority` | **Avoid Immediate Bias:** Prevents a direct, immediate jump from observing a sensitive attribute to a negative outcome. This forces other intermediate steps (like `BiasMitigationCheck`) to take place, breaking the potential for an instant discriminatory path. |

These additions transform the process from a purely functional model into a fairness-aware model by building compliance and scrutiny directly into the process workflow using declarative constraints.
