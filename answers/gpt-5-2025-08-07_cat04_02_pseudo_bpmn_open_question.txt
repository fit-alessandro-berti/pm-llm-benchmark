Below is a lean redesign that adds automation, dynamic resourcing, and predictive routing while keeping manual touchpoints for exceptions and highrisk cases.

Redesigned pseudo-BPMN (condensed)
Start
 Task 0: Omni-channel Intake + Data Enrichment (validate, normalize, dedupe; fetch customer, contract, historical orders)
 Gateway (XOR): Auto-Classification (ML) “Standard vs Custom vs Hybrid” with confidence
    [Low confidence] Task 0a: Human Triage (clarify requirements; correct type)
 Gateway (XOR): Risk/Triage Scoring (ML + rules) “Low/Medium/High”
    Parallel Subprocess: Event-Driven Prechecks (runs as messages, not blocking)
        • Credit Check (cache-aware; reuse recent results)
        • ATP/Inventory + Tentative Reservation (with expiry/compensation)
        • Fraud/Contract Compliance
        • Lead-time Prediction (supplier/plant capacity)
    Join when required prechecks complete or timeouts reached

 [If Type = Standard]
    Task B’: Rule-based Validation (DMN)
    Gateway (XOR): Straight-Through Eligibility? (risk low, policy compliant, inventory OK)
        [Yes] Task G’: Auto-Pricing/Quotation  Auto-Approval if within thresholds
        [No] Task F’: Manager/Policy Approval (risk/amount/segment-based)
    Task D’: Predictive Delivery Date (APS with constraints + learned carrier performance)
    Task G: Generate Final Invoice

 [If Type = Custom or Hybrid]
    Subprocess: Two-Stage Feasibility
        1) Rapid Feasibility Screener (rules + componentized BOM library; suggests standardizable options)
        2) Collaborative Design Sprint (SME + customer co-configurator; runs in time-box)
            Parallel Checks: Procurement lead times, capacity simulation, compliance design rules
    Gateway (XOR): Feasible?
         [No] E2: Rejection with Alternatives/Next-best Standard Offer  End
         [Yes] E1’: Auto-prepare Custom Quotation (templated; cost/price engine)
    Gateway (XOR): Approval Needed?
         [Yes] F: Risk/Deal Desk Approval (skills-based routing; SLA timer; batched)
              [If Rejected] H: Re-evaluate (loops to Design Sprint or pricing rules)
    Task G: Generate Final Invoice

 Task I: Proactive Confirmation (ETA, tracking, portal access, self-service changes within safe window)
 Subprocess: Learning & Monitoring (capture outcomes, model drift, process mining, SLA alerts)
End

Key design changes and how they help

1) Intake and auto-triage
- Add ML classifier to predict Standard/Custom/Hybrid plus a confidence score. Low-confidence goes to a short human triage to prevent misrouting.
- Enrich data up front (customer profile, credit tier, historical configurations) to cut back-and-forth.
Impact: Fewer handoffs, faster correct routing, better first-time-right. Slight operational complexity from model lifecycle.

2) Event-driven parallel prechecks
- Convert blocking gateways into asynchronous event-driven checks via a message bus. Use timers and partial results (e.g., continue if credit is clean but inventory check is still pending, up to a timeout).
- Cache credit decisions for a policy window; short-circuit repeats. Reserve inventory tentatively with auto-release (compensation) if the deal lapses.
Impact: Reduces idle wait, enables early failure or early confirmation; improves inventory utilization. Requires idempotent services and compensation handlers.

3) Standard path: maximize straight-through processing (STP)
- DMN/rule engine for standard validation; auto-pricing and auto-approval within guardrails (amount, risk, margin).
- Predictive ETA using learned carrier/supplier performance, not just static lead times.
Impact: STP rate increases; standard requests complete in minutes instead of hours/days.

4) Custom path: two-stage feasibility and concurrent analysis
- Rapid screener rejects impossible requests early or suggests near-standard alternatives; a guided configurator lets customers co-create viable variants.
- Concurrent procurement/capacity/compliance checks during the design sprint; digital twin/simulation to detect bottlenecks.
Impact: Cuts rework and back-and-forth; improves quote accuracy and reduces cycle time for non-standard by parallelizing work.

5) Dynamic approvals
- Risk-aware, amount-aware approval thresholds; skip approval for low-risk/low-value deals.
- Skills-based routing to managers/SMEs with current load, expertise, and calendar context; SLA timers and escalation paths.
Impact: Less time in queues; high-risk items get expert attention; fewer unnecessary approvals.

6) Resource orchestration
- Central work queue with priority classes (VIP/expedite/aged items), WIP limits, and auto-reassignment if SLAs at risk.
- Real-time capacity view of SMEs; auto-book co-creation slots for predicted custom cases when intake begins.
Impact: Smoother flow under load, better SLA adherence; requires good telemetry and routing logic.

7) Communication and customer experience
- Proactive confirmations with reasoned ETAs; self-service portal for document uploads, configuration choices, and change requests within safe windows.
- Offer next-best standard alternatives when custom infeasible, maintaining a path to yes.
Impact: Higher transparency and satisfaction; fewer inbound status calls.

8) Analytics and continuous improvement
- Process mining to locate bottlenecks and tune rules; outcome data feeds back to retrain classifiers and ETA models.
- Monitor model drift and fairness; fall back to rules if model quality degrades.
Impact: Sustained performance gains; introduces MLOps responsibilities.

New/modified gateways and subprocesses
- Auto-Classification (ML) with confidence threshold and human override.
- Risk/Triage Scoring gateway controlling STP vs. approval.
- Event-based parallel prechecks with timeouts and compensation.
- Two-Stage Feasibility subprocess for custom/hybrid.
- Dynamic Approval gateway driven by policy and risk.
- Learning & Monitoring subprocess for process mining and MLOps.

Expected results (typical ranges)
- Standard requests: 40–70% cycle time reduction; STP 60–90% depending on policy.
- Custom requests: 15–30% cycle time reduction; improved quote accuracy and conversion.
- Customer satisfaction: higher due to transparency and speed; fewer rejections without alternatives.

Trade-offs and controls
- Operational complexity rises (workflow engine, rule engine, message bus, MLOps). Mitigate with clear ownership, audit trails, versioned decisions/models, canary releases, and robust fallbacks to deterministic rules or manual paths when services/models are unavailable.

This redesign prioritizes straight-through automation for the predictable majority while creating a structured, parallelized path for non-standard work, guided by predictive insights and adaptive resource allocation.
