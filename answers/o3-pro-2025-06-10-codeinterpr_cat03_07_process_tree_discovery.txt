Final process-tree structure  
(using the operator notation introduced in the prompt)

```
-> (                                                   -- main sequence
     'RA',                                             -- Receive Application
     'VF',                                             -- first Validate Form
     'AE',                                             -- Assess Eligibility
     * (                                               -- optional / repeating loop
         tau,                                          -- 1st child (A): “do nothing” – makes the loop optional
         -> (                                          -- 2nd child (B): if we stay in the loop …
              * ( 'RMI', tau ),                        --    zero, one or many “Request Missing Info”
              'VF'                                     --    … followed by a new Validate Form
            )                                          -- end inner sequence
       ),                                              -- end loop
     'AD',                                             -- Approval Decision
     'SC',                                             -- Send Confirmation
     'AC'                                              -- Archive Case
   )
```

What the tree expresses

1. The normal flow is  
   RA    VF    AE    AD    SC    AC.

2. After the first eligibility assessment, the model can enter the loop once, many times, or not at all:  
   • Each iteration produces one or more “Request Missing Info” events,  
   • then a fresh “Validate Form”,  
   • after which the loop can either be repeated or exited.

3. When the loop is left, the case proceeds to the fixed tail AD  SC  AC.

The tree therefore allows exactly the three traces observed in the example log (and any further variants with additional RMI + VF cycles), while keeping the rest of the behaviour as simple and strict as possible.
