This is a well-structured and clear prompt for a SQL query benchmark. Here's why it's good and a tiny suggestion for maximal clarity:

**Strengths of the Prompt:**

*   **Clear Goal:** "filters out any cases containing more than six events, and returns only the events from cases that have six or fewer events in total." This is unambiguous.
*   **Explicit Table Schema:** `event_log` table with `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp` provides necessary context.
*   **Example-Free (Good for Benchmarking):** It doesn't give an example input/output, which forces the model to understand the logic rather than pattern match.
*   **Emphasis on `DuckDB`:** Clearly states the target SQL dialect, though the query itself will likely be standard SQL.
*   **Explains Domain Terms:** "process instance (or 'case')" helps clarify `case_id`.
*   **Reinforces Logic:** "In other words, the query should identify the number of events per `case_id`, exclude any `case_id` where this count is greater than six, and then return the full set of events for the remaining cases." This second explanation helps confirm understanding.
*   **Considers Grouping/Filtering:** Reminds the model of key SQL concepts involved.

**Minor Suggestion for Ultra-Clarity (Optional):**

You could add a very brief statement about the expected output columns, though "returns only the events from cases..." implies all columns from the original table.

**Example of Optional Addition:**

"...and then return the full set of events (i.e., all columns: `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) for the remaining cases."

**Overall:**

This is an excellent prompt. It's challenging enough to require understanding of window functions or subqueries/CTEs, but clear enough for a capable model to understand. I'd confidently use this as a benchmark prompt.
