**Analysis of POWL Models in Relation to the Standard Hire-to-Retire Process**

### **Expected Order of Activities in a Standard Hire-to-Retire Process:**

1. Post Job Advertisement
2. Screen Candidates
3. Conduct Interviews
4. Make Hiring Decision
5. Onboard New Employee
6. Add to Payroll System
7. Close the Case

### **Analysis of POWL Model 1:**

* **Defined Order:** Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  (Make_Hiring_Decision **and** Conduct_Interviews, with no direct order between Decide and Interview)  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case
* **Identified Anomalies:**
	+ **Severity: Medium** - Conduct_Interviews and Make_Hiring_Decision are partially ordered with Screen_Candidates but have no direct order between them. Typically, interviews precede making a hiring decision.
	+ **Logical Consistency:** High - Despite the anomaly, the overall flow from posting to closing the case is logically consistent with the expected order.

### **Analysis of POWL Model 2:**

* **Defined Order:** Post_Job_Ad  (Screen_Candidates **or in parallel with** Conduct_Interviews)  Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee (in a loop, allowing repetition)  (Add_to_Payroll **exclusive or** skip)  Close_Case
* **Identified Anomalies:**
	+ **Severity: High** - Screen_Candidates and Conduct_Interviews can occur in parallel or in any order. This violates the typical sequential logic where candidates are first screened, then interviewed.
	+ **Severity: Medium** - The loop on Onboard_Employee allows for repetition, which is unusual in a standard Hire-to-Retire process where onboarding is typically a one-time activity per employee.
	+ **Severity: High** - The exclusive choice (XOR) between Add_to_Payroll and a silent transition (skip) introduces a possibility where a new employee might not be added to the payroll system, fundamentally violating the process's integrity.

### **Comparison and Justification for the More Normative Model:**

**POWL Model 1 more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process.** Here's why:

1. **Logic Integrity:** Model 1, despite having an anomaly, maintains a more logically consistent flow from the job posting to the case closure, aligning closer to the standard process.
2. **Anomaly Severity:** The anomaly in Model 1 (lack of direct order between interviews and hiring decision) is of medium severity and does not fundamentally break the process logic. In contrast, Model 2's anomalies are of high severity, significantly deviating from standard practice.
3. **Process Correctness:** Model 2's potential for parallel screening and interviewing, looped onboarding, and skipped payroll addition pose significant risks to process correctness and integrity. These deviations could lead to operational errors, legal issues, or missed critical steps in the hiring process.

**Recommendation:** To align with a normative Hire-to-Retire process, Model 1 should be further refined to establish a direct, logical order between Conduct_Interviews and Make_Hiring_Decision. Model 2 requires more substantial revisions to address its high-severity anomalies, ensuring that the process adheres to logical, sequential, and necessary steps for hiring and onboarding employees.
