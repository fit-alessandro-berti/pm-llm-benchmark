 To construct a Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process, we need to define the constraints based on the activities provided and their logical sequence. Here's a possible Log Skeleton represented as a Python dictionary:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        # No activities are equivalent; each occurs independently.
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receive Order must always occur before Check Availability.
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Check Availability must always occur before Reserve Items.
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserve Items must always occur before Pick Items.
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Pick Items must always occur before Quality Check.
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Quality Check must always occur before Pack Order.
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Pack Order must always occur before Generate Shipping Label.
        ('GSL', 'D'), # Generate Shipping Label must always occur before Dispatch.
        ('D', 'IC'),   # Dispatch must always occur before Invoice Customer.
        ('IC', 'RP'),  # Invoice Customer must always occur before Record Payment.
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Check Availability should always occur after Receive Order.
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Reserve Items should always occur after Check Availability.
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Pick Items should always occur after Reserve Items.
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Quality Check should always occur after Pick Items.
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Pack Order should always occur after Quality Check.
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Generate Shipping Label should always occur after Pack Order.
        ('GSL', 'D'), # Dispatch should always occur after Generate Shipping Label.
        ('D', 'IC'),   # Invoice Customer should always occur after Dispatch.
        ('IC', 'RP'),  # Record Payment should always occur after Invoice Customer.
    },
    'never_together': {
        # There are no activities that cannot co-exist in the same case.
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},     # Receive Order occurs exactly once.
        'CA': {1},     # Check Availability occurs exactly once.
        'RI': {1},     # Reserve Items occurs exactly once.
        'PI': {1},     # Pick Items occurs exactly once.
        'QC': {1},     # Quality Check occurs exactly once.
        'PO': {1},     # Pack Order occurs exactly once.
        'GSL': {1},    # Generate Shipping Label occurs exactly once.
        'D': {1},      # Dispatch occurs exactly once.
        'IC': {1},     # Invoice Customer occurs exactly once.
        'RP': {1},     # Record Payment occurs exactly once.
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Check Availability shall occur immediately after Receive Order.
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Reserve Items shall occur immediately after Check Availability.
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Pick Items shall occur immediately after Reserve Items.
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Quality Check shall occur immediately after Pick Items.
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Pack Order shall occur immediately after Quality Check.
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Generate Shipping Label shall occur immediately after Pack Order.
        ('GSL', 'D'), # Dispatch shall occur immediately after Generate Shipping Label.
        ('D', 'IC'),   # Invoice Customer shall occur immediately after Dispatch.
        ('IC', 'RP'),  # Record Payment shall occur immediately after Invoice Customer.
    }
}
```

In this Log Skeleton, we have defined the following constraints:

- **Equivalence**: There are no equivalent activities; each activity occurs independently.
- **Always Before**: Each activity has a successor that must always occur after it, defining a strict sequence of events.
- **Always After**: Each activity has a predecessor that must always occur before it, reinforcing the strict sequence of events.
- **Never Together**: There are no activities that cannot co-exist in the same case.
- **Activity Occurrences**: Each activity is constrained to occur exactly once in a case.
- **Directly Follows Constraints**: Defines a strict sequence where each activity is immediately followed by another specific activity.

This model assumes that every order follows the same sequence of steps without any deviation or parallel processing. If the process allows for parallel activities or has other constraints, the Log Skeleton would need to be adjusted accordingly.
