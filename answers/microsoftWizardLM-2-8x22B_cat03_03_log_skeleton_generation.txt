 Certainly! Let's consider a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process, which typically includes the following activities:

1. Purchase Requisition (PR)
2. Purchase Order (PO) Creation
3. Goods Receipt (GR)
4. Invoice Receipt (IR)
5. Invoice Approval (IA)
6. Payment (P)

Here's a hypothetical Log Skeleton model for this process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    'always_before': {('Purchase Requisition', 'Purchase Order Creation'),
                       ('Purchase Order Creation', 'Goods Receipt'),
                       ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'),
                       ('Invoice Receipt', 'Invoice Approval'),
                       ('Invoice Approval', 'Payment')},
    'always_after': {('Goods Receipt', 'Purchase Order Creation'),
                        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Goods Receipt'),
                        ('Invoice Approval', 'Invoice Receipt'),
                        ('Payment', 'Invoice Approval')},
    'never_together': {('Purchase Requisition', 'Goods Receipt'),
                          ('Purchase Requisition', 'Invoice Receipt'),
                          ('Purchase Requisition', 'Invoice Approval'),
                          ('Purchase Requisition', 'Payment'),
                          ('Goods Receipt', 'Payment')},
    'activ_freq': {'Purchase Requisition': {1},
                     'Purchase Order Creation': {1},
                     'Goods Receipt': {1},
                     'Invoice Receipt': {1},
                     'Invoice Approval': {1},
                     'Payment': {1}},
    'directly_follows': {('Purchase Requisition', 'Purchase Order Creation'),
                            ('Purchase Order Creation', 'Goods Receipt'),
                            ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'),
                            ('Invoice Receipt', 'Invoice Appro
