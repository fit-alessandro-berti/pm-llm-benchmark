Here’s a concise description of the visualization:

- It shows a process model (on the left) combined with a legend of routing constructs (on the right).
- Activities are depicted as rounded rectangles labeled:
  - a: register request
  - b: examine thoroughly
  - c: examine casually
  - d: check ticket
  - f: reinitiate request
  - e: decide
  - g: pay compensation
  - h: reject request
  - z: end
- Small black circles on edges represent control-flow “connectors” (places or routing points).
- The flow:
  - Starts at “register request” (a).
  - Branches to alternative or concurrent examination/check activities (b, c, d), then moves toward “decide” (e).
  - From “decide” (e), the process can:
    - Loop back via “reinitiate request” (f) to earlier activities, or
    - Proceed to either “pay compensation” (g) or “reject request” (h), and finally reach “end” (z).
- The lower-right gray panel is a legend illustrating different gateway patterns using the same node/circle style:
  - XOR-split / XOR-join (exclusive choice/merge)
  - AND-split / AND-join (parallel split/synchronization)
  - OR-split / OR-join (inclusive choice/merge)

Overall, it’s a Petri-net-style or workflow-net-style diagram showing a customer request handling process and the standard control-flow constructs used within it.
