**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:** An `OrderedDict` is used to maintain the standard order of DECLARE constraints, and it's initialized with all possible constraint types as keys, each mapping to an empty dictionary.
2.  **Unary Constraints:**
    *   `existence`: We assume all listed activities *must* occur for a typical, complete process trace, hence they are all included.
    *   `exactly_one`: It's logical that the final approval gate (`AG`), the final launch (`FL`), and perhaps the initial idea generation (`IG`) happen only once per product process instance.
    *   `init`: The process clearly starts with `Idea Generation (IG)`.
    *   `absence`: No activities are explicitly forbidden in the description.
3.  **Binary Constraints:**
    *   `succession`: Used for clear, sequential steps where A must precede B, and B must follow A (e.g., IG -> DD, AG -> MP, MP -> FL).
    *   `precedence`: Used when an activity (`PC`, `AG`) requires multiple prior activities (`TFC`/`CE` for `PC`; `LT`/`UT` for `AG`) to have happened *before* it, even if those prerequisites could occur in parallel or different orders relative to each other. It states: "If B happens, A must have happened before".
    *   `response`: Used to reinforce that if a prerequisite step occurs (like `DD`, `PC`, `LT`, `UT`), the subsequent necessary step *must* follow it eventually. It states: "If A happens, B must happen after". Combining `precedence` and `response` often implies `succession`, but listing them separately can sometimes be clearer, especially in complex branching/joining scenarios. Here, they emphasize the dependencies.
    *   `responded_existence`: Captures the weaker requirement that if A occurs, B must *also* occur within the trace, without strict ordering beyond existence (e.g., creating a prototype implies testing must occur).
    *   `coexistence`: Used for activities that are tightly coupled and always occur together if either one occurs (e.g., TFC and CE might be performed as a pair; LT and UT might both be mandatory if testing is done).
4.  **Other Constraints:** Constraints like `chain*` (immediate succession), `alt*` (succession but not immediate), and `non*` (negated constraints) were not explicitly suggested by the scenario description and are left empty. They could be added if more specific rules were known (e.g., "User Testing cannot *immediately* follow Lab Testing").
5.  **Support and Confidence:** As per the prompt, all defined rules are assigned a tuple `(1.0, 1.0)` representing full support and confidence.

This dictionary now represents the specified product design and launch process according to the DECLARE constraint language structure.
