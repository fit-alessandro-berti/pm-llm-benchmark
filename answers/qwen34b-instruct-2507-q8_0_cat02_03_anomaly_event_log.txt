Let's analyze the provided **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** event log case by case, focusing on **standard P2P process sequences** and identifying **anomalies** that deviate from accepted business practices.

---

###  Standard P2P Process Flow (Typical Sequence)

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  
    Initiated by a user requesting goods/services.

2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**  
    Requires approval from a manager or authority before proceeding.

3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**  
    Sent to the vendor after requisition approval.

4. **Receive Goods / Services**  
    Physical or digital receipt of delivered items.

5. **Vendor Invoice Received**  
    Invoice from the vendor is received, typically after goods are delivered.

6. **Match Invoice to PO (and Receipt)**  
    Ensure invoice matches PO and goods receipt to prevent overpayment or fraud.

7. **Release Payment**  
    Payment is authorized and released to the vendor.

8. **Close Case**  
    Final step to close the process instance.

>  **Key Principles**:
> - **Approval before PO issuance** is standard.
> - **Goods receipt must occur before invoice receipt** (or at least before matching).
> - **Invoice matching must happen after goods receipt** — otherwise, it's invalid.
> - **Payment release must occur after invoice matching**.
> - **All steps must follow a logical, chronological order**.

##  Case-by-Case Analysis

###  Case 1001 – Normal Sequence

| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 08:00 | Create PR |
| 08:15 | Approve PR |
| 09:00 | Issue PO |
| 10:00 | Receive Goods |
| 11:30 | Vendor Invoice Received |
| 05:00 | Match Invoice to PO |
| 10:00 | Release Payment |
| 15:00 | Close Case |

 **All steps follow standard sequence.**  
- PR  Approval  PO  Goods  Invoice  Match  Payment  Close  
- Goods received before invoice  valid  
- Invoice received after goods  valid  
- Matching after receipt  valid  
 **No anomaly**

---

###  Case 1002 – **Anomaly: Approval after Purchase Order Issuance**

| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 08:30 | Create PR |
| 08:40 | Issue PO  (before approval) |
| 03:00 | Vendor Invoice Received |
| 03:15 | Release Payment  (before matching) |
| 08:00 | Approve Purchase Requisition  (after PO and payment) |

 **Anomaly Detected**:

- **Purchase Order issued before requisition approval**  
   This violates standard policy. A PO should **not** be issued until the requisition is approved.  
   Risk: Unauthorized or unapproved spending.

- **Payment released before invoice matching**  
   Payment is released on **Feb 3**, while the invoice is only received on **Feb 3**, and matching occurs on **Feb 4**.  
   But even more critically: **Payment is released before matching** (on Feb 3, 07:15), while matching occurs on **Feb 5**.  
   This means payment was released **before invoice was matched**  **fraud risk**.

- **Goods receipt occurs AFTER payment release** (Feb 4)  
   Goods received on **Feb 4**, but payment released on **Feb 3**  **Invalid**  
   Goods cannot be received after payment is released — this violates process logic.

 **Why it’s problematic**:
- **Unauthorized PO issuance**  potential financial loss or fraud.
- **Payment released before invoice matching**  violates internal controls and audit requirements.
- **Goods received after payment**  suggests possible **payment before delivery**, which is a major red flag (e.g., goods not delivered, or invoice fraud).

>  This case breaks **core P2P controls** and is a **high-risk anomaly**.

---

###  Case 1003 – **Anomaly: Invoice Received AFTER Payment Release**

| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 09:00 | Create PR |
| 09:10 | Approve PR |
| 10:00 | Issue PO |
| 08:00 | Release Payment  (before goods receipt) |
| 09:00 | Vendor Invoice Received  (after payment release) |
| 10:00 | Receive Goods  (after payment) |
| 11:00 | Match Invoice to PO |
| 12:00 | Close Case |

 **Anomaly Detected**:

- **Payment released on Feb 8**, but:
  - **Goods received on Feb 10**
  - **Invoice received on Feb 9**

 So **payment released BEFORE goods receipt**  **Invalid**

 And **invoice received AFTER payment**  **No matching possible** (since invoice is received after matching)

 **Why it’s problematic**:

- **Payment issued before goods receipt**  violates the principle that **payment should only occur after delivery and invoice matching**.
- **Invoice received after payment**  makes matching impossible or invalid  **fraud risk** (e.g., vendor inflating invoice).
- This **undermines financial accuracy** and **violates audit trails**.

>  This is a **critical control failure** — **payment issued before goods receipt** is a serious deviation.

>  Note: While the invoice is received after the payment, it’s still received *after* goods receipt, which is acceptable — but **payment before goods** is not.

 **Conclusion**: **Anomalous and problematic**.

###  Case 1004 – **Seems Normal (but subtle timing issue)**

| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|---------|
| 10:00 | Create PR |
| 10:15 | Approve PR |
| 09:00 | Receive Goods  (before PO?) |
| 09:15 | Issue PO  (after goods receipt?) |
| 07:00 | Vendor Invoice Received |
| 07:30 | Match Invoice to PO |
| 07:00 | Release Payment |
| 11:00 | Close Case |

 **Critical Anomaly: Goods received BEFORE PO issuance**

- **Goods received on Feb 6 at 09:00**
- **PO issued on Feb 6 at 09:15**  only 15 minutes later

 This is **reversed logic**.

 **Standard P2P Rule**:  
> A **Purchase Order is issued to a vendor** to acquire goods.  
> Goods are **received after** the PO is issued.

 So **goods cannot be received before PO is issued** — otherwise, the vendor didn’t know what was ordered.

 **Why this is problematic**:

- **Goods received before PO**  implies **goods were delivered without a formal purchase order**  **unauthorized procurement**.
- This could indicate **fraud**, **shadow procurement**, or **vendor bypassing procurement rules**.
- It violates the **"PO as a binding agreement"** principle.

>  This is a **major process anomaly** — violates the **PO-goods sequence**.

##  Summary of Anomalies

| Case ID | Anomaly | Why Problematic |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **1002** | PO issued before requisition approval; payment released before matching | Unauthorized spending; payment before invoice matching; goods received after payment  **fraud risk** |
| **1003** | Payment released before goods receipt | Payment made before delivery  **financial risk**, audit failure |
| **1004** | Goods received before PO issuance | Goods delivered without formal order  **shadow procurement**, fraud, lack of control |

>  Case 1001: Normal, follows all P2P standards.

---

##  Final Answer:

###  Anomalous Cases and Explanations:

1. **Case 1002**:
   - **Anomaly**: Purchase Order issued before requisition approval and payment released before invoice matching.
   - **Problem**: Violates approval controls and payment matching rules. Payment was released before goods were received and before invoice matching — indicating **unauthorized spending and potential fraud**.

2. **Case 1003**:
   - **Anomaly**: Payment released before goods receipt.
   - **Problem**: Payment was made prior to receiving goods, which violates standard P2P controls. This raises **significant financial risk**, as goods may not have been delivered, and the invoice is invalid or fraudulent.

3. **Case 1004**:
   - **Anomaly**: Goods received before the purchase order was issued.
   - **Problem**: Goods were delivered without a formal PO, suggesting **unauthorized or shadow procurement**. This violates procurement policies and creates **audit and compliance risks**.

---

###  Conclusion:

These anomalies indicate **serious deviations** from standard P2P controls. They suggest **lack of process discipline**, **potential fraud**, or **inadequate monitoring**. Immediate investigation is required for Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 to:
- Verify the legitimacy of transactions,
- Assess financial exposure,
- Strengthen approval workflows,
- Implement automated process validation (e.g., sequence checks, approvals before PO, matching before payment).

>  **Recommendation**: Introduce process validation rules in the P2P system to enforce:
> - Approval before PO issuance
> - Goods receipt before invoice receipt and payment
> - Invoice matching before payment release
> - Chronological order of activities

These controls would prevent such anomalies in the future. 

--- 

 **Final Answer**:  
The anomalous cases are **1002, 1003, and 1004**.  
- **1002**: PO issued before approval; payment before matching  fraud risk  
- **1003**: Payment before goods receipt  financial risk  
- **1004**: Goods received before PO  unauthorized procurement  
These deviations violate standard P2P controls and indicate potential fraud or process mismanagement. Immediate review and process correction are recommended.
