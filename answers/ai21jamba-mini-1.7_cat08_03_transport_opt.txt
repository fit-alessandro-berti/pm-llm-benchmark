### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

#### **Preprocessing and Integration of Event Logs**

To create a cohesive event log, the first step is data integration and preprocessing. Each data source (GPS, scanner, dispatch, maintenance logs) contains unique attributes that need harmonization:

- **Timestamp Standardization:** Ensure consistent date-time formats across all datasets.
- **Entity Linking:** Establish relationships between activities. For instance, map scanner events to specific vehicle IDs and package IDs.
- **Event Type Categorization:** Define event types (e.g., "Departure," "Delivery Success") for clarity.
- **Missing Data Handling:** Address gaps in the dataset by imputing missing values using nearest-neighbor imputation or statistical methods.
- **Granularity Alignment:** Align event timestamps to ensure synchronization across systems.

Challenges:

- Data format inconsistencies (e.g., differing timestamp structures).
- Data quality issues, such as duplicate events or missing case IDs.
- Large dataset size, requiring optimization for processing efficiency.

#### **Utilizing Process Discovery Algorithms**

Process discovery algorithms, such as Heuristics Miner or Alpha Miner, will analyze the event log to generate models depicting the actual delivery process. Key outputs include:

- **Flow Discovery:** Representing delivery flows from depot departure to return.
- **Complexity Metrics:** Highlighting process inefficiencies, such as frequent loops or deadlocks.

Visualization tools (e.g., Disco or Celonis) can provide intuitive process maps for understanding deviations from planned routes.

#### **Conformance Checking**

Conformance checking compares discovered models against the planned routes from the dispatch system. Deviations to investigate include:

- **Sequence Deviations:** Divergences from the planned route order.
- **Unplanned Stops:** Activities not included in the dispatch plan, such as traffic delays or maintenance.
- **Timing Differences:** Significant differences between planned and actual activity durations.

Techniques like fuzzy conformance checking enable quantification of the mismatch severity, providing actionable insights.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

Speedy Parcels’ goals translate into the following KPIs:

1. **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of deliveries completed within the promised time window.
2. **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Measures efficiency at customer locations.
3. **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Balances driving efficiency and customer interaction.
4. **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Assesses fuel efficiency.
5. **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Percentage of operational time spent on productive tasks.
6. **Failed Delivery Rate:** Packages not delivered on the first attempt.

These KPIs can be derived using event logs:

- Calculate time differences between "Depart Customer" and "Arrive Customer" to measure service duration.
- Aggregate idle times (e.g., "Unscheduled Stop") to assess inefficiencies.
- Use GPS speed and location to estimate fuel consumption and travel times.

#### **Bottleneck Identification**

Bottleneck analysis involves identifying process stages with anomalies or high durations. Example techniques include:

- **Process Mining Heatmaps:** Visualize delays across geographic locations or time intervals.
- **Frequency Analysis:** Identify frequently delayed activities (e.g., failed deliveries).
- **Concurrency Analysis:** Pinpoint simultaneous delays across vehicles, indicating systemic issues.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

#### **Potential Root Causes**

- **Route Planning:** Static routes may not adapt to real-time conditions.
- **Traffic Patterns:** Congestion data reveals significant delays during peak hours.
- **Service Time Variability:** Failed delivery attempts and customer interaction variability.
- **Maintenance:** Frequent unscheduled stops due to vehicle wear and tear.
- **Driver Behavior:** Idle times and unscheduled stops due to inexperience or negligence.

#### **Process Mining Analyses**

- **Variant Analysis:** Compare routes with high vs. low on-time delivery rates to identify best practices.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Examine durations at customer locations to identify patterns (e.g., specific locations with repeated failed deliveries).
- **Traffic Integration:** Correlate delays with real-time traffic data to confirm external contributors.
- **Driver Metrics:** Assess performance differences, correlating with training levels or tenure.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing with Real-Time Traffic Feedback**

- **Inefficiency Targeted:** Suboptimal routing due to static plans.
- **Proposed Solution:** Implement AI-based routing algorithms that integrate real-time traffic and discovered process data.
- **Data Support:** Historical delivery data from the event log informs route optimization.
- **KPI Impact:** Improved on-time delivery rate and reduced travel time.

#### **Strategy 2: Optimized Delivery Territories and Sequence**

- **Inefficiency Targeted:** High variability in service times across zones.
- **Proposed Solution:** Redesign territories based on cluster analysis of delivery times and package volumes.
- **Data Support:** Dwell time and package frequency insights from the event log.
- **KPI Impact:** Balanced workload and reduced overtime.

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance and Resource Allocation**

- **Inefficiency Targeted:** Unscheduled maintenance causing delays.
- **Proposed Solution:** Predictive maintenance schedules using vehicle usage patterns.
- **Data Support:** Maintenance logs and timestamped breakdowns.
- **KPI Impact:** Reduced breakdown frequency and increased vehicle availability.

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

#### **Operational Constraints**

- Driver working hour regulations must be respected.
- Vehicle capacities must guide territory and route design.
- Customer time windows need to remain sacrosanct.

#### **Continuous Monitoring**

Post-implementation, dashboards could track:

- **KPIs:** On-time delivery, vehicle utilization, and average stop duration.
- **Deviation Heatmaps:** Show anomalies in routing or customer interaction.
- **Alerts:** Trigger warnings for deviations beyond acceptable thresholds.

By leveraging process mining insights, Speedy Parcels can achieve a systematic improvement in delivery efficiency, ensuring punctuality and cost-effectiveness while maintaining quality service.
