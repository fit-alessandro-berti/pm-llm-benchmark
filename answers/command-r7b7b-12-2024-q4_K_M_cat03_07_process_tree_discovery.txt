**Explanation:**

This process tree captures the main flow:

1. **Root Activity (A)**: Receive Application (RA) is the starting point.
2. **Branch A/B-VF**: After RA, there's a choice between Validate Form (VF) and Request Missing Info (RMI).
3. **Loop Branch B/C-RMI**:
    * If RMI is chosen:
        * A loop is initiated with D (Request Missing Info). This allows for repeated requests for missing information.
        * After resolving missing info, the process returns to the Validate Form activity (VF).

4. **Branch C (AE)**: After validating forms, the system moves to Assess Eligibility (AE).
5. **Approval Decision (AD)**: Once eligibility is assessed, the system proceeds to Approval Decision (AD).
6. **Confirmation and Archival**:
    * If approved (E): Move to Send Confirmation (SC) via F.
    * Finally, Archive Case (AC) completes the process.
