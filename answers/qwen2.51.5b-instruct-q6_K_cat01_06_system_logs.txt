### Explanation

The event log is structured as follows:

- **Timestamp**: The exact time when an activity occurred.
- **Case ID**: A unique identifier for each case representing the user's work session. In this example, all activities are grouped under a "Q1" case since they represent sequential steps in one task (executing an annual meeting).
- **Activity Name**: Translated low-level actions into more meaningful names based on context.
  - **Focus**: Indicates that a document or file is being opened, focused on editing, and then closed again. This implies starting work with a particular document and ending it.
  - **Typing**: Recorded when the user typed text in an application (usually while working on a document). This helps understand the content creation process within applications.
  - **Save/Close**: Noted when a file is saved or closed, indicating that the editing session for a specific task has ended.
  - **Switch**: Indicates the transition between different applications, suggesting changes in focus from one application to another. The order of switching shows logical workflow transitions.
  - **Scroll/Highlight**: Recorded when users scrolled or highlighted text within an application (e.g., focusing on key findings), showing actions taken while working with documents.

### Coherent Narrative

The event log describes a user's work session during the annual meeting. They started by opening and closing files in Microsoft Word, then proceeded to use Google Chrome for email correspondence related to the meeting details. Afterward, they used Adobe Acrobat to create a report draft and finally worked on an Excel spreadsheet for budget updates before focusing back on writing an executive summary for a document.

By following these steps, you can organize complex user activities into coherent case structures that are easily understandable through standard process mining tools.
