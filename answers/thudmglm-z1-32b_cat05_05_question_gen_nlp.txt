1. How do geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and other regions impact the supply chain’s resilience, and what alternative sourcing strategies could mitigate this risk?  
2. What are the hidden costs and operational complexities of managing suppliers across multiple continents with conflicting labor and environmental standards?  
3. How might shifts in consumer demand patterns (e.g., rapid tech innovation cycles) disrupt just-in-time inventory strategies for slower-moving markets like Latin America?  
4. What trade-offs exist between prioritizing automation for scalability in the Malaysian factory versus retaining manual labor to address factory wage disparities?  
5. How do differences in regional customs regulations (e.g., EU vs. U.S. vs. ASEAN) affect shipping timelines, and what digital tools could streamline compliance?  
6. What ethical dilemmas arise when enforcing labor standards on offshore suppliers, and how might they conflict with local economic practices in low-cost manufacturing hubs?  
7. How can predictive analytics balance overstocking risks in seasonal markets (e.g., holiday releases in North America) while avoiding excess inventory in steady-demand regions?  
8. What contingency plans exist for sudden component shortages (e.g., a Taiwan chip factory shutdown) and how would they impact production timelines vs. cost premiums?  
9. How do carbon emissions targets influence decisions between air freight’s speed and maritime shipping’s sustainability, particularly for just-in-time deliveries?  
10. What role does supplier transparency play in detecting counterfeit parts, and how might blockchain solutions improve traceability without escalating costs?  
11. How might tiered supplier relationships (e.g., exclusive partnerships with OLED screen providers) create bottlenecks during demand spikes or component innovation pivots?  
12. What regulatory risks exist if the company shifts a critical supplier from Germany to China to reduce emission transport costs, and how would this affect quality control?  
13. How do cultural and linguistic barriers between R&D teams, suppliers, and logistics partners affect product iterations or crisis communication during disruptions?  
14. What are the long-term implications of relying on a concentrated supplier base (e.g., South Korea for OLED screens) for emerging technologies like foldable screens?  
15. How could direct-to-consumer sales channels fragment distribution center coordination, and what inventory allocation strategies would optimize both retail and consumer orders?  
16. What financial risks arise if the company locks in multi-year component contracts with fixed pricing during volatile raw material markets (e.g., lithium for batteries)?  
17. How do intellectual property (IP) protections vary across manufacturing regions, and what safeguards prevent supplier espionage or duplicated designs?  
18. What impact would instituting a “supplier code of conduct” audit program have on production costs, delivery timelines, and global supplier partnerships?  
19. How might extreme weather events (e.g., typhoons in Southeast Asia, hurricanes in the U.S.) disrupt multiple links in the supply chain simultaneously, and what recovery protocols are in place?  
20. What opportunities exist to repurpose excess inventory from underperforming markets into repairs, refurbished products, or raw material recycling programs to align with circular economy goals?
