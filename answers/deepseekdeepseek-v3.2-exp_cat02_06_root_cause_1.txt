Let's analyze the event log step by step.

## **1. Total Resolution Times per Case**

We calculate the time from **Receive Ticket** to **Close Ticket** for each case.

- **Case 101**  
Receive: 2024-03-01 08:00  
Close: 2024-03-01 10:15  
Duration: **2h 15m**

- **Case 102**  
Receive: 2024-03-01 08:05  
Close: 2024-03-02 09:15  
Duration: **1 day 1h 10m** (25h 10m)

- **Case 103**  
Receive: 2024-03-01 08:10  
Close: 2024-03-01 09:30  
Duration: **1h 20m**

- **Case 104**  
Receive: 2024-03-01 08:20  
Close: 2024-03-02 08:30  
Duration: **1 day 10m** (24h 10m)

- **Case 105**  
Receive: 2024-03-01 08:25  
Close: 2024-03-03 09:30  
Duration: **2 days 1h 5m** (49h 5m)

**Significantly longer cases**:  
102 (~25h), 104 (~24h), 105 (~49h)  
Average for shorter cases (101, 103): ~1h 47m.  
Clearly, 102, 104, 105 are outliers.

## **2. Potential Root Causes of Delays**

### **A. Escalations to Level-2**
- **Case 102**: Escalated at 11:30 on 03-01, next activity (Investigate Issue by Level-2) at 14:00 same day  small delay (2.5h) but then **Investigate Issue to Resolve Ticket** is overnight (14:00  next day 09:00)  likely non-working hours delay.  
- **Case 105**: Escalated at 10:00 on 03-01, next activity (Investigate Issue by Level-2) not until 14:00 **next day** (03-02)  huge gap of ~28h.

Escalations introduce **handover delays**, especially if Level-2 team has backlog or works only business hours.

---

### **B. Long waiting times between activities**
- **Case 104**:  
  - Assign to Level-1 Agent (09:30)  Investigate Issue (13:00) = 3.5h delay.  
  - Investigate Issue (13:00)  Resolve Ticket (next day 08:00) = 19h delay (overnight).  
  This suggests the agent picked it up, started investigating afternoon, but resolution required overnight work or next-day completion.

- **Case 105**:  
  - Escalate (03-01 10:00)  Investigate by Level-2 (03-02 14:00) = 28h delay.  
  - Investigate (03-02 14:00)  Resolve (03-03 09:00) = 19h delay (overnight again).

---

### **C. Triage/Assignment delays**
Triage to assignment is generally quick (within 30m–1h) for all cases. Not a big factor here.

But **Assignment to first Investigate** varies:  
- 101: 40m  
- 102: 2h 30m (then escalated without investigation?) Actually, 102: Assign L1 at 09:00, Escalate at 11:30 without "Investigate Issue" logged — maybe they investigated but didn't log? Or immediate escalation?  
- 103: 15m  
- 104: 3h 30m (long wait)  
- 105: 10m  

Case 104’s 3.5h wait before investigation is a clear inefficiency.

---

### **D. Overnight delays**
Cases 102, 104, 105 all have **Investigate  Resolve** spanning overnight.  
This could mean:
- Issues are complex and require more than one business day.
- Resolution requires external input, next-day testing, or agent shift change with handover issues.

## **3. Insights and Recommendations**

**Root causes identified**:
1. **Escalation process** — Major delays between escalation and Level-2 starting work.
2. **Handovers between shifts** — Overnight pauses in activity.
3. **Delayed start of investigation after assignment** (Case 104).
4. Possibly **Level-1 agents escalating too quickly** without attempting investigation (Case 102: assigned at 09:00, escalated at 11:30 — maybe they could have resolved if given more time/training?).

**Recommendations**:
- **Set SLAs for escalation handover**: Level-2 should acknowledge/begin work within a short time after escalation.
- **Monitor time between Assignment and first Investigate** — if >1h, flag for review.
- **Review shift handoff procedures** to ensure work continues next morning without delay.
- **Train Level-1 agents** to handle more issue types to reduce escalations.
- **Process mining alerts** for cases with "Investigate  Resolve" time >12h to check for blockers.

**Final Answer**:

Cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer resolution times.  
Primary causes:  
- Escalation to Level-2 introduces long delays.  
- Overnight waits between investigation and resolution.  
- Delays between assignment and start of investigation in some cases.  

Recommendations focus on reducing handover time, better shift management, and enhancing Level-1 capabilities.
