Inferred cases: 3 distinct patient journeys. Grouping is driven by matching patient_age + patient_gender and consistent clinical flow across departments and timestamps.

Case A — ER patient, 45 M (insurance=private)
- Events: 1  4  7  12  15
- Flow: Register (ER)  Initial triage (ER)  X-ray (Radiology)  Doctor consultation (ER)  Discharged (ER)

Case B — ER patient, 62 F (insurance=public)
- Events: 2  5  8  10  11  14  17
- Flow: Register (ER)  Initial triage (ER)  Lab test requested (ER)  Lab completed (Laboratory)  Doctor consultation (ER)  Prescription created (ER)  Discharged (ER)

Case C — Surgery patient, 28 M (insurance=private)
- Events: 3  6  9  13  16  18
- Flow: Register (Surgery)  Doctor consultation (Surgery)  Surgery preparation (Surgery)  Surgery performed (Surgery)  Recovery room (Surgery)  Discharged (Surgery)

Event-to-case mapping by line number
- 1 A, 2 B, 3 C, 4 A, 5 B, 6 C, 7 A, 8 B, 9 C, 10 B, 11 B, 12 A, 13 C, 14 B, 15 A, 16 C, 17 B, 18 C

Rationale
- Each case has a unique age+gender combination aligning with a coherent clinical path and plausible timing across departments. Resources overlap across cases (e.g., Dr. Lee) but patient attributes and activity sequences clearly separate the cases.
