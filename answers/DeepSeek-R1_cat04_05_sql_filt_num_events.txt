Here's a DuckDB SQL query that retrieves all events from cases with six or fewer events:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Subquery (Inner Query):**
   - Groups events by `case_id`
   - Filters groups using `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to only keep cases with â‰¤6 events
2. **Main Query:**
   - Selects all columns (`*`)
   - Filters results using `WHERE case_id IN` to only include events from the qualifying cases identified in the subquery

This efficiently filters cases while preserving all original event records from the remaining cases.
