Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process described and then compare each case in the event log against it to find any violations. Let me start by summarizing the key points from the normative description.

The process starts with "Receive order". Then, the next step must be "Check inventory". After that, depending on the inventory result, the path diverges. 

If inventory is sufficient:
- The sequence should continue with "Authorize payment", then "Package items", followed by "Ship order", and finally "Close order". So the order here is strict: Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. Also, "Authorize payment" must come after Check and before Package. Similarly, Ship must be after Package and before Close. 

If inventory is insufficient:
- After "Check inventory", the next step is "Cancel order", then "Close order". So the path is Check  Cancel  Close. Importantly, after cancellation, you can't do any fulfillment steps like Package or Ship. Also, "Close" must be the last step in all cases.

Key constraints mentioned:
- "Authorize payment" must be after Check and before Package.
- "Package items" must be after Authorize and before Ship.
- "Ship order" must be after Package and cannot happen after Cancel.
- "Close order" is always the final step.

Now, I need to go through each case in the event log and see if they follow these rules.

Starting with Case 1:
Activities in order:
1. Receive
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Package items
5. Ship order
6. Close order

This seems to follow the sufficient inventory path. Check comes after Receive, then Authorize after Check, Package after Authorize, Ship after Package, and Close last. No violations here. So Case 1 is okay.

Case 2:
Activities:
1. Receive
2. Check inventory
3. Package items
4. Authorize payment
5. Ship order
6. Close order

Wait, here after Check inventory, the next activity is Package items. But according to the norm, after Check, if inventory is sufficient, you should do Authorize payment next. But here, they went straight to Package without Authorize. That's a problem. The norm says Authorize must come after Check and before Package. So Package can't happen before Authorize. So this is a violation. Also, after Authorize, they did Ship, but in the correct sequence, after Authorize should be Package, then Ship. Here, Authorize is after Package, which is wrong. So two violations here: Package before Authorize, and Ship after Authorize but without Package in between? Wait, let me retrace the order:

Check  Package (violation because Authorize should be between Check and Package). Then after Package comes Authorize? Wait no, the order is:

After Check, the next step in Case 2 is Package items at 10:00, then Authorize payment at 10:30. So the sequence is Check, then Package, then Authorize. That's a clear violation because Authorize must come before Package. So the Package is before Authorize, which is against the rules. Also, after Authorize, they go to Ship order. But according to the norm, after Authorize should come Package, then Ship. Here, after Authorize, they go directly to Ship without Packaging. That's another violation. So two issues here: Package before Authorize, and Ship before Package. Additionally, Ship is after Cancel? No, in this case, inventory was checked (we don't know the result, but since they proceeded to Package, maybe they assumed sufficient stock). But regardless, the order of steps is wrong. So Case 2 has multiple violations.

Case 3:
Activities:
1. Receive
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Cancel order
5. Ship order
6. Close order

Hmm, after Check inventory, they did Authorize payment. But if the inventory was insufficient, then after Check they should go to Cancel. But here, they did Authorize before Cancel. Wait, but how do we know if the inventory was sufficient or not? The problem says the normative process branches based on inventory check. However, the event log doesn't specify the outcome of the Check inventory step. The norm says that if inventory is sufficient, proceed with the payment steps; if not, go to Cancel. But in the event log, we don't have explicit information on whether the inventory was sufficient. So this is an ambiguity. 

The description says that the process must branch into cancellation if inventory is insufficient. So if after Check inventory, the next step is Cancel, that implies insufficient. But in Case 3, after Check, they went to Authorize payment. That suggests that the inventory was sufficient. However, then they later Cancel the order. But according to the norm, once you proceed down the sufficient path (Authorize), you shouldn't cancel. Wait, but maybe the Cancel could be a later decision? The norm says if inventory is insufficient, you cancel. But if inventory was sufficient, but maybe later they decide to cancel for another reason? The norm doesn't mention that. The norm's description says that the cancellation is only for insufficient inventory. So perhaps in the normative process, once you pass the inventory check (sufficient), you can't cancel. But in this case, after Authorize, they did Cancel. That would be a violation because after proceeding past the inventory check (sufficient), they shouldn't cancel. Alternatively, maybe the Cancel is allowed even if inventory was sufficient? The problem says "if the inventory check reveals not enough stock, the process must branch into cancellation". So the cancellation is only for insufficient inventory. If inventory was sufficient, the process should proceed to payment, etc. Therefore, in Case 3, if after Check they went to Authorize, that implies inventory was sufficient, so they shouldn't have a Cancel step later. The Cancel here is unexpected. Also, after Cancel, they did Ship order. But according to the norm, after Cancel, you go to Close, and cannot do Ship. So Ship after Cancel is a violation. Additionally, the Cancel comes after Authorize, which is not part of the normal flow. So multiple issues here: Cancel after Authorize (which is part of the sufficient path), and Ship after Cancel. So Case 3 has violations.

Case 4:
Activities:
1. Receive
2. Check inventory
3. Cancel order
4. Close order

This looks like the insufficient inventory path. Check  Cancel  Close. That's exactly what the norm says for insufficient inventory. So this is correct. No violations here.

Case 5:
Activities:
1. Receive
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Ship order
5. Close order

Wait, after Check inventory, they went to Authorize, then Ship. But according to the norm, after Authorize should come Package, then Ship. Here, they skipped Package and went straight from Authorize to Ship. So "Package items" is missing between Authorize and Ship. That's a violation because the norm requires Package after Authorize and before Ship. So Case 5 is violating because they didn't package before shipping. 

So summarizing the violations:

Case 2:
- Package items before Authorize payment (violates the order: must Authorize before Package)
- Ship order before Package items (since Ship must come after Package)
- Also, the overall sequence after Check is Package  Authorize  Ship, which is completely out of order.

Case 3:
- After Check inventory, they proceeded to Authorize payment, implying sufficient inventory, but then later did Cancel order. Since Cancel is only for insufficient inventory, this is a problem. The norm requires that if inventory is sufficient, you don't cancel. Alternatively, if the Cancel was due to another reason not covered by the norm, but the norm doesn't mention that, so it's a violation.
- Ship order after Cancel order, which is prohibited because after Cancel you should only go to Close.

Case 5:
- Ship order before Package items. The norm requires Package after Authorize and before Ship. So missing Package step between Authorize and Ship.

Case 1 and 4 are okay.

Wait, let me re-examine Case 3 again. The problem is whether the inventory was sufficient or not. The event log doesn't tell us the result of Check inventory. The norm says that the process branches based on the inventory result, but since we don't have that info, how do we interpret it? The norm says "if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock...", but in the event log, after Check, the next step is Authorize. So if the inventory was sufficient, then proceeding to Authorize is correct. But then they later do Cancel. The norm doesn't allow cancellation once you've passed the inventory check and proceeded to payment steps. So the Cancel here is unexpected. The norm's description doesn't mention any possibility of cancellation after Authorize. So this is a violation because the process went into cancellation after starting the fulfillment path. 

Alternatively, maybe the Cancel could be a separate decision, but according to the given normative process, the only time you cancel is immediately after Check if inventory is low. So any Cancel after that is not part of the norm. Therefore, Case 3's Cancel is a violation because it comes after Authorize. Also, the Ship after Cancel is another violation. 

So the violations are as I listed. Now, let me structure this properly.

### Violations in the Event Log

#### **Case 2**  
**Violations:**  
1. **Package items before Authorize payment**  
   - **Normative Expectation:** After "Check inventory," if inventory is sufficient, the next step must be "Authorize payment," followed by "Package items."  
   - **Violation:** In Case 2, "Package items" occurs at 10:00, **before** "Authorize payment" (10:30). This reverses the required sequence (Authorize  Package).  

2. **Ship order before Package items**  
   - **Normative Expectation:** "Ship order" must occur **after** "Package items."  
   - **Violation:** "Ship order" (11:00) is recorded **before** "Package items" (10:00) is completed. This skips the required "Package" step entirely.  

3. **Ship order after cancellation is not allowed**  
   - **Normative Expectation:** "Ship order" is only valid in the "sufficient inventory" path and **cannot** occur after "Cancel order."  
   - **Violation:** While Case 2 does not explicitly cancel the order, the sequence of activities (e.g., skipping "Authorize" and misordering steps) implies a failure to follow the sufficient inventory path. However, the primary issue here is the inversion of "Authorize" and "Package," which invalidates the entire fulfillment sequence.  

---

#### **Case 3**  
**Violations:**  
1. **Cancel order after Authorize payment**  
   - **Normative Expectation:** "Cancel order" should **only** occur immediately after "Check inventory" if inventory is insufficient. Once the process proceeds to "Authorize payment," it commits to the fulfillment path and **cannot** later cancel.  
   - **Violation:** After "Check inventory" (09:20), the process moves to "Authorize payment" (09:40), indicating sufficient inventory. However, it later cancels the order (10:00), which is not allowed under the normative rules.  

2. **Ship order after Cancel order**  
   - **Normative Expectation:** "Ship order" is part of the fulfillment path and **must not** occur after "Cancel order." The only valid step after "Cancel order" is "Close order."  
   - **Violation:** "Ship order" (10:30) is recorded **after** "Cancel order" (10:00), which violates the requirement that cancellation terminates the fulfillment process.  

---

#### **Case 5**  
**Violation:**  
1. **Ship order before Package items**  
   - **Normative Expectation:** "Package items" must occur **after** "Authorize payment" and **before** "Ship order."  
   - **Violation:** In Case 5, "Ship order" (11:00) is recorded **before** "Package items" is even attempted. This skips the required "Package" step entirely, violating the sequence constraints.  

---

### Summary of Non-Violating Cases  
- **Case 1** follows the correct sequence for sufficient inventory:  
  `Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close`.  
- **Case 4** follows the correct sequence for insufficient inventory:  
  `Receive  Check  Cancel  Close`.  

---

### Key Normative Rules Violated  
1. **Order of authorization and packaging:** "Authorize payment" must **precede** "Package items," which must **precede** "Ship order."  
2. **Cancellation constraints:** "Cancel order" can **only** occur immediately after "Check inventory" (for insufficient stock) and **must** be followed directly by "Close order." No fulfillment steps (e.g., "Package," "Ship") are allowed after cancellation.  
3. **Final step:** "Close order" must always be the **last** activity in all process paths.  

These violations highlight deviations from the expected logical flow, particularly in the sequencing of activities and handling of cancellation.
