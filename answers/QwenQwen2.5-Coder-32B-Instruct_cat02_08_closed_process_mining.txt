Certainly! Here are the opposite and more general concepts for each of the given concepts in the field of process mining, along with explanations:

### Automated Process Discovery
- **Opposite Concept:** Manual Process Discovery
  - **Explanation:** While Automated Process Discovery uses software and algorithms to identify processes from event data, Manual Process Discovery relies on qualitative methods and human analysis, such as interviews and observations.
- **General Concept:** Process Discovery
  - **Explanation:** Process Discovery is the broader term that encompasses both automated and manual methods of identifying and mapping business processes from data.

### Predictive Monitoring
- **Opposite Concept:** Reactive Monitoring
  - **Explanation:** Predictive Monitoring uses statistical models to foresee potential issues, whereas Reactive Monitoring reacts to events that have already occurred.
- **General Concept:** Monitoring
  - **Explanation:** Monitoring is the general practice of observing processes continuously to ensure they meet performance targets and to detect issues that may need resolution.

### Bottom-up Discovery
- **Opposite Concept:** Top-down Discovery
  - **Explanation:** Bottom-up Discovery starts with raw data and identifies patterns to form process models, while Top-down Discovery begins with high-level process definitions and refines them based on data.
- **General Concept:** Discovery
  - **Explanation:** Discovery is the general activity of identifying or uncovering processes, patterns, or underlying structures, regardless of the method.

### Process Simulation
- **Opposite Concept:** Process Execution
  - **Explanation:** Process Simulation models a process to predict behavior under different conditions, whereas Process Execution involves actually carrying out the steps in a real-world scenario.
- **General Concept:** Modeling and Execution
  - **Explanation:** Modeling and Execution are the broader concepts encompassing both the design or simulation of processes (modeling) and their real-world implementation (execution).

### Process Efficiency
- **Opposite Concept:** Process Inefficiency
  - **Explanation:** Process Efficiency refers to the optimal or high level of resource utilization in a process, in contrast to Process Inefficiency, which indicates poor or suboptimal resource utilization.
- **General Concept:** Process Performance
  - **Explanation:** Process Performance encompasses both efficiency (how well resources are utilized) and effectiveness (whether the process achieves the desired outcomes) in a broader sense.

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Opposite Concept:** Historical Monitoring
  - **Explanation:** Real-time Monitoring provides immediate feedback about the current state of a process, whereas Historical Monitoring analyzes data collected over time to assess performance trends.
- **General Concept:** Monitoring (as used above)
  - **Explanation:** Monitoring remains the broader concept, covering different time horizons and data analysis types.

These pairs and general concepts illustrate a spectrum of methodologies, approaches, and perspectives within the field of process mining.
