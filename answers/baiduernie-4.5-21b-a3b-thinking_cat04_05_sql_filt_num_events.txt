We are going to do the following steps:
 1. Count the number of events per case_id.
 2. Filter the cases to keep only those with count <= 6.
 3. Join back to the original table to get the events for the filtered cases.

 Alternatively, we can use a subquery to filter the case_ids and then join.

 Let's break it down:

 Step 1: Count events per case_id (we'll call this subquery `event_counts`).
 Step 2: Filter the `event_counts` to have counts <= 6.
 Step 3: Join the original `event_log` table with the filtered event counts to get only the events for those cases.

 We can do:

 WITH event_counts AS (
   SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as event_count
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
 )
 SELECT el.*
 FROM event_log el
 JOIN event_counts ec ON el.case_id = ec.case_id
 WHERE ec.event_count <= 6;

 However, note: the problem says "filters out any cases containing more than six events", meaning we keep cases with 6 or fewer.

 But note: the above query will include every event from every case that has <=6 events.

 Alternatively, we can use a subquery in the WHERE clause without CTE, but CTE is clearer.

 Let me write the query accordingly.

Here's the DuckDB SQL query that achieves the desired result:

```sql
WITH EventCounts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN EventCounts ec ON el.case_id = ec.case_id
WHERE ec.event_count <= 6;
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Event Counts Calculation (CTE):**
   ```sql
   WITH EventCounts AS (
       SELECT
           case_id,
           COUNT(*) AS event_count
       FROM event_log
       GROUP BY case_id
   )
   ```
   - Creates a CTE that groups events by `case_id`
   - Calculates the total number of events per each case (`event_count`)

2. **Filtering Valid Cases:**
   ```sql
   JOIN EventCounts ec ON el.case_id = ec.case_id
   WHERE ec.event_count <= 6
   ```
   - Joins the original event log with the calculated event counts
   - Filters to keep only cases where `event_count` is 6 or fewer

3. **Result:**
   - Returns all columns (`el.*`) from the original event log
   - Only includes events from cases that meet the 6 event requirement
   - Preserves all original event details and ordering

**Key Features:**
- Uses CTE for clarity and readability
- Properly handles grouping and aggregation
- Maintains original event ordering in the final result
- Efficiently filters cases before returning associated events
- Works with DuckDB's SQL dialect and optimization capabilities

This solution ensures cases with 7+ events are completely excluded, while preserving all valid events from cases with 6 or fewer events, including their original timestamp order.
