### Transformed Process Mining Event Log

The event log below is presented as a flat table, sorted by timestamp. Each row represents a transformed event suitable for import into process mining tools (e.g., CSV format with columns for Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, App, and Window). I have inferred five distinct cases based on logical units of work centered around specific documents or tasks. All original events are accounted for, with low-level actions aggregated or renamed into meaningful, higher-level activities (e.g., multiple TYPING events become "Edit Content"; SCROLL and CLICK become "Review Content" or "Compose Reply"). No events were omitted or invented.

### Explanation
I grouped events into five coherent cases (Q1: Quarterly_Report.docx editing; D1: Document1.docx drafting and updating; EM: Annual Meeting email handling; PD: Report_Draft.pdf review; BU: Budget_2024.xlsx updating) based on the primary window/document or task acted upon, using temporal context and application switches to identify logical boundaries. For instance, events directly tied to a specific window (e.g., TYPING or SAVE in Word) were assigned to that case, while SWITCH/FOCUS events initiating work were mapped to the "To" or target case as "Open" or "Resume Editing" activities. This creates analyst-friendly cases representing distinct units of user work (e.g., document editing as one process variant, email handling as another), allowing discovery of patterns like interleaving (e.g., D1 is paused for subtasks EM, PD, BU before resuming). Activity names were standardized for readability and process relevance (e.g., raw TYPING/SCROLL/CLICK became "Edit Content" or "Review Content"; SAVE became "Save Document"), focusing on the intent rather than low-level details, while preserving the original timestamp for sequencing. This results in a narrative of a multitasking session preparing report-related materials, with cases showing typical lifecycles (open  edit/review  save  close).
