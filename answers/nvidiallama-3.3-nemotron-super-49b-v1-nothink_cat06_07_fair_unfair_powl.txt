Below are the two POWL models as requested, each described with a textual explanation followed by a representative POWL model in the format inspired by the example provided (note: direct execution code isn't provided for the POWL models, as the question seems to focus on the structural representation rather than operational code. However, the structure is detailed in a way that could be translated into the `pm4py` library if needed).

### 1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

**Textual Explanation:**

- **Start**: Receive Application
- **Loop for Completeness**:
  - Data Completeness Check
  - If incomplete: Request More Info, repeat loop
- **Sequential Steps**:
  1. Skill Assessment
  2. **XOR Branch (Source of Unfairness)**:
     - **Branch A (Standard)**: Cultural Fit Check
     - **Branch B (Potential Unfairness)**: Community Affiliation Check (gives subtle advantage)
- **Final Steps (Sequential)**:
  1. Managerial Review
  2. Final Decision

**POWL Model Representation:**

```
# Define Activities
ReceiveApp = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliation = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for Data Completeness
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# XOR for Cultural Fit / Community Affiliation
FitOrAffiliation = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFit, CommunityAffiliation])

# SequentialProcess after ReceiveApp
SequentialAfterApp = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[ReceiveApp, DataLoop, SkillAssess, FitOrAffiliation, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision],
    order=[
        ReceiveApp --> DataLoop,
        DataLoop --> SkillAssess,
        SkillAssess --> FitOrAffiliation,
        FitOrAffiliation --> ManagerialReview,
        ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision
    ]
)
```

### 2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness**

**Textual Explanation:**

- **Start**: Receive Application
- **Loop for Completeness**:
  - Data Completeness Check
  - If incomplete: Request More Info, repeat loop
- **Sequential Steps (Uniform Evaluation)**:
  1. Skill Assessment
  2. **Unified Cultural Fit Evaluation (No Affiliation Bias)**
- **Final Steps (Sequential)**:
  1. Managerial Review
  2. Final Decision

**POWL Model Representation:**

```
# Define Activities (Reused from above where applicable)
ReceiveApp = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
UnifiedCulturalFit = Transition(label="UnifiedCulturalFitEvaluation")  # New, unified activity
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for Data Completeness (Same as above)
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Sequential Process without XOR Branch for Affiliation
SequentialNoBias = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[ReceiveApp, DataLoop, SkillAssess, UnifiedCulturalFit, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision],
    order=[
        ReceiveApp --> DataLoop,
        DataLoop --> SkillAssess,
        SkillAssess --> UnifiedCulturalFit,
        UnifiedCulturalFit --> ManagerialReview,
        ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision
    ]
)
```

**Key Differences Highlighting Fairness Adjustment:**

- **Removal of XOR Branch**: In the fair model, the XOR branch that allowed for differential treatment based on community affiliation is removed.
- **Introduction of UnifiedCulturalFit**: A single, unified cultural fit evaluation replaces the two-branched approach, ensuring all applicants undergo the same assessment criteria without implicit advantages.
