Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to create a BPMN-like textual model based on the interview transcripts provided. First, I need to understand each interviewee's role and their description of the invoice approval process.

Starting with Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk), she outlines the main steps: receive invoice via email, check for PO number. If missing, send back; if present, log it into the system. Then forward to Purchasing (Dan) to confirm receipt of goods. Once confirmation is received, match invoice with PO. If discrepancies exist, email Purchasing team or escalate to supervisor (Rita). After resolving issues and manager approval (Carlos), schedule payment.

Next, Dan's role as a Purchasing Officer: when he receives the invoice from AP, he checks quantities, prices, etc. If discrepancies, contact supplier or ask AP to hold. Once confirmed, send confirmation back. He mentions that if PO is missing, Mary needs to get info before proceeding. After his confirmation, it goes to manager and then payment.

Carlos (Department Manager) comes in after invoice matches PO and Dan confirms. He approves unless there are suspicious discrepancies; he might reject or ask for investigation. After approval, back to AP for payment scheduling.

Rita (AP Supervisor) handles exceptions when Mary can't resolve issues. She coordinates with suppliers or departments, creates retrospective POs if needed, then sends it back into the normal flow.

Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager) is involved in resolving discrepancies by contacting suppliers directly. She helps fix PO numbers or pricing issues but doesn’t handle approvals.

Now, need to map all these steps, roles, decision points, exceptions. Start with main path first:

1. Receive Invoice via Email
2. Check for Valid PO.
   - If no PO: Send back to supplier (Mary). Possible loop here if the supplier sends a corrected invoice. But Mary says "send it back", but Rita mentions cases where they create retrospective POs or work without one. So need two paths when PO is missing: either send back, or escalate to Rita for exceptions.

Wait, in Interview 4, Rita handles invoices with no PO by creating retrospective PO or deciding rejection. So maybe the initial check if PO is missing could have a gateway where it's sent back (Mary) OR escalated to Rita (if other reasons like informal services). Need to clarify: does Mary send back first, and only escalate when there are discrepancies after?

Looking at Mary’s account: she says if no PO, send back. But in Interview 4, Rita deals with invoices without POs but perhaps for specific cases. So maybe the standard is sending back, but sometimes they can't get a PO from supplier so Rita steps in to create one.

So possible flow after Check Valid PO (no):

- Send Back to Supplier: Then the process would loop here if supplier sends corrected invoice.
But Mary says "send it back requesting more details". So maybe that's an external message task. But since BPMN models typically show internal processes, perhaps sending back is a communication with supplier, then they resubmit.

Alternatively, Rita handles some cases where PO can't be obtained from the supplier and creates one retroactively. So there might be another path when after Mary sends it back, but if that's not resolved (supplier doesn’t send correct details), perhaps it goes to Rita?

Wait, in Interview 4: "Sometimes we have invoices that don’t match any PO because they might be for services... In those cases, I work with department heads to create a retrospective PO or decide if the invoice should be rejected."

So maybe when there's no PO and Mary sends back, sometimes supplier can't provide (maybe informal services), so Rita steps in. But how does that happen? Does Mary escalate after sending it back?

Hmm, perhaps after Send Back to Supplier, either:

- The supplier corrects and resubmits (loop back to Receive Invoice).

OR

- If the supplier doesn’t resolve, then Rita is involved (escalation path). So maybe in some cases, after multiple attempts, Mary escalates? Or does Rita come into play only when there's an unresolved discrepancy?

Looking at Rita’s interview: "I mostly come into play when there are exceptions. If Mary can’t match the invoice or if Purchasing has an issue—like the invoice is missing information or has a discrepancy that can’t be resolved—she escalates it to me."

So after trying to resolve (Mary sends back, supplier doesn't fix), perhaps she escalates to Rita.

But in this case, when there's no PO and Mary sends it back, if the supplier provides the needed details with a PO, then process proceeds. If they can’t provide, maybe Rita is involved? Or only if discrepancies arise during later steps?

Wait, need to structure these exceptions properly.

So main flow first:

- Receive Invoice
- Check for Valid PO?
  - Yes: Log into System (Mary)
    Forward to Purchasing Department (Dan) to Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services.
    Dan compares invoice with PO. If discrepancies, contact supplier or hold the invoice until corrected. Once confirmed by Dan, send confirmation back to AP.
    Then Mary matches invoice line items against PO. If match: Send to Manager for Approval (Carlos). Carlos checks and approves; if issues found, reject or investigate.
    Upon approval, schedule payment.

  - No PO: Send Back to Supplier (Mary)
      But Rita handles cases where no PO exists but can't be obtained via supplier—so after sending back, the process either loops when corrected by supplier OR escalates to Rita for alternative resolution. However, in Mary's initial step, she sends it back and perhaps if the issue isn’t resolved (supplier doesn’t provide), maybe there is a loop or escalation.

But according to Rita: "Sometimes we have invoices that don’t match any PO because they might be for services that were contracted informally. In those cases, I work with department heads to create a retrospective PO..."

So if the invoice has no PO and supplier can't provide (e.g., informal service), then it's sent to Rita.

Therefore, after "Check Valid PO" is No:

Gateway: Can Supplier Provide PO? 

- Yes: Resubmit by supplier, process continues.

7. Wait, but Mary sends back to supplier requesting details. Then the supplier might resend with a valid PO. So that would loop back to Receive Invoice step (since it's a new submission). But in BPMN terms, perhaps an intermediate event where after sending back, there's a message from supplier.

Alternatively, Rita comes into play if after initial attempt by Mary and Purchasing can't resolve the missing PO via supplier. Hmm. Let me think:

If no PO found when checking (Mary sends back to supplier), then the process would pause here until corrected. If they correct it, proceed with normal flow; else (if not resolved or invoice is for informal services without a PO), Rita steps in.

But according to Interview 4: Rita handles cases where invoices don't have POs because of informal contracts. So perhaps after sending back to supplier and if the issue isn’t fixed (no PO provided by supplier, but instead it's an actual service that was informally contracted), then Rita is involved.

Alternatively, in some cases, Mary may escalate directly to Rita even before or without involving Purchasing? Not sure.

Wait, let's map all possible paths:

Main Path:
1. Receive Invoice
2. Check Valid PO (Mary)
   - Yes: Log into System
3. Forward to Purchasing (Dan) for Confirmation of Receipt.
4. Dan compares with PO and confirms or contacts supplier if discrepancies.
5. If confirmed, Mary matches invoice line items against PO.
6. If match: Send to Manager Approval (Carlos).
7. Carlos approves or rejects.
8. Upon approval, schedule payment.

Exceptions:
- At step 2 (Check Valid PO): No
   - Send back to Supplier for correction.
      Possible loop here; the supplier either corrects and resubmits (back to Receive Invoice), OR if unable but it's a valid invoice without PO (e.g., informal service), Rita is involved.

Another exception path:
- At step 4: Dan finds discrepancies. He contacts supplier or asks AP to hold.
   - If resolved, proceed; else escalate to Rita?

Also:

At step 6, when Mary matches line items against PO and there's a discrepancy, she emails Purchasing team (Dan) for clarification. If unresolved, escalate to Rita.

So in matching step: if discrepancies exist:
Gateway: Can Discrepancy be Resolved?
   - Yes: Proceed
   - No: Escalate to Rita.

Also at Manager Approval (Carlos): if he finds issues, reject and send back for investigation (loops) or ask AP to hold.

Moreover, Karen is involved when resolving discrepancies by contacting suppliers. So in steps where Purchasing contacts supplier (Dan's part), Karen might be looped in.

So putting all together:

Main process starts with Receive Invoice (Mary). Check PO. If yes: log into system and forward to Purchasing (Dan) for confirmation of receipt. Dan confirms, then Mary matches line items. If okay, send to Carlos. Approved? Schedule payment.

But along the way there are multiple gateways where discrepancies or missing info can occur:

1. Missing PO: sent back to supplier; if resolved via supplier, proceed. Else, Rita creates retrospective PO.
2. Discrepancies in Purchasing step (Dan): contact supplier/Karen for resolution. If unresolved after some time, escalate to Rita.
3. Mary's line item matching finds discrepancies: email Dan/Purchasing team. If unresolved, escalate to Rita.
4. Manager (Carlos) rejects invoice: loop back for investigation.

Additionally, when AP escalates to Rita, she handles exceptions by coordinating with suppliers or departments and then reintegrates the invoice into main flow.

Roles involved:
- Mary (AP Clerk)
<pad> Dan (Purchasing Officer)
) Carlos (Manager)
- Rita (AP Supervisor)
= Karen (Supplier Relations)

Artifacts: PO, Invoice, confirmation emails, payment schedule.

Now need to structure this in a textual BPMN format:

Activities/Tasks:

1. Receive Invoice via Email
2. Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number
3. Log Invoice into Accounting System
4. Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department for Receipt Confirmation
5. Confirm Goods/Services Received with PO Details
6. Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System
7. Send Invoice to Manager for Approval
8. Schedule Payment

Gateways:

- After Check Valid PO: whether there's a valid PO.
- In step 5 (Dan confirming receipt): if discrepancies found, contact supplier or hold invoice.
* Also after matching line items (step 6), discrepancies?
- After manager approval (Carlos): discrepancies?

Roles:
Mary handles steps 1-3, part of 4?, steps 6, and escalation to Rita.

Dan does step 5.

Rita handles escalations when issues can't be resolved.

Artifacts: PO, invoice, confirmation emails, payment schedule.

Now structuring it:

Start with Receive Invoice (Activity) by Mary. Then Check Valid PO (Gateway). If yes, Log into System (Mary), Forward to Purchasing Department (Dan).

Purchasing Department Confirms Receipt and compares details (Dan's task). Gateway: matches or discrepancies? If matches, send confirmation back; else contact supplier (Karen involved here?), hold invoice.

Once confirmed by Dan, Mary Matches Line Items. Gateway again: match? Yes -> Manager Approval (Carlos); No -> Escalate to Rita? Or email Purchasing for clarification.

After Carlos approves, schedule payment.

If at any point discrepancies can't be resolved (e.g., after contacting supplier), escalate to Rita who then resolves and puts back into main flow.

Need to map all decision points. Also note that Rita handles exceptions where PO is missing but invoice valid via retrospective creation, or unresolved disputes.

Also consider loops: when sent back to supplier for corrections, the process restarts.

But in BPMN terms, sending back might be a message to supplier (external participant), then they resend.

However, since our model focuses on internal processes, maybe we don't detail external steps but note that invoice is resent by supplier and starts again from Receive Invoice.

Additionally, Rita handles creating retrospective PO when needed, which allows the process to continue even without initial PO.

So putting all into a structured text:

The textual BPMN would start with activities in order, gateways (decision points), roles involved at each step, artifacts used or produced, and exception paths.

Now let's lay this out:

Process Model Textual Description:

1. **Start Event**: Invoice received via email by Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).

2. **Activity 1: Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number**  
   - Role: Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk).  
   - Input: Received invoice.  
   - Output: Determined presence of valid PO.

3. **Gateway 1**: Does the invoice have a valid PO?  
   - **Yes**: Proceed to Activity 2.  
   - **No**:
      - **Send Back Invoice to Supplier** (Task) by Mary, requesting missing details. This creates an external loop; supplier may resubmit corrected invoice, restarting the process.
         - *Exception Path*: If after multiple attempts or if the PO cannot be obtained but goods/services are valid (e.g., informal agreements), escalate to Rita via **Escalate Exception** gateway.

4. **Activity 2: Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
   - Role: Mary.  
   - Input: Valid PO and invoice.  
   - Output: Logged invoice in the system.

5. **Activity 3: Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department for Receipt Confirmation**  
   - Role: Mary.  
   - Output: Notified Purchasing Officer (Dan).

6. **Activity 4: Confirm Goods/Services Received and Match PO Details**  
   - Role: Dan (Purchasing Officer).  
   - Input: Invoice, PO from system.  
   - Process:
      - Compare quantities, prices, delivery charges between invoice and PO.
         - Gateway 2: Are there discrepancies?  
            - **No**: Proceed to Activity 5.  
            - **Yes**:
               - Contact Supplier (Task) via Karen or hold the invoice for resolution. If resolved, proceed; else escalate to Rita.

7. **Activity 5: Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System**  
   - Role: Mary.  
   - Input: Confirmed receipt from Purchasing.  
   - Gateway 3: Do line items match?  
      - **Yes**: Proceed to Activity 6.  
      - **No**: 
         - Clarify with Purchasing Team (Task). If unresolved, escalate to Rita.

8. **Activity 6: Send Invoice to Department Manager for Approval**  
   - Role: Mary.  
   - Output: Notification sent to Carlos (Manager).

9. **Activity 7: Review and Approve Invoice**  
   - Role: Carlos (Department Manager).  
   - Gateway 4: Are there discrepancies or budget concerns?  
      - **No**: Proceed to Activity 8.  
      - **Yes**:
         - Reject/Investigate, looping back for clarification (possibly involving Purchasing or Rita).

10. **Activity 8: Schedule Payment**  
   - Role: Mary.  
   - Output: Invoice scheduled in payment run.

**Exception Handling via Escalation to Supervisor (Rita)**:  
- At any Gateway leading to escalation (e.g., unresolved discrepancies, missing PO without supplier resolution):  
   1. Rita intervenes to resolve the issue by contacting suppliers or creating retrospective POs.
   2. Once resolved, reintegrate into main process at appropriate stage (e.g., after obtaining valid PO via retrospective creation).

**Roles**:  
Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Manager (Carlos), Supervisor (Rita), Supplier Relations (Karen).  

**Artifacts/Data Objects**:  
@ Invoice, Purchase Order (PO), Confirmation Emails, Payment Schedule.

This seems comprehensive. Now need to check if all interviews are covered and note any ambiguities or conflicting info.

Looking back:

- In Interview 1: Mary mentions that after logging the invoice, she forwards it to Purchasing for confirmation of receipt. Dan confirms by checking against PO details. If discrepancies found (Dan's job), he contacts supplier or tells AP to hold. So Activity 4 is where Dan does his check; if issues here lead to contacting supplier.

- Rita comes into play when issues can't be resolved at any stage: missing PO after escalation, unresolved discrepancies from Purchasing/Mary, Manager rejection with need for investigation.

Karen's involvement happens during discrepancy resolution steps (Dan or Mary tasks), but she isn't part of the main flow except assisting in contact with suppliers.

- After Rita resolves an exception, process continues back to normal flow. So each time Rita fixes something, invoice is sent back into either Confirmation by Purchasing, Manager Approval, etc., depending where it was stuck.

The model should also note any loops or alternate paths due to exceptions handled by Rita or Karen.

Potential ambiguities:

- When exactly does Rita get involved? For example, if after sending back the invoice to supplier and they don't respond, how is this escalated?

Mary's initial step for no PO sends it back; but in some cases (like informal services), Rita creates a PO. So perhaps after that Send Back task, there's an implicit time-out or manual trigger where Mary escalates if unresolved.

But the interviews don’t detail whether there are multiple attempts to contact supplier before escalation. The model should note this ambiguity as "In some cases, after sending back, if no response, escalate to Rita".

Similarly for discrepancies in Purchasing step (Dan): how many times can they try contacting suppliers? Unclear from transcripts.

Thus, the textual model must mention where uncertainty exists.

### **Exception Handling**
- **Escalation to Supervisor (Rita)**:  
   1. Triggered when:
      - PO cannot be obtained after supplier follow-up (Gateway 1b).  
      - Discrepancies in Purchasing validation remain unresolved (Activity 4a).  
      - Line item mismatches persist despite clarification (Activity 5a).  
      - Manager identifies suspicious discrepancies requiring investigation (Activity 7a).

   2. *Process*: Rita coordinates with suppliers/departments to resolve issues, create retrospective POs if needed, and reintegrate the invoice into the main process.

---

### **Roles**
- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary): Checks PO, logs invoices, matches line items, schedules payments.
( Purchasing Officer (Dan): Validates receipt of goods/services and resolves discrepancies.
- Department Manager (Carlos): Approves invoices post-validation.  
- Supervisor (Rita): Handles exceptions via supplier coordination or retrospective documentation.  
E Supplier Relations (Karen): Assists in resolving supplier disputes.
