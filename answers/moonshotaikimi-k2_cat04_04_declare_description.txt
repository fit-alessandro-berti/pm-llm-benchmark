Below is a narrative-style, fully compliant walk-through of the loan approval process as dictated by the DECLARE model.  
Each mandatory constraint is explicitly called out at the point where it becomes relevant, followed by the practical interpretation, the “why-it-matters” from a business/regulatory perspective, and the probable fallout if the rule were violated.

-------------------------------------------------
1. Receive_Application  
   - **Existence & Init constraints** : the first thing that must literally appear in any trace is “Receive_Application.”  
   - From a user’s view, I fill out an online form or hand paperwork to a loan officer.  
   - **Reg Motivation**: GMT / KYC regulations require a bank to know exactly when a relationship has been initiated; regulators expect the *true* application-received timestamp.

2. Preliminary_Credit_Check (must follow Receive_Application)  
   - **Response constraint: Receive_Application  Preliminary_Credit_Check 100 % mandatory**  
   - Also **exactly_one Preliminary_Credit_Check** may appear; we are forbidden to do two, zero, or skip it.  
   - Bank runs an internal credit pull and rules-based scoring.  
   - **Risk Motivation**: if this step is missing the bank incurs “unsolicited credit risk,” a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) red-flag that regulators treat as fraud facilitation.  
   - **Failure Mode** – if we jump straight to “Authorize_Contract_Terms” we have pre-sold a loan we never vetted.

3. Gather_Additional_Documents *must* occur next  
   - **Succession: Preliminary_Credit_Check  Gather_Additional_Documents** guarantees that after scoring we immediately pivot to *evidence collection*.  
   - In real life the loan officer emails a checklist (pay-stubs, w-2s, ID).  
   - **Reg Motivation**: USA Patriot Act / AML requires documentary proof of identity and income before underwriting the exposure.

4. Quality_Assurance_Review (and with it Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package)  
   - **AltSuccession: Gather_Additional_Documents … Quality_Assurance_Review** (where “alt” means direct execution *or* hidden intermediate task).  
   - **RespondedExistence: Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package requested QoS:QAReview**  
   - The credit analyst prepares the term sheets and rate sheet *inside Assemble*, then QA validates model compliance, state usury caps, GLBA privacy disclosures.  
   - **ChainSuccession: QA-Review  Assemble-Package** (chain implies immediacy: no extra events in-between).  
   - **Motivation**: procedural integrity; without QA the bank risks an unenforceable contract or a class-action over missing truth-in-lending statements.

5. Authorize_Contract_Terms  
   - **Precedence: Quality_Assurance_Review  Authorize_Contract_Terms** (cannot authorize until QA gives sign-off).  
   - Senior manager presses “approve” in the workflow.  E-signature is served to customer for ACH authorization.  
   - **ChainPrecedence: Authorize_Contract_Terms* depends on Preliminary_Credit_Check via a *chainsuccession from QA  Assemble  Transfer*; effectively the full “chain” enforces that no signature happens until initial check + QA.

6. Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer  
   - **ChainResponse: Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Transfer_Funds** (immediate next, no intermediate).  
   - **AltResponse: Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer** (bank must inform user same day as disbursement).  
   - **NonChainSuccessionConstraint(Authorize_Contract_Terms, Notify_Customer)** forbids Notify from happening directly after Authorize; the engine must invoke an implicit “Transfer_Funds” event first.  
   - **NonCoexistence: Transfer_Funds and Receive_Application never simultaneously active in same trace** – ensures the original application object is closed and archived before money moves.  
   - Real-world: ACH wire hits account; borrower receives SMS/email “Your $25K has been deposited”.

-------------------------------------------------
Forbidden / Unwanted Paths and their Consequences
- Proceed_Without_Compliance **Absence 100 % applicable  never appears**; if any trace ever sees it the system must flag a SOX/CFPB violation and freeze the case.  
- If Preliminary_Credit_Check is skipped  we fund a fraudster or someone with a 300 FICO.
