In process mining, "process enhancement" refers to the application of various techniques to improve an existing business process, leveraging insights and data-driven recommendations derived from process mining analysis. The primary goal of process enhancement is to optimize the process, making it more efficient, effective, and aligned with organizational objectives.

To understand process enhancement, it's essential to differentiate it from two other key aspects of process mining: process discovery and conformance checking.

1. **Process Discovery**: This involves using event data to construct models that describe the actual behavior of a business process. Process discovery helps identify the as-is state of a process, revealing how it is actually executed, rather than how it is supposed to be executed according to documentation or manual descriptions.

2. **Conformance Checking**: After a process model has been created (either through process discovery or based on existing documentation), conformance checking assesses how well the actual process behavior (as reflected in event data) aligns with the process model. It identifies discrepancies, deviations, and bottlenecks in the process execution, highlighting where the actual process diverges from the intended process.

3. **Process Enhancement**: Building on the insights gained from process discovery and conformance checking, process enhancement seeks to improve the process by addressing the identified inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and deviations. It involves applying data-driven insights to redesign the process, implement changes, and monitor the impact of these enhancements. Process enhancement may focus on reducing cycle times, improving throughput, reducing costs, enhancing customer satisfaction, or achieving other business objectives.

**Key differences**:

- **Objective**: While process discovery focuses on understanding the current process, and conformance checking identifies deviations from the prescribed process, process enhancement aims to improve the process based on these insights.
- **Output**: The output of process discovery is a process model, and that of conformance checking is a diagnosis of process deviations. In contrast, the output of process enhancement is a set of actionable recommendations for process improvement and, ultimately, a more efficient and effective process.
- **Methodology**: Process discovery and conformance checking are primarily analytical activities, relying on event data and process models. Process enhancement, however, involves not only analysis but also strategic decision-making, redesign efforts, and often organizational change management.

In summary, process enhancement is about leveraging the insights from process discovery and conformance checking to make data-driven improvements to business processes. It's a proactive step towards optimizing process performance, moving beyond mere analysis to tangible action and positive change.
