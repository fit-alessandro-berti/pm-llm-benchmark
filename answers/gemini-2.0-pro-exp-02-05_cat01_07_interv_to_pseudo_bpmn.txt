Okay, here's a textual BPMN-like process model derived from the interview transcripts, consolidating the information and highlighting ambiguities where necessary:

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process

**Participants/Roles:**

*   **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):**  Handles initial invoice receipt, PO matching, and basic issue resolution.
*   **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Verifies invoice details against PO and goods/services received.
*   **Department Manager (Carlos):** Provides final approval before payment.
*   **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita):** Handles escalated exceptions and discrepancies.
*   **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):**  Assists in resolving supplier-related issues.
*   **Supplier:** (External) Provides invoices and potentially corrected invoices.
*   **Accounting System:**  Used for logging invoices, matching POs, and routing approvals.

**Process Flow (Textual BPMN-like Description):**

1.  **Start Event:** Invoice Received (Typically via email).

2.  **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary):**  `Check for PO Number`.
    *   **Input:** Invoice.
    *   **Output:** Invoice (with or without PO number).

3.  **Gateway (Exclusive):** `PO Number Present?`
    *   **Yes Path:**  Proceed to Step 4.
    *   **No Path:**
        *   **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary):** `Request PO from Supplier`.
        *   **Output:**  Request for PO.
            *   **Subsequent Flow (Uncertainty):** The interviews suggest two possibilities:
                1.  The process might *wait* for the supplier to provide the PO, then loop back to Step 2.
                2.  The Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) or Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) might intervene *immediately* to obtain the PO.  This is more likely based on Interviews 4 & 5.  This would create a parallel flow (see Exception Handling below). For now, we assume a loop back to Step 2.

4.  **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary):** `Log Invoice in Accounting System`.
    *   **Input:** Invoice with PO Number.
    *   **Output:** Logged Invoice (in the system).

5.  **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary):** `Forward Invoice to Purchasing`.
    *   **Input:** Logged Invoice.
    *   **Output:** Invoice forwarded to Purchasing.

6.  **Task (Purchasing Officer - Dan):** `Verify Invoice Against PO`.
    *   **Input:** Invoice, Purchase Order (from system).
    *   **Output:** Confirmation or Discrepancy Report.

7.  **Gateway (Exclusive):** `Invoice Matches PO?`
    *   **Yes Path:** Proceed to Step 9.
    *   **No Path:** Proceed to Step 8.

8. **Task (Purchasing Officer - Dan / Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary / Supplier Relationship Manager-Karen):** `Resolve Discrepancy`. This may involve:
    *   **Sub-Task (Purchasing Officer - Dan):** `Contact Supplier for Correction` (if supplier error).
    *   **Sub-Task (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary):** `Hold Invoice`.
    * **Sub-Task (Supplier Relationship Manager-Karen):** `Clarify Terms with Supplier`.
    *   **Output:** Corrected Invoice OR Clarification of Discrepancy.
    * **Subsequent Flow (Uncertainty):** The interviews suggest a return to Step 6.

9.  **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary):** `Match Invoice Line Items to PO`.
    * **Input:** Confirmed Invoice, PO
    * **Output:** Matched Invoice

10. **Gateway (Exclusive):** `Invoice Matches PO Line Items?`
     * **Yes Path:** Proceed to Step 12.
     * **No Path:** Proceed to Step 11.

11. **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary / Supplier Relationship Manager-Karen):** `Resolve Discrepancy`. This may involve:
    *   **Sub-Task (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary):** `Contact Purchasing for Clarification` (if supplier error).
    *   **Sub-Task (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary):** `Hold Invoice`.
    * **Sub-Task (Supplier Relationship Manager-Karen):** `Clarify Terms with Supplier`.
    *   **Output:** Corrected Invoice OR Clarification of Discrepancy.
    * **Subsequent Flow (Uncertainty):** The interviews suggest a return to Step 9.

12. **Task (System):** `Send Approval Request to Department Manager`.
    *   **Input:** Matched Invoice.
    *   **Output:** Approval Request (email notification).

13. **Task (Department Manager - Carlos):** `Review and Approve Invoice`.
    *   **Input:** Approval Request, Invoice Details, PO Details.
    *   **Output:** Approval or Rejection.

14. **Gateway (Exclusive):** `Invoice Approved?`
    *   **Yes Path:** Proceed to Step 15.
    *   **No Path:**
        *   **Task (Department Manager - Carlos):** `Reject Invoice or Request Investigation`.
        * **Subsequent Flow:** The interviews suggest that this usually results in Mary investigating and potentially escalating to Rita (see Exception Handling).  This could loop back to Step 6 or, less likely, involve creating a retrospective PO.

15. **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary):** `Schedule Invoice for Payment`.
    *   **Input:** Approved Invoice.
    *   **Output:** Scheduled Payment.

16. **End Event:** Invoice Scheduled for Payment.

**Exception Handling (Parallel Flows & Escalations):**

*   **Missing PO (Handled by Rita/Karen):** If the initial PO check fails and the supplier doesn't quickly respond, a parallel flow likely begins:
    *   **Task (Accounts Payable Supervisor - Rita):** `Investigate Missing PO`.
    *   **Task (Supplier Relationship Manager - Karen):** `Contact Supplier for PO`.
    *   **Possible Sub-Tasks (Rita):**  `Coordinate with Departments`, `Create Retrospective PO` (if applicable), or `Reject Invoice`.
    *   **Output:**  PO Number OR Decision to Reject.  This flow merges back into the main process at Step 2 (if PO is obtained) or terminates (if rejected).

*   **Invoice Discrepancies (Escalated to Rita):** If Mary cannot resolve discrepancies after contacting Purchasing or the Supplier, a parallel flow begins:
    *   **Task (Accounts Payable Supervisor - Rita):** `Investigate Discrepancy`.
    *   **Possible Sub-Tasks (Rita):** `Contact Supplier`, `Coordinate with Departments`.
    *   **Output:** Resolved Discrepancy OR Decision to Reject. This flow merges back into the main process at Step 6 (if resolved) or terminates (if rejected).

**Key Uncertainties/Notes:**

*   The exact sequence of steps when a PO is missing is unclear.  The model prioritizes immediate escalation to Rita/Karen based on their stated roles.
*   The handling of rejected invoices (by Carlos) is not fully detailed. The model assumes a loop back for investigation, but a separate rejection process might exist.
*   The model assumes a relatively linear flow, but in reality, there may be more parallel activities (e.g., Dan and Karen contacting the supplier simultaneously).
*   The degree to which the "Accounting System" automates certain tasks (e.g., PO matching) is inferred but not explicitly stated in all cases.

This textual description provides a comprehensive model based on the interviews, capturing the main flow, decision points, roles, and exception handling. It highlights areas where the interviews provide less detail, allowing for informed discussion and further refinement during the process mining study. This description is readily translatable into a visual BPMN diagram.
