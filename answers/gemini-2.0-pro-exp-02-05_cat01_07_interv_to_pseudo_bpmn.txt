Okay, here is a BPMN-like textual process model derived from the provided interview transcripts for the Invoice Approval Process.

---

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process

**Overall Goal:** To verify, approve, and schedule supplier invoices for payment based on valid purchase orders and confirmation of goods/services received.

**Pools/Participants:**

*   **Accounts Payable (AP):** Primarily the AP Clerk (Mary), with escalation to the AP Supervisor (Rita).
*   **Purchasing:** Purchasing Officer (Dan).
*   **Department Management:** Department Manager (Carlos).
*   **Supplier Relationship Management:** Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) - involved in exception handling.
*   **System:** Accounting/Workflow System.
*   **Supplier:** External entity providing invoices.

**Main Sequence Flow:**

1.  **Start Event:** `Invoice Received`
    *   **Trigger:** Supplier sends an invoice, typically via email.
    *   **Participant:** AP Clerk (Mary) initially receives it.

2.  **Task:** `Check for Purchase Order (PO)`
    *   **Participant:** AP Clerk (Mary).
    *   **Description:** Verify if the received invoice contains a valid PO number.
    *   **Input:** Invoice.

3.  **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `PO Provided?`
    *   **Condition:** Based on the outcome of `Check for Purchase Order (PO)`.

    *   **Path 1: No PO**
        *   **Task:** `Request PO/Details from Supplier`
            *   **Participant:** AP Clerk (Mary).
            *   **Description:** Send the invoice back to the supplier requesting the PO number or necessary details.
            *   **Note:** This path might terminate the current instance or loop back to `Start Event: Invoice Received` if the supplier resends. Rita (AP Supervisor) mentions handling invoices without POs (e.g., retrospective PO creation), suggesting an alternate exception path might exist here, potentially involving escalation. Karen (Supplier Relationship Mgr) might also be involved in contacting the supplier.
        *   **End Event:** `Invoice Rejected (Missing PO)` (or leads to Exception Handling)

    *   **Path 2: Yes PO**
        *   **Task:** `Log Invoice in System`
            *   **Participant:** AP Clerk (Mary).
            *   **System:** Accounting System.
            *   **Description:** Enter the basic invoice details linked to the PO into the accounting system.
            *   **Input:** Invoice, PO Number.
            *   **Output:** Logged Invoice Record.

        *   **Task:** `Forward Invoice for Receipt Confirmation`
            *   **Participant:** AP Clerk (Mary).
            *   **Recipient:** Purchasing Officer (Dan).
            *   **Description:** Send the logged invoice (or notification) to the Purchasing department.
            *   **Input:** Logged Invoice Record / Notification.

        *   **Task:** `Check Goods/Services Received & PO Alignment`
            *   **Participant:** Purchasing Officer (Dan).
            *   **Description:** Verify if goods/services were received and if invoice details (quantities, prices, charges) match the referenced PO.
            *   **Input:** Invoice details, PO details.

        *   **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `Receipt Confirmed & Details Match PO (Purchasing)?`
            *   **Condition:** Based on the outcome of `Check Goods/Services Received & PO Alignment`.

            *   **Path 1: Discrepancy Found (Purchasing)**
                *   **Task:** `Notify AP of Discrepancy` (Or potentially `Contact Supplier Directly` - Dan mentions both options)
                    *   **Participant:** Purchasing Officer (Dan).
                    *   **Recipient:** AP Clerk (Mary) / Supplier.
                    *   **Description:** Inform AP or the supplier about the mismatch (e.g., wrong quantity, price). This triggers an exception handling sub-process.

                    *   **Description:** Perform a final match of invoice line items against the PO within the system after receiving confirmation from Purchasing. (Note: Some overlap with Dan's check, potentially a system-enforced step).
                    *   **Input:** Invoice Record, PO Record, Confirmation from Purchasing.

                *   **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `System Match Successful?`
                    *   **Condition:** Based on the outcome of `Match Invoice Lines to PO in System`.

                    *   **Path 1: Discrepancy Found (AP System Match)**
                        *   **Task:** `Clarify Discrepancy with Purchasing/Supplier`

        *   **Path 1: Yes**
            *   **(Return Flow):** Loop back to the point *before* the gateway that triggered the exception (e.g., back to `Check Goods/Services Received` if triggered by Purchasing, or back to `Match Invoice Lines to PO` if triggered by AP). Requires updating invoice/PO data if necessary.
