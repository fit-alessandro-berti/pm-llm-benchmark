After analyzing the provided process variants for the protected and unprotected groups, I have identified several main differences based on my domain knowledge. Here are some key differences:

1. **Screening Process**: The protected group has more process variants that include "Extensive Screening" (14 variants) compared to the unprotected group (7 variants). This suggests that the protected group may be subject to more rigorous screening processes, which could be unfair.

2. **Rejection Rates**: The protected group has a higher number of process variants that result in "Reject Prospective Tenant" (4 variants) compared to the unprotected group (3 variants). This could indicate that the protected group is more likely to be rejected, which may be unfair.

3. **Contract Signing and Move-in**: The protected group has fewer process variants that involve signing a contract and moving in (7 variants) compared to the unprotected group (13 variants). This could suggest that the protected group is less likely to successfully rent a property.

4. **Tenant Cancellation**: Both groups have a significant number of process variants that involve "Tenant Cancels Appartment". However, the protected group has more variants that involve multiple "Pay Rent" activities before cancellation, suggesting that the protected group may be more likely to pay rent multiple times before canceling the apartment.

5. **Frequency and Performance**: The unprotected group has higher frequencies and performance values for most process variants, indicating that they may be processed more efficiently or have a higher volume of applications.

6. **Path Variability**: The protected group has more variability in their process paths, with more unique variants (24) compared to the unprotected group (21). This could suggest that the protected group is subject to more inconsistent or unpredictable treatment.

These differences suggest potential unfair treatment of the protected group, including more rigorous screening, higher rejection rates, and less successful contract signing and move-in processes. However, it's essential to note that these findings are based on domain knowledge and may require further investigation to confirm the existence of unfair biases.
