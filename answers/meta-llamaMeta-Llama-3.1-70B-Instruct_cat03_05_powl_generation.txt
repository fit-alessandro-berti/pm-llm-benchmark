Here is an example of Python code that implements a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using pm4py:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
create_purchase_order = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
approve_purchase_order = Transition(label="Approve Purchase Order")
send_purchase_order = Transition(label="Send Purchase Order")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
inspect_goods = Transition(label="Inspect Goods")
create_invoice = Transition(label="Create Invoice")
approve_invoice = Transition(label="Approve Invoice")
pay_invoice = Transition(label="Pay Invoice")

# Define silent transitions
silent_transition = SilentTransition()

# Define choice between approve or reject purchase order
approve_or_reject_purchase_order = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[approve_purchase_order, silent_transition])

# Define loop between inspect goods and receive goods
inspect_receive_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[inspect_goods, receive_goods])

# Define partial order for purchase order flow
purchase_order_flow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[create_purchase_order, approve_or_reject_purchase_order, send_purchase_order])
purchase_order_flow.order.add_edge(create_purchase_order, approve_or_reject_purchase_order)
purchase_order_flow.order.add_edge(approve_or_reject_purchase_order, send_purchase_order)

# Define partial order for goods receipt and inspection flow
goods_receipt_inspection_flow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_goods, inspect_receive_loop])
goods_receipt_inspection_flow.order.add_edge(receive_goods, inspect_receive_loop)

# Define partial order for invoice flow
invoice_flow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[create_invoice, approve_invoice, pay_invoice])
invoice_flow.order.add_edge(create_invoice, approve_invoice)
invoice_flow.order.add_edge(approve_invoice, pay_invoice)

# Define root partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[purchase_order_flow, goods_receipt_inspection_flow, invoice_flow])
root.order.add_edge(purchase_order_flow, goods_receipt_inspection_flow)
root.order.add_edge(goods_receipt_inspection_flow, invoice_flow)

# Print the POWL model
print(root)
```
This code defines a POWL model for a Purchase-to-Pay process with the following activities:

1. Create Purchase Order
2. Approve Purchase Order (with a choice to approve or reject)
3. Send Purchase Order
4. Receive Goods
5. Inspect Goods (with a loop to repeat inspection until goods are acceptable)
6. Create Invoice
7. Approve Invoice
8. Pay Invoice

The model is structured into three partial orders:

1. Purchase Order Flow: create purchase order -> approve or reject purchase order -> send purchase order
2. Goods Receipt and Inspection Flow: receive goods -> inspect goods (loop)
3. Invoice Flow: create invoice -> approve invoice -> pay invoice

The root partial order connects the three flows in the correct order.

Note that this is just one possible way to model a Purchase-to-Pay process, and the actual process may vary depending on the organization and specific requirements.
