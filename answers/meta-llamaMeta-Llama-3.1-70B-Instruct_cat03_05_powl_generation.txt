Based on the provided POWL model definition, here is an example of Python code that implements a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using pm4py:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
request_quote = Transition(label="Request Quote")
receive_quote = Transition(label="Receive Quote")
create_po = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
send_po = Transition(label="Send Purchase Order")
receive_invoice = Transition(label="Receive Invoice")
pay_invoice = Transition(label="Pay Invoice")
verify_payment = Transition(label="Verify Payment")
close_po = Transition(label="Close Purchase Order")

# Define choice and loop structures
achoices = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[create_po, send_po])
 pagamento_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[receive_invoice, pay_invoice])

# Define partial order
purchase_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    request_quote,
    receive_quote,
    achoices,
    pagamento_loop,
    verify_payment,
    close_po
])
purchase_po.order.add_edge(request_quote, receive_quote)
purchase_po.order.add_edge(receive_quote, achoices)
purchase_po.order.add_edge(achoices, pagamento_loop)
purchase_po.order.add_edge(pagamento_loop, verify_payment)
purchase_po.order.add_edge(verify_payment, close_po)

# Define additional edges for concurrency
purchase_po.order.add_edge(request_quote, pagamento_loop)  # Request Quote can be executed concurrently with Pagamento Loop
purchase_po.order.add_edge(receive_quote, pagamento_loop)  # Receive Quote can be executed concurrently with Pagamento Loop

# Create the POWL model
p2p_model = purchase_po
```
This code defines a POWL model for a Purchase-to-Pay process, where:

1. The process starts with a "Request Quote" activity.
2. After receiving a quote, two activities can be executed: "Create Purchase Order" and "Send Purchase Order". These are modeled as an exclusive choice using `OperatorPOWL`.
3. The "Pagamento Loop" is a loop between receiving an invoice and paying it. This loop continues until the payment is verified.
4. After the pagamento loop, the "Verify Payment" activity is executed.
5. Finally, the "Close Purchase Order" activity is executed.
6. Some activities are allowed to be executed concurrently, as indicated
