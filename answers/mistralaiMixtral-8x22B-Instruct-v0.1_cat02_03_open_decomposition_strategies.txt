 Decomposition strategies are often used in large-scale process mining projects to handle the complexity and size of event logs. Here are the main benefits and challenges:

Benefits:
1. Handling Large Datasets: Large-scale process mining can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Decomposition strategies help manage and analyze large datasets by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable chunks.

2. Improved Speed and Efficiency: By decomposing the event log, you can parallelize the computation, leading to faster analysis times.

3. Better Understanding of the Process: Decomposing the process into smaller parts can provide a more detailed and granular understanding of the overall process. It can reveal bottlenecks and inefficiencies that might be overlooked in a large-scale analysis.

4. Flexibility and Customization: Decomposition strategies can be customized based on the specific needs of the project. For instance, you can decompose the processes based on time intervals, business units, or specific activities.

Challenges:
1. Aggregation of Results: After analyzing the decomposed parts, aggregating the results back to give a holistic view of the process can be challenging. Care must be taken to ensure that the aggregated results accurately reflect the overall process.

2. Data Preprocessing: Decomposition strategies often require significant data preprocessing, which can be complex and time-consuming. For example, if you decompose by time intervals, you need to ensure that no cases span multiple intervals.

3. Maintaining Context: When decomposing data, you risk losing the overall context of the process. It's important to ensure that the decomposed parts still reflect the overall process.

4. Data Quality: If the quality of the event logs is poor, decomposition strategies may not provide accurate results. Large gaps in the data or noisy/incomplete event logs can significantly impact the outcome.

5. Choosing the Right Decomposition Strategy: There are various decomposition strategies (e.g., by time, by case, by task, etc.) and choosing the right one for your project can be challenging. It depends on the specific context, the characteristics of the process, and the goals of the analysis.
