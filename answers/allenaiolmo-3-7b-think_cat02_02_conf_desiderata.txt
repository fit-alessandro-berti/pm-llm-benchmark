Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the requirements clearly. The user provided a loan application process with strict rules and some recommended best practices (desiderata). They want me to analyze three cases based on these rules and identify which ones are violating the normative constraints and which are just not meeting the desiderata.

Starting with Part 1: Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules). The key here is that the process must follow the exact sequence and order without skipping steps or reversing them. Let me go through each case one by one.

Case 1:
Looking at Case 1's timeline:
- Application received at 09:00.
- Credit Check at 09:30 (immediately after, so that's good).
- Risk Assessment at 10:00 (right after credit check, so that's correct).
- Loan Decision Approved at 11:00 (after risk assessment, so that's okay).
- Then Inform Applicant at 13:00 (after decision, correct).
- Then Finalize Documentation at 13:30 (since approved, this must come before closing).
- Close Case at 14:00. That's all in order. No skips, correct order. The Finalize Documentation is before closing, which is required for approved loans. So this case is compliant with the normative rules. It doesn't violate anything. 

Case 2:
Case 2's timeline:
- Application received at 08:00.
- Then Risk Assessment at 08:20. Wait a second, that's before the Credit Check! The normative rule says Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Here, they did Risk Assessment first. That's a direct violation of the ordering rule. Then they did Credit Check at 09:00, which is after the Risk Assessment. That's not allowed. So the sequence here is messed up. The Credit Check can't be after the Risk Assessment. So this case is violating the normative rules because the Credit Check was done after the Risk Assessment step, which is not allowed. 

Additionally, after the Loan Decision (rejected at 09:30), they proceeded to Finalize Documentation at 10:00. But the rule says if rejected, you cannot finalize documentation before closing. They closed the case at 10:30, but they did finalize documentation after the rejection. That's another violation. So two normative violations here: incorrect order of Credit Check and Risk Assessment, and finalizing documentation after rejection.

Case 3:
Case 3's timeline:
- Application received at 09:00.
- Then Credit Check at 14:00? Wait, no. Wait the timestamps: looking back, the Credit Check for Case 3 is listed as 2024-01-14 10:00. Wait, the Application Received was on 2024-01-12 09:00. Then the next activity is Credit Check on 2024-01-14 10:00. That's two days later. The normative rules don't specify a time limit for Credit Check, only that it must come before Risk Assessment. But the desiderata recommend doing it within 24 hours. However, the desiderata aren't strict rules. So the Credit Check is late, but according to the strict rules, as long as it's before Risk Assessment, it's okay. Let's check the sequence here:

The Application Received is first. Then the next activity is Credit Check on the 14th, but before that, there's a gap. But the Risk Assessment is at 11:00 on the same day (2024-01-14 11:00). So Credit Check (10:00) comes before Risk Assessment (11:00), so the order is correct here. The Credit Check was delayed but the sequence is maintained. 

However, the Risk Assessment is on the same day as the Credit Check, so that's okay. Then Loan Decision is approved at 12:00. Then Inform Applicant is at 16:15? Wait no, looking again: the next activity after Loan Decision (12:00) is Inform Applicant at 15:00 on the 16th? Wait the dates might be a bit confusing here. Let me parse the timestamps properly.

Wait the Application Received was on 2024-01-12 09:00. Then the Credit Check is on 2024-01-14 10:00. The Risk Assessment is on the same day (2024-01-14 11:00). Then Loan Decision at 12:00 (same day). Then the next activity is Inform Applicant on 2024-01-16 15:00. Wait, that's two days after the Loan Decision. The desiderata recommend informing within 48 hours, so 48 hours after decision (which was on Jan 14) would be by Jan 16 15:00? Let's see: 48 hours from Jan 14 12:00 would be Jan 16 12:00, so 15:00 is 3 hours late. That's within the 48-hour window? Hmm, maybe the exact timing is a bit off, but the key point here is that the Inform Applicant is after the Loan Decision, which it is. The problem is that it's delayed beyond the recommended 48 hours, but that's a desideratum violation, not a normative one.

The Finalize Documentation is at 17:00 (2024-01-17 09:00?), wait no. Wait the Finalize Documentation is listed as 2024-01-17 09:00? Wait no, looking again at the table for Case 3:

Wait the entries for Case 3:

- 2024-01-12 09:00: Application Received  
- Then the next entry is Credit Check on 2024-01-14 10:00. So there's a gap here, but the Credit Check is before Risk Assessment (which is on 14th 11:00). So sequence is okay.  
- Loan Decision (Approved) at 2024-01-14 12:00.  
- Then the next activity is Inform Applicant at 2024-01-16 15:00. Wait that's two days after the decision. The desideratum says inform within 48 hours. 48 hours after the decision (Jan 14 12:00) would end on Jan 16 12:00. So 15:00 is 3 hours after the deadline, so it's late. But that's a desideratum issue, not a normative violation.  
- Then Finalize Documentation is at 2024-01-17 09:00? Wait no, looking at the table again: the Finalize Documentation is listed as 2024-01-17 09:00? Wait no, the user's table for Case 3 shows:

Looking at the user's table for Case 3:

| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity              |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 3       | 2024-01-12 09:00    | Application Received  |
| 3       | 2024-01-14 10:00    | Credit Check          |
| 3       | 2024-01-14 11:00    | Risk Assessment       |
| 3       | 2024-01-14 12:00    | Loan Decision (Approved) |
| 3       | 2024-01-16 15:00    | Inform Applicant      | *(Later than recommended 48 hours - again a desideratum violation)* 
| 3       | 2024-01-17 09:00    | Finalize Documentation|
| 3       | 2024-01-17 10:00    | Close Case            |

Wait, so after the Loan Decision on Jan 14 12:00, the next step is Inform Applicant on Jan 16 15:00. That's two days later. 48 hours from the decision would be Jan 16 12:00, so 15:00 is 3 hours late. That's a desideratum violation but not a normative one. 

Then Finalize Documentation is on Jan 17 09:00, which is after the Inform Applicant on Jan 16 15:00. That's okay because for approved loans, Finalize must come before closing. The closing is at 10:00 on Jan 17, so Finalize is before that. So that's correct. The Finalize is done before closing, so that's okay. 

Additionally, the Follow-up Call: the desideratum recommends a follow-up call before closing. But in Case 3, there's no mention of a follow-up call. The last activity is Close Case on Jan 17 10:00. The desideratum says it's encouraged but not required. So not having a follow-up call is a desideratum violation, but not a normative one. 

So for Case 3, the normative constraints are all met? Let's confirm:

Sequence: Application -> Credit Check (even though delayed, but before Risk Assessment) -> Risk Assessment -> Decision -> Inform -> Finalize (after decision) -> Close. All steps are in order, no skips. So the normative rules are followed. The delays in Credit Check time and informing after 48 hours are desiderata issues, not strict violations.

Now moving to the second part: identify which cases fail the desiderata. 

Desiderata are the recommended best practices but not strict rules. So for each case, check for:

1. Credit Check within 24 hours of application. 
2. Inform applicant within 48 hours of decision.
3. Perform Follow-up call before closing.

Case 1:
- Credit Check was at 09:30, which is 30 minutes after application received. That's well within 24 hours. Good.
- Inform Applicant was at 13:00, which is 2.5 hours after decision (11:00). Way under 48 hours. Good.
- Follow-up call: Not mentioned. The case closed at 14:00, but no follow-up call. So missing the follow-up call. That's a desideratum violation.

Case 2:
- Credit Check was at 08:20, but the application was received at 08:00. Wait, the Credit Check is at 08:20, which is 20 minutes after application received. That's within 24 hours. Wait but the problem in Case 2 was the ordering (Credit after Risk). But regarding timing for Credit Check: it was done quickly, so that's okay for desiderata. 

Wait, but the main desiderata issues here: the Credit Check timing is okay. The problem in Case 2 is the ordering (normative violation) and finalizing after rejection (another normative violation). 

For the desiderata in Case 2: 
- The Inform Applicant was at 10:00, which is 30 minutes after the decision (09:30). That's within 48 hours. 
- Follow-up call: Not mentioned. The case closed at 10:30. No follow-up call, so that's a desideratum violation. 

Case 3:
- Credit Check was on Jan 14 10:00, which is 2 days after application received on Jan 12. That's 48 hours later. The desideratum recommends within 24 hours. So that's a violation of the timing recommendation. 
- Inform Applicant was on Jan 16 15:00, which was 3 hours after the 48-hour window (since decision was on Jan 14 12:00, 48 hours would end on Jan 16 12:00). So that's a violation of the inform within 48 hours. 
- Follow-up call: Not present. The case closed on Jan 17 10:00, so no follow-up call. Another desideratum violation. 

So summarizing:

Normative violations (strict rules broken):

Case 2 has two normative violations:
1. Credit Check after Risk Assessment (sequence violation).
2. Finalizing documentation after rejection (since rejected, must close without finalizing, but they did finalize before closing).

Case 3: No normative violations. The sequence is correct, even though timings were off. 

Desiderata violations (recommended but not strict):

Case 1: No Credit Check timing issue, but missed follow-up call. So one desideratum violation (missing follow-up).

Case 2: 
- Credit Check timing was okay (within 24h?), actually 20 minutes after application, so that's good. 
- Inform was within 48h (30 mins after decision). 
- Missing follow-up call. So only one desideratum violation (no follow-up).

Case 3: 
- Credit Check took 48 hours (exceeding 24h recommendation). 
- Inform was 3 hours late (over 48h). 
- No follow-up call. So three desiderata violations here.

Now, the user also asks for suggestions or justifications where possible. Let's think about possible justifications.

For Case 2's Credit Check after Risk Assessment: the process must strictly follow the sequence, so there's no justification here. It's a clear violation of the normative rules. 

For the finalization after rejection in Case 2: the rule is explicit that if rejected, you can't finalize before closing. They did finalize before closing, so that's a clear violation. 

Case 3's Credit Check delay: while the strict rules don't require a time limit, the desiderata do. The user might argue that the Credit Check was delayed due to an external factor (like waiting for additional data), but the process still followed the sequence. However, the normative rules don't allow for such delays in the sequence, only the timing is a desideratum. 

For the inform applicant in Case 3 being late: again, the strict rules don't require a time limit, so the delay isn't a normative issue, but it's against the recommendation. Maybe the system was overwhelmed, or the decision took longer than expected, but the process steps were followed correctly. 

Follow-up call in all cases: the desiderata recommend it but it's not mandatory. So in cases where it's missing, it's just a best practice not enforced by rules. 

So for justifications where possible, perhaps in Case 3's Credit Check delay, one could argue that the Credit Check was pending external data (like a background check taking longer), but the normative rules don't require that to be within a specific time. However, the user might still consider that a desideratum violation even if there's a reason. 

Putting this all together, the answers would be structured as:

1. Normative violations:
   - Case 2 has two violations (order and finalization after rejection).
   - Case 3 has none.

2. Desiderata violations:
   - Case 1: missing follow-up call.
   - Case 2: missing follow-up call.
   - Case 3: Credit Check late, inform applicant late, no follow-up call.

Then, for justifications where applicable (like for Case 3's Credit Check delay), but since the question says "when possible", perhaps only where there's ambiguity. In this case, the normative rules don't have time constraints, so the delays in Credit Check and inform are just desiderata, not normative. So maybe no need for justifications unless the user wants to explain why certain things are considered violations or not.

So final answer would list each case's violations in each category, explain why, and note any justifications where applicable.

### **1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Rules Broken)**  
**Case 2** violates the normative rules in two ways:  
1. **Incorrect Sequence of Credit Check and Risk Assessment**:  
   - The Risk Assessment occurred **before** the Credit Check (08:20 vs. 09:00). This directly violates the ordering rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.  
   - This also implies a failure to perform foundational steps (Credit Check) before proceeding to critical analysis (Risk Assessment), risking incomplete or inaccurate decisions.  

2. **Finalizing Documentation After Rejection**:  
   - After rejecting the loan (09:30), the process proceeded to Finalize Documentation (10:00) **before** closing the case (10:30). This violates the rule that documentation finalization is **only allowed** for approved loans.  

**Case 3** does **not** violate any normative rules.  
- **Sequence Compliance**: All steps follow the required order:  
  Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize (if approved)  Close Case.  
- **No Skipping or Reversal**: All activities occur in the correct temporal sequence, even if timing (e.g., Credit Check delay) deviates from recommendations.  

---

### **2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended Best Practices Not Followed)**  
**Case 1** fails to meet one desideratum:  
- **Missing Follow-Up Call**:  
  The process closed the case at 14:00 but did not include a follow-up call to the applicant before closure. While not a strict violation, this is suboptimal as the recommendation encourages post-decision communication to confirm alignment.  

**Case 2** fails to meet one desideratum:  
- **Missing Follow-Up Call**:  
  Like Case 1, the case closed at 10:30 without a follow-up call. This is a minor deviation but reflects poor post-decision engagement.  

**Case 3** fails to meet **three desiderata**:  
1. **Credit Check Delay**:  
   - The Credit Check occurred **48 hours** after the application was received (10:00 on Jan 14 vs. application at 09:00 on Jan 12). The desideratum recommends completion within **24 hours**.  
   - *Justification*: While the normative rules do not mandate a time limit, the delay may indicate inefficiency or external dependencies (e.g., pending background checks), but it remains a suboptimal practice.  

2. **Inform Applicant After 48-Hour Window**:  
   - The Inform Applicant step occurred **3 hours late** (15:00 on Jan 16 vs. a recommended deadline of 12:00 on Jan 16).  
   - *Justification*: The decision was made on Jan 14 at 12:00, so the 48-hour window ended at 12:00 on Jan 16. The delay could stem from manual processing or administrative bottlenecks.  

3. **Missing Follow-Up Call**:  
   - No follow-up call was made before closing the case at 10:00 on Jan 17. This is a recurring issue across all cases but is explicitly encouraged as a best practice.

### **Summary Table**  
| **Case** | **Normative Violations** | **Desiderata Violations** |  
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|  
| **1**    | None                     | Missing follow-up call   |  
| **2**    | Sequence error (Credit Check after Risk Assessment) + Finalize after rejection | Missing follow-up call |  
| **3**    | None                     | Credit Check delay, Inform delay, Missing follow-up call |  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Normative Rules Are Non-Negotiable**: Cases violating sequence or step-ordering rules (e.g., Case 2) are fundamentally flawed and require correction.  
- **Desiderata Are Flexible**: Delays in timing or missing follow-ups (e.g., in Case 3) are not catastrophic but indicate room for process optimization.  
- **Justifications for Delays**: While not excusing normative violations, delays in Credit Check (Case 3) or inform timing (Case 3) may reflect operational constraints but should be addressed to meet best practices.
