### Justification of Renaming

- **Verify Documents (C001 & C003)**  
  - Renamed the first occurrence to “Initial Document/Physical ID Verification” to signal the first, baseline check.  
  - Renamed the second occurrence to “Document Re-verification After Additional Submission/After Account Adjustment” to capture that it is a follow-up check prompted by new information or corrections.

- **Call Customer (C002)**  
  - First call renamed to “Clarification Call to Customer” to reflect the purpose of clarifying an account discrepancy.  
  - Second call renamed to “Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments” to indicate it’s a confirmation step after internal changes.

- **Call Customer (C001 & C003)**  
  - Though not repeated within those cases, they were given contextual names (“Call Customer to Request Missing Documents” and “Call Customer to Return to Branch”) to highlight their specific purposes, reducing ambiguity if additional calls occur later in the same case.

Other activities were left unchanged because they do not recur within the same case or their meanings are already specific.
