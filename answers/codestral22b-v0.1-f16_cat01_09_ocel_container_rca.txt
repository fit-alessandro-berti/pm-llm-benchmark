1. **Forklift utilization**: The three Forklifts seem to have a high frequency of transition between states, which could indicate a bottleneck or overutilization in certain processes such as "Bring to Loading Bay", "Weigh", and "Load to Vehicle". This could be due to limitations in the number of forklifts available, or inefficient transitions that result in unnecessary delays.

2. **Duration of events**: Certain events such as "Reschedule Container" -> "Depart", "Depart" -> "Reschedule Container", and "Place in Stock" -> "Load to Vehicle" have high durations compared to other events, indicating a potential slowdown or issue during these processes.

3. **Frequency of rescheduling**: The Transport Document process has a notable frequency of "Reschedule Container" events. This could be due to unforeseen circumstances, vehicle availability issues, or other factors that require the transport document to be rescheduled. Frequent rescheduling can lead to increased costs and delays.

4. **Transition between Customer Order and Transport Document**: The transition from "Create Transport Document" to "Book Vehicles" has a relatively high duration compared to other transitions, which could indicate a bottleneck in this process. This could be due to limitations in the vehicle booking system or other factors that slow down the transition.

5. **Number of objects**: The number of objects being handled in certain transitions, such as "Reschedule Container" and "Depart", is high compared to others. This could indicate a need for additional resources or capacity to handle these volumes efficiently.

6. **Self-transitioning events**: Events like "Place in Stock" -> "Place in Stock" and "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" occurring multiple times suggest potential looping or repeating issues that need to be addressed. These could lead to unnecessary delays and increased costs.
