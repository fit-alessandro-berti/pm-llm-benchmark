Here is the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process described.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # If the first activity occurs, it must occur the same number of times as the second.
    # 1. Invoice Customer and Record Payment are tied to the same business transaction.
    # 2. Reserve Items and Pick Items usually happen in strict 1:1 pairs per item, 
    #    or just once per case in simpler views.
    'equivalence': {('IC', 'RP'), ('RI', 'PI')}, 

    # If the first activity occurs, the second must have happened previously.
    # 1. You cannot Record Payment without Invoicing.
    # 2. You cannot Dispatch without generating a label.
    # 3. You cannot Invoice without a Record of Payment (or at least the order being finalized).
    # 4. You cannot Generate Label without Packing.
    'always_before': {('RP', 'IC'), ('D', 'GSL'), ('IC', 'PO'), ('GSL', 'PO')},

    # If the first activity occurs, the second must happen in a future event.
    # 1. Receive Order implies Check Availability must follow.
    # 2. Check Availability implies Reserve Items must follow.
    # 3. Reserve Items implies Pick Items must follow.
    # 4. Pick Items implies Quality Check must follow.
    # 5. Quality Check implies Pack Order must follow.
    # 6. Pack Order implies Generate Shipping Label must follow.
    # 7. Generate Shipping Label implies Dispatch must follow.
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D')
    },

    # Activities that absolutely cannot exist in the same case.
    # (Assuming a strictly standard process where one path is taken per order)
    'never_together': set(),

    # Bounds on the number of occurrences per case.
    # RO, CA, RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, RP: Must happen exactly once per order case.
    # IC: May happen (1) or may not happen (0) depending on payment method (e.g., pre-paid vs invoice).
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1}, 'CA': {1}, 'RI': {1}, 'PI': {1}, 
        'QC': {1}, 'PO': {1}, 'GSL': {1}, 'D': {1}, 
        'RP': {1}, 'IC': {0, 1}
    },

    # Directly Follows constraints (A is immediately followed by B).
    # Strict workflow steps where no other activities intervene.
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D')
    }
}
