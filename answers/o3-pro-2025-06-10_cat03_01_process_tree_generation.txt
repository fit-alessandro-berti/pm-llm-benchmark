One compact way to write the whole scenario with the four process-tree operators is the following single tree (rooted in an overall SEQUENCE):

-> (                                              overall order
    'A',                                          Arrival
    'RG',                                         Registration
    'IA',                                         Intake Assessment
    -> ( 'TI', 'TC' ),                            triage interview  classification
    X ( 'CE', 'FBP' ),                            initial diagnostic XOR
                                                  ------------------------------
    * (                                           diagnostic / treatment loop
        -> (                                      “do-part” of the loop
            'SC',                                 Specialist Consultation
            X ( 'TM', 'SPT' ),                    treatment XOR
            'RDT',                                re-diagnostic step
            X ( 'FCE', 'FBA' )                    follow-up test XOR
        ),
        tau                                       “redo-part’’ (nothing between
    ),                                            successive iterations)
                                                  ------------------------------
    + ( 'AI', 'NC' ),                             imaging  nutritional counselling
    -> ( 'FAS', 'DDI' ),                          schedule follow-up  discharge info
    + ( 'BL', 'ICP', 'MRF' )                      billing  insurance  records
)                                                 patient released when finished
