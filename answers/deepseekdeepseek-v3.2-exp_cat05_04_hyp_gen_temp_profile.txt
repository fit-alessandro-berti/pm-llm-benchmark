### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: The average time of ~25 hours has an unusually low standard deviation (1 hour), suggesting a rigid, artificially enforced schedule rather than natural process variation.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: Extremely long average delay (7 days) with high variability (2 days standard deviation) indicates inconsistent notification practices with significant delays.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**: Quick 2-hour average closure after assignment, potentially bypassing required evaluation and approval steps.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: Very short 5-minute average transition suggests automated or rushed notifications that may skip quality checks.

5. **E to C (Evaluate to Close)**: High standard deviation (50 minutes) relative to the 1-hour average indicates inconsistent closing practices after evaluation.

### Hypotheses for the Anomalies

1. **R to P rigidity**: Automated approval system with fixed scheduling, or claims being batched for approval at specific times regardless of submission time.

2. **P to N delays**: Manual notification process with resource constraints, backlog accumulation, or dependency on external systems causing variable delays.

3. **A to C quick closures**: Adjusters closing claims prematurely without proper evaluation, possibly for low-value claims or system errors allowing incomplete processing.

4. **E to N rapid transitions**: Fully automated notification system triggered immediately after evaluation, potentially without human review.

5. **Inconsistent E to C timing**: Different adjuster practices - some closing immediately after evaluation while others take additional time for documentation.

### SQL Verification Queries

**1. Identify claims with rigid R to P timing:**
```sql
SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - 
                          MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) as r_to_p_seconds
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('R', 'P')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - 
                          MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) 
       BETWEEN 86400 AND 93600  -- 24-26 hour range
   AND COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2;
```

**2. Investigate P to N delay patterns:**
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.region,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                          MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END))) as p_to_n_seconds
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE ce.activity IN ('P', 'N')
GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.region
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                          MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END))) > 432000  -- >5 days
ORDER BY p_to_n_seconds DESC;
```

**3. Detect premature closures after assignment:**
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id, c.claim_amount, ce.resource as adjuster,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                          MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END))) as a_to_c_seconds
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity IN ('A', 'C')
GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.claim_amount, ce.resource
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                          MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END))) < 7200  -- <2 hours
   AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce2 
       WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id 
       AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P')
   );
```

**4. Analyze E to N rapid transitions by adjuster:**
```sql
SELECT ce.resource as adjuster, COUNT(*) as rapid_notifications,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                              MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END)))) as avg_e_to_n_seconds
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity IN ('E', 'N')
GROUP BY ce.resource, ce.claim_id
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                              MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END)))) < 600  -- <10 minutes
ORDER BY rapid_notifications DESC;
```

**5. Correlate timing anomalies with claim characteristics:**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_type, a.specialization, a.region,
       COUNT(*) as total_claims,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                              MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END)))) as avg_r_to_p,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                              MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END)))) as avg_p_to_n
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE ce.activity IN ('R', 'P', 'N')
GROUP BY c.claim_type, a.specialization, a.region
ORDER BY avg_p_to_n DESC;
```
