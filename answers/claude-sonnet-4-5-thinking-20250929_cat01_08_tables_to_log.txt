# Event Log for Process Mining

Below is the comprehensive event log derived from the ERP system tables. Each row represents a single event in the order fulfillment process.

## Assumptions Made:
1. **Case ID**: `order_id` is used as the primary case identifier
2. **Activity Naming**: 
   - "Order Created" for order initiation
   - "Item Picked" for each item picking event (separate events for each line item)
   - "Order Dispatched" for delivery dispatch
   - "Order Arrived" for delivery arrival
   - "Invoice Issued" for invoice generation
   - "Payment Received" for payment transactions
3. **Resources**: Mapped from resource tables where available; carrier IDs used for delivery events
4. **Multiple Events**: Orders with multiple items, deliveries, invoices, or payments generate separate events for each
5. **Incomplete Cases**: Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment records (process incomplete)
