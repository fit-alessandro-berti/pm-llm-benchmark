### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model  

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**  
   - **Anomaly:** The average time is ~25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation (1 hour).  
   - **Possible Reasons:**  
     - Automated approval processes may enforce rigid timing, bypassing manual review.  
     - Claims may be pre-approved or fast-tracked under certain conditions.  

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**  
   - **Anomaly:** Extremely long average delay (7 days) with high variability (STDEV = 2 days).  
   - **Possible Reasons:**  
     - Manual notification backlog due to understaffing.  
     - Some claims may require additional post-approval verification, causing delays.  

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**  
   - **Anomaly:** Quick closure (2 hours on average) without intermediate steps like Evaluate or Approve.  
   - **Possible Reasons:**  
     - Claims may be auto-closed due to trivial amounts or policy rules.  
     - Adjusters might prematurely close claims without proper evaluation.  

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**  
   - **Anomaly:** Very short average time (5 minutes) between Evaluate and Notify.  
   - **Possible Reasons:**  
     - Automated notifications triggered immediately after evaluation.  
     - Possible data logging errors where intermediate steps are missing.

### Verification SQL Queries  

#### 1. **Check Claims with Rigid R → P Timing**  
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END))) / 3600 AS hours_R_to_P
FROM 
    claims c
JOIN 
    claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce.activity IN ('R', 'P')
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id, c.claim_type
HAVING 
    ABS(hours_R_to_P - 25) < 1  -- Check claims with R→P time close to 25 hours
ORDER BY 
    hours_R_to_P;
```

#### 2. **Identify Long P → N Delays**  
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    a.adjuster_id,
    a.region,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END))) / 86400 AS days_P_to_N
FROM 
    claims c
JOIN 
    claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
JOIN 
    adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE 
    ce.activity IN ('P', 'N')
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id, a.adjuster_id, a.region
HAVING 
    days_P_to_N > 9  -- Claims with P→N time > 9 days (2 STDEV above mean)
ORDER BY 
    days_P_to_N DESC;
```

#### 3. **Find Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment**  
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    a.adjuster_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END))) / 3600 AS hours_A_to_C
FROM 
    claims c
JOIN 
    claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
JOIN 
    adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE 
    ce.activity IN ('A', 'C')
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.adjuster_id
HAVING 
    hours_A_to_C < 1  -- Claims closed within 1 hour of assignment
ORDER BY 
    hours_A_to_C;
```

#### 4. **Verify E → N Automation Hypothesis**  
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    ce.resource,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
                        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END))) / 60 AS minutes_E_to_N
FROM 
    claims c
JOIN 
    claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce.activity IN ('E', 'N')
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_id, ce.resource
HAVING 
    minutes_E_to_N < 2  -- Claims with E→N time < 2 minutes
ORDER BY 
    minutes_E_to_N;
```

These queries help validate whether anomalies stem from automation, resource constraints, or data inconsistencies by isolating extreme cases and correlating them with adjusters, regions, or claim types.
