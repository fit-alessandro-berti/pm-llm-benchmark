### Analysis of the Two POWL Models in Relation to the Standard Hire-to-Retire Process

The **Hire-to-Retire process** generally follows a straightforward sequential logic aiming to ensure proper employee onboarding and integration. A typical process flow might look like this:

1. **Post a Job Advertisement:** Initiating the hiring process to announce a job vacancy.
2. **Screen Candidates:** Evaluating applicants for initial selection.
3. **Conduct Interviews:** Meeting candidates for a deeper assessment.
4. **Make a Hiring Decision:** Choosing the most suitable candidate.
5. **Onboard the Employee:** Welcoming the new hire and aligning them with organizational policies, training, etc.
6. **Add the New Hire to Payroll Systems:** Ensuring the employee is paid and their financial paperwork is in order.
7. **Close the Hiring Process Case:** Finalizing all activities, signaling the process' formal completion.

The models provided deviate from this sequence in various ways. Below is a detailed breakdown of the models' respective anomalies.

### Anomalies in POWL Model 1

#### **Analysis of Model Logic:**
1. In **POWL Model 1**, the following control-flow is defined:
   - The process starts with "Post_Job_Ad," followed by "Screen_Candidates."
   - "Conduct_Interviews" and "Make_Hiring_Decision" are defined as parallel activities, as both arise from "Screen_Candidates."
   - After "Make_Hiring_Decision," onboarding is performed ("Onboard_Employee"), which leads to adding the new hire to payroll ("Add_to_Payroll") and then closing the case ("Close_Case").
   
2. The main anomaly lies in allowing **parallel execution** of "Screen_Candidates" and "Conduct_Interviews":
   - Realistically, interviewing candidates should take place only after they have been screened. The anomaly here violates the logical dependency of processes (i.e., screening needs to precede interviews).
   - This may result in interviewing unselected or unqualified candidates, which is inefficient and counterproductive.

#### **Severity of Anomalies:**
- The anomaly has **medium severity**, as it introduces unnecessary inefficiencies and potential process confusion. However, the process can still technically deliver the desired outcomes with proper allowances.
- The sequence from "Make_Hiring_Decision" onward is straightforward and consistent with the standard process.

### Anomalies in POWL Model 2

#### **Analysis of Model Logic:**
1. In **POWL Model 2**, the process includes more complex variability:
   - There is a loop on "Onboard_Employee," allowing multiple onboarding attempts or skipping onboarding altogether through a silent transition.
   - Additionally, an XOR operator is used for "Add_to_Payroll," enabling the payroll step to either be executed or skipped entirely.
   - "Post_Job_Ad" is followed by both "Screen_Candidates" and "Conduct_Interviews," implying these can occur in parallel rather than sequentially.
   - The process ends with "Close_Case."
   
2. Anomalies are more significant here than in Model 1:
   - **Skipping Onboarding:** Allowing onboarding to be skipped is a high-severity anomaly, as onboarding is a critical component in hiring a new employee. Without onboarding, employees may not receive necessary training, access to systems, or vital organizational information.
   - **Skipping Payroll Setup:** Skipping payroll introduces a severe financial and legal issue—employees must be paid for their work.
   - **Parallel Screening and Interviews:** Similar to Model 1, the process allows screening and interviews to occur in parallel, which violates logical process dependencies (i.e., interviews should follow candidate screening). This is a medium-severity anomaly.

#### **Severity of Anomalies:**
- The anomalies of **skipping onboarding** and **payroll setup** are of **high severity**, as they fundamentally undermine the purpose of the Hire-to-Retire process.
- The parallel execution of screening and interviews is a **medium-severity anomaly** in this model as well.

### Comparison of Models and Alignment to Normative Process

Both models introduce notable deviations from the normative Hire-to-Retire process. However, **POWL Model 1** aligns more closely with the expected process sequence compared to **POWL Model 2.**

#### Key Reasons Why Model 1 Is Closer to Normative:
1. **Critical Steps Are Always Present:** Model 1 ensures that onboarding and payroll are always executed, which is essential for process correctness and employee integration. In Model 2, these crucial tasks can be skipped—a scenario that violates fundamental process integrity.
   
2. **Sequencing of Steps:** Although Model 1 introduces parallel execution between "Screen_Candidates" and "Conduct_Interviews," this is a less severe anomaly than skipping critical steps in Model 2. The rest of Model 1's process flows logically from step to step.

3. **Real-world Feasibility:** The loop structure and XOR operator in Model 2 introduce unfeasible scenarios (e.g., skipping onboarding or payroll) that undermine the practicality and reliability of the process.

### Conclusion

- **Recommendation:** **POWL Model 1** is the better representation of a Hire-to-Retire process. It has fewer and less severe anomalies, and its deviations are more manageable in real-world scenarios.
- **Rationale:** While both models deviate from the ideal process, POWL Model 1 ensures critical hiring steps (onboarding and payroll) are retained, whereas Model 2 risks skipping these essential elements, creating major process violations.
