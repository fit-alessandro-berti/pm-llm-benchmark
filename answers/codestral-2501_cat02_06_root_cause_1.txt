### Analysis of the Event Log

#### 1. Identifying Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

To identify cases with significantly longer resolution times, we need to calculate the total resolution time for each case. The total resolution time is the difference between the "Close Ticket" timestamp and the "Receive Ticket" timestamp.

Let's calculate the total resolution time for each case:

| Case ID | Receive Ticket Timestamp | Close Ticket Timestamp | Total Resolution Time |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00        | 2024-03-01 10:15       | 2 hours 15 minutes     |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05        | 2024-03-02 09:15       | 25 hours 10 minutes   |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10        | 2024-03-01 09:30       | 1 hour 20 minutes     |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20        | 2024-03-02 08:30       | 24 hours 10 minutes   |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25        | 2024-03-03 09:30       | 49 hours 5 minutes    |

From the above calculations, we can see that **Case 105** has the longest total resolution time of 49 hours 5 minutes.

#### 2. Determining Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

Let's analyze the activities for each case to identify potential root causes:

- **Case 101**: No escalations, quick resolution.
- **Case 102**: Escalated to Level-2 Agent after 2.5 hours, significant delay in investigation and resolution.
- **Case 103**: No escalations, quick resolution.
- **Case 104**: No escalations, significant delay in investigation.
- **Case 105**: Escalated to Level-2 Agent after 1.5 hours, significant delay in investigation and resolution.

**Potential Root Causes**:
- **Escalations**: Cases 102 and 105 experienced escalations, which significantly increased their resolution times.
- **Investigation Delays**: Cases 102, 104, and 105 had long waiting times between activities, particularly in the investigation phase.

#### 3. Proposing Insights and Recommendations

**Insights**:
- Escalations to higher-level agents introduce additional complexity and often longer resolution times.
- Long waiting times between activities, especially during the investigation phase, can significantly increase the overall resolution time.

**Recommendations**:
1. **Reduce Escalation Frequency**: Implement a system to minimize unnecessary escalations. This could involve training Level-1 agents to handle a broader range of issues or using automated tools to quickly identify and resolve simpler issues.
2. **Optimize Investigation Process**: Streamline the investigation process to reduce waiting times. This could involve:
   - Providing Level-1 agents with better tools and resources to investigate issues more efficiently.
   - Implementing a system to prioritize tickets based on severity and urgency.
   - Ensuring that Level-2 agents are available and responsive to handle escalated cases promptly.
3. **Monitor and Analyze Performance**: Regularly monitor the performance of the support process and analyze the data to identify trends and areas for improvement. This can help in making data-driven decisions to optimize the process.
4. **Training and Support**: Provide ongoing training for support agents to improve their skills and efficiency. This can help in reducing the need for escalations and speeding up the resolution process.

By addressing these factors, the customer support process can be optimized to reduce resolution times and improve overall performance.
