Merged log (chronological by chosen primary timestamp — System A when available). Matching rules used: events matched when order_id same AND timestamps within a 5-second tolerance (<= 5s). I chose 5s to account for System A timestamps representing when events were received (not necessarily started) and small clock/recording offsets. When matched, I kept System A’s timestamp as primary_timestamp and included System B’s timestamp as secondary_timestamp. All attributes from both systems are preserved; events only seen in one log are included as-origin entries.

Merged events:

1) primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z (System A)  
   secondary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z (System B)  
   canonical_event: Order Received  
   event_type_A: Order Received  
   event_name_B: OrderReceived  
   order_id: Order#1234  
   user_id: u45  
   resource_id: r10  
   notes: "Event captured at warehouse system"  
   origin: A + B (merged)  
   Reasoning: timestamps differ by 2s (<=5s) and names are semantically identical  merged. Kept A timestamp as primary.

2) primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z (System A)  
   secondary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z (System B)  
   canonical_event: Order Validated  
   event_type_A: Order Validated  
   event_name_B: OrderValidation  
   order_id: Order#1234  
   user_id: u12  
   resource_id: r10  
   notes: "Cross-check inventory"  
   origin: A + B (merged)  
   Reasoning: 1s difference and matching semantics  merged.

3) primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z (System A)  
   secondary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z (System B)  
   canonical_event: Payment Processed / PaymentCheck  
   event_type_A: Payment Processed  
   event_name_B: PaymentCheck  
   order_id: Order#1234  
   user_id: u12  
   resource_id: r99  
   notes: "Payment gateway delay"  
   origin: A + B (merged)  
   Reasoning: names indicate the same payment activity; timestamps differ by 5s (equal to tolerance) so I merged and kept A time as primary. Included B’s user/resource/notes that A lacked.

4) primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z (System B only)  
   secondary_timestamp: (none in A)  
   canonical_event: Quality Check  
   event_type_A: (none)  
   event_name_B: Quality Check  
   order_id: Order#1234  
   user_id: u45  
   resource_id: r11  
   notes: "Random inspection"  
   origin: B only  
   Reasoning: No A event within tolerance around 10:03:00 and semantic name unique to B  kept as a standalone B-origin event.

5) primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z (System A)  
   secondary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z (System B)  
   canonical_event: Item Shipped / Shipping  
   event_type_A: Item Shipped  
   event_name_B: Shipping  
   order_id: Order#1234  
   user_id: u45  
   resource_id: r10  
   notes: "Package handed to courier"  
   origin: A + B (merged)  
   Reasoning: 2s difference and matching semantics  merged. Kept A timestamp primary.

6) primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z (System A only)  
   secondary_timestamp: (none in B)  
   canonical_event: Item Delivered  
   event_type_A: Item Delivered  
   event_name_B: (none)  
   order_id: Order#1234  
   user_id: (none)  
   resource_id: (none)  
   notes: (none)  
   origin: A only  
   Reasoning: Appears only in A; no B event within tolerance  include as A-only.

Notes on policy/choices and conflict resolution:
- Tolerance chosen: <= 5 seconds. I explicitly increased the example 2s tolerance to 5s to account for System A’s “received” timestamps and small clock offsets; this allowed logical merges for payment where a 5s offset existed. If you prefer a stricter tolerance (e.g., <=2s), the Payment Processed / PaymentCheck events would remain separate — I can re-run with that rule if you want.
- When merged, I preserved all attributes from both logs. System A timestamp used as primary when present; System B timestamp recorded as secondary_timestamp. If you prefer to use the earlier timestamp as canonical, I can switch.
- Events present only in one log are included with an origin flag indicating which system supplied the data.
- Semantic matching: when event names are clearly the same concept but different naming conventions (Order Received / OrderReceived, Item Shipped / Shipping, Order Validated / OrderValidation), I merged if within tolerance. For Payment, despite slightly different names (Payment Processed vs PaymentCheck), the notes and context made it reasonable to merge.
- Quality Check is a distinct operational activity (random inspection) that appears only in B; kept separate so the merged timeline preserves that additional operational detail.

If you want the merged log exported in CSV/JSON or with a different canonical timestamp policy (e.g., use earliest timestamp, or use System B as primary), tell me which format/policy and I’ll produce it.
