Here’s the updated `declare_model` with new constraints to mitigate bias in the loan application process, along with a rationale for each addition:

### Rationale for Added Constraints
1. **Existence of Sensitive Attribute Checks and Mitigation Steps**:
   - Added `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, and `CheckApplicantAge` to represent activities where sensitive attributes are disclosed.
   - Added `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` to enforce fairness checks when sensitive attributes are involved.

2. **Coexistence Constraints**:
   - Ensures that whenever a sensitive attribute is checked (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`), a `ManualReview` must also occur in the trace. This prevents decisions from being made solely based on sensitive attributes without human oversight.
   - Similarly, decisions like `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority` must coexist with `ManualReview` to ensure fairness.

3. **Response Constraints**:
   - Requires that any sensitive attribute check (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) must be followed by a `BiasMitigationCheck` before proceeding. This ensures that bias is explicitly addressed before decisions are made.

4. **Precedence Constraints**:
   - Ensures that `BiasMitigationCheck` must occur before `FinalDecision`, preventing final decisions from being made without addressing potential bias.

5. **Succession Constraints**:
   - Ensures that `ManualReview` must precede `FinalDecision`, reinforcing that human review is required before finalizing decisions.

6. **Noncoexistence Constraints**:
   - Prevents `FinalDecision` from occurring directly after a sensitive attribute check without mitigation (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace` cannot coexist with `FinalDecision` unless `ManualReview` is also present).

7. **Non-succession Constraints**:
   - Prevents direct succession from sensitive attribute checks (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to a decision like `Reject`, forcing an intermediate step (e.g., `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`) to avoid immediate biased outcomes.

### Key Fairness Outcomes:
- **No Direct Bias Paths**: Sensitive attributes cannot directly influence decisions without mitigation (e.g., no `CheckApplicantRace`  `Reject` without `ManualReview`).
- **Mandatory Mitigation**: Every sensitive attribute check triggers a mitigation step (`BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`), ensuring fairness is explicitly addressed.
- **Human Oversight**: Decisions involving sensitive groups (e.g., `Approve_Minority`) require human review, reducing algorithmic bias.

These constraints collectively enforce that the loan application process cannot discriminate based on sensitive attributes without explicit fairness checks.
