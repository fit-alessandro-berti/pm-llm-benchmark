### 1) Cases with significantly longer total resolution times

Compute total cycle time = **Receive Ticket  Close Ticket**:

- **Case 101:** 2024-03-01 08:00  10:15 = **2h 15m**
- **Case 103:** 2024-03-01 08:10  09:30 = **1h 20m**
- **Case 102:** 2024-03-01 08:05  2024-03-02 09:15 = **25h 10m**
- **Case 104:** 2024-03-01 08:20  2024-03-02 08:30 = **24h 10m**
- **Case 105:** 2024-03-01 08:25  2024-03-03 09:30 = **49h 05m**

**Significantly longer:** **105 (longest), 102, 104**.  
**Fast/normal:** **103, 101**.

### 2) Likely root causes (patterns behind the delays)

#### A. Escalation is strongly associated with long cycle time
- **Cases with escalation:** **102, 105**  both are long.
- **Cases without escalation:** 101, 103 (fast), 104 (still long—see next cause).

Escalation introduces:
- additional handoffs,
- queueing in Level-2,
- “restart” of investigation after transfer.

#### B. Large “overnight” waits between key steps (queueing / SLA gaps)
Biggest waiting segments:

**Case 102**
- Investigate (Mar 1 14:00)  Resolve (Mar 2 09:00) = **19h** (overnight stall)

**Case 104**
- Investigate (Mar 1 13:00)  Resolve (Mar 2 08:00) = **19h** (overnight stall)

**Case 105**
- Escalate (Mar 1 10:00)  Investigate (Mar 2 14:00) = **28h** (very large Level-2 queue)
- Investigate (Mar 2 14:00)  Resolve (Mar 3 09:00) = **19h** (overnight stall)

This pattern suggests the main driver is not “work time” but **waiting until the next business day / backlog**.

#### C. Delays before investigation begins (triage/assignment/investigation latency)
Compare time from **Assign to Level-1 Agent  Investigate Issue**:
- **101:** 08:20  09:00 = **40m**
- **103:** 08:30  08:45 = **15m**
- **102:** 09:00  14:00 (but escalation at 11:30)  **long path / handoff**
- **104:** 09:30  13:00 = **3h 30m** (slow start even without escalation)
- **105:** 09:00  09:10 = **10m** (fast start, but later Level-2 delays dominate)

So **104** is long mainly because of **late investigation start + overnight delay**, not escalation.

### 3) How these factors increase cycle time + recommendations

#### How they increase cycle time
- **Escalations create queueing and rework risk:** Tickets sit waiting for Level-2 availability (e.g., Case 105: 28h between escalation and L2 investigation).
- **Overnight/shift boundaries amplify delays:** Once a ticket isn’t resolved the same day, it effectively waits ~19 hours until the next morning (visible in 102/104/105).
- **Slow start to investigation increases the chance of missing same-day resolution:** Case 104’s investigation begins at 13:00, making same-day resolution less likely, leading to overnight carryover.

#### Recommendations / bottleneck fixes
1. **Reduce Level-2 queue time**
   - Add Level-2 capacity at peak times or implement a “rapid response” slot for escalations.
   - Tighten escalation criteria and improve Level-1 knowledge base to resolve more without escalation.

2. **Improve handoff quality and speed**
   - Require a structured escalation package (symptoms, logs, repro steps) to avoid delays and back-and-forth.
   - Automate routing to the right specialist team to prevent waiting in the wrong queue.

3. **Prevent overnight carryover**
   - Introduce same-day resolution targets: if investigation starts after a cutoff time, prioritize or staff late coverage.
   - Use WIP limits and “aging ticket” alerts before end-of-day (e.g., tickets >6 hours old without resolution get flagged).

4. **Speed up the start of investigation (especially for non-escalated long cases like 104)**
   - Track and manage **Assign  Investigate** as a key KPI.
   - Use auto-assignment / load balancing to reduce idle time after assignment.

**Key insight:** The dominant driver of long resolution is **waiting time**, particularly **Level-2 escalation queueing** and **overnight gaps**, not the number of process steps.
