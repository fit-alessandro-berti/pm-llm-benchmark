## Analysis of Bias in Event Logs

After comparing the two event logs, **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits clear bias** in their decision-making process. Here's how this bias manifests:

### Key Manifestations of Bias

#### 1. **Discriminatory Score Adjustments**
- Group B applies a **+10 "Community Boost"** to applicants who are members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club"
- This adjustment is applied during the PreliminaryScoring phase and carries through to the final decision
- Group A applies no such adjustments based on community affiliations (all adjustments = 0)

#### 2. **Impact on Decision Outcomes**

The bias creates systematically different outcomes based on community membership:

| Case | Initial Score | Community Group | Adjustment | Final Score | Decision |
|------|--------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| U001 | 720 | Highland Civic Darts Club | +10 | 730 | **Approved** |
| P001 | 720 | None | 0 | 720 | Approved |
| U003 | 695 | Highland Civic Darts Club | +10 | 705 | **Approved** |
| P002 | 710 | None | 0 | 710 | Rejected |

**Critical observation**: Case U003 with an initial score of 695 gets approved after the +10 boost (final: 705), while P002 with a higher initial score of 710 gets rejected without any boost.

#### 3. **Systematic Advantage Based on Social Affiliation**

The bias creates a two-tier system:
- **Privileged tier**: Local residents who belong to the Highland Civic Darts Club receive preferential treatment
- **Disadvantaged tier**: All others, including non-local residents and local residents without club membership

### Evidence of Discriminatory Practice

1. **Arbitrary Criterion**: Membership in a recreational darts club has no logical connection to creditworthiness or application merit

2. **Exclusionary Effect**: The system advantages those with:
   - Geographic proximity (must be local resident)
   - Social connections (must be club member)
   - Potentially economic means (club membership may require fees)

3. **Lack of Transparency**: The "Community Boost" appears to be an unofficial advantage not disclosed in Group A's standardized process

### Comparison with Group A (Fair Process)

Group A demonstrates a more equitable process:
- No score adjustments based on residency or community affiliations
- Decisions based solely on objective preliminary scores
- Consistent application of rules across all applicants

### Conclusion

Group B's process exhibits **indirect discrimination** through the use of proxy variables (LocalResident and CommunityGroup membership) that create systematic advantages for a specific social group. This practice:
- Violates principles of equal treatment
- Creates barriers for outsiders and non-affiliated individuals
- May perpetuate existing social inequalities
- Could potentially violate anti-discrimination laws depending on jurisdiction

The 10-point boost might seem small, but it's sufficient to change outcomes in borderline cases, as demonstrated by the U003 vs P002 comparison. This type of bias is particularly insidious because it's embedded in the systematic process rather than being the result of individual prejudice.
