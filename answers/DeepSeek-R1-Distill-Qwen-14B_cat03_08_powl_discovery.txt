Okay, so I need to create a POWL model based on the given event logs. Let me first understand the structure of the event logs and the activities involved.

Looking at the event logs, each case goes through several activities in a specific order. The key activities are OR, MS, QS, AS, IQC, TST, RT, PK, LB, DP, and D. 

Let's break down the flow of activities:

1. **Order Received (OR)** is the starting point for all cases.
2. After OR, **Material Sourcing (MS)** occurs.
3. Then comes **Quality Screening (QS)**.
4. Next is **Assembly (AS)**.
5. After AS, there's an **In-line Quality Check (IQC)**. Sometimes, IQC is repeated, like in Case 3 and 5.
6. Following IQC, there's another **AS** in some cases, which suggests that after IQC, assembly might need to be redone if quality checks fail.
7. Then comes **Testing (TST)**. If the test fails, **Re-Testing (RT)** is done, and this can loop back to TST again, as seen in Cases 1, 3, and 5.
8. After testing is resolved, the product is **Packaged (PK)**.
9. **Labeling (LB)** may or may not occur; in some cases, like Case 2 and 4, it's skipped.
10. After packaging and labeling, **Distribution Planning (DP)** happens.
11. Finally, the product is **Dispatched (D)**.

Now, I need to model this using POWL components: activities, silent transitions, choice operators (X), loops (*), and partial orders.

Let me think about the possible structures.

First, the main workflow starts with OR, then MS, QS, AS, and IQC. After IQC, there's a loop involving AS and IQC in some cases, which suggests a loop structure. Then comes TST, which might loop back if RT is needed.

So, the core workflow could be structured with loops and choices.

I think the overall structure will have a main partial order that sequences the main steps, with some branches and loops.

Let me outline the main steps:

- OR must come first.
- After OR, MS is done.
- Then QS.
- After QS, AS happens.
- Then IQC. After IQC, there's sometimes another AS and IQC. So, this part can be modeled as a loop.
- After IQC, there's TST. If TST fails, RT is done, which loops back to TST. So, this is another loop.
- After TST is successful, PK is done.
- Then, LB is optional. It can be done or skipped, so this might be a choice between doing LB or not.
- Finally, DP and D.

Wait, but LB isn't a choice that's explicitly modeled in all cases. Looking at the event logs:

- Cases 1,3,5 have LB after PK.
- Cases 2 and 4 skip LB.

So, this suggests that after PK, there's an optional step of LB. So, LB can be modeled as a choice between doing LB or not, but in the POWL model, perhaps it's a choice between two paths: one that includes LB and one that skips it.

Alternatively, LB could be a silent transition in some cases, but since it's an activity that can be present or not, it's better to model it as a choice.

So, after PK, there's a choice: either do LB or proceed to DP.

Wait, but in the logs, after PK, LB happens in some cases, and in others, it's followed directly by DP. So, the structure after PK is:

PK -> (LB) -> DP -> D

But in some cases, PK is followed directly by DP, skipping LB.

So, this suggests that after PK, there's a choice between two paths: one that includes LB and one that doesn't.

Therefore, the structure after PK would be a choice (X) between two options:

1. LB followed by DP
2. Silent transition (tau) leading directly to DP

Alternatively, since LB is an activity, the choice would be between executing LB and then DP, or skipping LB and proceeding to DP.

Wait, but in the logs, sometimes LB is skipped, so perhaps the choice is between LB and a silent transition. Or perhaps, the choice is between two options: one that includes LB and one that doesn't, both leading to DP.

Hmm, but in the logs, after PK, in cases where LB is skipped, the next activity is DP. So, the choice is between LB or nothing, both leading to DP. So, it's an XOR choice between LB and a silent transition (tau).

But in POWL, a choice is modeled with XOR (X) operator, which is an exclusive choice. So, the child models are the options. So, in this case, the choice would have two children: one is the LB activity, and the other is a silent transition.

Wait, but in the example code, the XOR operator's children are the options that are mutually exclusive. So, in this case, the choice after PK would be between doing LB or not. So, the children would be LB and a silent transition (tau). But since silent transitions don't have labels, perhaps they are represented as SilentTransition instances.

Wait, but in the example code, the children of OperatorPOWL are instances of POWL models. So, each child can be an activity, a choice, a loop, or a partial order.

So, for the LB choice, the XOR operator would have two children:

1. LB activity
2. Silent transition (tau)

So, after PK, there's an XOR choice between LB and tau, both leading to DP.

Alternatively, perhaps the choice is between LB followed by DP and tau followed by DP. But since both paths lead to DP, perhaps the DP is outside the choice.

Wait, no. Because in the logs, after PK, in cases where LB is done, it's followed by LB, then DP. In cases where LB is skipped, PK is followed by DP.

So, the structure after PK is:

PK -> (LB) -> DP -> D

or

PK -> (tau) -> DP -> D

Thus, the choice is between LB and tau, both leading to DP.

So, the XOR operator would have two children: LB and a silent transition (tau). Then, after the XOR, DP and D follow.

But in the POWL model, the XOR is a choice between two paths. So, the children of the XOR are the paths. So, each path is a sequence. So, one child is [LB, DP, D], and the other child is [tau, DP, D]. But that might complicate things since DP and D are common in both.

Alternatively, perhaps the XOR is between LB and nothing, and then DP and D are after. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

PK -> XOR (LB, tau) -> DP -> D

But in that case, the XOR would have two children: LB and a silent transition. After the XOR, DP and D are executed.

Wait, but in POWL, the XOR operator represents an exclusive choice between the sub-models. So, each child is a possible path. So, in this case, the XOR would have two children: one is the LB activity, and the other is a silent transition (tau). After the XOR, DP and D are executed, but they are outside the XOR.

Wait, but the XOR's children are the options. So, each child is a path. So, the first child would be LB followed by DP followed by D, and the second child would be tau followed by DP followed by D. But that would mean that the XOR is between two full paths, which might not be necessary because DP and D are common in both.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

PK -> XOR (LB, tau) -> DP -> D

But in this case, the XOR would have two children: LB and tau. Then, after the XOR, DP and D are executed. But I'm not sure if that's allowed because the XOR's children should be the possible paths, and each path should end with the point where it connects to the next part of the model.

Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to have the XOR after PK, with two children: one that is LB followed by DP, and the other that is tau followed by DP. Then, after DP, D is executed.

But that would make the XOR's children sequences that include DP. That might be acceptable, but it's a bit more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the XOR is just between LB and tau, and then DP and D are executed regardless of the choice. But I'm not sure how that would be modeled in POWL.

Wait, perhaps the XOR is a choice between LB and tau, and both are followed by DP and D. So, the structure would be:

PK -> (XOR between LB and tau) -> DP -> D

But in POWL, the XOR is a node that has two outgoing transitions: one to the LB activity and one to the tau. Then, both LB and tau have outgoing transitions to DP, and DP leads to D.

But in the current structure, the children of the XOR are the nodes that are the possible paths. So, each child is a model that represents one option. So, the first child is LB, and the second child is tau. Then, after the XOR, DP and D are executed.

Wait, but the XOR is a node that represents the choice. So, after the XOR, the model continues with DP and D. So, the children of the XOR are the models that represent the possible paths after the choice.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the XOR as:

PK -> XOR (LB, tau) -> DP -> D

Where the XOR node has two children: LB and tau. Then, after the XOR, the DP and D are executed. But I'm not sure if this is allowed because the XOR is a node that represents a choice, and the children are the possible paths. So, each child would have to be a model that ends at a point where it can continue to DP and D.

Alternatively, perhaps the XOR is followed by a partial order that includes DP and D, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the XOR is a choice between two paths, each leading to DP and D.

So, the first child of XOR is LB followed by DP followed by D, and the second child is tau followed by DP followed by D. Then, the XOR node would have these two children as possible paths.

But that might be more accurate, but it would create a lot of redundancy because both paths end with DP and D.

Alternatively, perhaps the model can be structured with the XOR between LB and tau, and then DP and D are in a partial order that follows the XOR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

After PK, there's an optional activity LB. So, the structure is:

PK -> (LB or tau) -> DP -> D

So, in POWL, this can be modeled as a choice (XOR) between two options: one that includes LB and one that doesn't. So, the XOR node would have two children:

1. LB activity
2. Silent transition (tau)

Then, after the XOR, DP and D are executed. But how is this connected? Because the XOR node is a choice, and each child is a possible path. So, after the XOR, the model continues with DP and D.

Wait, perhaps the XOR node is followed by a partial order that includes DP and D. So, the structure would be:

PK -> XOR (LB, tau) -> DP -> D

But in terms of POWL, the XOR node would have two children: LB and tau. Then, the DP and D would be connected to the XOR node as subsequent activities.

Wait, but in POWL, the nodes are connected via partial orders. So, the XOR node would have outgoing transitions to DP, and then DP leads to D.

Alternatively, perhaps the XOR node is connected to DP, and DP is connected to D, regardless of whether LB was taken or not.

So, the structure would be:

PK -> XOR (LB, tau) -> DP -> D

Where the XOR node has two children: LB and tau. Then, the XOR node is connected to DP via a partial order, and DP is connected to D.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure, but I think this is the correct approach.

Now, let's think about the loops.

After AS, there's an IQC, and sometimes AS is repeated. So, this suggests a loop structure.

Similarly, after TST, there's RT, which loops back to TST.

So, let's model these loops.

First, after AS, there's IQC. Then, sometimes AS is done again, followed by IQC again. So, this is a loop between AS and IQC.

So, this can be modeled as a loop operator (*). The loop would have two children: the first part is AS, and the second part is IQC. So, the loop node would be * (AS, IQC). This means that after AS, you can either exit the loop or execute IQC and then go back to AS.

Wait, no. The loop is defined as * (A, B), which means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So, in this case, A is AS, and B is IQC.

So, the loop would be: AS -> IQC, and then you can loop back to AS or exit.

But looking at the logs, after IQC, sometimes AS is done again, followed by another IQC, and so on.

So, the loop would be: AS -> IQC, and then the choice is to loop back to AS or proceed.

Similarly, after TST, if RT is done, it loops back to TST.

So, the loop for testing would be * (TST, RT), meaning after TST, you can either exit or execute RT and then go back to TST.

Wait, but in the logs, after TST, RT is done, and then TST is done again. So, the loop is TST -> RT -> TST.

So, the loop node would be * (TST, RT), meaning after TST, you can either exit or execute RT and then go back to TST.

Wait, but in the logs, after RT, TST is done again, not the other way around. So, perhaps the loop is * (TST, RT), meaning after TST, you can either exit or execute RT and then loop back to TST.

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, putting it all together.

The main workflow would be:

OR -> MS -> QS -> AS -> IQC -> [Loop (AS, IQC)] -> TST -> [Loop (TST, RT)] -> PK -> [XOR (LB, tau)] -> DP -> D

But this is a sequential view, but in reality, there are branches and loops, so the POWL model needs to capture this with the appropriate operators.

Let me outline the structure step by step.

1. Start with OR.
2. Then MS.
3. Then QS.
4. Then AS.
5. Then IQC.
6. At this point, there's a loop: after IQC, you can either proceed or go back to AS.
7. So, model this as a loop node: * (AS, IQC). Wait, no, because after IQC, you can either exit or go back to AS. So, the loop would be * (AS, IQC), but I'm not sure if the order is correct.

Wait, the loop is defined as * (A, B), which means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So, in this case, A is AS, B is IQC.

So, the loop node would be: after AS, you execute IQC, and then you can either exit the loop or go back to AS.

Wait, no. The loop is between A and B. So, the loop node is * (A, B), which means you execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

So, in this case, A is AS, B is IQC. So, the loop would be:

AS -> IQC, and then you can either exit or go back to AS.

But in the logs, after IQC, sometimes AS is done again, leading back to IQC. So, the loop is between AS and IQC.

So, the loop node would be * (AS, IQC). So, after AS, you execute IQC, and then you can either exit or go back to AS.

Wait, but in the logs, after IQC, AS is done again, which suggests that after IQC, you can choose to go back to AS.

So, the loop node would be * (AS, IQC), meaning after AS, you execute IQC, and then you can choose to loop back to AS or exit.

Yes, that makes sense.

Similarly, after TST, if RT is done, it loops back to TST. So, the loop node would be * (TST, RT).

Now, putting this into the overall structure.

After OR, MS, QS, we have AS, then IQC, then the loop * (AS, IQC). After the loop, we proceed to TST, then the loop * (TST, RT), then PK, XOR (LB, tau), then DP, then D.

But wait, after the loop * (AS, IQC), the next activity is TST. So, the loop is part of the sequence leading to TST.

So, the main sequence would be:

OR -> MS -> QS -> AS -> IQC -> * (AS, IQC) -> TST -> * (TST, RT) -> PK -> XOR (LB, tau) -> DP -> D

But this is a sequential view, but in reality, the loops allow for repetition. So, the POWL model needs to capture this with the loop operators.

Now, let's think about the overall structure as a partial order.

The entire process can be modeled as a strict partial order, with nodes representing the main steps and loops.

So, the root would be a StrictPartialOrder with nodes including the loops and the XOR choice.

Let me list all the nodes:

- OR: activity
- MS: activity
- QS: activity
- AS: activity
- IQC: activity
- Loop1: * (AS, IQC)
- TST: activity
- Loop2: * (TST, RT)
- PK: activity
- XOR_node: X (LB, tau)
- DP: activity
- D: activity

Now, the order in the partial order would enforce the sequence:

OR must come before MS, which comes before QS, which comes before AS, which comes before IQC, which is part of Loop1, which leads to TST, which is part of Loop2, which leads to PK, which leads to XOR_node, which leads to DP, which leads to D.

Additionally, within Loop1 and Loop2, the loop structures define their own partial orders.

The XOR_node has two children: LB and tau.

So, the root StrictPartialOrder would have all these nodes, and the order would be set to enforce the necessary sequence.

Let me try to outline the order relations:

- OR must be before MS.
- MS before QS.
- QS before AS.
- AS before IQC.
- IQC before Loop1's exit.
- Loop1's exit leads to TST.
- TST is part of Loop2, which leads to PK.
- PK leads to XOR_node.
- XOR_node leads to DP.
- DP leads to D.

Additionally, within the loops, the order is defined by the loop structure.

Now, how to model the loops and the XOR in the partial order.

The root is a StrictPartialOrder that includes all the nodes: OR, MS, QS, AS, IQC, Loop1, TST, Loop2, PK, XOR_node, DP, D.

The order would be:

OR --> MS
OR --> QS (Wait, no. OR must come before MS and QS. So, OR must be before MS and QS. But in the logs, OR is followed by MS, which is followed by QS. So, the order should be OR --> MS, MS --> QS, QS --> AS, etc.

Wait, perhaps the order should be a chain:

OR --> MS
MS --> QS
QS --> AS
AS --> IQC
IQC --> Loop1 (exit)
Loop1 (exit) --> TST
TST --> Loop2 (exit)
Loop2 (exit) --> PK
PK --> XOR_node
XOR_node --> DP
DP --> D

Additionally, within Loop1, the order is AS --> IQC, and IQC can lead back to AS or exit.

Similarly, within Loop2, TST --> RT, and RT leads back to TST or exit.

But in the partial order, the loops are represented as nodes, so the order relations are between the nodes.

So, the order would be:

OR.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
OR.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
OR.order.add_edge(QS, AS)
OR.order.add_edge(AS, IQC)
OR.order.add_edge(IQC, Loop1_exit)
OR.order.add_edge(Loop1_exit, TST)
OR.order.add_edge(TST, Loop2_exit)
OR.order.add_edge(Loop2_exit, PK)
OR.order.add_edge(PK, XOR_node)
OR.order.add_edge(XOR_node, DP)
OR.order.add_edge(DP, D)

But wait, Loop1 is a loop node, so its exit is a point after the loop. Similarly, Loop2's exit is after the loop.

So, the order relations would connect the exit points of the loops to the next activities.

Additionally, the XOR_node has two children: LB and tau. So, the order would have:

XOR_node.order.add_edge(LB, DP)
XOR_node.order.add_edge(tau, DP)

But wait, in the StrictPartialOrder, the nodes are the activities and the loop nodes. So, the XOR_node is a node that represents the choice between LB and tau. So, the order relations would be:

PK.order.add_edge(PK, XOR_node)

And within the XOR_node's partial order, the LB and tau would be ordered such that DP comes after both.

Wait, no. The XOR_node is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR, children [LB, tau]. So, the XOR_node has two children: LB and tau. Then, after the XOR_node, DP and D are executed.

But in the partial order, the XOR_node would have an order that connects the children to DP.

Wait, perhaps the XOR_node's order would have LB --> DP and tau --> DP.

So, the order within XOR_node would be:

XOR_node.order.add_edge(LB, DP)
XOR_node.order.add_edge(tau, DP)

Then, the main partial order would connect PK to XOR_node, and XOR_node's exit to DP and D.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to structure this step by step.

1. Create all the necessary nodes:

   - Activities: OR, MS, QS, AS, IQC, TST, RT, PK, LB, DP, D.

   - Loop nodes:

     - Loop1: * (AS, IQC)

     - Loop2: * (TST, RT)

   - XOR node: X (LB, tau)

2. Create the root StrictPartialOrder with all these nodes.

3. Set the order relations in the root to enforce the sequence:

   OR --> MS --> QS --> AS --> IQC --> Loop1.exit --> TST --> Loop2.exit --> PK --> XOR_node --> DP --> D

Wait, but Loop1 and Loop2 are nodes in the root's order. So, the root's order includes edges like:

OR.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
OR.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
OR.order.add_edge(QS, AS)
OR.order.add_edge(AS, IQC)
OR.order.add_edge(IQC, Loop1)
OR.order.add_edge(Loop1, TST)
OR.order.add_edge(TST, Loop2)
OR.order.add_edge(Loop2, PK)
OR.order.add_edge(PK, XOR_node)
OR.order.add_edge(XOR_node, DP)
OR.order.add_edge(DP, D)

Wait, but Loop1 and Loop2 are nodes in the root's order. So, after IQC, we have Loop1, which represents the loop. Then, after Loop1, we have TST, which is part of Loop2.

But perhaps the exit points of the loops are the points where the main sequence continues. So, the order would be:

OR --> MS --> QS --> AS --> IQC --> Loop1_exit --> TST --> Loop2_exit --> PK --> XOR_node --> DP --> D

But how are Loop1 and Loop2 structured?

Loop1 is a loop between AS and IQC. So, the loop node is * (AS, IQC). So, after AS, you can choose to exit the loop or go to IQC and then back to AS.

Similarly, Loop2 is * (TST, RT), so after TST, you can choose to exit or go to RT and back to TST.

So, in the main sequence, after IQC, we have Loop1, which may loop back to AS and IQC multiple times before proceeding to TST.

So, the main sequence in the root's order would be:

OR --> MS --> QS --> AS --> IQC --> Loop1.exit --> TST --> Loop2.exit --> PK --> XOR_node --> DP --> D

Now, the order within Loop1 is handled by the loop structure, and similarly for Loop2.

The XOR_node is a choice between LB and tau. So, in the root's order, after PK comes XOR_node, and after XOR_node comes DP.

But in the root's order, the nodes are the activities and the loop nodes. The XOR_node is a node in the root's order.

So, the root's order would have:

PK.order.add_edge(PK, XOR_node)
XOR_node.order.add_edge(XOR_node, DP)
DP.order.add_edge(DP, D)

But within the XOR_node's partial order, there are two paths: LB and tau, both leading to DP.

So, the XOR_node's order would have:

XOR_node.order.add_edge(LB, DP)
XOR_node.order.add_edge(tau, DP)

But wait, in the root's order, the nodes are the activities and the loop nodes, not the individual activities within the XOR_node's children. So, perhaps the XOR_node is a node in the root's order, and its children are the LB and tau activities.

Wait, no. The XOR_node is an OperatorPOWL, which has children that are POWL models. So, the children of XOR_node are the LB activity and the tau activity.

So, in the root's order, after PK comes XOR_node, and after XOR_node comes DP.

But within the XOR_node, there's a choice between LB and tau. So, the order within XOR_node would have LB and tau, with both leading to DP.

So, the order within XOR_node is:

XOR_node.order.add_edge(LB, DP)
XOR_node.order.add_edge(tau, DP)

Thus, in the root's order, the sequence is:

... PK --> XOR_node --> DP --> D ...

And within XOR_node, there's a choice between LB and tau, both leading to DP.

Now, putting this all together, the final POWL model would have:

- A root StrictPartialOrder containing all the nodes.

- The order relations enforcing the sequence from OR to D, with loops and XOR as described.

- The loop nodes Loop1 and Loop2 representing the loops between AS-IQC and TST-RT.

- The XOR node representing the choice between LB and tau after PK.

I think this covers all the necessary steps and structures based on the event logs provided.
</think>

To model the given event log as a POWL structure, we need to capture the sequence of activities, the optional steps, and the loops involved in the manufacturing process. Here's the final POWL model:

### POWL Model Structure

1. **Root StrictPartialOrder**:
   - **Nodes**: OR, MS, QS, AS, IQC, Loop1 (exit), TST, Loop2 (exit), PK, XOR_node, DP, D.
   - **Order Relations**:
     - OR  MS  QS  AS  IQC  Loop1.exit  TST  Loop2.exit  PK  XOR_node  DP  D.

2. **Loop Structures**:
   - **Loop1**: Represents the loop between AS and IQC.
     - Structure: `* (AS, IQC)`
     - This loop allows for repeated execution of AS followed by IQC until the loop is exited.
   - **Loop2**: Represents the loop between TST and RT.
     - Structure: `* (TST, RT)`
     - This loop allows for repeated execution of TST followed by RT until the loop is exited.

3. **Choice Structure (XOR)**:
   - **XOR_node**: Represents the exclusive choice between performing LB or skipping it (silent transition).
     - Structure: `X (LB, tau)`
     - After PK, the process chooses between executing LB or proceeding directly to DP.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Start**: The process begins with the receipt of an Order (OR).
- **Sequence**: OR is followed by Material Sourcing (MS), then Quality Screening (QS), leading to Assembly (AS).
- **Loop1**: After AS, there's an In-line Quality Check (IQC). If necessary, the process can loop back to AS and IQC again.
- **Testing Loop**: After IQC, the process moves to Testing (TST). If the test fails, Re-Testing (RT) is performed, looping back to TST until the test passes.
- **Packaging and Distribution**: After the testing loop, the product is packaged (PK). There's an optional step of Labeling (LB) which can be skipped, modeled as an XOR choice.
- **Final Steps**: After the optional LB, the process proceeds to Distribution Planning (DP) and finally Dispatch (D).

### Final POWL Model Code Representation

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")

# Define loops
loop_AS_IQC = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])
loop_TST_RT = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Define the XOR choice between LB and silent transition
tau = SilentTransition()
xor_LB_tau = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, tau])

# Create the root StrictPartialOrder
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    OR, MS, QS, AS, IQC, loop_AS_IQC, TST, loop_TST_RT, PK, xor_LB_tau, DP, D
])

# Add order relations
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, AS)
root.order.add_edge(AS, IQC)
root.order.add_edge(IQC, loop_AS_IQC)  # loop_AS_IQC is the exit point of the loop
root.order.add_edge(loop_AS_IQC, TST)
root.order.add_edge(TST, loop_TST_RT)  # loop_TST_RT is the exit point of the loop
root.order.add_edge(loop_TST_RT, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, xor_LB_tau)
root.order.add_edge(xor_LB_tau, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)

# Define the order within the XOR choice
xor_LB_tau.order.add_edge(LB, DP)
xor_LB_tau.order.add_edge(tau, DP)
```

This model accurately captures the process flow, including the loops for quality checks and testing, and the optional labeling step, ensuring that all possible execution paths are represented correctly.
