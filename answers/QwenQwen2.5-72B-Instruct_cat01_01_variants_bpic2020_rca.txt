To identify the root causes of performance issues in the process, we need to analyze the data provided, focusing on the frequency and performance of each process variant. Here are the key points:

### 1. **High Frequency Variants with Suboptimal Performance:**
- **Variant 1:**
  - **Frequency:** 4618
  - **Performance:** 810187.903
  - **Path:** Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
  - **Analysis:** This is the most frequent variant, but the performance is not the best. It suggests that while the process is common, there might be inefficiencies in the approval steps or payment handling.

- **Variant 2:**
  - **Frequency:** 2473
  - **Performance:** 1084338.407
  - **Path:** Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
  - **Analysis:** This variant is less frequent but has worse performance compared to Variant 1. The additional step of approval by the BUDGET OWNER seems to introduce significant delays.

- **Variant 3:**
  - **Frequency:** 1392
  - **Performance:** 854633.975
  - **Path:** Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
  - **Analysis:** This variant has a shorter path and slightly better performance compared to Variant 1. The absence of the ADMINISTRATION approval step might be a factor in better performance.

- **Variant 4:**
  - **Frequency:** 575
  - **Performance:** 861058.409
  - **Path:** Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
  - **Analysis:** This variant has a similar performance to Variant 3 but with an additional PRE_APPROVER step. The PRE_APPROVER step does not significantly impact performance, but it might still be a bottleneck in some cases.

### 2. **Low Frequency Variants with High Performance Issues:**
- **Variant 14:**
  - **Frequency:** 14
  - **Performance:** 1005677.500
  - **Path:** Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
  - **Analysis:** This variant is less frequent but has a higher performance issue. The combination of ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER approvals seems to introduce significant delays.

- **Variant 16:**
  - **Frequency:** 6
  - **Performance:** 2936133.833
  - **Path:** Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
  - **Analysis:** This variant has a very high performance issue, likely due to the multiple rejections and resubmissions. The approval and rejection steps appear to be particularly problematic.

- **Variant 23:**
  - **Frequency:** 4
  - **Performance:** 3502608.250
  - **Path:** Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
  - **Analysis:** This variant has the most rejections and resubmissions, leading to extremely high performance issues. The repeated rejections by ADMINISTRATION are a major bottleneck.

### 3. **Rejection and Resubmission Patterns:**
- **Variants with Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions:**
  - **Variant 5, 6, 14, 16, 23:**
  - **Analysis:** These variants show that multiple rejections and resubmissions significantly impact performance. The root causes could be:
    - Inconsistent or unclear criteria for approvals.
    - Communication gaps between employees and approvers.
    - Complex or redundant approval steps that could be streamlined.

### 4. **Single Rejection Variants:**
- **Variants 21, 28:**
  - **Analysis:** Single rejections and resubmissions also contribute to performance issues, but to a lesser extent than multiple rejections. The root causes could be:
    - Incorrect or incomplete initial submissions.
    - Lack of feedback to employees on why their declarations were rejected.

### 5. **Approval Steps:**
- **Variants with ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER Approvals:**
  - **Analysis:** Variants that include ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER approvals tend to have higher performance issues. The root causes could be:
    - Delays in the approval process due to high workload.
    - Complex or lengthy review processes that could be optimized.

### 6. **PRE_APPROVER Step:**
- **Variants with PRE_APPROVER:**
  - **Analysis:** The PRE_APPROVER step does not significantly impact performance in the more frequent variants but might be a bottleneck in less frequent ones. The root causes could be:
    - Inconsistent or variable performance by PRE_APPROVERS.
    - Lack of standardized processes for pre-approval.

### Summary of Root Causes:
1. **Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions:**
   - Inconsistent or unclear criteria for approvals.
   - Communication gaps between employees and approvers.
   - Complex or redundant approval steps.

2. **Inefficient Approval Steps:**
   - Delays in the ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER approval processes.
   - Complex or lengthy review processes.

3. **PRE_APPROVER Bottlenecks:**
   - Inconsistent or variable performance by PRE_APPROVERS.
   - Lack of standardized processes for pre-approval.

4. **Single Rejection Variants:**
   - Incorrect or incomplete initial submissions.
   - Lack of feedback to employees on rejection reasons.

By addressing these specific issues, the overall performance of the process can be significantly improved.
