To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze the process variants and their execution times. Here are the key observations and differences:

### 1. **Process Complexity and Frequency:**
   - **Protected Group:** The process variants for the protected group are more diverse and often involve more steps, including additional examinations (e.g., "Expert Examination," "Thorough Examination") and more frequent re-diagnoses and re-treatments. The protected group also has a higher frequency of processes that end in "Treatment unsuccessful," requiring additional steps like re-diagnosis and re-treatment.
   - **Unprotected Group:** The process variants for the unprotected group are more streamlined and less complex. They tend to have fewer steps and are more likely to follow a direct path to successful treatment and discharge. The unprotected group has a higher frequency of processes that end in "Treatment successful" without additional steps.

### 2. **Execution Time (Performance):**
   - **Protected Group:** The execution times for the protected group are generally longer, especially for processes that involve multiple examinations, re-diagnoses, and re-treatments. This suggests that the protected group spends more time in the system, possibly due to more complex cases or delays in treatment.
   - **Unprotected Group:** The execution times for the unprotected group are generally shorter, indicating a more efficient and streamlined process. The unprotected group tends to have faster processing times, even for complex processes involving multiple examinations and treatments.

### 3. **Process Variants Involving "Treatment Unsuccessful":**
   - **Protected Group:** The protected group has a higher frequency of processes that involve "Treatment unsuccessful," requiring additional steps like re-diagnosis and re-treatment. This suggests that the protected group may be more likely to experience treatment failures or complications.
   - **Unprotected Group:** The unprotected group has fewer instances of "Treatment unsuccessful" and more instances of "Treatment successful" on the first attempt.

### 4. **Registration Points:**
   - **Protected Group:** The protected group has a higher frequency of registrations at both "ER" and "FD," suggesting that they may be accessing the system through different entry points, which could lead to variability in treatment processes.
   - **Unprotected Group:** The unprotected group has a higher frequency of registrations at "FD" and fewer at "ER," indicating a more consistent entry point and potentially a more standardized treatment process.

### 5. **Discharge Process:**
   - **Protected Group:** The discharge process for the protected group is more varied and often involves additional steps, such as re-diagnosis and re-treatment, before discharge.
   - **Unprotected Group:** The discharge process for the unprotected group is more straightforward and consistent, with fewer additional steps.

### Conclusion:
The main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups are in the complexity, frequency, and execution time of the process variants. The protected group experiences more complex and time-consuming processes, with a higher likelihood of treatment failures and additional steps. In contrast, the unprotected group experiences more streamlined, efficient, and successful processes with shorter execution times.

These differences may indicate unfair treatment of the protected group, potentially due to systemic biases or other factors that lead to more complicated and time-consuming processes for this group. Further investigation is needed to determine the root causes of these disparities and to address any unfair treatment.
