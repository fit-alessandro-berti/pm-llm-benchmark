Based on the directly follows graph provided, it seems to describe a supply chain and logistics process involved in moving goods (containers) from one location to another, specifically from a supplier to a terminal or a customer, using Trucks and Vehicles for transportation. The process revolves around managing orders, dispatching trucks, loading containers, and ensuring on-time delivery. Here's a general breakdown of the process steps highlighted by the event and object types:

1. **Customer Order Management**: The process starts with managing customer orders (`Register Customer Order`, `Create Transport Document`), which include coordinating the creation of transport documents based on the specific order details.

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - After orders are lodged (`Create Transport Document`), the next step includes booking vehicles (`Book Vehicles`) that will be used to transport the goods.
   - Containers need to be ordered or picked up from storage (or the supplier) when required (`Order Empty Containers`, `Pick Up Empty Container`).

3. **Preparation**:
   - After a transport document is created, vehicles are booked (`Book Vehicles`).
   - Containers are then collected (`Collect Goods`) and loaded onto Trucks.
   - Before the goods leave, they are weighed (`Weigh`) to ensure the correct amount is loaded (`Place in Stock` on the truck).

4. **Transport**:
   - Once loaded (`Load Truck`), containers are delivered to their final destination using trucks (`Drive to Terminal`).
   - Trucks then travel to a terminal (`Drive to Terminal`) and unload the goods (`Load to Vehicle`), which is possibly another part of a longer transportation process.

5. **Monitoring and Control**:
   - During transportation, containers are monitored and steps may be taken to reschedule if necessary (`Reschedule Container`).
   - Once at the destination (`Book Vehicles`, `Depart`), processes ensure that the containers are handled efficiently.

6. **Post-Delivery**:
   - After goods are dropped off (`Depart`), warehouses or customer facilities take over with additional steps such as weighing (`Weigh`), placing in the stock area (`Place in Stock` or `Drive to Terminal`), and final loading (`Unload`).

The detailed durations and frequencies of each step validate the assumption that this is a complex, multi-faceted logistical supply chain process that involves multiple rounds of order processing, resource booking, preparation, delivery, and monitoring. This data also suggests there might be reorganization steps (like rescheduling containers and vehicles) that ensure smooth transportation.
