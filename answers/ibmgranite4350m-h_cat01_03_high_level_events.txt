### Proposed High-Level Activities

Based on the provided event log and analysis, here are the proposed high-level activities that represent logical groupings of the lower-level events:

1. **Material Preparation**  
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet  
   - Scan barcode  

2. **Quality Assurance Check**  
   - Measure weld integrity  

### Rationale for Grouping

- The first activity is categorized under "Material Preparation" because it involves retrieving a material that needs to be prepared.
- The second activity, being within the same phase of preparing components (i.e., part preparation), was grouped with another quality assurance check since they both are directly related to validating or assessing materials.
- There is no logical progression from these activities to an "Assembly" step; rather, each leads up a series of actions intended for assembling parts. The reasoning behind grouping them together stems from their sequential nature and the purposeful placement within material preparation.

### Names for High-Level Activities

- **Material Preparation**
- **Quality Assurance Check**

### Structured Representation

```json
{
  "highLevelActivities": [
    {
      "name": "Material Preparation",
      "description": "Retrieve raw metal sheet"
    },
    {
      "name": "Quality Assurance Check",
      "description": "Measure weld integrity"
    }
  ]
}
```

This structured output clearly defines the grouping and rationale of high-level activities within the manufacturing process, making it easier to understand how these granular events are transformed into coherent stages.
