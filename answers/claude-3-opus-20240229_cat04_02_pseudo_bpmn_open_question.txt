Here are some ideas for optimizing the process described in the pseudo-BPMN to reduce turnaround times, increase flexibility for non-standard requests, and leverage automation and analytics:

Automation Opportunities:
- Automate the initial request intake and routing (Task A) using intelligent forms/RPA to categorize requests as standard or custom and initiate the appropriate path.  
- Automate the standard validation checks (Tasks C1/C2) by integrating with credit check and inventory systems. Set up business rules to auto-approve if criteria are met.
- For custom requests, use a rules engine/expert system to auto-assess initial feasibility (Gateway after Task B2) based on predefined criteria. Route clearly infeasible requests straight to rejection.
- Auto-generate standard quotations and invoices (Tasks D and G) from templates based on business rules. Only involve humans for exceptions.

Resource Allocation:
- Create separate resource pools for standard vs custom requests with cross-training to dynamically reallocate based on demand.
- Implement skill-based routing to assign custom feasibility (Task B2) and custom quotation (Task E1) to most qualified available resources.
- Provide managers a queue/portal to rapidly review and approve requests (Task F) on their own schedule. Escalate if SLAs are missed.

Proactive Analytics:
- Analyze request patterns to identify common types of customizations. Develop templates and new "semi-custom" workflows for faster turnaround.
- Predictive model to score each request's likelihood of being non-standard. Auto-route high scoring requests to custom path (new Gateway after Task A).
- Analyze delivery date accuracy, approval rates, profitability of custom requests to optimize business rules and approval criteria over time.

Other Process Changes:
- Allow some custom requests to proceed at risk before final manager approval. Initiate procurement, scheduling in parallel to compress timeline. Cancel later if not approved.
- Develop expedited workflow for small customizations (artwork, finish) that don't require full feasibility analysis. 
- Set customer expectations upfront with realistic timelines based on request type. Send proactive updates if expedited or at risk of delay.
- Solicit customer feedback on custom requests to identify issues and improvement opportunities. Feed learnings back into process.

These changes would front-load more of the analysis and allow straight-through processing of a higher percentage of requests. Automated business rules handle routine work while human expertise is focused where most needed. Analytics enable continuous improvement over time. 

However, the trade-offs are higher initial investment for automation and potential added complexity from maintaining multiple workflows. Allowing some work to proceed at risk could lead to waste if requests are later rejected. Governance becomes critical to tune models and adapt to changing business conditions.

In summary, the proposed approach leverages both technology and targeted human expertise to increase speed for standard requests and flexibility for custom ones. The goal is an intelligent, data-driven process that gets better over time, but planners must carefully balance the benefits of sophistication against the costs of complexity. An iterative approach to roll out improvements, with clear metrics and feedback loops, is likely the prudent path forward.
