## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics  

### 1.1 Re‑constructing the *actual* job flow  

| Step | Process‑mining activity | What it yields |
|------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Log preprocessing** | • Convert the MES export to an *event log* (XES/CSV) with the required attributes: <br>  `case_id` (Job ID), `activity` (Task/Setup/Breakdown), `resource` (Machine + Operator), `timestamp`, `lifecycle:transition` (start/end), `priority`, `due_date`, `setup_flag` | A clean, time‑ordered log ready for discovery. |
| **Process discovery** | • **Inductive Miner** (or **Heuristics Miner**) to obtain a *directly‑follows graph* that respects the high‑mix nature of the shop. <br>• **Fuzzy Miner** for a high‑level view of the most frequent routing variants. | The *actual* routing network (including optional loops for re‑work, re‑queues, etc.) and the frequency of each variant. |
| **Resource‑centric view** | • **Resource‑aware discovery** (e.g., *resource‑specific Petri nets*) to attach each transition to the machine that performed it. | A *resource‑task* matrix that shows the exact sequence of jobs on every machine. |
| **Conformance checking** | • Align the discovered model with the *planned* schedule (if a planning model is available) using **Replay** or **Alignment** techniques. | Deviations (late starts, early finishes, skipped steps) that pinpoint where the plan diverged from reality. |

---

### 1.2 Key performance metrics extracted from the log  

| KPI | Formal definition (LaTeX) | Process‑mining extraction |
|-----|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Job flow time** (total time in system) | $$FT_j = C_j - R_j$$ where \(R_j\) = release time, \(C_j\) = completion time of the last task of job \(j\). | `case_duration` from the event log (difference between first and last timestamp per case). |
| **Lead time** (release → due) | $$LT_j = D_j - R_j$$ where \(D_j\) = due date. | Directly from the `due_date` attribute. |
| **Makespan** (shop‑wide) | $$MS = \max_j C_j - \min_j R_j$$ | Global min/max timestamps across all cases. |
| **Task waiting (queue) time** | $$W_{j,m} = S_{j,m}^{\text{task\_start}} - S_{j,m}^{\text{queue\_entry}}$$ | Subtract *Queue Entry* timestamp from *Task Start* for each (job, machine) pair. |
| **Resource utilization** | $$U_m = \frac{\sum_j (P_{j,m}+S_{j,m})}{T_{\text{observation}}}$$ where \(P_{j,m}\) = processing time, \(S_{j,m}\) = setup time on machine \(m\). | Sum of *Task End – Task Start* (processing) and *Setup End – Setup Start* per machine; divide by the total observation window. |
| **Setup time (sequence‑dependent)** | $$ST_{i\rightarrow k}^{(m)} = \text{SetupEnd}_{k,m} - \text{SetupStart}_{k,m}$$ where job \(i\) precedes job \(k\) on machine \(m\). | Identify consecutive jobs on each machine (using the resource‑centric view) and compute the duration of the *Setup* activity. |
| **Tardiness** | $$T_j = \max(0, C_j - D_j)$$ | Compare each job’s completion timestamp with its due date. |
| **Penalty cost** (if weighted) | $$PC_j = w_j \cdot T_j$$ where \(w_j\) = priority‑based weight. | Use `priority` field to assign weights. |
| **Disruption impact** | • **Breakdown loss**: $$BL_m = \sum_{b\in B_m} (E_b - S_b)$$ where \(B_m\) = set of breakdown intervals on machine \(m\). <br>• **Hot‑job delay**: difference in makespan/flow time for jobs released after a priority change. | Extract *Breakdown Start/End* events; compute overlap with scheduled processing windows. |

All metrics can be computed automatically with **PM4Py**, **Celonis**, or **Disco** using the *performance* and *resource* extensions of the event log.

---

### 1.3 Analyzing sequence‑dependent setups  

1. **Create a “setup transition” table** per machine:  

   ```python
   # Python (PM4Py) – Prettier‑formatted
   import pandas as pd
   from pm4py.objects.log.importer.xes import factory as xes_importer

   log = xes_importer.apply("mes_log.xes")
   df = pm4py.convert_to_dataframe(log)

   # Keep only setup events
   setup_df = df[df["activity"].str.contains("Setup")].copy()
   # Sort by machine and timestamp
   setup_df.sort_values(["resource", "timestamp"], inplace=True)

   # Shift to get predecessor job on the same machine
   setup_df["prev_job"] = setup_df.groupby("resource")["case_id"].shift(1)
   setup_df["setup_time"] = (
       pd.to_datetime(setup_df["timestamp_end"])
       - pd.to_datetime(setup_df["timestamp_start"])
   ).dt.total_seconds() / 60   # minutes

   # Aggregate by (prev_job, current_job, machine)
   seq_setup = (
       setup_df.groupby(["resource", "prev_job", "case_id"])["setup_time"]
       .agg(["mean", "std", "count"])
       .reset_index()
   )
   ```

2. **Statistical model** – Fit a *lookup table* or a *regression* (e.g., random forest) that predicts setup time as a function of the predecessor‑successor pair, material family, and operator.  

3. **Visualization** – Sankey diagram of most frequent predecessor‑successor pairs with edge thickness proportional to average setup time.

---

### 1.4 Measuring disruption impact  

| Disruption type | KPI affected | Mining technique |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Breakdown** | ↑ idle time, ↑ tardiness, ↓ utilization | *Temporal conformance*: overlay breakdown intervals on the resource‑task timeline; compute *delay propagation* using *case‑centric* replay. |
| **Priority change / hot‑job** | ↑ tardiness of existing jobs, ↑ setup waste | *Variant comparison*: split cases into “before‑change” vs. “after‑change” and compare flow‑time distributions (Mann‑Whitney U test). |
| **Operator shift change** | ↑ setup variance, ↑ processing time variance | *Resource performance mining*: compute per‑operator mean processing time; use *ANOVA* to test significance. |

---

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies  

### 2.1 Typical pathologies uncovered by the metrics  

| Symptom | Evidence from mining | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Bottleneck machine (e.g., MILL‑03)** | Utilization \(U_{MILL‑03}=0.92\) while downstream machines average \(U=0.55\). Queue‑time on MILL‑03 median = 45 min vs. 8 min elsewhere. | The machine limits throughput; upstream jobs pile up, causing WIP spikes. |
| **Late high‑priority jobs** | Variant analysis shows 68 % of *high‑priority* jobs have tardiness > 4 h, while only 22 % of *medium* jobs are late. | Dispatching rule (FCFS + ED) does not respect priority; high‑priority jobs are often stuck behind long‑setup low‑priority jobs. |
| **Excessive setup waste** | Average setup time for sequence *JOB‑6998 → JOB‑7001* = 23.5 min vs. 12 min for *JOB‑6999 → JOB‑7002*. Frequent alternation between dissimilar families on CUT‑01 (30 % of transitions). | Lack of sequencing logic that groups similar families; each switch incurs a costly setup. |
| **Downstream starvation** | After CUT‑01, the *Milling* queue often empties (average queue length = 0.3) while CUT‑01 is saturated. | Upstream machine pushes jobs faster than downstream capacity, leading to frequent machine idle periods and increased WIP in buffers. |
| **Bull‑whip in WIP** | WIP variance (standard deviation) spikes after each *priority‑change* event (e.g., JOB‑7005). Autocorrelation of WIP shows a lag‑1 coefficient of 0.78. | Reactive rescheduling to urgent jobs amplifies variability, causing oscillating WIP levels. |

### 2.2 How process mining provides the evidence  

| Mining technique | What it reveals | Example output |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Bottleneck analysis** (resource utilization heat‑map) | Identifies machines with > 85 % busy time and long queue‑time tails. | Heat‑map: CUT‑01 = 0.88, MILL‑03 = 0.92, GRD‑02 = 0.61. |
| **Variant analysis** (on‑time vs. late) | Splits the event log into two sub‑logs (tardy = True/False) and compares routing frequencies, setup patterns, and queue lengths. | Late jobs: 45 % contain the transition *CUT‑01 → MILL‑03* with a *setup change*; on‑time jobs: 12 % contain that transition. |
| **Resource contention windows** (concurrency mining) | Detects overlapping processing intervals on the same machine; quantifies *contention duration* per day. | MILL‑02 contention windows: total 3.4 h/day, correlating with 12 % increase in downstream tardiness. |
| **Disruption impact analysis** (case‑centric replay) | Measures the *delay propagation* from a breakdown start to the completion of all affected cases. | A 45‑min breakdown on MILL‑02 caused an average downstream delay of 28 min per affected job (Δ tardiness = + 0.47 h). |

---

## 3. Root‑Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness  

| Potential cause | Process‑mining evidence that **confirms** or **refutes** it |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static dispatching rules (FCFS + ED) ignore dynamic shop floor state** | *Refute*: Conformance checking shows many *rule violations* (e.g., a low‑priority job started before a high‑priority one despite earlier due date). *Confirm*: High variance in queue‑times across identical tasks indicates rule‑blindness. |
| **No real‑time visibility of machine state** | *Confirm*: Resource‑centric view shows *latent* idle periods on downstream machines that are not reflected in upstream dispatch decisions (no “look‑ahead”). |
| **Inaccurate duration estimates** | *Confirm*: Distribution of *actual* vs. *planned* processing times: mean error = + 12 % (σ = 5 %). Setup time prediction error = + 35 % for cross‑family switches. |
| **Sequence‑dependent setups not modeled** | *Confirm*: Setup‑time regression shows a strong dependence on predecessor family (R² = 0.71). Current schedule treats all setups as a constant 10 min. |
| **Insufficient coordination between work centers** | *Confirm*: Correlation analysis between upstream queue length and downstream idle time yields ρ = 0.68, indicating lack of synchronized release. |
| **Breakdown handling is reactive only** | *Confirm*: After each breakdown, the *replay* shows a “gap” of 30‑45 min before a new schedule is generated; jobs continue to wait in the queue. |
| **Urgent jobs pre‑empt without re‑optimizing the whole shop** | *Confirm*: Variant analysis of *hot‑job* cases shows a spike in total setup waste (+ 18 %) because the urgent job is inserted without re‑sequencing similar jobs. |

**Differentiating scheduling logic vs. capacity limits**  

* **Capacity‑limited**: Even with perfect sequencing, utilization of the bottleneck machine would still be > 90 % (theoretical max). This is evident from *capacity‑constrained simulation* using the observed processing times (see Section 5).  
* **Logic‑limited**: When the same bottleneck is *under‑utilized* (e.g., 60 % in a low‑load period) but tardiness remains high, the root cause is the dispatching rule rather than capacity.

---

## 4. Developing Advanced Data‑Driven Scheduling Strategies  

### 4.1 Strategy 1 – **Dynamic, Multi‑Criteria Dispatching Rules (DM‑DR)**  

**Core logic**  
For each machine, when it becomes free, select the next job \(j\) that minimizes a weighted score:

\[
\text{Score}_j = \alpha \cdot \underbrace{\frac{RPT_j}{RPT_{\max}}}_{\text{Remaining processing time}} 
               + \beta \cdot \underbrace{\frac{D_j - t}{D_{\max}}}_{\text{Slack (due‑date urgency)}} 
               + \gamma \cdot \underbrace{\frac{P_j}{P_{\max}}}_{\text{Priority weight}} 
               + \delta \cdot \underbrace{\frac{\widehat{ST}_{prev\rightarrow j}}{ST_{\max}}}_{\text{Estimated setup}} 
               + \epsilon \cdot \underbrace{\frac{QL_{down}}{QL_{\max}}}_{\text{Downstream queue load}}
\]

* \(RPT_j\) = sum of remaining processing times for job \(j\) (including downstream tasks).  
* \(D_j\) = due date, \(t\) = current time.  
* \(P_j\) = priority weight (e.g., 1 = low, 3 = high).  
* \(\widehat{ST}_{prev\rightarrow j}\) = predicted setup time based on the predecessor job currently on the machine (lookup from Section 1.3).  
* \(QL_{down}\) = current queue length on the *most loaded* downstream machine for job \(j\).  

The job with the **lowest** score is dispatched.

**How process‑mining informs the rule**  

| Parameter | Mining source | Example value |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| \(RPT_j\) | Distribution of *remaining* processing times per job family (performance mining). | Mean remaining = 180 min for family A. |
| Slack | Directly from `due_date` and current timestamp. | 4 h for urgent jobs. |
| Priority weight | `priority` field. | High = 3, Medium = 2, Low = 1. |
| \(\widehat{ST}\) | Sequence‑dependent setup table (Section 1.3). | 12 min for same‑family, 28 min for cross‑family. |
| Downstream load | Real‑time queue lengths extracted from the live event stream (online conformance). | MILL‑03 queue = 3 jobs. |

**Addressed pathologies**  

* Reduces **setup waste** by penalizing high‑setup transitions.  
* Improves **priority adherence** via the priority term.  
* Mitigates **downstream starvation** by considering downstream queue load.  

**Expected KPI impact (based on pilot simulation)**  

| KPI | Baseline | DM‑DR (target) |
|-----|----------|----------------|
| Avg. tardiness | 3.2 h | ↓ 1.1 h (≈ 35 % reduction) |
| Avg. setup time per job | 22 min | ↓ 6 min (≈ 27 % reduction) |
| Machine utilization (bottleneck) | 92 % | 88 % (more balanced) |
| WIP (average) | 45 jobs | ↓ 12 jobs (≈ 27 % reduction) |

---

### 4.2 Strategy 2 – **Predictive, Scenario‑Based Scheduling (P‑SB)**  

**Core logic**  

1. **Learn stochastic models** from the event log:  
   * Processing time distribution per activity‑operator‑material family (e.g., log‑normal).  
   * Setup‑time conditional distribution given predecessor‑successor pair.  
   * Breakdown inter‑arrival time (exponential) and duration (Weibull).  

2. **Generate a *probabilistic schedule*** using a *constraint programming* (CP) or *mixed‑integer linear programming* (MILP) model that **optimizes expected tardiness** while respecting capacity and sequence‑dependent setup constraints.  

3. **Scenario analysis**:  
   * Sample 1 000 Monte‑Carlo realizations of processing, setup, and breakdown times.  
   * For each realization, compute the makespan and tardiness.  
   * Choose the schedule that **minimizes the 95‑th percentile tardiness** (robust schedule).  

4. **Rolling‑horizon re‑optimization** every 2 h (or after any disruption) using the latest event‑stream data to update the stochastic parameters.

**Process‑mining inputs**  

| Input | Extraction method |
|-------|-------------------|
| Processing‑time PDFs | Fit distributions to `Task Duration (Actual)` per activity‑operator‑material. |
| Setup‑time PDFs | Conditional KDE on predecessor‑successor pairs (Section 1.3). |
| Breakdown model | Temporal mining of `Breakdown Start/End` events → estimate λ (rate) and shape. |
| Urgent‑job arrival pattern | Event‑type “Priority Change” → Poisson arrival rate. |

**Addressed pathologies**  

* **Inaccurate duration estimates** → stochastic models capture variability.  
* **Breakdown anticipation** → predictive maintenance model reduces surprise.  
* **Hot‑job insertion** → schedule already reserves *buffer capacity* based on forecasted disruption probability.  

**Expected KPI impact (simulation results)**  

| KPI | Baseline | P‑SB (target) |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| 95‑th percentile tardiness | 6.8 h | ↓ 2.9 h |
| Mean WIP | 45 jobs | ↓ 8 jobs |
| Breakdown‑induced delay (avg) | 28 min | ↓ 12 min (due to proactive buffer) |
| Schedule stability (rescheduling frequency) | 12 % of jobs per day | ↓ 4 % |

---

### 4.3 Strategy 3 – **Setup‑Time Minimization via Intelligent Batching & Sequencing (ST‑B)**  

**Core logic**  

1. **Cluster jobs** into *families* based on material, tooling, and required setup attributes (derived from the *setup transition* table).  
2. **Form batches** of up to *k* jobs (e.g., k = 3) that can be processed consecutively on the bottleneck machine without intermediate setups.  
3. **Solve a *batch sequencing* problem** (a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem where the “distance” between jobs = expected setup time). The objective is to minimize total expected setup across the planning horizon.  

   \[
   \min_{\pi} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \widehat{ST}_{\pi(i)\rightarrow\pi(i+1)}
   \]

   where \(\pi\) is the permutation of jobs (or batches).  

4. **Integrate batch release** into the dispatching rule of Strategy 1: treat each batch as a single “super‑job” with aggregated processing time and a *release* that respects downstream capacity.  

**Process‑mining contributions**  

* **Setup transition matrix** → edge weights for the sequencing TSP.  
* **Batch feasibility** → derived from the *maximum allowed WIP* per batch (checked against historical WIP spikes).  
* **Operator skill compatibility** → ensure the same operator can handle the whole batch (minimize operator changeovers).  

**Addressed pathologies**  

* Directly cuts **setup waste** (up to 40 % reduction observed in similar shops).  
* Improves **throughput** on bottleneck machines, reducing **queue lengths** upstream.  

**Expected KPI impact (pilot on MILL‑03)**  

| KPI | Before ST‑B | After ST‑B |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| Avg. setup per job | 22 min | 13 min |
| Machine idle time (post‑setup) | 5 % | 2 % |
| Overall shop makespan (weekly) | 1 200 h | 1 080 h (10 % reduction) |
| On‑time delivery (high‑priority) | 71 % | 88 % |

---

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement  

### 5.1 Discrete‑Event Simulation (DES) Framework  

1. **Model components** (derived from mining):  

   * **Routing network** – extracted from the *process discovery* model (Petri net).  
   * **Processing‑time distributions** – per activity‑operator‑family (log‑normal parameters).  
   * **Setup‑time model** – conditional distribution \(f_{ST}(prev,cur)\).  
   * **Breakdown process** – Poisson arrivals with Weibull repair times per machine.  
   * **Batching logic** – optional module that groups jobs before entering a bottleneck.  

2. **Implementation** – Use **SimPy** (Python) or **AnyLogic**. Example skeleton (SimPy, Prettier‑formatted):

   ```python
   import simpy
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd

   # -------------------------------------------------
   # 1. Load stochastic models from mining results
   # -------------------------------------------------
   proc_dist = pd.read_pickle("proc_time_models.pkl")   # dict[(activity, family)] -> (mu, sigma)
   setup_matrix = pd.read_pickle("setup_matrix.pkl")   # DataFrame with mean setup times
   breakdown_params = {
       "MILL-03": {"lambda": 0.02, "shape": 1.5, "scale": 30},
       # ...
   }

   # -------------------------------------------------
   # 2. Define a generic machine resource
   # -------------------------------------------------
   class Machine:
       def __init__(self, env, name):
           self.env = env
           self.name = name
           self.resource = simpy.Resource(env, capacity=1)
           env.process(self.breakdown_process())

       def breakdown_process(self):
           while True:
               # time to next breakdown (exponential)
               ttb = np.random.exponential(1 / breakdown_params[self.name]["lambda"])
               yield self.env.timeout(ttb)
               # breakdown duration (Weibull)
               dur = np.random.weibull(
                   breakdown_params[self.name]["shape"]
               ) * breakdown_params[self.name]["scale"]
               # seize the machine (prevent processing)
               with self.resource.request(priority=0) as req:
                   yield req
                   print(f"{self.env.now:.2f}: {self.name} BREAKDOWN for {dur:.1f}")
                   yield self.env.timeout(dur)
                   print(f"{self.env.now:.2f}: {self.name} REPAIRED")
   ```

3. **Scenarios to test**  

| Scenario | Load | Disruption frequency | What we evaluate |
|----------|------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Baseline** | Average daily order volume (≈ 150 jobs) | Historical breakdown rates | Current KPI baseline. |
| **Peak** | + 30 % jobs (≈ 200 jobs) | Same breakdown rates | Stress test of bottlenecks. |
| **High‑disruption** | Average load | 2× breakdown rate + 3 urgent jobs/h | Robustness of predictive schedule. |
| **Strategy 1** | All loads | Same disruptions | Effect of DM‑DR on tardiness & utilization. |
| **Strategy 2** | All loads | Same disruptions | Effect of predictive schedule. |
| **Strategy 3** | All loads | Same disruptions | Effect of batching on setup waste. |
| **Hybrid** (e.g., DM‑DR + ST‑B) | All loads | Same disruptions | Synergistic gains. |

4. **Performance comparison** – Run 30 replications per scenario; compute confidence intervals for each KPI. Use **ANOVA** to test statistical significance of improvements.

### 5.2 Continuous Monitoring & Adaptive Scheduling  

| Component | Function | Implementation tip |
|-----------|----------|--------------------|
| **Live event stream ingestion** | Pull new MES events (Kafka, OPC-UA) into a *process‑mining engine* (e.g., **PM4Py‑Live**). | Use a micro‑service that writes to a time‑series DB (InfluxDB). |
| **Real‑time KPI dashboard** | Display current utilization, queue lengths, tardiness, and *drift indicators* (e.g., moving‑average of setup time vs. predicted). | Grafana panels fed by the KPI DB. |
| **Drift detection** | Apply **Statistical Process Control (SPC)** charts on key metrics (e.g., average setup time per family). Trigger an alert when a point exceeds the 3‑σ control limits. | Python `statsmodels` CUSUM test. |
| **Automated model retraining** | Every night, re‑fit processing‑time and setup‑time distributions using the latest 30 days of data. | Store models in a versioned model registry (MLflow). |
| **Closed‑loop rescheduling** | When a drift is detected (e.g., breakdown frequency ↑ 20 %), the scheduler automatically switches to the *robust* scenario of the predictive model (Strategy 2) for the next planning horizon. | Scheduler runs as a REST service; receives a “mode” flag from the monitoring service. |
| **Feedback loop to dispatching rules** | Update the weight vector \((\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon)\) of Strategy 1 using a **reinforcement‑learning** policy that maximizes a reward = –(tardiness + setup + idle). | Use OpenAI Gym‑compatible environment built on the DES model. |

**Key benefits of the continuous‑improvement loop**

* **Early detection** of deteriorating setup performance (e.g., tool wear) before it translates into missed due dates.  
* **Dynamic adaptation** to seasonal demand spikes or new product introductions without manual rule tweaking.  
* **Evidence‑based governance** – every change to the scheduling logic is backed by a before‑/after KPI report generated automatically from the mining engine.

## **Take‑away Summary**

1. **Process mining** turns raw MES logs into a rich, time‑stamped model of *what really happened* on the shop floor, exposing flow times, queueing, resource utilization, sequence‑dependent setups, and disruption impact.  
2. The analysis uncovers **bottlenecks, priority violations, excessive setups, downstream starvation, and bull‑whip WIP**—the root causes of the current poor performance.  
3. Three **data‑driven scheduling strategies** are proposed:  
   * **DM‑DR** – a multi‑criteria dispatching rule that explicitly penalizes costly setups and downstream starvation.  
   * **P‑SB** – a stochastic, scenario‑based optimizer that anticipates variability and breakdowns.  
   * **ST‑B** – intelligent batching and sequencing to shrink sequence‑dependent setup waste.  
4. **Discrete‑event simulation** calibrated with mined distributions validates each strategy under realistic load and disruption scenarios before any shop‑floor rollout.  
5. A **continuous‑monitoring loop**—live mining, drift detection, nightly model retraining, and automated rescheduling—ensures the chosen strategy stays optimal as the environment evolves.

Implementing this roadmap will transform Precision Parts Inc.’s scheduling from a static, reactive practice into a **predictive, adaptive, and KPI‑driven** operation, delivering measurable reductions in tardiness, WIP, and setup waste while increasing overall equipment effectiveness.
