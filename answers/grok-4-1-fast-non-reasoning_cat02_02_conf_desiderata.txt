### 1. Normative Rule Violations

**Case 1:**  
No normative violations. The process follows the strict sequence perfectly:  
- Application Received (09:00)  Credit Check (09:30)  Risk Assessment (10:00)  Loan Decision (Approved, 11:00)  Inform Applicant (13:00)  Finalize Documentation (13:30)  Close Case (14:00).  
All ordering rules are satisfied, and actions align with the approved decision (documentation finalized before closing).

**Case 2:**  
Two clear normative violations:  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** Risk Assessment (08:20) occurs before Credit Check (09:00), violating the strict ordering rule that Credit Check *must* precede Risk Assessment. (Credit Check does occur later, but the sequence is irreversibly broken.)  
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** Loan Decision is Rejected (09:30), but Finalize Documentation (10:00) is performed before Close Case (10:30). This is explicitly not allowed for rejected loans.  
These are serious deviations from the normative process.

**Case 3:**  
No normative violations. The sequence is correct: Application Received (01-12 09:00)  Credit Check (01-14 10:00)  Risk Assessment (11:00)  Loan Decision (Approved, 12:00)  Inform Applicant (01-16 15:00)  Finalize Documentation (01-17 09:00)  Close Case (10:00). No steps are skipped, order is preserved, and approved decision logic is followed.

### 2. Desiderata Failures (Suboptimal but Not Severe)

Desiderata are recommended best practices (e.g., Credit Check within ~24 hours of application, Inform Applicant within ~48 hours of decision, optional Follow-up Call before closing). Violations here indicate suboptimal efficiency but do not breach strict rules.

**Case 1:**  
No desiderata failures. Credit Check is ~30 minutes after application (well within 24 hours). Inform Applicant is 2 hours after decision (well within 48 hours). Follow-up Call is absent but optional.

**Case 2:**  
No desiderata assessment possible due to normative violations overshadowing the process. Timing (e.g., Credit Check 40 min after application) is fine where applicable, but the case is invalid overall.

**Case 3:**  
Two desiderata failures, both timing-related (suboptimal delays):  
- **Delayed Credit Check:** Occurs ~49 hours after Application Received (01-12 09:00 to 01-14 10:00), exceeding the recommended ~24-hour window.  
- **Delayed Inform Applicant:** Occurs ~75 hours (~3 days) after Loan Decision (01-14 12:00 to 01-16 15:00), exceeding the recommended ~48-hour window.  
- **No Follow-up Call:** Absent (optional, so minor).  
These represent inefficiencies (e.g., prolonged processing) but are not serious violations.

### 3. Suggested Interpretations or Justifications

**Case 1:**  
Ideal compliance; no need for justification. Could represent a "best-case" scenario with streamlined operations.

**Case 2:**  
- **Early Risk Assessment:** Possible data processing error or parallel workflow mistake (e.g., Risk Assessment mistakenly triggered by incomplete automation before Credit Check results). The later Credit Check might indicate a corrective action, but it doesn't retroactively fix the sequence violation.  
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** Could be a clerical error (e.g., automated template applied incorrectly) or misunderstanding of rejection protocols, where staff prepared docs "just in case" before closing. No valid justification aligns with rules—these are clear errors.

**Case 3:**  
- **Timing Delays:** Justifiable by external factors like high workload, holidays/weekends (spans 01-12 to 01-17), or awaiting third-party credit bureau data (common for Credit Checks). Inform Applicant delay might stem from managerial approval chains. These fit "real-world" variability without breaking rules.  
- **No Follow-up Call:** Reasonable if the process was low-risk or applicant was unresponsive; it's optional and not pursued here, perhaps to prioritize closure. Overall, this case shows compliance under resource constraints.
