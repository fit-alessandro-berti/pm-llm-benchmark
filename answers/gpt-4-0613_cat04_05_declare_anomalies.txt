The process model seems to be generally well-formed according to the provided descriptions of the constraints. However, there are some potential issues that might depend on the specific business logic:

1. Overlapping Constraints: There seem to be some overlapping constraints. Very often, overlapping constraints lead to confusions or ambiguous decisions. For example, the precedence of 'Request Payment' -> 'Payment Handled', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' -> 'Request Payment' exist both as 'alternate precedence' and 'chain precedence'. This redundancy may need to be addressed. 

2. Unnecessary Constraints: Some constraints might be unnecessary given other constraints. For instance, if 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' is always followed by 'Request Payment' (as indicated by the chain/response/succession constraints), there is no need for an additional Responded Existence constraint between the two activities.

3. Cycle creation: According to the model, 'Request Payment' responds to 'Payment Handled' and vice-versa. This could create a cycle, which might not be a desirable property in some business processes.

4. Absence Constraints: There are several activities which are marked as "Absent", meaning that they do not take place during the process. This implies the process is highly streamlined and there are no variants or deviation possibilities. It's important to make sure whether these absences reflect actual business needs or are an oversimplification of the process.

5. Non co-existence, Non succession, and Non chain succession constraints are missing. If these constraints are required in your business process, the current model may have an issue.

It's recommended to confirm if these potential issues indeed pose problems in the context of the specific process modeled. Sometimes, what might appear to be an anomaly could actually be a requirement of the process.
