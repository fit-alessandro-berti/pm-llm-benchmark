1. Cases with significantly longer total resolution times  
• Case 101 – 08:00  10:15 ( 2 h 15 m)  
• Case 103 – 08:10  09:30 ( 1 h 20 m)

Average of “normal” cases (101 & 103)  1.8 hours

Outliers ( average)  
• Case 102 – 08:05 Mar 1  09:15 Mar 2 ( 25 h 10 m)  
• Case 104 – 08:20 Mar 1  08:30 Mar 2 ( 24 h 10 m)  
• Case 105 – 08:25 Mar 1  09:30 Mar 3 ( 49 h 5 m)  

2. Likely root-cause patterns behind the long cycle times  

a. Escalation to Level-2 (Cases 102 & 105)  
• Both escalations introduce a long “idle” period before the Level-2 investigation actually starts:  
– Case 102: Escalated 11:30  Investigation not until 14:00 (2 h 30 m wait).  
– Case 105: Escalated 10:00  Level-2 Investigation only at 14:00 next day ( 29 h wait).  
• After Level-2 investigation, another large gap precedes resolution ( 19 h in both cases), suggesting backlog or limited staffing on Level-2.

b. Late or paused Investigation without escalation (Case 104)  
• “Assign to L1” 09:30  Investigation starts 13:00 (3 h 30 m delay).  
• Investigation ends 13:00, yet ticket is not resolved until 08:00 next morning ( 19 h gap), pointing to deferred completion—possibly waiting on customer reply, parts, or an internal approval queue.

c. Slower early-stage handling (Case 104)  
• Receive 08:20  Triage only at 09:00 (40 m vs <15 m in fast cases). This pushes every downstream step later.

Summary of delay factors  
• Escalation queues / Level-2 backlog (Cases 102, 105)  
• Extended idle windows between “Assign-to-Agent” and “Investigate” (Cases 104, 105)  
• Long post-investigation waiting before “Resolve Ticket” (all slow cases)  
• Occasional slow triage (Case 104)

3. How these factors lengthen cycle time & recommendations  

Factor  Effect  Remedy  
a. Limited Level-2 capacity / unclear handover SLAs  
 Tickets sit in a queue for many hours or days.  
• Define a hard SLA for Level-2 acceptance (e.g., start investigation within 2 h of escalation).  
• Add Level-2 coverage during peak hours or cross-train senior L1 agents to absorb simple escalations.  
• Use escalation reason codes to spot avoidable escalations and coach L1 staff.

b. Idle time before starting investigation after assignment  
 Agent multitasking or ticket not prioritized.  
• Adopt “first-touch” KPI: investigation must begin within X minutes of assignment.  
• Implement workload-balancing in the assignment engine to avoid over-loading specific agents.

c. Delays between investigation completion and resolution  
 Waiting for approvals, customer responses, or documentation.  
• Introduce clearer “pending-on-customer” or “pending-approval” states so that internal responsibility is explicit.  
• Automate reminders and SLAs for approvers; escalate when exceeded.

d. Slow triage in a few cases  
 Bottlenecks right at the intake stage propagate downstream.  
• Review staffing for the triage desk during morning spikes.  
• Create simple auto-categorization rules for common issues to shorten triage.

Overall insight  
Fast cases follow the ideal path with no escalation and minimal idle gaps; slow cases exhibit two common traits—escalations that languish in a Level-2 queue, and prolonged “waiting” states (before or after investigation). Focusing on tighter SLAs, visible queue monitoring, and better workload balancing for escalations should reduce cycle time variance and lift overall performance.
