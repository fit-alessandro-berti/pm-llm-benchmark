Here is the Python code necessary to implement a POWL model for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process in pm4py:
```
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
create_purchase_order = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
approval = Transition(label="Approval")
create_invoice = Transition(label="Create Invoice")
payment = Transition(label="Payment")
send_goods = Transition(label="Send Goods")

# Define the XOR for approval (approved or rejected)
approved = Transition(label="Approved")
rejected = Transition(label="Rejected")
xor_approval = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[approved, rejected])

# Define the loop for payment ( payment can be done multiple times)
payment_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[payment, create_invoice])

# Define the partial order for the process
p2p_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[create_purchase_order, xor_approval, send_goods, payment_loop])

# Add the order between the activities
p2p_process.order.add_edge(create_purchase_order, xor_approval)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(approved, send_goods)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(approved, payment_loop)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(send_goods, payment_loop)

# The rejected transition is not connected to any other activity, it is considered a terminating activity
```
This POWL model represents a Purchase-to-Pay process where:

* A purchase order is created
* An approval is done (exclusive choice between approved or rejected)
* If approved, the goods are sent and the payment is done (loop for multiple payments)
* If rejected, the process terminates

Please note that this is just one possible representation of a Purchase-to-Pay process, and different companies may have different processes.
