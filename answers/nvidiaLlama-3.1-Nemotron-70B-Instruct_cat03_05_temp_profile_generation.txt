**Estimated Temporal Profile for Global Supply Chain Process**
===========================================================

Below is a Python dictionary representing a subset of the temporal profile for the described global supply chain process. This subset focuses on a mix of directly connected and non-directly connected activity pairs to illustrate the complexity of the process timeline. **Please note that the average times and standard deviations are estimates** and may vary based on actual process executions, supplier variability, and organizational efficiency.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 1800),  # ~2 hours avg, +/- 0.5 hours std dev (quick order placement after supplier selection)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),  # ~7 days avg, +/- 1 day std dev ( typical lead time for receiving components)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (28800, 7200),  # ~8 hours avg, +/- 2 hours std dev (inspection soon after component receipt)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 10800),  # ~12 hours avg, +/- 3 hours std dev (assembly begins after quality check)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (57600, 14400),  # ~16 hours avg, +/- 4 hours std dev (testing follows assembly closely)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (36000, 7200),  # ~10 hours avg, +/- 2 hours std dev (packaging after successful testing)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 1800),  # ~2 hours avg, +/- 0.5 hours std dev (quick storage after packaging)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 43200),  # ~3 days avg, +/- 0.5 days std dev (distribution after storage, considering logistical planning)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (1209600, 259200),  # ~14 days avg, +/- 3 days std dev (after-sales support begins after product distribution, allowing for initial customer interaction)

    # Non-directly connected pairs (showcasing variability across longer process spans)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (671040, 120960),  # ~7.8 days avg, +/- 1.4 days std dev (supplier selection to component receipt, aggregating lead times)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (645120, 100800),  # ~7.5 days avg, +/- 1.2 days std dev (order placement to quality inspection, combining lead time and initial process steps)
    ('CA', 'DT'): (446400, 86400),  # ~5.2 days avg, +/- 1 day std dev (component assembly to distribution, spanning testing, packaging, and storage)
    ('PT', 'AS'): (1346400, 259200),  # ~15.7 days avg, +/- 3 days std dev (product testing to after-sales support, covering packaging, storage, distribution, and initial post-sale period)
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Directly Connected Pairs:** Reflect shorter-term dependencies within the process (e.g., order placement immediately follows supplier selection, with an average delay of about 2 hours).
- **Non-Directly Connected Pairs:** Illustrate longer-term process dynamics, capturing variability across multiple steps (e.g., the time from order placement to quality inspection averages around 7.5 days, reflecting lead time plus initial processing).

**Note:** These estimates are hypothetical and based on general assumptions about supply chain and manufacturing processes. Actual times and variability can differ significantly based on factors like supplier reliability, production line efficiency, and logistical network capabilities.
