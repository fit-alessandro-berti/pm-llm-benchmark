**1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**

| Case ID | Timestamps (Observed)                     | Reason(s) of Violation |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 2       | Application Received (08:00), Credit Check (09:30), Risk Assessment (10:00), Loan Decision (Approved at 11:00). Inform Applicant (13:00), Finalize Documentation (at 14:00) – Close Case (15:00).                | **Violation of the “Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment” rule**. The credit check is performed after risk assessment, a direct sequence break. |
| 2       | Credit Check occurs at 09:30 but Loan Decision (Approved) is made only two hours later at 11:00 – thus informing the applicant immediately does not give sufficient time for documentation to be finalized before closing.      | **Violation of “Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision” rule**. The decision comes out first, so finalizing and then informing are in order; however, the case is closed without proper followup on paperwork (finalization). |
| 3       | Application Received at 09:00, Credit Check at 10:00 – **Note:** This exceeds a 24hour window after application receipt. Risk Assessment follows correctly at 11:00, but Loan Decision occurs only three days later (at 12:00), missing the recommended 48hour postdecision notification period for approval and far beyond any desideratum suggestion. Inform Applicant happens at 15:00 – more than a week after decision; finalizing documentation is done on day17, again well beyond expected timing constraints. No followup call recorded (desideratum). | **Violation of “Credit Check must occur within the first 24 hours” desideratum** and violations of several timing recommendations for loan decisions & informapplicant: decision comes too late to allow finalization before closure; applicant is informed far later than recommended, leading to incomplete documentation. |
| 3       | Credit Check at day1 (10:00) – no prior credit check, violating the strict sequence requirement and therefore a normative rule violation but not directly tied to desiderata violations.                     | **Violation of “Sequence” hard rule**; also an isolated timing issue beyond any recommended best practice. |

**2. Cases Failing Desiderata Conditions**

| Case ID | Failure(s) Relative to Desiderata |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| 1       | - Inform applicant promptly (48h). The case closed only after documentation was finalized on day3, missing the suggested prompt informapplicant window. <br>- Followup call recorded – not present in data. |
| 2       | - Credit check performed **after** risk assessment; this is a timing deviation from “Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment”. This does **not** affect desiderata directly but reflects poor sequencing logic that could be improved for future cases. <br>- No followup call mentioned, though the inform applicant step was completed promptly (13:00). |
| 3       | - Credit check performed at day1 (>24h after application), violating “Credit Check must occur within a short time window”. This does **not** break any desiderata but represents an ordering error. <br>- Loan decision made three days later, far exceeding the suggested 48hour notification period; also finalizing documentation is performed on day17 (over two weeks after approval). No followup call recorded – another timing gap from recommended practices. |

**3. Interpretations & Justifications**

- **Normative Violation Reasoning:**  
  - *Credit Check  Risk Assessment* must happen in order; skipping the credit check breaks core logic because it prevents a proper risk assessment based on sufficient data (e.g., financial capacity, credit history). The strict sequence is essential to ensure compliance with lender policies and maintain consistency across cases. Skipping steps erodes trust and may lead to compliance issues or legal exposure if decisions are later challenged.

- **Desideratum Observations:**  
  - *Inform Applicant Promptly*: While not a hard rule, timely communication enhances borrower satisfaction and can accelerate the closing process (e.g., faster documentation). A delay of more than two weeks from decision time to informing the applicant is suboptimal. The missing followup call suggests that any postdecision interaction—especially for positive outcomes—is overlooked; it could help verify expectations, resolve concerns, or gather additional information needed before finalizing paperwork.

- **Interpretation & Suggested Improvements:**  
  - For cases like ID2 and ID3: Implement an automatic workflow check that flags any activity violating the strict sequence (e.g., creditcheck after risk assessment) to ensure compliance. Automate reminders for informing applicants within a predefined window (48–72 hours). Consider adding a mandatory “Followup Call” step or at least logging it in case no call is made, as this can reveal process gaps that might otherwise remain hidden.

- **Process Optimization:**  
  - Enforce stricter time windows: credit check 24hours; decision and inform applicant must occur within the same calendar day if possible to keep documentation flow tight. A “Decision & Inform” step with a hard deadline (e.g., complete finalization of paperwork by X hours after loan decision) can prevent late closure issues.
  - Introduce periodic qualitycontrol checks for timing deviations, flagging cases where credit check or inform applicant steps are delayed beyond the recommended thresholds.

- **Documentation Insight:**  
  - The event log data shows that many applicants (cases2 and3) receive feedback at day1–3 after their loan application. This lag can be attributed to the nonstrict, but still reasonable timing suggested in desiderata: Credit check completed quickly; decision made promptly with informed applicant communication within 48h of that decision.

- **Potential Improvements:**  
  - Adopt a “Decision Dashboard” or automated alert system for each case ID showing current status (e.g., Approved  Finalize Documentation) so managers can spot delayed activities early. Realtime alerts could trigger corrective actions like reassigning staff, escalating to compliance teams, or sending followup reminders.
  - Consider adding a mandatory “Risk Review” step after the credit check where senior risk analysts validate that assessment against company thresholds before proceeding to loan decision—this would prevent errors such as approving loans for noncompliant borrowers.

**Conclusion**

- **Normative violations:** Cases2 and3 are directly breaking sequence, timing windows (credit vs. risk), inform applicant deadlines, and the rule “do not finalize documentation after a rejection.”  
- **Desideratum failures:** ID2’s credit check ordering error; ID3’s delayed loan decision (>48h) and extended finalization period beyond recommended 48hour notice.

By tightening these processes—enforcing sequence rules with automated checks, establishing clear time windows for each activity, adding mandatory followup actions (especially inform applicant), and recording the “Followup Call” step—the organization can move toward a more compliant, efficient loan application workflow that meets both normative expectations and desiderata best practices.
