It’s a BPMN swimlane process diagram for preparing a shipment.

- Lanes: Logistics (top), Office/Dispatch/Secretary (middle), Warehouse (bottom).
- Start event: Ship goods, which splits into parallel work.
- Office branch:
  - Clarify shipment method (uses order details).
  - Decision: Special handling?
    - If yes: get three quotes from logistics companies, then select a company and place the order.
  - Check if insurance is required (uses customer information).
    - If needed: insure parcel.
  - Write the package label (done in any case).
  - The insurance/label flow joins with the logistics-company selection.
- Warehouse branch:
  - Package goods. A 48hour timer boundary can trigger “Notify customer about delay.”
- Both branches synchronize, then:
  - Fill out shipment paperwork.
  - Move package to the pickup area.
  - End event: Shipment prepared.

Notable elements: parallel and exclusive gateways, a data object (order details), a customer-information datastore, and a timer boundary event for delays.
