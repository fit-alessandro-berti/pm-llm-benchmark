We need to produce answer: identify violations of normative rules across cases, explain reasons; then identify desiderata violations; give interpretations/justifications.

We have 3 cases.

Identify normative violations per case.

Case 1: sequence is correct: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. All ordering rules satisfied. No forbidden actions. So no violation.

Case 2: Violations.

- Step 2: Risk Assessment before Credit Check violates sequence (Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment). So normative violation.

- After loan decision (Rejected), they performed Finalize Documentation before closing case. That violates rule (no finalize after rejection). Also they performed Finalize Documentation after decision but before closing; but we need to check if closing occurs later? Table shows Finalize Documentation at 10:00, Close Case at 10:30. That is indeed after decision but still after rejection, finalize documentation is not allowed. So that's a violation.

- Also the rejection decision after credit check but risk assessment was before credit check, but that violation may have been earlier: they performed Risk Assessment before credit check, but risk assessment is defined as after credit check, so they performed risk assessment out of order. Also they might have performed Loan Decision after credit check, but risk assessment preceded it? Actually order: Risk Assessment (08:20), then Credit Check (08:20? Wait timeline: 08:20 Risk Assessment, 08:... Actually table shows:

08:20 Risk Assessment (no prior Credit Check),

08:20? Actually they list:

- 2024-01-11 08:20 Risk Assessment (No prior Credit Check - violates normative)

- 08:??? Wait after that they list "Credit Check" at 08:??? Actually timeline order: they listed Risk Assessment first, then Credit Check? In the table row order:

| 2 | 2024-01-11 08:00 Application Received |
| 2 | 2024-01-11 08:20 Risk Assessment |
| 2 | 2024-01-11 08:?? Credit Check? Actually they wrote "Credit Check" maybe at later timestamp? Table shows:

- 08:20 Risk Assessment
- 09:00 Credit Check
- 09:30 Loan Decision (Rejected)
- 10:00 Finalize Documentation
- 10:30 Close Case

But they wrote "Risk Assessment" before Credit Check; that's a violation.

Additionally, they performed Finalize Documentation after rejection, which is violation.

Additionally, they closed the case after finalizing documentation? Actually they closed after finalizing documentation; but for rejection finalization is not allowed; but they still closed after finalizing, which is extra violation.

So case 2 violates normative.

Case 3: Normative sequence is correct? It starts with Application Received at 09:00, then Credit Check at 10:00 (actually they have a gap, but credit check after 1.5 days). Then Risk Assessment 11:00, Loan Decision 12:00, Inform Applicant at 15:00 on 16th? Wait timeline shows Inform Applicant at 2024-01-16 15:00 (two days later). Then finalize documentation 2024-01-17 09:00, close case 2024-01-17 10:00.

Sequence respects ordering: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. All steps present, no reversal. They didn't finalize after rejection. So normative sequence is fine. There's no violation of mandatory steps. However steps may be delayed; but normative rules do not impose timing constraints, only order. So normative compliance is okay.

Thus normative violations: only Case 2.

Now desiderata violations.

Desiderata: credit check within 24h after application received; applicant informed within 48h after loan decision; follow-up call before closing.

Case 2: credit check occurs at 08:?? after risk assessment; application received at 08:00; credit check at 08:?? maybe soon: actually timeline: 08:20 risk assessment, 08:?? credit check maybe later; but anyway credit check happened within same day; but there is no explicit timestamp for credit check but likely within 24h; not a violation. However they performed risk assessment before credit check; but that's normative violation anyway.

But desiderata also require informing applicant promptly (within 48h of decision). In case 2, they informed applicant presumably at decision time? Actually they have "Loan Decision (Rejected)" at 09:30; then there is no explicit "Inform Applicant" row. Actually after decision they close case at 10:30 after finalize documentation. They didn't show "Inform Applicant". In table they didn't list inform applicant activity for case 2. Actually they omitted inform applicant; but they might have performed it implicitly before closing? The table doesn't include "Inform Applicant" for case 2. That might be considered a missing step but normative requires it after loan decision. However they didn't list it; maybe it's missing, but not necessarily a violation of desiderata because it's normative required; but maybe they just omitted it; but the question: identify which cases fail to meet desiderata conditions.

Desiderata are recommended best practices, not mandatory. So we check: 

- Credit check within 24h of application: For case 1 credit check at 09:30 same day, so okay. Case 2 credit check after risk assessment; risk assessment at 08:20; credit check maybe later same day; but likely within 24h. Not violation. Case 3 credit check at 10:00 on 14th, application at 09:00 on 12th, that's 48 hours later (actually 2 days). That exceeds 24h window, so violates desideratum (recommended to be within 24h). So case 3 fails that desideratum.

- Inform applicant within 48h of decision: In case 1 decision at 11:00, inform at 13:00 same day, okay. Case 2 decision at 09:30, but they didn't have inform step recorded; maybe omitted; but if they didn't inform at all, that violates desiderata. However normative requires inform after decision, but they didn't list it; maybe they assumed it's included before closing? Not sure. Could note as missing but not necessarily violation. But we can treat as missing step, but it's normative not desiderata, but we can mention that they didn't inform promptly. Since there is no inform activity, it's missing which is more severe normative violation. However for desiderata, we can say they didn't inform within 48h (can't evaluate). We'll assume they didn't do it.

- Follow-up call before closing: Case 1 they didn't mention follow-up call; but they had finalize documentation and close. No follow-up call recorded; that is a desiderata violation (they skipped recommended follow-up call). Case 2 also no follow-up call. Case 3 no follow-up call either. All three lack follow-up call; but it's not a severe violation; but we can note that they failed to perform recommended follow-up call before closing.

- Inform applicant within recommended window: case 3 took two days (decision at 12:00 on 14th? Actually decision at 12:00 on 14th? They have decision at 12:00 on 14th? Wait timeline: they have loan decision at 12:00 on 14th? Actually table: "Loan Decision (Approved)" at 2024-01-14 12:00. Then inform applicant at 2024-01-16 15:00, which is >48h after decision (approx 2 days 3 hours). So violates desideratum.

- Credit check within 24h: case 3 credit check at 10:00 on 14th, application at 09:00 on 12th, that is 2 days + 1 hour = 49 hours >24h, violates desideratum.

Thus desiderata violations: Cases 2 and 3 possibly (if we consider missing inform step). Let's list:

- Case 2: No explicit "Inform Applicant" activity recorded; also finalize documentation after rejection; but desiderata about timing: credit check likely within 24h; maybe okay; but failing to inform promptly may be considered a desiderata violation; also missing follow-up call.

- Case 3: Credit check delayed beyond 24h; inform applicant delayed beyond 48h; no follow-up call.

Now produce answer: part 1 normative violations identified and reasons; part 2 desiderata violations identified and explanations; part 3 provide interpretations/justifications.

Interpretations: for case 2: maybe the risk assessment was performed on preliminary data; credit check later due to system delay; maybe they reorganized tasks; maybe they had parallel processing but recorded out of order; maybe they used a provisional risk assessment to decide early; but can't change normative rule.

Case 3: delays may be due to workload, backlog, scheduling; perhaps credit check queued; maybe loan officer needed more time; but still normative satisfied; just slower.

Also justification for finalize documentation after rejection not allowed; but they maybe mistakenly performed it; maybe a system bug; but it's a violation.

Now craft final answer organized.

Will produce bullet points.

Let's answer.

</think>
## 1.  Normativerule violations  

| Case | Normrule broken | Why it is a violation (according to the strict sequence) |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Case2** | 1 **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**  <br>2 **Finalize Documentation after a rejection** | • The process description says *“Credit check must be performed before any risk evaluation is done.”*  In the log the **Risk Assessment** activity is recorded at **08:20**, **before** the **Credit Check** (which is recorded later at **08:?**/09:00).  This reverses the mandatory order.  <br>• After the **Loan Decision (Rejected)** the log shows **Finalize Documentation** at **10:00** and only afterwards **Close Case** at **10:30**.  The rule states that *“If the loan is rejected, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation.”*  Therefore the extra step is prohibited. |
| **Case1** | – (none) | All activities follow the prescribed order: ApplicationCreditCheckRiskAssessmentLoanDecisionInformApplicantFinalizeDocumentationCloseCase. No step is skipped, reordered or performed in a forbidden context. |
| **Case3** | – (none) | The sequence is strictly respected: ApplicationCreditCheckRiskAssessmentLoanDecisionInformApplicantFinalizeDocumentationCloseCase.  No rule is broken, even though some steps are delayed (see desiderata below). |

**Summary of normative violations:** only **Case2** violates one or more hard rules (ordering and postrejection documentation).  

---

## 2.  Desiderata (recommended but not mandatory) – where they are missed  

| Desideratum | Recommended target | Cases that **fail** to meet it | What the deviation means (suboptimal, not a fatal error) |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Creditcheck within 24h of application** | 24h after *Application Received* | **Case3** (credit check at 10:00 on 14Jan, application at 09:00 on 12Jan  49h later) | The check was considerably delayed, likely because of a backlog or scheduling issue.  It does not break any hard rule, but it lengthens the overall processing time and may affect customer satisfaction. |
| **Applicant informed within 48h of the loan decision** | 48h after *Loan Decision* | **Case3** (decision at 12:00 on 14Jan, informant at 15:00 on 16Jan  39h+15min  63h) <br>**Case2** – no explicit *Inform Applicant* activity is recorded (the step is simply omitted). | The notification was either missing or arrived well after the recommended window.  Again, this does not invalidate the case, but it deviates from the bestpractice guideline of “prompt communication”. |
| **Followup call before closing the case** | Call must occur *sometime before* the final “Close Case” step | **All three cases (1,2,3)** – no *Followup Call* entry appears in any log. | Skipping the followup call is a minor deviation; it is only a recommended best practice to “ensure all parties are aligned”.  Its absence does not affect the correctness of the process flow, only the thoroughness of stakeholder communication. |

**What counts as a desiderata breach?**  
- If a recommended time window is explicitly violated (e.g., credit check >24h, decisiontoinform >48h).  
- If a recommended activity is omitted altogether (e.g., no followup call).  
- The breaches are **not** normative errors; they are simply “suboptimal” or “lessthanideal” behaviours.

---

## 3.  Possible interpretations / justifications for the observed behaviours  

| Case | Observed anomaly | Plausible interpretation (consistent with the stated constraints) |
|------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Case2** | • Risk Assessment before Credit Check  <br>• Finalize Documentation after a rejection | • **Systemrecording error** – the log may have captured the *riskassessment* entry before the *creditcheck* entry simply because the creditcheck activity was entered later in the UI (e.g., a “quickcheck” status was flagged as “Risk Assessment” mistakenly).  <br>• **Manual override**: the analyst may have performed a provisional risk assessment to decide whether to continue the credit check, but the process definition requires the formal credit check first; this represents a procedural shortcut that violated the documented ordering rule.  <br>• **Documentation postrejection** – after a rejection the team might have needed to archive the case or generate a “rejectionsummary” document; the system automatically generated a *Finalize Documentation* entry, but the business rule states that such documentation must **not** be finalized for a rejected loan.  This could be a misconfiguration of the workflow engine rather than an intentional violation. |
| **Case3** | • Credit check 49h after application  <br>• Inform applicant ~63h after decision  <br>• No followup call | • **High workload / backlog** – the loanprocessing team may have had a surge in applications, causing the creditcheck step to be queued behind other priority tasks.  The delay is therefore a capacity issue, not a rule breach.  <br>• **Scheduling of notifications** – the informapplicant activity could have been delayed because the responsible officer was on leave or because the notification template required manual review before sending; the 48hour guideline is a “preferred” target, so a twoday lag, while suboptimal, is understandable.  <br>• **Followup call omitted** – the followup call is a voluntary touchpoint; in a fully automated environment the call may be replaced by an automatic email reminder, and the log simply does not capture it.  The absence therefore reflects a design decision rather than an error. |
| **All cases** | No explicit *Followup Call* recorded | • The process description says the call is *encouraged* but not required.  Some organisations replace it with a written confirmation or an automated statusupdate.  Hence the missing call is not necessarily a mistake; it may be a purposeful substitution that still satisfies the intent of “ensuring all parties are aligned”. |

### Takeaway for process owners  

1. **Focus first on normative violations** – they break the legally or contractually binding flow (as seen in Case2).  Corrective actions should enforce the proper ordering and prevent any postrejection documentation.  
2. **Monitor desiderata as performance indicators** – they highlight efficiency and customerexperience gaps (e.g., Case3’s 48hour notification breach).  Remediation can be pursued through workload balancing, staffing adjustments, or workflow automation, but it is not a “failure” in the strict sense.  
3. **Document the rationale** – when a deviation occurs (e.g., a creditcheck delay), capture the business reason (backlog, system issue, manual override).  This makes it easier to distinguish genuine procedural shortcuts from isolated incidents and to decide whether a rule change or a processimprovement is warranted.  

In short, **Case2** is the only genuine normative breach; **Case3** and, to a lesser extent, **Case2** also miss the recommended timing and followupcall desiderata.  The observed patterns can be plausibly explained by operational pressures, system quirks, or intentional but noncompliant shortcuts, all of which are useful insights for refining the loanapplication workflow.
