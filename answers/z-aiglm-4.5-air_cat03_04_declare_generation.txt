To construct the DECLARE model for the described product design and launch process, we define constraints based on the logical flow of activities. The model is a Python dictionary where each key corresponds to a DECLARE constraint type. Unary constraints (single activities) have values as dictionaries mapping activities to `(support, confidence)` tuples, while binary constraints (activity pairs) use nested dictionaries for the pairs. Support and confidence are set to `1.0` for simplicity.

### DECLARE Model:
```python
declare_model = {
    # Unary Constraints
