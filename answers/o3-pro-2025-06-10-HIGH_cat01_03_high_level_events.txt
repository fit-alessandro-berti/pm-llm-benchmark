Proposed high-level model for the manufacturing process

High-level step 1  –  Material Preparation  
Included low-level events  
• Retrieve raw metal sheet  
• Scan barcode  
• Place metal sheet on table  
• Align metal sheet  
• Preheat metal sheet  

Rationale  
These five actions:  
a) are executed immediately after a new CaseID appears,  
b) are all performed by resources whose role is “operator” or “handling / positioning equipment,” and  
c) have a clear common purpose – getting the raw work-piece identified, positioned, and brought to processing temperature.  
Taken together they define one coherent preparation phase, finished when the sheet reaches its target temperature (preheating).  


High-level step 2  –  Welding / Mechanical Assembly  
Included low-level events  
• Pick up welding tool  
• Weld corner A  
• Weld corner B  

Rationale  
These actions are contiguous in time, executed by the same operator (Operator B) with the same ToolID W-12, and all relate to permanently joining the metal sheet.  “Pick up welding tool” is a technical set-up activity and therefore part of the same work package.  


High-level step 3  –  Weld Quality Verification  
Included low-level events  
• Measure weld integrity  

Rationale  
A single measurement performed by Quality Sensor #1 acts as the acceptance gate between assembly and any subsequent surface work.  It is materially and temporally distinct and is always executed by a dedicated resource class “Quality Sensor.”  Even though it is only one event, it logically forms its own phase.  


High-level step 4  –  Surface Finishing  
Included low-level events  
• Apply protective coating  
• Dry coating  

Rationale  
Both events modify the surface of the part and are always executed back-to-back by coating and heating units.  They mark the transformation of the product’s outer layer and therefore belong in a separate “finishing” phase.  


High-level step 5  –  Final Visual Inspection  
Included low-level events  
• Visual check  

Rationale  
The last action in every trace, done by a human inspector, provides the final go/no-go decision before the case leaves the line.  It is again a single event but represents a distinct quality-assurance phase.  



Mapping table (applies to every CaseID)

Retrieve raw metal sheet                           Material Preparation  
Scan barcode                                       Material Preparation  
Place metal sheet on table                         Material Preparation  
Align metal sheet                                  Material Preparation  
Preheat metal sheet                                Material Preparation  
Pick up welding tool                               Welding / Mechanical Assembly  
Weld corner A                                      Welding / Mechanical Assembly  
Weld corner B                                      Welding / Mechanical Assembly  
Measure weld integrity                             Weld Quality Verification  
Apply protective coating                           Surface Finishing  
Dry coating                                        Surface Finishing  
Visual check                                       Final Visual Inspection  



How to detect these groups in the full log (rules you can implement)

1. Start a new “Material Preparation” block for a CaseID at its first event; keep adding events until the first occurrence of “Preheat metal sheet.”  
2. Start “Welding / Mechanical Assembly” at the first “Pick up welding tool.”  This block ends with the last welding activity (“Weld corner …”) just before any “Measure weld integrity.”  
3. “Weld Quality Verification” consists solely of “Measure weld integrity.”  
4. “Surface Finishing” starts with the first coating event (“Apply protective coating”) and ends with the drying event (“Dry coating”).  
5. Any “Visual check” occurring after drying is “Final Visual Inspection.”  

These rules rely on  
• the deterministic ordering shown in the sample,  
• unique keywords in the activity names (“Preheat”, “Weld”, “Measure weld integrity”, etc.), and  
• the fact that timestamps between phases are only a few seconds, so time gaps are not required for segmentation.

(The same structure applies to case B2 and every other case in the full log.)

Using these five aggregated activities provides a concise, business-friendly process view while preserving the essential control-flow information of the original detailed log.
