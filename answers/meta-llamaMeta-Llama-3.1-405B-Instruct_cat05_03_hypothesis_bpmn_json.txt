Based on the provided BPMN model, I've generated a list of 20 relevant questions over the process. I've also assigned a confidence score for each question, indicating how likely the question is to be relevant and answerable based on the provided process model.

**Confidence Score Legend:**

* High (H): 80-100% confident that the question is relevant and answerable
* Medium (M): 50-79% confident that the question is relevant and answerable
* Low (L): 20-49% confident that the question is relevant and answerable
* Uncertain (U): Less than 20% confident that the question is relevant and answerable

**Questions and Confidence Scores:**
