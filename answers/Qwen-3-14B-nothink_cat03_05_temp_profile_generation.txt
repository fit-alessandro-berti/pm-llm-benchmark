### Notes:
- The values are **estimated** based on typical supply chain timelines and the complexity of the activities involved.
- Pairs that are **not directly connected** in the process flow (e.g., `('SS', 'QI')`, `('RC', 'DT')`) are included to reflect **eventual follow-up** in the process execution.
- Standard deviations are generally a **fraction of the average** time, reflecting process variability.
- The dictionary includes a **representative subset** of activity pairs, including both **direct and indirect** transitions, to demonstrate the **complexity** of the supply chain process.

Let me know if you'd like to add more pairs or refine the model further!
