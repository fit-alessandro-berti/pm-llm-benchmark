To group the events into separate cases based on the provided attributes and logical sequence, we can look for patterns such as patient age, gender, department changes, and specific activities that indicate a transition from one case to another. Here's how the events can be logically grouped:

### Case 1
1. **Patient 1 (Male, 45 years old, ER)**
   - Register patient (2024-03-15T08:05:13Z)
   - Initial triage (2024-03-15T08:10:50Z)
   - X-ray imaging (2024-03-15T08:15:42Z)
   - Doctor consultation (2024-03-15T08:23:10Z)
   - Prescription created (2024-03-15T08:27:00Z)
   - Patient discharged (2024-03-15T08:30:05Z)

### Case 2
2. **Patient 2 (Female, 62 years old, ER and Surgery)**
   - Register patient (2024-03-15T08:07:02Z)
   - Initial triage (2024-03-15T08:12:29Z)
   - Lab test requested (2024-03-15T08:16:10Z)
   - Lab test completed (2024-03-15T08:20:27Z)
   - Doctor consultation (2024-03-15T08:21:37Z)
   - Patient discharged (2024-03-15T08:31:37Z)

### Case 3
3. **Patient 3 (Male, 28 years old, Surgery and ER)**
   - Register patient (2024-03-15T08:07:15Z)
   - Doctor consultation (2024-03-15T08:13:00Z)
   - Surgery preparation (2024-03-15T08:16:45Z)
   - Surgery performed (2024-03-15T08:25:19Z)
   - Recovery room (2024-03-15T08:35:29Z)
   - Patient discharged (2024-03-15T08:40:13Z)

### Explanation:
1. **Case 1 (Patient 1):**
   - Patient 1 is registered, undergoes initial triage in the ER, and receives follow-up care, including X-rays, consultations, and a prescription. This sequence indicates a single case where the patient remains in the ER.
   
2. **Case 2 (Patient 2):**
   - Patient 2 is registered, undergoes initial triage in the ER, then gets a lab test, and follows up in the ER. This sequence shows a transition from ER to ER (for lab results) and then discharged, indicating a single case.
   
3. **Case 3 (Patient 3):**
   - Patient 3 is registered, receives a doctor consultation, goes to surgery preparation, and then has surgery. Post-surgery, the patient goes to the recovery room and is discharged. This sequence shows a single case involving both ER and Surgery departments.

By examining the sequence of events and logical flow, we can infer that each patient's journey through the hospital corresponds to a distinct case.
