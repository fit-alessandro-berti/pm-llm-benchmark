**Explanation of the Log Skeleton:**

1. **Equivalence**: Activities that must occur the same number of times (typically once each for a standard order flow)

2. **Always Before**: Defines the precedence relationships - each activity must be preceded by certain other activities

3. **Always After**: Ensures that certain activities must follow others at some point in the future

4. **Never Together**: Empty set as all activities are part of the normal fulfillment process

5. **Activity Frequencies**: Most activities occur exactly once per order, except Record Payment which may occur 0 or 1 time (pending payment)

6. **Directly Follows**: Defines the immediate sequential relationships in the standard order fulfillment workflow
