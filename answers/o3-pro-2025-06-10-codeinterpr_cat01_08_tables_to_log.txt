### How the log was built

1. Case identification  
   – Each `order_id` is treated as a unique process instance (case).

2. Activity derivation  
   – Tables were mapped to lifecycle steps:  
     Orders  “Order Created”  
     Order Lines  “Item Picked” (one event per line item)  
     Delivery  “Order Dispatched” and “Order Arrived” (one pair per delivery record)  
     Invoice  “Invoice Issued”  
     Payments  “Payment Received”  

3. Timestamps  
   – Original date/time fields were used without modification, guaranteeing the real chronological order inside each case.

4. Resource mapping  
   – `resource_id` values were resolved to human-readable names/roles via the Resources table.  
   – For automated steps (payments) a generic “Payment Gateway” resource was assumed because the ERP does not record a person.

5. Additional attributes  
   – Key contextual data is preserved in the “Other Attributes” column so it can be used as case- or event-level attributes during analysis.

6. Missing data  
   – Order 1004 currently has no delivery, invoice, or payment records; the case therefore ends after picking.  
   – No explicit “Order Closed” event exists, so none was added.

You can copy the table directly into Excel/CSV or any process-mining tool (e.g., Disco, Celonis, PM4Py) and parse it using `Case ID`, `Activity Name`, and `Timestamp` as the mandatory columns.
