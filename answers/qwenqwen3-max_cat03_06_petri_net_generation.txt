Here's the Python code to construct an accepting Petri net for the complex insurance claim management process:

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create the Petri net
net = PetriNet(name="Insurance Claim Management Process")

# Define places (states between activities)
start = PetriNet.Place(name="start")
after_cr = PetriNet.Place(name="after_cr")          # after Claim Registration
after_dv = PetriNet.Place(name="after_dv")          # after Document Verification
after_rds = PetriNet.Place(name="after_rds")        # after Re-Document Submission
after_fc = PetriNet.Place(name="after_fc")          # after Fraud Check
after_ii = PetriNet.Place(name="after_ii")          # after In-depth Investigation
after_ca = PetriNet.Place(name="after_ca")          # after Claim Assessment
after_ap = PetriNet.Place(name="after_ap")          # after Approval
after_p = PetriNet.Place(name="after_p")            # after Payment
after_n = PetriNet.Place(name="after_n")            # after Notification
end = PetriNet.Place(name="end")                    # final closure state

# Add places to the net
places = [start, after_cr, after_dv, after_rds, after_fc, after_ii, after_ca, after_ap, after_p, after_n, end]
for place in places:
    net.places.add(place)

# Define transitions (activities)
claim_registration = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_cr", label="Claim Registration")
document_verification = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_dv", label="Document Verification")
re_document_submission = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_rds", label="Re-Document Submission")
fraud_check = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_fc", label="Fraud Check")
in_depth_investigation = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_ii", label="In-depth Investigation")
claim_assessment = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_ca", label="Claim Assessment")
approval = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_ap", label="Approval")
payment = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_p", label="Payment")
notification = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_n", label="Notification")
closure = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_cl", label="Closure")

# Add transitions to the net
transitions = [claim_registration, document_verification, re_document_submission, 
               fraud_check, in_depth_investigation, claim_assessment, approval, 
               payment, notification, closure]
for transition in transitions:
    net.transitions.add(transition)

# Define the main flow arcs
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start, claim_registration, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_registration, after_cr, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_cr, document_verification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(document_verification, after_dv, net)

# Document Verification loop with Re-Document Submission
# If documents are incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_dv, re_document_submission, net)  # incomplete documents
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(re_document_submission, after_rds, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_rds, document_verification, net)  # back to DV

# Normal flow from DV to Fraud Check (when documents are complete)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_dv, fraud_check, net)  # complete documents

# Fraud Check loop with In-depth Investigation
# If fraud doubts arise, go to II, then back to FC
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_fc, in_depth_investigation, net)  # fraud doubts
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(in_depth_investigation, after_ii, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_ii, fraud_check, net)  # back to FC

# Normal flow from FC to Claim Assessment (when no fraud)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_fc, claim_assessment, net)  # no fraud detected

# Continue main flow
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_check, after_fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_assessment, after_ca, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_ca, approval, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(approval, after_ap, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_ap, payment, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment, after_p, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_p, notification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notification, after_n, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_n, closure, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(closure, end, net)

# Define initial and final markings
im = Marking()
im[start] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[end] = 1
```

This Petri net models the insurance claim management process with the following key features:

1. **Main Flow**: The standard sequence from Claim Registration through to Closure
2. **Document Verification Loop**: After Document Verification, if documents are incomplete, the process goes to Re-Document Submission and loops back to Document Verification
3. **Fraud Check Loop**: After Fraud Check, if doubts arise, the process goes to In-depth Investigation and loops back to Fraud Check
4. **Places**: Represent the states between activities, allowing for proper token flow
5. **Transitions**: Labeled with the actual activity names as specified in the scenario
6. **Initial Marking**: One token in the `start` place representing a new claim arriving
7. **Final Marking**: One token in the `end` place representing a closed claim

The Petri net correctly handles the conditional loops for document re-submission and in-depth investigation, allowing these activities to occur multiple times as needed before proceeding to the next main step in the process.
