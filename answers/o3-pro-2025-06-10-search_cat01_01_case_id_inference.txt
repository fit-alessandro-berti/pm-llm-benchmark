Below is one plausible case-clustering of the 18 interleaved events.  
The logic relies on (a) identical, rarely-changing patient attributes (age + gender), (b) a clinically coherent activity order, and (c) realistic elapsed times.


CASE A“45-year-old male – ER leg fracture”
Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  

1. Register patient (08:05) – ER, 45 M  
4. Initial triage (08:10) – ER, 45 M  
7. X-ray imaging (08:15) – Radiology, 45 M  
12. Doctor consultation (08:23) – ER, 45 M (diagnosis = hairline fracture)  
15. Patient discharged (08:30) – ER, 45 M  

Why they fit together  
• Unique age/gender (45 M) never appears in any other row.  
• Sequence matches a typical minor-fracture pathway: register  triage  imaging  doctor review  discharge with outpatient follow-up.  
• Timestamps are strictly increasing and clustered within ~25 minutes.


CASE B“62-year-old female – ER minor infection”
Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  

2. Register patient (08:07) – ER, 62 F  
5. Initial triage (08:12) – ER, 62 F  
8. Lab test requested (08:16) – ER, 62 F  
10. Lab test completed (08:20) – Laboratory, 62 F  
11. Doctor consultation (08:22) – ER, 62 F (diagnosis = minor infection)  
14. Prescription created (08:27) – ER, 62 F  
17. Patient discharged (08:35) – ER, 62 F  

Why they fit together  
• The 62-year-old female attributes are unique in the log.  
• Activity order is clinically sensible for a mild infection: registration  triage  lab request/completion  doctor review  prescription  discharge.  
• Elapsed time (~28 minutes) is plausible for a fast-track ER visit.


CASE C“28-year-old male – Elective knee arthroscopy”
Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18  

3. Register patient (08:07) – Surgery, 28 M (scheduled case)  
6. Doctor consultation (08:13) – Surgery, 28 M (pre-op check)  
9. Surgery preparation (08:16) – Surgery, 28 M  
13. Surgery performed (08:25) – Surgery, 28 M (arthroscopy)  
16. Recovery room (08:31) – Surgery, 28 M  
18. Patient discharged (08:40) – Surgery, 28 M  

Why they fit together  
• The 28 M attributes appear only in these rows.  
• All activities occur in (or directly relate to) the Surgery department and follow a standard elective-surgery timeline: registration  pre-op consult  prep  procedure  recovery  discharge.  
• Timestamps progress logically over ~33 minutes (short, but common in arthroscopic day-surgery centers).
