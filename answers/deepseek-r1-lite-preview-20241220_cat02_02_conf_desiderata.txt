**1. Violations of Normative Rules:**

- **Case 2:**
  - *Violation 1:* Performed **Risk Assessment** at 8:20 before completing the **Credit Check** at 9:00, which breaks the rule that a **Credit Check** must occur before **Risk Assessment**.
  - *Violation 2:* Finalized **Documentation** at 10:00 despite the loan being **rejected** at 9:30, which is not allowed as documentation should only be finalized if the loan is approved.

**2. Failures to Meet Desiderata:**

- **Case 2:**
  - *Desideratum Violation:* Finalized documentation after a rejection, which, while a normative violation, also contravenes the recommendation to avoid such actions.

- **Case 3:**
  - *Desideratum Violation 1:* Conducted **Credit Check** on January 14th at 10:00, which is more than 24 hours after receiving the application on January 12th at 9:00.
  - *Desideratum Violation 2:* **Informed the Applicant** at 15:00 on January 16th, which is more than 48 hours after the **Loan Decision** was made on January 14th at 12:00.
  - *Desideratum Violation 3:* No **Follow-up Call** was made before closing the case, though it's just a recommended practice.

**3. Interpretations or Justifications:**

- **Case 2:**
  - The deviation in sequence (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) might be due to an urgent need to evaluate risk quickly, but it does not excuse the violation of the normative process.
  - The documentation finalization after rejection could be a mistake or oversight, possibly due to operator error.

- **Case 3:**
  - The delays in Credit Check and informing the applicant could be due to a backlog in processing or system delays, which are external factors beyond immediate control.
  - The lack of a Follow-up Call might simply be an oversight or could be due to resource constraints, but it doesn't affect the core process outcome.

**Conclusion:**

- **Case 1** strictly adheres to both the normative rules and desiderata.
- **Case 2** violates the normative process with deviations in sequence and actions post-rejection.
- **Case 3** follows the normative rules but falls short on timing recommendations and the suggested Follow-up Call.
