Based on the scenario, here is a Python dictionary representing the DECLARE model. The logic for choosing each constraint is explained in the comments within the code.

```python
declare_model = {
    # Unary constraints: Rules applying to a single activity.
    # --------------------------------------------------------

    # 'existence': The activity must appear at least once in the process.
    # We assume all listed activities are essential for a successful product launch.
    'existence': {
        'Idea Generation (IG)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'Design Draft (DD)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'Cost Evaluation (CE)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'Prototype Creation (PC)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'Laboratory Testing (LT)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'User Testing (UT)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'Approval Gate (AG)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'Marketing Plan (MP)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'Final Launch (FL)': (1.0, 1.0),
    },

    # 'absence': The activity must not appear.
    # No activities in this scenario are explicitly forbidden.
    'absence': {},

    # 'exactly_one': The activity must appear exactly once.
    # Key milestones like the initial idea, final approval, and the launch itself
    # should ideally happen only once per product.
    'exactly_one': {
        'Idea Generation (IG)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'Approval Gate (AG)': (1.0, 1.0),
        'Final Launch (FL)': (1.0, 1.0),
    },

    # 'init': The activity must be the first one in the process.
    # Every process must start with an idea.
    'init': {
        'Idea Generation (IG)': (1.0, 1.0),
    },

    # Binary constraints: Rules defining relationships between two activities.
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------

    # 'responded_existence': If A happens, B must also happen (before or after).
    # If a prototype is made, it must eventually be approved.
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Prototype Creation (PC)', 'Approval Gate (AG)'): (1.0, 1.0),
    },

    # 'coexistence': If A happens, B must happen, and vice-versa. Order does not matter.
    # Technical and cost checks are both required for a design, and can happen in parallel.
    # Both lab and user tests are required for a prototype.
    'coexistence': {
        ('Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)', 'Cost Evaluation (CE)'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Laboratory Testing (LT)', 'User Testing (UT)'): (1.0, 1.0),
    },
    
    # 'response': If A happens, B must happen at some point after A.
    # A design draft must be followed by prototype creation.
    # Approval must be followed by a final launch.
    'response': {
        ('Design Draft (DD)', 'Prototype Creation (PC)'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Approval Gate (AG)', 'Final Launch (FL)'): (1.0, 1.0),
    },

    # 'precedence': B can only happen if A has happened at some point before.
    # You cannot create a prototype without a design draft.
    # You cannot run tests without a prototype.
    # You cannot create a marketing plan without management approval.
    'precedence': {
        ('Design Draft (DD)', 'Prototype Creation (PC)'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Prototype Creation (PC)', 'User Testing (UT)'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Prototype Creation (PC)', 'Laboratory Testing (LT)'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Approval Gate (AG)', 'Marketing Plan (MP)'): (1.0, 1.0),
    },

    # 'succession': Response + Precedence. If A happens, B must happen later,
    # and B can only happen if A has happened before.
    # An idea must be followed by a design draft.
    # An approval must be followed by a marketing plan.
    'succession': {
        ('Idea Generation (IG)', 'Design Draft (DD)'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('User Testing (UT)', 'Approval Gate (AG)'): (1.0, 1.0),
    },

    # 'altresponse': After A, B or C must follow.
    'altresponse': {},

    # 'altprecedence': B or C must happen before A.
    'altprecedence': {},

    # 'altsuccession': A is followed by B or C, and B/C is preceded by A.
    'altsuccession': {},

    # 'chainresponse': If A happens, B must happen immediately after.
    'chainresponse': {},

    # 'chainprecedence': B can only happen if A happened immediately before.
    'chainprecedence': {},

    # 'chainsuccession': Succession, but immediately after.
    # Once the marketing plan is finalized, the launch should be the very next major step.
    'chainsuccession': {
        ('Marketing Plan (MP)', 'Final Launch (FL)'): (1.0, 1.0),
    },

    # Negative constraints
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------

    # 'noncoexistence': A and B cannot both occur in the process.
    'noncoexistence': {},

    # 'nonsuccession': B cannot happen after A.
    # It is illogical to go back to designing after the product has been launched.
    # User testing should not happen before lab testing is complete.
    'nonsuccession': {
        ('Final Launch (FL)', 'Design Draft (DD)'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('User Testing (UT)', 'Laboratory Testing (LT)'): (1.0, 1.0),
    },

    # 'nonchainsuccession': B cannot happen immediately after A.
    'nonchainsuccession': {},
}

# Example of how to access a value in the model
# print(declare_model['init'])
# print(declare_model['succession'][('Idea Generation (IG)', 'Design Draft (DD)')])
