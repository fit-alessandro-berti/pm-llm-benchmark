**Step1 – Quick visual inspection of the sensor streams**

| Sensor | What it usually tells us in a shopfloor context |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Temperature** | Heatgenerating operations (cutting, welding, heating) raise it; idle or lowenergy steps keep it near ambient (20°C). |
| **Pressure** | Hydraulic or pneumatic pressure is often used to drive a tool or to press parts together. |
| **Vibration (Hz)** | Mechanical motion of a spindle, hammer, or robot arm. High, periodic vibration  cutting, drilling, or welding torch movement. |
| **Material Flow (units/s)** | Feed of raw material into a machine (e.g., sheet metal feed, conveyor). Zero flow  no material being processed. |
| **Tool Position (mm)** | Linear or rotary travel of the workhead. A steady increase indicates a moving tool; a constant zero means the tool is parked. |
| **Energy (kWh)** | Power consumption – spikes accompany active processes; low values mean idle or standby. |

**Step2 – Plotting the timeline (textual view)**  

```
010s  :  (temp20, press1, vib0, flow0, pos0,  low)    idle / standby
1030s :  temp rises to 58°C, press  to 1.5bar, vib  to 38Hz,
          flow = 5units/s, pos climbs 010mm, energy climbs  active
3040s :  temp drops to 40°C, press  to 2bar, vib  to 10Hz,
          flow  to 2units/s, pos = 15mm, energy still high
4045s :  temp spikes to 80°C, vib  to 50Hz, flow = 0, energy peak
4555s :  temp falls back to ~30°C, vib 1Hz, flow = 01, pos = 1520mm,
          energy moderate
5565s :  back to baseline (20°C, press 1bar, vib 0, flow 0, pos 0, low energy)
```

**Step3 – Identify “phases” (clusters of consecutive events with similar sensor behaviour)**  

| Phase | Event # | Sensor pattern (summary) | Likely physical meaning |
|-------|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **A – Machine startup / idle** | 13 | Temp 20°C, Press=1bar, Vib=0, Flow=0, Pos=0, Energy0.40.5kWh | Machine is powered, no tool movement, waiting for material. |
| **B – Cutting / material removal** | 46 | Temp rises 5058°C, Pressure 11.5bar, Vibration 3038Hz, Flow=5units/s, Tool position 510mm, Energy 23kWh | High vibration + material flow + rising temperature  spindle / laser cutting of a sheet. |
| **C – Tool positioning / holding** | 78 | Temp falls to 40°C, Pressure  to 2bar, Vibration low (10Hz), Flow=2units/s, Position stays at 15mm, Energy 2kWh | Tool has finished cutting and is being held/pressed against the workpiece (e.g., clamping for the next step). |
| **D – Welding / heatintensive operation** | 9 | Temp spikes to 80°C, Vibration 50Hz, Flow=0, Position unchanged (15mm), Energy peaks at 5kWh | Very high temperature and vibration with no material feed  welding torch or spotwelding cycle. |
| **E – Cooling / inspection / transport** | 1012 | Temp drops to 3025°C, Pressure back to 1bar, Vibration low (15Hz), Flow01, Position moves 1520mm, Energy moderate (11.6kWh) | After welding the part cools while being moved to a qualityinspection station; lowenergy motion of a conveyor or robot arm. |
| **F – Return to idle** | 1315 | Sensors back to baseline (20°C, 1bar, 0vib, 0flow, 0pos, low energy) | Machine is reset, waiting for the next workpiece. |

**Step4 – Assign intuitive activity labels**

| Phase | Suggested activity label | Reasoning |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------|
| **A** | **“Idle / Setup”** | No material flow, tool at home position, low power – typical of a standby or initial setup stage. |
| **B** | **“Cutting Metal”** | The combination of rising temperature, moderate pressure, high vibration, and a steady materialflow rate points to a cutting operation (e.g., CNC spindle or laser cutting). |
| **C** | **“Clamping / Position Holding”** | Temperature drops, vibration reduces, pressure increases (to hold the part), and the tool stays at a fixed position – a clamping or holding phase before the next operation. |
| **D** | **“Welding / SpotWelding”** | A sharp temperature spike together with a vibration burst, but with no material flow, is characteristic of a welding torch that generates heat while the tool remains stationary. |
| **E** | **“Cooling / Quality Inspection / Transfer”** | Temperature falls, the tool moves slowly (position 1520mm) with low vibration and low energy – consistent with a cooling period and/or moving the part to an inspection station. |
| **F** | **“Idle / Reset”** | Sensors return to the original baseline, indicating the machine has completed the cycle and is ready for the next workpiece. |

**Step5 – Summarised labeled process**

```
13    Idle / Setup
46    Cutting Metal
78    Clamping / Position Holding
9      Welding / SpotWelding
1012  Cooling / Quality Inspection / Transfer
1315  Idle / Reset
```

**Why the labels make sense**

* **Temperature** is the strongest indicator of heatgenerating steps. The only periods with a noticeable rise (>40°C) are phasesB (moderate) andD (high).  
* **Vibration** mirrors tool motion: high, periodic vibration (3038Hz) during cutting, a brief surge (50Hz) during welding, and low values when the tool is stationary or only moving slowly.  
* **Material Flow** is present only while the workpiece is being fed into the cutter (phaseB) and drops to zero when the part is already cut and being held (phasesCD).  
* **Pressure** climbs when the machine clamps the part (phaseC) and returns to the low value once the part leaves the clamp (phaseEF).  
* **Tool Position** moves from 0mm (home)  510mm (cutting travel)  15mm (clamp/weld point)  20mm (transfer), matching a typical linearaxis workflow.  
* **Energy** mirrors the intensity of the operation: low during idle, moderate during cutting and clamping, and a clear peak during welding.

Putting these observations together yields a coherent highlevel process model that can be used for further processmining analysis (e.g., discovering bottlenecks, estimating cycle time, or checking conformance to a prescribed workflow).
