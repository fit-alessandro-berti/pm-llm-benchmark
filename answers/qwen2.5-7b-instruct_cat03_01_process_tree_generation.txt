To model the described hospital patient management scenario using the given process tree operators, we will break down the process into its constituent parts and then construct the process tree. Here is the step-by-step construction:

1. **Arrival (A) and Registration (RG)**:
   - `A` (Arrival) should be followed by `RG` (Registration).
   - `A -> RG`

2. **Intake Assessment (IA)**:
   - `IA` happens after `RG`.
   - `RG -> IA`

3. **Triage Evaluation**:
   - The triage involves a sequence of `TI` (Triage Interview) and `TC` (Triage Classification).
   - `TI` -> `TC`
   - `IA` -> `TI -> TC`

4. **Initial Diagnostic Test (CE or FBP)**:
   - This step is an exclusive choice between `CE` (Comprehensive ECG) and `FBP` (Full Blood Panel).
   - `X(CE, FBP)`
   - `TC -> X(CE, FBP)`

5. **RDT Loop**:
   - The loop involves `SC` (Specialist Consultation), `TM` (Targeted Medication) or `SPT` (Specialized Physical Therapy), and `RDT` (Re-Diagnostic Test).
   - The loop condition is that if `RDT` results are abnormal, the loop repeats.
   - `SC -> X(TM, SPT) -> RDT` (loop step)
   - `RDT` should be executed multiple times until results are normal.
   - `* (SC -> X(TM, SPT) -> RDT)`

6. **Advanced Diagnostic Imaging and Lifestyle Support**:
   - `AI` (Advanced Imaging) and `NC` (Nutritional Counseling) are done in true concurrency.
   - `+ (AI, NC)`
   - `RDT -> X(FCE, FBA) -> + (AI, NC)`

7. **Final Administrative and Informational Steps**:
   - `FAS` (Follow-up Appointment Scheduling), `DDI` (Detailed Discharge Instructions), `BL` (Billing), `ICP` (Insurance Claims Processing), and `MRF` (Medical Records Finalization) are done in true concurrency.
   - `+ (FAS, DDI, BL, ICP, MRF)`

Putting it all together, the process tree will look like this:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Root process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Arrival and Registration
A = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, label="A", parent=root)
RG = ProcessTree(label="RG", parent=A)
IA = ProcessTree(label="IA", parent=A)
A.children.append(RG)
A.children.append(IA)

# Intake Assessment
TI = ProcessTree(label="TI", parent=IA)
TC = ProcessTree(label="TC", parent=IA)
IA.children.append(TI)
IA.children.append(TC)

# Triage Evaluation
triage_eval = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, label="TC", parent=root)
triage_eval.children.append(TI)
triage_eval.children.append(TC)
root.children.append(triage_eval)

# Initial Diagnostic Test (Exclusive Choice)
initial_test = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, label="X(CE, FBP)", parent=root)
CE = ProcessTree(label="CE", parent=initial_test)
FBP = ProcessTree(label="FBP", parent=initial_test)
initial_test.children.append(CE)
initial_test.children.append(FBP)
root.children.append(initial_test)

# RDT Loop
rdt_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, label="* (SC -> X(TM, SPT) -> RDT)", parent=root)
SC = ProcessTree(label="SC", parent=rdt_loop)
TM = ProcessTree(label="TM", parent=rdt_loop)
SPT = ProcessTree(label="SPT", parent=rdt_loop)
RDT = ProcessTree(label="RDT", parent=rdt_loop)
rdt_loop.children.append(SC)
rdt_loop.children.append(X(TM, SPT))
rdt_loop.children.append(RDT)
root.children.append(rdt_loop)

# Advanced Diagnostic Imaging and Lifestyle Support
advanced_tests = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, label="RDT -> X(FCE, FBA) -> + (AI, NC)", parent=root)
AI = ProcessTree(label="AI", parent=advanced_tests)
NC = ProcessTree(label="NC", parent=advanced_tests)
RDT.children.append(AI)
RDT.children.append(NC)

# Final Administrative and Informational Steps
admin_info = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, label="+ (FAS, DDI, BL, ICP, MRF)", parent=root)
FAS = ProcessTree(label="FAS", parent=admin_info)
DDI = ProcessTree(label="DDI", parent=admin_info)
BL = ProcessTree(label="BL", parent=admin_info)
ICP = ProcessTree(label="ICP", parent=admin_info)
MRF = ProcessTree(label="MRF", parent=admin_info)
admin_info.children.append(FAS)
admin_info.children.append/DDI)
admin_info.children.append(BL)
admin_info.children.append(ICP)
admin_info.children.append(MRF)
root.children.append(admin_info)

# Display the process tree
print(root)
```

This Python code constructs the process tree for the whole hospital patient management scenario using the defined operators and notation. Each process step is represented as a node in the process tree, and the relationships between these steps are defined using the sequence (`->`), exclusive choice (`X`), loop (`*`), and true concurrency (`+`) operators.
