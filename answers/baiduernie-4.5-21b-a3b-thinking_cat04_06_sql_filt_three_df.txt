<think>
We are going to break down the problem into steps:

 Step 1: Identify cases that have the sequence:
   'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'
   with no events in between (so consecutive) and in the exact order.

 However, note that we are asked to exclude these cases from the final result.

 But the problem also says: return all events from cases that do not meet the criteria (i.e., the cases that have the sequence and the timing condition are excluded).

 Approach:

 We can first find the cases that have the sequence and the timing condition (more than 5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order').

 Then, we want to exclude those cases.

 However, note: the problem says "exclude them from your final result", meaning we do not want any event from a case that has the sequence and the timing condition.

 But note: the problem also says "return all events from cases that do not meet the above criteria".

 So, we can do:

   - First, create a CTE (or subquery) that identifies the cases that have the specific sequence and the timing condition.

   - Then, we want to return all events that are not in those cases.

 However, note: the sequence must be consecutive. So we cannot have any event from the same case in between.

 How to capture the sequence?

 We can use window functions to look for the next event in the same case? But note: we are only concerned with the immediate next event? Actually, the problem says "in direct succession" and "no other event in between".

 So, for a given case, we want to find three consecutive events that match the sequence.

 We can do:

   - For each case, we can look at every set of three consecutive events? But note: the events might not be consecutive in the entire log, but we require that between the three events there are no other events of the same case. So we can use lag or lead? Alternatively, we can use self-join or interval based.

 However, DuckDB has a function called `lead` or `lag` but we need to check the exact next one. We can use:

   - First, we can assign an order within each case by `timestamp` (but note: we must consider the exact sequence of activities, so we cannot rely on the order by timestamp alone because the same case might have events in different order? But the problem states the sequence, so we assume the events for a case are recorded in the order of occurrence? We'll use the timestamp order).

 Step 1a: Create a ranked list of events per case by timestamp.

 Step 1b: For each case, we can check for every set of three consecutive events (by the order in the case) if:

   - The first of the three is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   - The second is 'Create Order'
   - The third is 'Confirm Order'

 Step 1c: Also, for the second and third event, we need to check the time difference is more than 5 days.

 But note: the problem says "between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event", so we are only concerned with the two events.

 However, we are only looking for consecutive events? So the time between the second and third event (which are consecutive) must be more than 5 days.

 But note: the entire sequence of three must be consecutive. So we are only concerned with the two events being consecutive? Yes, because the sequence is three consecutive events.

 So, for each case, we can:

   - Use window functions to get the next event after 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and then the next after that? Actually, we can do:

   - Assign a row number per case by timestamp.

   - Then, for each row, we can get the next two events? But we are only interested in the sequence starting with 'Approve Purchase Requisition'.

 Alternatively, we can use:

   - First, find the row with 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and then check the next event (by timestamp) is 'Create Order' and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'. And then check the time difference between the second and third is more than 5 days.

 But note: what if the same case has multiple such sequences? We don't care, we just need to know that the case has at least one.

 Step 2: We will create a CTE to mark the cases that have the sequence and the timing condition.

 Let's design:

   WITH sequence_cases AS (
     SELECT
        case_id
     FROM (
        SELECT
           case_id,
           activity,
           timestamp,
           LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
           LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp,
           LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
           LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
        FROM event_log
     ) AS ranked
     WHERE
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND prev_activity = 'Create Order'   -- This would be the immediate previous? But note: we want the immediate next to be 'Create Order'. Actually, we want:
        -- Actually, we want: 
        --   The event at time T1: 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        --   The next event at time T2: 'Create Order'
        --   The next event at time T3: 'Confirm Order'
        -- But note: the previous of the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' might not be the one we care about. Instead, we can check the next events.

     We can change: we are interested in the event that is 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and then the next two events.

     So we can do:

        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

        AND the time between the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and 'Create Order' is immediate? Actually, the problem says no event in between. But note: we are using the lead for the next event and then the one after that. However, the condition above does not check that there is nothing in between? Actually, by the window function, the next event is the immediate next? So that's the next event by timestamp? But what if there is an event from a different case? That doesn't matter because we are per case. And the problem says "no other event from the same case in between", so within the same case, the next two events must be the ones we are looking for.

     However, note: the events in the same case are ordered by timestamp, so the next two events (by timestamp) in the same case after the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' must be the next two. But what if there is an event from a different case in between? That doesn't affect the same case. We are only concerned with events in the same case.

     So we can do:

        WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
          AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
          AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

     And then we also need the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' to be more than 5 days? But note: the timing condition is between the second and third event (which are consecutive). The second event is the 'Create Order' and the third is the 'Confirm Order'. So we can check:

        AND (next_timestamp - next_next_timestamp) > 5 days

     But note: the time difference should be more than 5 days, so we can do:

        AND (next_timestamp - next_next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

     However, DuckDB stores timestamps in a format that we can subtract and get an interval? We can use:

        AND (next_timestamp - next_next_timestamp) > 5 * INTERVAL '1 day'

     Or we can use:

        AND (next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days')

     But note: the condition for the sequence requires that the three events are consecutive. The window function we used gets the immediate next two. So if the condition on the activities is met and the time between the second and third is more than 5 days, then we mark the case.

     However, what if the sequence is broken? For example, if the next event is not the immediate next? Actually, the window function gets the next event by timestamp. So if there is an event in between, then the next_activity would be that event, not the one we want. So we are safe.

     But note: what if the same activity appears twice? We are only looking at the immediate next? So if the sequence is:

        ... 'Approve Purchase Requisition' ... then an event 'SomethingElse' ... then 'Create Order' ... then ... 'Confirm Order'

     Then the immediate next after 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is 'SomethingElse', so we skip.

 Step 3: Then we can create a CTE that selects the case_ids that have at least one occurrence of such a sequence.

     So:

        WITH sequence_cases AS (
            SELECT DISTINCT case_id
            FROM (
                ... the above ranked window ...
            ) AS ranked
            WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
              AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
              AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
              AND (next_timestamp - next_next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
        )

     But note: we are using the window functions LAG and LEAD. We are getting:

        prev_activity: the activity of the previous event in the same case (by timestamp)
        prev_timestamp: the timestamp of the previous event
        next_activity: the next event's activity
        next_timestamp: the timestamp of the next event

     But note: the window function is defined over the entire set per case, ordered by timestamp.

     However, for the first event in a case, the LAG might be null, and for the last, the LEAD might be null. So we must make sure we are only looking at events that have the next two events.

     We can add:

        AND next_activity IS NOT NULL
        AND next_next_activity IS NOT NULL

     But the condition above (where we look for the specific activities) would fail anyway if they are null.

 Step 4: Now, we want to exclude these cases. So we want to return all events that are NOT in the set of cases in sequence_cases.

     However, note: the problem says "return all events from cases that do not meet the above criteria", meaning we want to exclude the cases that have the sequence and the timing condition.

     So we can do:

        SELECT *
        FROM event_log
        WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)

     But note: what if there are multiple events in the same case? We are excluding the entire case.

     This is what we want: if a case has the sequence (with the timing condition), we exclude every event of that case.

 Step 5: Ordering? The problem says "ensuring proper grouping, ordering, and filtering". We are not explicitly required to order, but we can order by case_id and timestamp for clarity.

 However, note: the problem does not specify an order, so we can just return the events without a specific order? But let's order by case_id and timestamp so it's easier to read.

 But note: the problem says "return all events from cases that do not meet the above criteria", so we are returning the entire event_log except the events from the excluded cases.

 Step 6: But wait, what if the sequence appears multiple times in the same case? We are using DISTINCT case_id in the CTE, so we mark the case only once. That's okay.

 Step 7: However, note: the condition for the timing is only about the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' being more than 5 days apart. We are checking that in the same CTE where we check the sequence. So we are good.

 But note: what if the same case has the sequence twice? We still mark it once and exclude all events of that case.

 Step 8: Let's write the full query.

 However, note: the window function approach might not be the most efficient? But for DuckDB, we can use window functions.

 But there is an alternative: we can use self-join. We can join the event_log table with itself.

 Alternative approach:

   We can look for a case that has:

      event1: 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      event2: 'Create Order'
      event3: 'Confirm Order'

   such that:

      event2.timestamp - event1.timestamp > 0 (meaning not same time, but we don't need that explicitly because we are looking for consecutive) and event3.timestamp - event2.timestamp > 5 days.

   And also, there should be no event between event1 and event2? And between event2 and event3? Actually, the consecutive condition is taken care of by the fact that we are matching by the exact activity and the time order? But we must ensure that there are no events in between? How?

   We can do:

      SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id
      FROM event_log e1
      JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
      JOIN event_log e3 ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
      WHERE 
          e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
          AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
          AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
          AND (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp) > 0   -- but we don't care about the gap between e1 and e2? Actually, we require that e2 is the next event? Not exactly, because there might be an event from a different case? No, we are per case. But we require that there is nothing in between? Actually, if we join in the same case, we are not controlling the order? We are only controlling the timestamp being greater. But we need to ensure that there is no event in between? How?

   We can do:

      ... AND e2.timestamp = (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log e4 WHERE e4.case_id = e1.case_id AND e4.timestamp > e1.timestamp)

   Then similarly for e3? That might be heavy.

   The window function approach is simpler.

   Let me stick with the window function.

 Step 9: The window function approach must be done per case and ordered by timestamp.

   We'll use:

        WITH windowed_events AS (
            SELECT
                case_id,
                activity,
                timestamp,
                LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
                LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
                LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
                LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
            FROM event_log
        )
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM windowed_events
        WHERE 
            activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
            AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
            AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
            AND next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'

   But note: the LEAD function for next_next_activity and next_next_timestamp gives the next two events. However, if there are less than 3 events in the case, then these leads will be null. So we must avoid those.

   We can add:

        AND next_activity IS NOT NULL
        AND next_next_activity IS NOT NULL
        AND next_timestamp IS NOT NULL
        AND next_next_timestamp IS NOT NULL

   But the condition above (the activity names) would fail if they are null.

 Step 10: Now, we build the CTE and then exclude.

   However, note: performance? We are scanning each case and each event. But if the table is large, we need to be cautious. But the problem does not specify size.

   We'll go with the window function.

 Final Query:

   WITH windowed_events AS (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
        FROM event_log
    ),
    sequence_cases AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM windowed_events
        WHERE 
            activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
            AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
            AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
            AND next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
            -- We don't need the null checks because if any of the leads are null, the conditions above would fail (since we are matching with string names)
    )
    SELECT *
    FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)
    ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

 But note: the problem says "more than 5 days". The condition `next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'` is correct? Let me check:

   Let A = next_timestamp (for 'Create Order')
   Let B = next_next_timestamp (for 'Confirm Order')

   We want B - A > 5 days.

   But in DuckDB, subtracting two timestamps gives an interval. We can compare intervals? We can do:

        AND (next_next_timestamp - INTERVAL '5 days') > next_timestamp

   But that is equivalent to: next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'

   Alternatively, we can do:

        AND next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'

   This is more straightforward.

   So let me change:

        AND next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'

 Step 11: What if the timestamps are in different time zones? We assume they are consistent.

 Step 12: Also note: the problem says "direct succession" meaning consecutive? We are using LEAD to get the next two events, so we are effectively skipping any events in between? Yes, because the next event by timestamp is the immediate next? But what if the same case has two events at the same timestamp? Then the ordering by timestamp is unstable? We must break ties.

   We can add:

        ... ORDER BY timestamp, activity ...   in the window function? Actually, we don't control the tie-breaking for the same timestamp. But the problem says "no other event from the same case in between", so if there are two events at the same time? Then they are not in between? But they are at the same time? We must assume that the events are uniquely ordered by timestamp? Or we need to break ties arbitrarily? 

   However, the problem does not specify. To be safe, we can break ties by the natural order of events? But we don't have an event_id. Alternatively, we can order by timestamp and then by activity? But that might not be safe.

   But note: the sequence we are looking for has distinct activities? So if two events are at the same time, they cannot be the next two in the sequence? So we can assume that the same case does not have two events at the same time? Or if it does, then we can break arbitrarily? But the problem does not specify.

   Let's assume the events for a case are uniquely ordered by timestamp.

   If there are ties, then the LEAD function will return null for the next events if there are multiple at the same time? Actually, if there are multiple events at the same timestamp for the same case, then the LEAD function will return the next distinct timestamp? Or it will return the next event by the order we specify? The documentation says: if there are ties, then the values will be arbitrary? So we must ensure we have a unique order.

   We can add a tie-breaker:

        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp, activity) AS next_activity,

   But note: the activity might be the same? Not in our sequence? The sequence we are looking for has distinct activities. But for other cases? We don't care? We are only looking for the sequence.

   However, to be safe, we can use:

        ORDER BY timestamp, activity, ...? We don't have an event_id. So we can only use the available columns.

   Since we don't have an event_id, we cannot break ties arbitrarily? But we are only concerned with the sequence of three specific activities. So if there are two events at the same time, one of them might break our sequence? 

   But the problem says "no other event from the same case in between", so if two events happen at the same time, then they are both at the same moment? Then the sequence condition would fail? Because the next event would be at the same time? So we would not get a consecutive event? 

   So we can assume that the events for a case are uniquely timestamped? The problem does not specify, but we'll assume that.

   Alternatively, we can use min(timestamp) or max(timestamp) but that might not be safe.

   We'll proceed without a tie-breaker.

 Step 13: Also, note: what if the sequence spans across days? We are only concerned with the time between the two events? So the condition on the timing is absolute.

 Step 14: Final query.

   We'll write:

        WITH windowed_events AS (
            SELECT
                case_id,
                activity,
                timestamp,
                LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
                LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
                LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
                LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
            FROM event_log
        ),
        sequence_cases AS (
            SELECT DISTINCT case_id
            FROM windowed_events
            WHERE 
                activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
                AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
                AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
                AND next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'
        )
        SELECT e.*
        FROM event_log e
        LEFT JOIN sequence_cases s ON e.case_id = s.case_id
        WHERE s.case_id IS NULL
        ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;

   Alternatively, we can use:

        WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)

   But the LEFT JOIN approach is more common and might be more efficient? Also, it avoids the problem of NULLs in the case_id (if the subquery returns NULL, but our case_ids are not null).

   However, we can also do:

        WITH ... as above ...
        SELECT *
        FROM event_log
        WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)

   But note: if the sequence_cases CTE returns a NULL case_id? It shouldn't because we are selecting from event_log which has non-null case_id? And our conditions are on non-null activities? So case_id is not null.

   We'll use the NOT IN.

   However, the problem says "proper grouping, ordering, and filtering". We are ordering by case_id and timestamp.

   Let me write the final query.

   But note: the window function CTE is called `windowed_events`, and then `sequence_cases` uses that.

   We can also avoid the DISTINCT in the sequence_cases by using GROUP BY case_id? But DISTINCT is fine.

   We'll do:

        WITH windowed_events AS (
            SELECT
                case_id,
                activity,
                timestamp,
                LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
                LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
                LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
                LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
            FROM event_log
        ),
        sequence_cases AS (
            SELECT case_id
            FROM windowed_events
            WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
              AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
              AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
              AND next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'
            GROUP BY case_id   -- Group by case_id to remove duplicates? Actually, the same case might appear multiple times? But we are only interested once. So group by case_id.
        )
        SELECT *
        FROM event_log
        WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)
        ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

   Why group by case_id? Because if the same case appears multiple times in the windowed_events (which it will, once per event) but we are only interested in the sequence once? And we are filtering by the sequence conditions. So the same case might be reported multiple times? We can use GROUP BY to deduplicate.

   Alternatively, we can use DISTINCT in the select of sequence_cases. Both are fine.

   We'll use GROUP BY for clarity.

 Step 15: Test the query with some sample data? We don't have sample data, so we hope it's correct.

   Let me note: the condition on the timing: we are using `next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'`

   This is correct.

   Now, we return the entire event_log for cases that are not in sequence_cases.

   This meets the requirement.

   But note: what if the case has the sequence but the time difference is <=5 days? Then it is included in the sequence_cases? No, because we require the time difference to be more than 5 days? So if the time difference is <=5 days, then we do not mark the case? Then we include the events of that case.

   But the problem says: "exclude them from your final result" meaning only if they have the sequence AND the timing condition? So if they have the sequence but the timing condition is not met (time <=5 days), then we do not exclude.

   Our condition in the sequence_cases requires both: the sequence and the timing condition. So we are good.

   Therefore, the final query:

        WITH windowed_events AS (
            SELECT
                case_id,
                activity,
                timestamp,
                LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
                LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
                LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
                LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
            FROM event_log
        ),
        sequence_cases AS (
            SELECT case_id
            FROM windowed_events
            WHERE 
                activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
                AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
                AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
                AND next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'
            GROUP BY case_id
        )
        SELECT e.*
        FROM event_log e
        WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)
        ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;

   We'll write it accordingly.

   Note: The INTERVAL '5 days' must be the same as the date unit in DuckDB? Yes, we can use INTERVAL '5' DAY? Or we can write '5 days'. The documentation says we can write:

        INTERVAL '5 days'

   So we are safe.

   Let me run through an example:

        case_id: C1
        Event1: (ts1) 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        Event2: (ts2) 'Create Order'   -> next_timestamp = ts2
        Event3: (ts3) 'Confirm Order'   -> next_next_timestamp = ts3

        Condition: 
            activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> true
            next_activity = 'Create Order' -> true
            next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order' -> true
            AND ts3 > ts2 + INTERVAL '5 days' -> true, then mark case C1.

        Then we exclude all events of C1.

   Another example:

        case_id: C2
        Event1: (ts1) 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        Event2: (ts2) 'Create Order'
        Event3: (ts3) 'Confirm Order'
        but ts3 - ts2 <= 5 days -> then not marked.

        Then we include events of C2.

   Another example:

        case_id: C3
        Event1: (ts1) 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        Event2: (ts2) 'Create Order'
        Event3: (ts3) 'Something Else'
        Event4: (ts4) 'Confirm Order'

        Then the next_activity after 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is 'Create Order' (good) but the next_next_activity is 'Something Else', so it fails.

        Then not marked.

   Another example: multiple sequences in one case? But we are grouping by case_id so it's marked once.

   So the query should be correct.

   We'll now write the query.

</think>

To solve this problem, we need to identify and exclude cases (process instances) that contain a specific sequence of three consecutive activities with a time gap of more than 5 days between the second and third activities. The final result should include all events from cases that do not meet these criteria.

### Approach
1. **Identify the Specific Sequence**: For each case, check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive activities:
   - 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   - 'Create Order'
   - 'Confirm Order'
2. **Check Time Gap**: Ensure the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. **Filter Cases**: Collect all case IDs that meet both the sequence and timing conditions.
4. **Exclude Cases**: Return all events from cases not present in the filtered list.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH windowed_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM windowed_events
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation
1. **windowed_events CTE**:
   - For each event in the `event_log`, we use window functions to capture:
     - The next activity (`LEAD(activity, 1)`) and the activity after that (`LEAD(activity, 2)`).
     - The timestamp of the next activity (`LEAD(timestamp, 1)`) and the timestamp after that (`LEAD(timestamp, 2)`).
   - This sets up a sequence of events per case ordered by their timestamps.

2. **sequence_cases CTE**:
   - We filter events to find sequences where:
     - The current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'.
     - The next activity is 'Create Order'.
     - The activity after the next is 'Confirm Order'.
   - Additionally, we ensure the time gap between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days using `next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'`.
   - We use `DISTINCT` to list unique case IDs that meet these conditions.

3. **Final Query**:
   - Exclude cases identified in `sequence_cases` using `NOT IN`.
   - Return all events from the remaining cases, ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity.

This approach efficiently filters out unwanted cases by leveraging window functions to check sequences and time gaps, ensuring the result meets the specified criteria.
