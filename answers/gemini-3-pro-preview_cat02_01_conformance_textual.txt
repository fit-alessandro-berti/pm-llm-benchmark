Based on the normative process description provided, I have analyzed the event log.

The following cases deviate from the intended process flow: **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5**.

Below is the detailed explanation of the violations for each deviating case.

### **Case 2: Violation of Activity Ordering**
*   **Sequence Recorded:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ **Package items** $\rightarrow$ **Authorize payment** $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.
*   **The Violation:**
    The normative description explicitly states that "Authorize payment" must ensure the payment method is valid *before* items are prepared. It defines the constraint: *"Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping."*
*   **Explanation:**
    In Case 2, the items were packaged at 10:00, but the payment was not authorized until 10:30. This violates the rule that packaging must wait for payment authorization. This is a risky deviation because the company might waste resources packaging an order for a customer who cannot pay.

### **Case 3: Violation of Logic and Cancellation Rules**
*   **Sequence Recorded:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ **Cancel order** $\rightarrow$ **Ship order** $\rightarrow$ Close order.
*   **The Violation:**
    This case commits a critical logic error. The description states: *"Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment... such as shipping."* Furthermore, it explicitly sets the constraint: *"Ship order should... never after a cancellation."*
*   **Explanation:**
    Case 3 proceeds to "Ship order" at 10:30 after having already recorded "Cancel order" at 10:00. Shipping a canceled item is a severe process failure (resulting in loss of inventory without revenue). Additionally, while the text implies a branch (either Authorize OR Cancel), this case attempts to do both (Authorize, then Cancel), which creates an ambiguous flow, but the shipping-after-cancellation is the definitive violation.

### **Case 5: Violation of Mandatory Steps (Missing Activity)**
*   **Sequence Recorded:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ **Ship order** $\rightarrow$ Close order.
*   **The Violation:**
    The process description outlines a strict dependency: *"Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'."*
*   **Explanation:**
    In Case 5, the "Package items" activity is completely missing. The process jumps directly from "Authorize payment" (10:30) to "Ship order" (11:00). According to the normative text, shipping cannot occur until the items are packaged. Skipping the packaging step violates the requirement that items must be prepared before shipment.

### **Summary of Compliant Cases**
For clarity, here is why the other cases are correct:
*   **Case 1:** Follows the perfect "Sufficient Inventory" flow (Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Authorize $\rightarrow$ Package $\rightarrow$ Ship $\rightarrow$ Close).
*   **Case 4:** Follows the perfect "Insufficient Inventory" flow (Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Cancel $\rightarrow$ Close).
