Let's analyze each case in the event log against the provided normative process description.

The core principles and sequences are:
*   **Always starts with:** "Receive order"
*   **"Check inventory" placement:** Must occur after "Receive order" and before "Authorize payment" or "Cancel order."
*   **Sufficient Inventory Path:** Receive -> Check -> Authorize Payment -> Package -> Ship -> Close
*   **Insufficient Inventory Path:** Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close
*   **Key Constraints/Violations:**
    *   "Authorize payment" only after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."
    *   "Package items" only after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
    *   "Ship order" only after "Package items" and *never* after a "Cancel order."
    *   "Close order" is always the final activity.

We don't have information about the outcome of the "Check inventory" (i.e., whether inventory was sufficient or not), so we must infer the intended path based on subsequent activities. If "Authorize payment" or "Package items" occurs, we assume inventory was sufficient. If "Cancel order" occurs, we assume inventory was insufficient.

**Analysis of Cases:**

**Case 1:**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Starts with "Receive order": Yes.
    *   "Check inventory" before "Authorize payment": Yes.
    *   "Authorize payment" before "Package items": Yes.
    *   "Package items" before "Ship order": Yes.
    *   "Ship order" not after "Cancel order": Yes (no cancel).
    *   "Close order" is final: Yes.
    *   This sequence matches the "Sufficient Inventory Path" perfectly.
*   **Violation:** None. This case conforms to the normative process.

**Case 2:**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Starts with "Receive order": Yes.
    *   "Check inventory" before "Package items": Yes.
    *   "Authorize payment" after "Check inventory": Yes.
    *   **Violation:** The description explicitly states: "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" **and before packaging**. Here, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." This violates the expectation that payment authorization precedes preparation for shipment. The rule "Package items" should only occur after authorization is also violated.
    *   "Package items" before "Ship order": Yes.
    *   "Ship order" not after "Cancel order": Yes (no cancel).
    *   "Close order" is final: Yes.
*   **Violation:** **Yes.**
    *   **Rule Violated:** "Authorize payment" occurred *after* "Package items". The normative description states, "'Package items' should only occur after authorization," and "Authorize payment" should occur "before packaging".

**Case 3:**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Starts with "Receive order": Yes.
    *   "Check inventory" before "Authorize payment": Yes.
    *   **Violation:** "Authorize payment" occurred. This implies sufficient inventory. However, subsequently, "Cancel order" occurs. The normative description states that *if* inventory is insufficient, the process *must* branch to "Cancel order" *after checking inventory*. It also implies that if inventory *is* sufficient, the process follows the fulfillment path, not cancellation. Performing "Authorize payment" and then "Cancel order" is contradictory to the described branching logic.
    *   **Violation:** "Ship order" occurred *after* "Cancel order." The description clearly states, "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)," and "Ship order" should "never after a cancellation."
    *   "Close order" is final: Yes.
*   **Violation:** **Yes.**
    *   **Rule Violated (1):** Contradictory activities for inventory status: "Authorize payment" (implies sufficient inventory) followed by "Cancel order" (implies insufficient inventory). While not explicitly stated as a direct violation, it contradicts the described branching logic. The process should follow *either* the fulfillment path *or* the cancellation path based on the inventory check outcome.
    *   **Rule Violated (2):** "Ship order" occurred *after* "Cancel order." This is explicitly forbidden: "'Ship order' should... never after a cancellation."

**Case 4:**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Starts with "Receive order": Yes.
    *   "Check inventory" before "Cancel order": Yes.
    *   "Cancel order" followed by "Close order": Yes.
    *   This sequence matches the "Insufficient Inventory Path" perfectly.
*   **Violation:** None. This case conforms to the normative process.

**Case 5:**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Starts with "Receive order": Yes.
    *   "Check inventory" before "Authorize payment": Yes.
    *   **Violation:** "Package items" is missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." The normative description states, "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" It also lists "Package items" as a mandatory step in the "Sufficient Inventory Path."
    *   "Ship order" not after "Cancel order": Yes (no cancel).
    *   "Close order" is final: Yes.
*   **Violation:** **Yes.**
    *   **Rule Violated:** Missing "Package items" activity. The description implies that "Package items" is a necessary prerequisite for "Ship order" in the fulfillment path ("Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'").

**Summary of Deviations:**

*   **Case 1:** Conforms.
*   **Case 2:** **Deviates.** Violation: "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment." The normative description states "Authorize payment should...before packaging" and "'Package items' should only occur after authorization."
*   **Case 3:** **Deviates.**
    *   Violation 1: "Authorize payment" followed by "Cancel order," which is contradictory to the described branching based on inventory. An order should either be fulfilled or canceled, not both.
    *   Violation 2: "Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order," which is explicitly forbidden ("'Ship order' should... never after a cancellation.").
*   **Case 4:** Conforms.
*   **Case 5:** **Deviates.** Violation: "Package items" activity was skipped. The normative process dictates that "Package items" must occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order" in the fulfillment path.
