**Solution:**

### Normative Rule Violations:

**Case 2:**
- **Violation:** Risk Assessment before Credit Check.
  - **Reason:** The sequence is violated as the credit check, a mandatory activity before risk assessment, was not performed first.

**Case 2:**
- **Violation:** Finalizing documentation after a loan rejection.
  - **Reason:** This step should not occur if the loan is rejected. Finalizing documentation is only appropriate after a positive loan decision.

### Desiderata Violations:

**Case 1:**
- **Desideratum Violation:** Inform Applicant within 48 hours of the loan decision.
  - **Reason:** The applicant was informed 4 hours after the loan decision, which is not within the recommended 48-hour window.

**Case 3:**
- **Desideratum Violation:** Credit Check more than 24 hours after Application Received.
  - **Reason:** The credit check took place 2 days after the application was received, violating the preference for timely processing.

**Case 3:**
- **Desideratum Violation:** Inform Applicant more than 48 hours after loan decision.
  - **Reason:** The applicant was informed 2 days after the loan decision, exceeding the recommended time frame.

**Case 3:**
- **Desideratum Violation:** Lack of Follow-up Call before closing the case.
  - **Reason:** While not a strict rule, a follow-up call was not made, which is a best practice encouraged but not mandated.

### Interpretations or Justifications:

- **Case 2:** The Credit Check and Risk Assessment were reversed due to a procedural oversight or misunderstanding of the required sequence. Once identified, it can be corrected in subsequent cases.

- **Case 2:** Finalizing documentation after a rejection might indicate an error in processing logic, possibly due to a human oversight. Implementing checks to ensure that documentation is only finalized for approved loans can prevent this issue.

- **Case 1:** The delay in informing the applicant suggests that communication channels might have been overwhelmed or mismanaged, leading to a slower response than ideal.

- **Case 3:** The late Credit Check and Inform Applicant actions may point to understaffing, equipment issues, or high case volumes that temporarily slowed down processing times. Streamlining operations or increasing resources during peak periods can help mitigate these delays.

- **Case 3:** The absence of a follow-up call might be due to routine oversight, as it is not a strict requirement but rather an additional step for confirmation and alignment. Including this as part of standard post-decision procedures could rectify this oversight.

By addressing these deviations and interpreting them within the context of resource availability, training needs, and process improvements, the loan application process can be optimized to better align with both its normative rules and recommended best practices.
