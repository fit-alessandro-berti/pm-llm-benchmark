**Naming Justifications:**

1. **Verify Identity Docs** - Renamed to clarify that this step specifically involves identity documents, distinguishing it from other verification activities like physical documents.  
   
2. **Request Missing Docs** - Renamed to reflect the action of requesting additional documents when initial verification is incomplete, highlighting the need for customer action.   

3. **Upload ID Scan** - Renamed to specify the action taken by the customer, making it clear that the customer is providing the necessary documentation.  

4. **Re-Verify Documents** - Renamed to emphasize the need for a second check on the documents after additional information (ID scan) is provided, establishing a clear sequence of verification steps.  

5. **Clarify Account Issue** - Renamed to indicate the purpose of the call made to the customer, focusing on resolving account-related discrepancies.  

6. **Adjust Account Internally** - Renamed to describe the internal action taken by the back-office agent after customer communication, ensuring clarity on the nature of the adjustment.  

7. **Confirm Adjustments** - Renamed to convey the purpose of the follow-up call, which is to ensure that the account adjustments have been made correctly.  

8. **Verify Physical Docs** - Renamed to specify that the verification process in this step is physical, distinguishing it from other document verifications that may be digital or online.  

9. **Recall Customer** - Renamed to capture the action of calling back the customer who left the branch, indicating a need for customer presence for further processing.  

10. **Internal Account Adjust** - Renamed to clarify that the adjustment is made internally by the back-office agent due to missing information, separating it from adjustments requested by the customer.  

11. **Re-Verify Post-Adjustment** - Renamed to highlight the need for a secondary verification process after an account adjustment has been made, ensuring that changes are reflected accurately in the documentation.
