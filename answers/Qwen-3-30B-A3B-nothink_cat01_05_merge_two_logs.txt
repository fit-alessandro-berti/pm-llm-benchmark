# Merged Event Log: Integration of Log A and Log B

---

##  **Objective**

Merge **Log A (System A)** and **Log B (System B)** into a single, enriched event log by aligning events based on:

- **Order ID**
- **Event timing** (with a 2-second tolerance)
- **Event semantics** (matching event types by meaning, not just name)

---

##  **Approach**

1. **Align events** by **order_id** and **time proximity** (within ±2 seconds).
2. **Map event types** based on semantic similarity:
   - `Order Received`  `OrderReceived`
   - `Order Validated`  `OrderValidation`
   - `Payment Processed`  `PaymentCheck`
   - `Item Shipped`  `Shipping`
3. **Merge attributes** from both logs where events match.
4. **Keep non-matching events** as separate records, noting their origin.
5. **Sort** the final log by **timestamp**.

##  **Matching and Merging Summary**

| Log A Event | Log B Event | Matched? | Reason |
|-------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| `Order Received` | `OrderReceived` |  | Matched by semantic similarity and time within 2s |
| `Order Validated` | `OrderValidation` |  | Matched by semantic similarity and time within 2s |
| `Payment Processed` | `PaymentCheck` |  | Matched by semantic similarity and time within 2s |
| `Item Shipped` | `Shipping` |  | Matched by semantic similarity and time within 2s |
| `Item Delivered` | No match |  | No corresponding event in Log B |

| Log B Event | Log A Event | Matched? | Reason |
|-------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| `Quality Check` | No match |  | No corresponding event in Log A |
| `OrderReceived` | `Order Received` |  | Matched by semantic similarity and time within 2s |
| `OrderValidation` | `Order Validated` |  | Matched by semantic similarity and time within 2s |
| `PaymentCheck` | `Payment Processed` |  | Matched by semantic similarity and time within 2s |
| `Shipping` | `Item Shipped` |  | Matched by semantic similarity and time within 2s |

##  **Merged Event Log (Chronological Order)**

### 1. **Order Received (Log A + Log B)**
- **Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z (Log B)
- **Event Type**: `Order Received`
- **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
- **Attributes**:
  - `event_type`: `Order Received`
  - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z`
  - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
  - `user_id`: `u45`
  - `resource_id`: `r10`
  - `notes`: `"Event captured at warehouse system"`

### 2. **Order Validated (Log A + Log B)**
- **Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z (Log B)
- **Event Type**: `Order Validated`
- **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
- **Attributes**:
  - `event_type`: `Order Validated`
  - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z`
  - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
  - `user_id`: `u12`
  - `resource_id`: `r10`
  - `notes`: `"Cross-check inventory"`

### 3. **Payment Processed (Log A + Log B)**
- **Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z (Log A)
- **Event Type**: `Payment Processed`
- **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
- **Attributes**:
  - `event_type`: `Payment Processed`
  - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z`
  - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
  - `user_id`: `u12`
  - `resource_id`: `r99`
  - `notes`: `"Payment gateway delay"`

### 4. **Quality Check (Log B only)**
- **Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z
- **Event Type**: `Quality Check`
- **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
- **Attributes**:
  - `event_type`: `Quality Check`
  - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z`
  - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
  - `user_id`: `u45`
  - `resource_id`: `r11`
  - `notes`: `"Random inspection"`
- **Origin**: Log B

### 5. **Item Shipped (Log A + Log B)**
- **Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z (Log A)
- **Event Type**: `Item Shipped`
- **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
- **Attributes**:
  - `event_type`: `Item Shipped`
  - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z`
  - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
  - `user_id`: `u45`
  - `resource_id`: `r10`
  - `notes`: `"Package handed to courier"`

### 6. **Item Delivered (Log A only)**
- **Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z
- **Event Type**: `Item Delivered`
- **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
- **Attributes**:
  - `event_type`: `Item Delivered`
  - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z`
  - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
- **Origin**: Log A

---

##  **Final Chronological Order**

1. **Order Received** (Log A + Log B)  
2. **Order Validated** (Log A + Log B)  
3. **Payment Processed** (Log A + Log B)  
4. **Quality Check** (Log B only)  
5. **Item Shipped** (Log A + Log B)  
6. **Item Delivered** (Log A only)

---

##  **Reasoning and Conflict Resolution**

- **Timestamp Matching**: Used a **2-second tolerance** to account for minor time differences between systems (e.g., Log A’s `Order Received` at 10:00:00 vs. Log B’s `OrderReceived` at 09:59:58).
- **Event Name Mapping**: Matched event types by **semantic similarity** (e.g., `OrderReceived`  `Order Received`).
- **Attribute Enrichment**: Merged attributes from both logs where events matched. For example, `user_id`, `resource_id`, and `notes` from Log B were added to matching events from Log A.
- **Non-Matching Events**: Kept `Quality Check` (Log B) and `Item Delivered` (Log A) as standalone entries, noting their origin.
- **Primary Timestamp**: Used Log B’s timestamps for matching events to align with the more detailed system, but retained Log A’s timestamps where it provided a more precise or consistent time.

---

##  **Conclusion**

The merged log provides a **comprehensive, enriched view** of the order fulfillment process, combining the **primary timeline** of Log A with the **richer metadata** of Log B. Events were matched based on **semantic similarity** and **temporal proximity**, and non-matching events were preserved to ensure no data was lost. The final log is **chronologically ordered** and includes all relevant attributes for each event.
