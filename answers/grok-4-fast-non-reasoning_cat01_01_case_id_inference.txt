### Inferred Case Groupings

Based on the event attributes—particularly patient demographics (age and gender, which uniquely identify three distinct patients across all events), timestamps (sequential progression within each case), activity sequences (logical hospital workflow: registration  triage/consultation  tests/treatment  discharge), and departmental consistency—I have grouped the 18 events into **three distinct cases**. Each case represents a single patient's journey, with no overlap in patients. The sequences are interleaved temporally but follow standard process flows without contradictions.

#### Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER visit for leg injury, likely fracture)
- **Patient Profile**: Age 45, Gender M, Insurance: Private, Initial Department: ER.
- **Event Sequence** (logical flow: registration  triage  imaging  consultation  discharge):

#### Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER visit for infection)

#### Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Scheduled surgery)
- **Patient Profile**: Age 28, Gender M, Insurance: Private, Initial Department: Surgery.
- **Event Sequence** (logical flow: registration  consultation  preparation  surgery  recovery  discharge):
  3. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: insurance=private

  15. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z, activity: Recovery room, resource: Recovery Nurse, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: condition=stable  
  17. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z, activity: Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: followup=physiotherapy_sessions  

### Reasoning Summary
- **Patient Identification**: Age + gender uniquely distinguishes the three patients (no duplicates), serving as the primary grouping key. Insurance and additional_info (e.g., triage codes, diagnoses) further confirm separation.
- **Temporal Logic**: Events within each case are in increasing timestamp order, with gaps filled by other cases' events (interleaving). No event for one patient precedes another's registration or follows another's discharge in a way that suggests merging.
- **Activity Flow**: Each case follows a coherent hospital process (e.g., Case 1: ER diagnostics  discharge; Case 3: Surgery pipeline). Resources and departments align (e.g., Dr. Lee appears in both Case 1 and Case 3 but in contextually separate consultations).
- **Completeness**: All 18 events are assigned; no orphans or ambiguities. If case IDs were explicit, they might be labeled as "Patient_45M_ER", "Patient_62F_ER", "Patient_28M_Surgery" for clarity.
