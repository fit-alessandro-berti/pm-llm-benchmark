## 1. Queue Identification and Characterization

**Definition of Waiting Time**  
In the outpatient clinic context, the “waiting time” (or queue time) between two activities A and B for a given visit (case) is:  
WaitingTime(AB) = Timestamp<sub>Start</sub>(B)  Timestamp<sub>Complete</sub>(A)  
If the patient arrives directly into activity B without passing through A (e.g., urgent walk-in bypassing registration), we treat that wait as zero or flag it as a scheduling exception.  

**Key Metrics to Compute**  
For each pair of consecutive activities (e.g., RegistrationNurse Assessment, Nurse AssessmentDoctor Consultation, ConsultationDiagnostics, DiagnosticsCheck-out), calculate across all visits:  
- Average waiting time (mean)  
- Median waiting time  
- 90th percentile waiting time (P90)  
- Maximum waiting time  
- Standard deviation (to gauge variability)  
- Queue frequency (percentage of visits experiencing any wait > 0)  
- Count of “excessive waits” (visits exceeding a threshold, e.g., > 30 min)  

These metrics can be stratified by:  
- Patient Type (New vs. Follow-up)  
- Urgency (Normal vs. Urgent)  
- Time of day (morning vs. afternoon clinics)  
- Day of week  

**Identifying Critical Queues**  
To prioritize, rank queues by a combination of:  
1. Highest average waiting time (long delays affect many).  
2. Highest P90 or maximum (indicate extreme patient discomfort).  
3. High queue frequency (common bottlenecks).  
4. High impact on key patient segments (e.g., new patients or urgent cases).  

For example, if DiagnosticsCheck-out has a P90 of 25 min and occurs in 80 % of visits, whereas RegistrationNurse has a P90 of 15 min but only 40 % frequency, the former becomes a higher priority.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

Once bottleneck queues are pinpointed, deep-dive analyses help reveal underlying causes.

1. **Resource Bottlenecks**  
   - Use resource utilization metrics: calculate occupancy rates of staff (clerks, nurses, doctors) and rooms/equipment (labs, imaging) by comparing total busy time vs. available time.  
   - Identify over-utilized resources (> 85 % busy) causing backlogs; under-utilized (< 30 %) indicating imbalance.

2. **Activity Dependencies and Handover Delays**  
   - Perform handover analysis: measure the time between resource A completing an activity and resource B starting the next. Large handover times suggest poor coordination (e.g., clerk not notifying nurse).  
   - Map variants: discover common and exceptional paths (e.g., some patients are routed through Specialist Review before diagnostics, others after). Variant clustering reveals which flows incur the longest waits.

3. **Variability in Service Times**  
   - Analyze distribution of activity durations (CompleteStart) per activity. High variance in, e.g., ECG testing may cause unpredictable queues.  
   - Correlate long service times with specific staff or equipment to uncover training or maintenance issues.

4. **Appointment Scheduling Policies**  
   - Overlay scheduled appointment times vs. actual arrival and start times to detect “no-show” blocks or overbooking.  
   - Identify pulsed arrivals (bunched appointments at 9 am) causing spikes, versus flat arrivals.

5. **Patient Arrival Patterns**  
   - Timestamp analysis of arrival vs. registration start shows early/late arrivals.  
   - Chart arrival distributions: peaks indicate need for load-leveling.

6. **Patient Segment Differences**  
   - Cross-tabulate wait times by patient type/urgency. If new patients wait disproportionately longer at initial registration, policies may be needed to fast-track.

Process-mining techniques in use:  
- **Process Discovery** to visualize end-to-end flows and detect bypasses/exceptions.  
- **Conformance Checking** to compare actual sequences against the ideal model (e.g., every patient should do RegistrationNurseDoctorCheck-out).  
- **Bottleneck Analysis** to rank activities by average work-in-progress (WIP) and wait times.  
- **Variant Analysis** to group cases with similar paths and compare queue metrics across variants.

## 3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy A: Dynamic Resource Pooling for Registration and Check-out  
- **Target Queue:** RegistrationNurse Assessment and DiagnosticsCheck-out  
- **Root Cause:** Peak arrival loads overwhelm fixed clerks; check-out clerks remain idle at other times.  
- **Proposal:**  
  - Create a shared clerk pool that flexibly shifts between registration and check-out based on real-time queue lengths (using a simple threshold-based rule, e.g., if queue > 5 patients for > 10 min).  
  - Implement real-time queue monitoring dashboard integrated with the event log feed.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  - Reduce average registration wait from 8 min to  5 min (a 38 % reduction), and check-out wait from 12 min to  7 min (a 42 % reduction).  
  - Smooth staff utilization from peaks at 90 % to a target 75 – 80 %.  

### Strategy B: Staggered and Differential Appointment Scheduling  
- **Target Queue:** RegistrationNurse Assessment; NurseDoctor  
- **Root Cause:** Bunched arrivals at hour marks lead to simultaneous demand on front-end staff.  
- **Proposal:**  
  - Introduce “wave scheduling”: stagger appointment slots at 10-minute intervals rather than hourly, and reserve “float slots” every half-hour for urgent/walk-ins.  
  - Use historical data to model arrival spikes and adjust slot intervals dynamically by specialty.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  - Flatten arrival curve, reducing peak queue frequency by 50 %.  
  - Cut average wait to see nurse/doctor by 20 %.  

### Strategy C: Parallelization of Low-Risk Diagnostic Tests  
- **Target Queue:** ConsultationDiagnostics (e.g., Blood Test, X-Ray, ECG)  
- **Root Cause:** Serial processing forces a patient to wait for doctor before ordering tests, then return for tests.  
- **Proposal:**  
  - For well-defined protocols (e.g., follow-up hypertensive check), allow nurse to pre-order routine diagnostics immediately after assessment, sending patient directly to diagnostics before physician sees them.  
  - Pre-printing lab orders and bedside labeling speeds throughput.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  - Reduce handover delay by cutting the doctor order-to-test start wait from an average 18 min to  5 min (72 % reduction).  
  - Decrease total visit duration by 15 %.

## 4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints

- **Shifting the Bottleneck:**  
  - Dynamic pooling may relieve registration but shift wait to nurses if overall arrival volume exceeds clinic capacity.  
  - Mitigation: continuous monitoring of downstream queues; add flex nurses if nurse queue > 10 min for > 15 min.

- **Cost vs. Benefit:**  
  - Hiring additional “floater” staff incurs labor costs. Use data to model ROI: e.g., reducing average visit by 20 min frees ~3 extra slots per day per physician, generating revenue that offsets staffing costs.

- **Staff Workload and Satisfaction:**  
  - Dynamic shift assignments may cause unpredictability. Involve staff in planning; set upper limits on floating hours; rotate duties.

- **Quality of Care:**  
  - Parallelization of diagnostics must preserve clinical judgment. Limit to “low-risk” pathways where protocols are validated; audit quality metrics (e.g., diagnostic error rates).

- **Patient Experience:**  
  - Some strategies (e.g., pre-ordering tests) require clear communication to avoid patient confusion. Provide printed or digital itineraries showing next steps.

Balancing objectives requires a simulation or discrete-event model built from the mined process data. This “digital twin” can predict impacts before live rollout.

## 5. Measuring Success

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  
- Average and median waiting times for each critical queue.  
- 90th percentile waiting times.  
- Total throughput time (registration to check-out).  
- Resource utilization rates (by role and equipment).  
- Patient satisfaction scores (via post-visit surveys, specifically “waiting time” ratings).  
- No-show and cancellation rates.  
- Clinical quality indicators (e.g., re-visit rates within 7 days).

**Ongoing Monitoring Plan:**  
1. **Automated Dashboards:** Ingest the event log daily to update queue metrics in near real-time.  
2. **Threshold Alerts:** Configure alerts for any queue metric breaching pre-defined thresholds (e.g., average wait > 10 min).  
3. **Periodic Process Mining Audits:** Monthly reconformance analyses to detect process drift or new bottlenecks.  
4. **Continuous Improvement Cadence:** Quarterly review meetings with clinical leadership to adjust staffing, scheduling rules, or protocols based on KPI trends.  

By systematically mining the event log for both throughput times and queuing patterns—and by continuously validating improvements through the same data sources—the clinic can ensure optimizations deliver sustained reductions in waiting times without compromising care quality or inflating costs.
