**Summary of findings**

| Case | Verdict | Why it is a deviation (normative rule broken) |
|------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Compliant | Follows the “sufficientinventory” flow:Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. |
| 2    | Noncompliant | **Package items** occurs **before** **Authorize payment**. The description states that payment must be authorized *after* the inventory check **and before** any packaging. |
| 3    | Noncompliant | Two problems: <br>1. **Ship order** is executed **after** **Cancel order** – shipping must never follow a cancellation. <br>2. The branch for “insufficient inventory” should go directly from **Check inventory** to **Cancel order**; here a payment was authorized first, which is not allowed when the order is later cancelled. |
| 4    | Compliant | Correct “insufficientinventory” path:Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. |
| 5    | Noncompliant | **Package items** is missing; the process ships the order **without** having packaged it. The normative rules require packaging **after** payment authorization **and before** shipping. |

## Detailed explanation of each violation

### Case2 – “Package before payment”

```
Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
```

* **Rule broken:** “Authorize payment should only occur after ‘Check inventory’ **and before packaging**.”
* The log shows **Package items** preceding **Authorize payment**, which contradicts the required ordering.  
* Because the payment step is placed after packaging, the case violates the normative flow for a sufficientinventory scenario.

### Case3 – “Cancellation followed by shipping (and payment before cancellation)”

```
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order
```

* **Rule broken #1:** “Ship order should only occur after packaging and **never after a cancellation**.”
  * The log ships the order after it has already been cancelled, which is explicitly prohibited.
* **Rule broken #2 (implicit):** In the “insufficientinventory” branch the process must go **directly** from **Check inventory** to **Cancel order**; no further fulfillment activities (including payment) should happen after the check if the inventory is insufficient.
  * Here a payment was authorized before the cancellation, which is not allowed when the order is later cancelled because the cancellation indicates insufficient stock.

### Case5 – “Shipping without packaging”

```
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
```

* **Rule broken:** “Package items should only occur **after** authorization and **before** shipping.”
* The log skips the **Package items** step entirely, moving straight from payment authorization to shipping. This violates the requirement that items be prepared (packaged) before they can be shipped.

### Cases that **do not** violate the normative process

* **Case1** follows the full “sufficientinventory” path exactly as described.
* **Case4** follows the “insufficientinventory” (cancellation) path exactly as described.

## Bottom line

- **Violating cases:** **2,3,5**  
- **Compliant cases:** **1,4**  

The violations stem from activities occurring out of the prescribed order (package before payment, shipping after cancellation, missing packaging) and from a cancellation branch that does not follow the direct “Check  Cancel  Close” pattern required when inventory is insufficient.
