**Part 1: Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules)**

The strict sequence of activities outlined requires adherence to a linear process flow:

1. **Application Received:** The loan application is processed first.
2. **Credit Check:** A credit check must be performed after the application.
3. **Risk Assessment:** After the risk assessment, further risk evaluation is conducted if necessary.
4. **Loan Decision:** Based on the risk assessment, a decision to approve or reject the loan can be made.
5. **Inform Applicant:** The outcome of the process is communicated back to the applicant.
6. **If Approved:** Documentation must be finalized before case closure.
7. **If Rejected:** Case should close without finalizing documentation.

**Key Normative Constraints:**
- Sequence ensures a linear flow.
- Orders are strictly followed, avoiding skipping activities or contradictory actions like closing without documentation after rejection.

**What is Not Allowed:**
- Skipping steps in the required sequence
- Changing order of activities (e.g., Risk Assessment before Credit Check)
- Performing Finalize Documentation after Rejection

| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity              |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 1       | 2024-01-10 09:00    | Application Received  |
| 1       | 2024-01-10 09:30    | Credit Check          |
| 1       | 2024-01-10 10:00    | Risk Assessment       |
| 1       | 2024-01-10 11:00    | Loan Decision (Approved) |
| 1       | 2024-01-10 13:00    | Inform Applicant      |
| 1       | 2024-01-10 13:30    | Finalize Documentation|
| 1       | 2024-01-10 14:00    | Close Case            |

**Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**

The recommendations focus on best practices to improve adherence:

1. **Credit Check:** Completion within a short time window after application receipt, typically no more than 24 hours.
2. **Inform Applicant Promptly:** Immediate communication back to the applicant for any necessary updates or follow-ups.

**Key Normative Constraints:**
- Recommended timing constraints and immediate notifications can be prioritized over all other rules in this context.

**Desiderata Violations Identified**

1. A case is violating a normative rule by failing to complete the Credit Check within 24 hours.
2. Another desideratum violation occurs when Finalize Documentation, which should not occur after rejection, happens more than 48 hours later.

**Recommended Interpretations and Justifications:**
- The credit check issue is related to adherence to standard procedures for loan approval processes; it's crucial that all applications are processed in the same order as required.
- While there is a need for immediate follow-up communication post-case closure, this case does not violate any normative rules.
