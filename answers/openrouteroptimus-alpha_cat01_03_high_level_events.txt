Certainly! Let's approach this systematically:

## **1. Analysis of Low-Level Event Sequences**

For each **CaseID**, the following sequence of low-level events consistently appears (ordering may be approximate):

1. **Retrieve raw metal sheet**  
2. **Scan barcode**  
3. **Place metal sheet on table**  
4. **Align metal sheet**  
5. **Preheat metal sheet**  
6. **Pick up welding tool**  
7. **Weld corner A**  
8. **Weld corner B**  
9. **Measure weld integrity**  
10. **Apply protective coating**  
11. **Dry coating**  
12. **Visual check**  

These sequences are common to both presented cases. We will now group these into meaningful high-level steps.

## **2. Identified High-Level Activities**

### **A. Material Preparation**

#### **Included Low-Level Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

#### **Rationale:**
All events in this group are directly related to making the raw material ready for further processing. Retrieval, identification, positioning, and preheating are logically the initial setup steps in most manufacturing workflows. They are temporally close, mostly performed by Operator A and/or robots focused on setup and preparation.

#### **Proposed Name:**  
**Material Preparation**

---

### **B. Welding/Joining Assembly**

#### **Included Low-Level Events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

#### **Rationale:**
These steps focus on the main assembly operation that joins or works on the material. They occur immediately after preparation and relate to the critical physical transformation of the product, performed by the same operator/resource. They are distinct from preparation and quality steps.

#### **Proposed Name:**  
**Assembly – Welding/Joining**

---

### **C. In-Process Quality Verification**

#### **Included Low-Level Event:**
- Measure weld integrity

#### **Rationale:**
This is a logical break in the process: once the welds are made, an automated measurement is performed by a quality sensor to assess whether the weld meets standards before allowing further processing. This is distinct from final inspection.

#### **Proposed Name:**  
**In-Process Quality Check**

---

### **D. Surface Protection**

#### **Included Low-Level Events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

#### **Rationale:**
These two events are concerned with adding and setting a protective layer, typically a distinct manufacturing stage. They follow quality verification and prepare the product for final use or inspection.

#### **Proposed Name:**  
**Surface Finishing**

---

### **E. Final Inspection**

#### **Included Low-Level Event:**
- Visual check

#### **Rationale:**
A human operator performs a final assessment, signifying the end of the production process for that case. It's temporally last and distinct from automated quality checks.

#### **Proposed Name:**  
**Final Inspection**

## **3. Structured Representation of High-Level Activities**

**For each CaseID, the mapping is as follows:**

| **High-Level Step**      | **Low-Level Events Included** (in sequence)                | **Description**                       |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Material Preparation    | Retrieve raw metal sheet; Scan barcode; Place metal sheet on table; Align metal sheet; Preheat metal sheet | Setting up raw materials for processing |
| Assembly – Welding/Joining | Pick up welding tool; Weld corner A; Weld corner B           | Performing main assembly/joining       |
| In-Process Quality Check | Measure weld integrity                                     | Automated verification post-assembly   |
| Surface Finishing       | Apply protective coating; Dry coating                       | Applying and curing surface treatment  |
| Final Inspection        | Visual check                                               | Human-based acceptance review          |

## **Conclusion**

**Grouping Rationale:**  
We aggregated low-level events into high-level activities based on:
- **Process role** (preparation, assembly, inspection, finishing, final check)
- **Temporal sequence** (coherent stages)
- **Resource specialization** (operators, machines, quality sensors)
- **Discrete process transitions** (where the nature of work changes)

**Result:**  
You now have a clear, domain-relevant, and structured mapping of granular events to intuitive process steps, making higher-level process analysis feasible for the entire manufacturing workflow.
