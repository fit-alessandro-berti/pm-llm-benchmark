Here's the DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the specified requirements:

```sql
WITH filtered_cases AS (
    -- Identify cases with the exact sequence and timing condition
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM (
        -- Get the sequence positions for each case
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num,
            LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity
        FROM event_log
    ) AS numbered_events
    WHERE
        -- Check for the exact sequence (Approve Purchase Requisition -> Create Order -> Confirm Order)
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND
        prev_activity = 'Create Order' AND
        LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Confirm Order' AND
        -- Calculate time between Create Order and Confirm Order
        (SELECT MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp)
         FROM event_log
         WHERE case_id = numbered_events.case_id
         AND activity IN ('Create Order', 'Confirm Order'))
        > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

-- Return all events except those from filtered cases
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);
```

Alternative version that might be more efficient (especially for large datasets):

```sql
WITH sequence_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
        FROM event_log
    ) ranked
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND rn = 1
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM event_log e2
        WHERE e2.case_id = ranked.case_id
        AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND e2.timestamp > ranked.timestamp
        AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM event_log e3
            WHERE e3.case_id = e2.case_id
            AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
            AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
            AND (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
        )
    )
)

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases);
```

Both queries will return all events from cases that don't have the exact sequence of three activities in direct succession with more than 5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.
