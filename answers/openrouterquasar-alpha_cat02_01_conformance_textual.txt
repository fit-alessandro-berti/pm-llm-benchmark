**Overview**

According to the normative description, a compliant process should:

- **Start** with **Receive order** and end with **Close order**.
- **Always check inventory immediately after receiving an order**.
- **Branch based on inventory result**: 
  - **Sufficient inventory:**
    - Sequence = Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order
  - **Insufficient inventory:**
    - Sequence = Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order
- **Constraints:**
  - **Authorize payment only after** inventory **check, never before**.
  - **Authorize payment precedes packaging and shipping**.
  - **Packaging only after payment authorization, and before shipping**.
  - **No fulfillment activities (Pack, Ship) after cancellation**.
  - **Close order is always the final activity**.

### Step 1: Identify deviating cases

**Case 1:**
```
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order
```
*Follows the sufficient inventory flow perfectly.*

** Conforms.**

---

**Case 2:**
```
Receive  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
```
**Violations:**
- **Packaging occurs *before* payment authorization**, which breaches:

> "...'Package items' should only occur after authorization ..., since items must be prepared after authorization and before shipping..."

- Correct sequence requires **authorize payment first, then package**.

---

**Case 3:**
```
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order
```
**Violations:**
- **Cancellation yet proceeding with shipping**:

> "...it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)... after cancellation..."

- Shipping after a cancellation is explicitly forbidden.
  
- Additionally, **payment was authorized before order got canceled**; this is possible if initial expectation was fulfillment, so it's a gray area but NOT explicitly forbidden. However, canceling after authorization without refund isn't described, but the main violation is **shipping after cancelling**.

---

**Case 4:**
```
Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order
```
Follows insufficient inventory branch strictly.

** Conforms.**

---

**Case 5:**
```
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
```
**Violations:**
- **Missing "Package items" before shipping**:

> "...once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment — this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged ... 'Ship order'."

Packaging step is **required** before shipping, so its absence is a deviation.

| Case | Deviations?                       | Reasoning                                                                                               |
|-------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1** | **No**                           | Fully aligns with sufficient inventory scenario                                                        |
| **2** | **Yes**                          | Packaged **before** authorizing payment                                                                |
| **3** | **Yes**                          | **Shipped order after cancelling** (forbidden)                                                         |
| **4** | **No**                           | Fully aligns with insufficient inventory scenario                                                      |
| **5** | **Yes**                          | **Skipped "Package items" step** before shipping                                                       |

## **Final Answers**

### Cases that violate normative process:

- **Case 2**
- **Case 3**
- **Case 5**

### **Explanations:**

- **Case 2:** Packaging was performed **before** payment authorization, violating sequence constraints.
- **Case 3:** The order was **shipped after it was canceled**, which is explicitly prohibited.
- **Case 5:** **Shipping occurred without packaging items first**—skipping a mandatory preparatory step.

**Cases 1 and 4 conform** to the described normative process expectations.
