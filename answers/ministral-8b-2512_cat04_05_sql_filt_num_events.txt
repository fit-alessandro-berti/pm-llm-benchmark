Here's a well-structured DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task:

```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) <= 6
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT
        e.*
    FROM
        event_log e
    JOIN
        case_counts cc ON e.case_id = cc.case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM
    filtered_cases
ORDER BY
    case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation:

1. **First CTE (`case_counts`)**:
   - Groups events by `case_id` and counts them
   - Filters to only include cases with 6 or fewer events using `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`

2. **Second CTE (`filtered_cases`)**:
   - Joins the original event log with the filtered case counts
   - This ensures we only get events from cases that passed the count filter

3. **Final SELECT**:
   - Returns all columns from the filtered events
   - Orders results by `case_id` and `timestamp` for better readability

### Alternative (single-query) version:

```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

Both queries will return all events from cases with 6 or fewer events, while excluding any events from cases with more than 6 events.
