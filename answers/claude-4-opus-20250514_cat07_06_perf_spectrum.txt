This visualization appears to be a Sankey diagram or flow chart showing the progression of financial penalties or actions over time. The diagram has three levels or stages arranged vertically:

1. **Top level: "Send Fine"** - This appears to be the initial action, represented by a large gray block with many vertical lines flowing downward.

2. **Middle level: "Insert Fine Notification"** - This is an intermediate step where the flows from the top level converge.

3. **Bottom level: "Send for Credit Collection"** - This appears to be the final action, where some portion of the cases progress to credit collection.

The visualization uses a gray-to-red color gradient, with flows that proceed to credit collection highlighted in red/pink tones, while those that don't progress appear in gray. The width of the flows seems to represent the volume or number of cases at each stage.

The timeline at the bottom spans from January 25, 2000 to April 24, 2013, indicating this data covers over 13 years of financial penalty processing.

The diagram effectively shows how fines flow through the system, with only a subset eventually reaching the credit collection stage, visualized by the narrowing of the red-colored flows compared to the initial gray block.
