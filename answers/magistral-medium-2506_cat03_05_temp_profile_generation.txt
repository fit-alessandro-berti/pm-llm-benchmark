Here’s a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process. The values for average time and standard deviation are estimated based on typical durations and variability in such processes (expressed in seconds for consistency with the example):

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected pairs (consecutive activities)
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600),         # 1 day ± 1 hour (supplier selection to order placement)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),       # 7 days ± 1 day (order placement to receipt)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),        # 1 day ± 6 hours (receipt to inspection)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 10800),        # 12 hours ± 3 hours (inspection to assembly)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 7200),         # 6 hours ± 2 hours (assembly to testing)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 1800),          # 1 hour ± 30 minutes (testing to packaging)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 3600),          # 2 hours ± 1 hour (packaging to storage)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 43200),       # 2 days ± 12 hours (storage to distribution)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800),     # 30 days ± 7 days (distribution to after-sales)

    # Non-consecutive pairs (skipping intermediate steps)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (691200, 172800),      # 8 days ± 2 days (supplier selection to receipt)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (777600, 172800),      # 9 days ± 2 days (supplier selection to inspection)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (691200, 86400),       # 8 days ± 1 day (order placement to inspection)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (734400, 86400),       # 8.5 days ± 1 day (order placement to assembly)
    ('RC', 'PT'): (172800, 36000),       # 2 days ± 10 hours (receipt to testing)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (64800, 18000),        # 18 hours ± 5 hours (inspection to testing)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (28800, 7200),         # 8 hours ± 2 hours (assembly to packaging)
    ('PT', 'WS'): (10800, 3600),         # 3 hours ± 1 hour (testing to storage)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (176400, 43200),       # 2 days ± 12 hours (packaging to distribution)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (967200, 259200),      # ~11 days ± 3 days (supplier selection to distribution)
    ('OP', 'DT'): (882000, 216000),      # ~10 days ± 2.5 days (order placement to distribution)
    ('RC', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),       # 3 days ± 1 day (receipt to distribution)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (194400, 43200),       # 2.25 days ± 12 hours (inspection to distribution)
    ('CA', 'DT'): (172800, 36000),       # 2 days ± 10 hours (assembly to distribution)
    ('SS', 'AS'): (3456000, 864000),     # ~40 days ± 10 days (supplier selection to after-sales)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800),     # 30 days ± 7 days (distribution to after-sales, same as direct)
    ('WS', 'AS'): (2678400, 604800),     # ~31 days ± 7 days (storage to after-sales)
}
```

### Key Notes:
1. **Consecutive Activities**: Pairs like `('OP', 'RC')` (order to receipt) have relatively tight time bounds (e.g., 7 days ± 1 day for shipping delays).
2. **Non-Consecutive Activities**: Pairs like `('SS', 'DT')` (supplier selection to distribution) span multiple steps, so their variability is larger (e.g., 11 days ± 3 days).
3. **Long-Term Dependencies**: After-sales support (`AS`) is far removed from early activities like `SS`, with high variability (e.g., 40 days ± 10 days).
4. **Realism**: The standard deviation scales with the average time (e.g., 30% of average for longer-duration pairs).

This profile captures the complexity of the supply chain, including variability due to external factors (e.g., shipping delays, testing bottlenecks). Adjustments can be made based on domain-specific insights.
