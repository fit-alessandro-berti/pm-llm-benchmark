```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    LIST_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp ASC) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
top_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
  LIMIT 10
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
  SELECT cv.case_id
  FROM case_variants cv
  WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT * FROM top_variants)
)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp ASC;
```

## Explanation
- **case_variants CTE**: Computes the ordered sequence of activities (`variant`) for each `case_id` using `LIST_AGG` ordered by `timestamp`. This captures the process variant as a list.
- **top_variants CTE**: Groups cases by their variant, counts the frequency of each variant, and selects the top 10 most frequent variants using `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10`.
- **Final SELECT**: Filters the original `event_log` to include only events from cases whose variant matches one of the top 10 variants. Results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for readability.
- **Notes**: 
  - DuckDB's `LIST` type enables direct equality comparison for variants.
  - `LIMIT 10` is used for the top K (K=10); adjust as needed for specific benchmarks.
  - Handles repeated activities correctly (no `DISTINCT`).
  - Assumes timestamps uniquely order events within a case; ties are handled by DuckDB's stable sort.
