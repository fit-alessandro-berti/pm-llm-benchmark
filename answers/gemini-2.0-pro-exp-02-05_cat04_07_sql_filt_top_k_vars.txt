**Explanation:**

1.  **`CaseActivitySequences` CTE:**
    *   Groups the `event_log` table by `case_id`.
    *   Within each group (case), it uses `string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp ASC)` to concatenate the `activity` names into a single string, separated by ` -> `. Crucially, the `ORDER BY timestamp ASC` clause *inside* the aggregation function ensures the activities are listed in the correct chronological order for that case. This string represents the process variant for the case.
    *   An alternative using `list_agg` is commented out; it would produce an actual list/array data type instead of a string. `string_agg` is often easier for direct comparison and viewing.

2.  **`TopKVariants` CTE:**
    *   Takes the output from `CaseActivitySequences`.
    *   Groups by the generated `activity_sequence` (the variant).
    *   Counts the number of `case_id`s associated with each unique `activity_sequence`, aliasing this count as `frequency`.
    *   Orders the results by `frequency` in descending order (`DESC`) to get the most frequent variants first.
    *   Uses `LIMIT {{ K }}` to select only the top K most frequent variants. Remember to replace `{{ K }}` with your desired number.

3.  **`CasesInTopK` CTE:**
    *   Joins `CaseActivitySequences` (which links `case_id` to its `activity_sequence`) with `TopKVariants` (which contains only the sequences of the top K variants).
    *   The `INNER JOIN` ensures that only rows where the `activity_sequence` exists in both CTEs are kept.
    *   `SELECT DISTINCT cas.case_id` extracts the unique IDs of all cases that follow one of the top K variants.

4.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   Selects all columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) from the original `event_log` table (aliased as `el`).
    *   `INNER JOIN CasesInTopK citk ON el.case_id = citk.case_id` filters the `event_log`, keeping only those rows (events) where the `case_id` matches one of the IDs identified in the `CasesInTopK` CTE.
    *   The optional `ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp` clause sorts the final output, making it easier to follow individual cases.

This query efficiently identifies process variants, ranks them by frequency, filters cases based on the top K variants, and retrieves the corresponding raw events using standard SQL features well-supported by DuckDB.
