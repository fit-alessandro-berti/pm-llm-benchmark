**Renaming Rationale:**

1. **Repeated \:**
   - Renamed to distinguish between initial and follow-up verifications
   - Added context about the verification stage (Initial, Final, Confirmation)
   - Reflects the evolving nature of document verification in the process

2. **Multiple \- Differentiated based on purpose (Follow-up, Clarification, Location Follow-up)
   - Highlights the distinct roles of customer interaction at different process stages

3. **\iate Request\ Renamed to \ify the nature of the initial interaction
   - Distinguishes between different request initiation channels (web, branch)

4. **\- Renamed to \ emphasize it as the concluding step
   - Consistent across cases to show the final stage of the process

The renamed activities now provide a clearer narrative of the process flow, showing how the same activity names can represent different process stages and interactions depending on their context.
