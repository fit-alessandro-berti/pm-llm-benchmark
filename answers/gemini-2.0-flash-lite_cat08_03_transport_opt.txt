Here's a comprehensive approach to analyze Speedy Parcels' operations and recommend improvements using process mining:

**1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

*   **Data Preprocessing and Integration:**

    *   **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers in each data source. This includes validating GPS data (removing implausible jumps in location), driver scan timestamps (ensuring logical sequences), and dispatch data (correcting errors in planned routes).
    *   **Data Harmonization:** Standardize date/time formats, location representations (using a consistent coordinate system), and event descriptions across all sources. Establish common event types (e.g., "Depot Departure," "Arrive Customer," "Delivery Success," "Vehicle Breakdown") to facilitate cross-source analysis.
    *   **Event Log Creation:** The most critical step.  Create a unified event log, where each row represents an individual event tied to a *Case ID* (e.g., Vehicle-Day as defined in the example) and a *Trace*.  Each trace represents a single delivery process for a vehicle on a given day.  Columns will include timestamp, event type, case ID, vehicle ID, driver ID, package ID (if relevant), location data (latitude/longitude, or geocoded address), speed, and any relevant notes or attributes.  Link data using common keys:
        *   Vehicle ID and Date: Connects all sources for each vehicle's daily operations.
        *   Package ID (from scanner data to dispatch and potentially GPS): Links individual deliveries to route planning information.
    *   **Challenges:**
        *   Data quality: Requires robust validation rules and outlier handling to ensure the integrity of the log.
        *   Data volume: Dealing with large datasets requires optimized storage and processing techniques.
        *   Data integration complexity: Ensuring the correct joining of data from multiple, potentially heterogeneous, sources.
        *   Time Synchronization: Ensuring consistent timestamps between different data sources is critical. Consider time zone differences.

*   **Process Discovery:**

    *   **Algorithm Selection:** Choose process discovery algorithms suited for transportation and logistics, such as the Heuristic Miner or Inductive Miner (particularly suited for complex, noisy processes).  These algorithms automatically generate a process model from the event log.
    *   **Visualization:** The resulting model will be a graphical representation of the delivery process, including activities (e.g., "Depart Depot," "Arrive Customer," "Delivery Success"), sequence, concurrency (parallel activities), and loops (e.g., repeated delivery attempts).
    *   **Process Model Refinement:** The initial process model might be complex.  Refine it by filtering less relevant events, aggregating activities (e.g., combine "Arrive Customer" and "Depart Customer" into a "Customer Stop" activity), or focusing on specific aspects of the process (e.g., only analyzing delivery attempts that were successful).
    *   **Example Process View:** The discovered process might reveal:
        *   The average duration of each activity (e.g., customer stops, travel time).
        *   The frequency and duration of delays at specific locations.
        *   Patterns of failed deliveries.
        *   The frequency of unplanned stops.
        *   Common sequences like "Depart Depot" -> "Travel to Stop 1" -> "Arrive Customer" -> "Delivery Success" -> "Depart Customer" -> "Travel to Stop 2"... -> "Return to Depot".
        *   The overall distribution of travel times and service times (customer interaction time).

*   **Conformance Checking:**

    *   **Baseline:** Start with the dispatch system’s planned routes as the "reference model."
    *   **Deviation Analysis:** Use conformance checking techniques to compare the actual delivery process (discovered process model) with the planned routes.  Look for:
        *   **Sequence Deviations:** Are vehicles following the planned stop sequences?
        *   **Unplanned Activities:** Are there frequent unplanned stops (e.g., driver breaks, detours)?
        *   **Timing Differences:** Analyze the time spent on each activity and the overall route duration. Are delivery times significantly different from planned?
        *   **Unplanned Loops:** Are there loops created due to repeated delivery attempts or vehicle breakdowns.
    *   **Metrics:** Calculate conformance metrics, such as:
        *   **Deviation Rate:** The percentage of activities deviating from the planned routes.
        *   **Time Deviation:** The difference between planned and actual activity/route durations.
        *   **Trace Replay:** The visualization of how the actual process followed the planned process, highlighting activities where differences occurred.
    *   **Insights:** Conformance checking identifies where planning and execution diverge. For instance, it might reveal that vehicles consistently deviate from planned routes due to traffic congestion or drivers deviating from their assigned routes.

**2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

    *   **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR):** Percentage of deliveries completed within the customer's requested or agreed-upon delivery window. Calculated by comparing the 'Arrive Customer' timestamp with the customer's time window.
    *   **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Total time spent at customer locations (from "Arrive Customer" to "Depart Customer"), analyzed by route, driver, time of day.
    *   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Provides insights into the balance between driving and customer interaction. Calculated by analyzing the total travel time between stops and the total service time (from arrival to departure).
    *   **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Fuel consumption data (from vehicle sensors or fuel purchase logs) is divided by the total distance travelled and the number of packages delivered.
    *   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Percentage of time a vehicle is actively used (ignition on, moving) during a shift. Calculate the ratio of "active" time to "shift" time.
    *   **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:** Analyze the GPS data. Calculate the time spent at low speeds (e.g., below 10 km/h) indicating traffic and determine their impact on delivery times.
    *   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:**  Number of delivery attempts failed, divided by the total number of delivery attempts, analyzed by route, time of day, and location.

*   **Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**

    *   **Process Mapping:** Visualize the process to identify activity hotspots (e.g., those taking the longest time).
    *   **Bottleneck Analysis:** Identify activities where tasks accumulate ("bottlenecks"). This can involve analyzing event logs for queues.
        *   Identify the step in the process that has the highest average processing time.
        *   Identify the step in the process with the most occurrences.
        *   Identify the step in the process with the greatest number of waiting items.
    *   **Time Analysis:** Examine the time spent on each activity, including travel time, service time, and waiting time.
    *   **Frequency Analysis:** Examine how frequently events occur.
    *   **Variant Analysis:** Analyze the performance of different process variants (e.g., different routes, drivers, times of day) to understand performance variations.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Correlate identified bottlenecks with specific events.
    *   **Quantifying Impact:** Use performance metrics to measure the impact of bottlenecks. For example, if a bottleneck is identified at "Customer Stop," quantify the average time increase, the impact on OTDR, and potential cost implications (e.g., overtime, fuel).
    *   **Identifying Potential Bottlenecks:** Based on the example event data:
        *   **Customer Stop:** Might be a bottleneck due to long service times.
        *   **High traffic routes:** May reveal that time lost in traffic is the bottleneck.
        *   **Unplanned stops:** Can reveal that vehicles are experiencing frequent breakdowns or other issues, or the locations of the unplanned stops may be another indicator.

**3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
    *   **Analysis:** Conformance checking can identify deviations from planned routes, indicating route planning deficiencies. Variant analysis can compare the performance of planned routes with routes that were adjusted in real-time due to unforeseen events.
    *   **Root Cause:** Inefficient or static routing.
    *   **Validation:** Correlation analysis can compare the routes with high traffic density to those with low traffic density and examine the impact of traffic on the delivery times and overall performance.
*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
    *   **Analysis:** Compare planned travel times (from dispatch) with actual travel times (from GPS data).
    *   **Root Cause:** Static routing algorithms failing to account for traffic, road closures, and other dynamic factors.
    *   **Validation:**  Correlate actual travel times with traffic data, time of day, and day of the week to identify patterns and improve estimations.
*   **Impact of Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
    *   **Analysis:** Correlate traffic data (from GPS data or external sources) with delivery delays. Identify "hotspots" and the time-of-day impact.
    *   **Root Cause:** Vehicles getting stuck in traffic.
    *   **Validation:** Use variant analysis to compare performance on routes that intersect with high-traffic areas during peak hours against routes planned to avoid them.
*   **High Variability in Service Time at Customer Locations:**
    *   **Analysis:** Analyze the time spent on each customer stop. Identify outliers and patterns (e.g., customers with consistently long service times).
    *   **Root Cause:** Variability in customer service needs or inefficiencies during delivery (e.g., difficulty finding the delivery location, waiting for customer).
    *   **Validation:** Examine the impact of customer service time on the average time per delivery stop, the OTDR, and overall performance.
*   **Frequency and Impact of Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance:**
    *   **Analysis:** Analyze the frequency and duration of unplanned stops from the vehicle maintenance logs and correlate these with the GPS data and scan data.
    *   **Root Cause:** Poor maintenance, equipment failure.
    *   **Validation:** Conduct a variant analysis to compare the performance of routes driven by vehicles with poor maintenance, vs. vehicles that have undergone regular maintenance.
*   **Driver Behavior/Skill Differences:**
    *   **Analysis:**  Compare the performance of drivers based on KPIs.
    *   **Root Cause:** Driver skill (efficiency) differences, driver training and compliance.
    *   **Validation:** Segment the event log based on driver ID.  Use variant analysis to compare performance across different drivers.
*   **Issues Related to Failed Delivery Attempts:**
    *   **Analysis:** Analyze the frequency and reasons for failed deliveries (from scanner data). Determine locations and times of day with higher failure rates.
    *   **Root Cause:** Customer unavailability, incorrect address, or issues with the delivery process.
    *   **Validation:** Segment the event log by delivery failure rate and then compare the routes against planned routes to understand any patterns.
