Below is an analysis of the event log along with the identification of cases with prolonged resolution times, potential root causes, and recommendations to address performance bottlenecks.


1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

• Case 102:  
  – Start: 20240301 08:05 ("Receive Ticket")  
  – End: 20240302 09:15 ("Close Ticket")  
  – Total Duration: Over 25 hours from receipt to closure.

• Case 104:  
  – Start: 20240301 08:20 ("Receive Ticket")  
  – End: 20240302 08:30 ("Close Ticket")  
  – Total Duration: Approximately 24 hours.

• Case 105:  
  – Start: 20240301 08:25 ("Receive Ticket")  
  – End: 20240303 09:30 ("Close Ticket")  
  – Total Duration: Almost 49 hours.

In contrast, Cases 101 and 103 had the shortest cycle times (just a few hours from receive to close).


2. Potential Root Causes of the Performance Issues

• Escalations:  
  – Cases 102 and 105 required escalation to Level2 Agents. Escalations introduce additional review layers and waiting periods before investigation or resolution occurs.  
  – For example, in Case 102, the escalation at 11:30 delayed the investigation (which did not begin until 14:00) and extended the resolution beyond the day of receipt.

• Long Waiting Times Between Key Activities:  
  – In Case 102, there was a significant delay between ticket assignment (09:00) and the escalation at 11:30.  
  – Similarly, in Case 104, there is a noticeable gap between the assignment (09:30) and when investigation begins (13:00).  
  – In Case 105, after the initial investigation at 09:10, the escalation occurs at 10:00, and then the next investigation step is delayed until 20240302 14:00. These gaps indicate waiting times where tickets might be idle rather than being actively worked on.

• Delay Before Investigative Actions:  
  – Delays before the investigation phase (as seen in Cases 102, 104, and 105) prolong the overall cycle time. The time taken to triage, reassign, or escalate contributes to the issue resolution lag.


3. How These Factors Lead to Increased Cycle Times and Recommendations

• Impact of Escalations:  
  – Escalations naturally impose extra handoffs and queue delays. When a ticket is escalated, it can lead to waiting for the availability of specialized agents, thereby extending the time before investigative and resolution steps occur.  
  – Recommendation: Improve the triage process to better assess tickets that might require specialized knowledge. If possible, create a more direct routing mechanism for tickets that need escalation, reducing the hand-off delays.

• Waiting Time Optimizations:  
  – Extended waiting times between activities (especially between assignment, escalation, and investigation) lead to inefficient use of support resources.  
  – Recommendation: Implement Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for transition times between key activities. For example, set maximum allowable times between ticket receipt, assignment, and initiation of investigation. Automated reminders or escalations could be triggered if these thresholds are exceeded.

• Process Streamlining for Investigative Actions:  
  – Delayed investigations slow resolution, as considerable idle time in the process contributes to a prolonged cycle.  
  – Recommendation: Review and modify the workflow to ensure a faster transition from triage to investigation. This might involve cross-training agents or ensuring that escalations come with immediate hand-offs rather than delays. Additionally, implementing process automation to notify and reassign tickets rapidly could help decrease waiting durations.


Conclusion

The analysis of the event log shows that Cases 102, 104, and 105 take significantly longer to close compared to Cases 101 and 103. The presence of escalations, long waiting times between steps, and delays before investigators begin work are the key contributing factors. Addressing these issues through improved triage accuracy, defined SLAs, process automation, and rapid handoffs when escalations are required can help reduce the overall cycle times and improve customer satisfaction in the support ticket resolution process.
