## Process Mining for Advanced Scheduling in Precision Parts Inc.

As a Senior Operations Analyst specializing in manufacturing process optimization, I will leverage the detailed MES event logs from Precision Parts Inc. to transform their scheduling capabilities. My approach will systematically move from historical analysis to the design and continuous improvement of sophisticated, data-driven scheduling strategies.

### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

Process mining offers a powerful lens to reconstruct and analyze the *actual* flow of jobs and task execution sequences.

**Reconstruction of Job Flow and Execution Sequence:**
I would begin by using the `Case ID (Job ID)` as the case identifier, `Timestamp` as the timestamp, and `Activity/Task` as the activity name. This allows us to trace the complete lifecycle of each job, from `Job Released` to its final `Task End` (or completion). The `Resource (Machine ID)` and `Operator ID` attributes are crucial for understanding resource allocation.

**Specific Process Mining Techniques and Metrics:**

*   **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
    *   **Technique:** Process discovery (e.g., Alpha Miner, Heuristic Miner, Inductive Miner) to visualize actual process models, followed by performance analysis.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Lead Time:** `Timestamp` of `Task End` (last activity for a case) - `Timestamp` of `Job Released`. This will be aggregated per job.
        *   **Makespan:** The time from the earliest `Job Released` timestamp to the latest `Task End` timestamp across all jobs in a defined period (e.g., daily, weekly). This measures overall shop throughput.
        *   **Flow Time Distribution:** Plotting histograms and calculating descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles) for job lead times to understand variability and typical completion durations.
        *   **Bottleneck Analysis within Flow:** By analyzing activity durations and waiting times across the process model, I can identify specific tasks or resources that contribute disproportionately to the overall flow time.

*   **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times) at Each Work Center/Machine:**
    *   **Technique:** Performance analysis on discovered process models, filtering by resource.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   `Queue Entry` (e.g., `Queue Entry (Cutting)`) to `Setup Start` (or `Task Start` if no setup). This measures the time a job spends waiting for a resource to become available.
        *   Calculate mean, median, standard deviation of queue times for each `Resource (Machine ID)`. High variability or consistently long queue times indicate bottlenecks or inefficient resource allocation.
        *   **Heatmaps:** Visualize queue times on the process map to quickly identify congested points.

*   **Resource (Machine and Operator) Utilization:**
    *   **Technique:** Resource analysis (e.g., Social Network Miner for operator interaction, but primarily focusing on resource utilization metrics).
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Productive Time:** Sum of `Actual Task Duration` per resource.
        *   **Setup Time:** Sum of actual setup durations per resource.
        *   **Idle Time:** Total observed time for a resource minus its productive time and setup time. This is complex and might require inferring idle periods from the absence of events between tasks.
        *   **Utilization Rate:** (Productive Time + Setup Time) / Total Available Time.
        *   **Breakdown Impact:** Analyze `Breakdown Start` and `Breakdown End` events to quantify downtime for specific machines and subtract this from available time to calculate more accurate utilization or highlight loss.
        *   **Operator Workload:** Analyze `Task Start` and `Task End` events by `Operator ID` to understand individual operator utilization and identify potential overload or underutilization.

*   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
    *   **Technique:** Custom event log analysis and attribute filtering.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   Filter events for `Event Type = Task` and `Activity/Task = Setup End`.
        *   Extract `Resource (Machine ID)`, `Actual Task Duration` for setup, and the `Notes` field for `Previous job`.
        *   **Cross-Reference:** For each `Setup End` event, identify the `Case ID` of the job that just completed on that `Resource (Machine ID)` immediately prior to the current job's setup start. This links the "previous job" type/properties to the "current job" properties.
        *   **Categorization:** Group setups by (Previous Job Type, Current Job Type) or relevant attributes (e.g., material, geometry, machine configuration change) that influence setup time.
        *   **Statistical Analysis:** Calculate average, min, max, and standard deviation of setup times for each specific transition (e.g., from Job Type A to Job Type B on CUT-01). This quantifies the actual sequence dependency.

*   **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
    *   **Technique:** Conformance checking and custom attribute analysis.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   For each `Case ID`, extract the `Timestamp` of the final `Task End` event and its `Order Due Date`.
        *   **Tardiness:** `MAX(0, Final Task End Timestamp - Order Due Date)`.
        *   **Earliness:** `MAX(0, Order Due Date - Final Task End Timestamp)`.
        *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of jobs with Tardiness = 0.
        *   **Tardiness Distribution:** Histograms of tardiness values to understand typical delays and identify severe cases.
        *   **Due Date Hit Rate per Resource/Activity:** Analyze if certain activities or resources consistently precede late jobs.

*   **Impact of Disruptions (Breakdowns, Priority Changes):**
    *   **Technique:** Anomaly detection, process discovery variants, and performance analysis.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Breakdown Frequency and Duration:** Count `Breakdown Start` events and measure `Breakdown End` - `Breakdown Start` per resource.
        *   **Impact on Downstream Queue:** Analyze queue times for resources downstream from a breakdown to quantify ripple effects.
        *   **Priority Change Analysis:** Track `Order Priority` changes for jobs. Compare lead times, queue times, and tardiness for jobs whose priority changed vs. those that maintained their initial priority. Did the `High (Urgent)` jobs actually get processed faster? Was this at the expense of other jobs?
        *   **Variant Analysis:** Discover process variants (actual paths jobs take). Compare variants of "jobs affected by breakdown" or "jobs affected by priority change" against "normal" variants to see deviations in routing, queue times, and overall lead times.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

By applying the above analyses, I expect to uncover several key pathologies:

*   **Identification of Bottleneck Resources:**
    *   **Evidence:** Consistently high queue times (long waiting durations) for jobs at specific machines (e.g., CUT-01, MILL-03, GRIND-02). High utilization rates for these machines nearing 100%, even with significant queue buildup. The "flow time contribution" analysis will show that these resources account for a disproportionately large share of total lead time.
    *   **Process Mining:** Performance analysis showing long "arcs" representing waiting times before bottleneck activities. Resource utilization dashboards highlighting consistently busy machines.

*   **Poor Task Prioritization:**
    *   **Evidence:** Jobs with `Order Priority = High (Urgent)` or `Order Due Date` nearing completion are observed to be waiting in queues behind `Medium` or `Low` priority jobs, or jobs with distant due dates. High tardiness for high-priority jobs.
    *   **Process Mining:** Variant analysis comparing the "actual path" of high-priority jobs against what an optimal path would look like. Conformance checking against a "priority-aware" model. Filtering activities by `Order Priority` and analyzing their `Queue Entry` to `Task Start` times.

*   **Suboptimal Sequencing (Setup Time Impact):**
    *   **Evidence:** The "Sequence-Dependent Setup Times" analysis will show that actual setup durations are highly variable and often longer than planned, particularly when transitioning between dissimilar jobs. This will be quantifiable by grouping actual setup times based on the preceding job's characteristics.
    *   **Process Mining:** Statistical analysis of actual setup durations vs. planned, specifically correlating them with the type of preceding job. Trace alignment on resources to see where significant setup times occur between jobs that *could* have been grouped.

*   **Starvation of Downstream Resources:**
    *   **Evidence:** Downstream machines occasionally show periods of low utilization (idle time) while upstream bottlenecks are heavily loaded. This indicates that jobs are not flowing smoothly from one stage to the next due to upstream delays.
    *   **Process Mining:** Resource utilization over time plots for sequential resources. Analyzing `Queue Entry` times for downstream resources and finding long periods of inactivity when upstream resources are active but not releasing jobs to that specific queue.

*   **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:**
    *   **Evidence:** Fluctuations in queue lengths and WIP levels at different work centers that amplify as you move downstream, leading to periods of congestion followed by periods of starvation.
    *   **Process Mining:** Visualizing the number of `Case ID`s simultaneously in a `Queue Entry` state for various machines over time. This would show dynamic WIP levels across the shop floor.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

Process mining is excellent at differentiating between issues caused by poor scheduling logic versus those caused by resource capacity limitations or inherent process variability.

*   **Limitations of Existing Static Dispatching Rules:**
    *   **Evidence:** The observed pathologies (poor prioritization, suboptimal sequencing) are direct symptoms. If the current rules are "First-Come-First-Served" (FCFS) or simple "Earliest Due Date" (EDD), their ineffectiveness in a complex environment with sequence-dependent setups and dynamic priorities will be evident from the performance metrics (e.g., high tardiness even with EDD, long setups with FCFS).
    *   **Process Mining:** Comparing the *actual* execution order on a resource to the theoretical order dictated by a simple dispatching rule. Deviations, especially for high-priority or late jobs, indicate the rule's failure to adapt.

*   **Lack of Real-time Visibility:**
    *   **Evidence:** This isn't directly observable in the log, but inferred from the pathologies. If decisions are made locally at each work center without knowing the status of other queues or future resource availability, it leads to issues like starvation or overloaded bottlenecks.
    *   **Process Mining:** The *absence* of real-time dynamic adjustments in the execution logs (e.g., jobs not being rerouted, priorities not being re-evaluated in response to disruptions) points to this root cause.

*   **Inaccurate Task Duration or Setup Time Estimations:**
    *   **Evidence:** Significant discrepancies between `Task Duration (Planned)` and `Task Duration (Actual)`, and similarly for setups. Consistently underestimating task or setup times leads to unrealistic schedules that quickly fall apart.
    *   **Process Mining:** Statistical analysis of `Actual Task Duration` vs. `Planned Task Duration` (and setup times). If the actual is consistently higher or highly variable for certain tasks/resources, it indicates poor estimation or unrecognized variability.

*   **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:**
    *   **Evidence:** The "Sequence-Dependent Setup Times" analysis will clearly show that setups are not uniform. If the scheduling logic doesn't account for this (e.g., by trying to group similar jobs), long setup times will frequently occur.
    *   **Process Mining:** Visualizing the sequence of jobs on a machine and noting the associated setup times. If no pattern emerges to minimize setups, the handling is ineffective.

*   **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers:**
    *   **Evidence:** Starvation of downstream resources while upstream is burdened. This suggests that jobs aren't being "pulled" efficiently or "pushed" intelligently.
    *   **Process Mining:** Analyzing the time a job spends *between* activities on different machines (transfer time + waiting time). If this is significant and variable, it points to coordination issues.

*   **Inadequate Strategies for Responding to Unplanned Disruptions:**
    *   **Evidence:** When a `Breakdown Start` event occurs, the subsequent jobs in the affected machine's queue either sit idle for the breakdown duration *or* are manually re-prioritized/re-routed in an ad-hoc manner, leading to cascading delays for other jobs. The `Priority Change` events leading to subsequent chaos rather than smooth re-prioritization are a clear sign.
    *   **Process Mining:** Tracing the *consequences* of disruption events on subsequent job timelines, queue lengths, and due date adherence for *all* affected jobs.

**Differentiating Root Causes:**
*   **Capacity Limitations vs. Scheduling Logic:** If a bottleneck machine has consistently high utilization *and* long queues, *even when the scheduling logic attempts to keep it busy*, then it points to a fundamental capacity limitation. If, however, the machine has periods of high utilization and long queues *interspersed with idle periods*, or if high-priority jobs are delayed *despite available capacity*, then it points to a scheduling logic issue (e.g., poor prioritization, bad sequencing, or starvation). Process mining provides the granular data on utilization, queue times, and activity sequences to make this distinction.
*   **Process Variability:** By analyzing the distribution of `Actual Task Duration` and `Actual Setup Duration`, I can quantify inherent variability. If a task's duration has a high standard deviation, that's inherent variability. If average actuals consistently exceed planned, that's estimation inaccuracy. Process mining helps quantify and visualize this.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

Here are three distinct, sophisticated strategies informed by process mining:

#### Strategy 1: Dynamic, Multi-Factor Prioritization (Enhanced Dispatching Rules)

*   **Core Logic:** Move beyond simple EDD/FCFS to a dynamic prioritization rule that assigns a "priority score" to each waiting job. This score is recalculated in real-time or near real-time whenever a machine becomes free or a significant event occurs (new job arrival, priority change, breakdown). The job with the highest score is processed next.
*   **How it Uses Process Mining Data/Insights:**
    *   **Due Date Closeness:** `Order Due Date` vs. `Current Timestamp`. Process mining reveals the magnitude of tardiness, emphasizing the need for due date consideration.
    *   **Remaining Processing Time (Shortest/Longest Remaining Processing Time):** Sum of `Planned Task Duration` (or refined estimates from PM analysis) for all subsequent tasks in the job's routing. PM quantifies task durations and their variability.
    *   **Order Priority:** `Order Priority` from the log directly informs this. PM shows how current priorities are *not* being effectively honored.
    *   **Downstream Machine Load:** Insights from PM on `Queue Entry` lengths at subsequent machines for the current job's routing. This helps prevent starvation or excessive WIP buildup downstream.
    *   **Estimated Sequence-Dependent Setup Time:** This is critical. PM analysis of historical setups provides the average/predicted setup time for a given (previous job type, current job type) transition on that specific machine. The rule can penalize jobs that require long setups relative to the previously completed job.
    *   **Bottleneck Awareness:** If a machine is identified as a bottleneck by PM (high utilization, long queues), its priority function could be weighted to favor jobs that keep it busy or jobs that release capacity quickly.
*   **Addresses Specific Pathologies:**
    *   Poor task prioritization: Directly addresses by incorporating `Order Priority` and `Due Date` into the decision.
    *   Inefficient resource utilization: Balances flow by considering downstream load and preventing starvation.
    *   Unpredictable lead times: By optimizing flow, lead times become more stable.
    *   High tardiness: Explicitly prioritizes jobs to meet due dates.
*   **Expected Impact on KPIs:**
    *   **Tardiness:** Significant reduction, especially for high-priority/urgent jobs.
    *   **WIP:** Moderate reduction due to better flow balance.
    *   **Lead Time:** More predictable and potentially shorter average lead times.
    *   **Utilization:** More balanced utilization across machines, particularly at bottlenecks.

#### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Dynamic Capacity Adjustment

*   **Core Logic:** Generate a predictive schedule for a rolling horizon (e.g., 24-72 hours) based on historical task duration distributions and *predicted* machine availability. When a significant deviation (e.g., breakdown, hot job, task taking longer than predicted) occurs, the schedule is dynamically re-optimized or adjusted. This is a look-ahead approach.
*   **How it Uses Process Mining Data/Insights:**
    *   **Realistic Task Duration Distributions:** Instead of single-point estimates, PM provides actual duration distributions (e.g., Normal, Gamma, Weibull) for each `Activity/Task` on each `Resource (Machine ID)`. This includes understanding variability. These distributions are fed into a predictive model (e.g., a simulation engine or a data-driven predictive model).
    *   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Model:** The quantified setup times from PM analysis are integrated into the predictive model.
    *   **Breakdown Frequencies and Durations:** PM analysis of `Breakdown Start/End` provides historical frequency and duration distributions for each machine, which can be fed into a predictive maintenance model or used for probabilistic scheduling.
    *   **Resource Contention:** PM highlights historical periods of resource contention. The predictive model can anticipate future contention.
    *   **Routing Flexibility:** If jobs have alternative routings (e.g., can go to MILL-01 or MILL-02), PM can analyze historical usage of these alternatives.
*   **Addresses Specific Pathologies:**
    *   Unpredictable lead times: Directly addresses by providing more accurate completion time estimates.
    *   High tardiness: Proactively identifies potential delays, allowing for mitigation actions (e.g., re-prioritization, rerouting) before they become critical.
    *   Inefficient resource utilization: Optimizes resource allocation over a horizon, considering future demand and potential disruptions.
    *   Disruptions: Enables proactive response and rescheduling when breakdowns or urgent jobs occur.
*   **Expected Impact on KPIs:**
    *   **Tardiness:** Significantly reduced due to proactive problem identification and resolution.
    *   **WIP:** Potentially lower as jobs are pushed through more smoothly according to a global plan.
    *   **Lead Time:** Highly predictable and potentially shorter average lead times.
    *   **Utilization:** Optimized and balanced utilization, reducing both overload and starvation.

#### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimized Batching & Sequencing

*   **Core Logic:** At machines identified as having significant sequence-dependent setup times (e.g., CNC Milling, Lathing, Grinding), jobs are intelligently batched or sequenced to minimize total setup time. This might involve holding a job briefly to wait for a similar job to arrive or prioritizing a job that requires a minimal setup change from the currently running job.
*   **How it Uses Process Mining Data/Insights:**
    *   **Quantified Sequence-Dependent Setups:** The detailed analysis of setup times based on (previous job type, current job type) transitions is the cornerstone. This data informs the "cost" of each transition.
    *   **Job Similarity Metrics:** Develop metrics (e.g., material, dimensions, tooling requirements) for jobs based on historical attributes in the logs. PM can reveal which attributes are most correlated with setup time.
    *   **Throughput Analysis for Bottlenecks:** This strategy is particularly powerful at bottlenecks. PM helps identify these machines.
*   **Addresses Specific Pathologies:**
    *   Suboptimal sequencing leading to increased setup times: Directly addresses this by intelligent grouping.
    *   High WIP: By reducing non-productive setup time, flow improves, potentially lowering WIP.
    *   Inefficient resource utilization: Converts setup time (non-productive) into productive processing time, improving throughput for critical machines.
*   **Expected Impact on KPIs:**
    *   **Tardiness:** Reduced due to increased productive capacity, especially at bottleneck machines.
    *   **WIP:** Moderate reduction as jobs flow faster through setup-intensive stages.
    *   **Lead Time:** Potentially shorter overall lead times due to reduced non-productive time.
    *   **Utilization:** Significantly improved utilization (productive time percentage) on machines with high setup costs.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

#### Simulation and Evaluation:

Before live deployment, rigorous testing of the proposed strategies is crucial using **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)**. DES is ideal because it models the discrete flow of jobs and resources over time, mirroring the job shop environment.

*   **Parameterization with Process Mining Data:**
    *   **Job Arrival Process:** Derived from `Job Released` event timestamps (e.g., inter-arrival time distributions).
    *   **Job Routings:** Discovered process models (sequences of activities for different job types).
    *   **Task Duration Distributions:** From PM analysis of `Actual Task Duration` (e.g., empirical distributions, or fitted theoretical distributions).
    *   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Models:** The quantified lookup tables or functions from PM (e.g., setup time from Job A to B on Machine X).
    *   **Resource Availability:** Number of machines, operators, and their `Breakdown Frequencies and Durations` derived from PM.
    *   **Order Priority Distribution:** Based on historical `Order Priority` in the logs.
    *   **Due Date Assignment Logic:** How due dates are typically assigned based on historical data.

*   **Simulation Scenarios:**
    *   **Baseline Scenario:** Simulate the current scheduling logic (simple dispatching rules) using the mined parameters to establish a quantifiable baseline performance.
    *   **Proposed Strategies:** Simulate each of the three proposed strategies individually.
    *   **Stress Testing:**
        *   **High Load:** Increase job arrival rates to test performance under congestion.
        *   **Frequent Disruptions:** Increase breakdown frequencies or introduce more urgent jobs.
        *   **Specific Job Mix:** Simulate periods with a high proportion of jobs requiring long setups or particular bottleneck resources.
        *   **Resource Shortages:** Simulate reduced operator availability or fewer machines.
    *   **Performance Comparison:** Compare KPIs (Tardiness, WIP, Lead Time, Resource Utilization) for each strategy and scenario against the baseline and against each other. Visualization of queues, Gantt charts of machine usage, and job progress will be crucial.

#### Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:

Implementation is not a one-time event. A framework for continuous monitoring and adaptation is essential.

*   **Ongoing Process Mining for Monitoring KPIs:**
    *   **Automated KPI Dashboards:** Develop real-time or daily dashboards using fresh MES event logs. These dashboards would track the key KPIs: Tardiness (overall and by priority), On-Time Delivery Rate, Average/Max Lead Time, WIP levels at each work center, Machine Utilization (productive vs. idle vs. setup), Queue Lengths.
    *   **Conformance Checking:** Continuously compare the *actual* process execution (from new logs) against the *ideal* process models defined by the new scheduling strategy. Deviations highlight where the strategy is not being followed or is failing.
    *   **Drift Detection:** Implement automated process mining algorithms (e.g., concept drift detection) to identify when:
        *   Task duration distributions change significantly (e.g., new materials, new operators, machine wear).
        *   Setup time patterns change (e.g., new product types, changes in tooling).
        *   Breakdown patterns shift (e.g., increasing frequency for a particular machine).
        *   Queueing behavior deviates from expected (e.g., a previously non-bottleneck machine starts accumulating queues).
    *   **Root Cause Drilling:** When a KPI dips or a drift is detected, use detailed process mining to drill down into the specific cases, resources, and activities causing the issue. For example, if tardiness increases, analyze the specific jobs that were late and identify bottlenecks or specific operations that contributed.

*   **Adaptation and Adjustment:**
    *   **Re-parameterization:** If PM detects significant changes in process parameters (e.g., task durations), the scheduling model's input parameters should be updated.
    *   **Rule Tuning:** Based on KPI performance and drift detection, the weighting factors in the Dynamic Multi-Factor Prioritization strategy could be adjusted.
    *   **Strategy Refinement:** If persistent pathologies arise, it might indicate a need to refine the core scheduling logic or even consider incorporating elements from other strategies. For instance, if Setup Time Optimization strategy works well but predictive capability is still weak, integrate elements of Strategy 2.
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Establish a continuous feedback loop where operations managers review the dashboards and process mining insights, providing feedback to the scheduling system and prompting adjustments. This makes the system truly adaptive and ensures it remains effective in a dynamic job shop environment.

By implementing this comprehensive data-driven approach, Precision Parts Inc. can move from reactive, ad-hoc scheduling to a proactive, intelligent, and continuously optimizing system, drastically improving its operational performance and customer satisfaction.
