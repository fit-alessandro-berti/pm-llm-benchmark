Based on the provided data, it seems there are several steps involved in handling packages/purchases/transactions related to items being sold online or through an e-commerce platform:

Here's a breakdown of typical transaction workflows derived from the given frequency (number of events) counts and duration statistics:
  
1. **Order Creation**: The process starts with either initiating payment for an order (`pay order`) often followed by confirming the creation of packages (`confirm order`).

2. **Payment Process**: `pay order`, `place order`, `create package`, `send package`: These are various stages related to the completion and fulfillment of orders. This might include creating packages (`create package`) first then sending them for delivery (`send package`). There seems inconsistencies in some actions like `create package` being performed (`frequency = 699`) while another action like `place order` precedes it (`frequency = 685`). This could indicate a more complex process that's not completely linear.

3. **Order Fulfillment**: Once payment is made (`pay order`, `confirm order`), the order goes through steps such as:
    - **Package Creation**: A package might be created (`create package`) first followed by sending it (`send package`).
    - **Package Delivery Notification**: This could involve a notification of package delivery (`package delivered`) initiating another process related to picking up items (`pick item`). It's also possible that `package delivered` is notified after placing an order (`place order`) or creating packages (`create package`), which then triggers pickup (`send package`). The `pick item` step might be what leads to picking items for delivery or collection.
    
4. **Pick and Delivery**: This involves the actual physical pick-up of purchased items (`pick item`) followed by sending them (`send package`) until they reach their final destination (`package delivered`).

5. **Order Completion**: The `send package` action often leads (`duration = approximately average time`) to the delivery notification (`package delivered`). This seems to be part of the process where packages are handled (`create package`, `send package`, then delivered) indicating various stages involved from creation of packages (`create package`) onward (`send package`) until they reach their end destination (`package delivered`).

6. **Return Process**: There could also be actions relating to returns, which involve picking items (`pick item`) before sending them (`send package`). The data does not mention this specifically but given the presence of pickup and delivery cycles (`pick`, `send`) it might imply some form of returns or exchanges are part of transactions too.

The overall picture suggests a complex yet sequential process involving payment handling (`pay order`, `place order`), package creation (`create package`, `send package`, `confirm order`) leading to their physical handling (`pick item`) followed by delivery notification (`package delivered`). The process might involve multiple steps with different actions sometimes taking place simultaneously (`pay`, `send`, `confirm`; `pick`, `send`, `delivered`).

Please note that the process seems quite intricate involving a range of activities related both upstream/downstream in transaction lifecycle along with possible interactivity between transactions themselves (`frequency counts`). The actual timeline and sequence may vary based on different factors including platforms involved (`e-commerce platform`, `marketplace`, etc.)
