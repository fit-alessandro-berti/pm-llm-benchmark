Below is one example of an integrated event log. In this example we assume that every order (identified by its order_id) is a case that progresses through several activities. We map the source tables as follows and—when possible—look up the human names for the various resource IDs (using the Resources table):

•Orders  “Order Created” (with order_date as the event timestamp, sales_person as resource, plus some order attributes)  
•Order Lines  “Item Picked” (one event per order line, using item_picking_date, warehouse staff as resource; details include item_id and quantity)  
•Delivery  Two events per delivery record (one “Order Dispatched” using delivery_dispatch_date and one “Order Arrived” using delivery_arrival_date; the carrier becomes the resource and we include the delivery note)  
•Invoice  “Invoice Issued” (using invoice_issue_date and the billing person as resource; details include invoice_amount)  
•Payments  “Payment Received” (using payment_date; we include the payment_method and payment_reference in the details)

Any ambiguity (for example, payments having no direct resource) is handled by labeling that event with a generic “System/Payment” actor.

Below is the final event log sorted per case (order) and then chronologically. (Assumptions:  
– We assume that the “Order Created” event carries key customer and priority information.  
– For payments, no individual person is given in the payment record so we simply label these events by “System/Payment.”)

Notes and Assumptions:  
1. The order_id is used as the Case ID.  
2. For orders with multiple order lines, a separate “Item Picked” event is recorded for each line.  
3. Each delivery record generates two events (dispatched and arrived) with the same delivery note included in the details.  
4. Payments are linked via the invoice_id in the Invoice table. No explicit resource is provided for payments; hence they are tagged as “System/Payment.”  
5. Where available, resource IDs have been cross-referenced with the Resources table to include names and roles.

This log can now serve as a foundation for process mining, showing the entire lifecycle from order creation to payment receipt.
