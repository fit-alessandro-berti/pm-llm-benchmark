Excellent. Based on the provided interview transcripts, here is a structured, BPMN-like textual description of the invoice approval process.

### **BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval**

This model consolidates the perspectives of the Accounts Payable Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, AP Supervisor, and Supplier Relationship Manager.

---

#### **1. Process Overview**

The process handles the validation, approval, and scheduling for payment of supplier invoices. It begins when an invoice is received and ends when the approved invoice is scheduled for payment. The process involves multiple departments and has specific sub-processes for handling exceptions like missing information or discrepancies.

#### **2. Pools and Lanes (Participants)**

*   **Pool:** Invoice Processing
    *   **Lane: Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk** (Primary process owner; performs initial checks, data entry, matching, and final scheduling)
    *   **Lane: Purchasing Officer** (Responsible for confirming receipt of goods/services and verifying invoice details against the Purchase Order)
    *   **Lane: Department Manager** (Provides final business approval for the expenditure)
    *   **Lane: AP Supervisor** (Manages complex exceptions and escalations)
    *   **Lane: Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)** (Assists in resolving supplier-related discrepancies)
*   **External Participant:** **Supplier** (Initiates the process by sending an invoice and is contacted for corrections)
*   **System:** **Accounting System** (Used for logging invoices and sending automated notifications)

---

#### **3. Artifacts (Data Objects)**

*   **[Data Object] Invoice:** The primary document received from the supplier.
*   **[Data Object] Purchase Order (PO):** The internal document used for verification.

---

#### **4. Process Flow Description**

**Start Event:** **Invoice Received**
*   **Trigger:** An invoice is received, typically via email.
*   **Participant:** AP Clerk

**(Lane: AP Clerk)**

**1. Task: Initial Invoice Triage**
*   The AP Clerk reviews the incoming invoice.

**2. Gateway (Exclusive): Is a valid Purchase Order (PO) number present?**
*   **Condition: YES** (PO is present) -> The process continues to **Task 3**.
*   **Condition: NO** (PO is missing or invalid) -> The process follows an exception path.
    *   **If the invoice is for standard goods/services:**
        *   **Task: Request PO from Supplier.** The AP Clerk contacts the supplier to request a revised invoice with a valid PO number.
        *   **End Event: Awaiting Corrected Invoice.** (The process for this specific invoice instance may terminate or pause here).
    *   **If the invoice is for informally contracted services (as per AP Supervisor):**
        *   **Handoff to: AP Supervisor** for exception handling (See Exception Path 1 below).

**(Lane: AP Clerk)**

**3. Task: Log Invoice in Accounting System**
*   The AP Clerk enters the invoice details into the accounting system.

**4. Task: Forward Invoice for Goods Receipt Confirmation**
*   The AP Clerk forwards the invoice (or a notification) to the Purchasing department.
*   **Handoff to: Purchasing Officer**

**(Lane: Purchasing Officer)**

**5. Task: Confirm Goods/Services Receipt & Verify Invoice**
*   The Purchasing Officer checks internal records to confirm the goods or services were delivered.
*   They compare the invoice (quantities, prices, charges) against the corresponding PO.

**6. Gateway (Exclusive): Do invoice details match the PO and receipt records?**
*   **Condition: YES** (Match is confirmed)
    *   **Task: Send Confirmation to AP.** The Purchasing Officer sends a confirmation email or system notification back to the AP Clerk.
    *   **Handoff to: AP Clerk**. The process continues to **Task 7**.
*   **Condition: NO** (Discrepancy found)
    *   **Handoff to: AP Clerk/Purchasing/SRM** for discrepancy resolution (See Exception Path 2 below).

**(Lane: AP Clerk)**

**7. Task: Match Invoice to PO in System**
*   Triggered by confirmation from Purchasing.
*   The AP Clerk performs a formal three-way match (Invoice vs. PO vs. Goods Receipt Confirmation) within the accounting system.
*   *Note: This task appears to be a formal system-based version of the verification done by Purchasing.*

**8. Gateway (Exclusive): Is the three-way match successful?**
*   **Condition: YES** (Match is successful) -> The process continues to **Task 9**.
*   **Condition: NO** (Discrepancy remains)
    *   **Gateway (Exclusive): Is discrepancy simple or complex?**
        *   **Simple:** **Task: Request Clarification from Purchasing.** A communication loop is initiated.
        *   **Complex/Unresolved:** **Task: Escalate to AP Supervisor.**
        *   **Handoff to: AP Supervisor** for advanced exception handling (See Exception Path 2).

**(System Task / AP Clerk)**

**9. Task: Send for Manager Approval**
*   The accounting system automatically generates and sends an approval request to the relevant Department Manager.
*   **Handoff to: Department Manager**

**(Lane: Department Manager)**

**10. Task: Review and Approve Invoice**
*   The Manager reviews the invoice, PO, and confirmation details within the system.

**11. Gateway (Exclusive): Managerial Decision**
*   **Condition: APPROVED**
    *   The Manager clicks "Approve" in the system.
    *   **Handoff to: AP Clerk**. The process continues to **Task 12**.
*   **Condition: REJECTED / HOLD**
    *   **Task: Request Investigation from AP.** The Manager rejects the invoice and adds comments requesting further investigation from the AP Clerk.
    *   The process loops back to the AP Clerk's lane for re-evaluation, potentially before **Task 7**.

**(Lane: AP Clerk)**

**12. Task: Schedule Invoice for Payment**
*   Triggered by the Manager's approval.
*   The AP Clerk adds the approved invoice to the next payment run.

**End Event: Invoice Scheduled for Payment**

#### **5. Exception Paths and Sub-Processes**

**Exception Path 1: No Purchase Order**
*   **Trigger:** An invoice for informally contracted services arrives without a PO.
*   **Participant:** AP Supervisor
*   **Sub-Process: Resolve No-PO Invoice**
    1.  **Task:** The AP Supervisor receives the escalated invoice from the AP Clerk.
    2.  **Task:** Coordinate with Department Head to validate the service/charge.
    3.  **Task:** Create a retrospective PO or gain formal authorization.
    4.  **Merge:** The invoice, now with a valid PO or authorization, is sent back to the AP Clerk to re-enter the main flow at **Task 3: Log Invoice in Accounting System**.

**Exception Path 2: Invoice Discrepancy (Price, Quantity, etc.)**
*   **Trigger:** Discrepancy found by either Purchasing (**Task 6**) or AP Clerk (**Task 8**).
*   **Participants:** AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, AP Supervisor, Supplier Relationship Manager
*   **Sub-Process: Resolve Discrepancy**
    1.  **Task: Initiate Contact for Resolution.**
        *   *Note: There is some ambiguity. Purchasing may contact the supplier directly, or they may ask the AP Clerk to hold the invoice while they investigate. If the issue is contractual, the SRM may be looped in.*
    2.  **Task (Parallel):**
        *   **(AP Clerk/Purchasing):** Hold the invoice payment process.
        *   **(Purchasing/SRM/AP Supervisor):** Coordinate to resolve the issue. This may involve:
            *   **Task:** Contacting the supplier for a corrected invoice.
            *   **Task (SRM):** Verifying contractual terms (e.g., pricing).
            *   **Task (AP Supervisor):** Mediating internal disagreements between AP and Purchasing.
    3.  **Gateway (Exclusive): Is the discrepancy resolved?**
        *   **Condition: YES**
            *   **Merge:** The process returns to the main flow. If a corrected invoice is received, it may loop back to **Task 3**. If it's a clarification, it merges back right before **Task 9: Send for Manager Approval**.
        *   **Condition: NO**
            *   **End Event: Invoice Rejected (Discrepancy Unresolved).** The invoice is formally rejected and returned to the supplier.
