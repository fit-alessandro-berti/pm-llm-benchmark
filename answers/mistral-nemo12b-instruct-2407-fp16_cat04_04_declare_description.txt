Based on the provided declarative process model constraints, here's a description of the underlying process:

**Process Name:** Declaration and Payment Process

**Actors:**
1. Employee
2. Supervisor (SUPERVISOR)
3. Pre-Approver (PRE_APPROVER)
4. Administrator (ADMINISTRATION)
5. Budget Owner (BUDGET OWNER)
6. Missing (MISSING)

**Process Steps:**

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
   - The process begins when an employee submits a declaration.

2. **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER / ADMINISTRATION / SUPERVISOR / BUDGET OWNER / MISSING** (Absent in the model)
   - These activities are not part of the modeled process, but they might be involved in other scenarios or versions of the process.

3. **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER / ADMINISTRATION / SUPERVISOR / BUDGET OWNER / EMPLOYEE / MISSING** (Absent in the model)
   - Similar to above, these activities are not part of the modeled process.

4. **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE** (Absent in the model)
   - This activity is also not part of the modeled process.

5. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
   - The supervisor approves the declaration, marking it as final.
   - *Existence*: This activity must occur at least once.
   - *Exactly 1*: This activity occurs exactly one time.
   - *Initialization*: The process can start with this activity (though it's not typical).
   - *Responded Existence* and *Response*: If the declaration is submitted, it will be final-approved by the supervisor. If the declaration is final-approved, it was previously submitted.
   - *Precedence*, *Chain Precedence*, *Alternate Precedence*, *Succession*, *Alternate Succession*, *Chain Succession*: The declaration must be submitted before it can be final-approved by the supervisor.

6. **Request Payment**
   - A request for payment is made.
   - *Existence* and *Exactly 1*: This activity occurs exactly one time.
   - *Responded Existence*, *Response*, *Precedence*, *Chain Precedence*, *Alternate Precedence*, *Succession*, *Alternate Succession*, *Chain Succession*, *Co-Existence*: The payment request is made after the declaration is submitted and final-approved, and before or simultaneously with the payment being handled.

7. **Payment Handled**
   - The requested payment is processed.
   - *Existence* and *Exactly 1*: This activity occurs exactly one time.
   - *Responded Existence*, *Response*, *Precedence*, *Chain Precedence*, *Alternate Precedence*, *Succession*, *Alternate Succession*, *Chain Succession*, *Co-Existence*: The payment is handled after the payment request is made and after the declaration is final-approved.

In summary, the process involves an employee submitting a declaration, which is then final-approved by a supervisor. After that, a payment request is made, and finally, the payment is handled. The process model ensures that these activities occur in the correct order and with the specified cardinalities.
