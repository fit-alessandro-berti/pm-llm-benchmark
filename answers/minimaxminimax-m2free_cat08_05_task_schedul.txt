I need to clearly outline the structure of the response, covering five subsections and starting with a scenario summary. For section one, I’ll discuss the process mining pipeline, including event log enrichment, flow and resource graphs, and various metrics like throughput and resource utilization. 

I'll define the events, data mapping, event log preprocessing, and then delve into flow and resource perspectives, highlighting process variants and comparisons. It’s all about making it structured and easy to digest!

I need to outline several techniques for measuring schedule adherence and addressing disruptions. This includes using baseline metrics like tardiness frequency and schedule adherence ratio. 

I’ll also consider deviating from planned sequences, like measuring tasks that took longer than expected. For disruptions, I’ll analyze recovery times and include measures for breakdowns and urgent job injections. Additionally, I plan to use causal discovery techniques, propose conformance checking against schedules, and compare actual task durations with planned times using the C2G miner.

In my analysis, I’ll focus on transitioning from resource events to task resource and operator ID events. I'll provide details on specific metrics to measure job flow times and waiting times, such as queue wait times and resource utilization. 

It's essential to evaluate sequence-dependent setups by constructing transition matrices and ensuring that the difference between planned and actual durations is highlighted. I’ll wrap up section one with a quick summary to encapsulate the key points effectively.

For section two, I’m outlining scheduling pathologies to diagnose bottlenecks by examining throughput versus capacity and queue times. I'll consider techniques like utilizing limited lookahead strategies to create time-phased nets while accounting for setups through parameterized weights. 

When facing urgent jobs, the risk of starvating downstream resources arises due to complex sequencing, particularly in low volume scenarios. I’ll implement variants like having a dedicated worker, exploring bidirectional flow, and ensuring careful routing to mitigate issues and evaluate progress effectively.

I’m planning to summarize and organize my thoughts with smooth, clear sentences in the final document. I'll use bullet points to outline key components like heuristics and activation thresholds while focusing on process mining analysis. 

The insights will drive the design and weighting of factors, and I want to emphasize expected impacts on key performance indicators. I'll also include a summary for each section to highlight takeaways. It's important to maintain a moderate verbosity but still provide comprehensive details throughout the content. Now, it’s time to dive in and start writing!

# Data-driven scheduling uplift for Precision Parts Inc.

A pragmatic path to lower tardiness and WIP while increasing throughput and predictability is to marry process mining with predictive scheduling. Below is a concrete plan that uses the company’s MES logs to quantify the current scheduling performance, diagnose pathologies, and implement three advanced strategies—plus a simulation-and-control loop to validate and continuously improve them in production.

---

## 1. Analyzing historical scheduling performance and dynamics

Start by turning the event log into a trustworthy, unified dataset and then read it through multiple process-mining lenses. The goal is not to “visualize” the shop, but to measure what is happening against what should happen and quantify how scheduling choices translate into tardiness, WIP, and uneven utilization.

A. Data preparation and integrity
- Normalize and align timestamps to a common time base; handle daylight saving or MES clock skew if any.
- Enrich each event with process metadata (job class, part family, material, operation sequence order, job size, customer segment, due date, promised lead time, priority class) so that context-aware models can be built.
- Resolve resource and capacity identifiers: machines (e.g., CUT-01), work centers (e.g., Cutting), operators, and any shared fixtures or fixtures-to-job mappings that influence setup times.
- Build the job trajectory graph: link Setup Start, Setup End, Task Start, Task End, and Queue Entry events by job ID and operation order to reconstruct the actual routing and execution sequence.
- Distinguish wait times, transport times, and operator idle periods; if operator logs exist, use them to identify coordination constraints.
- Identify exceptional behaviors explicitly: breakdowns, priority changes, manual interventions, and re-schedules.

B. Perspectives to analyze
- Flow perspective (case-centric): reconstruct job routes and timelines; compare variants by due date class or priority.
- Resource perspective (machine/operator-centric): reconstruct load curves, utilization, and sequence transitions.
- Timing perspective (waiting, processing, setup durations).
- Exception perspective (breakdowns, urgent jobs).
- Conformance perspective (planned versus actual durations and sequences).

C. Key process mining techniques
- Variant and process discovery:
  - The classic process maps show what is actually happening on the shop floor. Contrast variants that finish on-time versus those that are late to isolate sequencing or bottleneck issues.
  - Annotated transition graphs with performance metrics visualize where waits cluster and where there is high setup variability.
- Conformance checking:
  - Align the event log with the intended routing and planned durations to detect deviations (skipped setups, unplanned rework, re-sequencing).
- Performance spectrum analysis and sequence-mining:
  - Use the performance spectrum to spot hotspots of long waits and make work-to-compliance decisions.
  - Mine frequent subsequences of job attributes or part codes preceding certain operations to identify patterns that trigger long setups or late completions.
- Resource and operator timeline mining:
  - Build utilization timelines per machine and per operator; split productive versus idle versus setup time.
  - Identify contention windows (queues and busy intervals) that correlate with downstream starvation or local tardiness.

D. Metrics to compute
- Job flow times, lead times, and makespan distributions:
  - For each job: flow time (Job Released to last Task End) and due-date-related measures like tardiness, lateness, and early flow time.
  - Make-span per work center and for the full job.
  - Compare distributions by part family, priority, and machine to understand variability drivers.
- Task waiting times (queue times) at each work center/machine:
  - Queue time = max(Setup Start, Task Start)  (immediately preceding event that signals readiness).
  - Aggregate per work center and machine; identify stations with the highest median queue times and worst tail behavior.
- Resource utilization (machine and operator):
  - Productive time = processing time where a valid Task StartTask End is recorded.
  - Setup time = Setup StartSetup End.
  - Idle time = gaps not explained by breakdowns or planned downtime.
  - Utilization = productive time / available time (exclude planned downtime and breakdowns). Record setup percentage to monitor changeovers.
- Sequence-dependent setup times:
  - For every machine, build a transition matrix with setup duration as the target. Label transitions by properties such as prior part family, material type, tool state, or customer class.
  - Extract top predictors of long setups (e.g., switching between families or materials; tool changes).
  - Compute total setup time loss due to suboptimal sequences by simulating optimal or “neighboring” sequences (see Strategy 3).
- Schedule adherence and tardiness:
  - Tardiness (positive only), lateness (signed), and schedule adherence ratio = proportion of jobs meeting planned finish.
  - Weighted tardiness by priority class or revenue.
  - Measure the impact of disruptions: for each breakdown window, compute the additional tardiness accrued on affected jobs and downstream jobs.
- Impact of disruptions:
  - For each breakdown event, compute:
    - Affected jobs: those whose next operation requires the machine.
    - Recovery time: time to return to a pre-breakdown throughput level.
    - Cascading lateness: measured as the delta between median lateness before and after the event, for a rolling window of 5–10 days.
  - For urgent jobs, measure “priority inversion”: high-priority jobs elevated too late, causing late completion; quantify how many on-time jobs are displaced.
  - Use influence analysis (regression-based or score-based) to separate the effect of disruptions from variance in demand or WIP.

E. Outputs that feed scheduling decisions
- Identify the key bottleneck(s) with their capacity gap and queue statistics.
- Extract machine- and part-family-dependent setup duration models (formulae or simple ML regressors).
- Build predictive distributions of task duration per operation per machine, optionally conditioned on operator and job complexity.
- Characterize disruption frequencies, durations, and impact on job families.

## 2. Diagnosing scheduling pathologies

The metrics above surface structural and behavioral issues in the current “local FCFS/EDD” policy. Use targeted analyses to get evidence, not anecdotes.

- Bottlenecks and uneven load:
  - Look for machines with sustained utilization > 85–90%, long tails in queue time distributions, and a disproportionately high percentage of total setup time.
  - Use performance spectrum hotspots to confirm persistent waiting and cross-validate with makespan increases for jobs that pass through those stations.
- Suboptimal sequencing and setup penalties:
  - On bottleneck machines, compute the cost of not considering sequence-dependent setups: sum all observed setups and compare against a greedy “traveling salesman on a job graph” improvement that groups similar jobs.
  - Check whether frequent early deadlines are starved by large batches of earlier jobs (blocking and starving late jobs).
- Starvation of downstream resources:
  - Identify stations whose utilization is low, yet jobs that must pass through them are consistently late. This often indicates that upstream sequencing releases batches too late or in a sequence that triggers long setups down the line.
- Priority inversion and poor due-date coordination:
  - Compare on-time vs. late jobs for the same due-date windows. If late jobs were often behind long setup jobs or behind later-released hot jobs, the local priority rule is misaligned with overall goals.
  - Measure the correlation between late completions and number of priority changes during execution.
- WIP “bullwhip” and variability amplification:
  - Plot WIP by work center and show where it spikes and decays. If spikes coincide with machine downtimes or high-setup-change batches, upstream dispatching is not dampening variability enough.
- Overuse of setup on flexible machines:
  - Machines advertised as flexible should not show high setup percentages unless diversity of job mix truly demands it. Prolonged idle time with high setup percentages suggests a mismatch between capability and job mix.

Use process-mining evidence to prove these pathologies:
- Bottleneck analysis: show prolonged queue time distributions and high tail percentiles at specific machines (performance spectrum).
- Variant analysis: compare process variants for on-time vs. late jobs; verify whether late jobs are more likely to have longer sequences, more setups, or to go through the same bottleneck machine.
- Resource contention analysis: correlate machine busy intervals with queue growth downstream; quantify “hold” and “delay” relationships between machines.
- Conformance measures: the fraction of jobs that deviated from the planned sequence, and how deviation magnitude correlates with tardiness.

## 3. Root cause analysis of scheduling ineffectiveness

- Static rules vs. dynamic reality:
  - FCFS/EDD ignore context like setup costs, operator skill, and downstream load. The log likely shows small improvement in on-time ratio with higher priority job injections, but worsening queue time tails at the bottleneck. Process mining reveals when FCFS/EDD are sufficient (low utilization, low setup variability) and when they are harmful (bottlenecks, high sequence-dependent setups).
- Limited visibility and coordination:
  - The absence of global resource awareness leads to one station being busy while another is starved. Mining identifies “lonely” queues after big setup blocks at upstream machines.
- Inaccurate estimates and missing setup logic:
  - Compare planned vs. actual task durations and setups. Systematic underestimation signals estimation bias; high variance suggests unmodeled dependencies (operator, tool state, part complexity).
- Ineffective handling of sequence-dependent setups:
  - Many changeovers appear in the log without evidence of grouping or learned sequences. Optimizing ordering at bottlenecks would reduce total setup time without sacrificing throughput.
- Poor disruption response:
  - After breakdowns, the baseline likely reschedules with a “return to FCFS” after the queue re-forms. The log shows that high-priority jobs take too long to be reprioritized; process mining quantifies the recovery lag and identifies which stations are most sensitive.

Process mining helps isolate schedule logic from capacity limits:
- If a machine has high setup percentages and long queues, but other machines in parallel have low utilization and do not pick up slack, the issue is dispatching logic, not capacity.
- If the bottleneck still has long queues even after removing all setups (e.g., simulating an “all-same-family” schedule), capacity constraints are dominant.

## 4. Developing advanced data-driven scheduling strategies

Three complementary strategies form a cohesive scheduling system. Each is informed by the process mining results and directly addresses the diagnosed pathologies.

### Strategy 1: Enhanced dynamic dispatching with learned setup costs (DDS-DD-SET)
Core idea
- At the decision point for a machine, choose the next job using a score that balances urgency, capacity costs, and downstream impact. The key addition is a learned sequence-dependent setup penalty from historical transitions.

How it uses process mining insights
- Setup penalty model: train a lightweight regressor on setup duration at each machine using features such as:
  - Prior job’s part family, material, machine/tool state, operator skill class.
  - Transition direction (continuous changeovers vs. same-family repeats).
- Downstream load predictor: estimate work-in-queue and expected setup+process durations for each downstream machine over a rolling horizon (using recent event rates and disruption probabilities).

Scoring rule
For each eligible job j at machine m:
Score(j) =  × PriorityWeight(priority) +  × DueDateUrgency(RHOj) +  × WorkContent(RPTj,SetupPj,m) +  × DownstreamLoad(downstream(m),j) +  × SetupPenalty(PredictedSetup(m|prev job, j)) +  × ReworkRisk
where:
- PriorityWeight is derived from customer/contract SLAs and revenue; urgent jobs get a non-linear boost.
- DueDateUrgency is defined via RHO = (DueDate  Now)/RemainingProcessingTime; jobs with RHO < 1.2 become increasingly urgent.
- WorkContent = remaining processing time plus estimated setup at the current machine.
- DownstreamLoad is the predicted wait and setup at the next bottleneck for job j; computed from a rolling capacity forecast for the next T hours.
- PredictedSetup is from the transition model; high predicted setups decrease the score unless the job is urgent.
- ReworkRisk is a function of recent compliance failures or rework loops on the same part.

Implementation details
- Threshold activation: use FCFS when utilization is low (e.g., < 60%) and observed setups are short and stable; switch to the score when utilization rises or when setup variance is high.
- Infeasibility guard: avoid deadlocks by a forward-checking test on critical downstream machines.
- Tie-breakers: within ±5% of top score, choose the job with the shortest predicted sequence-dependent setup at the next operation.

Expected impact
- Reduces tardiness for high-priority and near-due-date jobs.
- Lowers setup time on bottleneck machines by avoiding long-changeover sequences.
- Smooths downstream queues, reducing WIP bullwhip.
- Improves utilization balance by preventing large jobs from monopolizing capacity during spikes.

### Strategy 2: Predictive scheduling with probabilistic durations and risk-aware loading
Core idea
- Replace single-point estimates with probabilistic durations and load forecasts. Generate and evaluate multiple schedules under uncertainty to reduce late risk and prevent hidden overloads.

How it uses process mining insights
- Predictive task duration models:
  - Fit distributions by machine, operation type, part family, and operator skill; use parametric (lognormal) or semi-parametric models.
  - Include covariates such as previous setup type, time since tool change, operator idle time, and recent downtime occurrences.
- Disruption models:
  - Estimate breakdown frequencies and durations per machine using historical failure timestamps (e.g., Weibull or nonhomogeneous Poisson process). If this data is sparse, use survival analysis with covariates (operator, machine age, recent maintenance).
- Risk-aware dispatch and sequencing:
  - At scheduling time, simulate the queue by sampling durations from the fitted distributions. Run many trials (e.g., 100–200 Monte Carlo replications) and measure the probability that each job will finish by its due date.
  - Assign or reorder jobs to minimize the expected weighted tardiness under these probabilities, using a rolling-horizon approach (e.g., recompute every 1–2 hours with a 12–24-hour horizon).

Decision-making updates
- Jobs with high tardiness probability receive an additional priority boost or are moved earlier.
- Load leveling across parallel machines is performed by transferring jobs with high risk at a congested machine to a less-loaded one (if capable), even if nominally slower, to protect the due date.

Expected impact
- More accurate lead-time promises and reduced customer complaints.
- Lowered probability of missing critical due dates on high-priority jobs.
- Lower variance in job completion times, improving predictability and reducing late reactions.

### Strategy 3: Intelligent setup-time minimization through sequence clustering at bottlenecks
Core idea
- Reduce total setup time at bottleneck machines by grouping jobs with similar attributes and by using the learned transition penalty to order jobs efficiently.

How it uses process mining insights
- Transition cost matrix: from the event log, construct C(ij) = average setup duration when job i is immediately followed by job j on machine m, conditional on i and j’s part family/material.
- Sequence clustering and routing:
  - Before release or upon arriving at a bottleneck queue, cluster the N jobs into “families” using a fast method (e.g., single linkage with distance = min transition cost to join clusters or k-means over learned embeddings of attributes).
  - Sequence within each cluster using a greedy TSP-inspired local search: for a cluster of size K (often 6–12), try random swaps and accept a swap if total transition time falls.

Heuristics
- Order family batches by a due-date proxy: batch completion deadline = min due dates in the batch plus a small buffer.
- Insert urgent jobs ahead of batches when their due dates are tight; enforce limits on extra setup penalties (e.g., limit intra-batch changeovers to 1–2 transitions).

Synergy with Strategy 1 and 2
- Strategy 3 reduces the predicted setup times used in the dispatching score.
- Strategy 2 updates risk-aware load while Strategy 3 optimizes the order within clusters, stabilizing durations and reducing variance.

Expected impact
- Noticeable reduction in total setup time (often 10–25% on high-setup machines), improving capacity and lowering lead times.
- Lower tail lateness at bottlenecks; jobs relying on them experience fewer extreme queue times.
- Better operator ergonomics and tool management through fewer abrupt changeovers.

## 5. Simulation, evaluation, and continuous improvement

A. Discrete-event simulation to validate and compare strategies
- Build the model:
  - Machines, operators, and routing probabilities derived from the event log.
  - Duration distributions: separate setup vs. processing; feed with parametric fits and empirically derived tail corrections.
  - Disruptions: integrate breakdown processes (frequency/duration) with repair patterns.
  - Demand profiles: simulate periods of high load, stable load, and unexpected hot jobs.
- Compare scenarios:
  - Baseline: local FCFS/EDD rules.
  - Strategy 1: DDS-DD-SET with learned setup penalties and dynamic weights.
  - Strategy 2: Predictive scheduling with risk-aware loading and probabilistic durations.
  - Strategy 3: Clustered sequencing with transition optimization at bottlenecks.
  - Hybrid: combine Strategy 3 on bottlenecks with Strategy 1 on non-bottlenecks and Strategy 2 for risk management.
- Key experiments:
  - High utilization periods (long queues at bottleneck, low slack).
  - Frequent short breakdowns at the bottleneck.
  - Multiple hot-job insertions during a shift.
  - Unusual mix spikes (e.g., a run of long-setup families).
  - Operator skill variability and optional cross-training availability.
- Evaluate with:
  - Weighted tardiness, on-time percentage by priority class, total setup time, utilization, and resource balance.
  - Simulation to gap tests: re-validate fitted distributions after one week of live deployment to ensure stability.

B. Deployment path
- Phased rollout:
  - Start with Strategy 3 on the most constrained bottleneck for four weeks; observe setup and tardiness changes.
  - Add Strategy 1 to the same bottleneck and two adjacent stations; measure downstream waiting and WIP.
  - Integrate Strategy 2 for the top 20% most revenue-critical jobs and certain customers.
- Feedback and calibration:
  - Retrain setup and duration models monthly with new data.
  - Adjust weights (, , , , , ) quarterly using a simple grid search or Bayesian optimization on live KPIs.

C. Continuous monitoring and adaptation
- Real-time dashboards:
  - WIP by work center, bottleneck utilization, queue times, setup time share, and tardiness risk by job priority.
  - KPI alarms with thresholds tied to service level commitments (e.g., alert when 7-day rolling weighted tardiness rises above a baseline).
- Conformance and drift detection:
  - Monitor model residuals for durations and setup predictions; drift beyond preset triggers triggers retraining.
  - Process variants monitor: detect when new routing patterns appear (new process flows or parts) and ensure scheduler’s capability set is updated.
- Automated sequence recommendations:
  - For each bottleneck queue, propose a short sequence (next 4–8 jobs) computed by Strategy 3 and share with the scheduler/operator interface.
- Closed-loop control:
  - If tardiness rises above a control limit for two consecutive days, temporarily increase the  weight (due-date urgency) in the dispatching score and push more jobs earlier through the bottleneck.
  - When breakdowns exceed expected frequency, tighten T horizons for predictive scheduling to avoid overloading the same machines.

---

Putting it all together
- What: Use process mining to reconstruct the actual flows, quantify the cost of poor sequencing and missed priorities, and measure disruption impacts.
- Why: The baseline dispatching policy ignores setup costs and downstream capacity, causing uneven utilization, high WIP, and chronic tardiness.
- How: Deploy a three-part solution—enhanced dynamic dispatching with learned setup penalties, predictive scheduling under uncertainty, and intelligent sequencing at bottlenecks—validated via discrete-event simulation and governed by a continuous mining-and-control loop.

Expected outcomes after 3–4 months
- 15–30% reduction in weighted tardiness on high-priority jobs.
- 10–25% reduction in total setup time at bottlenecks.
- 5–15% improvement in resource balance (lower variation in utilization across stations).
- Lower WIP variability and more reliable promised delivery dates.

By linking each decision to a mined insight and each insight to a measurable improvement, Precision Parts can move from reactive scheduling to a proactive, data-driven operation that protects due dates while making the best use of precious machine time.
