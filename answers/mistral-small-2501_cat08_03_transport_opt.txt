### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

#### Data Preprocessing and Integration

**Preprocessing Steps:**
1. **Data Cleaning:** Remove any duplicate or erroneous entries from the event logs. Ensure timestamps are consistent and correctly formatted.
2. **Data Normalization:** Standardize the format of location coordinates, vehicle IDs, driver IDs, and package IDs.
3. **Event Alignment:** Align events from different sources (GPS, scanner, dispatch, maintenance) based on timestamps and case IDs (Vehicle-Day). This ensures that each event is correctly associated with the corresponding vehicle and operational day.
4. **Event Enrichment:** Combine data from different sources to create a comprehensive event log. For example, enrich GPS data with scanner events to capture delivery milestones and maintenance logs to track vehicle status.

**Challenges:**
- **Data Synchronization:** Ensuring that timestamps from different sources are synchronized.
- **Data Completeness:** Handling missing or incomplete data, especially from handheld scanners.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensuring that the data from different sources is consistent and accurately reflects the actual events.

**Integration Example:**

**Process Discovery:**
- **Algorithm Selection:** Use algorithms like the Fuzzy Miner or Inductive Miner to discover the actual process model. These algorithms can handle noise and variability in the event data.
- **Visualization:** Create process maps that show the sequence of activities, including deviations and unplanned stops. Use color-coding and annotations to highlight key events like deliveries, delays, and maintenance stops.

**Conformance Checking:**
- **Comparison Metrics:** Compare the discovered process model against the planned routes from the dispatch system. Look for sequence deviations, unplanned stops, and significant timing differences.
- **Deviation Types:**
  - **Sequence Deviations:** Identify where the actual sequence of activities differs from the planned sequence.
  - **Unplanned Stops:** Detect stops that were not part of the planned route.
  - **Timing Differences:** Measure the difference between planned and actual times for each activity.

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
1. **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of deliveries completed within the customer-requested time window.
2. **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Average time spent at each delivery stop.
3. **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Ratio of travel time to service time (time spent at customer locations).
4. **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Fuel efficiency per kilometer traveled and per package delivered.
5. **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Percentage of time the vehicle is in use during the operational day.
6. **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:** Number and duration of traffic delays encountered.
7. **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Percentage of delivery attempts that result in failure.

**Calculation Examples:**
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** (Number of On-Time Deliveries / Total Deliveries) * 100
- **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Total Time Spent at Delivery Stops / Number of Delivery Stops

**Bottleneck Identification:**
- **Process Mining Techniques:** Use techniques like bottleneck analysis, which involves identifying activities with high waiting times or long durations.
- **Bottleneck Factors:** Analyze bottlenecks related to specific routes, times of day, drivers, vehicle types, traffic hotspots, or specific activities (e.g., finding parking, customer interaction time).
- **Quantification:** Use metrics like cycle time, throughput, and resource utilization to quantify the impact of bottlenecks.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

**Potential Root Causes:**
1. **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Static routes may not adapt to real-time conditions.
2. **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:** Poor estimation of travel times can lead to delays.
3. **Traffic Congestion Patterns:** High traffic areas can cause significant delays.
4. **High Variability in Service Time:** Inconsistent service times at customer locations.
5. **Vehicle Breakdowns:** Frequent breakdowns or maintenance needs.
6. **Driver Behavior:** Differences in driving skills and adherence to routes.
7. **Failed Delivery Attempts:** High rate of failed deliveries requiring re-delivery.

**Process Mining Analyses:**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare high-performing vs. low-performing routes/drivers to identify best practices.
- **Traffic Data Correlation:** Correlate traffic data with delays to understand the impact of congestion.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Analyze the time spent at customer locations to identify inefficiencies.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Schedules**
- **Inefficiency Targeted:** Frequent vehicle breakdowns.
- **Root Cause:** Lack of proactive maintenance.
- **Supporting Data:** Vehicle usage patterns and maintenance logs.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduced Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays and improved Fuel Consumption per km/package.

### 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

**Operational Constraints:**
- **Driver Working Hours:** Ensure that dynamic routing and optimized territories do not violate driver working hour regulations.
- **Vehicle Capacities:** Consider vehicle capacities when optimizing routes and territories.
- **Customer Time Windows:** Ensure that optimized routes and territories respect customer-requested delivery time windows.

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- **Process Mining Dashboards:** Implement dashboards to track key metrics and process views.
- **Key Metrics:** On-Time Delivery Rate, Average Time per Delivery Stop, Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio, Fuel Consumption per km/package, Vehicle Utilization Rate, Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays, Rate of Failed Deliveries.
- **Process Views:** Visualize the end-to-end delivery process, highlighting deviations, delays, and bottlenecks.
- **Emerging Issues:** Quickly identify and address any new emerging issues through continuous monitoring and analysis.

By following this comprehensive approach, Speedy Parcels can leverage process mining to gain valuable insights into their delivery operations, identify inefficiencies, and implement data-driven optimization strategies to improve delivery punctuality and reduce operational costs.
