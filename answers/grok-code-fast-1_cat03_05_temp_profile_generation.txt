First, the temporal profile is a dictionary with keys as tuples of activity pairs, and values as (avg_time, std_dev) in seconds.


## Defining Temporal Profile  
- The temporal profile is structured as a dictionary with keys as tuples representing pairs of activities.  
- Values in the dictionary are tuples containing the average time and standard deviation, measured in seconds.  

## Listing Activities  
- Key activities include Supplier Selection (SS), Order Placement (OP), and Receive (RC).  
- These activities form the pairs used as keys in the temporal profile dictionary.

## Expanding Activity List  
- New activities include Quality Inspection (QI), Component Assembly (CA), Product Testing (PT), Packaging (PK), Warehouse Storage (WS), Distribution (DT), and After-Sales Support (AS).  
- These activities expand the possible pairs in the temporal profile, covering more supply chain stages.  

## Generating Pairs  
- For a trace like <A,B,C,D>, all pairs such as (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), and (C,D) are considered, not just consecutive ones.  
- This approach ensures complexity by including pairs separated by multiple steps in the process.  

## Estimating Times  
- Need to estimate average times and standard deviations for these pairs, as no explicit numerical data is provided.  
- Estimates will be based on real-world supply chain knowledge, with times in seconds (e.g., 86400 s = 1 day, 3600 s = 1 hour).

These estimates are based on typical supply chain timelines for high-tech electronics, where early stages (e.g., procurement) involve longer, variable delays, while later stages (e.g., packaging) are quicker. Times are in seconds, with standard deviations reflecting variability from factors like supplier reliability, inspection thoroughness, and distribution logistics. The subset includes a mix of close pairs (e.g., ('RC', 'QI')) and distant pairs (e.g., ('SS', 'AS')) to demonstrate complexity, but it's not exhaustive of all possible pairs. All pairs represent activities that eventually follow each other in the process.
