We are going to use a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery to first count the number of events per case.
 Then, we will use that count to filter the original event_log, only keeping cases with count <= 6.
 We can do this by joining the event_log with the counts table (or using a subquery in the WHERE clause).

 Alternatively, we can use the `WITH` clause to create a temporary table for the counts and then filter.

 Let me write the query using a CTE for clarity.

 Step 1: Count the events per case_id.
 Step 2: Use that CTE to filter the event_log by only case_ids that have a count <= 6.

 However, note: We are to return the full set of events for the cases that have six or fewer events.

 We can also do this with a window function, but let's stick to a CTE for simplicity.

 Example using CTE:

 WITH case_counts AS (
   SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as event_count
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
 )
 SELECT el.*
 FROM event_log el
 INNER JOIN case_counts cc ON el.case_id = cc.case_id;

 But note: the above uses an INNER JOIN on the case_counts which only has cases with <=6 events.

 Alternatively, we can use a subquery in the WHERE clause:

 SELECT *
 FROM event_log
 WHERE case_id IN (
   SELECT case_id
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
 );

 Both methods are acceptable. The INNER JOIN might be more efficient if the event_log is large and we have a good number of cases to exclude, but DuckDB is optimized for both.

 Let me choose the INNER JOIN with CTE for clarity.

 However, note: the problem says "filter out any cases containing more than six events", so we are excluding those with >6, and keeping <=6.

 Let me adjust the HAVING condition in the CTE to be <=6.

 But wait, the problem says: "exclude any case_id where this count is greater than six", so we want cases with count <= 6.

 So the above CTE is correct.

 Let me write the final query.

Here’s a DuckDB SQL query that filters out cases with more than six events and returns all events for cases with six or fewer events:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN case_event_counts cec
    ON el.case_id = cec.case_id;
```

**Explanation:**
1. **CTE `case_event_counts`**: 
   - Groups events by `case_id` and calculates the total number of events per case.
   - Filters groups using `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to retain only cases with **six or fewer events**.
2. **Main Query**:
   - Performs an `INNER JOIN` between the original `event_log` and the filtered CTE.
   - Returns all event details (`el.*`) exclusively for cases that meet the criteria.

This ensures only events from cases with 6 events are included, efficiently excluding over-sized cases.
