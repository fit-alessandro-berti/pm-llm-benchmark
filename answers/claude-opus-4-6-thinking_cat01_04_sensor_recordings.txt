# Process Mining Analysis: Manufacturing Assembly Line

## Overview

After analyzing the sensor readings across all 15 events, I identified **six distinct phases** based on clear shifts in the numerical patterns. Below is the full breakdown.

## Labeled Activities

###  Phase 1 — **Idle / Standby** (Events 1–3)

| Sensor | Readings |
|---|---|
| Temperature | 20–21 °C (ambient) |
| Pressure | 1 bar (atmospheric baseline) |
| Vibration | 0 Hz |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s |
| Tool Position | 0 mm (home position) |
| Energy | 0.40–0.50 kWh (minimal draw) |

**Rationale:** Every sensor is at or near its baseline/resting value. The tool is at home position (0 mm), no material is flowing, no vibration is detected, and only minimal standby power is consumed. The machine is powered on but not actively performing work. This is a **startup or idle warm-up** phase.

###  Phase 2 — **Cutting Metal** (Events 4–6)

| Sensor | Readings |
|---|---|
| Temperature | 50  55  58 °C (rising) |
| Pressure | 1  1.5 bar (slight increase) |
| Vibration | 30  35  38 Hz (high, rising) |
| Material Flow | 5 units/s (steady, high) |
| Tool Position | 5  7  10 mm (advancing) |
| Energy | 2.00  2.50  3.00 kWh (ramping) |

**Rationale:** This phase shows the hallmark signatures of a **cutting operation**:
- **High and rising vibration** (30–38 Hz) — consistent with a blade or cutting tool engaging material, generating mechanical oscillations.
- **Elevated and climbing temperature** — frictional heat from cutting action.
- **Steady, high material flow** (5 units/s) — raw material is being fed continuously into the cut.
- **Progressively advancing tool position** (5  10 mm) — the cutting tool is moving through the workpiece.
- **Ramping energy consumption** — the motor is under increasing load.

The gradual escalation across all sensors is characteristic of a cutting tool progressively engaging deeper into a metal workpiece.

###  Phase 3 — **Assembling Parts** (Events 7–8)

| Sensor | Readings |
|---|---|
| Temperature | 40 °C (moderate, stable) |
| Pressure | 2 bar (elevated, steady) |
| Vibration | 10 Hz (low, stable) |
| Material Flow | 2 units/s (reduced, steady) |
| Tool Position | 15 mm (fixed) |
| Energy | 2.00 kWh (constant) |

**Rationale:** The dramatic shift to **stable, moderate conditions** across two consecutive readings signals a fundamentally different operation:
- **Increased pressure (2 bar) with low vibration** — suggests parts are being pressed or fitted together, not cut. The force is sustained rather than oscillatory.
- **Reduced but nonzero material flow** (2 units/s) — components (fasteners, sub-parts) are being fed at a controlled rate.
- **Fixed tool position** (15 mm) — the tool/fixture is holding steady, consistent with a clamping or alignment function rather than a traversing cut.
- **Stable energy at moderate level** — no high-power cutting or welding, just steady mechanical work.
- **Repeatability** (two identical readings) — assembly involves holding a position while joining, indicating a dwell time.

###  Phase 4 — **Welding** (Event 9)

| Sensor | Readings |
|---|---|
| Temperature | **80 °C** (highest in the log) |
| Pressure | 2 bar |
| Vibration | **50 Hz** (highest in the log) |
| Material Flow | **0 units/s** |
| Tool Position | 15 mm (unchanged) |
| Energy | **5.00 kWh** (highest in the log) |

**Rationale:** This single event is the most extreme reading in the entire log and strongly indicates **welding**:
- **Peak temperature (80 °C)** — welding generates the highest localized heat of any common manufacturing step, as materials are fused together.
- **Peak vibration (50 Hz)** — the arc or friction welding process creates intense, high-frequency vibrations.
- **Peak energy consumption (5.00 kWh)** — welding is extremely energy-intensive (electric arc, laser, or resistance heating).
- **Zero material flow** — no new material is being introduced; the already-assembled parts are being fused at their joint. The weld consumes the material already in place.
- **Unchanged tool position (15 mm)** — the welding head is operating on the same assembly from the previous phase.

The combination of simultaneous maxima in temperature, vibration, and energy with zero flow is a signature unique to welding.

###  Phase 5 — **Quality Inspection** (Event 10)

| Sensor | Readings |
|---|---|
| Temperature | 30 °C (cooling down) |
| Pressure | 1 bar (baseline) |
| Vibration | 1 Hz (near-zero) |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s |
| Tool Position | 15 mm (unchanged) |
| Energy | 1.00 kWh (low) |

**Rationale:** This event represents a **cool-down and measurement** step:
- **Dramatic drop in temperature, vibration, and energy** — no active manufacturing is occurring. The workpiece is being allowed to rest.
- **Negligible vibration (1 Hz)** — may correspond to a light sensor probe or measurement device taking readings, not a machining tool.
- **No material flow** — nothing is being added or removed.
- **Tool position remains at 15 mm** — the workpiece hasn't moved from the assembly/welding station, suggesting it's being inspected *in situ*.
- **Low but nonzero energy** — consistent with powering sensors, cameras, or gauges for dimensional/structural inspection.

This transitional, low-activity event between the high-energy welding and the final packaging strongly suggests a **quality checkpoint**.

###  Phase 6 — **Packaging** (Events 11–12)

| Sensor | Readings |
|---|---|
| Temperature | 25 °C (near-ambient) |
| Pressure | 1 bar |
| Vibration | 5 Hz (very low) |
| Material Flow | 1 unit/s (minimal) |
| Tool Position | **20 mm** (final, furthest position) |
| Energy | 1.50–1.60 kWh (low-moderate) |

**Rationale:** This final active phase indicates **packaging or finished-goods handling**:
- **Near-ambient temperature** — no thermal process is occurring.
- **Small material flow (1 unit/s)** — consistent with packaging material (wrapping, boxing, labeling) being applied, not raw production material.
- **Tool position at its maximum (20 mm)** — the workpiece has advanced to the final station in the process, furthest from the starting point.
- **Low vibration (5 Hz)** — light mechanical activity such as wrapping, sealing, or conveyor movement.
- **Modest energy** — consistent with running packaging equipment (conveyors, sealers) rather than heavy machining.

###  Phase 7 — **Idle / Standby (Cycle Reset)** (Events 13–15)

| Sensor | Readings |
|---|---|
| All sensors | Return to the exact same baseline as Events 1–3 |
| Tool Position | **0 mm** (returned to home) |

**Rationale:** All readings mirror the initial idle state. The tool has returned to home position (0 mm), confirming the **manufacturing cycle is complete** and the machine is ready for the next workpiece.
