Based on the provided object-centric event log, the following process and data-specific issues can be identified as root causes for performance issues:

1. **Inefficient resource allocation and utilization**: The Forklift object type has many self-loops and long durations, indicating that forklifts might be waiting or being underutilized. For example, "Place in Stock" has a self-loop with a long duration, suggesting that forklifts might be waiting for available storage space. Additionally, the high frequency of "Load to Vehicle" and "Bring to Loading Bay" events for Forklift objects indicates potential bottlenecks in these activities.

2. **Delays in container handling**: The Container object type has several activities with long durations, such as "Order Empty Containers" to "Pick Up Empty Container" (average duration of 368943.92), "Place in Stock" to "Bring to Loading Bay" (average duration of 743380.51), and "Reschedule Container" events. These long durations suggest inefficiencies in container management, ordering, and rescheduling processes.

3. **Delays in vehicle booking and loading**: The Vehicle object type has long durations for "Book Vehicles" events, indicating potential inefficiencies in the vehicle booking process. Additionally, the high frequency of "Load to Vehicle" events and their long durations suggest potential bottlenecks in the loading process.

4. **Performance issues in the transportation process**: The Transport Document object type has long durations for "Create Transport Document" to "Book Vehicles" and "Book Vehicles" to "Order Empty Containers" events. Furthermore, the high frequency of "Depart" self-loops and "Reschedule Container" events indicate potential issues in the transportation process, such as delays, rescheduling, or cancellations.

5. **Limited visibility into Handling Unit and Truck object types**: The Handling Unit object type has only one activity, "Collect Goods" to "Load Truck," making it difficult to identify specific performance issues. Similarly, the Truck object type has a high frequency of "Load Truck" self-loops, which might indicate potential inefficiencies in the loading process or a lack of data to analyze the transportation process further.

To address these issues, consider the following recommendations:

- Optimize resource allocation and utilization for forklifts, ensuring they are used efficiently and not waiting for extended periods.
- Improve container management, ordering, and rescheduling processes to reduce delays and inefficiencies.
- Streamline the vehicle booking and
