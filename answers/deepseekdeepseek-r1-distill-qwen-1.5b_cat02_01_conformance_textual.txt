Okay, so I need to figure out which cases in the event log violate the normative process described. Let me start by carefully reading the problem statement to understand the rules.

From the description, the process starts with "Receive order" and must check inventory before doing anything else. If there's not enough inventory, the process branches into "Cancel order" and then "Close order." If there's enough, the order should go through "Authorize payment," then "Package items," then "Ship order," and end with "Close order."

Now, looking at the event log, there are five cases, all with the same timestamp, but different activities. I'll go through each case by case.

Case 1: It starts with Receive order, then Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, and Close order. This matches the normative process, so no violation here.

Case 2: Same sequence as Case 1. It's also following the norm, so no issues.

Case 3: Here's where I see discrepancies. The activities are: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, then Ship order and Close order. Wait, after Authorize payment, it cancels instead of proceeding to Package items. According to the norm, after authorizing payment, the next step should be Package items, not Cancel. So this case violates the norm because it cancels before Package items are done.

Case 4: Receive order, then Check inventory, then Cancel order. But according to the norm, after Check inventory, it should proceed to Package items, not Cancel. So this also violates the norm. The process should have continued with Package items after Authorize payment.

Case 5: Similar to Cases 3 and 4. It starts with Receive, Check, Authorize, then Ship, and Close. But after Authorize, it should go to Package. Instead, it cancels order, which is incorrect. So this case also violates the norm.

Wait, but in Cases 4 and 5, the activity after Check is Cancel. According to the norm, after Check, you should go to Authorize, then Package, then Ship, then Close. So Cases 4 and 5 are incorrect because they skip Authorize and go directly to Cancel.

So I think Cases 4 and 5 are the ones that violate the norm because they skip Authorize payment and go directly to Cancel. But wait, in the description, if there's not enough inventory, the process must branch into Cancel order. So after Check, the order should proceed to Authorize payment, then Package, etc. So Cases 4 and 5, which go from Check to Cancel, are wrong.

But wait, in Case 3, after Authorize, it cancels instead of Package. That's also wrong because after Authorize, you should go to Package, not Cancel. So Cases 3, 4, and 5 all have violations because they skip Authorize and go to Cancel.

Let me summarize:

- Cases 4 and 5: After Check, instead of Authorize, they go to Cancel. So they're wrong because the norm says you should go to Authorize before Package.
- Case 3: After Authorize, instead of Package, they cancel. So that's also wrong because the norm says Package should come after Authorize.

So all three cases (3, 4, 5) violate the norm, whereas Cases 1 and 2 follow the norm correctly.

I need to explain this by referencing the normative description and the conditions it implies, interpreting ambiguities as best as possible. So each violation is due to either skipping Authorize after Check, or skipping Package after Authorize.

**Violation Analysis:**

The event log contains five cases, and only Cases 4 and 5 violate the normative process. The others follow correctly.

1. **Case 1:**
   - **Actions:** Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close.
   - **Issue:** Follows the norm.

2. **Case 2:**
   - **Actions:** Same as Case 1.
   - **Issue:** Fully follows the norm.

3. **Case 3:**
   - **Actions:** Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close.
   - **Issue:** After Authorize, cancels instead of Package. **Violation:** Skipping Package after Authorize.

4. **Case 4:**
   - **Actions:** Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close.
   - **Issue:** After Authorize, cancels. **Violation:** Skipping Package after Authorize.

5. **Case 5:**
   - **Actions:** Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close.
   - **Issue:** Same as Cases 3 and 4. **Violation:** Skipping Package after Authorize.

**Explanation:**
- **Violations:** Cases 3, 4, and 5 violate the norm by skipping "Authorize payment" after "Check inventory" and "Package items" after "Authorize payment," respectively. The correct sequence requires Authorize before Package, and Package before Ship.
- **Normative Compliance:** Only Cases 1 and 2 adhere to the described process without any deviations.
