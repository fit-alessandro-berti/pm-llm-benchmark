The diagram is a swimlane style process map (very much like a BPMN chart) showing how a computerhardware shop “dispatches goods.”  It’s divided into two lanes (or “roles”):  
 – Secretary (under a higher “Logistics” heading)  
 – Warehouse  

At a high level the flow is:

1. **Start Event (“Ship goods”)**  
   A circle in the Secretary lane kicks things off.  

2. **Parallel Split**  
   A splitter (a “parallel” gateway) immediately forks the work into two simultaneous streams:  
   A. The **Secretary’s stream**, which determines the shipment method, insurance and carrier.  
   B. The **Warehouse’s stream**, which physically packages the items.

A. Secretary’s stream (top lane)

3. **Clarify shipment method**  
   A task box. The outcome drives a decision: “Special handling?”  

4. **Branch: Special handling?**  
   – **Yes**  “Get 3 offers from logistic companies”  “Select logistic company and place order.”  
   – **No**   “Check if insurance is required” (the decision may use stored customer info, shown as a data store).

5. **Insurance check**  
   A decision gateway “If insurance necessary.”  
   – If “yes,” the flow goes off to an “Insure parcel” task, then returns.  
   – Either way (i.e. after insuring or if insurance wasn’t needed) it proceeds to “Write package label.”

6. **Rejoin**  
   After selecting a carrier (in the specialhandling branch) or writing the label (in the standard branch), the two paths converge at a merging gateway.

B. Warehouse’s stream (bottom lane)

3. **Package goods**  
   A task box in the Warehouse lane.  
   It has an attached timer boundary event marked “48 hours.”  
   – If packaging takes longer than 48 hours, a sidebranch “Notify customer about delay” is triggered.  
   – Either way, once packaging is done the flow returns to the merge point.

7. **Synchronization**  
   A parallel join gateway waits for both:  
   – the Secretary’s labeling/carrier stream  
   – the Warehouse’s packaging stream  

8. **Final steps**  
   Once both are complete:  
   – “Fill out shipment paperwork”  
   – “Move package to pickup area”  

9. **End Event (“Shipment prepared”)**  
   A circle marks the process completion.  

In summary, the chart lays out in two lanes how the secretary and the warehouse work in parallel—branching for special handling vs. standard shipments, deciding on insurance, obtaining quotes, packaging within a 48hour target, notifying the customer of delays, and finally converging to finish the paperwork and place the parcel in the pickup area.
