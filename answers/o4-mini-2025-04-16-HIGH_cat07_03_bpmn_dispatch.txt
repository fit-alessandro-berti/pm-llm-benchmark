The diagram is a BPMNstyle swimlane process for “Dispatch of goods” in a computer hardware shop, broken into two main lanes—Logistics (with a “Secretary” sublane) and Warehouse—showing how an order moves from the moment someone requests shipment to the moment the parcel is ready for pickup.

1. Start Event  
   • “Ship goods” triggers the entire process.  

2. Parallel Split (ANDgateway)  
   • From the start, two things happen in parallel:  
     – Logistics work in the Secretary lane  
     – Warehouse begins packaging  

3. Logistics / Secretary Lane  
   a) Clarify shipment method.  
   b) Exclusive Decision: “Special handling?”  
      – If YES:  
         • Get three offers from different logistics companies  
         • Select one company and place the order  
      – If NO:  
         • Go straight to “Check if insurance is required”  
   c) “Check if insurance is required” (consulting customer info)  
      • Exclusive Decision: “If insurance necessary”  
         – If YES: “Insure parcel”  
         – If NO: skip straight to “Write package label”  
   d) “Write package label”  
   e) Merge the “insure” path and the “label” path (parallel join)  
   f) Join with the output of the specialhandling branch (exclusive join)  

4. Warehouse Lane  
   a) “Package goods”  
   b) Timer Event attached to “Package goods”: if it takes longer than 48 hours, “Notify customer about delay.”  
   c) Once the goods are packaged (and any delay notification sent), this branch reaches an inclusive join gateway.  

5. Synchronization  
   • The two main streams (Logistics after label/ordering/insurance and Warehouse after packaging) meet at an inclusivegateway merge.  

6. Final Steps (crosslane)  
   a) “Fill out shipment paperwork”  
   b) “Move package to pickup area”  
   c) End Event: “Shipment prepared”  

Gateways used:  
• ANDsplit and ANDjoin for parallelization of Logistics vs. Warehouse work  
• XOR (exclusive) gateways for decisions on special handling and insurance  
• OR (inclusive) gateway to merge the packaging and Logistics paths once both are done  

In summary, the visualization shows a coordinated, partially parallel process where the secretary handles quotes, labeling, and insurance, the warehouse packages (with a timer for delays), and finally paperwork is completed so the shipment is ready.
