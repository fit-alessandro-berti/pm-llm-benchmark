 Event abstraction refers to the process of grouping low-level events or tasks into higher-level, more meaningful events to simplify complex process models derived from event logs. This technique can significantly improve the readability and manageability of such models. Here are some ways to effectively utilize event abstraction:

1. Grouping events based on business processes: Events can be grouped based on their role in business processes, such as "order processing," "invoice generation," or "payment confirmation." By abstracting events in this way, you can create a more understandable and concise model that closely aligns with the organization's business processes.

2. Aggregating similar events: If your process model contains many similar events or tasks, you can abstract them into a single event representing all of them. For example, multiple "item addition" events can be abstracted to a "complete order preparation" event. This can help reduce the complexity of the model, making it easier to comprehend and maintain.

3. Creating hierarchical abstraction: In this approach, events are abstracted based on their position within the process hierarchy. For instance, a series of related events could be abstracted into a single parent event, making the model more manageable and readable. By creating sub-events or sub-processes within events, you can maintain the level of detail necessary for analysis while making the overall model more understandable.

4. Eliminating unnecessary details: Event abstraction allows you to remove unnecessary or redundant events from the process model that may be hindering its readability. By focusing on the most important and relevant events, you can create a more streamlined and understandable model.

5. Leveraging domain knowledge: Utilize domain experts' knowledge to understand relationships and dependencies among events, enabling appropriate grouping and abstraction. This domain-driven approach ensures that your abstracted process model accurately reflects the business process, making it more manageable and useful for decision-making.
