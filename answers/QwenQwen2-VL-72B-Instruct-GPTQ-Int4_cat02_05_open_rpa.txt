Process mining is a data-driven approach to analyzing and understanding business processes. It involves collecting data from various sources, such as IT systems and logs, and using specialized software to analyze and visualize the data to gain insights into the processes. In the context of RPA, process mining can be used to identify and optimize the processes that are candidates for automation. This can help to enhance RPA initiatives by providing a better understanding of the processes, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring that the automation is implemented efficiently and effectively. Additionally, process mining can be used to monitor and evaluate the performance of the automated processes, ensuring that they are meeting the desired outcomes and are sustainable over time.
