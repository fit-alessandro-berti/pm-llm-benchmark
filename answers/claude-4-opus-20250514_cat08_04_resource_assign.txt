# Process Mining-Based Resource Assignment Optimization for TechSolve Solutions

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### 1.1 Resource Performance Metrics and Analysis

To comprehensively analyze agent and tier performance, I would extract and calculate the following key metrics from the event log:

**Individual Agent Metrics:**
- **Average Handle Time (AHT)** per ticket priority and category
- **First Contact Resolution (FCR) rate** for L1 agents
- **Ticket volume** handled per agent per time period
- **Skill utilization rate** (% of tickets matching agent's documented skills)
- **Reassignment rate** (tickets reassigned from/to each agent)
- **Idle time** between ticket completions and new assignments

**Tier-Level Metrics:**
- **Tier resolution rate** (% of tickets resolved without escalation)
- **Average queue time** per tier
- **Skill coverage** (% of required skills available in each tier)
- **Cross-tier handover frequency** and patterns
- **SLA compliance rate** by tier and priority level

### 1.2 Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Discovery

**Resource Interaction Analysis:**
Using process mining tools, I would create:
- **Handover matrices** showing ticket flow between agents
- **Social network graphs** revealing collaboration patterns and bottlenecks
- **Resource-activity matrices** showing which agents handle which activity types most frequently

**Role Discovery:**
Apply clustering algorithms on agent behavior patterns to identify:
- De facto roles vs. documented tier assignments
- Specialists who consistently handle specific ticket types
- Generalists who handle diverse ticket categories

**Variant Analysis for Assignment Paths:**
- Map the most common assignment sequences (e.g., L1L2L3 vs. L1L2ReassignL2)
- Identify deviations from expected escalation paths
- Calculate the frequency and impact of each variant

### 1.3 Skill Utilization Analysis

**Skill-Match Analysis:**
- Calculate the percentage of tickets where assigned agent possesses the required skill
- Identify "skill waste" where highly specialized agents handle basic tasks
- Map skill gaps where required skills are frequently unavailable

**Skill Demand vs. Supply:**
- Create heat maps showing peak demand times for specific skills
- Analyze skill bottlenecks causing delays or reassignments
- Identify underutilized skills in the agent pool

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### 2.1 Specific Resource Problems

**Skill-Based Bottlenecks:**
From the sample data, I can already identify patterns like:
- Network/Firewall skills appear to be a bottleneck (P2 ticket INC-1002 escalated despite being high priority)
- Database skills mismatch causing reassignment (INC-1001 reassigned from B12 to B15)

**Quantified Impact Analysis:**
- **Reassignment delay**: Calculate average time lost per reassignment (e.g., INC-1001 shows ~70 minutes delay due to reassignment)
- **Queue impact**: Measure correlation between queue length and SLA breaches
- **Skill mismatch cost**: Calculate % of tickets requiring reassignment due to skill issues

**Performance Disparities:**
- Identify agents with significantly higher/lower AHT than peer average
- Map workload imbalances (some agents handling 2x average volume)
- Correlate individual performance with SLA compliance

### 2.2 Resource Utilization Patterns

**Overutilization Indicators:**
- Agents with >85% utilization rates
- Increasing AHT trends indicating fatigue
- High reassignment rates from specific agents

**Underutilization Patterns:**
- L3 specialists handling L1-appropriate tickets
- Agents with <50% utilization while queues build
- Skills available but not being leveraged

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Assignment Rule Deficiencies

**Current State Issues:**
- Round-robin assignment ignores skill requirements
- No consideration of current agent workload
- Static tier boundaries despite varying ticket complexity

**Evidence from Process Mining:**
- High reassignment rates (estimated 15-20% based on sample)
- L1 escalation rate exceeding industry benchmarks
- Skill mismatches in initial assignments

### 3.2 Data Quality and Classification Issues

**Ticket Categorization Problems:**
- Analyze correlation between initial category and final resolution category
- Identify patterns where required skills change during ticket lifecycle
- Map frequency of skill requirement updates post-assignment

**Agent Profile Accuracy:**
- Compare documented skills vs. actual ticket resolution patterns
- Identify hidden skills (agents successfully resolving tickets outside documented expertise)
- Find skill gaps in documentation

### 3.3 Process and System Limitations

**Visibility Gaps:**
- Lack of real-time workload visibility leading to poor assignment decisions
- No predictive capability for skill requirements
- Manual escalation decisions introducing bias and delays

**Decision Mining Insights:**
- Analyze decision points where assignments go wrong
- Compare successful vs. unsuccessful assignment criteria
- Identify patterns in dispatcher decision-making

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### 4.1 Strategy 1: Multi-Factor Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting

**Issue Addressed:** Skill mismatches causing reassignments and delays

**Implementation Details:**
- Create skill proficiency matrix (Basic/Intermediate/Expert) for each agent
