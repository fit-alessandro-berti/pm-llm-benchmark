 Based on the provided sequences and their associated metrics, the main differences can be observed in the following aspects:

1. **Screening Process**:
   - Some paths include an "Extensive Screening" step while others do not. This difference likely affects both the frequency (number of instances) and performance.
   - Paths with extensive screening tend to have lower frequencies but higher performance, suggesting that this extra step may help filter out less ideal tenants, reducing cancellations.

2. **Number of Rent Payments Before Cancellation**:
   - The number of "Pay Rent" steps varies significantly between paths. Some paths show tenants cancelling after only a few rent payments, while others indicate tenants staying much longer before cancelling.
   - Generally, the more "Pay Rent" steps in a sequence, the higher the performance score. This suggests that retaining tenants for a longer period positively impacts overall performance.

3. **Frequency and Performance**:
   - Higher frequencies of cancellations (e.g., paths with lower numbers of "Pay Rent") correlate with lower performance scores. This indicates that frequent tenant turnover is less desirable.
   - Paths with higher frequencies of moves without cancellations tend to have higher performance scores, reflecting the stability and financial benefits of long-term tenancies.

4. **Tenant Cancellation Reason**:
   - Although the reason for cancellation is not specified in the sequences, the variations in frequency and performance indicate differences in tenant satisfaction or suitability. Paths that include extensive screening might result in more satisfied tenants who stay longer, thus improving performance.

5. **Path Length**:
   - Some paths are significantly longer due to multiple "Pay Rent" steps before cancellation, while others are shorter. The longer paths typically have higher performance scores, highlighting the importance of retaining tenants over extended periods.

### Example Analysis:
- **Comparison 1**:
  - Without Extensive Screening (Path 3): Frequency = 103, Performance = 960002.670
  - With Extensive Screening (Path 4): Frequency = 84, Performance = 1040011.655
  - Both paths have similar lengths, but the one with extensive screening has a higher performance score despite a lower frequency.

- **Comparison 2**:
  - Paths 7 and 9 show similar steps except for the number of "Pay Rent" actions before cancellation:
    - Path 7 (Frequency = 56, Performance = 1200034.536) includes eight "Pay Rent" actions.
    - Path 9 (Frequency = 45, Performance = 1280091.444) includes nine "Pay Rent" actions.
  - Both have high performance scores, but more "Pay Rent" steps lead to a slightly higher performance score in this case.

### Conclusion:
- **Extensive Screening** helps filter tenants and improves the likelihood of long-term tenancies.
- A higher number of "Pay Rent" steps (longer tenancy) significantly increases performance.
- Frequent cancellations reduce overall performance, emphasizing the importance of tenant retention strategies.
