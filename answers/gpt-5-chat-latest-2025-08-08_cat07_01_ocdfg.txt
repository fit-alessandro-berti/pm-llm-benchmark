This visualization illustrates a **process flow diagram**, representing multiple interconnected workflows. It shows how various activities are linked, the order in which they occur, and the time taken between steps. The diagram uses boxes to represent activities, arrows for sequence flows, and connector labels for timing.

Here’s a breakdown of the diagram:

---

### **Top Entities (Processes Start Points)**
There are five high-level starting objects, each representing a process entry point along with the number of objects handled:
- **VendorInvoiceItem** (1.2M objects) – enters at the left side.  
- **ReturnOrderItem** (0.8M objects) – starts in the middle-left.  
- **PurchaseRequisitionItem** (2.0M objects) – located middle-top.  
- **SalesOrderItem** (3.5M objects) – near the middle-right.  
- **PurchaseOrderItem** (5.0M objects) – far right-top.

From these start points, workflows begin and connect to different parts of the process.

### **Process Stages**
Each stage is represented by a rectangular box (sometimes with colored dots or outlines to denote different categories or process types). Each box contains:
- **Activity name**  
- **Overall volume** processed ("Overall: X.XM" objects).

Here are key activities and some of their metrics:
- **Create Requisition** – 3.0M total, preceded by PurchaseRequisitionItem start, leads to *Approve Requisition*.
- **Approve Requisition** – 5.7M total, central in the diagram, sends flows to *Send Order*, *Check Stock*, *Process Return*, and other steps.
- **Create Order** – 8.5M total, triggered from SalesOrderItem and PurchaseOrderItem paths, leading to *Pack Goods*.
- **Send Order** – 5.2M total, last step in a chain from *Approve Requisition* before ending.
- **Check Stock** – 1.0M total, then flows to *Approve Payment*.
- **Approve Payment** – 1.5M total, leading into *Create Invoice*.
- **Create Invoice** – 2.0M total, ends process.
- **Process Return** – 0.8M total, connected with *Approve Payment* and sometimes loops back from *Confirm Delivery*.
- **Pack Goods**  **Ship Goods**  **Confirm Delivery**  **Close Order** – represents the shipping and fulfillment chain.

### **Flow Details**
- Lines and arrows indicate process transitions.
- Times on the lines represent **average elapsed time** between activities (e.g., "400ms", "650ms").
- Multiple colored lines (green, purple, blue, red, etc.) represent different process or data flow categories.
- Flows can branch or merge — e.g., *Approve Requisition* splits into several different follow-up activities.
- There are feedback loops — for example, *Confirm Delivery* can branch to *Process Return*.
- Endpoints are represented by small oval shapes labeled "End".

### **Overall Process Patterns**
- **Requisition and Ordering** processes dominate the center and left of the diagram.
- **Sales fulfillment** (Create Order  Ship Goods chain) is on the right.
- **Returns** connect back from later stages in the sales process to handle reverse logistics.
- **Financial processes** (*Approve Payment*, *Create Invoice*) follow from ordering and return processing steps.

If you’d like, I can create a **simplified summary diagram** that separates **Procurement**, **Sales Fulfillment**, and **Returns & Invoicing** processes so that the flow is clearer at a glance. Would you like me to do that?
