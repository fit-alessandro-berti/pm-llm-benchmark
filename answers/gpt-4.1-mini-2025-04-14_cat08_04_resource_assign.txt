## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### 1.1. Using Event Log Data to Analyze Agent and Tier Performance
Process mining can leverage the detailed event log containing ticket lifecycle data, agent attributes, and ticket metadata to extract insights about resource behavior and assignment patterns:

- **Workload Distribution:**
  - Calculate the number of tickets handled per agent and per tier (L1, L2, L3) over time.
  - Measure concurrent workload by analyzing overlapping active activities (e.g., `Work Lx Start` to `Work Lx End`).
  - Identify load imbalance: which agents are over- or under-utilized.

- **Activity Processing Times:**
  - Compute average handling times per agent and per tier for activities like “Work L1 Start” to “Work L1 End”, “Work L2 Start” to “Work L2 End,” etc.
  - Breakdown processing times by ticket priority and category to expose complexity-related delays.

- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1:**
  - Calculate the proportion of tickets resolved at L1 without escalation.
  - Analyze FCR by ticket categories, required skills, and L1 agent skills.

- **Frequency of Handling Specific Ticket Types and Skills:**
  - Aggregate how often each agent or tier deals with tickets requiring specific technical skills (e.g., ‘App-CRM’, ‘Networking-Firewall’).
  - Cross-reference with agent skill profiles to verify assignments.

### 1.2. Using Process Mining Techniques to Reveal Assignment Patterns

- **Resource Interaction and Handovers:**
  - Apply *handover-of-work* analysis to map ticket transitions between agents or tiers.
  - Identify common escalation paths (e.g., L1  L2  L3 or L1  L2  L2 reassignment).
  - Detect frequent reassignment loops or backflows.

- **Social Network Analysis (SNA):**
  - Create a graph where nodes represent agents (or teams), edges represent ticket handovers.
  - Analyze the network for:
    - Central agents or teams acting as bottlenecks or hubs.
    - Dense clusters indicating possible resource silos.
    - Unexpected interactions that diverge from official escalation paths.

- **Role Discovery / Clustering:**
  - Use unsupervised learning on event attributes (e.g., activities, skills used) to identify actual emergent roles or agent specializations.
  - Compare discovered roles with official tiers and skill profiles to detect misalignment.

- **Comparing Actual vs. Intended Assignment Logic:**
  - Extract assignment heuristics from dispatch logs and documented rules (e.g., round-robin, skill match).
  - Contrast with actual assignments observed; e.g., track frequency of assignments ignoring skill matches.
  - Quantify the deviation from intended policies, such as percentage of assignments outside the preferred skill sets or imbalance in workload.

### 1.3. Analyzing Skill Utilization Across Agent Pool

- **Skill Matching Analysis:**
  - For each ticket, verify if assigned agent(s) possess required skills.
  - Calculate the rate of skill mismatches or partial matches.

- **Specialist vs. Generalist Workload:**
  - Identify L2/L3 specialists (e.g., database experts) and measure time spent on tickets requiring their specialized skills vs. tickets solvable by L1 or with more generic skill sets.
  - Detect cases where specialists handle low-skill tickets, indicating possible misassignment or inefficient escalation.

- **Skill Availability vs. Demand:**
  - Map frequency of tickets requiring rare or high-demand skills against available agents with those skills.
  - Highlight scarcity bottlenecks or overdependence on certain agents.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### 2.1. Pinpointing Specific Problems

- **Insufficient Skilled Agent Availability:**
  - Identify queues or waiting times at assignment or work start that correlate with tickets requiring rare skills.
  - Detect excessive delays before assignment to qualified agents or escalations.

- **Delays Due to Reassignments/Escalations:**
  - Quantify average delay introduced per reassignment event (e.g., time from `Reassign` or `Escalate` activity to "Work Start" by next agent).
  - Calculate the number and percentage of tickets with multiple reassignments.
  - Identify tickets with reassignment loops or oscillations.

- **Impact of Incorrect Initial Assignments:**
  - Analyze tickets where initial L1 assignment resulted in quick escalation or reassignment.
  - Correlate initial assignment skill mismatches with escalations and overall resolution delay.

- **Underperforming or Overloaded Agents or Teams:**
  - Pinpoint agents with longer-than-average processing times or higher-than-average number of escalations per ticket.
  - Detect consistently overloaded agents by ticket volume and active task concurrency.

- **Correlation with SLA Breaches:**
  - Overlay SLA breach events (e.g., time to resolution exceeding thresholds for P2/P3 tickets) with resource-related events.
  - Calculate proportion of SLA breaches preceded by skill mismatch, reassignment, or assignment delay.

### 2.2. Quantifying Impacts

| Issue                           | Quantification Example                                           |
| -------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Avg. delay per reassignment    | e.g., 30 min average added per reassignment event              |
| % SLA breaches linked to skill mismatch | e.g., 40% of P2 SLA breaches follow initial skill mismatch  |
| Load imbalance                 | e.g., top 10% agents handle 60% of high-priority tickets        |
| Reassignment frequency          | e.g., 25% of tickets require 2 reassignments                  |
| Specialist misutilization      | e.g., specialists spend 20% of work time on low-skill tickets   |

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### 3.1. Potential Root Causes

- **Assignment Rule Deficiency:**
  - Round-robin logic ignores skill requirements or current workload => poor skill-to-ticket matching, some agents overloaded.

- **Incomplete or Inaccurate Skill Profiles:**
  - Agents’ documented skills may not reflect actual proficiency or current certification, leading to misassignments.

- **Poor Ticket Categorization:**
  - Frontline triage imperfect; tickets may be categorized inaccurately, causing incorrect skill or tier routing.

- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
  - Dispatchers/operators lack up-to-date agent workload and availability information; leads to suboptimal manual decisions.

- **Insufficient L1 Training or Empowerment:**
  - L1 agents escalate prematurely due to lack of expertise or confidence, increasing workload on L2/L3.

### 3.2. Leveraging Variant and Decision Mining for Diagnosis

- **Variant Analysis:**
  - Compare ticket variants with:
    - Smooth flow: resolved at L1 or minimal escalations, no reassignment.
    - Problematic flow: multiple escalations, reassignments, SLA breach.
  - Identify patterns in ticket attributes, agent skills, timestamps leading to problematic variants.

- **Decision Mining:**
  - Use decision mining to discover decision rules behind assignments:
    - E.g., map ticket attributes and resource state (skill, workload) to assignment decisions.
  - Identify implicit or inconsistent decision points causing inefficiencies.

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### 4.1. Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting

- **Addresses:** Skill mismatch problems, inappropriate escalations, inefficient specialist usage.
- **Description:** Assign tickets primarily to agents whose documented skills match or exceed the ticket's required skills, weighting more experienced or proficient agents higher in assignment priority.
- **Insights Leveraged:** From skill utilization and skill mismatch analysis showing frequent assignments ignoring skill fit.
- **Data Required:** Agent skill profiles including proficiency levels, ticket skill requirements, historic resolution success rates by skill.
- **Expected Benefits:** Higher first-contact resolution rates, fewer escalations, better specialist utilization.

### 4.2. Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Dynamic Assignment

- **Addresses:** Load imbalance and bottlenecks caused by overloading some agents and idle time in others.
- **Description:** Incorporate real-time workload and availability metrics into assignment logic (e.g., number of active tickets, mean handling times, current queue length).
- **Insights Leveraged:** From workload distribution and agent utilization analysis showing uneven workloads.
- **Data Required:** Real-time and historic agent workload data, queue metrics.
- **Expected Benefits:** Even workload distribution, reduced wait times, improved SLA compliance.

### 4.3. Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Using Ticket Features

- **Addresses:** Poor initial categorization and escalation delays.
- **Description:** Use machine learning models trained on historical tickets (categories, descriptions, channels, priorities) to predict required skills and complexity upfront; auto-assign tickets or assist dispatchers appropriately.
- **Insights Leveraged:** Variant analysis and decision mining uncovering frequent miscategorization and skill prediction errors.
- **Data Required:** Historical ticket data, text analytics on description, labeled skill requirements.
- **Expected Benefits:** More accurate first assignments, reduced reassignment rates, fewer escalations, higher first-call resolution.

**Additional Optional Strategies:**
- Refined escalation criteria based on success patterns.
- Dynamic scalar adjustment of L1/L2 workforce based on temporal demand fluctuations.
- Empowerment and training programs linked to observed bottlenecks.

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### 5.1. Using Business Process Simulation

- **Develop simulation models** mirroring ticket flows, resource tiers, skill distributions, and current assignment rules.
- **Parameterize simulations** with timing distributions, workloads, and process variants mined from event logs.
- **Simulate “what-if” scenarios** applying proposed assignment strategies separately and in combination.
- Measure simulated KPIs: average resolution times, escalations, queue lengths, SLA breach rates.
- **Use simulation outcomes** to prioritize strategies and fine-tune parameters prior to live deployment.

### 5.2. Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan

- **Set up process mining dashboards** tracking key resource-related KPIs in near real-time:
  - Average handling and waiting times per agent/tier.
  - Reassignment and escalation frequency.
  - First-call resolution rates.
  - Skill match rates for assignments.
  - Workload balance indicators (e.g., ticket count per agent).
  - SLA compliance per ticket priority.
- **Monitor Social Network graphs** regularly to detect emergence of new bottlenecks or unexpected handover patterns.
- **Perform continuous variant and conformance checking** comparing actual flow to ideal improved model.
- **Feedback loop:**
  - Use monitoring data to adapt assignment rules and reprioritize agent training.
  - Detect degradation or new patterns early.
