To create the comprehensive event log as specified, we will first map out each activity based on the data provided. We'll use `order_id` as our case identifier and derive events from different tables such as "Order Created," "Items Picked," "Dispatched," "Arrived," "Invoice Issued," and "Payment Received." Each event will be placed in chronological order, and weâ€™ll enrich with resources where available.

Here is the structured table for the final event log:

| Case ID | Activity Name        | Timestamp                | Resource/Actor    | Additional Attributes |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|

### Assumptions:
- For each order, we create a "Order Created" event using the `order_date`.
- Each picked item is represented by an "Item Picked" event.
- A single dispatch/arrival pair from the Delivery table results in two events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived."
- The creation of an invoice results in an "Invoice Issued" event, with each payment linked to a respective "Payment Received" event.

This structure allows us to maintain chronological order while providing a clear traceability through the entire lifecycle of each order.
