### **Analysis of Cases**

---

### **1. Identifying Normative Rule Violations**

#### **Case 1**
- **Activities in Order:**
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **Evaluation:**  
  This case adheres strictly to the normative rules:
  - Credit Check occurs before Risk Assessment.
  - Risk Assessment occurs before Loan Decision.
  - Inform Applicant occurs after Loan Decision.
  - Since the loan was approved, Finalize Documentation is performed before Close Case.
- **Conclusion:**  
  **No normative rule violations.**

---

#### **Case 2**
- **Activities in Order:**
  - Application Received  Risk Assessment  Credit Check  Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **Evaluation:**  
  - **Violation 1:** Risk Assessment is performed before Credit Check. According to the normative rules, Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.  
  - **Violation 2:** Finalize Documentation is performed after a rejection. The normative rules explicitly state that documentation should not be finalized if the loan is rejected.  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Two normative rule violations:**  
  1. Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check.  
  2. Finalize Documentation performed after a rejection.

---

#### **Case 3**
- **Activities in Order:**
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **Evaluation:**  
  - Credit Check occurs before Risk Assessment.
  - Risk Assessment occurs before Loan Decision.
  - Inform Applicant occurs after Loan Decision.
  - Since the loan was approved, Finalize Documentation is performed before Close Case.
- **Conclusion:**  
  **No normative rule violations.**

---

### **2. Identifying Desiderata Failures**

#### **Case 1**
- **Desiderata Evaluation:**  
  - Credit Check is completed within 30 minutes of receiving the application (within the recommended 24-hour window).  
  - Inform Applicant occurs within 2 hours of the Loan Decision (within the recommended 48-hour window).  
  - There is no mention of a Follow-up Call, but this is not a strict requirement.  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **No desiderata failures.**

---

#### **Case 2**
- **Desiderata Evaluation:**  
  - Credit Check is delayed until after Risk Assessment (violates normative rules, as noted above). However, even considering the delay, it happens within 1 hour and 10 minutes of receiving the application, which is still within the 24-hour desideratum.  
  - Inform Applicant is not recorded, so there is no way to evaluate whether this occurred within 48 hours of the Loan Decision.  
  - There is no mention of a Follow-up Call, but this is not a strict requirement.  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **No clear desiderata failures beyond the normative violations already identified.**

---

#### **Case 3**
- **Desiderata Evaluation:**  
  - **Failure 1:** Credit Check occurs more than 48 hours after Application Received (on January 14, instead of January 12). This violates the recommendation to complete the Credit Check within 24 hours.  
  - **Failure 2:** Inform Applicant occurs more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision (on January 16, instead of January 14). This violates the recommendation to inform the applicant promptly.  
  - **Failure 3:** There is no record of a Follow-up Call, though this is not a strict requirement.  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Three desiderata failures:**  
  1. Delayed Credit Check (beyond 24 hours).  
  2. Delayed Inform Applicant (beyond 48 hours).  
  3. No Follow-up Call (though not required).

### **3. Interpretations and Justifications**

#### **Case 1**
- **Interpretation:**  
  This case follows all normative rules and desiderata recommendations. It represents an ideal process execution with no deviations or suboptimal behavior.  

---

#### **Case 2**
- **Interpretation:**  
  - The premature Risk Assessment may indicate a misunderstanding or miscommunication about the process sequence. Alternatively, it could reflect an attempt to expedite the process, leading to procedural errors.  
  - Finalizing Documentation after a rejection suggests either a clerical error or a lack of clarity about the decision logic.  
- **Justification:**  
  These violations are serious because they undermine the integrity of the process. Training on the importance of sequence adherence and decision logic could help prevent such issues.

---

#### **Case 3**
- **Interpretation:**  
  - The delayed Credit Check and Inform Applicant activities suggest inefficiencies or resource constraints in processing applications. For example, the team might have been overwhelmed by other tasks, causing delays.  
  - The absence of a Follow-up Call might indicate oversight or a deliberate choice to skip this optional step due to time constraints.  
- **Justification:**  
  While these deviations are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior that could impact customer satisfaction. Addressing these issues through reminders or process improvements could enhance efficiency and service quality.

### **Final Answer**

1. **Normative Rule Violations:**  
   - **Case 2** violates two normative rules: performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check and finalizing documentation after rejection.  
   - **Cases 1 and 3** have no normative violations.

2. **Desiderata Failures:**  
   - **Case 1** has no desiderata failures.  
   - **Case 2** has no clear desiderata failures beyond its normative violations.  
   - **Case 3** fails three desiderata: delayed Credit Check, delayed Inform Applicant, and no Follow-up Call.

3. **Suggestions for Improvement:**  
   - Provide training on normative rules to prevent sequence errors (e.g., Case 2).  
   - Implement reminders or alerts to ensure timely completion of Credit Checks and Inform Applicant steps (e.g., Case 3).  
   - Encourage optional best practices like Follow-up Calls to improve customer experience.  

**Boxed Final Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{
\text{Case 2 violates normative rules; Case 3 fails desiderata conditions; Case 1 is optimal.}
}
