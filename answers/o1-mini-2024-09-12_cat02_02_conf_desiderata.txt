### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**

**_Case 2_** violates the normative (strict) rules in two significant ways:

- **a. Incorrect Activity Order:**
  - **Issue:** The **Risk Assessment** was performed **before** the **Credit Check**.
  - **Normative Violation:** According to the strict sequence, the **Credit Check** must occur **before** the **Risk Assessment**.
  
- **b. Contradictory Action Post-Decision:**
  - **Issue:** After the **Loan Decision (Rejected)**, the process proceeded to **Finalize Documentation**.
  - **Normative Violation:** Finalizing documentation is **only allowed** if the loan is **approved**. Performing this step after a rejection is strictly prohibited.

**_Case 1_** adheres fully to the normative rules and does **not** violate any strict constraints.

**_Case 3_** does **not** violate any normative rules but fails to comply with the **desiderata** (discussed in the next section).

### **2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions**

**_Case 3_** fails to meet several **desiderata** (recommended but not mandatory) conditions, indicating suboptimal behavior:

- **a. Timeliness of Credit Check:**
  - **Issue:** The **Credit Check** was conducted **more than 24 hours** after the **Application Received**.
  - **Desideratum Violation:** Ideally, the credit check should be completed **within 24 hours** of receiving the application.
  
- **b. Promptness in Informing Applicant:**
  - **Issue:** The **Inform Applicant** activity occurred **more than 48 hours** after the **Loan Decision**.
  - **Desideratum Violation:** Applicants should be informed **promptly**, preferably **within 48 hours** of the loan decision.
  
- **c. Absence of Follow-up Call:**
  - **Issue:** There was **no Follow-up Call** made to the applicant before closing the case.
  - **Desideratum Violation:** Performing a follow-up call is **encouraged** to ensure all parties are aligned, even though it's not strictly required.

**_Case 1_** and **_Case 2_** do not present any issues related to the desiderata. However, it's worth noting that **Case 2** also violates normative rules, which are more critical than desiderata.

### **3. Interpretations and Justifications for Observed Behaviors**

- **_Case 2:_**
  - **Possible Justification for Activity Order Violation:** It's possible that an urgent decision was needed, prompting the **Risk Assessment** to begin immediately. However, this bypasses the required **Credit Check**, potentially increasing the risk of an uninformed decision.
  - **Possible Justification for Finalizing Documentation Post-Rejection:** This might have been an oversight or due to system errors where the closure process was not properly guided by the rejection status.

- **_Case 3:_**
  - **Delayed Credit Check:** The delay might have been caused by resource constraints, such as limited availability of personnel to perform credit checks promptly.
  - **Delayed Informing of Applicant:** There could have been internal communication delays or awaiting additional approvals before informing the applicant.
  - **No Follow-up Call:** The omission might stem from prioritizing speed in closing the case or a lack of established protocols for follow-up communications.

These interpretations suggest areas for process improvement, such as enhancing resource allocation, automating notifications, or providing additional training to ensure both normative and desiderata conditions are met more consistently.
