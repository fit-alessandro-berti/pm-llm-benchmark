To capture the main flow, the optional repeating loop for missing information and re-validation, and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival, the process tree can be structured as follows:

```
+ ( 
    -> ( 
        'Receive Application (RA)', 
        -> ( 
            'Validate Form (VF)', 
            -> ( 
                'Assess Eligibility (AE)', 
                * ( 
                    -> ( 
                        'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 
                        'Validate Form (VF)' 
                    ), 
                    -> ( 
                        'Approval Decision (AD)', 
                        -> ( 
                            'Send Confirmation (SC)', 
                            'Archive Case (AC)' 
                        ) 
                    ) 
                ) 
            ) 
        ) 
    ) 
)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Main Sequence:**
   - The process starts with `Receive Application (RA)`.
   - Followed by `Validate Form (VF)`.
   - Then, `Assess Eligibility (AE)`.

2. **Optional Loop for Missing Information and Re-validation:**
   - After `Assess Eligibility (AE)`, there is a loop that can repeat the following sequence:
     - `Request Missing Info (RMI)`.
     - `Validate Form (VF)`.
   - The loop can exit at any point and proceed to the next steps.

3. **Final Steps:**
   - After the loop (if it is exited), the process continues with `Approval Decision (AD)`.
   - Followed by `Send Confirmation (SC)`.
   - Finally, `Archive Case (AC)`.

                            - **Label**: `Archive Case (AC)`

This process tree captures the main flow of activities, the optional repeating loop for missing information and re-validation, and the final steps of approval, confirmation, and archival.
