Okay, so I have to figure out which cases in the event log violate the normative process described. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, I'll read the normative process description carefully. It says the process starts with "Receive order," then moves to "Check inventory." After that, if inventory is sufficient, it proceeds to "Authorize payment," then "Package items," "Ship order," and finally "Close order." If inventory is insufficient, it goes to "Cancel order" and then directly to "Close order."

Looking at the event log, each case has a sequence of activities with timestamps. I need to check each case against the expected flow.

Starting with Case 1:
- Receive order at 09:00
- Check inventory at 10:00
- Authorize payment at 11:00
- Package items at 12:00
- Ship order at 13:00
- Close order at 14:00

This seems to follow the correct sequence for sufficient inventory. So, Case 1 is okay.

Case 2:
- Receive order at 09:00
- Check inventory at 09:30
- Package items at 10:00
- Authorize payment at 10:30
- Ship order at 11:00
- Close order at 11:30

Wait, this is out of order. The process should check inventory before authorizing payment or packaging. Here, they're packaging before authorizing payment, and they skipped the "Authorize payment" step before packaging. So, this violates the process because "Package items" should only come after "Authorize payment."

Case 3:
- Receive order at 09:00
- Check inventory at 09:20
- Authorize payment at 09:40
- Cancel order at 10:00
- Ship order at 10:30
- Close order at 11:00

Hmm, after canceling the order, they're shipping it. That's not allowed. The description says after cancellation, they should close the order and not proceed with shipping. So shipping after cancellation is a violation.

Case 4:
- Receive order at 09:00
- Check inventory at 09:10
- Cancel order at 09:20
- Close order at 09:50

This seems okay. They checked inventory, canceled, and closed. No issues here.

Case 5:
- Receive order at 09:00
- Check inventory at 10:00
- Authorize payment at 10:30
- Ship order at 11:00
- Close order at 11:30

This flows correctly for sufficient inventory. So, Case 5 is fine.

Wait, but in Case 2, they skipped "Authorize payment" before packaging, which is against the rules. So Case 2 is definitely a violation.

In Case 3, after canceling, they shipped, which is incorrect. So that's another violation.

I think that's it. Cases 2 and 3 violate the normative process.

Based on the analysis of the event log against the provided normative process, the following cases are identified as violating the process:

### Case 2 Violation:
- **Activities**: Receive, Check Inventory, Package Items, Authorize Payment, Ship Order, Close Order.
- **Violation**: "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment," which violates the rule that payment authorization must precede packaging.

### Case 3 Violation:
- **Activities**: Receive, Check Inventory, Authorize Payment, Cancel Order, Ship Order, Close Order.
- **Violation**: "Ship order" occurred after the order was canceled, which is not allowed as per the process flow.

### Summary of Violations:
1. **Case 2**: The process deviated by packaging items before authorizing payment.
2. **Case 3**: The process incorrectly shipped an order after it had been canceled.

### Explanation:
- **Case 2**: The sequence skipped the necessary "Authorize payment" step before proceeding to "Package items," leading to a deviation from the intended flow.
- **Case 3**: After canceling the order, the process should terminate with "Close order" without proceeding to "Ship order," hence this deviation is considered a violation.
