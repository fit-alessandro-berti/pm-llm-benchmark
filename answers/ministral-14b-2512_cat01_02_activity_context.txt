### **Analysis & Renaming of Recurring Activities**

The event log contains three recurring activities that change meaning based on context:
1. **`Verify Documents`** – Appears twice in each case, with different purposes (initial check vs. re-verification after corrections).
2. **`Call Customer`** – Appears multiple times, with different triggers (missing docs, account clarification, follow-up).
3. **`Adjust Account`** – Appears once per case but could be further contextualized based on the reason (e.g., missing info vs. discrepancy resolution).

### **Justification for Renaming Choices**

1. **`Verify Documents`  `Initial Document Verification` / `Re-Verify Documents`**
   - **Contextual Clues:**
     - In **C001**, the first verification fails, leading to a customer call. The second verification happens after the missing docs are uploaded.
     - In **C003**, the first verification is incomplete (customer steps out), and the second happens after an account adjustment.
   - **Rationale:**
     - The first occurrence is always an **initial check**, while the second is a **re-check** after corrections or new information.

2. **`Call Customer`  Context-Specific Names**
   - **Contextual Clues:**
     - **C001:** Triggered by **missing documents**  **"Call Customer for Missing Docs"**
     - **C002:** Triggered by **account discrepancy**  **"Call Customer for Clarification"**
     - **C003:** Triggered by **customer leaving**  **"Call Customer to Return"**
     - **C002 (second call):** A **follow-up**  **"Follow-Up Call for Confirmation"**
   - **Rationale:**
     - The purpose of the call varies—whether it's for **missing info, clarification, or follow-up**—so the name should reflect the **trigger and intent**.

3. **`Adjust Account`  Contextualized (Optional but Helpful)**
   - **Contextual Clues:**
     - **C002:** Adjustment due to **account discrepancy** (from the call).
     - **C003:** Adjustment due to **missing info** (from initial verification).
   - **Rationale:**
     - While not strictly necessary, adding the **reason** (e.g., "Discrepancy" vs. "Missing Info") improves traceability in complex workflows.

### **Key Improvements in the Revised Log**
 **Disambiguation:** Each activity now clearly indicates its **role in the process flow**.
 **Traceability:** It’s easier to see **why** a call was made or **when** re-verification was needed.
 **Process Clarity:** The log now better reflects **real-world workflows**, where the same activity can mean different things at different stages.
