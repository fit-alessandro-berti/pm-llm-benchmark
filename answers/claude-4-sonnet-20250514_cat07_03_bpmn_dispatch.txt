This is a business process diagram (also known as a BPMN - Business Process Model and Notation diagram) that illustrates a shipping and logistics workflow. The diagram is organized into several swimlanes representing different organizational roles:

**Swimlanes (from top to bottom):**
- Logistics
- Dispatch/Order Shop/Computer Hardware/Secretary  
- Warehouse

**Key Process Flow:**
The process begins with "Ship goods" and follows this general sequence:

1. **Shipment Method Clarification**: The process starts by clarifying the shipment method, with a decision point for special handling requirements.

2. **Insurance Check**: There's a step to check if insurance is required, accessing customer information from a database.

3. **Logistics Coordination**: If special handling is needed, the process involves getting offers from 3 logistics companies and selecting one to place an order with.

4. **Documentation**: The process includes writing package labels and insuring parcels when necessary.

5. **Warehousing**: Goods are packaged in the warehouse, with a 48-hour timer element and provisions for notifying customers about delays.

6. **Final Steps**: The process concludes with filling out shipment paperwork and moving packages to the pickup area.

**Diagram Elements:**
- Rectangular boxes represent tasks/activities
- Diamond shapes represent decision points/gateways
- Circles represent start/end events
- A cylinder shape represents a data store (customer information)
- Arrows show the flow direction
- A clock symbol indicates a timer event

This visualization effectively maps out the complete logistics process from initial shipping request to final package preparation for pickup.
