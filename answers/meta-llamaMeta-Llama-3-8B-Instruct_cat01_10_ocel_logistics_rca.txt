After analyzing the directly-follows graph for each object type, I've identified some potential root causes for performance issues in the process:

**Items**

1. **Pick item** is a frequent and long-duration event (179085.13 seconds). This might indicate that the process is spending a significant amount of time selecting or processing items. Investigating the order and placement of items might help alleviate this bottleneck.
2. The object-centric nature of the process suggests that there might be inefficient loops or recursive relationships between items, leading to excessive processing or iterations. Analyzing the graph for item-centric patterns could help identify these issues.

**Employees**

While employee activities seem less frequent and shorter-duration compared to items, some insights can still be gained:

1. **Pick item** is also a frequent event for employees, indicating that employees might be spending considerable time selecting or processing items. Examining employee workloads or optimizing item selection could improve performance.
2. The graph reveals some employee-specific patterns (e.g., "pick item" -> "item out of stock") that might indicate inefficient or unnecessary processing. Investigating these relationships could help streamline employee activities.

**Orders**

While orders seem relatively straightforward, some aspects warrant inspection:

1. **Place order** and **Confirm order** are frequent and long-duration events. Investigating the order placement and confirmation process could help identify inefficiencies or bottlenecks.
2. The graph shows some order-specific patterns (e.g., "place order" -> "confirm order") that might indicate unnecessary or redundant processing. Analyzing these relationships could help optimize order submission and confirmation.

**Products**

Given the product-centric nature of the process, some insights can be gained from analyzing product relationships:

1. **Create package** and **Pick item** are frequent events, indicating that product selection and packaging might be a frequent and time-consuming process. Investigating product packaging and selection could help optimize product preparation.
2. The graph reveals some product-specific patterns (e.g., "create package" -> "pick item") that might indicate inefficient or unnecessary processing. Examining these relationships could help streamline product preparation.

**Packages**

1. The graph shows a frequent and long-duration relationship between **Create package** and **Send package**, indicating that package preparation and shipping might be a time-consuming process. Investigating package preparation and shipping could help identify inefficiencies or bottlenecks.

To further investigate these potential root causes, you may want to:

* Analyze the process graphs for each object type using techniques like frequency analysis, duration analysis, or graph
