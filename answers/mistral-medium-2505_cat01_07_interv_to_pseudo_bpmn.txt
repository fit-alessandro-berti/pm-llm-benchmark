### **BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

#### **Process Overview**
This model describes the end-to-end invoice approval workflow, capturing standard paths, decision points, roles, and exceptions based on stakeholder interviews.

---

### **1. Process Steps & Sequence Flow**

#### **Start Event**
- **Trigger:** Invoice received (typically via email).

#### **Main Path (Standard Flow)**
1. **Check for Valid PO Number (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary)**
   - If **no PO number**  Send back to supplier for correction.
   - If **PO number exists**  Proceed to logging.

2. **Log Invoice in Accounting System (Mary)**
   - Invoice details are recorded.

3. **Forward to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation (Mary  Dan)**
   - Purchasing Officer (Dan) verifies:
     - Quantities match PO.
     - Prices match PO.
     - Delivery charges (if applicable) are correct.
   - **If discrepancies found:**
     - Contact supplier for correction.
     - Hold invoice until resolved.
   - **If no discrepancies:**
     - Send confirmation back to Accounts Payable.

4. **Match Invoice to PO (Mary)**
   - Verify line items against PO in the system.
   - **If match successful:**
     - Proceed to manager approval.
   - **If mismatch:**
     - Escalate to Purchasing for clarification.
     - If unresolved  Escalate to Supervisor (Rita).

5. **Manager Approval (Carlos)**
   - System sends automated approval request.
   - **If approved:**
     - Proceed to payment scheduling.
   - **If rejected:**
     - Return to Accounts Payable for investigation.

6. **Schedule Payment (Mary)**
   - Invoice added to payment run.

#### **Exception Paths**
- **Missing PO Number:**
  - Supplier contacted to provide PO (Karen may assist).
  - If no PO exists  Supervisor (Rita) coordinates retrospective PO or rejection.
- **Discrepancies in Invoice/PO Matching:**
  - Purchasing (Dan) or Supervisor (Rita) resolves with supplier.
  - If unresolved  Invoice held until corrected.
- **Manager Rejection:**
  - Invoice returned to Accounts Payable for rework.

### **2. Roles & Responsibilities**
| **Role**                     | **Responsibilities**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accounts Payable Clerk**   | Initial validation, logging, PO matching, escalation, payment scheduling.          |
| **Purchasing Officer**       | Verify receipt of goods, confirm PO details, resolve discrepancies.               |
| **Department Manager**       | Final approval/rejection of invoices.                                               |
| **Accounts Payable Supervisor** | Handles exceptions, missing POs, supplier coordination.                          |
| **Supplier Relationship Manager** | Assists in resolving supplier-related issues (missing POs, pricing disputes). |

### **3. Gateways & Decision Points**
- **PO Validation (Start):**
  - **Yes PO?**  Log invoice.
  - **No PO?**  Return to supplier.
- **Purchasing Confirmation:**
  - **Matches PO?**  Proceed to manager.
  - **Discrepancy?**  Hold for correction.
- **Manager Approval:**
  - **Approved?**  Schedule payment.
  - **Rejected?**  Return for rework.

---

### **4. Artifacts & Data Objects**
- **Inputs:**
  - Invoice (email attachment).
  - Purchase Order (PO) reference.
- **Outputs:**
  - Logged invoice in accounting system.
  - Approval/rejection notifications.
  - Payment schedule entry.

---

### **5. Notes on Ambiguities & Variations**
- **Supplier Interaction:**
  - Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager) assists in resolving disputes but does not directly approve invoices.
- **Retrospective POs:**
  - Some invoices lack POs initially; Rita coordinates with department heads to create one.
- **System Automation:**
  - Manager approval requests are automated, but manual follow-ups may occur for rejections.

---

### **6. Visualization Guidance**
- **Standard Flow:** Linear sequence with decision diamonds for PO validation, purchasing confirmation, and manager approval.
- **Exception Paths:** Branches for missing POs, discrepancies, and rejections.
- **Roles:** Swimlanes for Accounts Payable, Purchasing, Manager, and Supervisor.

This model can be directly translated into a BPMN diagram with clear swimlanes, gateways, and exception handling paths.
