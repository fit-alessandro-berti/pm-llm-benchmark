### Updated `declare_model` with Bias-Mitigating Constraints

Below is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints added to mitigate potential biases in the loan application process. Each addition is explained in the rationale section.

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},  # Ensure ManualReview exists for fairness checks
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Ensure BiasMitigationCheck exists
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Coexistence for sensitive decisions
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}   # Coexistence for sensitive decisions
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Response constraint to ensure fairness
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Response constraint to ensure fairness
    },
    "precedence": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Precedence constraint to ensure fairness
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Non-succession to prevent immediate bias
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Non-succession to prevent immediate bias
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints

1. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - **Constraint:** Added `"ManualReview"` and `"BiasMitigationCheck"` under `"existence"`.
   - **Rationale:** These activities are critical for ensuring that decisions involving sensitive attributes (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`) undergo additional scrutiny to avoid biased outcomes.

2. **Coexistence of `ManualReview` with Sensitive Decisions:**
   - **Constraint:** Added `"Approve_Minority"`  `"ManualReview"` and `"Reject_Minority"`  `"ManualReview"` under `"coexistence"`.
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that any decision (`Approve` or `Reject`) made for applicants from sensitive demographics (e.g., minorities) must always coexist with a `ManualReview`. This prevents automated systems from making potentially biased decisions without human oversight.

3. **Response Constraint for Bias Mitigation Checks:**
   - **Constraint:** Added `"CheckApplicantRace"`  `"BiasMitigationCheck"` and `"CheckApplicantGender"`  `"BiasMitigationCheck"` under `"response"`.
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that whenever sensitive attributes like race or gender are checked, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must follow. This step introduces a safeguard to prevent immediate biased decisions based on these attributes.

4. **Precedence Constraint for Final Decision:**
   - **Constraint:** Added `"BiasMitigationCheck"`  `"FinalDecision"` under `"precedence"`.
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that no final decision (`Approve`, `Reject`) can be made without first performing a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This enforces fairness by requiring an explicit check before reaching a conclusion.

5. **Non-Succession Constraints to Prevent Immediate Bias:**
   - **Constraint:** Added `"CheckApplicantRace"`  `"Reject"` and `"CheckApplicantGender"`  `"Reject"` under `"nonsuccession"`.
   - **Rationale:** Prevents a direct succession from checking sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) to rejecting an application. This ensures that decisions are not made immediately after encountering sensitive information, reducing the risk of implicit bias.

### Summary of Impact

The added constraints collectively enforce fairness and reduce bias in the loan application process by:
- Introducing mandatory checks (`ManualReview`, `BiasMitigationCheck`) for sensitive decisions.
- Preventing immediate transitions from sensitive attribute checks to biased outcomes.
- Ensuring that all decisions undergo appropriate scrutiny before being finalized.

These measures help align the process with ethical standards and promote equitable treatment for all applicants, regardless of sensitive attributes.
