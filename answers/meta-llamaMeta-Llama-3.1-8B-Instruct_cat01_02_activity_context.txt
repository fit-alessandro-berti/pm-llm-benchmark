### Identified Activities with Changing Meanings

- **Initiate Request**: This activity appears in all cases but serves different purposes based on the channel (online portal, walk-in at branch) and case specifics (request for service, adjustment). This suggests renaming it to indicate the starting point of a case or the initial request, irrespective of the channel or case type.

- **Verify Documents**: In cases C001 and C003, this activity is performed twice, each time involving different types of verification (identity documents, ID scan, physical verification) and possibly different agents (BackOfficeAgent, BranchOfficer). The activity name should reflect the document verification aspect across different contexts.

- **Call Customer**: The activity appears in cases C001 and C002, but serves distinct purposes: one is for missing documents, the other for account discrepancies. A renaming that highlights the call's purpose or the reason for the call would be more informative.

- **Submit Additional**: This appears only once in C001, where a customer uploads an ID scan. Renaming it could focus on the action of providing additional information.

- **Adjust Account**: In case C002, it's mentioned as adjusting account details due to a call for clarification. In case C003, it's internal correction due to missing info. The renaming should reflect the action of adjusting accounts, possibly indicating the reason for the adjustment.
