Based on the provided data, I will attempt to identify the key steps and activities involved in the process and create a simplified DECLARE model.

Please note that DECLARE is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) language, which is used to define business processes and workflows. The code I provide below is a basic representation of the process in a DECLARE format.

Here's an attempt at creating a DECLARE model for the provided process:

```
DECLARE
  PROCESS Create_Fine
    ONCREATE Fine notification
      SEND Send_Fine()
        FROM Send_Fine() 
          INSERT Insert_Fine_Notification();
        
    ONINSERT Date_Appeal_to Prefecture
          INSERT Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture()
            INSERT Appeal_to_Judge();
      
    ONSEND Payment
      SEND Payment()
        FROM Payment()?;
        
  END PROCESS;
```

In this model, I've created a `CREATE_FINE` process that responds to a `Fine` notification. Upon creation of the fine, it sends a `Send Fine()` activity, which inserts a fine notification.

The process then waits for either an `Appeal to Prefecture` or a `Payment` event from the user. If `Appeal to Prefecture` is received, it creates another process (`Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture`) to insert dates and appeals information into the database. This new process also sends an updated notification.

If no new events are received after triggering this new process, the system waits for a `Payment` event from the user, which sends payment notifications with inserted fine information.

Please note that this is a simplified model and might not cover all possible conditions and scenarios presented in the original data. It's also worth mentioning that DECLARE has its own dialects (like BPMN/DCMI), but the code above represents an interpretation of the process as it would be written in a DECLARE-like syntax.

Also, to improve readability, I used some abbreviations like `?` for undefined values or functions which are usually not typed by the declare language
