Here is a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the described order fulfillment process, including plausible declarative constraints:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # Activities that always occur the same number of times
    'equivalence': {
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),      # Shipping label is generated exactly once before dispatch
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')        # Typically invoice issued equals payment recorded
    },

    # If the first activity occurs, the second should have occurred before (strict ordering dependencies)
    'always_before': {
        ('Check Availability', 'Receive Order'),      # Can't check before receiving the order
        ('Reserve Items', 'Check Availability'),      # Reserve only after checking availability
        ('Pick Items', 'Reserve Items'),               # Pick after reserving
        ('Quality Check', 'Pick Items'),               # QC after picking
        ('Pack Order', 'Quality Check'),               # Pack after QC
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Pack Order'),    # Generate label after packing
        ('Dispatch', 'Generate Shipping Label'),      # Dispatch after label generated
        ('Record Payment', 'Invoice Customer')        # Payment recorded after invoicing
    },

    # If the first activity occurs, the second is guaranteed at some point after
    'always_after': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    },

    # Activities that never coexist in the same case
    # (none strictly conflicting in this scenario)
    'never_together': set(),

    # Allowed occurrence counts for each activity per case
    'activ_freq': {
        'Receive Order': {1},
        'Check Availability': {1},
        'Reserve Items': {1},
        'Pick Items': {1},
        'Quality Check': {0, 1},    # QC might be skipped for low-risk items
        'Pack Order': {1},
        'Generate Shipping Label': {1},
        'Dispatch': {1},
        'Invoice Customer': {1},
        'Record Payment': {0, 1}    # Payment might not be recorded if order was canceled or unpaid
    },

    # If first occurs directly followed by the second in the trace patterns
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Equivalence:** The shipping label and dispatch should be paired; similarly, invoicing and recording payment are expected to have matching occurrences.
  
- **Always Before:** Defines strict ordering—activities must have happened before their dependent activities.

- **Always After:** Activities must follow prior steps as the process unfolds.

- **Never Together:** No mutually exclusive activities in this process; all activities can potentially happen in the same trace.

- **Activity Occurrences:** Most activities occur exactly once, except the optional `Quality Check` and `Record Payment` which can be skipped under some circumstances.

- **Directly Follows:** Enforces a direct sequence in typical successful order flows.

This Log Skeleton captures the essential constraints suitable for auditing or conformance checking of order fulfillment logs.
