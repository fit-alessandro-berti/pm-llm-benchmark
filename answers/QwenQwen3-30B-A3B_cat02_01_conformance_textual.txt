Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process described and then check each case in the event log to see if they follow it correctly. 

The normative process starts with "Receive order," then "Check inventory." After that, if inventory is sufficient, the steps are: Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order. If inventory is insufficient, it goes to Cancel order, then Close order. 

Key constraints mentioned are:
- Authorize payment must be after Check inventory and before packaging.
- Package items after authorization and before shipping.
- Ship order after packaging and not after cancellation.
- Close order is the final step in all cases.

Now, let's go through each case one by one.

Case 1:
Activities: Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. This seems to follow the correct sequence for sufficient inventory. All steps are in order. No violations here.

Case 2:
Activities: Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, here they packaged items before authorizing payment. According to the rules, package should come after authorization. So this is a violation. The order is Check, then Package, then Authorize. That's wrong because payment should be authorized before packaging. So this case is violating the constraint that package must be after authorization.

Case 3:
Activities: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. After canceling, they ship the order. But the norm says that once canceled, you shouldn't proceed with shipping. The cancellation should lead directly to Close. So shipping after cancellation is a violation. Also, the order here is Check, Authorize, Cancel, then Ship. But after cancellation, shipping is not allowed. So this is a problem.

Case 4:
Activities: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. This follows the correct path for insufficient inventory. No issues here.

Case 5:
Activities: Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Here, they ship before packaging. The norm says shipping must be after packaging. So this is a violation. They skipped the package step and went directly from authorize to ship. That's not allowed.

So the violating cases are 2, 3, and 5. Let me double-check each one.

Case 2: Package before Authorize. Yes, that's against the rule that package comes after authorize. 

Case 3: After Cancel, they Ship. The process says after cancel, you should Close, not Ship. So that's a violation.

Case 5: Ship before Package. Correct, because packaging must come before shipping.

I think that's all. Cases 2, 3, and 5 have issues. Let me make sure there's no other violations. For example, in Case 3, after canceling, they have Ship. The description says that once canceled, it's illogical to continue with fulfillment activities like packaging or shipping. So shipping after cancellation is definitely a violation.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should list these three cases and explain each violation.

**Analysis of Event Log Cases:**

### **Violating Cases:**
1. **Case 2**
2. **Case 3**
3. **Case 5**

---

### **Detailed Violations:**

#### **Case 2:**
- **Sequence:** `Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order`
- **Violation:**  
  **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."**  
  According to the normative process, **"Package items" must follow "Authorize payment"** (as payment must be validated before preparing items for shipment). This sequence violates the rule that **"Package items" should only occur after authorization** and **before shipping**.  
  **Rule Violated:** *"Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping.*

---

#### **Case 3:**
- **Sequence:** `Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order`
- **Violation:**  
  **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."**  
  The normative process states that **once an order is canceled, it is illogical to proceed with fulfillment activities like shipping**. After cancellation, the process should directly transition to "Close order," not "Ship order."  
  **Rule Violated:** *"Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.*

---

#### **Case 5:**
- **Sequence:** `Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order`
- **Violation:**  
  **"Ship order" occurs before "Package items."**  
  The process explicitly requires **"Package items" to precede "Ship order"** (items must be prepared before shipping). This case skips the packaging step entirely, violating the sequence.  
  **Rule Violated:** *"Ship order" should only occur after packaging.*

---

### **Non-Violating Cases:**
- **Case 1:** Follows the correct sequence for sufficient inventory (`Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close`).  
- **Case 4:** Follows the correct sequence for insufficient inventory (`Receive  Check  Cancel  Close`).  

---

### **Conclusion:**
The violations in **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5** stem from deviations in the required order of activities, specifically:
- **Incorrect ordering of "Package items" and "Authorize payment."**
- **Shipping after cancellation.**
- **Skipping "Package items" before shipping.**

These deviations contradict the normative process's constraints on activity sequencing and logical flow.
