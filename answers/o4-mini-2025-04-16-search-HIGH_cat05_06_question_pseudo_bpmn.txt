1. What strategic factors drive the selection of Taiwan for microprocessors, Japan for camera modules, South Korea for OLED screens, and Germany & the USA for sensors and memory, and how might those choices evolve with changing market conditions?  
2. In what ways could consolidating or diversifying supplier regions improve cost efficiency, lead-time reliability, and geopolitical risk mitigation in the component-securing phase?  
3. How might emerging technologies (e.g., AI-driven demand forecasting or additive manufacturing) reshape the “Design Prototype” and “Secure Components” tasks to accelerate time-to-market?  
4. What specific risk-management frameworks are applied to assess and monitor supplier stability, and how could these frameworks be enhanced to capture non-traditional risks (e.g., cyberattacks on a supplier’s network)?  
5. How does the parallel sourcing of components balance speed against complexity, and what metrics best capture the trade-offs between supply-chain agility and coordination overhead?  
6. What would be the operational impact of shifting a portion of assembly capacity closer to end-markets (e.g., nearshoring to North America or Europe), and how should that decision be evaluated?  
7. How are quality-control thresholds defined at the “Quality Checks & Diagnostics” task, and what continuous improvement methodologies ensure those thresholds remain aligned with customer expectations?  
8. In the event of component shortages or sudden spikes in demand, how is the “Rework or Scrap” decision calibrated to minimize waste while maintaining product integrity?  
9. What digital tools or collaborative platforms could enhance real-time communication among R&D, procurement, assembly, and logistics stakeholders to reduce information silos?  
10. How could integrating blockchain or distributed-ledger technology improve traceability and trust across the parallel procurement and distribution gateways?  
11. What key performance indicators (KPIs) are most effective for monitoring end-to-end cycle time, inventory turns, and fill rates, and how frequently should these KPIs be reviewed?  
12. How is the decision made between air freight to high-demand markets versus ocean freight to other markets, and what economic or environmental trade-off analyses inform that decision?  
13. What process governance mechanisms ensure that the “Customs Clearance & Regulatory Compliance” task adapts swiftly to changing trade regulations or tariffs?  
14. How might advanced analytics or machine-learning models improve the accuracy of the “Monitor Inventory & Sales Forecast” task, and what governance is needed to trust those models?  
15. In what ways can cross-functional teams collaborate to optimize the parallel distribution activities (warehousing, retailer distribution, e-commerce fulfillment, direct VIP shipments) without duplicating effort?  
16. How should feedback loops be structured between regional distribution centers and headquarters to inform supplier order adjustments in near-real time?  
17. What stakeholder-communication strategies are critical when adjusting orders to suppliers mid-cycle, to maintain relationships and avoid penalties?  
18. How do you measure the environmental and social governance (ESG) impact of each major task (e.g., component sourcing, assembly, transportation), and how could these metrics drive process redesign?  
19. What decision-making frameworks guide the choice to “Proceed to Next Sales Cycle” versus “Adjust Orders to Suppliers,” and how can those frameworks incorporate both quantitative data and qualitative market insights?  
20. How can scenario-planning exercises be embedded in the process to prepare for extreme disruptions (pandemics, trade wars, natural disasters), and what governance is needed to activate contingency plans?
