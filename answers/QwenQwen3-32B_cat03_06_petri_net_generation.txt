<think>
Okay, let's try to model this insurance claim process as a Petri net. First, I need to recall how Petri nets work. Places represent states or conditions, transitions represent activities, and arcs connect them. Tokens in places indicate the current state.

The scenario has several steps: C, CR, DV, FC, CA, AP, P, N, CL. Also, there are loops for RDS after DV if documents are incomplete, and II after FC if fraud is suspected. These loops mean that after DV, if there's a need for RDS, the process goes back. Similarly for FC to II.

Let me outline the steps in order. Starting with the initial place for the new claim (C). Then CR. After CR comes DV. After DV, there's a check for document completeness. If complete, proceed to FC. If not, go to RDS, then back to DV again. So between DV and RDS, there's a loop. Similarly, after FC, there's a check for fraud. If no fraud, proceed to CA. If fraud, go to II, then back to FC again.

Then, after CA, if the amount is above threshold, go to AP, then P. Otherwise, directly to P. Then N, then CL. The final marking is when CL is done.

So I need to model these transitions and places. Let me think about the places. Each activity's input and output places. For example, the initial place for C, then after CR, a place for CR done. Then DV starts. Let me think step by step.

First, the initial marking is a token in a place representing the claim being filed (C). Let's call that place p_c. Then, the first transition is CR (Claim Registration). So p_c connects to CR transition. After CR, a place p_cr_done. Then DV transition. After DV, there's a decision point. But in Petri nets, we can't have direct decisions like in BPMN. Instead, we need to model possible loops with places and transitions.

For the DV to RDS loop: After DV, there's a place that can either go to FC (if documents are okay) or to RDS (if not). But how to model that? Maybe a place after DV that splits into two options. However, since Petri nets are not conditional, but can have parallel paths. So perhaps after DV, there's a place that can go to RDS (and then back to DV again) or proceed to FC. But how to model that choice? Maybe using a place that connects to both RDS and FC transitions. But since it's a Petri net, the choice depends on which transitions are enabled based on tokens.

Wait, but for modeling loops, perhaps we can have a place after DV that can loop back. Let me think: After DV, there's a place p_dv_done. From there, if the documents are incomplete, we go to RDS transition, then back to DV. If they are complete, we go to FC. So maybe p_dv_done connects to both RDS and FC transitions. But how to model that choice? Well, in Petri nets, the firing of transitions depends on tokens. So perhaps there's a way to model this with a place that has arcs to both transitions, but with some guards. However, since Petri nets don't have guards, the model must allow for both possibilities. But since the scenario says that in some cases RDS is needed, and in others not, perhaps we can model it with two possible paths from p_dv_done.

So the structure would be:

p_c --> CR --> p_cr_done --> DV --> p_dv_done --> RDS --> ... back to DV?

Wait, after RDS, the documents are resubmitted, then back to DV again. So RDS would output to a place that connects back to DV. Similarly, from p_dv_done, if we proceed to FC, then after FC, there's a check for fraud. If fraud is found, then II, then back to FC again. So similar structure for FC and II.

Let me try to outline all the transitions and places:

Places:

- p_c: initial place for the claim being filed.
- p_cr_done: after CR.
- p_dv_done: after DV.
- p_rds: after RDS transition, which connects back to DV.
- p_fraud_check_done: after FC.
- p_ii: after II transition, which connects back to FC.
- p_ca_done: after CA.
- p_approval_needed: if approval is required, go to AP.
- p_approval_done: after AP.
- p_payment: after P.
- p_notification_done: after N.
- p_closure: final place for CL.

Transitions:

- CR: Claim Registration.
- DV: Document Verification.
- RDS: Re-Document Submission.
- FC: Fraud Check.
- II: In-depth Investigation.
- CA: Claim Assessment.
- AP: Approval.
- P: Payment.
- N: Notification.
- CL: Closure.

Now, let's connect them.

Start with p_c connected to CR. CR outputs to p_cr_done. Then p_cr_done connected to DV. DV outputs to p_dv_done.

From p_dv_done, there are two options: go to RDS or proceed to FC. So RDS transition takes from p_dv_done and outputs to a place (maybe p_rds_done?), then that connects back to DV. Or maybe RDS outputs directly to DV? Wait, let's think. After RDS, the documents are resubmitted, so the process goes back to DV again. So RDS outputs to a place that connects to DV. Let me create a place p_after_rds which connects to DV. Similarly, from p_dv_done, if documents are okay, proceed to FC.

So:

p_dv_done --> RDS --> p_after_rds --> DV --> p_dv_done again?

Wait, but that would create a loop. Let me structure it:

DV's output is p_dv_done. RDS is a transition that takes from p_dv_done, and outputs to a place that connects back to DV. So:

arc from p_dv_done to RDS transition. Then RDS outputs to a place (say p_rds_done), and from there an arc to DV. Then DV outputs back to p_dv_done. So if RDS is fired, then DV is fired again.

Similarly for FC and II. After FC, which outputs to p_fraud_check_done. From there, two options: go to II (if fraud is suspected) or proceed to CA. So:

p_fraud_check_done connects to II transition, which outputs to p_after_ii, which connects back to FC. Also, p_fraud_check_done connects to CA transition.

So after CA, the process goes to p_ca_done. Then, CA's output is p_ca_done. Then, check if approval is needed. But again, in Petri nets, how to model that? After CA, the amount is assessed. If the amount is above threshold, then AP is needed. Otherwise, skip AP and go directly to P. How to model that?

Perhaps after CA, there's a place p_ca_done that connects to both AP and P. But AP would require approval, and then proceed to P. Wait, but if the amount is under threshold, then AP is not needed. So maybe the transition AP is optional. How to model that?

Let me think. After CA, the p_ca_done has a token. There's a transition AP (Approval) and a transition P (Payment). But if the amount is under threshold, then the token can go directly to P. If over, then go through AP first. So perhaps the structure is:

p_ca_done connects to both AP and P. But AP would require going through approval and then to P. However, if the amount is under threshold, then P can be fired directly. But how to model this in Petri nets without guards?

Ah, perhaps we can have two arcs from p_ca_done: one to AP and one to P. However, in that case, both transitions would be enabled if there's a token in p_ca_done. But in reality, only one of them should be fired based on the amount. But since Petri nets don't have data, we have to model the possible paths. So perhaps the model allows for both possibilities, but the actual process would have only one of them being fired. However, for the Petri net model, we can't enforce that. But since the scenario says that AP is required if the amount surpasses a threshold, but not otherwise, perhaps we can model it with a split and join. Let me think of it as a XOR split and join.

So after CA, there's a place p_ca_done. From there, two transitions: one leading to AP, and one leading to P. But AP would require going through approval and then to P. However, if the amount is under threshold, then P can be fired directly. So the structure would be:

p_ca_done --> AP --> p_approval_done --> P --> p_payment_done.

and

p_ca_done --> P --> p_payment_done.

But then, there's a possibility of both paths being taken. However, in reality, only one is taken. But in Petri nets, this is allowed as long as the model is correct. So perhaps that's acceptable. The model would allow for either path, which aligns with the scenario description.

Once P is done, the process goes to N (Notification), then CL (Closure), which is the final place.

So let's outline all transitions and their connections.

Now, building the Petri net step by step:

1. Create all places and transitions.

Places:

p_c, p_cr_done, p_dv_done, p_after_rds, p_fraud_check_done, p_after_ii, p_ca_done, p_approval_done, p_payment_done, p_notification_done, p_closure.

Transitions:

CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

Now, arcs:

- p_c -> CR
- CR -> p_cr_done
- p_cr_done -> DV
- DV -> p_dv_done
- p_dv_done -> RDS
- RDS -> p_after_rds
- p_after_rds -> DV (so that after RDS, we go back to DV)
- p_dv_done -> FC
- FC -> p_fraud_check_done
- p_fraud_check_done -> II
- II -> p_after_ii
- p_after_ii -> FC (loop back to FC)
- p_fraud_check_done -> CA (if no fraud)
- CA -> p_ca_done
- p_ca_done -> AP (approval needed)
- AP -> p_approval_done
- p_approval_done -> P
- p_ca_done -> P (if no approval needed)
- P -> p_payment_done
- p_payment_done -> N
- N -> p_notification_done
- p_notification_done -> CL
- CL -> p_closure

Wait, but after P, it's N, then CL. So after P, the token goes to p_payment_done, then to N transition, then p_notification_done, then CL transition, then p_closure.

So the arcs for P would be P outputs to p_payment_done. Then p_payment_done connects to N transition. Then N outputs to p_notification_done. Then p_notification_done connects to CL transition, which outputs to p_closure.

Now, the initial marking is a token in p_c. The final marking is a token in p_closure.

Now, let me check if all loops are properly modeled.

For the DV-RDS loop: after DV, p_dv_done has a token. If RDS is fired, then token moves to p_after_rds, then to DV again. So the loop is possible.

For FC-II loop: after FC, p_fraud_check_done has a token. If II is fired, token moves to p_after_ii, then back to FC.

For the CA-AP-P path: after CA, p_ca_done has token. If the amount is over threshold, AP is fired, then P. If under, P is fired directly.

Now, in the Petri net model, there's no data, so both transitions (AP and P) can be enabled. However, in reality, only one is taken. But the Petri net model must allow for both possibilities. So this is acceptable.

Now, let's code this in Python using pm4py.

First, create all the places and transitions. Then add the arcs.

Let me outline the code step by step.

Import necessary modules.

Then create the PetriNet, and all the places, transitions.

Then add arcs between them.

Let me write the code.

First, create the PetriNet:

net = PetriNet("InsuranceClaimProcess")

Then create all the places:

p_c = PetriNet.Place("p_c")
p_cr_done = PetriNet.Place("p_cr_done")
p_dv_done = PetriNet.Place("p_dv_done")
p_after_rds = PetriNet.Place("p_after_rds")
p_fraud_check_done = PetriNet.Place("p_fraud_check_done")
p_after_ii = PetriNet.Place("p_after_ii")
p_ca_done = PetriNet.Place("p_ca_done")
p_approval_done = PetriNet.Place("p_approval_done")
p_payment_done = PetriNet.Place("p_payment_done")
p_notification_done = PetriNet.Place("p_notification_done")
p_closure = PetriNet.Place("p_closure")

Add them to the net's places.

Then create all transitions:

cr = PetriNet.Transition("CR", "Claim Registration")
dv = PetriNet.Transition("DV", "Document Verification")
rds = PetriNet.Transition("RDS", "Re-Document Submission")
fc = PetriNet.Transition("FC", "Fraud Check")
ii = PetriNet.Transition("II", "In-depth Investigation")
ca = PetriNet.Transition("CA", "Claim Assessment")
ap = PetriNet.Transition("AP", "Approval")
p = PetriNet.Transition("P", "Payment")
n = PetriNet.Transition("N", "Notification")
cl = PetriNet.Transition("CL", "Closure")

Add them to the net's transitions.

Then add the arcs.

For each arc, use petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source, transition, net) or add_arc_from_to(transition, target, net).

Wait, the add_arc_from_to function takes source, target, and net. So for an arc from place to transition, source is the place, target is the transition. For an arc from transition to place, source is the transition, target is the place.

So:

Add arc from p_c to CR: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_c, cr, net)

Add arc from cr to p_cr_done: add_arc_from_to(cr, p_cr_done, net)

Then p_cr_done to dv: add_arc_from_to(p_cr_done, dv, net)

dv to p_dv_done: add_arc_from_to(dv, p_dv_done, net)

Then from p_dv_done to rds: add_arc_from_to(p_dv_done, rds, net)

rds to p_after_rds: add_arc_from_to(rds, p_after_rds, net)

p_after_rds to dv: add_arc_from_to(p_after_rds, dv, net)

Then from p_dv_done to fc: add_arc_from_to(p_dv_done, fc, net)

fc to p_fraud_check_done: add_arc_from_to(fc, p_fraud_check_done, net)

p_fraud_check_done to ii: add_arc_from_to(p_fraud_check_done, ii, net)

ii to p_after_ii: add_arc_from_to(ii, p_after_ii, net)

p_after_ii to fc: add_arc_from_to(p_after_ii, fc, net)

Then p_fraud_check_done to ca: add_arc_from_to(p_fraud_check_done, ca, net)

ca to p_ca_done: add_arc_from_to(ca, p_ca_done, net)

Now, from p_ca_done to ap and to p.

So add_arc_from_to(p_ca_done, ap, net)

add_arc_from_to(p_ca_done, p, net)

ap to p_approval_done: add_arc_from_to(ap, p_approval_done, net)

p_approval_done to p: add_arc_from_to(p_approval_done, p, net)

Then p to p_payment_done: add_arc_from_to(p, p_payment_done, net)

p_payment_done to n: add_arc_from_to(p_payment_done, n, net)

n to p_notification_done: add_arc_from_to(n, p_notification_done, net)

p_notification_done to cl: add_arc_from_to(p_notification_done, cl, net)

cl to p_closure: add_arc_from_to(cl, p_closure, net)

Wait, but for the transition P, there are two incoming arcs: one from ap (approval done) and one from p_ca_done (if no approval needed). Similarly, the transition P has an arc from p_ca_done and from p_approval_done.

But in the code above, we added:

from p_ca_done to p (the transition P), and from p_approval_done to p.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, initial marking is a token in p_c.

im = Marking()
im[p_c] = 1

Final marking is a token in p_closure.

fm = Marking()
fm[p_closure] = 1

So putting all together.

Now, check if all transitions and places are added.

But also, need to add all the places and transitions to the net.

Wait, in the code, after creating each place, need to add them to net.places. Same for transitions.

So for example:

net.places.add(p_c)
net.places.add(p_cr_done)
... and so on for all places.

Same for transitions:

net.transitions.add(cr)
net.transitions.add(dv)
... etc.

So that's important. Otherwise, the Petri net won't have those elements.

So in code:

After creating each place, add to net.places.

Same for transitions.

Now, let me write the code step by step.

Importing:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

Then:

net = PetriNet("InsuranceClaimProcess")

Creating places:

p_c = PetriNet.Place("p_c")
net.places.add(p_c)
p_cr_done = PetriNet.Place("p_cr_done")
net.places.add(p_cr_done)
p_dv_done = PetriNet.Place("p_dv_done")
net.places.add(p_dv_done)
p_after_rds = PetriNet.Place("p_after_rds")
net.places.add(p_after_rds)
p_fraud_check_done = PetriNet.Place("p_fraud_check_done")
net.places.add(p_fraud_check_done)
p_after_ii = PetriNet.Place("p_after_ii")
net.places.add(p_after_ii)
p_ca_done = PetriNet.Place("p_ca_done")
net.places.add(p_ca_done)
p_approval_done = PetriNet.Place("p_approval_done")
net.places.add(p_approval_done)
p_payment_done = PetriNet.Place("p_payment_done")
net.places.add(p_payment_done)
p_notification_done = PetriNet.Place("p_notification_done")
net.places.add(p_notification_done)
p_closure = PetriNet.Place("p_closure")
net.places.add(p_closure)

Creating transitions:

cr = PetriNet.Transition("CR", "Claim Registration")
net.transitions.add(cr)
dv = PetriNet.Transition("DV", "Document Verification")
net.transitions.add(dv)
rds = PetriNet.Transition("RDS", "Re-Document Submission")
net.transitions.add(rds)
fc = PetriNet.Transition("FC", "Fraud Check")
net.transitions.add(fc)
ii = PetriNet.Transition("II", "In-depth Investigation")
net.transitions.add(ii)
ca = PetriNet.Transition("CA", "Claim Assessment")
net.transitions.add(ca)
ap = PetriNet.Transition("AP", "Approval")
net.transitions.add(ap)
p_trans = PetriNet.Transition("P", "Payment")
net.transitions.add(p_trans)
n = PetriNet.Transition("N", "Notification")
net.transitions.add(n)
cl = PetriNet.Transition("CL", "Closure")
net.transitions.add(cl)

Note: I used p_trans for the Payment transition because 'p' is a keyword in Python? Or maybe not. Wait, in the code, the variable for Payment transition is 'p', but in Python, variables can be named 'p'. However, in the example code given in the prompt, they used 'execute_activity' as a variable. So perhaps I can name the transition variable as 'p', but maybe it's better to use a different name to avoid confusion. Wait, in the scenario, the Payment is labeled as 'P', so the transition's label is 'Payment', and the variable can be named 'p_trans' to avoid conflict. However, in the code above, when adding arcs, I have to use the variable. Let me adjust the code.

Wait, in the code for transitions:

p = PetriNet.Transition("P", "Payment")

But in Python, variables can't be named 'P' if it's a variable. Wait, no, variables can be named 'P'. For example, in the example code, they have 'execute_activity' as a variable. So perhaps the code should have:

p = PetriNet.Transition("P", "Payment")

But in the code above, I used p_trans. Let me correct that. Let me adjust the code for transitions.

So transitions:

cr = PetriNet.Transition("CR", "Claim Registration")
dv = PetriNet.Transition("DV", "Document Verification")
rds = PetriNet.Transition("RDS", "Re-Document Submission")
fc = PetriNet.Transition("FC", "Fraud Check")
ii = PetriNet.Transition("II", "In-depth Investigation")
ca = PetriNet.Transition("CA", "Claim Assessment")
ap = PetriNet.Transition("AP", "Approval")
p = PetriNet.Transition("P", "Payment")
n = PetriNet.Transition("N", "Notification")
cl = PetriNet.Transition("CL", "Closure")

Yes, that's better. So variable names are cr, dv, rds, etc.

Now, adding the arcs.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_c, cr, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr, p_cr_done, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_cr_done, dv, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, p_dv_done, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_dv_done, rds, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds, p_after_rds, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_rds, dv, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_dv_done, fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc, p_fraud_check_done, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_fraud_check_done, ii, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii, p_after_ii, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_ii, fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_fraud_check_done, ca, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca, p_ca_done, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_ca_done, ap, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_ca_done, p, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap, p_approval_done, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_approval_done, p, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p, p_payment_done, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_payment_done, n, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n, p_notification_done, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_notification_done, cl, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cl, p_closure, net)

Now, check if all arcs are added correctly.

Yes.

Then, the initial marking is:

im = Marking()
im[p_c] = 1

Final marking:

fm = Marking()
fm[p_closure] = 1

So putting all together.

Now, check for any possible errors.

For example, after the Payment transition (p), the token goes to p_payment_done. Then to N transition, then to p_notification_done, then to CL, then to p_closure. That's correct.

The loops for DV-RDS and FC-II are modeled with the respective places and transitions.

Now, let me check if all places and transitions are added to the net.

Yes, all places are added to net.places, and all transitions to net.transitions.

Now, the code should be correct.

But in the example given in the prompt, they had a sink place that was removed. However, in our case, the final place is p_closure, which is part of the net. So no need to remove anything.

So the code should be correct.

Now, write the Python code as per the instructions.

### Explanation of the Petri Net Structure

- **Places** represent the states of the process:
  - `p_c`: Initial state where a new claim is filed.
  - `p_cr_done`, `p_dv_done`, etc., represent the state after each activity is completed.
- **Transitions** model the activities:
  - `CR`, `DV`, `RDS`, `FC`, `II`, `CA`, `AP`, `P`, `N`, and `CL` represent the process steps.
- **Arcs** define the flow between activities and their conditions:
  - Loops between `DV` and `RDS`, and between `FC` and `II`, are modeled using intermediate places to allow repeated execution.
  - After `CA`, the process can proceed to `AP` if approval is needed, or directly to `P` if not.
- **Initial marking (`im`)**: A token is placed in `p_c`, representing a new claim.
- **Final marking (`fm`)**: A token is placed in `p_closure`, representing the completed and closed claim.

This Petri net accurately models the insurance claim management process, including conditional and looping behavior, using the Petri net formalism.
