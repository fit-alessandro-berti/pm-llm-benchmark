Here are key anomalies and undesirable behaviors visible in the event log, plausible root causes, and SQL queries to investigate them further.

Anomalies observed
1) Activities executed out of prescribed order
- Case 1002: Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods occurred before Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock.
- Case 1003: Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment.
- Case 1004: Receive Payment before Issue Invoice; Confirm Shipment flagged shipment_scheduled=N, yet Ship Goods proceeded.

2) Missing or skipped steps
- Several cases appear to ship without a prior Validate Stock or Confirm Shipment in correct position.
- Some financial steps appear out of place relative to shipment, possibly implying missing or deferred checks.

3) Policy/Control violations
- Shipping before credit clearance (1002).
- Receiving payment before invoice issuance (1004) may be unusual unless it’s prepayment policy; if so, it should be explicitly marked as prepayment.
- Confirm Shipment with negative indicator (shipment_scheduled=N) followed by Ship Goods (1004), contradicting logistics control.

4) Late or post-facto confirmations
- Case 1003: Confirm Shipment after shipping suggests post-facto documentation rather than operational confirmation.

5) Resource-role mismatches or segregation of duties concerns
- Ensure only appropriate roles perform Credit Check (Finance) and shipment confirmations (Logistics). Event log shows role names that look correct but should be validated against the resources table.

Hypotheses for root causes
- System configuration allows activity submission without prerequisite status checks (missing hard controls).
- User workarounds due to SLAs/expedite requests (shipping early to meet deadlines).
- Training gaps on process order or UI design that doesn’t enforce sequence.
- Integration delays between systems (e.g., WMS confirms shipment later than shipping).
- Exceptional business policies (prepayment orders) not clearly flagged or inconsistently captured.
- Data entry errors or back-dated entries when catching up on documentation.

SQL investigations

A) Detect cases with out-of-order execution relative to the canonical flow
Canonical order index:
1 Register Order
2 Perform Credit Check
3 Validate Stock
4 Confirm Shipment
5 Ship Goods
6 Issue Invoice
7 Receive Payment

1) List cases where any activity violates canonical order by timestamp
WITH canon AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM (VALUES
    ('Register Order',1),
    ('Perform Credit Check',2),
    ('Validate Stock',3),
    ('Confirm Shipment',4),
    ('Ship Goods',5),
    ('Issue Invoice',6),
    ('Receive Payment',7)
  ) v(activity, idx)
),
e AS (
  SELECT oel.case_id, oel.event_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, c.idx
  FROM order_event_log oel
  JOIN canon c ON c.activity = oel.activity
)
SELECT a.case_id,
       a.activity AS earlier_activity,
       a.timestamp AS earlier_time,
       a.idx AS earlier_idx,
       b.activity AS later_activity,
       b.timestamp AS later_time,
       b.idx AS later_idx
FROM e a
JOIN e b
  ON a.case_id = b.case_id
 AND a.timestamp > b.timestamp
 AND a.idx < b.idx
ORDER BY a.case_id, a.timestamp;

2) Count and rank frequency of out-of-order patterns
WITH canon AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM (VALUES
    ('Register Order',1),
    ('Perform Credit Check',2),
    ('Validate Stock',3),
    ('Confirm Shipment',4),
    ('Ship Goods',5),
    ('Issue Invoice',6),
    ('Receive Payment',7)
  ) v(activity, idx)
),
e AS (
  SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, c.idx
  FROM order_event_log oel
  JOIN canon c ON c.activity = oel.activity
),
violations AS (
  SELECT a.case_id, b.activity AS expected_before, a.activity AS happened_after
  FROM e a
  JOIN e b
    ON a.case_id = b.case_id
   AND a.timestamp < b.timestamp
   AND a.idx > b.idx
)
SELECT expected_before, happened_after, COUNT(*) AS violation_count
FROM violations
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY violation_count DESC;

B) Shipping before credit check or stock validation
1) Cases where Ship Goods precedes Perform Credit Check
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) AS credit_time
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM steps
WHERE ship_time IS NOT NULL
  AND (credit_time IS NULL OR ship_time < credit_time);

2) Cases where Ship Goods precedes Validate Stock
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) AS stock_time
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM steps
WHERE ship_time IS NOT NULL
  AND (stock_time IS NULL OR ship_time < stock_time);

C) Confirm Shipment issues
1) Confirm Shipment after Ship Goods
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Confirm Shipment' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_time
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM steps
WHERE ship_time IS NOT NULL
  AND confirm_time IS NOT NULL
  AND confirm_time > ship_time;

2) Confirm Shipment indicates negative status but shipment proceeds
SELECT oel.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT CASE
           WHEN oel.additional_info ILIKE '%shipment_scheduled=N%' THEN true
           ELSE false
         END AS scheduled_no
) f ON true
WHERE oel.activity='Confirm Shipment'
  AND f.scheduled_no
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log s
    WHERE s.case_id=oel.case_id
      AND s.activity='Ship Goods'
      AND s.timestamp >= oel.timestamp
);

D) Financial sequencing anomalies
1) Receive Payment before Issue Invoice
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS pay_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS inv_time
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM steps
WHERE pay_time IS NOT NULL
  AND (inv_time IS NULL OR pay_time < inv_time);

2) Payments that look like prepayments relative to shipment
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS pay_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_time
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM steps
WHERE pay_time IS NOT NULL
  AND ship_time IS NOT NULL
  AND pay_time < ship_time;

E) Resource-role/department validation for activities
1) Check if activities are done by expected departments
WITH expected AS (
  SELECT 'Register Order' AS activity, 'Sales' AS dept UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Perform Credit Check','Finance' UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Validate Stock','Logistics' UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Confirm Shipment','Logistics' UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Ship Goods','Logistics' UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Issue Invoice','Finance' UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Receive Payment','Finance'
)
SELECT oel.case_id, oel.event_id, oel.activity, oel.resource, r.department, e.dept AS expected_department
FROM order_event_log oel
LEFT JOIN resources r ON r.resource_id = oel.resource
LEFT JOIN expected e ON e.activity = oel.activity
WHERE r.department IS DISTINCT FROM e.dept
ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.event_id;

2) Segregation of duties: same resource performing conflicting steps in same case
SELECT oel.case_id, oel.resource,
       STRING_AGG(DISTINCT oel.activity, ', ' ORDER BY oel.activity) AS activities_by_resource,
       COUNT(DISTINCT oel.activity) AS activity_count
FROM order_event_log oel
GROUP BY oel.case_id, oel.resource
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT oel.activity) > 1
ORDER BY activity_count DESC, oel.case_id;

F) Link anomalies to order attributes for risk profiling
1) Are priority orders more likely to have early shipments?
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) AS credit_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) AS stock_time
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
flags AS (
  SELECT s.case_id,
         (ship_time IS NOT NULL AND (credit_time IS NULL OR ship_time < credit_time)) AS shipped_before_credit,
         (ship_time IS NOT NULL AND (stock_time IS NULL OR ship_time < stock_time)) AS shipped_before_stock
  FROM steps s
)
SELECT o.order_type,
       COUNT(*) AS cases,
       SUM(CASE WHEN shipped_before_credit THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS early_ship_vs_credit,
       SUM(CASE WHEN shipped_before_stock THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS early_ship_vs_stock
FROM flags f
JOIN orders o ON o.case_id=f.case_id
GROUP BY o.order_type;

2) Correlate credit score and early shipping (parse simple key=value from additional_info)
WITH credit AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(timestamp) AS credit_time,
         MIN(
           NULLIF(regexp_replace(additional_info, '.*credit_score=([0-9]+).*', '\1'), additional_info)
         )::INT AS credit_score
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity='Perform Credit Check'
  GROUP BY case_id
),
ship AS (
  SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) AS ship_time
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity='Ship Goods'
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT o.case_id, o.order_type, o.order_value, c.credit_score,
       ship.ship_time, c.credit_time,
       CASE WHEN ship.ship_time IS NOT NULL AND (c.credit_time IS NULL OR ship.ship_time < c.credit_time)
            THEN true ELSE false END AS shipped_before_credit_check
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN credit c ON c.case_id=o.case_id
LEFT JOIN ship ON ship.case_id=o.case_id
ORDER BY shipped_before_credit_check DESC, o.case_id;

G) Detect missing mandatory steps per case
SELECT o.case_id,
       BOOL_OR(activity='Register Order') AS has_register,
       BOOL_OR(activity='Perform Credit Check') AS has_credit_check,
       BOOL_OR(activity='Validate Stock') AS has_validate_stock,
       BOOL_OR(activity='Confirm Shipment') AS has_confirm_shipment,
       BOOL_OR(activity='Ship Goods') AS has_ship_goods,
       BOOL_OR(activity='Issue Invoice') AS has_issue_invoice,
       BOOL_OR(activity='Receive Payment') AS has_receive_payment
FROM order_event_log oel
RIGHT JOIN orders o ON o.case_id=oel.case_id
GROUP BY o.case_id
HAVING NOT (BOOL_AND(TRUE)); -- returns rows; refine in WHERE clause to highlight missing steps

Refined version to return only cases missing at least one step:
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT o.case_id,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Register Order') AS has_register,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Perform Credit Check') AS has_credit_check,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Validate Stock') AS has_validate_stock,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Confirm Shipment') AS has_confirm_shipment,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Ship Goods') AS has_ship_goods,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Issue Invoice') AS has_issue_invoice,
         BOOL_OR(activity='Receive Payment') AS has_receive_payment
  FROM orders o
  LEFT JOIN order_event_log oel ON o.case_id=oel.case_id
  GROUP BY o.case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM steps
WHERE NOT (has_register AND has_credit_check AND has_validate_stock AND has_confirm_shipment
           AND has_ship_goods AND has_issue_invoice AND has_receive_payment);

H) Lead times and latency patterns to spot operational bottlenecks or rushed flows
SELECT case_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Register Order' THEN timestamp END) AS t_register,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) AS t_credit,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) AS t_stock,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Confirm Shipment' THEN timestamp END) AS t_confirm,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS t_ship,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS t_invoice,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS t_pay
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id;

I) Check for backdating or same-timestamp anomalies (if present)
SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id, activity, timestamp
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY cnt DESC;

Recommended next steps
- Validate whether prepayment and expedited shipping are allowed and ensure they’re flagged in data (e.g., additional_info prepayment=Y, expedite=Y).
- Implement system controls to prevent shipment before credit and stock checks unless explicit exception flags exist and approvals are logged.
- Adjust UI/workflow to enforce sequence or require justification for out-of-order steps.
- Train users on correct sequencing and documentation timing.
- Add automated alerts for Confirm Shipment = N followed by Ship Goods.
