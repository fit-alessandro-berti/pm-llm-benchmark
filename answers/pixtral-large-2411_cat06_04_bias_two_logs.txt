Upon examining the event logs for Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group), we can identify biases that manifest due to the influence of the LocalResident and CommunityGroup attributes, as well as the ScoreAdjustment column. Here’s a detailed analysis:

### Data Overview

**Group A (Protected Group):**
- **LocalResident:** FALSE
- **CommunityGroup:** None
- **ScoreAdjustment:** 0

**Group B (Unprotected Group):**
- **LocalResident:** TRUE
- **CommunityGroup:** Highland Civic Darts Club (for some cases)
- **ScoreAdjustment:** +10 (Community Boost for some cases)

### Bias Analysis

#### 1. **LocalResident Attribute:**
In Group B, all applicants are local residents (TRUE), while in Group A, all applicants are non-local residents (FALSE). Local residents in Group B receive preferential treatment in terms of score adjustments if they belong to a community group.

#### 2. **CommunityGroup Attribute:**
- **Group A:** No applicants belong to any community group, hence no score adjustments are applied.
- **Group B:** Some applicants belong to the Highland Civic Darts Club, which results in a +10 score adjustment (Community Boost).

#### 3. **ScoreAdjustment Column:**
The ScoreAdjustment column is a clear indicator of bias. In Group B, applicants who belong to the Highland Civic Darts Club receive a +10 boost to their preliminary scores. This score adjustment can significantly influence the final decision.

### Manifestation of Bias

#### Case Examples:

1. **Case U001 vs. Case P001:**
   - Both have a preliminary score of 720.
   - U001 (Group B) receives a +10 community boost, resulting in an adjusted score of 730 and an "Approved" decision.
   - P001 (Group A) does not receive any adjustment and is also "Approved," but the scoring process shows bias in favor of U001 due to the boost.

2. **Case U003 vs. Case P002:**
   - U003 (Group B) has a preliminary score of 695, which, after a +10 community boost, becomes 705 and results in an "Approved" decision.
   - P002 (Group A) has a preliminary score of 710 and is "Rejected."
   - The score adjustment in Group B effectively changes the outcome from a likely rejection to an approval, highlighting the bias.

3. **Case U002 vs. Case P002:**
   - Both have a preliminary score of 710.
   - U002 (Group B) does not receive any score adjustment and is "Rejected."
   - P002 (Group A) is also "Rejected."
   - This example shows that without the community boost, outcomes are similar, reinforcing that the boost is a biasing factor.

### Conclusion

The event log for Group B exhibits clear bias due to the preferential treatment given to local residents who are members of the Highland Civic Darts Club. The +10 score adjustment (Community Boost) systematically elevates their scores, leading to more favorable final decisions compared to Group A, where no such adjustments are made. This bias manifests in the higher likelihood of approval for Group B members who receive the community boost, as opposed to Group A members who do not receive any adjustments. This systematic difference in treatment based on group membership and residency status is a form of unfair advantage and bias.
