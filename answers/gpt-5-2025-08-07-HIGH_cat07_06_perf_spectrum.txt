- What it is: A time-based flow plot of a process with three activities on the yaxis: Send Fine (top), Insert Fine Notification (middle), and Send for Credit Collection (bottom). The xaxis is calendar time from 2000 to 2013.

- How to read it: Each line links the time of an Insert Fine Notification to the time the next activity occurs.
  - Upward grey lines to Send Fine are almost perfectly vertical, meaning the fine is sent essentially at the same time the notification is inserted. They occur continuously across the whole period.
  - Downward pink/red lines to Send for Credit Collection are diagonal; the slope encodes the waiting time from the notification to the collection step. The many “fan/triangle” shapes that converge on single dates show that cases are sent to credit collection in large batches, drawing from notifications issued over long preceding periods.

- Takeaway: Sending the fine is immediate and ubiquitous; escalation to credit collection happens later and in bursts, with widely varying delays (sometimes very long) from the original notification.
