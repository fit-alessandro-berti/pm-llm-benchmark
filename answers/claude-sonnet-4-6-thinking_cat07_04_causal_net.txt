# Visualization Description

## Main Diagram: Workflow Process Model

The left/main portion depicts a **request-handling business process** modeled as a workflow net, containing labeled activity nodes (rectangles) connected via routing places (filled black circles).

### Activities (Nodes):
| ID | Activity |
|----|----------|
| a | Register request *(start)* |
| b | Examine thoroughly |
| c | Examine casually |
| d | Check ticket |
| e | Decide |
| f | Reinitiate request |
| g | Pay compensation |
| h | Reject request |
| z | End |

### Process Flow:
1. **a** triggers a **split** leading to **b**, **c**, and **d** (examination activities)
2. Results converge at **e** (decide)
3. **e** splits into either **g** (pay compensation) or **h** (reject request), both leading to **z** (end)
4. A **loop** exists via **f** (reinitiate request) cycling back to the examination phase

## Legend (Bottom-Right Box)

The gray inset illustrates **six routing gateway types**:

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **XOR-split** | Exactly one output path chosen |
| **AND-split** | All output paths activated in parallel |
| **OR-split** | One or more paths activated |
| **XOR-join** | First arriving input proceeds |
| **AND-join** | All inputs must synchronize |
| **OR-join** | Waits for all active inputs |

This is consistent with **workflow modeling notation** (e.g., WF-nets or YAWL).
