The visualization depicts **a process-oriented workflow for lab visits and lab tests** using *p-calculus (proclét classes and channels)* and includes three subparts:

### (a) Two proctlet classes connected through two channels
- The diagram shows two main processes:
  - **Lab Visit Process** (on the left)  
    Involves multiple roles such as doctor, lab assistant, and patient. Key steps include:
    1. Order entry
    2. Blood sample collection
    3. Result judgment
    4. Possible retest if results are unsatisfactory
    5. Final report sending
  - **Lab Test Process** (on the right)  
    Involves chemical analysts conducting tests and producing reports. Key steps include:
    1. Perform test
    2. Make report
    3. Possibly perform additional tests again
    4. Provide updated results
    5. Finish lab test

- **Channels between them:**
  - **Order system**: Transmits test orders from Lab Visit to Lab Test  
  - **HIS (Hospital Information System)**: Transmits results and updated reports back and forth.

- The flow follows a loop where unsatisfactory results may trigger repeat tests.

### (b) Class diagram containing the two proctlet classes
- A UML-like class diagram shows:
  - **Lab visit** requires **Lab test**.
  - Multiplicity:
    - One lab visit (1..1) requires one or many lab tests (1..*).
    - A lab test is always linked to exactly one lab visit.

---

### (c) Example of a performative (message instance)
- Provides a **message table** explaining an instance of system communication:
  - **Time**: 11:00  
  - **Channel**: Order system  
  - **Sender**: Lab visit – John  
  - **Receivers**: Lab test – HGB John  
  - **Action**: Create  
  - **Content**: "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"  
  - **Scope**: Private  
  - **Direction**: OUT

### Summary
The visualization models the **interaction between patient lab visits and laboratory test processes** using process channels.  
- (a) shows detailed workflow steps and communication pathways,  
- (b) outlines the class relationship between Lab Visit and Lab Test, and  
- (c) gives an example of a message transaction (performative) in this communication system.  

Would you like me to also **narratively walk through an end-to-end scenario** (from doctor’s order to sending final report) in plain words using this diagram?
