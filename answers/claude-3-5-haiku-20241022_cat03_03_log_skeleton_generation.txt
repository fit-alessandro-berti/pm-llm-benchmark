Here's a comprehensive Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process with carefully considered constraints:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),  # No strict equivalence requirements
    
    'always_before': {
        ('RI', 'RO'),     # Cannot reserve items before receiving order
        ('PI', 'CA'),     # Cannot pick items before checking availability
        ('PO', 'PI'),     # Cannot pack before picking
        ('GSL', 'PO'),    # Cannot generate shipping label before packing
        ('D', 'GSL'),     # Cannot dispatch before generating shipping label
        ('IC', 'RP'),     # Cannot invoice before recording payment
    },
    
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),     # Check availability must follow order receipt
        ('CA', 'RI'),     # Reservation follows availability check
        ('RI', 'PI'),     # Picking follows reservation
        ('PI', 'QC'),     # Quality check follows picking
        ('QC', 'PO'),     # Packing follows quality check
        ('PO', 'GSL'),    # Shipping label follows packing
        ('GSL', 'D'),     # Dispatch follows label generation
        ('D', 'IC'),      # Invoicing follows dispatch
        ('IC', 'RP'),     # Payment recording follows invoicing
    },
    
    'never_together': {
        ('RI', 'CA'),     # Cannot be reserving and checking simultaneously
        ('PI', 'CA'),     # Cannot be picking and checking simultaneously
        ('PO', 'PI'),     # Cannot be packing and picking simultaneously
        ('D', 'PO'),      # Cannot be dispatching and packing simultaneously
    },
    
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},        # Order receipt happens exactly once
        'CA': {1},        # Availability check happens exactly once
        'RI': {1},        # Reservation happens exactly once
        'PI': {1},        # Picking happens exactly once
        'QC': {1},        # Quality check happens exactly once
        'PO': {1},        # Packing happens exactly once
        'GSL': {1},       # Label generation happens exactly once
        'D': {1},         # Dispatch happens exactly once
        'IC': {1},        # Invoicing happens exactly once
        'RP': {1},        # Payment recording happens exactly once
    },
    
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP'),
    }
}
```

Key design considerations:

1. **Always Before** ensures logical prerequisite activities occur before subsequent ones.

2. **Always After** defines the strict sequential progression of activities.

3. **Never Together** prevents concurrent activities that logically cannot happen simultaneously.

4. **Activity Occurrences** specifies that each activity happens exactly once, reflecting a standard, linear order fulfillment process.

5. **Directly Follows** captures the precise sequential flow of the process.

This Log Skeleton captures the essential constraints and typical workflow of an order fulfillment process, ensuring a structured and logical progression of activities.

The constraints prevent scenarios like:
- Reserving items before receiving an order
- Picking items before checking availability
- Dispatching before generating a shipping label
- Multiple executions of the same activity
