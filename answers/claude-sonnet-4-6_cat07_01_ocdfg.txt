# Process Flow Visualization Description

## Overview
This is a **multi-process workflow diagram** (likely an Object-Centric Process Mining visualization) showing interconnected business processes with performance metrics (timing and object counts).

---

## Data Sources (Top Level)
Five object types feed into the processes:
| Object Type | Volume |
|---|---|
| PurchaseRequisitionItem | 2.0M objects |
| SalesOrderItem | 3.5M objects |
| PurchaseOrderItem | 5.0M objects |
| VendorInvoiceItem | 1.2M objects |
| ReturnOrderItem | 0.8M objects |

## Main Process Flows (by color)

###  Purple — Purchase Requisition Flow
**Start  Create Requisition (3.0M)  Approve Requisition (5.7M)  Send Order (5.2M)  End**

###  Blue — Purchase Order / Sales Order Flow
**Start  Create Order (8.5M)  Pack Goods (2.0M)  Ship Goods (1.8M)  Confirm Delivery (1.7M)  Close Order (1.7M)  End**

###  Orange — Sales/Vendor Flow
**Flows through Create Order  fulfillment steps  Close Order  End**

###  Green — Vendor Invoice Flow
**Start  Approve Requisition  Approve Payment (1.5M)  Create Invoice (2.0M)  End**

###  Red — Return Order Flow
**Start  Approve Requisition  Process Return (0.8M)  Confirm Delivery  End**

## Key Activity Nodes & Metrics
- **Approve Requisition**: 5.7M overall (convergence point)
- **Create Order**: 8.5M overall (highest volume)
- **Send Order**: 5.2M
- **Create Invoice**: 2.0M
- **Approve Payment**: 1.5M

## Performance Indicators
Edge labels show **processing times** ranging from **10ms to 800ms**, indicating bottlenecks (e.g., 800ms before Approve Payment).
