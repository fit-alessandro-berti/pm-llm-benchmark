To represent the complex event log in a POWL model, we need to capture the activities, choices, loops, and the partial order of the process. Here is the POWL structure that captures the relationships based on the provided event log:

### Activities:
- OR: Order Received
- MS: Material Sourcing
- QS: Quality Screening
- AS: Assembly
- IQC: In-line Quality Check
- TST: Testing
- RT: Re-Testing
- PK: Packaging
- LB: Labeling (optional)
- DP: Distribution Planning
- D: Dispatch

### CHOICE (XOR):
- Labeling (LB) is optional, so we use a choice between LB and a silent transition (tau).

### LOOP:
- IQC and AS can repeat until the test (TST) is passed.
- TST can loop back to RT if the test fails.

### Partial Order (StrictPartialOrder):
- OR must be completed before MS.
- MS must be completed before QS.
- QS must be completed before AS.
- AS can repeat with IQC.
- After the loop of AS and IQC, TST is performed.
- TST can loop back to RT if the test fails.
- After the test (TST), PK is performed.
- PK can be followed by LB (optional) and then DP.
- DP is followed by D.

### POWL Model:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define loops
loop_AS_IQC = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])
loop_TST_RT = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Define choices
choice_LB = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

# Define the partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT, PK, choice_LB, DP, D])
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, loop_AS_IQC)
root.order.add_edge(loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT)
root.order.add_edge(loop_TST_RT, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, choice_LB)
root.order.add_edge(choice_LB, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

### Explanation:
- **OR -> MS -> QS -> loop_AS_IQC**: The initial activities are ordered sequentially.
- **loop_AS_IQC**: A loop between AS and IQC, meaning AS can repeat with IQC.
- **loop_AS_IQC -> loop_TST_RT**: After the loop of AS and IQC, TST is performed, and if the test fails, it loops back to RT.
- **loop_TST_RT -> PK**: After the test (TST), PK is performed.
- **PK -> choice_LB**: PK can be followed by an optional LB (choice between LB and a silent transition).
- **choice_LB -> DP**: After (optionally) LB, DP is performed.
- **DP -> D**: DP is followed by D.

This POWL model captures the complex process with the given activities, choices, loops, and partial orders.
