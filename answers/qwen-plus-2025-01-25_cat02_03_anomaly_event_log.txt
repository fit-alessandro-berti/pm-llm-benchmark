To identify anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process, we will analyze each case and compare its sequence of activities against the standard P2P flow. The typical P2P process involves the following logical order:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Issue Purchase Order**
4. **Receive Goods**
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**
7. **Release Payment**
8. **Close Case**

Any deviation from this sequence may indicate an anomaly. Below is a detailed analysis of each case.

### **Case 1001**
- Sequence:
  1. Create Purchase Requisition
  2. Approve Purchase Requisition
  3. Issue Purchase Order
  4. Receive Goods
  5. Vendor Invoice Received
  6. Match Invoice to PO
  7. Release Payment
  8. Close Case

**Analysis:**  
The sequence follows the standard P2P process flow. No anomalies detected.

### **Case 1002**
- Sequence:
  1. Create Purchase Requisition
  2. Issue Purchase Order
  3. Vendor Invoice Received
  4. Release Payment
  5. Approve Purchase Requisition
  6. Receive Goods
  7. Match Invoice to PO
  8. Close Case

**Anomalies:**
1. **"Issue Purchase Order" before "Approve Purchase Requisition":**  
   A purchase order should not be issued until the purchase requisition is approved. Issuing a purchase order prematurely could lead to unauthorized spending or financial risks.
   
2. **"Release Payment" before "Approve Purchase Requisition":**  
   Releasing payment without proper approval of the requisition violates internal controls and increases the risk of fraud or incorrect payments.

3. **"Release Payment" before "Receive Goods":**  
   Payments are typically made after goods have been received and matched to the invoice. Paying before receiving goods can expose the organization to financial losses if the goods are not delivered as expected.

**Conclusion:**  
Case 1002 contains multiple anomalies that violate standard P2P practices and internal controls. These deviations pose significant risks to the organization.

### **Case 1003**
- Sequence:
  1. Create Purchase Requisition
  2. Approve Purchase Requisition
  3. Issue Purchase Order
  4. Release Payment
  5. Vendor Invoice Received
  6. Receive Goods
  7. Match Invoice to PO
  8. Close Case

**Anomalies:**
1. **"Release Payment" before "Vendor Invoice Received":**  
   Payments should only be released after receiving and verifying the vendor's invoice. Paying without an invoice increases the risk of overpayment or incorrect payments.

2. **"Release Payment" before "Receive Goods":**  
   Similar to Case 1002, releasing payment before receiving goods exposes the organization to financial risks.

**Conclusion:**  
Case 1003 contains two anomalies related to premature payment. These issues undermine financial controls and could result in unnecessary costs or disputes with vendors.

### **Case 1004**
- Sequence:
  1. Create Purchase Requisition
  2. Approve Purchase Requisition
  3. Receive Goods
  4. Issue Purchase Order
  5. Vendor Invoice Received
  6. Match Invoice to PO
  7. Release Payment
  8. Close Case

**Anomalies:**
1. **"Receive Goods" before "Issue Purchase Order":**  
   Goods should not be received until a purchase order has been issued. This suggests either improper record-keeping or a lack of formalized procurement processes. It also raises concerns about whether the goods were ordered through legitimate channels.

**Conclusion:**  
Case 1004 contains one anomaly where goods were received before issuing a purchase order. This deviation could indicate poor process adherence or potential irregularities in procurement practices.

| Case ID | Anomalies                                                                                     |

| 1002    | - Issue Purchase Order before Approve Purchase Requisition<br>- Release Payment prematurely    |
| 1003    | - Release Payment before Vendor Invoice Received<br>- Release Payment before Receive Goods     |
| 1004    | - Receive Goods before Issue Purchase Order                                                   |

### **Why Are These Anomalies Problematic?**
1. **Financial Risks:**  
   Premature payments (Cases 1002 and 1003) expose the organization to financial losses due to overpayments, incorrect payments, or payments for undelivered goods.

2. **Lack of Internal Controls:**  
   Skipping critical steps like approving purchase requisitions (Case 1002) undermines internal controls and increases the risk of fraud or unauthorized spending.

3. **Operational Inefficiencies:**  
   Receiving goods without issuing a purchase order (Case 1004) creates confusion in inventory management and procurement processes, potentially leading to duplicate orders or misplaced goods.

4. **Compliance Issues:**  
   Deviations from standard P2P processes may result in non-compliance with organizational policies, industry regulations, or auditing requirements.

---

### **Recommendations**
1. Conduct root cause analysis to determine why these anomalies occurred.
2. Strengthen internal controls by enforcing mandatory approvals at key stages (e.g., purchase requisition approval before issuing a purchase order).
3. Implement automated checks in the system to prevent premature payments or out-of-sequence activities.
4. Provide training to employees on the importance of adhering to the standard P2P process flow.

By addressing these anomalies, the organization can improve process efficiency, reduce financial risks, and enhance compliance with best practices.
