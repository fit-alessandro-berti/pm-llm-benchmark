## Explanation

**Case Identification Logic:**

I grouped events into cases based on application context and temporal proximity.  A new case begins when the user switches applications (e.g., from Word to Chrome). The case ends when the user closes the primary document (e.g., closing the Word document). Each case represents the completion of a specific task related to the "Quarterly Report."

Specifically, the process appears to follow this flow:
1. Start: Open the Quarterly Report document in Word
2. Edit the report (typing, saving)
3. Switch to email (to send the document)
4. Open the email, reply, and send
5. Switch to a PDF document (perhaps a supporting document)
6. Review the PDF document
7. Switch to Excel (perhaps to analyze financial figures)
8. Modify the Excel sheet
9. Switch back to Word to incorporate changes from Excel
10. Finalize and save the report.



**Activity Name Determination:**

I transformed the raw action verbs (e.g., "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SAVE," "SWITCH") into more descriptive and standardized activity names. The following mappings were used:

*   **FOCUS**:  Translated to "Edit Report" or "Type" depending on the context
*   **TYPING**:  Translated to "Type" or "Type Excel"
*   **SAVE**: Translated to "Save Report" or "Save Excel"
*   **SWITCH**: Translated to "Switch to [Application Name]"
*   **CLOSE**: Translated to "Close [Application Name]"
*   **CLICK**: Translated to "Open Email" or "Reply Email"
*   **SCROLL**: Translated to "Scroll [Application Name]"
*   **HIGHLIGHT**: Translated to "Highlight [Application Name]"
*    **Add Excel Row**: Translated to "Add Excel Row"



This approach aims for clarity and consistency, enabling a process mining analyst to easily understand the steps within each case. The activity names represent high-level actions performed by the user.
