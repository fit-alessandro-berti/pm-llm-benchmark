Based on the provided constraints, I will attempt to describe the process underlying them.

The process appears to be a workflow management system, specifically for processing financial declarations. Here's an outline of the steps involved:

1. **Initialization**: The process starts with one of the activities: `"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"`.
2. **Request Payment**: The process transitions to `"Request Payment"` and then to `"Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"`, indicating that a payment is requested, and it is pending approval.
3. **Payment Handling**: After approval, the process proceeds to `"Payment Handled"` and eventually to `"Declare SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"`.
4. **Payment Processing**: Once paid, the process moves on to complete the processing, which involves multiple activities within the chain of response:
   - `"Request Payment"`
   * `"Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"`
   * `"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"`
   * `"Payment Handled"` (once paid)
5. **Approval**: Each subsequent activity in the chain represents approval or processing, ensuring a specific step is taken at each point.
6. **Co-Existence Check for Payment Handling**:
   - If any activity involving a payment has not yet occurred, then all activities following "Payment Handled" must be skipped and none should occur after this activity
7. **Precedence**:
   - Only proceed when all preceding activities have completed (in order: Employee Submission to Supervisor Approval)
8. **Succession & Chain Succession**:
   - Activities can follow in either consecutive or chained manner - if an earlier activity fails then later ones are skipped.
9. **Alternate Response**:
  - A second instance of "Payment Handled" should occur; once this happens it cannot be a success story
10. **Absence**: There are certain states where absence takes priority (if an event appears we can assume as default absence).
11. **Succession from Previous Steps**: Success or failure should lead to transition for the next step.

Please note that some rules may contain implicit dependencies due to their nature, which may imply further ordering or non-reordering depending on what steps actually need to occur
