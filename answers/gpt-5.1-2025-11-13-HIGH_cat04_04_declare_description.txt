Below is a practical reading of the DECLARE model: first as a concrete “story” of how a typical loan is handled, then as an explanation of how each constraint helps enforce that story, why those rules exist in the real world, and what can go wrong if they’re violated.

---

## 1. A realistic stepbystep process

From a customer’s perspective, one complete loan case might look like this:

1. **Receive_Application**  
   The bank receives the customer’s loan application (online form, branch visit, etc.).  
   - This is always the **first** step in the case.

2. **Preliminary_Credit_Check**  
   The bank runs an initial credit check on the applicant.  
   - This happens **exactly once** for the case.
   - It always happens **after** the application has been received.

3. **Gather_Additional_Documents**  
   If the preliminary check is acceptable, the bank requests supporting documents (ID, proof of income, bank statements, etc.) and collects them.  
   - This always happens in every case, and it happens only **after** the preliminary credit check.

4. **Quality_Assurance_Review**  
   Once the necessary documents are in, a QA or compliance officer checks that:
   - The credit check and documents are complete and consistent.
   - Regulatory requirements (KYC, AML, internal policies) are met.
   This review can be thought of as the **gatekeeper** before any final decision.

5. **Authorize_Contract_Terms**  
   Based on the credit assessment and QA review, an authorized officer (or automated system with proper controls) approves the loan terms:
   - Amount, interest rate, repayment schedule, covenants, etc.
   - This step only happens if documents have been gathered and a QA review has taken place.

6. **Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package**  
   The bank prepares the full loan offer package:
   - Legally binding contract, disclosure statements, repayment plan, fees.
   - This package reflects the terms that have been authorized and passed QA.

7. **Transfer_Funds**  
   Once the offer is ready (and in practice, after customer acceptance, which is not modeled here), the bank disburses the funds to the customer’s account.
   - In this simplified model, transferring funds follows directly from assembling the final package.

8. **Notify_Customer**  
   The customer is formally informed:
   - That the loan has been approved and funded, or what the outcome is.
   - Notifications are aligned onetoone with each transfer: every transfer leads to a notification, and each notification refers to a preceding transfer.

9. **Proceed_Without_Compliance (forbidden)**  
   This is a hypothetical activity that **must never occur**.  
   It represents bypassing mandatory checks (e.g., granting a loan without credit check, KYC, or required approvals).

So, in short, a typical, compliant trace is:

> Receive_Application  Preliminary_Credit_Check  Gather_Additional_Documents  Quality_Assurance_Review  Authorize_Contract_Terms  Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer

## 2. How each DECLARE constraint shapes the process

### A. Ensuring minimum and initial steps

1. **`init(Receive_Application)`**  
   - Guarantees the process always **starts** with receiving the application.  
   - Prevents strange traces where, for example, funds are transferred without any application in that case.

2. **`existence(Receive_Application)`**  
   - The application must occur at least once in each case; you can’t have a loan process without an application.

3. **`existence(Gather_Additional_Documents)`**  
   - Every case must include document collection.  
   - This enforces that approvals are not based solely on a credit score without supporting evidence (pay stubs, IDs, etc.).

4. **`exactly_one(Preliminary_Credit_Check)`**  
   - There is exactly one preliminary credit check per case.  
   - This avoids:
     - Multiple, inconsistent credit assessments in one case.
     - “Shopping around” internally for a better score by rerunning checks until something favorable appears.

**Realworld rationale:**  
These rules reflect basic operational sanity and auditability. Every loan must have a traceable start and must include at least one documented credit assessment and document collection.

---

### B. Enforcing the early decision flow: application  credit check  documents

5. **`response(Receive_Application  Preliminary_Credit_Check)`**  
   - Once an application is received, a preliminary credit check **must eventually follow**.  
   - Ensures that every application is evaluated; none is left in limbo or handled purely by manual judgment.

6. **`succession(Preliminary_Credit_Check  Gather_Additional_Documents)`**  
   Succession combines “response” (A  eventually B) and “precedence” (B implies A happened before):
   - After a **Preliminary_Credit_Check**, **Gather_Additional_Documents** must eventually occur.  
   - If **Gather_Additional_Documents** occurs, it must be preceded by a **Preliminary_Credit_Check**.
   In practical terms:
   - You never request or process supporting documents for a case unless a credit check has been done.
   - Conversely, doing a credit check implies you will move on to collect necessary paperwork.

**Realworld rationale:**  
- **Risk management:** Preliminary scoring first; if the customer clearly fails (e.g., severely bad credit), you may not want to spend effort collecting documents.
- **Customer experience:** Avoids asking for documents when the customer is obviously ineligible.
- **Regulatory fairness:** Everyone is assessed systematically, not arbitrarily.

---

### C. Linking documents, QA, and authorization

7. **`coexistence(Gather_Additional_Documents  Authorize_Contract_Terms)`**  
   - If documents are gathered, then contract terms must be authorized at some point.  
   - If contract terms are authorized, documents must have been gathered.
   Effectively:
   - No authorization without documents.
   - No cases where documents are collected and then the case is left with no decision or authorization step.

8. **`altsuccession(Gather_Additional_Documents  Quality_Assurance_Review)`**  
   Alternate succession means:
   - After each **Gather_Additional_Documents**, a **Quality_Assurance_Review** must occur **before another** Gather_Additional_Documents.  
   - Each **Quality_Assurance_Review** is preceded by a **Gather_Additional_Documents** with no other QA in between.
   In practice:
   - Every new or updated batch of documents is followed by QA before another round of document requests.
   - QA is tightly coupled to document handling; you don’t run QA arbitrarily.

9. **`responded_existence(Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Quality_Assurance_Review)`**  
   - If the loan offer package is assembled, there must be at least one QA review in the case.  
   - Ensures that you never prepare the final offer without some form of QA having been performed.

10. **`precedence(Quality_Assurance_Review  Authorize_Contract_Terms)`**  
    - Authorization of contract terms can only occur if a QA review has taken place **before** it.  
    - QA thus acts as a **precondition** for authorization.

**Realworld rationale:**  
- **Compliance and QA:** Ensures that before final approval, an independent check confirms the case meets internal and external rules.
- **Fraud prevention:** QA can flag forged documents, unusual patterns, or manual overrides.
- **Operational best practice:** Avoids authorizing something that hasn’t been fully reviewed.

---

### D. Tight coupling of QA, offer packaging, and authorization

11. **`chainsuccession(Quality_Assurance_Review  Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package)`**  
    Chain succession strengthens succession by requiring **immediate adjacency**:
    - After a **Quality_Assurance_Review**, the very next step is assembling the loan offer package (and every assembly has a QA just before it).
    Interpretation:
    - Once QA signs off, the case moves directly into offer packaging without unrelated steps in between.
    - Every final package can be traced back to a specific QA review.

12. **`chainprecedence(Preliminary_Credit_Check  Authorize_Contract_Terms)`**  
    Chain precedence requires immediate order in the opposite direction:
    - **Authorize_Contract_Terms** can only occur immediately after a **Preliminary_Credit_Check**, or more generally: authorization cannot happen unless at least that check is directly or closely linked beforehand.  
    (In a less strict reading, this encodes “authorization must be based on the credit check.”)

**Realworld rationale:**  
- **Traceability:** Each offer package and authorization can be tied to a specific QA review and credit assessment.
- **Control:** Prevents lastminute changes or unauthorized modifications slipping in between QA and final packaging/authorization.

---

### E. From final offer to funds and customer notification

13. **`chainresponse(Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Transfer_Funds)`**  
    - Once the final loan offer package is assembled, the next key step is **Transfer_Funds**.  
    - There is no extended gap filled with conflicting alterations; the process is decisive: package  disbursement.

14. **`altresponse(Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer)`** and  
    **`altprecedence(Notify_Customer  Transfer_Funds)`**  
    Taken together, alternate response and alternate precedence enforce a **1:1 pairing**:
    - Every time funds are transferred, a **Notify_Customer** must occur afterward before any further transfer in that same case.
    - Every **Notify_Customer** must be preceded by exactly one **Transfer_Funds**, with no other notifications in between.
    Practical meaning:
    - For each disbursement (e.g., a multitranche loan), the customer gets a dedicated notification (SMS, email, letter).
    - No “orphan” notifications with no actual funds transfer.

15. **`noncoexistence(Transfer_Funds, Receive_Application)`**  
    Noncoexistence normally forbids both events in the same trace. In a practical interpretation here:
    - It expresses that **starting a new application** is not mixed into a case where funds have already been transferred; once the case has gone to payout, you don’t loop back to application in the same instance.
    - Each loan case is kept clean: one application lifecycle per case.

16. **`nonsuccession(Notify_Customer  Preliminary_Credit_Check)`**  
    - Once the customer has been notified of the outcome, **no additional preliminary credit checks** can occur afterward in that case.  
    - You don’t keep reassessing the customer’s credit after telling them the final result for that application.

17. **`nonchainsuccession(Authorize_Contract_Terms  Notify_Customer)`**  
    - The customer cannot be notified **immediately** after authorization.  
    - There must be at least one intervening step (notably, transfer of funds).  
    - This matches a business intent: “Don’t tell the customer their loan is complete until the disbursement has actually been arranged.”

**Realworld rationale:**  
- **Customer satisfaction and clarity:** Every transfer is clearly communicated; no confusing or premature messages.
- **Risk control:** Prevents continuing risk processes (credit checks) after closure and avoids telling a customer something that isn’t fully executed in the system.
- **Clean case boundaries:** A single case does not mix multiple applications or indefinite rework after payout.

---

### F. Prohibiting noncompliant behavior

18. **`absence(Proceed_Without_Compliance)`**  
    - This activity must **never** appear in any trace.  
    - It stands for “shortcutting” the defined risk, QA, or compliance checks.

**Realworld rationale:**  
- **Regulatory compliance:** Many jurisdictions require documented creditworthiness assessment, KYC, AML checks, and adequate documentation as a legal prerequisite to lending.
- **Liability and audit:** If a regulator, auditor, or court sees evidence of such a step, it indicates a serious breach.

---

## 3. What happens if rules are violated?

Some concrete consequences if activities occur out of order or mandatory steps are omitted:

1. **Transferring funds before credit check or documents**  
   - Violates the intended chain: application  credit  documents  QA  authorization  package  funds.  
   - Consequences:
     - High default risk (no proper risk assessment).
     - Potential regulatory sanctions for irresponsible lending.
     - Losses if the borrower is clearly not creditworthy.

2. **Authorizing contract terms without QA or documents**  
   - Breaks `coexistence(Gather_Documents  Authorize_Terms)` and `precedence(QA  Authorize_Terms)`.  
   - Consequences:
     - Breach of internal credit policy or legal requirements (e.g., missing income verification).
     - Increased fraud risk (forged docs not caught).
     - Serious compliance findings in audits.

3. **Skipping or duplicating the Preliminary_Credit_Check**  
   - Skipping: no foundation for the lending decision, violating regulations on creditworthiness assessment.  
   - Duplicating: inconsistent treatment of the same customer, “score shopping” internally, potentially unfair decisions and poor audit trail.

4. **Sending notifications that don’t match funds transfers**  
   - Violates the alternate succession between **Transfer_Funds** and **Notify_Customer**.  
   - Consequences:
     - Customer confusion (“You say the loan is disbursed but I see no money.”).
     - Complaints, reputational damage, potential legal exposure if communication is misleading.

5. **Continuing processing after final notification**  
   - Violates `nonsuccession(Notify_Customer  Preliminary_Credit_Check)`.  
   - Consequences:
     - Customer might receive one decision, but the bank continues altering its view of their creditworthiness, possibly leading to internal inconsistency (what is the “true” decision for that application?).

6. **Performing “Proceed_Without_Compliance”**  
   - Directly violates the `absence` constraint.  
   - Consequences:
     - Redflag event in any audit.
     - Potential regulatory fines, legal liability, and reputational harm.
     - Internally, it indicates staff are bypassing controls, which is a serious governance issue.

## 4. Summary

The DECLARE model does not prescribe one rigid, linear flow; instead, it defines a **set of rules** about:

- Which activities must appear and which must never appear.
- What must happen before or after what.
- Which activities are tightly coupled (immediately adjacent) or onetoone (like transfers and notifications).
- Where the process must not go (no continued work after final notification, no shortcuts around compliance).

Taken together, these constraints describe a loan approval process that:

- Starts cleanly with an application.
- Assesses risk systematically (credit check, documents, QA).
- Authorizes and packages the loan only after proper checks.
- Disburses funds in a controlled way.
- Communicates clearly and consistently with the customer.
- Avoids noncompliant shortcuts and postdecision rework.

This is how the abstract DECLARE constraints translate into a realistic, compliant, and auditable loan process.
