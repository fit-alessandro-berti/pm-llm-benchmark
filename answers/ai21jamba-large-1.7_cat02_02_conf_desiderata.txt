### **Analysis of Cases Based on Normative and Desiderata Constraints**

#### **Case 1**

- **Normative Compliance:**
This case strictly adheres to the required sequence of activities. No violations are observed.
	- The activities follow the correct order: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
	- Documentation is finalized only after the loan is approved.
- **Desiderata Compliance:**
	- Credit Check occurred promptly (30 minutes after the application was received).
	- The applicant was informed within a reasonable time after the loan decision (within 2 hours).
	- A Follow-up Call was not performed, but this is not a serious issue.
- **Summary for Case 1:**
Fully normative-compliant and satisfies most desiderata. It represents optimal process behavior.

#### **Case 2**

- **Normative Compliance:**
	- Violates sequence: Risk Assessment (09:00) was performed before the Credit Check (09:30).
	- Not allowed behavior: Documentation is finalized even after a loan rejection.
- **Desiderata Compliance:**
	- Credit Check happened quickly (after 30 minutes).
	- Inform Applicant was not required for a rejected case, so timing is irrelevant.
	- Skipped Follow-up Call (not critical).
- **Interpretation:**
This case suggests an error in workflow enforcement. Risk Assessment was conducted prematurely, and documentation was finalized contrary to the rules after a rejection.

#### **Case 3**

- **Normative Compliance:**
	- No sequence violations observed. The activities follow the correct order.
	- Finalization of documentation occurred only for an approved loan, which aligns with the rules.
- **Desiderata Compliance:**
	- Credit Check occurred 25 hours after the application was received, violating the 24-hour recommendation.
	- Inform Applicant occurred approximately 69 hours after the loan decision, exceeding the 48-hour recommendation.
	- No Follow-up Call was performed, though not a serious deviation.
- **Interpretation:**
The process was normative-compliant but delays in both the Credit Check and Inform Applicant activities suggest inefficiencies, possibly due to resource constraints or external factors.

### **Summarized Findings**

1. **Normative Violations:**
	- Case 2:
		- Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check.
		- Finalization of documentation after a rejected loan.
	- No normative violations in Cases 1 and 3.
2. **Desiderata Violations:**
	- Case 3:
		- Credit Check delayed (more than 24 hours after application received).
		- Inform Applicant delayed (more than 48 hours after the loan decision).
	- Case 2: No severe desiderata violations, but the order of activities and finalization after rejection highlight a flawed process.
	- All cases skipped the Follow-up Call (minor desideratum).

### **Recommendations and Justifications**

1. **For Case 2 Issues:**
	- Enforce workflow rules to prevent activities from occurring out of sequence.
	- Ensure the system enforces documentation finalization only for approved loans.
2. **For Case 3 Delays:**
	- Investigate reasons for delays in Credit Check (resource allocation, bottlenecks).
	- Implement a proactive notification system to remind applicants about decisions promptly after 48 hours.
3. **For Follow-up Call Skipping:**
	- While not critical, adding a call could enhance applicant satisfaction. Consider making this a standard but optional activity.

This analysis highlights that while most cases (1 and 3) align well with the normative process, Case 2 exhibits serious deviations, requiring immediate corrective actions. Desiderata violations in Case 3 reflect inefficiencies but do not compromise process integrity.
