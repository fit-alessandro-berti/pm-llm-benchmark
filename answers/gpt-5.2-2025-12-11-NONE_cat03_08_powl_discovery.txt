### Activities (transitions)
- `OR`, `MS`, `QS`, `AS`, `IQC`, `TST`, `RT`, `PK`, `LB`, `DP`, `D`
- `skip` = silent transition `tau` (used to model “LB may be skipped”)

---

## High-level behavior observed in the log
1. **Main linear backbone:** `OR  MS  QS  (production & checks)  (testing & possible re-testing)  PK  (LB optional)  DP  D`
2. **In-line quality check (IQC) can repeat and sends you back to assembly:** pattern `AS ( IQC AS )*` with the possibility of **no IQC at all** (case 4).
3. **Testing can repeat via re-testing:** pattern `TST ( RT TST )*` (cases 1,3,5), and also **no RT** (case 2,4).
4. **Labeling is optional:** `LB` or skip.

All of these are strictly sequential in the examples (no evidence of concurrency), so the root can be a strict sequence expressed via a partial order chain.

# Final POWL structure

### Submodels

**1) Assembly with optional/repeatable in-line QC**
- Define:
  - `A = AS`
  - `B = PO=(nodes={IQC, AS}, order={IQC-->AS})`  (i.e., when you do a “rework iteration”, you do IQC then AS)
- Loop:
  - `loop_IQC = * ( AS, PO=(nodes={IQC, AS}, order={IQC-->AS}) )`
    - Meaning: do `AS`, then either exit, or do `(IQCAS)` and repeat.
- Allow the whole IQC loop to be skipped (case 4 has AS without IQC, but still has AS; however it *does* have AS. So we should **not** skip AS entirely.)
  - This is already satisfied: `loop_IQC` always executes `AS` at least once, and may do zero IQC iterations.

So production block is simply:
- `prod = loop_IQC`

**2) Testing with optional/repeatable re-testing**
- Define:
  - `T = TST`
  - `R = PO=(nodes={RT, TST}, order={RT-->TST})`  (a retest cycle is RT then TST)
- Loop:
  - `loop_RT = * ( TST, PO=(nodes={RT, TST}, order={RT-->TST}) )`
    - Meaning: do `TST`, then either exit, or do `(RTTST)` and repeat.

So test block is:
- `test = loop_RT`

**3) Optional labeling**
- `opt_LB = X ( LB, tau )`

## Root partial order (overall process)

Let the root be:
```
PO=(
  nodes={
    OR, MS, QS,
    prod,          # loop_IQC
    test,          # loop_RT
    PK,
    opt_LB,        # X(LB, tau)
    DP, D
  },
  order={
    OR-->MS,
    MS-->QS,
    QS-->prod,
    prod-->test,
    test-->PK,
    PK-->opt_LB,
    opt_LB-->DP,
    DP-->D
  }
)
```

This POWL captures:
- mandatory upstream steps (`OR, MS, QS`)
- **repeatable** IQC-driven rework around assembly (`*(AS, (IQCAS))`)
- **repeatable** RT-driven test cycles (`*(TST, (RTTST))`)
- **optional** labeling (`X(LB, tau)`)
- final logistics (`DP  D`)
