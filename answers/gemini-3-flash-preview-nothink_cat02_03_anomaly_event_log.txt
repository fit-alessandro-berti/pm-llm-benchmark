Based on standard business practices for the **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** process, a standard workflow should follow a logical sequence: Request $\rightarrow$ Approval $\rightarrow$ Ordering $\rightarrow$ Receipt $\rightarrow$ Verification (3-way match) $\rightarrow$ Payment.

Analysis of the provided event log reveals significant anomalies in Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004.

### Case 1001: Standard Process (Baseline)
*   **Observation:** This case follows the ideal P2P path. The requisition is created and approved before the PO is issued. Goods are received and matched to the invoice before payment is released.
*   **Status:** **Normal.**

---

### Case 1002: Critical Control Failure (Post-hoc Approval)
*   **Anomalies:**
    1.  **PO Issued before PR Approval:** The Purchase Order was issued (08:40) only 10 minutes after the requisition was created, but nearly two days *before* the requisition was approved (Feb 3rd).
    2.  **Payment before Approval/Receipt:** Payment was released on Feb 3rd at 07:15, while the approval for the purchase didn't happen until 08:00 that same day, and the goods weren't received until Feb 4th.
*   **Why it is problematic:**
    *   **Financial Risk:** The company paid for goods it had not yet received.
    *   **Bypassing Controls:** Issuing a PO and paying a vendor before internal approval suggests a "Maverick Buying" scenario where internal procurement policies are ignored. This circumvents budget oversight.

### Case 1003: Pre-payment and Delayed Verification
*   **Anomalies:**
    1.  **Payment before Invoice/Receipt:** Payment was released on Feb 8th. However, the vendor invoice was not received until Feb 9th, and the goods did not arrive until Feb 10th.
    2.  **Matching after Payment:** The "Match Invoice to PO" activity occurred on Feb 11th, three days *after* the money had already left the company.
*   **Why it is problematic:**
    *   **Loss of Leverage:** Paying a vendor before receiving goods or an invoice removes any leverage the company has if the goods arrive damaged, in the wrong quantity, or never arrive at all.
    *   **Fraud/Error Risk:** Without a "3-way match" (matching the PO, Goods Receipt, and Invoice) prior to payment, the company is highly susceptible to overpaying or paying for fraudulent invoices.

---

### Case 1004: Retrospective Purchase Order
*   **Anomalies:**
    1.  **Goods Received before PO:** The goods were received on Feb 6th at 09:00, while the Purchase Order was not issued until 09:15 that same day.
*   **Why it is problematic:**
    *   **"Backfilling" Paperwork:** This is a classic "Retrospective PO." It indicates that an employee likely ordered goods (perhaps via phone or email) without using the formal system. Once the goods arrived, they realized they needed a PO number to process the paperwork and created one after the fact.
    *   **Operational Risk:** This undermines the procurement department's ability to negotiate pricing, verify the vendor's preferred status, or ensure the expense was budgeted.

### Summary Table of Anomalies

| Case ID | Primary Anomaly | Core Business Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1001** | None | N/A (Compliant) |
| **1002** | Approval after Payment | Total lack of budgetary control; Maverick buying. |
| **1003** | Payment before Receipt/Match | High risk of overpayment and loss of vendor leverage. |
| **1004** | Goods Receipt before PO | Use of retrospective POs; bypassing procurement strategy. |
