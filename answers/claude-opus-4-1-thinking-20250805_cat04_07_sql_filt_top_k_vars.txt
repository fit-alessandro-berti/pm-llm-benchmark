Here's a comprehensive DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes all the requirements:

```sql
-- Replace 'K' with the desired number of top variants (e.g., 5)
WITH case_sequences AS (
    -- Step 1: Determine the sequence of activities for each case_id
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS process_variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
    -- Step 2: Group cases by their activity sequence and count
    SELECT 
        process_variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        LIST(case_id) AS case_ids
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY process_variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
    -- Step 3: Identify the top K variants by frequency
    SELECT 
        process_variant,
        case_count,
        case_ids
    FROM variant_frequencies
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K  -- Replace K with actual number
),
cases_in_top_variants AS (
    -- Unnest the case_ids from top K variants
    SELECT UNNEST(case_ids) AS case_id
    FROM top_k_variants
)
-- Step 4: Return all events from cases belonging to top K variants
SELECT 
    el.case_id,
    el.activity,
    el.timestamp
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_in_top_variants)
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

**Alternative version with additional insights:**

```sql
-- This version also returns variant information alongside the events
WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS process_variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT 
        process_variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS variant_rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY process_variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT process_variant
    FROM variant_frequencies
    WHERE variant_rank <= K  -- Replace K with actual number
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        cs.case_id,
        cs.process_variant,
        vf.case_count,
        vf.variant_rank
    FROM case_sequences cs
    INNER JOIN variant_frequencies vf 
        ON cs.process_variant = vf.process_variant
    WHERE cs.process_variant IN (SELECT process_variant FROM top_k_variants)
)
-- Return events with variant metadata
SELECT 
    el.case_id,
    el.activity,
    el.timestamp,
    fc.process_variant,
    fc.case_count AS variant_frequency,
    fc.variant_rank
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id
ORDER BY fc.variant_rank, el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

**Key Features of the Query:**

1. **Case Sequence Extraction**: Uses `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp` to create an ordered concatenation of activities per case.

2. **Variant Identification**: Groups cases by their complete activity sequence string.

3. **Frequency Counting**: Counts how many cases follow each unique variant pattern.

4. **Top K Selection**: Orders variants by frequency and limits to top K results.

5. **Event Filtering**: Returns only the events from cases that match the top K variants.

**Usage Notes:**
- Replace `K` with the actual number of top variants you want (e.g., `LIMIT 5` for top 5 variants)
- The separator `'->'` in STRING_AGG can be modified to any preferred delimiter
- The query maintains the original event structure while filtering based on variant membership
- Consider adding indexes on `case_id` and `timestamp` columns for better performance with large datasets
