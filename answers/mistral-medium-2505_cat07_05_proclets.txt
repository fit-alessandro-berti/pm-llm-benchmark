The diagram presents a detailed overview of a process involving two main classes: Lab visit and Lab test, which are depicted in a class diagram and connected through various interactions. The primary structure includes a sequence of activities starting with a lab visit where a doctor orders a lab test, followed by a lab assistant taking a blood sample. The sample is then processed through an order system, leading to a lab test where a chemical analysis is performed, and a report is generated. The results are received and judged, potentially leading to further tests if necessary, and ultimately a report is sent. Annotations in the diagram indicate the flow and interaction between these activities, with specific channels connecting the two classes. The table at the bottom provides an example of a performative, detailing the time, channel, sender, receivers, action, content, scope, and direction of a specific communication instance. Overall, the diagram illustrates the procedural flow and interactions within a healthcare setting, emphasizing the structured communication and testing process between lab visits and lab tests.
