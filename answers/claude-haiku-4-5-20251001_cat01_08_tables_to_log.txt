# Event Log for Process Mining

## Summary of Assumptions and Transformations

1. **Case Identification**: Each `order_id` represents a unique case.
2. **Activity Derivation**:
   - "Order Created" from Orders table
   - "Item Picked" for each line item (one event per item per order)
   - "Order Dispatched" from Delivery table (dispatch_date)
   - "Order Arrived" from Delivery table (arrival_date)
   - "Invoice Issued" from Invoice table
   - "Payment Received" from Payments table
3. **Chronological Order**: Events are sorted by timestamp within each case.
4. **Resources**: Mapped from the Resources table where applicable.
5. **Missing Data**: Order 1004 has no delivery or invoice records in the provided data (assumption: process incomplete or data missing).

## Data Quality Notes

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Order 1004 - Incomplete Process** | Order 1004 has picking activity but no delivery, invoice, or payment records. This may indicate the process is still in progress, or data is missing from the source tables. |
| **Multiple Deliveries for Order 1002** | Order 1002 has two delivery records (DLV-5002 and DLV-5003) with overlapping dispatch dates. DLV-5003 was dispatched before DLV-5002 arrived, suggesting a split shipment scenario with a backorder. |
| **Resource Resolution** | All resource IDs have been mapped to their names and roles using the Resources table. |
| **Item Details** | Item descriptions and categories have been inferred from the Products table where available. |
