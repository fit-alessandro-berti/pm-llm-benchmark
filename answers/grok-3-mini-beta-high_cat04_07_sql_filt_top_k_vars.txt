<think>
First, I need to construct a DuckDB SQL query that handles an event log in a table called `event_log` with columns `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. The goal is to find the ordered sequence of activities for each case, group them into variants, count how many cases have each variant, find the top K variants by frequency, and then return all events only from cases that are part of those top K variants.

To get the ordered sequence of activities for each case, I need to sort the events by `timestamp` within each `case_id`. In SQL, I can use window functions or group by to achieve this. Since I need the sequence, I might need to concatenate the activities in order.

DuckDB supports array aggregation and string aggregation functions that can handle ordered data. I can use `STRING_AGG` or `ARRAY_AGG` with an ORDER BY clause to create a string or array that represents the sequence.

For example, I can do something like:

SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

FROM event_log

GROUP BY case_id;

This should give me each case_id and a string that concatenates the activities in the order of their timestamps.

STRING_AGG with ORDER BY should work because I can specify the order. Yes, in DuckDB, STRING_AGG can take an ORDER BY clause.

I could use ARRAY_AGG with ORDER BY to create an array of activities.

Using a string might be fine for grouping, as long as the sequence is preserved.

Now, step 2 is to group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants. So after getting the variant_seq for each case, I need to group by that variant_seq and count the number of cases.

So, I can do:

SELECT variant_seq, COUNT(*) as variant_count

FROM (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

) sub

GROUP BY variant_seq;

In the subquery, I'm grouping by case_id to get the sequence per case, then in the outer query, group by the variant_seq to count how many cases have the same sequence.

Yes.

Now, I need to find the top K variants by their frequency. So I need to order this by variant_count DESC and limit to top K.

But I need to keep track of which variants they are to filter the cases later.

Also, since variant_seq is a string, I can use it for filtering.

But in the end, I need to return the events, not just the variants.

So, after finding the top K variants, I need to find which case_ids are associated with those variants, and then select all events from those case_ids.

The variants are defined by the sequence, so I need to identify the case_ids that have a variant_seq that is among the top K.

In SQL, to do this efficiently, I might need to use a subquery or a CTE to first find the top K variants and their sequences.

Then, use that to filter the cases that have those sequences.

Then, join back to the event_log to get all events for those cases.

Since I have the variant_seq per case, I can find which cases have a variant_seq in the top K set.

But variant_seq is computed, so I need to compute it again or use a join.

Perhaps using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) would make it cleaner.

Let me sketch this out.

First, define a CTE that gets the variant sequence per case.

WITH case_variants AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

)

Then, another CTE that gets the variant counts and top K.

I need to find the top K variants.

So,

WITH case_variants AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT variant_seq, COUNT(*) as variant_count

    FROM case_variants

    GROUP BY variant_seq

),

top_k_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_seq

    FROM variant_counts

    ORDER BY variant_count DESC

    LIMIT K  -- but K is a parameter, I need to handle that.

K is not specified in the query; it's part of the task. Probably, I need to make K a parameter or assume it's given.

In the prompt, it says "top K variants", so I should use a parameter for K.

In SQL, I can use a variable or just assume it's a number, but in DuckDB, I might need to pass it as a parameter.

For the query, I can write it with a placeholder for K.

Perhaps use a CTE with ROW_NUMBER or something.

A common way is to use a subquery with LIMIT.

But LIMIT in SQL requires a constant, but in DuckDB, I think I can use a parameter.

I'll assume K is a number I can use in the query.

So, in top_k_variants, I can do:

SELECT variant_seq, variant_count,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) as rn

FROM variant_counts

Then, filter where rn <= K.

ROW_NUMBER() assigns ranks, and I can filter.

But in SQL, to use LIMIT with top K, I can directly do:

SELECT variant_seq

FROM variant_counts

ORDER BY variant_count DESC

LIMIT K;

But this gives me the top K variant_seqs, but if there are ties, it might not be stable, but for now, assume it's fine.

To handle ties properly, sometimes we use RANK or DENSE_RANK, but for simplicity, I'll use LIMIT K after ORDER BY.

Now, this top_k_variants CTE will have the variant_seq of the top K.

variant_seq might not be unique if I select only variant_seq, but since I'm grouping by variant_seq earlier, it should be unique in variant_counts.

In variant_counts, variant_seq is unique because it's grouped.

variant_counts has one row per unique variant_seq.

So top_k_variants can be:

WITH ... as before,

top_k_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_seq

    FROM variant_counts

    ORDER BY variant_count DESC

    LIMIT K

)

But in some SQL dialects, you can't use LIMIT in a CTE directly for subqueries, but DuckDB should support it.

I can use a subquery.

Now, I need to find the case_ids that have a variant_seq in this top_k_variants.

So, I can join case_variants with top_k_variants on variant_seq.

Since top_k_variants has the variant_seq, I can do:

filtered_cases AS (

    SELECT cv.case_id

    FROM case_variants cv

    JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON cv.variant_seq = tkv.variant_seq

)

Then, finally, select all events from event_log where case_id is in filtered_cases.

So,

SELECT el.*

FROM event_log el

JOIN filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id

ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp  -- probably good to order the output, but not specified.

The prompt says "Return all events from the original event log", so probably select the columns as they are.

Now, about the sequence: I used STRING_AGG, but is there a better way? What if activities have spaces or special chars? STRING_AGG might concatenate them directly, like "A,B,C" if I use a separator.

I should use a separator to avoid ambiguity.

For example, STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp)

In DuckDB, the syntax might be STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp, ',') or something.

I need to check the exact syntax for DuckDB.

Assuming it's similar to PostgreSQL, it might be STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp)

In standard SQL, STRING_AGG usually has the delimiter first, then ORDER BY.

In DuckDB, I believe it's STRING_AGG(expression, delimiter [ORDER BY ...])

Yes, probably STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

By using a comma or some delimiter, it should be fine for distinguishing sequences.

I could use ARRAY_AGG with ORDER BY, and then perhaps convert to string or keep as array for comparison.

In SQL, grouping by an array might work in DuckDB, as it supports array types.

DuckDB does support arrays, so I could use ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

Then group by the array.

In the join, comparing arrays should work.

Using strings with a delimiter might be safer for equality comparison.

I think either way is fine.

Now, about the top K: in the top_k_variants CTE, when I do SELECT variant_seq FROM variant_counts ORDER BY variant_count DESC LIMIT K, this will give me the top K, but in the join, it should work.

Then, in filtered_cases, I get the case_ids.

Finally, join back to event_log.

In the filtered_cases, I might want to include the count or something, but no, I just need the case_ids to filter the events.

Now, the output should be all events from the cases in top K variants.

Also, the prompt says "determine the top K variants by their frequency" and "return all events... that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So, my approach seems correct.

Now, I need to handle the parameter K. In the SQL query, I can write it with a placeholder, or assume K is given.

Perhaps in the query, I can use a variable.

Since it's a benchmark, probably the query should be parameterized.

But for writing the query, I'll include K as part of the query.

I need to make sure that the sequence is correctly ordered.

One thing: in the STRING_AGG or ARRAY_AGG, I'm ordering by timestamp, which is correct.

But timestamps might have ties; if two activities have the same timestamp, the order might be arbitrary. But the prompt says "sorting events within that case by their timestamp", so if timestamps are equal, the order is not specified, so it's fine.

Now, to write the complete query.

Let me outline the CTEs.

WITH case_variants AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT variant_seq, COUNT(*) AS variant_count

    FROM case_variants

    GROUP BY variant_seq

),

top_k_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_seq

    FROM variant_counts

    ORDER BY variant_count DESC

    LIMIT ?  -- here, ? can be a parameter for K

)

In SQL, LIMIT usually takes a constant, but in prepared statements, I can use a parameter.

In DuckDB, I think I can use a parameter.

To make it a subquery without LIMIT in CTE, I can use a window function.

For example:

WITH case_variants AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT variant_seq, COUNT(*) AS variant_count,

    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn

    FROM case_variants

    GROUP BY variant_seq  -- wait, no, I need to group first.

In variant_counts, I already have:

variant_counts should be grouped by variant_seq.

In my earlier variant_counts, it's SELECT variant_seq, COUNT(*) FROM case_variants GROUP BY variant_seq.

To get top K, I can add a row number.

So,

WITH case_variants AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT variant_seq, COUNT(*) AS variant_count

    FROM case_variants

    GROUP BY variant_seq

),

ranked_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_seq,

           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) AS rn

    FROM variant_counts

),

top_k_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_seq

    FROM ranked_variants

    WHERE rn <= ?  -- parameter for K

)

Then,

filtered_cases AS (

    SELECT cv.case_id

    FROM case_variants cv

    JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON cv.variant_seq = tkv.variant_seq

)

Finally,

SELECT el.*

FROM event_log el

INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id

ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp  -- optional, but good to have ordered output.

The prompt doesn't specify ordering in the output, but it's probably fine.

To avoid joining back, I could use a subquery in the WHERE clause.

For example, select from event_log where case_id in (select case_id from ...)

But with CTEs, it's clearer.

In the ranked_variants, I used ROW_NUMBER, which assigns a unique rank, so even with ties, it will arbitrarily choose which ones are in top K.

If there are ties, some variants with the same count might be included or excluded based on row number.

The prompt doesn't specify how to handle ties, so probably fine.

I could use RANK or DENSE_RANK, but then I might get more than K if there are ties.

For simplicity, I'll stick with ROW_NUMBER and LIMIT equivalent.

In my CTE, I used WHERE rn <= ? in top_k_variants.

In the ranked_variants CTE, rn is assigned, then I filter.

Yes.

Now, about the parameter K: in the SQL query, I need to indicate it.

Perhaps in the final query, I can write it with a placeholder.

Since it's a benchmark, maybe they will replace ? with a number.

Now, to complete the query.

In the variant_counts CTE, I have COUNT(*) which is the number of cases, yes.

In the join, it should work.

I think this should give the correct result.

Let me write the full query.

I need to specify the columns in the select, but since it says "return all events", I can do SELECT * FROM event_log, but joined.

In my last select, I have SELECT el.* , which is fine.

To make it efficient, perhaps I can avoid multiple scans, but in SQL, the optimizer might handle it.

Another way is to first find the top K variant sequences, then find cases with those sequences, then get events.

Yes.

I think this is correct.

Now, for the answer, I need to provide the SQL query.

Also, ensure that the sequence is correctly handled.

One potential issue: if the activity names contain the delimiter, say comma, then the string might not uniquely identify the sequence.

For example, if an activity is "A,B", then STRING_AGG with ',' might confuse.

To handle that, perhaps use a different delimiter or use ARRAY_AGG.

In DuckDB, if I use ARRAY_AGG, I can group by the array.

Let me check if DuckDB supports grouping by arrays.

Assuming it does, as it's a columnar store, it might handle it.

I can use STRING_AGG with a less likely delimiter, like '|||' or something.

But to be safe, perhaps use ARRAY_AGG.

Let me adjust.

Use ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

Then, in grouping, it should work.

In the join, comparing arrays.

In SQL, equality of arrays should work in DuckDB.

Yes.

Perhaps better.

So, change to ARRAY_AGG.

In DuckDB, the syntax is ARRAY_AGG(expression ORDER BY ...)

Yes.

So, WITH case_variants AS (

    SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

)

Then the rest is the same.

In variant_counts, GROUP BY variant_seq, which is an array.

Should be fine.

Then in top_k_variants, same.

And join on variant_seq.

Yes.

Now, for the final output, I need to return the events, so SELECT el.case_id, el.activity, el.timestamp FROM event_log el JOIN filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id

Or simply SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases)

But with CTEs, I can do it in one query.

To make it a single query, I can nest it.

But CTEs are fine.

Now, I think this should work.

Let me write the complete query.

Also, the prompt says "Construct a DuckDB SQL query", so I need to provide the SQL code.

And for K, I'll use a placeholder, say :K or something, but in standard SQL, perhaps use a parameter.

I can write it with a variable.

But in the answer, I'll write the query with a comment for K.

Since it's a benchmark, probably they will handle the parameterization.

I'll write the query with LIMIT K, but since LIMIT is in the ORDER BY subquery.

In my ranked_variants approach, I have WHERE rn <= K, so I can use a parameter there.

In SQL, I can write WHERE rn <= ?

Assuming ? is replaced with K.

Now, to box the answer.

First, the SQL query:

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant_seq, COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant_seq
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant_seq, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) AS rn
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT variant_seq
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE rn <= ?
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON cv.variant_seq = tkv.variant_seq
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

In the WHERE rn <= ?, the ? should be replaced with K.

To make it cleaner, perhaps I can use a subquery without ROW_NUMBER.

Another way: use a subquery with LIMIT.

In DuckDB, I can do:

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant_seq, COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant_seq
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT variant_seq
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY variant_count DESC
    LIMIT ?
)
-- then same as before.

LIMIT ? might not be directly supported in all SQL, but in DuckDB, it should be fine with parameters.

This might be simpler, without ROW_NUMBER.

In this case, I don't need ranked_variants CTE.

So,

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant_seq, COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant_seq
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT variant_seq
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY variant_count DESC
    LIMIT ?  -- parameter for K
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON cv.variant_seq = tkv.variant_seq
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;

Yes, this should work.

Now, in the output, I have ORDER BY, which might not be necessary, but it's good.

The prompt doesn't specify, so perhaps omit it to save computation, but it's fine.

I think this is the query.

To confirm: it correctly extracts the ordered sequence, groups and counts variants, finds top K, filters cases, and returns events.

Yes.

So, for the answer, I'll box this SQL query.
</think>

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_seq
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant_seq, COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant_seq
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT variant_seq
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY variant_count DESC
    LIMIT ?  -- Replace ? with the value of K (e.g., 5 for top 5 variants)
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON cv.variant_seq = tkv.variant_seq
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

### Explanation:
- **case_variants CTE**: Computes the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id` using `ARRAY_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp`. This ensures the sequence is correctly maintained based on the event timestamps.
- **variant_counts CTE**: Groups the sequences from `case_variants` and counts the number of cases for each unique variant sequence.
- **top_k_variants CTE**: Selects the top K variant sequences based on the count, ordered by frequency in descending order and limited to K using `LIMIT ?`. The `?` is a placeholder for the parameter K, which should be replaced with the desired number (e.g., 5 for the top 5 variants).
- **filtered_cases CTE**: Joins back to `case_variants` to identify the `case_id`s that belong to the top K variants.
- **Final SELECT**: Returns all events from the original `event_log` table for the filtered cases, ensuring only events from the top K variants are included. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the output by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity, though it is not strictly required by the prompt.

This query is optimized for DuckDB and handles the requirements efficiently. The use of `ARRAY_AGG` ensures accurate sequence representation and comparison, avoiding issues with string delimiters. The parameter for K allows flexibility in specifying the number of top variants.
