Here’s a structured list of open-ended, targeted questions designed to deepen your understanding of the property onboarding process by exploring decision-making, roles, exceptions, timing, and dependencies:

---

### **1. Initial Documentation & Verification**
- Can you walk me through the specific types of documentation you *must* have before proceeding, and how you prioritize or flag missing/incomplete items? For example, is there a hierarchy (e.g., deeds > inspection reports)?
- How do you handle cases where the landlord provides documents that are *legally valid but outdated* (e.g., a 2-year-old inspection report)? What thresholds or exceptions exist for this?
- Who ultimately approves the verification of documents, and what escalation paths exist if a coordinator disagrees with the landlord’s claims (e.g., "This deed is valid")?
- Are there regional variations in required documentation (e.g., between cities or states)? How do you ensure consistency across offices?

---

### **2. Property Manager Assignment & Specialization**
- What are the *exact criteria* used to assign a property manager? For example, is it purely workload-based, or do you also consider the property’s *type* (e.g., luxury vs. student housing) or the landlord’s *history* (e.g., high-maintenance vs. hands-off)?
- How do you measure a manager’s "experience with similar property types"? Are there predefined categories (e.g., "apartment complexes," "condos," "single-family homes"), or is it more nuanced?
- What happens if a property requires a manager with a skill set no one currently has (e.g., a property with a unique amenity like a rooftop pool)? How is this gap addressed?
- Are there *performance metrics* tied to manager assignments (e.g., time-to-lease, tenant retention rates) that influence future assignments?

---

### **3. Landlord-Manager Alignment & Special Conditions**
- How do you structure the introductory call/meeting to ensure alignment? Are there *standardized scripts* or *checklists* used to cover all critical topics (e.g., pet policies, maintenance responsibilities)?
- What are the most common *special conditions* you encounter (e.g., furnished units, turnkey services), and how do these affect the onboarding timeline or resource allocation?
- How do you handle disputes between the landlord and manager during this phase? For example, if the landlord insists on a 100% refundable security deposit but the manager’s policy caps it at 1.5x rent.
- Are there *contractual clauses* in the landlord-manager agreement that address these special conditions upfront, or are they negotiated ad hoc?

---

### **4. Inspection & Repairs**
- What is the *standard timeline* from inspection scheduling to completion? How do you account for delays (e.g., contractor unavailability, landlord non-response)?
- How do you prioritize repairs identified during inspection? For example, is a broken HVAC system addressed before cosmetic fixes, or is it based on cost/urgency?
- Who bears the cost of repairs: the landlord, the company, or a shared arrangement? Are there *budget thresholds* that trigger escalation (e.g., repairs over $5K require approval)?
- How do you document and track repairs to ensure accountability? For example, do you use a shared spreadsheet, a CRM field, or a dedicated repair-tracking system?

---

### **5. Marketing & Pricing**
- How do you determine the *initial rental price range* for a property? Is it based on:
  - Recent comparable properties in the area?
  - The landlord’s requested price?
  - A blend of both with company-wide pricing models?
- Who has authority to adjust the price after initial listing? For example, can a property manager lower it to fill a vacancy, or does it require approval?
- How do you handle *market fluctuations* during onboarding? For example, if the property is listed but the local rental market crashes before leasing.
- What role does the digital marketing team play in pricing? Do they provide data on demand elasticity (e.g., "Lowering price by 10% increases inquiries by 30%")?

---

### **6. Tenant Screening & Lease Finalization**
- What are the *key decision criteria* for selecting a tenant when multiple applicants are qualified? For example, do you prioritize:
  - Highest credit score?
  - Longest lease commitment?
  - Fastest move-in date?
  - Or a combination with weighted factors?
- How do you handle *gray-area cases* in screening? For example, a tenant with a low credit score but strong employment history and references.
- What is the *typical timeline* from lease signing to move-in? What are the most common bottlenecks (e.g., security deposit processing, utility transfers)?
- How do you ensure compliance with *fair housing laws* during screening? For example, are there automated checks to prevent bias in tenant selection?

---

### **7. Quality Checks & Internal Audits**
- Who performs the *compliance review* of the lease, and what are the most common violations you’ve seen (e.g., unclear pet policies, non-standard termination clauses)?
- How does the financial team verify that the rental price aligns with profitability targets? Are there *automated alerts* if a property is underpriced or overpriced?
- What happens if the IT team finds discrepancies in the property’s online listing (e.g., wrong address, missing amenities)? Who fixes it, and what’s the impact on the lease?
- Are there *post-onboarding audits* to ensure all steps were followed correctly? For example, checking that all required inspections were documented.

---

### **8. Exceptions & Edge Cases**
- What are the *most complex or time-consuming* properties you’ve onboarded, and why? For example, a property with:
  - Unique legal restrictions (e.g., HOA overlays)?
  - Multiple owners with conflicting demands?
  - A history of tenant disputes?
- How do you handle landlords who *refuse to comply* with company policies (e.g., won’t allow inspections, demand cash payments)?
- Are there *properties that fail onboarding* entirely? If so, what are the typical reasons (e.g., safety violations, landlord withdrawal), and how is this documented?
- How do you manage *emergency situations* during onboarding (e.g., a property is damaged by a storm before leasing)?

---
### **9. Communication & Tools**
- How do you track the *status of each onboarding step* across teams? For example, is there a central dashboard showing which properties are in "document review," "inspection pending," etc.?
- What are the *most critical communication touchpoints* between stakeholders (e.g., landlord-manager syncs, inspector reports, tenant screening updates)?
- How do you ensure *transparency* with landlords about delays or issues? For example, if repairs are taking longer than expected.
- Are there *standardized templates* for emails or internal notes to maintain consistency in communication?

---
### **10. Metrics & Continuous Improvement**
- What *key performance indicators (KPIs)* do you track for the onboarding process? For example:
  - Time from initial contact to lease signing?
  - Cost per property onboarding?
  - Tenant retention rate post-onboarding?
- How do you *measure the success* of a property manager’s onboarding performance?
- Have you identified *bottlenecks* in the process that you’ve optimized recently? For example, automating document uploads or streamlining inspector scheduling.
- What *feedback loops* exist to improve the process? For example, do landlords or managers provide input on pain points?

---
### **11. Regional & Scalability Considerations**
- How does the onboarding process differ between *high-volume markets* (e.g., NYC) and *low-volume markets* (e.g., rural areas)?
- As the company grows, how do you ensure *consistency* in onboarding across new regional offices or managers?
- Are there *standard operating procedures (SOPs)* for onboarding, or is it more ad hoc based on the property?
- How do you handle *seasonal variations* (e.g., higher demand in summer for student housing)?

---
These questions are designed to uncover the *nuances, dependencies, and decision logic* behind the process while avoiding technical implementation details. They also help identify areas where the process might be optimized or where exceptions create variability.
