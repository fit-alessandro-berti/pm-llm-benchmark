The picture is a BPMN (Business-Process-Model-and-Notation) diagram that explains how a computer-hardware shop prepares an outbound shipment.  
The model is laid out in three horizontal swim-lanes that show who does what:

1. Logistics (top lane)  
2. Dispatch-of-Goods / Shop secretary (middle lane)  
3. Warehouse (bottom lane)

Flow, decisions and artefacts

A. Start event – “Ship goods” (the request that something has to be sent).

B. Parallel split  
   • A parallel-gateway (diamond with “”) starts two independent streams at the same time:  
     – Administrative work in the Dispatch-of-Goods lane.  
     – Physical packing work in the Warehouse lane.

C. Administrative / logistics branch (middle & top lanes)  
   1. Clarify shipment method (task).  
   2. Exclusive gateway “Special handling?”  
      • If NO, jump straight to the insurance check.  
      • If YES:  
        a. Get 3 offers from logistic companies.  
        b. Select a logistic company and place the order.  
   3. Check if insurance is required (task that reads “Customer information” data store).  
      • If insurance is necessary, insure parcel (task in Logistics lane).  
   4. Write package label (always performed).  

D. Physical packing branch (Warehouse lane)  
   1. Package goods (task).  
      • A boundary timer event (“48 hours”) is attached – if the packaging task is not finished within two days the process triggers “Notify customer about delay”.  
   2. When packaging is finished the flow rejoins the administrative branch in a parallel-gateway.

E. Merge and completion (Logistics lane)  
   1. The two streams (logistics paperwork and physical packing) converge in a parallel-gateway.  
   2. Fill out shipment paperwork (task).  
   3. Move package to pickup area (task).  
   4. End event – “Shipment prepared”.

Key BPMN elements visible

• Start and end events (white and black circles).  
• Tasks / activities (rounded rectangles).  
• Parallel gateways (diamond with “”) for splitting / synchronising simultaneous work.  
• Exclusive gateways (empty diamond) for either-or decisions (“yes / no”).  
• Boundary timer event (clock symbol) attached to “Package goods” for deadline escalation.  
• Data object “Order details” and data store “Customer information” that feed the decision about insurance.  

Overall meaning

The chart shows that the shop:

• Begins packing and administrative preparations in parallel.  
• Only seeks freight quotations when the parcel needs special handling.  
• Takes out insurance only when the customer or order attributes demand it.  
• Escalates to the customer automatically if packaging has not finished within 48 hours.  
• Combines all streams, completes paperwork, moves the parcel to the pickup area, and then the shipment is regarded as ready.
