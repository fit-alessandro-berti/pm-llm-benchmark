### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model:

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**:  
   - **Average Time**: ~25 hours  
   - **Standard Deviation**: Very low (1 hour)  
   - **Concern**: Suggests a rigid approval schedule.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:  
   - **Average Time**: 7 days  
   - **Standard Deviation**: High (2 days)  
   - **Concern**: Indicates significant delays or inconsistency in notification.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:  
   - **Average Time**: 2 hours  
   - **Concern**: Possible premature closure of claims without necessary evaluations or approvals.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:  
   - **Average Time**: 5 minutes  
   - **Concern**: Suggests an unrealistic rapid transition that may skip steps.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies:

1. **R to P Delays**:  
   - May result from systemic delays in the approval process due to manual data entry or complex decision-making policies.

2. **P to N Delays**:  
   - Potential bottlenecks could be occurring where notifications are not prioritized, or there may be inconsistent staff assignments leading to erratic timing.

3. **A to C Quick Closures**:  
   - Indicates potential laxity in process adherence, resulting in claims being closed without due review, possibly driven by performance targets.

4. **E to N Rapid Notifications**:  
   - Might reflect automated transitions that skip necessary documentation or checks post-evaluation, which can lead to compliance risks.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries:

1. **Identify Claims with Unusual Times (R to P):**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, 
          MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'R') AS received_time,
          MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS approved_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') - 
                             MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'R'))) AS time_to_approve
   FROM claim_events
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING time_to_approve > 90000;  -- 25 hours in seconds
   ```

2. **Correlate P to N Timing Delays:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, 
          MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS approved_time,
          MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') AS notified_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') - 
                             MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P'))) AS time_to_notify
   FROM claim_events
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING time_to_notify > 604800;  -- 7 days in seconds
   ```

3. **Examine A to C Quick Closures:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id,
          MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'A') AS assigned_time,
          MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') AS closed_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') - 
                             MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'A'))) AS time_to_close
   FROM claim_events
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING time_to_close < 7200;  -- 2 hours in seconds
   ```

4. **Review E to N Rapid Notifications:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, 
          MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') AS evaluated_time,
          MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') AS notified_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') - 
                             MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E'))) AS time_to_notify
   FROM claim_events
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING time_to_notify < 300;  -- 5 minutes in seconds
   ```
