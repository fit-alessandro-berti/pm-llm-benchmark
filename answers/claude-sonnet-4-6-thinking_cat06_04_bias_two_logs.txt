# Bias Analysis: Comparing Event Logs for Group A and Group B

## Executive Summary

**The process exhibited in Group B's log reveals systematic bias.** The bias operates through a score adjustment mechanism tied to `LocalResident` status and `CommunityGroup` membership — attributes that are structurally inaccessible to Group A — producing materially different outcomes for applicants with equivalent or even superior underlying qualifications.

## Side-by-Side Structural Comparison

| Attribute | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|---|---|---|
| `LocalResident` | Always **FALSE** | Always **TRUE** |
| `CommunityGroup` | Always **None** | Sometimes "Highland Civic Darts Club" |
| `ScoreAdjustment` | Always **0** | **+10** if in community group, else 0 |
| Adjustment Label | None | *"Community Boost"* |
| Boost Eligibility | **Never** | **Conditional** |

## How the Bias Manifests

### 1. The Score Adjustment Mechanism Is Gatekept by Protected Attributes

The `+10 Community Boost` is only triggered when two conditions align:

```
LocalResident = TRUE  AND  CommunityGroup  None
```

Because **all Group A members have `LocalResident = FALSE`**, they are structurally excluded from ever receiving this boost — not due to merit, but due to their group membership status. The scoring system has a built-in privilege ladder that Group A cannot access.

### 2. The Critical Outcome Inversion: U003 vs. P002

This is the most damning evidence of bias:

| Case | Group | Preliminary Score | Adjustment | Final Score | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P002** | A (Protected) | **710** | 0 | **710** |  **Rejected** |
| **U003** | B (Unprotected) | **695** | +10 | **705** |  **Approved** |

> **U003 had a *lower* raw score than P002 (695 vs. 710), yet was approved while P002 was rejected.**

This outcome inversion is direct evidence of disparate impact. The community boost artificially elevated U003 above the apparent approval threshold (~710), while P002 — a more qualified applicant by the raw metric — fell below it with no compensating mechanism available. The process rewarded social affiliation over objective qualification.

### 3. Score Inflation Without Merit Justification

| Case | Raw Score | Adjusted Score | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| U001 | 720 | 730 (+10) | Approved |
| U003 | 695 | 705 (+10) | Approved |
| P001 | 720 | 720 (no change) | Approved |
| P002 | 710 | 710 (no change) | Rejected |

U001 and P001 both had raw scores of 720 and were both approved — suggesting the boost was irrelevant in U001's case. However, for U003, the boost was **outcome-determinative**. There is no documented evidence that membership in a darts club carries any legitimate predictive relevance to whatever the scoring system is evaluating (creditworthiness, risk, eligibility, etc.).

---

### 4. Process-Level Laundering of Bias

The boost is applied at the `PreliminaryScoring` stage by the **Scoring Engine** and then carries forward transparently through `ManualReview` and `FinalDecision`. This means:

- **Underwriters** see the adjusted score, anchoring their judgment to an inflated number
- **The Rules Engine** fires on the adjusted score as if it were factual
- The bias is **institutionalized** — no single actor appears to discriminate, yet the outcome is discriminatory

This is a hallmark of *systemic* or *structural* bias: it is embedded in the process architecture, not in any individual's conscious decision.

## Conclusion

The bias is **systemic, structural, and outcome-determinative**. Group B's log reveals a process that:

1. **Uses proxy variables** (`LocalResident`, `CommunityGroup`) correlated with group membership to determine score adjustments
2. **Creates a two-tier scoring system** where one group can boost scores and the other cannot
3. **Produces outcome inversions** where lower-scoring applicants in Group B are approved over higher-scoring applicants in Group A
4. **Launders the advantage** through automated systems so it appears procedurally neutral

The fair resolution would require either extending equivalent adjustment opportunities to all applicants based on genuinely merit-relevant criteria, or eliminating adjustments that cannot be demonstrated to have legitimate, non-discriminatory predictive validity.
