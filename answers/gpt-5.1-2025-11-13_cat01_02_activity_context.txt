Below is a disambiguated version of the log plus a brief justification of the renamings.

## 1. Contextual interpretation of recurring activities

Activities that recur within the same case:

- **Verify Documents**
  - C001: done twice (before and after customer submits additional documents).
  - C003: done twice (before and after an account adjustment).
- **Call Customer**
  - C001: once, to request missing documents.
  - C002: twice (first to clarify discrepancy, then to confirm adjustments).
  - C003: once, to get the customer to return to the branch.

The meaning changes based on:
- Whether it is the first vs. subsequent occurrence.
- The “Additional Context” text.
- What has just happened in the process (e.g., after “Submit Additional” or “Adjust Account”).
- The channel (branch vs. portal) and purpose of the call.

## 4. Justification of naming choices

**Verify Documents**
- **Initial Identity Document Verification / Identity Verification Check / Initial Physical Document Verification**  
  - Labeled “Initial” to mark that this is the first document check in the case.  
  - Differentiated by channel: “Identity Document” for back office, “Physical” for in-branch check.
- **Reverification After Additional Documents** (C001)  
  - Occurs after “Submit Additional”; explicitly tied to newly submitted documents.
- **Reverification After Account Adjustment** (C003)  
  - Occurs after “Internal Account Correction”; reflects that the verification is done in the new account state.

**Call Customer**
- **Outbound Call – Request Missing Documents** (C001)  
  - Purpose is to obtain missing documentation after a failed initial verification.
- **Outbound Call – Clarify Account Discrepancy** (C002, first call)  
  - Purpose is diagnosis: clarifying an issue before account adjustment.
- **Outbound Call – Confirm Account Adjustments** (C002, second call)  
  - Purpose is confirmation of changes already made.
- **Outbound Call – Recall Customer to Branch** (C003)  
  - Purpose is logistical: get a walkin customer to physically return.

**Initiate Request**
- **Initiate Request via Portal / at Branch**  
  - Clarifies the entry channel (online vs. walkin), which is often important in process analysis.

**Adjust Account**
- **Internal Account Adjustment / Internal Account Correction**  
  - “Internal” emphasizes back-office work; “Adjustment vs. Correction” echoes the wording in the original context (“Adjust account details” vs. “Internal correction due to missing info”) but both clearly refer to backoffice data changes.

**Approve Request**
- **Final Request Approval**  
  - Indicates it is the terminal approval step in the workflow, done by a supervisor.

These renamings keep the core meaning of each original activity while disambiguating their role, timing (initial vs. re), channel (portal vs. branch), and intent (requesting info, clarifying discrepancy, confirming changes).
