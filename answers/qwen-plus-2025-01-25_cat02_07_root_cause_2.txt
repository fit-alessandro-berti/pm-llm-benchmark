### Step 1: Identify Cases with Extended Durations

To identify cases with significantly longer durations, we calculate the total time taken for each case from the "Submit Claim" activity to the "Close Claim" activity. The timestamps allow us to compute these durations.

#### Case-by-Case Duration Analysis:

| Case ID | Start Time          | End Time            | Total Duration (Hours) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00   | 2024-04-01 10:30   | **1.5 hours**         |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05   | 2024-04-02 11:00   | **25.9 hours**        |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10   | 2024-04-03 09:30   | **48.3 hours**        |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20   | 2024-04-01 10:45   | **1.4 hours**         |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25   | 2024-04-04 14:30   | **79.1 hours**        |

From this analysis:
- **Cases 2002, 2003, and 2005** have significantly longer durations compared to cases 2001 and 2004.

### Step 2: Analyze Attributes to Determine Root Causes

We now analyze the attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity) of the identified cases to uncover potential root causes.

#### Attribute Analysis:

1. **Complexity Level:**
   - **Low Complexity:** Cases 2001 and 2004 were completed quickly (1.5 and 1.4 hours, respectively).
   - **Medium Complexity:** Case 2002 took 25.9 hours.
   - **High Complexity:** Cases 2003 and 2005 took 48.3 and 79.1 hours, respectively.
   - **Observation:** High-complexity claims consistently take much longer than low or medium-complexity claims. This suggests that complexity is a major driver of extended durations.

2. **Region:**
   - **Region A:** Cases 2001 (1.5 hours), 2003 (48.3 hours).
   - **Region B:** Cases 2002 (25.9 hours), 2004 (1.4 hours), 2005 (79.1 hours).
   - **Observation:** While both regions handle cases efficiently for low-complexity claims, Region B struggles more with high-complexity claims (e.g., Case 2005). This indicates that Region B may lack sufficient resources or expertise to handle complex cases effectively.

3. **Resource:**
   - **CSR_Jane:** Handles Cases 2001 (1.5 hours) and 2003 (48.3 hours).
   - **CSR_Paul:** Handles Cases 2002 (25.9 hours) and 2005 (79.1 hours).
   - **CSR_Mary:** Handles Case 2004 (1.4 hours).
   - **Adjuster_Lisa:** Handles Cases 2002 (25.9 hours), 2004 (1.4 hours), and 2005 (79.1 hours).
   - **Adjuster_Mike:** Handles Cases 2001 (1.5 hours) and 2003 (48.3 hours).
   - **Observation:** Adjuster_Lisa and CSR_Paul seem to struggle with high-complexity cases (e.g., Case 2005), while CSR_Mary and Adjuster_Mike perform better on simpler cases. This suggests variability in resource efficiency depending on the complexity level.

4. **Additional Document Requests:**
   - Cases 2002, 2003, and 2005 all involve multiple requests for additional documents, which significantly extend their durations.
   - **Observation:** The need for repeated document requests correlates strongly with longer processing times, especially for high-complexity claims.

### Step 3: Propose Explanations and Mitigation Strategies

#### Root Cause Explanations:
1. **Complexity Level:**
   - High-complexity claims inherently require more time due to the nature of the evaluation process, the need for additional documentation, and higher scrutiny during approval.

2. **Region Differences:**
   - Region B appears less efficient at handling high-complexity claims, possibly due to fewer experienced staff or insufficient training.

3. **Resource Efficiency:**
   - Certain resources (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa and CSR_Paul) may lack the skills or bandwidth to manage high-complexity cases effectively.

4. **Process Bottlenecks:**
   - Repeated requests for additional documents indicate inefficiencies in the initial evaluation phase, where critical information is not gathered upfront.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Enhance Resource Training:**
   - Provide specialized training for adjusters and customer service representatives in handling high-complexity claims to reduce processing times.

2. **Optimize Regional Workload Allocation:**
   - Redistribute high-complexity cases to Region A if it has more experienced personnel or allocate additional resources to Region B.

3. **Streamline Documentation Requirements:**
   - Improve the initial claim submission process to ensure all necessary information is provided upfront, reducing the need for repeated document requests.

4. **Implement Process Automation:**
   - Use automated tools to flag missing or incomplete information during the evaluation phase, enabling earlier identification of gaps.

5. **Monitor Performance Metrics:**
   - Continuously track case durations by complexity, region, and resource to identify emerging bottlenecks and address them proactively.

### Final Answer:

The cases with performance issues are **2002, 2003, and 2005**, and the root causes include:
- High complexity levels requiring multiple document requests.
- Regional differences in efficiency, particularly for Region B.
- Variability in resource performance when handling complex cases.

**Mitigation strategies** focus on enhancing training, redistributing workloads, streamlining documentation, and leveraging automation to improve overall process efficiency. 

**Boxed Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\text{Cases 2002, 2003, and 2005 have performance issues due to high complexity, regional inefficiencies, and resource variability.}}
