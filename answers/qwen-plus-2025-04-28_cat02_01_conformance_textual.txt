Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process thoroughly. The process starts with "Receive order," then checks inventory. If inventory is sufficient, the next steps are authorize payment, package items, then ship order and close. If inventory isn't enough, it cancels the order and closes immediately.

So, the key constraints are:
1. Authorize payment must come after check inventory and before packaging.
2. Package items must come after authorization and before shipping.
3. Ship order must come after packaging and not after cancellation.
4. Close order is the final step in all cases.

Now, looking at each case in the event log:

Case 1: All steps are in order. Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. That's correct. No violations here.

Case 2: Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, here the sequence is Check (okay), then Package (which should come after Authorization). So Package is before Authorization. That violates the rule that Package must come after Authorization. So this is a violation.

Case 3: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. Here, after Authorize, they cancel. Then ship. But according to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient (which it is here since they canceled), they should cancel and then close. So the Ship order is after cancellation, which is not allowed. Also, the cancellation is done after authorization, which is not allowed. The cancellation should come after check inventory. But in this case, the steps are Check, Authorize, Cancel. So the cancellation is done before check inventory? Wait no, the check inventory is at 09:20, then Authorize at 09:40, then Cancel at 10:00. So the cancellation is after authorization. But the normative process says that if inventory is insufficient, you should cancel immediately after check inventory. So in this case, the cancellation is done after authorization, which is not allowed. Also, after canceling, you should close, not ship. So this case has two violations: cancellation after authorization, and ship after cancel.

Case 4: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. Here, the steps are Check, then Cancel, then Close. That's okay? According to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient, the process should be Check, then Cancel, then Close. So this is correct. But wait, the normative process says that after checking inventory, you proceed to Cancel. So this case is correct. However, the problem is that the cancellation is done before the Close. But in the normative process, after canceling, you close. So this is correct. So maybe this is not a violation.

Wait, but in the original description, the cancellation scenario is "Check inventory, then Cancel order, then Close order." So Case 4 is exactly that. So no violation here.

Case 5: Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Here, the sequence is Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. But according to the normative process, after authorization, you need to package items before shipping. So here, shipment happens before packaging. That's a violation. Also, the Close is after ship, which is not allowed. So this is two violations: ship before packaging, and close after ship.

So summarizing:

Case 2: Package before Authorize  violation.

Case 3: Cancel after Authorize  violation. Also, Ship after Cancel  violation.

Case 5: Ship before Package  violation. Close after Ship  violation.

Wait, but the original problem says to identify which cases violate. Let me check each case again.

Case 2: Steps are Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. So Package is before Authorize. So that's a violation.

Case 3: Steps are Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. So after Authorize, Cancel, then Ship. So two violations: 1. Cancel after Authorize (since authorization should be before cancellation). 2. Ship after Cancel (since cancellation should be followed by Close, not Ship). So both are violations.

Case 5: Steps are Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. So Ship before Package. Also, Close after Ship. So both violations.

Case 4: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. Correct. No violation.

Case 1: Correct.

So the violations are Cases 2, 3, 5. Now, need to explain each.

For Case 2: The sequence is Check, then Package, then Authorize. But according to the normative process, Package must occur after Authorization. So the violation is that Package is done before Authorize. So that's a violation.

For Case 3: The sequence is Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. The problem is that the cancellation step is done after authorization. According to the process, if inventory is insufficient, you should check inventory, then cancel. So the cancellation should happen after check. But in this case, after authorization (which is done after check), they cancel. So that's a violation. Also, after cancellation, the process should close, not ship. So that's another violation.

For Case 5: The sequence is Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. The problem is that Ship occurs before Package. According to the normative process, Ship must come after Package. So that's a violation. Also, Close occurs after Ship, which is not allowed. So both violations.

So the answer would be those three cases.

**Violation Analysis:**

1. **Case 2 (ID 2):**  
   - **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."  
   - **Explanation:** According to the normative process, "Package items" must occur **after** "Authorize payment" (since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is confirmed). In this case, the sequence violates this constraint, as packaging precedes authorization.

2. **Case 3 (ID 3):**  
   - **Violation 1:** "Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment."  
   - **Violation 2:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."  
   - **Explanation:** The cancellation step must follow the "Check inventory" activity and precede "Close order." Here, cancellation occurs after authorization (violating the requirement that cancellation should follow inventory check) and is followed by shipping (which is invalid because the process should terminate at "Close order" after cancellation).  

3. **Case 5 (ID 5):**  
   - **Violation 1:** "Ship order" occurs before "Package items."  
   - **Violation 2:** "Close order" occurs after "Ship order."  
   - **Explanation:** "Ship order" must follow "Package items," and "Close order" is the final activity. In this case, shipping precedes packaging and closes after shipping, violating these sequential rules.

**Summary of Violations:**  
- **Case 2:** "Package items" before "Authorize payment."  
- **Case 3:** "Cancel order" after "Authorize payment" and "Ship order" after "Cancel order."  
- **Case 5:** "Ship order" before "Package items" and "Close order" after "Ship order."  

These deviations violate the core constraints of the normative process, including the sequential dependencies between activities (e.g., authorization  packaging  shipping) and the termination logic (e.g., cancellation  close).
