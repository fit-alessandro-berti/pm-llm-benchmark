### 1 Normative Rule Violations  

| Case ID | Activity/Step where the rule is broken | Why it breaks a normative constraint |
|---------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **2**   | **CreditCheck missing before Risk Assessment** (Risk Assessment occurs at08:20, Credit Check only at09:00) | The defined sequence *Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment* is violated.  A risk assessment must never be performed without a prior credit check; the process prescribes that **Credit Check** be completed before any downstream activities (Risk Assessment, Loan Decision, etc.). |
| **2**   | **Finalize Documentation after a Rejection** (Loan Decision = *Rejected* at09:30 but Finalize Documentation is recorded at10:00) | The rule “If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case” is explicitly broken.  Once the decision has been made to reject, the workflow must close the case without any further action such as document finalization. |
| **3**   *(optional)* | **Credit Check performed >24h after Application Received** (Application at09:00 on Jan12  Credit Check only at10:00 on Jan14) | This does not breach a hard rule, but it violates the recommended timing for credit checks (ideally within 24h). It is therefore a *desideratum* violation rather than a normative one. |

> **Bottom line:**  
> - **Case2** contains two separate violations of the strict process rules.  
> - **Cases1 and3** respect every rule; they are fully compliant with the “strict” part of the specification.

### 2 Desiderata (Timing / Followup) Violations  

| Case ID | Recommended Timing Recommendation Affected | Observed Gap | Interpretation |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **1**   | Credit Check within *24h* of Application Received <br>Inform Applicant within *48h* of Loan Decision | Both times are comfortably met (Credit Check at 09:30  0.5h after receipt; Inform Applicant at 13:00 3h after decision). | No desideratum issue – the case proceeds efficiently. |
| **2**   | Credit Check within *24h* of Application Received <br>Inform Applicant within *48h* of Loan Decision | Not applicable because a violation already exists (missing credit check & premature document finalization). Even if it were followed, the case would still be “noncompliant” under normative rules. |
| **3**   | Credit Check within *24h* <br>Inform Applicant within *48h* <br>Followup Call before Closing (optional) | • Credit check done >2days later – violates the “short time window” recommendation.<br>• Inform Applicant ~3days after decision – again exceeds the 48h guideline.<br>• No followup call is recorded. | All three are **desiderata** (recommendations, not hard rules). The case still satisfies every normative constraint; it simply shows suboptimal timing and lack of a postdecision contact that could have improved transparency or detected issues early. |

### 3 Interpretation & Recommendations  

| Case | What the observed behavior suggests | How to improve (if desired) |
|------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **2** | The applicant’s file was processed out of order, and documentation was prepared even though the decision was “Rejected.” This could indicate either a data entry error or an attempt to bypass controls. Because normative rules are strict, this case must be corrected before it can move forward in any compliance audit. | 1 Rerun the process from scratch: start with Application Received  Credit Check (must happen first)  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Rejected). <br>2 Do **not** finalize documentation after a rejection.<br>3 Close the case immediately after notifying the applicant. |
| **1** | The process followed all hard rules perfectly and adhered to timing recommendations, indicating good operational discipline. No corrective action is needed beyond standard monitoring of future cases. | Continue current practice; optionally add automated alerts if any step exceeds recommended time windows (e.g., >2h for credit check). |
| **3** | All normative steps are correct, but the team waited much longer than suggested to inform the applicant and never conducted a followup call. While not penalizable under strict rules, delayed communication can lead to higher customer frustration or missed opportunities to address concerns before closure. | 1 Implement automated reminders or workflow triggers that ensure Credit Checks are completed within **24h** of receipt.<br>2 Send the “Loan Decision” notification automatically once the decision is recorded, aiming for 48h turnaround.<br>3 Add a simple “Followup Call” step before Close Case (could be optional but recommended). This helps confirm that documentation was received and understood by the applicant. |

### Quick Checklist for Future Cases  

|  | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **Sequence** | Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  *(If Approved: Finalize Documentation)*  Close Case |
| **Ordering Rules** | • Credit Check before Risk Assessment <br>• Risk Assessment before Loan Decision <br>• Loan Decision determines whether to finalize documentation (only for *Approved*) |
| **No Contradictions** | Do not finalize documentation after a rejection; do not close case without informing the applicant. |
| **Desiderata (BestPractice)** | • Credit Check 24h after receipt <br>• Inform Applicant 48h after decision <br>• Optional Followup Call before closure to ensure all parties are aligned |

By following this checklist, your loan application process will satisfy both the **normative** (hard) constraints and the **desiderata** (recommended best practices).
