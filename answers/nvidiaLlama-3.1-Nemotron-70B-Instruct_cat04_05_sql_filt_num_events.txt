**Solution Query:**
```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    COUNT(*) AS event_count
  FROM 
    event_log
  GROUP BY 
    case_id
  HAVING 
    COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT 
  el.*
FROM 
  event_log el
  INNER JOIN case_event_counts cec ON el.case_id = cec.case_id
ORDER BY 
  el.case_id, 
  el.timestamp;
```
**Explanation and Breakdown:**

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) - `case_event_counts`:**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the event count per `case_id` and filter out those with more than six events.
   - **Columns:**
     - `case_id`: Unique identifier for each case.
     - `event_count`: Total number of events per `case_id`.
   - **Query Logic:**
     - `GROUP BY case_id`: Group events by their respective case IDs.
     - `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`: Filter the grouped results to include only those with six or fewer events.

2. **Main Query:**
   - **Purpose:** Retrieve all events from cases that have six or fewer events, as identified by the CTE.
   - **Join Logic:**
     - `INNER JOIN`: Ensures only `case_id`s present in both the `event_log` and the filtered `case_event_counts` CTE are included.
   - **Selected Columns:**
     - `el.*`: Retrieves all columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, etc.) for the filtered events.
   - **Sorting:**
     - `ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp`: Sorts the output by `case_id` and then by `timestamp` for clarity and ease of analysis.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose your `event_log` table contains the following events:

| `case_id` | `activity` | `timestamp`         |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| 1         | Start      | 2023-01-01 09:00:00 |
| 1         | Task A     | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 |
| 1         | Task B     | 2023-01-01 11:00:00 |
| 2         | Start      | 2023-01-02 09:00:00 |
| 2         | Task X     | 2023-01-02 10:00:00 |
| 2         | Task Y     | 2023-01-02 11:00:00 |
| 2         | Task Z     | 2023-01-02 12:00:00 |
| 2         | End        | 2023-01-02 13:00:00 |
| 2         | Review     | 2023-01-02 14:00:00 |
| 3         | Begin      | 2023-01-03 09:00:00 |
| 3         | Approved   | 2023-01-03 10:00:00 |

**Output after running the query:**

| `case_id` | `activity` | `timestamp`         |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| 1         | Start      | 2023-01-01 09:00:00 |
| 1         | Task A     | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 |
| 1         | Task B     | 2023-01-01 11:00:00 |
| 3         | Begin      | 2023-01-03 09:00:00 |
| 3         | Approved   | 2023-01-03 10:00:00 |

**Note:** Case ID 2 is excluded because it contains more than six events.
