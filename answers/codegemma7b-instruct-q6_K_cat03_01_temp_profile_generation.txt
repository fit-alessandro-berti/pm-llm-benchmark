## Temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay process

Based on the characteristics of a Purchase-to-Pay process, I propose the following temporal profile:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Purchase Requisition', 'Purchase Order'): (48000, 18000),  # Average: 4 hours, Standard deviation: 3 hours
    ('Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'): (24000, 12000),  # Average: 2 days, Standard deviation: 6 hours
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Approval'): (12000, 6000),  # Average: 1 day, Standard deviation: 3 hours
    ('Invoice Approval', 'Payment Request'): (86400, 3600),  # Average: 1 day, Standard deviation: 1 hour
    ('Payment Request', 'Payment Execution'): (43200, 18000),  # Average: 1 day, Standard deviation: 3 hours
}
```

**Notes:**

* The times are in seconds, representing the average and standard deviation.
* These are just estimates, and the actual times may vary depending on factors such as size and complexity of the organization, and specific purchasing and payment processes.
* The standard deviation is relatively high compared to the average, indicating that there is a significant amount of variation in the time between activities in this process.
* Additional activities or variations in the process may require additional entries in the temporal profile.

**Additional considerations:**

* The temporal profile can be used to analyze the actual execution times of the Purchase-to-Pay process in a specific organization.
* The temporal profile can be used to identify potential bottlenecks in the process and opportunities for improvement.
* The temporal profile can be used to generate forecasts of the expected execution times of the process.
