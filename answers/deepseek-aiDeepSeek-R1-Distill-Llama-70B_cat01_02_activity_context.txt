Okay, I'm trying to help with renaming activities in a process event log. The goal is to change the activity names so that their different contexts within a case are clear. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I need to look at the event log. I see three cases: C001, C002, and C003. Each case has multiple activities, and some activities repeat within a case. My task is to find which activities are repeated and figure out how their meanings change based on where they appear in the process.

Looking at C001, I see "Verify Documents" appears twice. The timing is different, so maybe the first time is an initial check, and the second is a re-check after more documents were submitted. Also, "Call Customer" only happens once, so I don't need to rename that.

In C002, "Verify Documents" also happens once, but "Call Customer" happens twice. The first call is to clarify an account discrepancy, and the second is a follow-up. So I should rename these two calls to reflect their purposes.

In C003, "Verify Documents" appears twice as well. The first time is a physical check at the branch, and the second is after some adjustments. "Call Customer" is once again used when the officer calls the customer to return. "Adjust Account" happens once, so no need to rename that.

Now, I should list all activities that repeat within a case. In C001 and C003, "Verify Documents" is repeated. In C002, "Call Customer" is repeated. These are the ones to rename.

For "Verify Documents" in C001: The first instance is an initial check, so maybe "Initial Document Verification." The second is after the customer submitted more documents, so perhaps "Document Re-verification."

In C003, the first "Verify Documents" is at the branch, so "Physical Document Verification." The second time is after adjustments, maybe "Post-Adjustment Document Verification."

For "Call Customer" in C002: The first call is to clarify something, so "Clarification Call." The follow-up could be "Follow-Up Call."

I need to make sure these new names clearly show the context. Maybe "Initial Document Verification" and "Document Re-verification" capture the different stages. "Clarification Call" and "Follow-Up Call" explain why the call was made each time.

I should then rewrite each case with these new activity names and check if each activity is now unique within its case, with clear meanings.

For example, in C001, after renaming, the activities should be Initiate Request, Initial Document Verification, Call Customer, Submit Additional, Document Re-verification, and Approve Request.

In C002: Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Clarification Call, Adjust Account, Follow-Up Call, Approve Request.

In C003: Initiate Request, Physical Document Verification, Call Customer, Adjust Account, Post-Adjustment Document Verification, Approve Request.

I should present this in a table format, showing the changes for each case, and then explain the reasoning for each name change.

I think that's a good plan. Now I just need to apply these changes consistently and make sure the new names accurately reflect the context each activity occurs in.

### Justification for Renaming

1. **"Initial Document Verification" and "Document Re-Verification" (C001):**
   - *Context:* The first "Verify Documents" occurs immediately after the request initiation and is the initial check of the customer's identity. The second instance happens after the customer submits additional documents, requiring a re-verification.
   - *Naming Choice:* "Initial Document Verification" captures the first check, while "Document Re-Verification" highlights the re-examination of documents after additional information was submitted.

2. **"Clarification Call" and "Follow-Up Call" (C002):**
   - *Context:* The first "Call Customer" is made to clarify discrepancies in the account, while the second "Call Customer" is a follow-up to ensure the adjustments made are correct.
   - *Naming Choice:* "Clarification Call" reflects the purpose of resolving discrepancies, whereas "Follow-Up Call" emphasizes the confirmatory nature of the second call.

3. **"Physical Document Verification" and "Post-Adjustment Document Verification" (C003):**
   - *Context:* The first "Verify Documents" is a physical check done at the branch, while the second instance occurs after an internal adjustment and requires re-verification.
   - *Naming Choice:* "Physical Document Verification" denotes the in-person nature of the initial check, while "Post-Adjustment Document Verification" highlights the re-verification step after internal corrections.

This renaming approach ensures that each activity is clearly disambiguated based on its contextual meaning within the process flow.
