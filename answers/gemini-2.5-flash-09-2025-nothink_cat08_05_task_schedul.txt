## Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategy for Precision Parts Inc.

The complex, dynamic nature of Precision Parts Inc.'s job shop—characterized by unique routings, sequence-dependent setups, and frequent disruptions—demands a shift from static local dispatching to a holistic, data-informed scheduling approach. Leveraging the detailed MES event logs via process mining provides the necessary foundation for diagnosis and the development of advanced, adaptive scheduling strategies.

### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

Process mining transforms the chronological event log into structured models of the manufacturing process, allowing for the reconstruction and quantitative analysis of actual shop floor dynamics.

#### Reconstruction and Analysis of Job Flow

We would use **Case Identification (Job ID)** and **Activity Sequencing (Task)**, anchored by **Timestamps** and **Resource ID**, to build individual process instances (job routings). The **Directly Follows Graph (DFG)** or a **Process Map** would visualize the actual, often variant-rich, flow of jobs through the sequence of operations (Cutting $\rightarrow$ Milling $\rightarrow$ Lathe, etc.).

#### Specific Process Mining Techniques and Metrics:

| Metric Category | Process Mining Technique/Metric | Application to Log Data |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flow & Lead Time** | **Cycle Time Analysis** (Net and Total) | Calculate $\text{Task End} - \text{Job Released}$ for total lead time. Analyze duration distributions (mean, variance) for each activity and job variant. |
| **Task Waiting Times** | **Waiting Time Calculation (Time Between Activities)** | Calculate $\text{Task Start} - \text{Previous Task End}$ (or $\text{Queue Entry} - \text{Previous Task End}$) at each machine. Identify major waiting time contributors. |
| **Resource Utilization** | **Resource Performance Analysis** | Measure $\text{Productive Time}$ (Task Start to Task End), $\text{Setup Time}$ (Setup Start to Setup End), and $\text{Idle Time}$ (Total available time - Productive time - Setup time). |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setup** | **Precedence Analysis / Transition Mining** | Analyze the duration between $\text{Setup Start}$ and $\text{Setup End}$ on a specific machine ($\text{CUT-01}$). Correlate this duration with the $\text{Previous job}$ (e.g., $\text{JOB-6998}$) captured in the Notes, and the current job ($\text{JOB-7001}$). Build a quantitative $\text{Setup Matrix}$ detailing $S_{i, j}$ (setup time from job $i$ to job $j$). |
| **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness** | **Conformance Checking / Due Date Analysis** | For completed jobs, compare the $\text{Actual Job Completion Time}$ (final $\text{Task End}$) against the $\text{Order Due Date}$. Calculate $\text{Tardiness} = \max(0, \text{Actual Completion} - \text{Due Date})$. Analyze tardiness distribution by priority and job characteristics. |
| **Impact of Disruptions** | **Event Correlation Analysis** | Identify periods where $\text{Resource Event} = \text{Breakdown Start}$ (e.g., $\text{MILL-02}$). Trace the subsequent queue behavior and calculate the increase in waiting time and flow time for jobs waiting for or subsequently routed away from the failed resource. |

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

By analyzing the metrics derived in Section 1, we can diagnose the systemic failures of the current scheduling approach.

| Pathologies | Evidence from Process Mining Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bottleneck Identification** | **High Waiting Times + High Utilization** (e.g., CUT-01 has 95% utilization and jobs wait an average of 4 hours). Flow analysis shows this machine dictates the pace for the entire shop. |
| **Poor Task Prioritization** | **Priority Inversion:** High-priority jobs (e.g., JOB-7005) exhibit queue waiting times equal to or greater than low-priority jobs, resulting in frequent tardiness for urgent orders. |
| **Suboptimal Sequencing (Setup Waste)** | **Setup Matrix Analysis:** The historical setup matrix reveals that machines frequently transition between jobs requiring maximum setup time (e.g., switching materials, tooling, or temperature settings). This is evidenced by high aggregate setup time (e.g., 25% of resource capacity dedicated to non-productive setup). |
| **Starvation of Downstream Resources** | **Alternating High/Low Utilization Downstream:** Analysis shows a downstream machine (e.g., LATH-02) cycles between periods of high idle time (starvation) followed by short bursts of high utilization, indicating inconsistent upstream job delivery caused by bottlenecks or erratic scheduling at the feeding station. |
| **Unpredictable Lead Times** | **High Variance in Cycle Time:** Cycle time distribution for key activities (e.g., Milling) has a very high standard deviation, proving the current system cannot reliably estimate completion times due to unpredictable queue delays. |

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

The diagnosed pathologies stem from a mismatch between the job shop's complex dynamics and the simplicity of the current scheduling rules (local FCFS/EDD).

* **Limitations of Static Dispatching:** Local rules (FCFS/EDD) only look one step ahead and are *myopic*. They fail to consider the global state (downstream resource load, total remaining processing time) or the cost of the decision (sequence-dependent setup time).
* **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:** The current system ignores the setup cost. A local EDD rule might choose Job A, requiring 90 minutes of setup, over Job B, requiring 5 minutes of setup, even if the processing times are similar and Job B's due date is only slightly later.
* **Inaccurate Time Estimations:** The log reveals discrepancies between $\text{Task Duration (Planned)}$ and $\text{Task Duration (Actual)}$. If the scheduler uses only planned times (often static and optimistic), schedules quickly become invalid, leading to a cascade of delays.
* **Lack of Real-Time Coordination:** The system operates as a collection of isolated queues. If the Milling station bottlenecks, the Cutting station continues to push WIP downstream, exacerbating the queue and increasing flow time.

#### Differentiating Causes using Process Mining:

* **Scheduling Logic vs. Capacity Limitation:**
    * **Capacity Limitation:** If a machine has perpetually high utilization (e.g., > 95%) and jobs constantly wait, the root cause is capacity limitation.
    * **Poor Scheduling Logic:** If a machine has moderate utilization (e.g., 70%), but the queue waiting times are high and volatile, and the setup time ratio is high, the root cause is poor scheduling logic (e.g., bad sequencing leading to wasted setup time, or erratic flow feeding the queue).
* **Variability vs. Mismanagement:**
    * **Inherent Process Variability:** Measured by analyzing the variance in $\text{Task Duration (Actual)}$ for a consistent task.
    * **Mismanagement (Scheduling):** Measured by analyzing the variance in **Waiting Time**, which reflects the erratic nature of the queue management decisions. High waiting time variance suggests poor control over flow.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

The strategies must address the sequence dependence, volatility, and myopic nature of the current system.

#### Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching (EDD-Setup-Lookahead)

This strategy improves local decision-making by incorporating global shop floor intelligence and cost considerations.

*   **Core Logic:** At the moment of machine availability, instead of pure EDD, a composite priority index ($P$) is calculated for every job waiting in the queue. The job with the highest $P$ is selected.
    $$P_{i} = w_{1} \cdot (\frac{1}{\text{Tardiness Risk}_{i}}) + w_{2} \cdot (\frac{1}{\text{Setup Time}_{i, \text{last}}}) - w_{3} \cdot (\frac{\text{Downstream Load}_{i}}{\text{Remaining Proc. Time}_{i}})$$
*   **Process Mining Insights Used:**
    *   The $\text{Setup Matrix}$ (Section 1) provides the required $\text{Setup Time}_{i, \text{last}}$ (the cost of switching from the last processed job to job $i$).
    *   Historical job flow (DFG) is used to estimate $\text{Downstream Load}_{i}$.
    *   Tardiness data informs the weighting factor $w_{1}$ and the calculation of $\text{Tardiness Risk}_{i}$ (e.g., $\text{Remaining Float} / \text{Expected Remaining Lead Time}$).
*   **Addresses Pathologies:** Specifically addresses poor prioritization and suboptimal sequencing by penalizing high-setup jobs unless they are critically late.
*   **Expected Impact:** Reduced overall setup time (due to sequencing consideration) and lower tardiness for high-priority jobs.

#### Strategy 2: Predictive Schedule Generation and Recalibration (Digital Twin Lite)

This strategy moves beyond simple dispatching to generate and actively manage a globally coordinated, time-phased schedule, accounting for predicted volatility.

*   **Core Logic:** Use the historical time distributions (task times, setup times, breakdown frequencies) mined from the log to model the shop floor as a network of queues. A finite capacity scheduling algorithm (like Shifting Bottleneck or Constraint Programming) generates the initial schedule, but unlike traditional static APS, it uses predicted completion times (including expected queue time variance) rather than deterministic planned times.
*   **Process Mining Insights Used:**
    *   **Stochastic Task Times:** Use the actual observed distributions of $\text{Task Duration (Actual)}$ (e.g., Weibull distribution parameterized by job complexity, operator, and resource) rather than the planned mean.
    *   **Breakdown Frequency:** Mine $\text{Resource Event}$ data to model MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) and MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) for critical machines, informing risk buffers in the schedule.
    *   **Proactive Recalibration:** When a task significantly deviates (e.g., $\text{Actual Duration}$ > 1.5 $\times$ $\text{Predicted Duration}$), the MES logs the deviation. This triggers a process mining monitor which flags the schedule as invalid, initiating a partial or full rescheduling event.
*   **Addresses Pathologies:** Drastically reduces unpredictable lead times and high WIP by introducing realistic buffer times and actively responding to disruptions or deviations, improving schedule adherence.
*   **Expected Impact:** Highly accurate lead time predictions and reduced bullwhip effect in WIP.

#### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization via Intelligent Batching at Bottlenecks

This strategy focuses on maximizing throughput at identified critical bottleneck resources (e.g., CNC Milling) by optimizing job sequencing solely based on minimizing non-productive time.

*   **Core Logic:** At the bottleneck resource, the scheduler overrides the general dispatching rule and implements a dynamic batching strategy (e.g., using a Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) heuristic applied to the setup matrix). Jobs are batched based on common tooling, material type, or required temperature settings derived from the setup matrix analysis. A batch is released only when the first job in the batch is due within a certain time horizon ($T_{\text{horizon}}$).
*   **Process Mining Insights Used:**
    *   **Bottleneck Identification:** Confirms the resource requiring optimization (high utilization/waiting time).
    *   **Setup Cost Matrix:** Provides the exact cost function for the TSP heuristic, ensuring the optimal sequence is chosen for the current batch.
    *   **Batch Triggers:** Historical data on successful job clustering (revealed by transition analysis) informs the definition of "similar" jobs and the optimal batch size.
*   **Addresses Pathologies:** Directly tackles inefficient resource utilization caused by sequence-dependent setups, converting non-productive time into throughput.
*   **Expected Impact:** Significant reduction in overall setup time at bottlenecks, leading to higher effective capacity and increased overall shop throughput.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

#### Simulation and Rigorous Evaluation

Discrete-event simulation (DES) is essential for testing these complex, interacting strategies without risking live operations.

1.  **Model Parameterization:** DES models would be parameterized using the distributions mined from the MES log:
    *   **Task/Setup Times:** Use the actual probability distributions (not just means) for duration and setup (Section 4, Strategy 2).
    *   **Arrival Rate:** Use the observed job release pattern and volume.
    *   **Routing Logic:** Use the actual DFG/Process Map to define routing probabilities.
    *   **Disruption Models:** Incorporate the mined MTBF/MTTR for critical resources.
2.  **Testing Scenarios:**
    *   **Baseline:** Simulate the current FCFS/EDD strategy.
    *   **High Load Scenario:** Test system stability and WIP control under 10% and 20% increased job arrival rates.
    *   **Disruption Scenario:** Introduce frequent, random breakdowns and urgent (hot) jobs to assess the resilience of the Predictive Scheduling strategy.
    *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Vary the weighting factors ($w_1, w_2, w_3$) in the Enhanced Dispatching rule to find the optimal balance between tardiness and setup cost.
3.  **KPI Comparison:** Measure and compare the performance of the three proposed strategies and the baseline across primary KPIs (Mean Tardiness, Variance of Lead Time, Total Setup Time, Bottleneck Utilization, Mean WIP levels).

#### Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Scheduling is not a one-time fix; it requires continuous adaptation due to shifts in product mix, tooling, or operator expertise.

1.  **KPI Dashboards (Real-Time Monitoring):** Implement dashboards tracking key process mining metrics:
    *   **Control Charts:** Monitor mean waiting time and setup time for bottleneck machines.
    *   **Setup Drift:** Continuously compare the actual measured setup times against the $\text{Setup Matrix}$ used by the scheduler.
2.  **Automated Drift Detection:** Use **Process Mining Monitoring** techniques to automatically identify significant process or performance drift:
    *   **Concept Drift:** If the actual flow of jobs deviates significantly from the expected DFG (e.g., a new alternate route becoming dominant), the system flags a change in the shop's operational environment.
    *   **Performance Drift:** If the mean tardiness exceeds the threshold for two consecutive weeks, or if the utilization of a non-bottleneck machine spikes, the system triggers an alert.
3.  **Adaptive Scheduling Logic:**
    *   If the monitoring reveals that the weighting factor $w_{2}$ (setup penalty) in Strategy 1 is leading to too many late jobs (high tardiness), the system automatically suggests increasing $w_{1}$ (tardiness risk importance) to rebalance the decision criteria.
    *   If the underlying process distributions (e.g., task time) shift due to new machinery, the process mining pipeline re-calculates the parameters, and the Predictive Scheduler is automatically retrained and recalibrated, ensuring the system remains anchored in the current reality of the shop floor.
