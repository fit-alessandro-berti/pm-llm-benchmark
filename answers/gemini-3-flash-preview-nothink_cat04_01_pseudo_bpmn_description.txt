This pseudo-BPMN represents a **Customer Order Fulfillment Process**. It manages the lifecycle of a request from initial receipt to final confirmation, distinguishing between routine "Standard" orders and complex "Custom" orders.

Below is a detailed breakdown of the process components, logic, and flow.

---

### 1. Initial Processing (Task A and the First Gateway)
The process begins with **Task A: "Receive Customer Request."** This is the data-entry phase where the customer's needs are captured.

*   **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type:** This is an **Exclusive Gateway**. It acts as a decision point where only one of two paths can be taken based on the nature of the request.
    *   **The Standard Path:** Chosen for routine orders with predefined specifications.
    *   **The Custom Path:** Chosen for bespoke orders requiring technical or commercial evaluation.

---

### 2. Path A: The Standard Request Flow
If the request is "Standard," the process focuses on speed and logistics:

*   **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation":** A routine check to ensure the order meets basic criteria.
*   **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks":** This is a **Parallel Gateway**. It splits the process into two concurrent branches that happen at the same time to save time:
    *   **Task C1: Credit Check:** Verifying the customer’s ability to pay.
    *   **Task C2: Inventory Check:** Ensuring the items are in stock.
*   **Parallel Join:** The process waits until **both** C1 and C2 are finished before moving forward.
*   **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date":** Once credit and stock are confirmed, the system determines when the customer will receive the goods.

---

### 3. Path B: The Custom Request Flow
If the request is "Custom," the process focuses on viability and pricing:

*   **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis":** Engineers or specialists determine if the company has the technical capability to fulfill the request.
*   **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?":**
    *   **[No Path]:** Leads to **Task E2 (Send Rejection Notice)** and the process ends immediately. This is a "fail-fast" mechanism to avoid wasting resources on impossible orders.
    *   **[Yes Path]:** Leads to **Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation)**, where a specific price is calculated for the unique request.

---

### 4. Convergence and Approval Logic
After either Task D (Standard) or Task E1 (Custom) is completed, the paths converge at a decision point regarding oversight.

*   **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?":** Not every order requires a manager's signature. This likely depends on business rules (e.g., orders over $10,000 or highly complex custom designs).
    *   **[If No]:** The process skips directly to **Task G (Generate Final Invoice)**.
    *   **[If Yes]:** The process triggers **Task F (Obtain Manager Approval)**.

---

### 5. Rework and Loops (The Feedback Cycle)
If a manager reviews the order (Task F), they reach another **XOR Gateway: "Is Approval Granted?"**

*   **If Approved (Yes):** The process moves to **Task G (Generate Final Invoice)**.
*   **If Rejected (No):** The process triggers **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions."** This is a **Rework Step**.
    *   **The Loop Back:** Instead of ending the process, Task H sends the workflow backward to fix the issues:
        *   Standard orders go back to **Task D** (perhaps to find a better delivery date).
        *   Custom orders go back to **Task E1** (perhaps to adjust the price or quote).

---

### 6. Finalization (Tasks G and I)
Once all validations, feasibility checks, and approvals are satisfied:

*   **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice":** The financial document is created.
*   **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer":** The final step where the customer is notified that their request is processed and confirmed.
*   **End Event:** The process is successfully completed.

### Summary Table: Key Differences

| Feature | Standard Request | Custom Request |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Efficiency & Logistics | Feasibility & Pricing |
| **Workflow Style** | Parallel (C1 & C2 happen together) | Sequential (Check feasibility first) |
| **Risk Handling** | Assumed feasible; checks stock/credit | May be rejected immediately (Task E2) |
| **Rework Target** | Delivery Date calculation (Task D) | Quotation preparation (Task E1) |

### Understanding the Gateways
1.  **XOR (Exclusive):** A fork in the road. You can only go one way (e.g., Standard **OR** Custom).
2.  **AND (Parallel):** A synchronization point. Everything must happen (Credit Check **AND** Inventory Check) before the process continues.
3.  **Loop:** A return to a previous state to correct errors identified during the "Approval" phase.
