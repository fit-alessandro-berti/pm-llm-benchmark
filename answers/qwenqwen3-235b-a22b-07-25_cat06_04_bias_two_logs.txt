The **event log for Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits **systematic bias** in favor of applicants from that group, particularly those who are **Local Residents** and members of the **Highland Civic Darts Club**. This bias manifests through **differential treatment in scoring**, specifically via **unjustified score adjustments**, leading to **more favorable outcomes** for Group B applicants despite comparable or even lower initial qualifications than Group A applicants.

---

###  **Key Observations and Evidence of Bias**

#### 1. **Score Adjustment Based on Group Membership**
- **Group A (Protected Group)**: No score adjustments are applied. All cases (P001, P002, P003) retain their preliminary scores throughout the process.
  - Example: P003 has a score of **740** and is approved; P002 has **710** and is rejected.
  - No mention of community affiliation or local residency leading to boosts.

- **Group B (Unprotected Group)**: Two of the three cases receive a **+10 "Community Boost"**:
  - **U001**: Preliminary score = 720  Final score = **730**  **Approved**
  - **U003**: Preliminary score = 695  Final score = **705**  **Approved**
  - This adjustment is explicitly labeled as **“Community Boost”** and is applied only when the applicant belongs to the **Highland Civic Darts Club** and is a **Local Resident**.

> **U002**, who is a local resident but **not** part of the Darts Club, receives **no adjustment** and is **rejected** despite having a higher preliminary score (710) than U003 (695).

#### 2. **Threshold Effect and Outcome Disparity**
- The **approval threshold** appears to be around **700–710**.
  - **P002 (Group A)**: Score = 710  **Rejected**
  - **U003 (Group B)**: Score = **695  705 after boost**  **Approved**

This is a **critical disparity**: an applicant in Group A with a **higher base score (710)** is rejected, while an applicant in Group B with a **lower base score (695)** is approved due to an **arbitrary adjustment**.

#### 3. **LocalResident and CommunityGroup as Proxy for Favoritism**
- All Group B applicants are **Local Residents**.
- The **"Community Boost"** is only applied when the applicant is both a **Local Resident** and a **member of the Highland Civic Darts Club**.
- This creates a **closed loop of preferential treatment** for a specific social subgroup, which is **absent in Group A** processing.

> Group A applicants receive **no equivalent benefit** for any community involvement or residency status, even though these attributes are recorded (e.g., P001–P003 have `LocalResident = FALSE`, but no policy suggests this should disadvantage them).

#### 4. **Timing and Process Differences**
- Manual review in **Group B** cases occurs **earlier** relative to application receipt than in Group A:
  - U001: 18 min after receipt vs. P001: 20 min
  - U003: 19.5 min vs. P003: 20 min
- While minor, this suggests **prioritization or faster routing** for Group B, especially when combined with score adjustments.

###  Summary of Decision Outcomes

| Case  | Group | Prelim Score | Adjustment | Final Score | Decision   |
|-------|-------|--------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| P001  | A     | 720          | 0          | 720         | Approved   |
| P002  | A     | 710          | 0          | 710         | Rejected   |
| P003  | A     | 740          | 0          | 740         | Approved   |
| U001  | B     | 720          | +10        | 730         | Approved   |
| U002  | B     | 710          | 0          | 710         | Rejected   |
| U003  | B     | 695          | +10        | 705         | Approved   |

> **Notable**: U003 (705) is approved while P002 (710) is rejected — a **reverse outcome** despite a **higher score**, indicating a **bias in scoring rules**.

###  Conclusion: **Bias in Group B’s Processing**

While **Group A is processed neutrally**, **Group B benefits from an informal, non-transparent scoring advantage** tied to **community membership and residency**. This creates a **systematic bias** that:

1. **Favors a specific social subgroup** (local residents in a particular club),
2. **Distorts objective scoring**, and
3. **Leads to inequitable outcomes** compared to the protected group.

This is a classic case of **affinity bias** — where decision systems (or actors) unconsciously or intentionally favor individuals from familiar or socially proximate groups.

---

###  Recommendations

1. **Standardize scoring rules** across all applicants, eliminating unapproved "boosts".
2. **Audit all adjustment factors** for fairness and relevance to risk/eligibility.
3. **Ensure transparency** in how community or residency status affects decisions.
4. **Monitor for disparate impact** between protected and unprotected groups.
5. **Blind review processes** where possible to reduce social bias.

###  Final Answer:
> **The Group B (Unprotected Group) event log exhibits bias.**  
> This bias manifests through the **application of a "+10 Community Boost"** to applicants who are **Local Residents** and members of the **Highland Civic Darts Club**, resulting in **favorable score adjustments and approvals** for lower-scoring applicants, while **equivalent or higher-scoring applicants in Group A receive no such benefit and are rejected**. This leads to **systematic inequity** in final decisions, violating principles of fairness and equal treatment.
