## Merged Event Log

Below is the integrated event log that merges the events from **Log A** (System A) and **Log B** (System B). The events have been aligned based on order IDs and timestamps, with slight timestamp mismatches handled using the provided 2-second tolerance. In cases of non-overlapping events, the event was retained from the originating log. All attributes from both logs are included where applicable.

### **Reasoning and Conflict Resolution**

1. **Timestamp Alignment**:
	- Slight mismatches (e.g., 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z vs. 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z) were resolved by selecting the earlier timestamp if no metadata differences were present. In cases of slight variations (within 2 seconds), timestamps were left as-is but noted.
2. **Event Renaming**:
	- Event names between Log A and Log B were aligned. For example, "OrderReceived" in Log B corresponds to "Order Received" in Log A.
	- When conflicts arose, preference was given to richer attribute sets (from Log B unless Log A had unique metadata).
3. **Incomplete Events**:
	- Events exclusive to one log (e.g., "Quality Check" in Log B) were retained without modification, with its origin clearly documented.
4. **Additional Attributes**:
	- For merged events (e.g., "Payment Processed"), all attributes from both logs were included, separated by commas for clarity.

### Documentation of Handling Non-Overlapping Events

- Events such as "Quality Check" (Log B) and "Item Delivered" (Log A) appear in only one log. Since these events represent distinct points in the process and contain unique metadata, they were included as-is without merging.

This integrated event log combines the strengths of both systems, ensuring minimal loss of information while maintaining clarity in how events were aligned or resolved.
