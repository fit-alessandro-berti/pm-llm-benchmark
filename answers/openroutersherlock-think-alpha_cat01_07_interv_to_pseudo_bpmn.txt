### BPMN-Like Textual Description
This Mermaid diagram renders a BPMN 2.0-compliant process model (copy-paste into Mermaid.live for visualization). It consolidates all interviews into a single coherent model, prioritizing the "happy path" from Mary's account while integrating perspectives from others. Key consolidations:
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check/Log  Purchasing Confirm  Match  Manager Approve  Pay (core flow agreed across Mary, Dan, Carlos).
- **Gateways:** Exclusive (diamonds) for binary decisions (PO valid? Matches? Approve?).
- **Roles/Swimlanes:** Dedicated lanes for primary roles; exception roles as subgraphs (dashed flows indicate ad-hoc involvement).
- **Exceptions/Variations:** Branched paths with loops (e.g., supplier rework, escalations to Rita/Karen). Noted rarity (e.g., Carlos: "once every couple months").
- **Artifacts:** Implicit (Invoice/PO flow via tasks/emails/system).
- **Ambiguities Resolved:** 
  - Receipt confirmation & matching overlap (Dan focuses on PO match; Mary on receipt/match); sequenced as Purchasing first.
  - No PO: Loop to supplier (all agree); Rita handles retrospective cases.
  - Escalations: Modeled as gateways to Rita (Mary/Rita), with Karen optional in discrepancy sub-process.
- **No Parallelism:** All sequential; no XOR/AND gateways beyond exclusives.

This model is directly convertible to BPMN tools (e.g., Camunda Modeler, bpmn.io) by mapping nodes/flows. Total variants: ~4 main paths (happy, no PO, discrepancy, reject).
