To determine the root causes of performance issues specific to your process and data, we should consider several aspects derived from the variants and their frequencies and performance values. Here are some insights:

1. **Rejection and Re-submission Cycles**:
    - Variants with repeated rejections by multiple parties (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER) and subsequent re-submissions contribute significantly to higher performance (time). For instance:
        - Variant 12: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` has a very high performance time of 2,542,497.917 and frequency of 36.
        - Variant 34: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` has a significant performance time of 3,502,608.25 and frequency of 4.

2. **Involvement of Additional Approval Steps**:
    - Adding extra approval steps (e.g., BUDGET OWNER) tends to increase the overall performance time. For example:
        - Variant 2: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` has a performance time of 1,084,338.407, which is significantly higher compared to simpler variants like:
        - Variant 1: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` which has a performance time of 810,187.903.

3. **Rejection by Different Approvers**:
    - Rejections at various stages lead to delays. Specific roles, such as ADMINISTRATION and SUPERVISOR, contribute to increased performance time when they reject declarations, especially if these actions result in multiple loops:
        - Variant 20: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` has a performance time of 1,227,602.318.

4. **High-Frequency Low-Performance Variants**:
    - Some variants have a low frequency but extremely high performance times suggesting unique but severe cases of inefficiency:
        - Variant 33: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled` has an unusually high performance time of 9,110,508.000, although the frequency is just 4.

### Summary of Root Causes

1. **Repeated Rejections and Re-submissions**: Variants featuring cycles of rejection by ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, or other roles, followed by resubmissions substantially increase the process time.
2. **Additional Approval Steps**: Introducing additional approval steps, such as BUDGET OWNER or PRE_APPROVER, significantly prolongs the overall time.
3. **Role-Specific Delays**: Actions taken by specific roles (e.g., ADMINISTRATION or SUPERVISOR) have marked effects on performance time, especially when involving rejection.
4. **Complex Variants**: Some complex paths, despite their lower frequency, account for disproportionately high performance time due to multiple nested loops involving rejections and re-approvals.

Addressing these points can lead to improved process performance by focusing on reducing iterative rejections, streamlining the approval process, and simplifying the declarative paths.
