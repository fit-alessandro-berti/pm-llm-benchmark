Below is the analysis of each case compared with the normative process, along with explanations of any deviations found.

### **Case-by-Case Analysis**

#### **Case 1**

- **Sequence Recorded:**  
  1. Receive order  
  2. Check inventory  
  3. Authorize payment  
  4. Package items  
  5. Ship order  
  6. Close order  

- **Evaluation:**  
  This case perfectly follows the expected flow for an order with sufficient inventory. The order of activities adheres to the normative sequence:
  - **Receive → Check → Authorize Payment → Package → Ship → Close**

- **Conclusion:**  
  **No violation.**

---

#### **Case 2**

- **Sequence Recorded:**  
  1. Receive order  
  2. Check inventory  
  3. Package items  
  4. Authorize payment  
  5. Ship order  
  6. Close order  

- **Evaluation:**  
  According to the normative description, once inventory is checked, the **Authorize payment** step must occur before any fulfillment activity (i.e. **Package items**). In this case, the activity **Package items** occurs at 10:00, and **Authorize payment** is delayed until 10:30, reversing the required order.
  
- **Violation Identified:**  
  - **Incorrect ordering:** Packaging is done **before** payment authorization, violating the rule that **"Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging.**

- **Conclusion:**  
  **Case 2 violates the normative process.**

#### **Case 3**

- **Sequence Recorded:**  
  1. Receive order  
  2. Check inventory  
  3. Authorize payment  
  4. Cancel order  
  5. Ship order  
  6. Close order  

- **Evaluation:**  
  The normative guidelines clearly distinguish between the two branches:
  
  - **Fulfillment branch (sufficient inventory):** Should follow the sequence: **Receive → Check → Authorize Payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order.**
  - **Cancellation branch (insufficient inventory):** Should follow the sequence: **Receive → Check → Cancel order → Close order.**
  
  In Case 3, after **Check inventory** and **Authorize payment**, a **Cancel order** activity is executed. This suggests that the inventory was insufficient. However, the process then continues with a **Ship order** activity after cancellation. According to the normative process, once an order is cancelled, further fulfillment actions such as shipping should not occur.
  
- **Violations Identified:**  
  - **Branch mixing:** The process mixes activities from both the fulfillment and cancellation branches.  
  - **Shipping after cancellation:** **"Ship order"** is recorded **after** a **"Cancel order"**, which is explicitly against the rule that shipping should never occur following a cancellation.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Case 3 violates the normative process.**

---

#### **Case 4**

- **Sequence Recorded:**  
  1. Receive order  
  2. Check inventory  
  3. Cancel order  
  4. Close order  

- **Evaluation:**  
  This case reflects the proper cancellation branch:
  - After the order is received and inventory checked, the process moves directly to cancellation, then closes the order.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **No violation.**

---

#### **Case 5**

- **Sequence Recorded:**  
  1. Receive order  
  2. Check inventory  
  3. Authorize payment  
  4. Ship order  
  5. Close order  

- **Evaluation:**  
  For orders with sufficient inventory, the normative process requires the following sequence:
  - **Receive → Check → Authorize Payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order.**
  
  In Case 5, the **Package items** step is entirely missing before shipping. Since the packaging is necessary to prepare items for shipment, omitting this step deviates from the normative process.
  
- **Violation Identified:**  
  - **Missing step:** The absence of **"Package items"** violates the requirement that packaging must occur after payment authorization and before shipping.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Case 5 violates the normative process.**

---

### **Summary of Violations**

- **Case 2:**  
  - **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."  
  - **Normative Expectation:** Payment authorization must come **before** packaging.

- **Case 3:**  
  - **Violations:**  
    - The process mixes branches by performing both fulfillment and cancellation steps.  
    - "Ship order" is executed **after** "Cancel order."  
  - **Normative Expectation:** If an order is cancelled (i.e., after insufficient inventory), the process should not proceed with fulfillment activities (like shipping); the correct flow is "Cancel order" then "Close order."

- **Case 5:**  
  - **Violation:** The required "Package items" step is missing before shipping the order.  
  - **Normative Expectation:** For orders with sufficient inventory, after "Authorize payment" the items must be packaged before they can be shipped.

---

### **Final Answer**

The cases that deviate from the normative process are **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5**. 

- **Case 2** violates the expected order by packaging items before authorizing payment.
- **Case 3** improperly mixes the cancellation branch with fulfillment activities, shipping the order after it has been cancelled.
- **Case 5** is missing the mandatory "Package items" step before shipping.

Each of these deviations conflicts with the process rules outlined in the normative description.
