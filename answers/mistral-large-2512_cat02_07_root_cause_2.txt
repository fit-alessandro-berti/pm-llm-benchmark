### **1. Identifying Cases with Long Durations**
First, let's calculate the **total duration** (from "Submit Claim" to "Close Claim") for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time          | End Time            | Duration (hours) | Notes                          |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00    | 2024-04-01 10:30    | **1.5**          | Fast completion                |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05    | 2024-04-02 11:00    | **25.9**         | 1-day delay (next-day approval)|
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10    | 2024-04-03 09:30    | **48.3**         | **2-day delay**                |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20    | 2024-04-01 10:45    | **1.4**          | Fast completion                |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25    | 2024-04-04 14:30    | **77.1**         | **3-day delay**                |

**Observations:**
- **Cases 2003 and 2005** have **significantly longer durations** (48.3 and 77.1 hours, respectively).
- **Case 2002** also has a delay (25.9 hours) but is less severe.
- **Cases 2001 and 2004** complete quickly (~1.5 hours).

### **2. Analyzing Root Causes of Long Durations**
We now examine the **attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity)** to identify patterns in delayed cases.

#### **A. Complexity Level**
| Case ID | Complexity | Duration (hours) | Additional Docs Requested? | Notes                          |
|---------|------------|------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2001    | Low        | 1.5              | No                         | Fast                           |
| 2002    | Medium     | 25.9             | Yes (1 request)            | 1-day delay                    |
| 2003    | High       | 48.3             | Yes (2 requests)           | 2-day delay                    |
| 2004    | Low        | 1.4              | No                         | Fast                           |
| 2005    | High       | 77.1             | Yes (3 requests)           | **3-day delay**                |

**Observations:**
- **High-complexity cases (2003, 2005) take the longest**, with **multiple requests for additional documents**.
- **Medium-complexity cases (2002) have moderate delays**, with **one request for additional docs**.
- **Low-complexity cases (2001, 2004) complete quickly** with **no additional docs requested**.

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- **Complexity is a major driver of delays** because:
  - High-complexity claims require **more documentation**, leading to **multiple back-and-forth requests**.
  - Each request adds **waiting time** (e.g., customer response time, re-evaluation).
  - **Approvals and payments take longer** for complex cases (e.g., Case 2005 took **3 days** after the last doc request).

#### **B. Region**
| Case ID | Region | Duration (hours) | Complexity | Notes                          |
|---------|--------|------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| 2001    | A      | 1.5              | Low        | Fast                           |
| 2003    | A      | 48.3             | High       | 2-day delay                    |
| 2002    | B      | 25.9             | Medium     | 1-day delay                    |
| 2004    | B      | 1.4              | Low        | Fast                           |
| 2005    | B      | 77.1             | High       | **3-day delay**                |

**Observations:**
- **Both regions (A and B) have delayed cases**, but **Region B has the longest delay (Case 2005)**.
- **Region A’s delay (Case 2003) is shorter than Region B’s worst case (2005)**.
- **Low-complexity cases in both regions complete quickly**.

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- **Region B may have slower processing** for high-complexity cases, possibly due to:
  - **Fewer resources** (e.g., only **Adjuster_Lisa** handles high-complexity cases in Region B).
  - **Different approval workflows** (e.g., **Manager_Bill** in Region A vs. **Manager_Ann** in Region B).
  - **Geographic or operational inefficiencies** (e.g., time zone differences, local regulations).

#### **C. Resource**
| Case ID | Resource (Adjuster) | Resource (Manager) | Duration (hours) | Complexity | Notes                          |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| 2001    | Adjuster_Mike       | Manager_Ann        | 1.5              | Low        | Fast                           |
| 2002    | Adjuster_Lisa       | Manager_Ann        | 25.9             | Medium     | 1-day delay                    |
| 2003    | Adjuster_Mike       | Manager_Bill       | 48.3             | High       | 2-day delay                    |
| 2004    | Adjuster_Lisa       | Manager_Ann        | 1.4              | Low        | Fast                           |
| 2005    | Adjuster_Lisa       | Manager_Bill       | 77.1             | High       | **3-day delay**                |

**Observations:**
- **Adjuster_Lisa** handles **both delayed cases (2002, 2005)** but also a fast case (2004).
- **Adjuster_Mike** handles **one delayed case (2003)** and one fast case (2001).
- **Manager_Bill** is involved in **both longest delays (2003, 2005)**.
- **Manager_Ann** is involved in **faster cases (2001, 2002, 2004)**.

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- **Manager_Bill may be a bottleneck** (slower approvals for high-complexity cases).
- **Adjuster_Lisa is overloaded** (handles all high-complexity cases in Region B, leading to delays).
- **Adjuster_Mike** is **more efficient** (Case 2003 is delayed but not as badly as 2005).

### **3. Summary of Root Causes**
| Root Cause               | Evidence                                                                 | Impact on Duration |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **High Complexity**      | Cases 2003 & 2005 (High) have **multiple doc requests** and longest delays. | **Major**          |
| **Region B Inefficiencies** | Region B’s high-complexity case (2005) takes **3 days** vs. 2 days in Region A. | **Moderate**       |
| **Resource Bottlenecks** | - **Manager_Bill** approves slowly (Cases 2003, 2005).<br>- **Adjuster_Lisa** is overloaded (Region B). | **Moderate**       |

### **4. Recommendations to Mitigate Delays**
#### **A. Reduce Delays from High Complexity**
- **Automate document collection** (e.g., integrate with customer portals to reduce back-and-forth).
- **Pre-define required documents** for high-complexity claims to minimize requests.
- **Assign dedicated adjusters** for high-complexity cases to speed up evaluations.

#### **B. Improve Region B Performance**
- **Hire/train more adjusters** in Region B to distribute workload (e.g., reduce reliance on Adjuster_Lisa).
- **Standardize approval workflows** across regions (e.g., ensure Manager_Bill follows the same SLA as Manager_Ann).
- **Investigate regional inefficiencies** (e.g., time zone delays, local regulations).

#### **C. Optimize Resource Allocation**
- **Balance workload** (e.g., assign some high-complexity cases in Region B to Adjuster_Mike).
- **Train Manager_Bill** on faster approvals or **assign a backup manager** for high-complexity cases.
- **Monitor adjuster performance** (e.g., track average handling time per complexity level).

#### **D. Process Improvements**
- **Implement SLA targets** (e.g., "High-complexity cases must be approved within 24 hours of final doc submission").
- **Use predictive analytics** to flag high-risk cases early (e.g., cases likely to need multiple doc requests).
- **Improve customer communication** (e.g., automated reminders for pending documents).

### **5. Final Answer**
**Cases with Performance Issues:**
- **Case 2003** (48.3 hours) and **Case 2005** (77.1 hours) are the **most delayed**.
- **Case 2002** (25.9 hours) has a **moderate delay**.

**Root Causes of Long Durations:**
1. **High Complexity**  **Multiple document requests** (major factor).
2. **Region B Inefficiencies**  **Slower processing** for high-complexity cases (e.g., reliance on a single adjuster).
3. **Resource Bottlenecks**  **Manager_Bill’s slow approvals** and **Adjuster_Lisa’s overload** in Region B.

**Recommendations:**
- **Automate document collection** for high-complexity cases.
- **Hire/train more adjusters** in Region B.
- **Standardize approval workflows** across regions.
- **Monitor and balance adjuster workloads**.
- **Implement SLAs** for high-complexity cases.

By addressing these root causes, the insurance claims process can become **faster and more consistent**.
