This is a business process diagram (BPMN - Business Process Model and Notation) that illustrates a shipping and logistics workflow across three swim lanes representing different departments or roles:

**Swim Lanes:**
1. **Logistics** (top)
2. **Distribution center, communicates Express Shop, Secretary** (middle)
3. **Warehouse** (bottom)

**Process Flow:**

The process begins with "Ship goods" and follows these key steps:

1. **Clarify shipment method** - determines if special handling is required
2. If special handling is needed:
   - Check if insurance is required (with customer information database connection)
   - Write package label
   - Get 3 offers from logistic companies
   - Select logistic company and place order
3. The flow then merges and continues to:
   - Package goods (with a 48-hour timer)
   - Notify customer about delay (if applicable)
   - Fill out shipment paperwork
   - Move package to pickup area

**Key Elements:**
- Diamond shapes represent decision points (gateways)
- Rectangles represent tasks/activities
- The cylinder represents a database (Customer information)
- The timer symbol (clock) indicates a time constraint
- Arrows show the flow direction
- The "Insure parcel" activity appears at the top as a subprocess

The diagram effectively maps out a complete shipping process from initial order through to final pickup preparation, showing the interactions between different departments and decision points along the way.
