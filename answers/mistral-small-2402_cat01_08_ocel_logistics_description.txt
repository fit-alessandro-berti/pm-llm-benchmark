Based on the provided data, here is a general description of the process:

1. Customers place orders for items. Each order is associated with one customer.
2. After an order is placed, it gets confirmed. This confirmation may result in items being picked if they are in stock. If an item is out of stock, a reorder request is initiated.
3. Picked items are used to create packages. Each package can contain items from multiple orders.
4. Packages are then sent to the customers. Once a package is delivered, the payment for the order is processed.
5. If the payment is not received on time, a payment reminder is sent to the customer.
6. Employees are involved in the process of picking items and handling reorders. There seems to be a small team of employees (7) handling these tasks.
7. The process also includes instances where orders are paid before items are picked, or items are picked without an order being placed. These could be exceptional cases or errors in the data.
