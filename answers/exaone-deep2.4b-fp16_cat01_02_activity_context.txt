Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the existing event log and figure out which activities are recurring within the same case. The main goal is to rename these activities to reflect their contextual differences based on their position and context in the log.

Looking at the first case, C001, the activity "Verify Documents" appears twice. The first occurrence is at 09:20 with BackOfficeAgent checking identity documents. The second time it's at 10:30 with the same agent re-checking after an ID scan was submitted. So the context here changes from initial verification to a re-verification after an additional step. That means the first "Verify Documents" should maybe be "Initial Document Verification" and the second "Re-Verification After ID Scan" or something similar.

Then, looking at C002's "Verify Documents" at 08:15 and then again at 09:20. Wait, in C002, the first Verify Documents is at 08:15 by BackOfficeAgent, and the next one is at 09:30 (Adjust Account) then another Verify at 09:50? Wait no, looking again: C002's events are:

- Verify Documents (08:15)
- Adjust Account (09:30)
- Then another Verify Documents at 09:50? No, let me check again. The C002 events:

Looking at the log for C002:

After Verify Documents at 08:15, then Call Customer, then Adjust Account, then another Call Customer, then Approve. Wait, the next Verify Documents in C002 is after Adjust Account? Wait the third event after Verify Documents is Adjust Account, then another Call Customer, then another Verify Documents at 09:50? Wait no, let me check again:

Wait the C002 events:

1. Initiate Request
2. Verify Documents (08:15)
3. Call Customer (09:00)
4. Adjust Account (09:30)
5. Call Customer (09:50)
6. Approve Request (10:05)

Wait, so the next Verify Documents in C002 is actually not present here. Wait maybe I miscounted. The user's data shows for C002:

After Adjust Account (09:30), there's another Call Customer (09:50), then the next Verify Documents isn't listed here. Wait, looking back at the user's provided log for C002:

The last event in C002's block is "Approve Request". So maybe the second Verify Documents in C002 is only once. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the user's data.

Looking at the user's log for C002:

The events are:

- Initiate Request
- Verify Documents (08:15)
- Call Customer (09:00)
- Adjust Account (09:30)
- Call Customer (09:50)
- Approve Request (10:05)

So "Verify Documents" occurs only once in C002. Hmm, maybe I was confused with C001's second occurrence. Let me check C003.

C003 has "Verify Documents" twice: first at 11:25 and then again at 12:20. The first is by BranchOfficer verifying physical docs, then after an adjustment at 12:05, they re-verify. So similar to C001's case. So "Verify Documents" recurs in C001 (twice) and C003 (twice). 

Other activities like "Call Customer" and "Adjust Account" might also appear in multiple cases but not necessarily within the same case. Let's see:

Looking for activities that occur multiple times within the same case:

In C001: "Verify Documents" twice.

In C003: "Verify Documents" twice.

Other activities in same cases: "Call Customer" appears in C001 (twice?), let's check:

C001 has "Call Customer" at 09:45 and another Call Customer at 09:50? Wait no, looking again:

C001's events:

- Call Customer at 09:45 (FrontlineAgent)
- Then Submit Additional, then Verify Documents again, then another Verify Documents, then Approve. So "Call Customer" only once in C001. Wait, the second call is in C002's Adjust Account step leads to another call? No, in C002's events, after Adjust Account (09:30), there's a Call Customer at 09:50. So "Call Customer" occurs in C002 once. Hmm.

Wait maybe I need to check all cases for activities that repeat within the same case. So:

Case C001: Verify Documents occurs twice. So that's a candidate for renaming.

Case C002: Verify Documents once, so maybe not. Wait, no, in C002's first Verify Documents is at 08:15, then after some steps, maybe another Verify? Let me check again. The C002 log as per user's input:

Looking at the user's C002 events:

After the initial Verify Documents (08:15), the next events are Call Customer, Adjust Account, another Call Customer, then Approve. So "Verify Documents" only once here. So maybe only C001 and C003 have Verify Documents recurring within their own cases.

Wait C003's Verify Documents occurs twice. The first is at 11:25 (BranchOfficer verifying physical docs), then after Adjust Account at 12:05 (BackOfficeAgent adjusting account due to missing info), then another Verify at 12:20 (BranchOfficer re-verifying after adjustment). So that's two times in C003. So that's another recurring activity.

Therefore, the activities that recur within the same case are "Verify Documents" in C001 (twice) and C003 (twice). Additionally, maybe "Call Customer" appears in some cases multiple times? Let me check all cases again.

Looking at all cases:

C001: Call Customer once (09:45)
C002: Call Customer once (09:00)
C003: Call Customer twice (11:50 and 11:50? Wait no, in C003's events:

Looking at C003's events:

- Call Customer at 11:50 (FrontlineAgent)
Wait the events for C003:

1. Initiate Request
2. Verify Documents (11:25)
3. Call Customer (11:50)
4. Adjust Account (12:05)
5. Verify Documents (12:20)
6. Approve Request

So "Call Customer" occurs once in C003. So only in C001 and C003 do "Verify Documents" recur. 

Wait another thing: In C002's Adjust Account event (09:30), then another Call Customer (09:50). Maybe "Call Customer" is part of the workflow but only once per case. So the main recurring activities within the same case are "Verify Documents" in C001 and C003.

Additionally, maybe "Approve Request" occurs in multiple cases? Let's see:

C001 ends with Approve at 10:45.

C002 ends with Approve at 10:05.

C003 ends with Approve at 12:30.

So "Approve Request" occurs in all three cases but that's across different cases, not within the same case. Since the task is to look within the same case, that's okay. The task is to rename activities that appear multiple times within the same case.

Therefore, the main candidates are "Verify Documents" in C001 and C003.

Now, for each of these activities, we need to rename them based on their context in their respective cases.

Starting with C001's "Verify Documents":

First occurrence (09:20): BackOfficeAgent checks identity documents. The context here is the initial verification. So perhaps "Initial Document Verification by BackOfficeAgent".

Second occurrence (10:30): After the customer submitted an ID scan (the Submit Additional event at 10:10), the agent re-checks. The context here is re-verification after an additional step. So maybe "Re-Verification After ID Scan Submission".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification Following ID Scan" or "Re-Verification After Additional Documentation".

Alternatively, perhaps "Re-Verification Due to Additional Documentation".

Alternatively, maybe "Verify Documents (Post-ID Scan)" but that might not be precise. Let's see the exact context of the second Verify Documents event: the note says "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided." So the context is that the ID scan was submitted before this Verify Documents, so the re-verification is because the previous check was done without the scan, and now they need to confirm with the new scan. So the second Verify Documents is a re-verification due to the submission of the ID scan. Therefore, the name should reflect that.

So for C001's first Verify Documents: "Initial Document Verification by BackOfficeAgent".

Second: "Re-Verification After ID Scan Submission by BackOfficeAgent".

Alternatively, maybe "Re-Verification Following ID Scan".

Alternatively, "Post-ID Verification by BackOfficeAgent".

Hmm. Let me think of the exact wording in the additional context. The second Verify Documents event's context is "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided." So the reason is that the ID scan was provided (via the Submit Additional activity at 10:10). Therefore, the re-verification is because the previous check didn't include the scan, and now they need to check again with the new scan. So the context here is "due to the submission of the ID scan".

Therefore, the second Verify Documents could be renamed as "Re-Verification Following ID Scan Submission" or "Re-Verification After ID Scan".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification After Additional Documentation".

Alternatively, "Post-ID Verification".

Hmm. Maybe "Re-Verification Due to New Documentation".

Alternatively, perhaps "Re-Verification Following ID Scan Submission".

I think that's the most precise. Let's go with that.

Now for C003's Verify Documents events:

First occurrence (11:25): BranchOfficer verifies physical documents. The context here is "Physical verification of ID." So perhaps "Physical Document Verification by BranchOfficer".

Second occurrence (12:20): After Adjust Account (which was due to missing info), they re-verify. The context here is "Re-verify docs after account adjustment." So the reason is the account adjustment led to needing a re-verification. So maybe "Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment by BranchOfficer".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification After Account Adjustment".

Alternatively, "Post-Account Adjustment Verification".

Hmm. The exact context for the second Verify Documents in C003 is "Re-verify docs after account adjustment." So the context is that the adjustment was made, so they need to re-verify. Therefore, "Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment by BranchOfficer".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification After Account Adjustment".

Alternatively, "Post-Adjustment Verification".

Hmm. The key is to capture the context that led to the re-verification. Since the adjustment was made because of missing info (the note says "Internal correction due to missing info."), but the re-verification is because of that adjustment. So the context here is "Re-verification after internal account adjustment".

Therefore, the second Verify Documents in C003 would be named "Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment by BranchOfficer".

Alternatively, maybe "Re-Verification After Internal Adjustment".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification Following Account Correction".

Hmm. The exact wording from the log's additional context for C003's second Verify Documents is "Re-verify docs after account adjustment." So the context is "after account adjustment". Therefore, "Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment".

Now, for the other activities that might need renaming. Wait, the problem says "activities that appear multiple times within the same case". Let me check again if there are any others.

Looking at C002's "Adjust Account" occurs once, so no. "Call Customer" once in each case. So the only activities that recur within the same case are "Verify Documents" in C001 (twice) and C003 (twice). 

Wait, what about "Call Customer" in C002? Let me check again. In C002's events:

After Verify Documents (08:15), there's a Call Customer at 09:00. Then Adjust Account, then another Call Customer at 09:50. Wait, no, the events for C002 are:

Looking at the user's data for C002:

After Initiate Request, Verify Documents (08:15), then Call Customer (09:00), then Adjust Account (09:30), then another Call Customer (09:50), then Approve. Wait, so "Call Customer" occurs twice in C002? Wait no, the first Call Customer is at 09:00, then after Adjust Account, there's another Call Customer at 09:50. Wait that's two times in C002. Wait, but the user's log shows:

Looking at the user's C002 events:

| C002    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-02 09:00:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.              |
| C002    | Adjust Account    | 2024-05-02 09:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Adjust account details internally after call.              |
| C002    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-02 09:50:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made.                |

Ah! So in C002, "Call Customer" occurs twice: first at 09:00 and then again at 09:50. Wait, but the second Call Customer is part of the process after the Adjust Account. So in C002, "Call Customer" appears twice within the same case. That's another activity that recurs within the same case. So I missed that earlier. So that's another activity to consider renaming.

Similarly, in C003, "Call Customer" occurs once. But in C002, it's twice. So that's another activity to look at. Let's check the context of those calls.

In C002's first Call Customer (09:00), the context is "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy." Then after Adjust Account (which was due to the discrepancy), the second Call Customer is a follow-up with "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made." So the two Call Customer events in C002 have different contexts: initial outbound call and a follow-up. Therefore, the activity "Call Customer" appears twice in C002, so it should be renamed to reflect the different contexts.

Similarly, in C001, the Call Customer is only once. So the "Call Customer" activity occurs in C002 twice, so it's a recurring activity within the same case. Therefore, this needs to be considered as well.

So now, the activities that recur within the same case are:

- Verify Documents in C001 (twice)
- Verify Documents in C003 (twice)
- Call Customer in C002 (twice)

Additionally, maybe "Adjust Account" occurs once in each case, so no. 

So now, need to process these three activities: Verify Documents (twice in two cases), Call Customer (twice in one case).

Let's start with "Call Customer" in C002. The two occurrences have different contexts:

First Call Customer (09:00): "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy." The context is that they need to ask the customer about the discrepancy found earlier (maybe during the Verify Documents step? Or perhaps the Adjust Account was done based on the discrepancy found in the first call). The call is to clarify the account discrepancy.

Second Call Customer (09:50): "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made." The adjustments were made (Adjust Account at 09:30), so the follow-up is to confirm that the adjustments are correct and to confirm the customer's agreement.

Therefore, the two instances of "Call Customer" in C002 have different purposes: one to investigate a discrepancy, the other to confirm the adjustments. Thus, the activity should be renamed to "Outbound Call to Investigate Discrepancy" and "Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustments". But since we need a single name for the activity, perhaps "Outbound Investigative Call" and "Follow-Up Verification Call", but since they are two different contexts within the same case, maybe the activity name needs to be split? But the problem states to rename the activity so that their names reflect context. Since the activity is the same name but different context, perhaps we can have two instances with different names, but the problem says "rename them so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences". So perhaps the activity name should be adjusted to include the context, but since it's within the same case, maybe the activity name itself is changed to indicate the different uses. Alternatively, perhaps the activity name can be split into two different activities, but the problem says to rename the existing activities. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the activity name can be modified to include a description that differentiates the instances. For example, "Outbound Call to Investigate" and "Follow-Up Call to Confirm". But since the problem says to rename the activity (singular), maybe we can have a single name that incorporates the context, but that might not be clear. Alternatively, perhaps the activity name is kept but with a note, but the problem requires renaming the activity name itself. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the activity "Call Customer" can be renamed to "Investigative Outbound Call" for the first instance and "Follow-Up Verification Call" for the second. But since each case has only one instance of each activity, except for the two in C002, perhaps the activity name must be adjusted so that in C002, the two instances have different names. But the problem might expect that the same activity name is kept but with a more precise name that captures the context. Alternatively, perhaps the activity name can be split into two different activities, but the problem states to rename existing activities, so perhaps the activity name should be changed to something like "Outbound Call to Investigate" and "Follow-Up Call to Confirm", but since they are two different instances in the same case, maybe the activity name should be adjusted to include the context. However, the problem might expect that the activity name is changed to a more specific name that captures the different contexts when they occur. For example, "Investigative Outbound Call" and "Follow-Up Call", but since they are two separate events in the same case, perhaps the activity name can be modified to include the context in the name. Alternatively, perhaps the activity name is kept as "Call Customer" but with a note in the context, but the problem requires renaming the activity name itself. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the activity name is changed to a more specific name that indicates the different contexts. For example, in C002's first Call Customer, the context is "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy", so the activity could be renamed to "Outbound Investigative Call", and the second to "Follow-Up Confirmation Call". Since they are two different instances in the same case, the activity name must be different for each instance. Therefore, the original "Call Customer" activity name is replaced with a more specific name that captures the context when it occurs. Therefore, in C002's first instance, it becomes "Outbound Investigative Call", and the second becomes "Follow-Up Verification Call".

Therefore, the activity name is now more descriptive based on the context in which it occurs within the case.

So for the "Call Customer" activity in C002, the two instances are renamed based on their context.

Now, proceeding with the renaming steps:

First, list all activities that recur within the same case:

1. Verify Documents (C001 x2, C003 x2)
2. Call Customer (C002 x2)

Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with Verify Documents in C001:

First occurrence (09:20):

Original name: Verify Documents
Context: BackOfficeAgent checks identity documents. The first verification after initiating the request. So the name could be "Initial Document Verification by BackOfficeAgent".

Second occurrence (10:30):

Context: After the customer submitted an ID scan (via Submit Additional activity at 10:10), the agent re-checks. The name should reflect that it's a re-verification due to the new scan. So "Re-Verification Following ID Scan Submission by BackOfficeAgent".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification After ID Scan" or "Re-Verification Following Additional Documentation".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification Post-ID Scan".

Hmm. The exact context from the log's additional context is "now that ID scan is provided." So "Re-Verification After ID Scan Submission".

So the first becomes "Initial Document Verification by BackOfficeAgent", the second "Re-Verification Following ID Scan Submission by BackOfficeAgent".

Next, Verify Documents in C003:

First occurrence (11:25):

Original name: Verify Documents
Context: BranchOfficer verifies physical documents. The first verification is physical. So "Physical Document Verification by BranchOfficer".

Second occurrence (12:20):

After Adjust Account (due to missing info), they re-verify. The context is "Re-verify docs after account adjustment". So "Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment by BranchOfficer".

Alternatively, "Re-Verification After Internal Adjustment".

Hmm. The exact context is "Re-verify docs after account adjustment." So "Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment by BranchOfficer".

Now, the Call Customer activity in C002:

First occurrence (09:00):

Context: Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy. So "Outbound Investigative Call to Clarify Discrepancy".

Second occurrence (09:50):

Context: Follow-up call to confirm adjustments. So "Follow-Up Verification Call to Confirm Adjustments".

Alternatively, "Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustments".

These names capture the different purposes of the calls.

Now, applying these renames to the event log.

Let's reconstruct the revised log with these changes.

Starting with C001:

Original events:

| C001    | Initiate Request  | 2024-05-01 09:15:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C001    | Verify Documents  | 2024-05-01 09:20:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent checks identity documents.                           |
| C001    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-01 09:45:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs. |
| C001    | Submit Additional | 2024-05-01 10:10:00 | CustomerSelfServe| Customer uploads the requested ID scan.                    |
| C001    | Verify Documents  | 2024-05-01 10:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided.    |
| C001    | Approve Request   | 2024-05-01 10:45:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

After renaming Verify Documents events:

First Verify Documents becomes "Initial Document Verification by BackOfficeAgent"

Second becomes "Re-Verification Following ID Scan Submission by BackOfficeAgent"

So the revised C001 events:

| C001    | Initiate Request  | 2024-05-01 09:15:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C001    | Initial Document Verification by BackOfficeAgent  | 2024-05-01 09:20:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent checks identity documents.                           |
| C001    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-01 09:45:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs. |
| C001    | Submit Additional | 2024-05-01 10:10:00 | CustomerSelfServe| Customer uploads the requested ID scan.                    |
| C001    | Re-Verification Following ID Scan Submission by BackOfficeAgent  | 2024-05-01 10:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided.    |
| C001    | Approve Request   | 2024-05-01 10:45:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

Now, moving to C002:

Original events:

| C002    | Initiate Request  | 2024-05-02 08:05:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C002    | Verify Documents  | 2024-05-02 08:15:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Identity verification.                                     |
| C002    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-02 09:00:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.              |
| C002    | Adjust Account    | 2024-05-02 09:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Adjust account details internally after call.              |
| C002    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-02 09:50:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made.                |
| C002    | Approve Request   | 2024-05-02 10:05:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

First Call Customer event (09:00) becomes "Outbound Investigative Call to Clarify Discrepancy"

Second Call Customer (09:50) becomes "Follow-Up Verification Call to Confirm Adjustments"

So revised C002 events:

| C002    | Initiate Request  | 2024-05-02 08:05:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C002    | Verify Documents  | 2024-05-02 08:15:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Identity verification.                                     |
| C002    | Outbound Investigative Call to Clarify Discrepancy  | 2024-05-02 09:00:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.              |
| C002    | Adjust Account    | 2024-05-02 09:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Adjust account details internally after call.              |
| C002    | Follow-Up Verification Call to Confirm Adjustments  | 2024-05-02 09:50:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made.                |
| C002    | Approve Request   | 2024-05-02 10:05:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

Now, C003:

Original events:

| C003    | Initiate Request  | 2024-05-03 11:20:00 | BranchReception  | Walk-in customer at branch.                                |
| C003    | Verify Documents  | 2024-05-03 11:25:00 | BranchOfficer    | Physical verification of ID.                               |
| C003    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-03 11:50:00 | BranchOfficer    | Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return.   |
| C003    | Adjust Account    | 2024-05-03 12:05:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Internal correction due to missing info.                   |
| C003    | Verify Documents  | 2024-05-03 12:20:00 | BranchOfficer    | Re-verify docs after account adjustment.                   |
| C003    | Approve Request   | 2024-05-03 12:30:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

First Verify Documents becomes "Physical Document Verification by BranchOfficer"

Second becomes "Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment by BranchOfficer"

So revised C003 events:

| C003    | Initiate Request  | 2024-05-03 11:20:00 | BranchReception  | Walk-in customer at branch.                                |
| C003    | Physical Document Verification by BranchOfficer  | 2024-05-03 11:25:00 | BranchOfficer    | Physical verification of ID.                               |
| C003    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-03 11:50:00 | BranchOfficer    | Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return.   |
| C003    | Adjust Account    | 2024-05-03 12:05:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Internal correction due to missing info.                   |
| C003    | Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment by BranchOfficer  | 2024-05-03 12:20:00 | BranchOfficer    | Re-verify docs after account adjustment.                   |
| C003    | Approve Request   | 2024-05-03 12:30:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

Now, the problem also mentions other activities that might need renaming. For example, "Submit Additional" is only once, so no need. "Approve Request" occurs in all cases but that's across cases, so okay.

Wait, but the problem says "activities that appear multiple times within the same case". So only the ones we've addressed so far.

Now, the final step is to present the revised log with these changes and justify the names.

Justification for each renamed activity:

1. Initial Document Verification by BackOfficeAgent (C001 first Verify Documents):

   - Context: The first verification occurs immediately after initiating the request, so it's an initial check of the submitted documents. The BackOfficeAgent is the one performing this check, so the name includes both the initial nature and the agent.

2. Re-Verification Following ID Scan Submission by BackOfficeAgent (C001 second Verify Documents):

   - Context: After the customer uploaded an ID scan (via Submit Additional), the agent re-checks documents to ensure all required information (including the new scan) is present. The name reflects the cause (ID scan submission) leading to the re-verification.

3. Physical Document Verification by BranchOfficer (C003 first Verify Documents):

   - Context: This verification involves a physical check of documents, likely in a branch setting where physical IDs are required. The BranchOfficer is the one conducting the check.

4. Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment by BranchOfficer (C003 second Verify Documents):

   - Context: After adjusting the account details due to missing information, the BranchOfficer re-verifies the documents to ensure accuracy post-adjustment. The name captures the adjustment leading to the re-verification.

5. Outbound Investigative Call to Clarify Discrepancy (C002 first Call Customer):

   - Context: The first call is to investigate an account discrepancy found earlier. The term "Investigative" indicates it's part of the investigation process.

6. Follow-Up Verification Call to Confirm Adjustments (C002 second Call Customer):

   - Context: The second call follows adjustments made (via Adjust Account) and needs to confirm those changes are correct and agreed upon. "Verification Call" highlights the confirmation aspect.

These names should clearly indicate the context in which each activity occurs within the case, making the log's meaning more transparent.

### Justification of Naming Choices:

1. **Initial Document Verification (C001) & Re-Verification Following ID Scan Submission (C001):**  
   - The first name reflects the **initial check** of submitted documents right after the request is made.  
   - The second name clarifies that the re-verification is **triggered by a new ID scan** submitted post-initial request, ensuring all required documents (including the scan) are confirmed.

2. **Physical Document Verification (C003) & Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment (C003):**  
   - The first name specifies a **physical check** (e.g., on-site ID scan in a branch).  
   - The second name indicates the re-verification is **after an account adjustment** caused by missing data, ensuring accuracy post-adjustment.

3. **Outbound Investigative Call (C002) & Follow-Up Verification Call (C002):**  
   - The first name highlights an **investigation step** to resolve discrepancies found earlier.  
   - The second name emphasizes a **confirmation of adjustments** made during the investigation, ensuring stakeholder agreement on changes.

### Key Contextual Clues Used:
- **Agent/Resource Context:** Names now include the role (e.g., *BackOfficeAgent*, *BranchOfficer*) performing the action.  
- **Process Flow Context:** Terms like *Re-Verification Following ID Scan* or *Re-Verification Following Account Adjustment* link activities to prior steps (e.g., ID submission or document adjustments).  
- **Purpose:** Calls like *Outbound Investigative Call* or *Follow-Up Verification Call* explicitly state their role in the workflow (investigation vs. confirmation).  

These changes ensure the log’s events are unambiguous, reflecting how activities evolve based on context within each case.
