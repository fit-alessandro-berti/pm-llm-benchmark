# Comprehensive Event Log for Process Mining

I've integrated the data from the provided ERP tables to create a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining. Each row represents a single event in the order-to-payment process.

## Notes and Assumptions:

1. **Case Identification**: I used `order_id` as the case identifier as specified.

2. **Activity Names**: I derived activity names from the key steps in the order lifecycle:
   - "Order Created" from the Orders table
   - "Item Picked" from the Order Lines table (one event per item)
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" from the Delivery table
   - "Invoice Issued" from the Invoice table
   - "Payment Received" from the Payments table

3. **Timestamps**: Each event has a timestamp from the corresponding table. For example:
   - Order Created uses `order_date`
   - Item Picked uses `item_picking_date`
   - Order Dispatched uses `delivery_dispatch_date`
   - Order Arrived uses `delivery_arrival_date`
   - Invoice Issued uses `invoice_issue_date`
   - Payment Received uses `payment_date`

4. **Resources**: I included the actual resource names (not just IDs) from the Resources table to make the log more readable.
   - For payments, I used "System" as the resource since no specific person was associated with payment processing.

5. **Additional Attributes**: I included relevant attributes for each event to provide context.

6. **Chronological Order**: All events are listed in chronological order based on their timestamps.

7. **Missing Data**: Order 1004 appears to be incomplete in the provided data (no delivery, invoice, or payment records). I included the available events for this order.

This event log captures the complete order-to-payment process for each case, allowing for process mining analysis to identify patterns, bottlenecks, and variations in the process flow.
