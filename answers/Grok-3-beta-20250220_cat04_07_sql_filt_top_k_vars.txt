Let’s construct a DuckDB SQL query to solve this problem step by step. The goal is to identify the top K process variants by frequency and return all events from the `event_log` table that belong to cases matching those top K variants. Here’s the solution with explanations:

### SQL Query
```sql
WITH OrderedEvents AS (
    -- Step 1: Order events within each case by timestamp and assign a row number
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS event_order
    FROM event_log
),
VariantSequences AS (
    -- Step 2: Concatenate activities into a sequence per case
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ') OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_order) AS variant_sequence
    FROM OrderedEvents
    QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) = 1  -- Keep only one row per case
),
VariantCounts AS (
    -- Step 3: Group by variant sequence and count cases per variant
    SELECT 
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) AS case_count
    FROM VariantSequences
    GROUP BY variant_sequence
),
TopKVariants AS (
    -- Step 4: Select top K variants by frequency
    SELECT 
        variant_sequence,
        case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS variant_rank
    FROM VariantCounts
    WHERE variant_rank <= K  -- Replace K with desired number (e.g., 5)
),
TopKCases AS (
    -- Step 5: Get case_ids that belong to top K variants
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        vs.case_id
    FROM VariantSequences vs
    INNER JOIN TopKVariants tkv
        ON vs.variant_sequence = tkv.variant_sequence
)
-- Step 6: Return all events from event_log for cases in top K variants
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN TopKCases tkc
    ON el.case_id = tkc.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

### Explanation of Each Step

1. **OrderedEvents (Step 1):**  
   - For each `case_id`, we assign an `event_order` using `ROW_NUMBER()` based on the `timestamp`. This ensures activities are sequenced correctly within each case.
   - Columns: `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, `event_order`.

2. **VariantSequences (Step 2):**  
   - We use `STRING_AGG` to concatenate the `activity` names into a single string (e.g., "A -> B -> C") for each `case_id`, ordered by `event_order`.
   - The `QUALIFY` clause ensures we only keep one row per `case_id` (since `STRING_AGG` over the full partition gives the complete sequence).
   - Columns: `case_id`, `variant_sequence`.

3. **VariantCounts (Step 3):**  
   - Group by `variant_sequence` and count the distinct `case_id`s to determine how many cases follow each unique process variant.
   - Columns: `variant_sequence`, `case_count`.

4. **TopKVariants (Step 4):**  
   - Use `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank variants by `case_count` in descending order (most frequent first).
   - Filter to keep only the top K variants by checking `variant_rank <= K`. (Note: Replace `K` with an integer, e.g., 5, in practice.)
   - Columns: `variant_sequence`, `case_count`, `variant_rank`.

5. **TopKCases (Step 5):**  
   - Join `VariantSequences` with `TopKVariants` to identify all `case_id`s that belong to the top K variants.
   - Use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicates.
   - Columns: `case_id`.

6. **Final Result (Step 6):**  
   - Join the original `event_log` with `TopKCases` to return all events (with columns `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) for cases in the top K variants.
   - Order by `case_id` and `timestamp` for readability.

### Notes
- **K Value:** The query uses `K` as a placeholder. In a real implementation, replace `WHERE variant_rank <= K` with a specific number (e.g., `WHERE variant_rank <= 5` for the top 5 variants).
- **Performance:** DuckDB’s support for window functions (`STRING_AGG`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `QUALIFY`) makes this efficient for moderate-sized event logs. For very large datasets, indexing on `case_id` and `timestamp` could improve performance.
- **Output:** The final result includes all original columns from `event_log` for the filtered cases, preserving the event-level detail as requested.

Would you like me to adjust the query (e.g., specify a concrete K value) or explain any part in more detail?
