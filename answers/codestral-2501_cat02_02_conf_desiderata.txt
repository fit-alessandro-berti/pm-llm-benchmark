### Analysis of the Event Log

#### 1. Normative Violations

**Case ID 2:**
- **Violation:** The Credit Check was performed after the Risk Assessment.
- **Reason:** The normative rule states that the Credit Check must occur before the Risk Assessment.

**Case ID 2 (continued):**
- **Violation:** Finalize Documentation was performed after a rejection.
- **Reason:** The normative rule states that if the loan is rejected, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation.

#### 2. Desiderata Violations

**Case ID 3:**
- **Desideratum Violation:** The Credit Check was completed more than 24 hours after the application was received.
- **Reason:** While not a normative violation, it is recommended that the Credit Check be completed within 24 hours of receiving the application.

**Case ID 3 (continued):**
- **Desideratum Violation:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision.
- **Reason:** While not a normative violation, it is recommended that the applicant be informed within 48 hours of the loan decision.

**Case ID 3 (continued):**
- **Desideratum Violation:** No Follow-up Call was made before closing the case.
- **Reason:** While not a normative violation, it is recommended to perform a Follow-up Call to ensure all parties are aligned before closing the case.

### Interpretations and Justifications

#### Case ID 2:
- **Interpretation:** The process for Case ID 2 appears to have been disrupted. The Credit Check was performed after the Risk Assessment, which violates the normative sequence. This could be due to an error in the process management or a delay in the Credit Check process.
- **Justification:** To correct this, the process should be restarted from the point where the Credit Check was supposed to occur. The Risk Assessment should be redone after the Credit Check is completed. Additionally, since the loan was rejected, the Finalize Documentation step should be skipped, and the case should be closed immediately after the rejection decision.

#### Case ID 3:
- **Interpretation:** The delays in Case ID 3 are not severe normative violations but represent suboptimal behavior.
- **Justification:** The delays in the Credit Check and Inform Applicant steps can be addressed by expediting these activities. For example, the Credit Check could be expedited by prioritizing the task or by reassigning resources. Similarly, the Inform Applicant step could be expedited by ensuring timely communication channels. The absence of a Follow-up Call can be addressed by scheduling a call before closing the case to ensure all parties are aligned.

### Summary

- **Normative Violations:**
  - **Case ID 2:** Credit Check after Risk Assessment and Finalize Documentation after rejection.

- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - **Case ID 3:** Delayed Credit Check, delayed Inform Applicant, and no Follow-up Call.

By addressing these violations and suboptimal behaviors, the process can be made more efficient and compliant with both normative rules and recommended best practices.
