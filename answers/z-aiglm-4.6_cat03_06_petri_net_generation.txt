<think>
We need to produce Python code that constructs the accepting Petri net for the scenario. The prompt includes a description of a complex insurance claim management process, with activities (C, CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL). The process begins with a start place (perhaps "start" or "claim_arrived") and ends with a final place (closed claim). The initial marking should have a token in the start place. The final marking should have a token in the final place.

We need to include loops: Document Verification (DV) may go to Re-Document Submission (RDS) and back to DV (perhaps multiple times). Similarly, Fraud Check (FC) may go to In-depth Investigation (II) and back to FC multiple times.

Also, there may be a decision after Claim Assessment (CA) that if the amount surpasses a threshold, we require Approval (AP). Otherwise, maybe skip approval and go directly to Payment (P). But the description says "Approval (AP): The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So we could model that as a transition for Approval that is optional (maybe a separate place after CA that leads either to AP or directly to P). However, to keep things simple, we could include a transition AP after CA, but include a place that can be bypassed? Or we could incorporate a decision place after CA that splits into two arcs: one to AP, one to P. Since the scenario doesn't explicitly mention a branch, we can model AP as a transition that always occurs, but it's optional in real process. However, we can incorporate a branching: after CA, we have a place "CA_done". From there, an arc to transition "Approval" (AP) and also an arc to transition "Payment". But we need to ensure that only one of them can fire. In Petri nets, we could use a place that contains a token that can be consumed by either transition, but they both fire to produce a token in the next place. However, if both transitions are enabled, they both could fire (non-deterministic). That's okay. Or we could model a separate "Approval needed" place that is only reached if the condition holds, but that would require additional logic. For simplicity, we can just have AP as a transition after CA and then go to Payment. Or we can have a direct path from CA to Payment and a separate path via AP, both converge into the same place "Payment_start". That would allow optional approval.

Alternatively, we can model a "Decision" transition after CA that splits to AP or P, but we need to model decision as a transition with no label (maybe a silent transition). But the prompt says transitions labeled with activity names. So we could have a transition "Check Amount" that leads to either AP or P. But that would be an extra activity not listed. So maybe we just include AP as always required. In the scenario, they mention "if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So we could include a condition that if threshold not surpassed, skip AP. We could model a silent transition that bypasses AP. However, the prompt doesn't say we cannot use silent transitions. But they ask to label transitions with activity names. But we could have a silent transition labeled with None or no label. However, they might want only the listed activities. The simplest is to always include AP, but we could comment that optional.

But the prompt also includes "Insurance Claim (C)". That's the initial step? Actually the process starts with "Insurance Claim (C)" which is the filing. Then "Claim Registration (CR)" is the first activity after claim filing. So we could have a start place that leads to transition "C" (maybe representing the claim filing). Then after "C", we have a place that leads to "CR". Or we could treat "C" as a transition that is triggered by the claim filing. Or we could treat "C" as a place? The description says "A customer files an Insurance Claim (C), after which the following steps take place". So "C" could be a transition representing the filing. Or we could incorporate the filing as part of the initial marking: the token in the start place indicates that a claim has been filed. Then the first transition is CR. But they list "Insurance Claim (C)" as an activity. So we could include a transition "C" that goes from start to a place after filing. Then CR can follow.

Thus the sequence could be:

- start place (p_start) -> transition "C" -> place p_C_done
- p_C_done -> transition "CR" -> place p_CR_done
- p_CR_done -> transition "DV" -> place p_DV_done
- p_DV_done -> transition "RDS" (if needed) -> back to p_CR_done? Actually RDS should happen after DV if docs incomplete, then go back to DV. So we need a loop: after DV, we have a place p_DV_done that can go to transition "FC" or to "RDS". After RDS, we go back to p_DV_done (or back to DV?). Actually after re-document submission, you need to do DV again. So we could have RDS transition from p_DV_done to a place p_RDS_done, then from p_RDS_done to transition "DV". But that would cause a loop where DV consumes a token from p_RDS_done and goes to p_DV_done again. However, we need to ensure that RDS only occurs when needed. So we could have a place p_DV_done that has a token after DV. Then from p_DV_done, there are two outgoing arcs: one to transition "FC" (continue) and one to transition "RDS". The transition "RDS" leads to a place p_RDS_done, which then leads to transition "DV" again. But we need to ensure that after DV, we go back to p_DV_done again. So the loop would be: p_DV_done -> RDS -> p_RDS_done -> DV -> p_DV_done. However, we need to ensure that DV is only enabled after either initial CR or after RDS. So we need a place before DV that gets token from CR and from RDS. Let's define p_before_DV (or p_DV_ready). After CR, we go to p_DV_ready. DV transition consumes token from p_DV_ready and produces token in p_DV_done. Then p_DV_done leads to either FC or RDS. RDS transition consumes token from p_DV_done and produces token in p_RDS_done. Then from p_RDS_done, we go back to p_DV_ready (maybe via a silent transition or directly to DV). Actually we need to go back to DV, but DV already consumes token from p_DV_ready, not from p_RDS_done. So we need to add a token to p_DV_ready after RDS. So we could have a place p_RDS_done that after RDS, we add a token to p_DV_ready. But we need an arc from RDS to p_DV_ready directly. That would be simpler: after DV, we have p_DV_done. From p_DV_done, we have arc to FC and arc to RDS. RDS goes to p_DV_ready (i.e., back to the start of DV). That would produce a token that can be consumed by DV again. That's okay: RDS transition produces token in p_DV_ready, which is the same place that DV consumes. So we have a loop.

Thus the loop: p_DV_ready -> DV -> p_DV_done -> RDS -> p_DV_ready.

Now for the FC loop: after DV, we go to FC (if no RDS). FC transition consumes token from p_DV_done and produces token in p_FC_done. Then from p_FC_done, we can go to CA, or to II (In-depth Investigation) which loops back to FC. So we need similar structure: p_FC_done is after FC. From p_FC_done, arcs to CA and to II. II transition consumes token from p_FC_done and produces token back in p_FC_done (or maybe produce token in p_FC_ready). But we need to ensure that after II, we go back to FC. So we can have a transition "II" that goes from p_FC_done back to p_FC_ready (or directly to FC). Actually we need a place before FC that is p_FC_ready. The token after DV goes to p_FC_ready, then FC consumes token from p_FC_ready and produces token in p_FC_done. Then from p_FC_done, we can go to CA or II. II transition consumes token from p_FC_done and produces token back to p_FC_ready. That's a loop.

Thus we need p_FC_ready after DV. So we need to adjust: after DV, we go to p_FC_ready (instead of directly to FC). Then FC transition consumes token from p_FC_ready and produces token in p_FC_done. Then p_FC_done leads to CA or II. II leads back to p_FC_ready.

Now after FC (or after CA?), we go to Claim Assessment (CA). So from p_FC_done, we have arc to CA transition. CA consumes token from p_FC_done and produces token in p_CA_done. Then from p_CA_done, we go to Approval (AP) or directly to Payment (P). Let's model optional approval: we can have a place p_CA_done that leads to AP transition and also to P transition. But we need to ensure that only one of them occurs. In Petri net, if both transitions are enabled, both could fire nondeterministically. That's acceptable for modeling. Or we can have a silent transition that chooses one path. But for simplicity, we can have both arcs. The AP transition consumes token from p_CA_done and produces token in p_AP_done. The P transition consumes token from p_CA_done and produces token in p_P_done. Then after AP, we need to go to Payment as well. So we can have p_AP_done leads to P transition (makes sense: after approval, payment). So we need to connect p_AP_done to P transition as well. But P transition can be enabled from either p_CA_done (skip approval) or p_AP_done (after approval). So we need arcs from p_CA_done and p_AP_done to P transition. However, P transition can only consume one token at a time, so we need to ensure that the token is in either place, not both. So we can have two separate input arcs to P from p_CA_done and p_AP_done. That's fine: P is enabled when either place has a token.

After P transition, we produce token in p_P_done. Then from p_P_done, we go to Notification (N) transition, then to Closure (CL) transition, then to final place.

Alternatively, we could combine N and CL as separate transitions.

Now the initial marking: token in start place (p_start). The final marking: token in final place (p_end). We need to ensure that the net is sound (no deadlocks etc). But we can just construct.

We need to define places, transitions, arcs.

Now the code: import pm4py objects, create net, create places, transitions, add them to net, arcs using petri_utils.add_arc_from_to. Then define initial marking (im) and final marking (fm). At the end, we can optionally remove final place? Not needed.

The prompt says "Provide the Python code for constructing the Petri net using pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj.PetriNet, pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj.Marking, and pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils.petri_utils, and define both the initial marking (im) and final marking (fm)." So we need to produce code that does that.

We also need to incorporate loops.

We also need to define names for places and transitions.

We need to ensure that each transition has a label equal to the activity name.

Potentially, we also need to add a silent transition for branching? Not required.

Now let's design the net in detail.

### List of activities:

- C: Insurance Claim filing
- CR: Claim Registration
- DV: Document Verification
- RDS: Re-Document Submission
- FC: Fraud Check
- II: In-depth Investigation
- CA: Claim Assessment
- AP: Approval
- P: Payment
- N: Notification
- CL: Closure

We need to create transitions for each.

### Places:

We need places representing states before each activity.

We can have:

- p_start: initial place (token in im)
- p_C_done: after C (Insurance Claim)
- p_CR_done: after CR
- p_DV_ready: before DV (after CR or after RDS)
- p_DV_done: after DV
- p_FC_ready: before FC (after DV)
- p_FC_done: after FC
- p_CA_done: after CA
- p_AP_done: after AP
- p_P_done: after P
- p_N_done: after N
- p_end: final place (token in fm)

We also need a place for RDS loop: maybe we can reuse p_DV_ready as target of RDS.

Similarly for II loop: p_FC_ready as target of II.

Now arcs:

- p_start -> C -> p_C_done
- p_C_done -> CR -> p_CR_done
- p_CR_done -> p_DV_ready (maybe we need a transition? Actually we can directly go from CR to DV. But we need a place before DV. So we can have CR transition produce token in p_DV_ready. So CR: input from p_C_done, output to p_DV_ready.
- DV: input from p_DV_ready, output to p_DV_done.
- RDS: input from p_DV_done, output to p_DV_ready (loop).
- FC: input from p_FC_ready, output to p_FC_done.
- But we need to get from p_DV_done to p_FC_ready. So we need an arc from p_DV_done to p_FC_ready? Actually we need a transition that moves token from p_DV_done to p_FC_ready. That could be a silent transition (no label) or we could treat the transition "FC" as consuming from p_DV_done directly. But we want to separate the loop for II. So we can have a place p_FC_ready after DV. So we need to have a transition (maybe a silent transition) that moves token from p_DV_done to p_FC_ready. However, we can also have FC transition consume directly from p_DV_done and produce token in p_FC_done, but then we can't loop II back to FC because the token would be consumed. However, we can have II transition produce token back to p_DV_done? That would cause a loop but not exactly what we want. Let's think.

Better design: after DV, we have a place p_DV_done. From p_DV_done, we have two outgoing arcs: one to FC transition (continue) and one to RDS transition (loop). So FC transition consumes token from p_DV_done and produces token in p_FC_done. Then from p_FC_done, arcs to CA transition and to II transition. II transition consumes token from p_FC_done and produces token back to p_DV_done? Or to p_FC_ready? Actually we need to go back to FC. So we could have II transition produce token back to p_DV_done, which would be before FC again. But that would also allow RDS loop again? Actually after II, we want to go back to FC (i.e., after DV). So if we produce token back to p_DV_done, then FC can fire again. That's okay. So we can have II transition produce token back to p_DV_done. However, we also need a place for FC ready? Not needed if we use p_DV_done as the input for FC. But then we need to ensure that after II, the token is in the same place as before FC. That's okay.

Thus we can simplify: Use p_DV_done as place after DV. FC consumes token from p_DV_done and produces token in p_FC_done. Then from p_FC_done, we have arcs to CA and II. II consumes token from p_FC_done and produces token back to p_DV_done. This forms a loop: after FC, you can go to CA, or if needed, go to II and then back to FC (via p_DV_done). That's fine.

Now after CA, we need optional approval. So CA transition consumes token from p_FC_done and produces token in p_CA_done. Then from p_CA_done, we have arcs to AP transition and to P transition. AP consumes token from p_CA_done and produces token in p_AP_done. Then from p_AP_done, we have arc to P transition (so P can be enabled from p_AP_done). Meanwhile, P transition also has input from p_CA_done (direct). So we need to add arcs from p_CA_done and p_AP_done to P. However, we need to ensure that P consumes token from either place. But we cannot have two separate input arcs to the same transition from different places? Yes, we can. The transition P will be enabled if any of its input places has a token. Actually in standard Petri nets, a transition is enabled if each input place has at least as many tokens as the multiplicity of the arc. If there are multiple input arcs from different places, all input places must have tokens. So if we have arcs from p_CA_done and p_AP_done to P, then P would require both tokens to fire, which is not what we want. So we cannot have both arcs. Instead, we need to have two separate transitions: one for Payment after Approval (maybe the same P but with different input places). But we cannot have the same transition with multiple input places unless we want both tokens. So we need to model optional approval differently: maybe we have a silent transition that merges the two flows into a single place before Payment. For example, after CA, we have a place p_CA_done. From p_CA_done, we have a silent transition (tau) that goes to a place p_before_P. Also AP transition goes to p_before_P. Then P transition consumes token from p_before_P. That way, either path leads to the same place. However, the silent transition is not labeled with an activity name. That's okay; we can have a transition without a label. Or we can label it "skip_approval" or something. But the prompt says transitions labeled with activity names. It doesn't forbid unlabeled transitions. But we can also label it "Skip Approval" (SA) or something. But not required.

Alternatively, we could model the approval as part of the same transition P: i.e., the P transition includes approval if needed. But that would not be accurate.

Another approach: we could have a separate transition "P" that is always after CA, but we can model the approval as an activity that may or may not be executed. But we want to capture the optional nature. So we need a branching.

Simplify: we can have a place p_CA_done. Then we have a transition "AP" that consumes token from p_CA_done and produces token in p_AP_done. Then we have a transition "P" that consumes token from p_AP_done and produces token in p_P_done. Additionally, we have a transition "P_direct" (maybe labeled "Payment (No Approval)") that consumes token from p_CA_done and produces token in p_P_done. But that would be a separate transition with a different label, not in the list. But we could label it "Payment" as well, but then we have two transitions with same label, which is okay but might be confusing.

Better to use a silent transition to combine flows.

Thus we can have:

- p_CA_done -> transition "AP" -> p_AP_done
- p_CA_done -> silent transition "tau_skip" -> p_before_P
- p_AP_done -> transition "P" -> p_P_done
- p_before_P -> transition "P" -> p_P_done

But we need to ensure that P transition has only one input place (p_before_P). So we need to have both flows converge to p_before_P. So after AP, we need a silent transition that moves token from p_AP_done to p_before_P. Or we can have AP produce token directly in p_before_P. That would combine flows. So we could have AP transition produce token in p_before_P. Then we also have a silent transition from p_CA_done to p_before_P to skip approval. Then we have P transition consume token from p_before_P.

Thus:

- p_CA_done -> AP -> p_before_P
- p_CA_done -> tau_skip -> p_before_P

But we need to ensure that only one of these can fire. If both are enabled, both could fire, producing two tokens in p_before_P, then P would fire twice. That's not desirable. However, we can use a conflict: both transitions share the same input place p_CA_done, so only one can consume the token. That's fine: after CA, the token is in p_CA_done. Then either AP or tau_skip can fire, consuming the token. So that's okay.

Thus after AP or tau_skip, token is placed in p_before_P. Then P transition consumes token from p_before_P and produces token in p_P_done.

Now after P, we have N and CL.

Thus:

- p_before_P -> P -> p_P_done
- p_P_done -> N -> p_N_done
- p_N_done -> CL -> p_end

Now we need to define the arcs accordingly.

Now the initial marking: token in p_start.

The final marking: token in p_end.

Now we need to ensure that all transitions are added to net, all places added, arcs added.

Now we need to write the code.

We need to import:

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils
```

Now create net:

```python
net = PetriNet(name="insurance_claim_process")
```

Now create places:

```python
# Places
p_start = PetriNet.Place(name="start")
p_C_done = PetriNet.Place(name="C_done")
p_CR_done = PetriNet.Place(name="CR_done")
p_DV_done = PetriNet.Place(name="DV_done")
p_FC_done = PetriNet.Place(name="FC_done")
p_CA_done = PetriNet.Place(name="CA_done")
p_before_P = PetriNet.Place(name="before_P")
p_P_done = PetriNet.Place(name="P_done")
p_N_done = PetriNet.Place(name="N_done")
p_end = PetriNet.Place(name="end")
```

We also may need a place for RDS loop? Actually RDS loop uses p_DV_done as input and output to p_DV_ready? Wait we changed design: after DV, we have p_DV_done. Then RDS transition consumes token from p_DV_done and produces token back to p_DV_ready? But we don't have p_DV_ready now. Actually we have p_DV_done as place after DV. The DV transition consumes token from p_CR_done and produces token in p_DV_done. Then RDS transition consumes token from p_DV_done and produces token back to p_CR_done? Or to p_DV_ready? Let's reconsider.

We need to model DV loop: after DV, either go to FC or go to RDS. After RDS, we need to go back to DV. So we need a place before DV that is the input for DV. Currently we have DV transition input from p_CR_done. That is okay for the first DV. But after RDS, we need to go back to DV again, so we need a token in p_CR_done? Actually after RDS, we need to go back to DV, not to CR. So we need a separate place for DV ready. Let's introduce p_DV_ready.

Thus we need a place p_DV_ready before DV. After CR, we go to p_DV_ready. DV consumes token from p_DV_ready and produces token in p_DV_done. Then RDS consumes token from p_DV_done and produces token back to p_DV_ready. Also FC consumes token from p_DV_done and produces token in p_FC_done.

Thus we need p_DV_ready.

Thus places:

- p_start
- p_C_done
- p_CR_done
- p_DV_ready
- p_DV_done
- p_FC_done
- p_CA_done
- p_before_P
- p_P_done
- p_N_done
- p_end

Now arcs:

- p_start -> C -> p_C_done
- p_C_done -> CR -> p_CR_done
- p_CR_done -> p_DV_ready (maybe we need a transition? Actually CR transition can produce token in p_DV_ready directly. So we set CR's output to p_DV_ready.
- DV: input from p_DV_ready, output to p_DV_done.
- RDS: input from p_DV_done, output to p_DV_ready.
- FC: input from p_DV_done, output to p_FC_done.
- II: input from p_FC_done, output to p_DV_done (loop back to FC). Actually we want II to go back to FC, i.e., after II, we need to go to FC again. So we need to produce token in p_DV_done? Wait FC consumes from p_DV_done, not from p_FC_done. Actually after DV, we have p_DV_done. FC consumes token from p_DV_done and produces token in p_FC_done. So after II, we need to go back to DV? Or to FC? The description: "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)." So after FC, if doubts, we do II, then go back to FC again (i.e., after II, you do FC again). So the loop should be: p_FC_done -> II -> p_DV_done? Wait FC consumes token from p_DV_done. After FC, token is in p_FC_done. Then II consumes token from p_FC_done and produces token back to p_DV_done, so that FC can fire again. That works: after II, token is back in p_DV_done, which is the input for FC. So we need II transition input from p_FC_done, output to p_DV_done.

Thus arcs:

- II: input p_FC_done, output p_DV_done.

Now after FC (when no II needed), we go to CA. So CA transition input from p_FC_done, output to p_CA_done.

Thus arcs:

- CA: input p_FC_done, output p_CA_done.

Now after CA,
</think>
