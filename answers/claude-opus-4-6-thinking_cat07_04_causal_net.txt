# Description of the Visualization

## Overview
This is a **workflow net (Petri net)** diagram representing a business process for handling requests, likely an insurance claim or compensation process. It includes both the main process model and a **legend** explaining the routing constructs.

## Process Flow

### Activities (Tasks)
The process contains the following labeled activities (shown as rounded squares):

| Node | Activity |
|------|----------|
| **a** | Register request |
| **b** | Examine thoroughly |
| **c** | Examine casually |
| **d** | Check ticket |
| **e** | Decide |
| **f** | Reinitiate request |
| **g** | Pay compensation |
| **h** | Reject request |
| **z** | End |

### Flow Logic
1. **Start**: Activity **a** (register request) initiates the process.
2. **AND-split**: After registration, three parallel activities are triggered — **b** (examine thoroughly), **c** (examine casually), and **d** (check ticket).
3. **AND-join**: All parallel branches synchronize before activity **e** (decide).
4. **XOR-split**: After deciding, the process either:
   - **g** — Pay compensation  **z** (end), or
   - **h** — Reject request  **z** (end), or
   - Loops back to **f** (reinitiate request), which feeds back to re-execute the examination activities.

## Legend (Bottom-Right)
The legend explains six **routing constructs** used in workflow nets:

- **XOR-split / XOR-join** — Exclusive choice / merge (one path selected)
- **AND-split / AND-join** — Parallel fork / synchronization (all paths taken)
- **OR-split / OR-join** — Inclusive choice / merge (one or more paths)

These are depicted using places (circles/dots) and transitions (squares) with varying connection patterns.

## Key Characteristics
- **Black dots** represent tokens/places (control flow markers in Petri nets)
- The model includes a **loop** (reinitiate request), allowing iterative processing
- It demonstrates both **parallelism** (AND-split after "a") and **choice** (XOR-split after "e")
