After analyzing the patient data, here are some key differences:

1. **Clinical Context**: The most significant difference is that patients with no complications (discovery) have more successful treatment plans than those who experience issues during a diagnosis or before treatment begins (before diagnosis).
2. **Prioritization of Treatments**: Patients who receive treatments while awaiting outcomes (discharge candidates) are prioritized over those who require immediate medical attention without preceding diagnosis (candidates for diagnosis). This suggests that the system emphasizes prompt intervention to reduce unnecessary delay.
3. **Variation in Treatment Schedules**:
	* Thorough Examination and Diagnosis -> Discharge: 2 patients out of 9
	* Expert Examination and Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment successful, but prior diagnosis is necessary: 5 patients
	* Specialist Review (ER) : Only 1 patient who received an initial "before-dialysis" treatment was deemed successful in the first phase. Although they were diagnosed later, as part of their pre-diagnosis management plan, and also had all other specified complications addressed before undergoing dialysis, only this very instance met two criteria for discharge.

These differences illustrate the trade-offs made by the system:

* Quick treatments are prioritized over delayed or complex care plans.
* Patients who receive diagnoses without preceding treatment may continue with successful outcomes despite the initial lack of diagnosis guidance.
* The use of specialists and early intervention might be justified under specific circumstances (e.g., patient progression management), suggesting that these elements could further enhance treatment outcome prediction.

It is essential to note that such a system would require careful evaluation regarding bias towards prompt treatment, the effectiveness of pre-diagnosis evaluation criteria for prioritizing initial approaches or even potential misdirection by prioritization bias itself.
