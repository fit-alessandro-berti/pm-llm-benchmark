```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Subquery:**
   -  `SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`
     - This subquery groups events by `case_id` and counts the number of events in each group (`COUNT(*)`).
     - The `HAVING` clause filters out groups (i.e., cases) where the event count is greater than 6.

2. **Outer Query:**
   - `SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (...)`
     - This outer query selects all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` table.
     - It filters the results using the `IN` clause, keeping only events that belong to `case_id` values included in the subquery's result set. Essentially, this ensures that only events from cases with 6 or fewer events are returned.
