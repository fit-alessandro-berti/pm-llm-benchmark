To model the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions using POWL models, we need to create two versions: one with potential unfairness and another without it. Letâ€™s define these models in Python using the provided `pm4py` framework.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this version of the model, applicants who indicate membership in a specific community or are local residents receive an advantage during the cultural fit evaluation phase. This introduces potential unfairness into the hiring process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions for each activity in the workflow.
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for data completeness check
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define XOR choice between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck
choice_cultural_fit_or_community_affil = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, 
                                                      children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the order of activities in a partial order.
root_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_data_completeness,
    SkillAssessment,
    choice_cultural_fit_or_community_affil,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])
root_unfairness.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_completeness)
root_unfairness.order.add_edge(loop_data_completeness, SkillAssessment)
root_unfairness.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, choice_cultural_fit_or_community_affil)
root_unfairness.order.add_edge(choice_cultural_fit_or_community_affil, ManagerialReview)
root_unfairness.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Display the POWL model
pm4py.view_powl(root_unfairness)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

In this version of the model, all applicants undergo a standard cultural fit evaluation without any special considerations for community affiliations or local residency.

```python
# Define individual transitions for each activity in the workflow.
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for data completeness check
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the order of activities in a partial order.
root_no_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_data_completeness,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])
root_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_completeness)
root_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(loop_data_completeness, SkillAssessment)
root_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Display the POWL model
pm4py.view_powl(root_no_unfairness)
```

### Explanation

- **Unfair Model**:
  - After skill assessment, applicants are either evaluated for standard cultural fit or have their community affiliations considered.
  - This branch introduces potential unfair bias towards certain candidates.

- **Fair Model**:
  - All applicants go through the same process of skill assessment followed by a uniform cultural fit evaluation.
  - No special branches exist to provide preferential treatment based on community affiliations or local residency.

These models demonstrate how the hiring workflow can be structured to either introduce potential biases or ensure a fair and transparent process.
