The visualization is a Sankey-like flow diagram that shows transitions between three states: "Send Fine," "Insert Fine Notification," and "Send for Credit Collection." These states are arranged vertically on the right side of the diagram, with:

- "Send Fine" at the top
- "Insert Fine Notification" in the middle
- "Send for Credit Collection" at the bottom

The x-axis represents time, ranging from January 25, 2000, through September 9, 2006, to April 24, 2013.

The connections between the states represent flow or transitions over time. Most flows originate at the "Send Fine" state at the top and move downward:

- Many flows directly transition from "Send Fine" to "Insert Fine Notification."
- Some flows continue further down to "Send for Credit Collection," with these flows highlighted in red, indicating significance or a different category.
- The thickness of the flows varies, which likely illustrates the volume or frequency of transitions.

Overall, the diagram visually represents the timeline and frequency of transitions between these three procedural steps involving fines and credit collections over a span of more than a decade. The red lines particularly highlight the transition leading to credit collection events.
