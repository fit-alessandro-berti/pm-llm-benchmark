### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

#### 1.1 Data Preprocessing and Integration

**Challenges:**  
- **Data heterogeneity:** Events come from multiple sources (GPS, handheld scanners, dispatch, maintenance) with varying schemas, timestamps (timezones, precision), and completeness.  
- **Missing or inconsistent identifiers:** Case ID (vehicle-day) and Package ID may be inconsistent or missing in some logs, complicating entity resolution.  
- **Event time alignment:** Dispatch plans are static; actual events include unscheduled delays, stops, and deviations — requiring temporal normalization.  
- **Noise and redundancy:** Repeated or erroneous scanner entries (e.g., duplicate records, off-hours logs) must be filtered.

**Preprocessing Steps:**  
- Normalize timestamps to UTC and align to consistent intervals (e.g., 30-second granularity).  
- Enrich data with entity resolution: map Case ID  Vehicle-Day  Vehicle-Package links using Patterns or timestamps and sequence logic.  
- Clean and deduplicate events: remove duplicates, filter outliers (e.g., impossible speeds), validate location plausibility.  
- Enrich with metadata: assign vehicle type, driver ID, route phase (e.g., departure, delivery, idle), and contextual tags (e.g., “failed delivery” from scanner notes).  
- Structure behavior as a directed graph with entities (Vehicle, Package), events (Arrive, Deliver, Stop, Depart, Failure) and state transitions.

#### 1.2 Process Discovery and Visualization of Actual Process

**Method:**  
Use **algorithmic process discovery** (e.g., Petri nets, reverse-engineered BPMN models) with tools like ProM or Celonis to derive a *discovered* process model from the event log. Since activity data and sequence events are abundant, **frequent patterns mining** and **discrepancy profiling** are essential.

**Expected Actual Process View:**  
- The end-to-end process shows a typical cycle: Depart Depot  Arrive at Location  Customer Interaction (dwell/time)  Deliver/Attempt  Failure or Success  Depart Customer.  
- Actual paths reveal process *variants*—e.g., standard route  detour due to traffic  engine alert  unscheduled stop  early return (if delivery failed).  
- Missing handoffs and unplanned stops (e.g., traffic jams, vehicle warnings) will appear as divergence from planned linear flows.  
- Engage drivers’ verifiable routes (depot  stops) and package assignments to ground the model realistically.

#### 1.3 Conformance Checking Against Dispatched Plans

**Process Model Comparison:**  
- Compare the discovered process against *dispatched* (planned) process models using conformance metrics:  
  - **Structural conformance:** Structural alignment percentage (shared activities/sequence).  
  - **Instance conformance:** Proportion of actual events matching planned activities (e.g., on-time route start vs. scheduled start).  
  - **Timing conformance:** Deviation in sequence durations (e.g., excessive delays at Device B).  
- Identify key deviations:  
  - Unplanned stops (no scheduled hover/charging periods).  
  - Schedule races or idle times not planned.  
  - Avoided or reverse waypoints (indicative of traffic navigation errors).  
  - Failure/retry loops causing timeline drift.

**Insights:**  
Deviation analysis reveals systemic inefficiencies—e.g., chronic traffic bottlenecks or repeated failed deliveries due to poor time slot handling—unseen in static plans.

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

#### 2.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI                               | Calculation Basis from Event Log                                      | Strategic Importance                                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate (%)**      | (Deliveries completed by scheduled ETA) / (Total deliveries) × 100 | Direct measure of punctuality and customer satisfaction  |
| **Average Time per Delivery Stop** | (Total time between Scanner ‘Arrive’ and ‘Depart’ at Customer) / # stops | Reveals efficiency at customer point of interaction  |
| **Travel Time / Service Time Ratio** | Total travel time / (travel time + dwell time at customer)            | Shows balance; >1 indicates excessive solo driving     |
| **Fuel Efficiency (km/L or L/100km)** | Total distance driven / Total fuel consumed by vehicle              | Direct cost driver; guides routing and vehicle choice |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate (%)**  | (Time spent delivering / Total shift time) × 100                    | Indicates idle vs. active time; identifies underused assets |
| **Fail Rate per Package**          | Number of failed deliveries / Total deliveries × 100                 | Highlights issues in delivery execution (e.g., access, timing) |
| **Traffic Delay Time**             | Time differences between actual travel duration and scheduled time due to traffic recorded in GPS log | Links operational delays to environmental factors       |
| **Engine Warning Stops**           | Duration totaling when vehicle speed near stall or error logs activated | Signals maintenance risk and impact on fuel/time loss  |

#### 2.2 Bottleneck Identification Techniques

- **Variant Analysis:** Cluster deliveries by route segment, driver, time-of-day, and compare timings and delays against planned benchmarks. For example:
  - Route A shows 40% longer travel time during peak hours due to congestion vs. Route B.  
  - Higher failed deliveries cluster around specific neighborhoods with frequent traffic jams or poor parking access.  
- **Time-Based Drilldown:** Examine delays at fixed phases—e.g., arrival time at depot (Idle) vs. arrival (Start Drive) to detect systemic idle inefficiencies.  
- **Spatial Heatmaps (via location data):** Identify high-delay zones mapped on GPS coordinates; correlate with traffic incident reports or gridlock data.  
- **Correlation with External Data:** Overlay maintenance logs to detect shutdown-related bottlenecks; correlate traffic delays with real-time feeds.  
- **Driver and Vehicle Performance Profiling:** Compare KPIs across drivers—identify outliers, e.g., drivers with many traffic stalls or repeated time window violations.

**Expected Bottlenecks:**  
- Unplanned traffic delays disrupting schedules.  
- Oversized dwell times due to inefficient staging or customer access issues.  
- Repair downtime during peak shifts causing ripple delays.  
- High-volume neighborhoods overwhelming delivery capacity, increasing skip failures.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

Process mining disentangles *where* and *why* delays occur beyond surface observations by enabling fine-grained variant and activity analysis.

- **Suboptimal Route Planning:**  
  - Compare sequential activity patterns across routes; discrepancies reveal poorly planned detours, missing skip optimizations, or unrealistic ETA assumptions.  
  - Use **guarded paths analysis** to identify areas where vehicles frequently deviate from planner.

- **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimation:**  
  - Map actual travel durations against planned times per route segment; statistically significant delays suggest poor historical data use or static planning.  
  - Highlight segments with high variance or persistent lateness as indicative of unreliable time estimates.

- **Traffic Congestion Patterns:**  
  - GPS speed and stop logs correlate with traffic incident data; recurring delays at specific times/locations signal chronic congestion hotspots.  
  - Traffic-related delays often cluster during peak hours, confirming timing misalignment in routing.

- **Service Time Variability:**  
  - Dwell time distribution shows large variance; some stops are rushed, others unnecessarily long (e.g., unknown reason).  
  - Deep dive with driver logs or scanning notes identifies inconsistent customer interaction procedures or access bottlenecks.

- **Vehicle Breakdown and Maintenance Needs:**  
  - Unscheduled stops or speed drops preceding failures reveal preventive maintenance gaps.  
  - Frequency and timing of shutdowns correlate with vehicle age, maintenance logs, and operational intensity.

- **Failed Delivery Excesses:**  
  - High fail rates trace to inadequate time windows, customer absence, or access issues in placement.  
  - Analysis links handle points: lack of proper drop-off locations drives retrial efforts.

**Validation via Process Mining:**  
Use **grouping by historical performance** (e.g., compare low vs. high On-Time drivers/stops) to isolate causing variables. Pair mined process variants with failure modes to identify root process stages (e.g., pre-delivery attempted drop-off, late scan data submission).

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments Based on Real-Time Conditions**  
- Targets: Reduce traffic delays, unscheduled stops, and idle times.  
- Root Causes Addressed: Inaccurate SG-related routing, missed congestion signals, reactive driver behavior.  
- Approach:  
  - Integrate live traffic feeds (via API) and IoT alerts (engine warnings) into dispatch system.  
  - Apply process mining-derived “optimal deviation paths” (e.g., early detours, skip drop-offs) as real-time routing suggestions.  
  - Use predictive algorithms forecasting delays per segment to proactively adjust routes mid-day.  
- Process Mining Support:  
  - Mining expected vs. actual arrival times on routes reveals persistent high-risk segments (e.g., downtown, construction zones).  
  - Variant clustering identifies frequent failure points (e.g., time-window violations per driver/vehicle).  
- Expected Impact: Up by 20–30% On-Time Delivery Rate; 15–20% reduction in travel hours; lower fuel consumption from avoiding stop-and-go reroutes.

**Strategy 2: Territory and Route Optimization Using Performance Clustering**  
- Targets: Avoid overloaded or inefficient delivery zones, balance workload.  
- Root Causes Addressed: Geographic imbalance, poor route sequencing, lack of clustering effect.  
- Approach:  
  - Cluster vehicle-day activity data into high/low-performing service clusters using k-means on time efficiency, dwell times, and fuel use.  
  - Assign dedicated micro-territories per vehicle or driver to reduce route switching and improve familiarity.  
  - Redesign “hotspot” zones by rebalancing time windows or introducing staggered deliveries.  
- Process Mining Support:  
  - KPIs like On-Time Rate and Utilization Rate are grouped by geographic clusters and time bands.  
  - Identification of underperforming zones via outlier analysis reveals mismatches between current assignments and operational efficiency.  
- Expected Impact: 10–15% shorter travel times, 5% higher vehicle utilization, lower fail rates in overloaded zones.

**Strategy 3: Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Based on Vehicle Usage Mining**  
- Targets: Minimize unscheduled stops, reduce breakdown-related delays.  
- Root Causes Addressed: Reactive and unplanned maintenance causing downtime during shifts.  
- Approach:  
  - Mine event log sequence patterns for early warning signs (e.g., recurring speed drops before shutdowns, excessive idle during drive segments).  
  - Correlate maintenance logs with vehicle usage intensity (mileage, operational hours, stress indicators from speed/engine error logs).  
  - Develop predictive maintenance triggers: e.g., alerts when engine temperature patterns exceed thresholds (from sustained high-speed driving in traffic).  
- Process Mining Support:  
  - Analyze time-to-failure distributions; use failure rate variance by vehicle cohort.  
  - Map stop durations pre-maintenance failure events to estimate early shutdown patterns.  
- Expected Impact: 30–40% reduction in breakdown-related delays; improved fleet availability; extended vehicle lifespan.

### 5. Operational Constraints and Monitoring Plan

#### Operational Constraints Integration

- **Driver Working Hours:** Embed core shift limits (e.g., 10-hour max) into scheduling algorithms; refer process mining’s stop/sequence data to flag potential overwork or fatigue risks (e.g., continuous 8+ stop sequences without rest).  
- **Vehicle Capacity:** Map package delivery totals per route vs. vehicle capacity; mine route assignment logs to detect overloading or underutilization.  
- **Customer Time Windows:** Cluster deliveries by time window compliance; process mining identifies systemic window violations by driver/zone, enabling targeted adjustments.  

#### Continuous Monitoring with Process Mining Dashboards

- **Core Metrics to Track:**  
  - On-Time Delivery Rate (by day, driver, zone)  
  - Avg. Stop Time & Dwell Time Distribution (by delivery type)  
  - Fuel Efficiency (km/L per shift)  
  - Conflict Rate (unscheduled vs. planned stops)  
  - Engine Warning Duration (per vehicle per shift)  
  - Maintenance Downtime Percent  

- **Process Mining Dashboard Features:**  
  - **Process Flow Snapshots:** Visualized end-to-end delivery workflows, with real-time highlights of deviations and bottlenecks.  
  - **Variant Analyses:** Drill down into process clusters (high/low performers) to isolate root causes dynamically.  
  - **Performance Trends:** Time-series charts tracking KPIs pre- and post-optimization (e.g., before/after dynamic routing rollout).  
  - **Alerts & Drilldowns:** Trigger notifications on anomalies (e.g., sudden spike in failed deliveries) with drilldown paths to root events.  

- **Feedback Loop:**  
  - Monthly process mining reviews compare actual vs. planned, assess impact of implemented strategies, and update models with new data.  
  - Integrate driver feedback and sensor data into a living process model, enabling adaptive learning and long-term optimization.
