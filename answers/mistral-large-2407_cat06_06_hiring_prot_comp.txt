To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to compare the process variants and their execution times (performance) for each group. Here are the main differences observed:

### 1. Frequency and Performance of Common Process Variants

#### Common Process Variants with Significant Frequency Differences:
- **Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Protected Group: frequency = 73, performance = 320022.890
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 1466, performance = 320004.432

- **Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Protected Group: frequency = 78, performance = 320020.038
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 1418, performance = 319999.055

- **Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Protected Group: frequency = 112, performance = 319997.062
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 656, performance = 320002.980

- **Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Protected Group: frequency = 179, performance = 260008.950
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 653, performance = 260001.864

- **Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Protected Group: frequency = 174, performance = 260009.195
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 592, performance = 260005.228

### 2. Performance Differences in Similar Process Variants

#### Similar Process Variants with Performance Differences:
- **Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Protected Group: frequency = 284, performance = 260001.236
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 279, performance = 260005.208

- **Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Protected Group: frequency = 269, performance = 260006.914
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 262, performance = 260006.336

- **Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Protected Group: frequency = 31, performance = 419998.516
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 88, performance = 420006.864

### 3. Unique Process Variants

#### Unique Process Variants in the Unprotected Group:
- **Discharge**
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 505, performance = 0.000

- **Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 192, performance = 220004.479

- **Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 82, performance = 160013.378

### 4. Process Variants with Zero Performance

#### Process Variants with Zero Performance:
- **Register at ER**
  - Protected Group: frequency = 158, performance = 0.000

- **Register at FD**
  - Protected Group: frequency = 156, performance = 0.000

### 5. Complex Process Variants with Multiple Treatment Cycles

#### Complex Process Variants with Multiple Treatment Cycles:
- **Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 40, performance = 639982.275

- **Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge**
  - Unprotected Group: frequency = 35, performance = 639972.457

### Summary of Main Differences:
1. **Frequency Disparity**: The unprotected group has significantly higher frequencies for complex process variants involving thorough examinations and multiple treatment cycles.
2. **Performance Disparity**: While some performance times are similar, there are notable differences in the performance of similar process variants.
3. **Unique Process Variants**: The unprotected group has unique process variants that are not present in the protected group, such as direct discharge and thorough examination without registration.
4. **Zero Performance**: The protected group has process variants with zero performance, which are not present in the unprotected group.
5. **Complex Treatment Cycles**: The unprotected group has more complex treatment cycles with multiple unsuccessful treatments followed by successful treatments.

These differences suggest that the unprotected group may be subject to more thorough and complex treatment processes, potentially leading to longer execution times and more frequent occurrences of certain process variants.
