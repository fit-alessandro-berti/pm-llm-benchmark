The provided visualization is a flowchart that illustrates the interaction between two processes: credit scoring (bank) and scoring service. The chart is divided into two sections, with the top section representing the credit scoring process and the bottom section representing the scoring service.

**Credit Scoring Process**

*   The credit scoring process begins with a request for a credit score, which is received by the bank.
*   The bank then sends a request for a credit score to the scoring service.
*   The scoring service computes the credit score (level 1) and sends it back to the bank.
*   The bank then reports a delay in providing the information, which is received by the scoring service.
*   The scoring service computes the credit score (level 2) and sends it back to the bank.
*   The bank reports a delay in providing the information, which is received by the scoring service.
*   The scoring service sends the credit score to the bank, which is then handed over to the scoring request.

**Scoring Service**

*   The scoring service receives a request for a credit score from the bank.
*   The scoring service computes the credit score (level 1) and sends it back to the bank.
*   The scoring service reports a delay in providing the information, which is received by the bank.
*   The scoring service computes the credit score (level 2) and sends it back to the bank.
*   The scoring service sends the credit score to the bank, which is then handed over to the scoring request.

In summary, the visualization shows the interaction between the credit scoring process and the scoring service, with the credit scoring process sending requests for credit scores to the scoring service and receiving responses, while the scoring service computes credit scores based on the requests received.
