Process enhancement is one of the key applications of process mining, focusing on improving existing business processes based on insights gained from analyzing event data. It involves identifying inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and deviations in current processes and suggesting actionable improvements to enhance performance, reduce costs, increase efficiency, or improve quality. The goal of process enhancement is to optimize processes to align better with the organization's objectives or to adapt to changing business needs.

Process enhancement differs from process discovery and conformance checking in several fundamental ways:

1. **Process Discovery**:
   - **Objective**: The primary goal of process discovery is to create a model of the process as it is actually being executed, based on event logs. It helps organizations uncover the real process workflows, which might differ from documented procedures or assumed models.
   - **Focus**: This phase emphasizes understanding the "as-is" process by extracting and mapping out the workflow from event logs without any prior assumptions.
   - **Outcome**: The outcome is a process model that visualizes how the process operates in real life.

2. **Conformance Checking**:
   - **Objective**: The main aim of conformance checking is to compare the discovered or existing process model against the ideal or intended process model to identify deviations.
   - **Focus**: It seeks to assess the adherence of the event data to the predefined model, identifying where practice deviates from the intended process.
   - **Outcome**: The result is a highlighted set of deviations, discrepancies, or non-conforming behaviors that can be further analyzed.

3. **Process Enhancement**:
   - **Objective**: The objective of process enhancement is to improve and refine processes by leveraging the insights acquired from discovery and conformance checking.
   - **Focus**: This phase emphasizes making data-driven improvements, whether by redesigning part of the process, reallocating resources, or automating certain tasks.
   - **Outcome**: Enhanced processes which perform more effectively and efficiently, often supported by key metrics improvement and alignment with strategic goals.

In summary, while process discovery focuses on understanding what the process is, and conformance checking assesses how well the process meets expectations, process enhancement is concerned with making tangible improvements based on these insights to ensure operational excellence.
