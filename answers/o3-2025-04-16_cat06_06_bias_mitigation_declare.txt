Explanation of the added constraints
1. existence(BiasMitigationCheck) – guarantees every case performs at least one dedicated biasmitigation activity.
2. coexistence(Reject, ManualReview) and coexistence(Approve, ManualReview) – whenever a final decision (either Reject or Approve) is made, a ManualReview by a human expert is also carried out in the same trace, ensuring that automated decisions affecting applicants always receive a human check.
3. response(CheckApplicant*, BiasMitigationCheck) – every time the process inspects a sensitive attribute (age, gender or race), it must subsequently perform a biasmitigation check before finishing the case.
4. precedence(Reject/Approve, BiasMitigationCheck) – a decision cannot be taken unless a biasmitigation check has already occurred, ruling out “lastminute” skips of the fairness control.
5. nonsuccession(CheckApplicant*, Reject/Approve) – prevents an immediate transition from seeing a sensitive attribute to issuing the final decision; at least one other activity (the bias check or something else) has to intervene, reducing the risk of impulsive, discriminatory outcomes.

Together these constraints oblige the process to:
• always run an explicit bias mitigation step,
• couple every sensitive decision with a manual human review,
• forbid “instant” rejections/approvals right after reading sensitive data.

As a result, the execution traces that violate fairness principles are ruled out by construction, effectively reducing the possibility of biased treatment of applicants.
