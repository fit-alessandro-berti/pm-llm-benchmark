Explanation of the added anti-bias constraints
------------------------------------------------
1. existence – BiasMitigationCheck  
   Guarantees that every case contains at least one dedicated activity that explicitly searches for bias before a decision is taken.

2. responded_existence – (CheckApplicant*  BiasMitigationCheck)  
   Enforces that whenever an applicant’s sensitive attribute (age, gender, race) is inspected, a bias-mitigation activity must also appear in the same trace, ensuring that the attribute is not used unchecked.

3. nonsuccession – (CheckApplicant*  Reject/Approve)  
   Prohibits a direct jump from viewing a sensitive attribute to a positive or negative decision, eliminating “knee-jerk” discriminatory outcomes.

4. response & chainprecedence – BiasMitigationCheck  … ManualReview (immediate precedence)  
   • response: a bias check must eventually be followed by a manual (human) review.  
   • chainprecedence: that manual review has to be the *next* activity after the bias check, cementing a structured review pipeline.

5. coexistence – ManualReview  FinalDecision  
   Binds every final decision to the presence of a manual review (and vice-versa), assuring that an additional, human-in-the-loop control always accompanies the automated recommendation.

Together these constraints force any potentially discriminatory information to be passed through a bias-mitigation step and a separate manual review before a final decision is reached, while also preventing decisions that are made immediately after inspecting sensitive attributes. This substantially reduces the likelihood of biased outcomes in the loan-application process.
