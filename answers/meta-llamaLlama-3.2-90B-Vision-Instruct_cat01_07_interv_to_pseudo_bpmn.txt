Based on the provided interview excerpts, I will construct a BPMN-like textual process model for the invoice approval process. Please note that the model aims to consolidate the information from various stakeholders, highlighting the typical sequence of steps, decision points, and roles involved.

		- **Activity 2:** Log PO Number Request in System (Mary)
	+ **Gateway 1 (Otherwise):** PO Number Present
		- **Sequence Flow:** Proceed to Activity 3

* Mary logs the invoice into the accounting system.

**Activity 4: Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Confirmation (Mary)**
