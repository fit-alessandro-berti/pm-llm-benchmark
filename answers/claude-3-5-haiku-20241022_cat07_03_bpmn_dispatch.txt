This is a business process diagram (BPMN) showing a shipping and logistics workflow across three swim lanes: Logistics, Secretary, and Warehouse. The process starts with "Ship goods" and follows through several key steps:

1. In the Secretary lane:
- The process begins with clarifying shipment method
- Checks if special handling is required
- Involves checking insurance requirements using customer information
- Gets offers from logistics companies and selects one
- Includes writing package labels

2. In the Logistics lane:
- Handles parcel insurance when necessary

3. In the Warehouse lane:
- Packages goods (with a 48-hour timer)
- Notifies customer about delays if necessary
- Fills out shipment paperwork
- Moves package to pickup area
- Ends with "Shipment prepared"

The diagram uses standard BPMN notation including gateways (diamond shapes), tasks (rounded rectangles), and flow arrows connecting the different elements. It clearly shows the workflow dependencies and decision points in the shipping process.
