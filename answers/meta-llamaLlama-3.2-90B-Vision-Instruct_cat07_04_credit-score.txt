The provided visualization is a flowchart that illustrates the process of credit scoring, which is divided into two main sections: credit scoring (front end) and scoring service. The flowchart is composed of various shapes, including rectangles, diamonds, and circles, each representing a specific step or decision in the process.

**Credit Scoring (Front End)**

*   The flowchart begins with a rectangle labeled "scoring request received," which indicates the initiation of the credit scoring process.
*   The next step is a diamond-shaped decision point, where the system determines whether the request is valid or not. If it is invalid, the process ends, and an error message is sent back to the user.
*   If the request is valid, the system proceeds to the next step, which involves sending a credit score request to the scoring service.
*   The scoring service then generates a credit score based on the user's credit history and other relevant factors.
*   Once the credit score is generated, it is sent back to the front end, where it is received and processed.
*   The final step in the front-end section is to report the delay, which involves calculating the time it took to complete the credit scoring process.

**Scoring Service**

*   The scoring service section begins with a rectangle labeled "scoring request received," which indicates that the scoring service has received a request from the front end.
*   The next step is a diamond-shaped decision point, where the system determines whether the compute credit score (level 1) is available or not. If it is available, the process proceeds to the next step; otherwise, the system reports a delay.
*   If the compute credit score (level 1) is available, the system generates a credit score based on the user's credit history and other relevant factors.
*   Once the credit score is generated, it is sent back to the front end, where it is received and processed.
*   The final step in the scoring service section is to send the credit score to the front end, where it is used to make a decision about the user's creditworthiness.

Overall, the flowchart provides a clear and concise overview of the credit scoring process, highlighting the key steps involved and the decisions made at each stage. By following the flowchart, users can gain a better understanding of how credit scores are generated and used in the decision-making process.
