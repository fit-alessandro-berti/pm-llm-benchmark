Based on the data provided, the process appears to involve the handling of containers and their associated activities. Here's a high-level description of the process:
1. A customer order is registered, resulting in the creation of a transport document.
2. The transport document is used to book vehicles, which in turn results in the order of empty containers.
3. Empty containers are picked up and loaded onto trucks.
4. The trucks are driven to the terminal, where they are weighed and loaded with containers.
5. The containers are loaded onto vehicles and then weighed.
6. The vehicles are then loaded onto trucks, which are driven to the loading bay.
7. The containers are then placed in stock or loaded onto vehicles, depending on the type of container.
8. The process may involve rescheduling containers, depending on the availability of vehicles and resources.
Overall, the process involves the movement of containers from the loading bay to the terminal, with multiple intermediate steps and activities involved in each step.
