This visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** that describes the **shipment preparation workflow** for a computer hardware shop. It is organized into **three swimlanes**, representing different roles or departments involved in the shipping process:  

1. **Logistics**  
2. **Dispatch of goods Computer Hardware Shop Secretary**  
3. **Warehouse**

---

### **Process Flow Breakdown**  

1. **Start Event**  
   - The process begins with the event **"Ship goods"** in the Secretary lane.

---

2. **Clarify Shipment Method**  
   - The secretary clarifies how the items should be shipped.  
   - A decision point checks if **special handling** is required:  
     - **No Special Handling**  Process goes to **Check if insurance is required.**  
     - **Special Handling**  Secretary requests **3 offers from logistic companies** and then **selects one to place an order.**

---

3. **Insurance Handling**  
   - Using customer information, the secretary checks if insurance is required:  
     - If required  **Insure parcel**, then proceed to **Write package label.**  
     - If not required  **Directly proceed to Write package label.**

---

4. **Parallel Processing**  
   - While the paperwork and logistics are being handled by the secretary, the **Warehouse** packages the goods.  
   - If packaging takes longer than **48 hours**, the customer is notified about the delay.  

---

5. **Merging Paths**  
   - After logistics, package labeling, insurance, and packaging are completed, all flows merge.  
   - The next steps are:  
     - **Fill out shipment paperwork**  
     - **Move package to pickup area**

---

6. **End Event**  
   - The process concludes with **"Shipment prepared."**

---

### **Key Features of This Workflow**  
- **Role separation:** Logistics handles insurance, offers, and labels; Warehouse handles packaging and movement.  
- **Decision points:** Special handling required  external logistics offers; insurance required  additional insurance step.  
- **Timer event:** Packaging must be completed within 48 hours, otherwise customer notification is triggered.  
- **Synchronization:** Multiple parallel tasks converge before final shipment preparation.

 This diagram depicts a **well-structured order shipment process**, ensuring that special requirements, insurance, and delays are systematically managed across different departments.  

Would you like me to **summarize this flow into a step-by-step textual workflow** (so it can be used as a standard operating procedure)?
