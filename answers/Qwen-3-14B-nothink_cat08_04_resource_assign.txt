# **Comprehensive Process Mining Approach to Optimize Resource Assignment at TechSolve Solutions**

---

## **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

### **Agent and Tier Performance Analysis**

To understand resource behavior and assignment patterns, we will leverage **process mining techniques** to extract key performance metrics and behavior patterns from the event log data:

#### **Key Metrics to Analyze:**

- **Workload Distribution:** Calculate the number of tickets handled per agent, per tier, and per time period (e.g., daily, weekly). This helps identify over/underloaded agents or teams.
- **Processing Times:** Measure the time taken by agents to resolve tickets at each tier. Compare L1, L2, and L3 resolution times to identify bottlenecks.
- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate:** Track how many tickets are resolved at L1 without escalation. This is a critical KPI for L1 performance.
- **Escalation Frequency:** Count how often tickets are escalated from L1 to L2/L3, and whether they are resolved at the correct tier.
- **Ticket Type and Skill Matching:** Analyze the frequency of tickets per category and required skill, and compare them to the skill sets of agents at each tier.
- **Agent Skill Utilization:** Track the proportion of tickets handled by each agent relative to their skill set. This helps determine if agents are being underutilized or overqualified.

#### **Process Mining Techniques:**

- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** This identifies how often agents interact with each other (e.g., reassign, escalate) and which agents frequently work on the same types of tickets.
- **Social Network Analysis (SNA):** Build a network of agent interactions (e.g., reassignments, escalations) to identify key players and communication bottlenecks.
- **Role Discovery:** Automatically detect agent roles (e.g., L1, L2, L3 specialists) based on their behavior patterns in the event log, which can help validate or refine current tiering logic.
- **Case Attribute Correlation:** Use process mining tools to correlate ticket attributes (e.g., priority, category, required skill) with agent behavior and resolution time.

#### **Skill Utilization Analysis:**

Using the event log, we can analyze:

- The **distribution of required skills** across tickets.
- The **overlap between agent skills and ticket requirements**.
- The **frequency with which agents are assigned tasks that match their skill sets**.
- Whether **highly skilled agents are being used appropriately** (e.g., assigned to complex or high-priority tickets) or if they are often assigned to simpler tasks.

This analysis will reveal whether **specialists are being utilized effectively** or if they are being **underutilized or misassigned** due to inefficient routing logic.

## **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

### **Bottleneck and Problem Identification**

Using the metrics and patterns identified in the first step, we can pinpoint the following resource-related issues:

#### **Bottlenecks Caused by Skill Shortages:**

- Identify **skills that are in high demand** (e.g., App-CRM, DB-SQL) and compare them to the number of agents with those skills.
- Calculate the **average time a ticket spends waiting for an agent with the correct skill** to be assigned. This helps quantify the impact of skill shortages.

#### **Delays from Reassignments and Escalations:**

- Calculate the **average time delay caused by each reassignment or escalation** (e.g., time from escalation to new assignment).
- Identify **reassignment patterns** (e.g., tickets frequently re-assigned between L2 and L3 agents) and assess whether these are **necessary or avoidable**.
- Use **event log timestamps** to measure the **impact of reassignments on resolution time**.

#### **Impact of Incorrect Initial Assignments:**

- Track the **number of L1 tickets that are escalated due to incorrect initial assignment**.
- Correlate **L1 agent skills with ticket requirements** to determine if L1 agents are being assigned tasks that match their capabilities or not.

#### **Overloaded/Underperforming Agents:**

- Identify agents with **excessively high workloads** (e.g., >50 tickets/day) or **low resolution rates**.
- Use **agent performance dashboards** to compare individual agent performance against tier averages.

#### **Correlation with SLA Breaches:**

- Map **SLA breaches** (e.g., tickets not resolved within the agreed time) to **agent behavior** (e.g., long processing times, reassignments, skill mismatches).
- Use **predictive analytics** to identify which types of tickets or agent behaviors are most likely to result in SLA breaches.

### **Quantifying the Impact:**

- **Average delay per reassignment:** Calculate the time difference between the start of a ticket and the time it was resolved, excluding the time spent on reassignments.
- **Percentage of SLA breaches due to skill mismatch:** Use classification models or logistic regression to determine the probability that a ticket was SLA-breached due to skill mismatch.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes:**

#### **Inefficient Assignment Rules:**

- The current **round-robin** and **manual escalation** logic may not consider **agent skills, workload, or ticket complexity**, leading to poor matches and delays.

#### **Inaccurate or Incomplete Agent Skill Profiles:**

- If agents’ **skill sets are not accurately recorded** in the system, the assignment logic may not route tickets to the most appropriate agent.

#### **Poor Ticket Categorization:**

- If **ticket categories and required skills are not correctly identified**, then even the best assignment logic will fail to match tickets to the right agents.

#### **Lack of Real-Time Workload Visibility:**

- Without real-time visibility into **agent availability and workload**, tickets may be assigned to agents who are already overloaded or not available.

#### **L1 Agent Empowerment and Training:**

- If **L1 agents are not adequately trained** or empowered to resolve certain types of tickets, this leads to **unnecessary escalations** and delays.

### **Analytical Techniques for Root Cause Identification:**

- **Variant Analysis:** Compare the **process paths** of tickets that were resolved efficiently with those that had multiple reassignments or SLA breaches. Identify **differences in assignment patterns, agent skills, and ticket characteristics**.
- **Decision Mining:** Analyze the **assignment decisions** made by dispatchers and agents (e.g., who assigned which ticket to which agent) to understand the logic behind poor assignments and identify rules that lead to inefficiencies.

## **4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting**

- **Issue Addressed:** Skill mismatch and underutilization of specialists.
- **How It Works:** Use **ticket required skills** and **agent skill profiles** to route tickets to the **most appropriate agent**, weighted by **proficiency level** (e.g., agent with "App-CRM" as a primary skill vs. secondary skill).
- **Data Required:**
  - Ticket required skills.
  - Agent skill sets with proficiency levels.
  - Historical resolution success rates per skill.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Reduced reassignments and escalations.
  - Higher first-call resolution rates.
  - Better utilization of specialized agents.

### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**

- **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution and over/underloaded agents.
- **How It Works:** Develop a **dynamic assignment algorithm** that considers:
  - Current agent workload (number of active tickets, time since last assignment).
  - Agent availability.
  - Ticket priority and complexity.
- **Data Required:**
  - Real-time agent workload metrics.
  - Historical resolution times.
  - Ticket priority and complexity scores.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - More even workload distribution.
  - Reduced agent burnout and stress.
  - Faster resolution times due to less queuing and waiting.

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Characteristics**

- **Issue Addressed:** Inefficient initial assignment by L1 and dispatchers.
- **How It Works:** Use **machine learning models** trained on historical ticket data to **predict required skills and complexity** at the time of ticket creation. This can be used to **automatically assign tickets to the most appropriate agent**.
- **Data Required:**
  - Ticket descriptions, categories, and resolved skills.
  - Agent skill sets and resolution success rates.
  - Historical resolution times.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Fewer incorrect initial assignments.
  - Reduced escalations and reassignments.
  - Improved SLA compliance.

## **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

### **Simulation of Assignment Strategies:**

- Use **business process simulation tools** (e.g., ProM, Bonita, or custom simulation models) to:
  - Model the current process with its inefficiencies.
  - Introduce the proposed strategies into the simulated process.
  - Compare **resolution times, SLA compliance, reassignment rates, and workload distribution** between the current and simulated processes.
- This allows for **risk-free evaluation** of the impact of each strategy before full implementation.

### **Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan:**

- **Process Mining Dashboards:** Implement real-time dashboards using tools like **Process Mining platforms (e.g., Celonis, UiPath Process Mining)**.
- **Key KPIs to Monitor:**
  - **SLA Compliance Rate** (e.g., % of tickets resolved within SLA).
  - **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate** (L1).
  - **Reassignment Rate** (per ticket, per agent).
  - **Average Resolution Time** by tier.
  - **Agent Workload Distribution** (tickets per agent, time per agent).
  - **Skill Match Rate** (percentage of tickets assigned to agents with matching skills).
- **Process Views to Track:**
  - **Ticket Flow Maps** (showing assignment and escalation paths).
  - **Agent Interaction Networks** (to detect bottlenecks).
  - **Skill Utilization Heatmaps** (to identify under/overutilized skills).
