As an expert in process mining, I will transform the provided Windows activity log into a structured event log suitable for analysis.

The core challenge here is **Case Identification**. In a desktop activity log, a logical "case" often corresponds to the active manipulation or creation of a specific document or task, which typically lasts until the user switches context significantly or closes the main artifact of that task.

For this transformation, I will define a **Case** based on the primary, focused document/application thread. A new case will generally start when the user begins substantial work on a document that appears distinct from the current sequence, or when a major context switch occurs followed by dedicated editing activity.

## Logic Explanation

### Case Identification Strategy

I used the **Document/Artifact Focus** approach to define process cases:

1.  **Initial Focus:** The sequence begins with `Quarterly_Report.docx` being focused, but the very next event immediately switches to `Document1.docx`. Since significant activity (typing) occurs on `Document1.docx`, this marks the start of **Case\_1001**. The initial focus on the other document is treated as minor preparation/context setting leading into the first main case activity.
2.  **Context Switching:** A case generally concludes when the user switches applications *and* the subsequent application begins a new, distinct work pattern (e.g., editing vs. communicating).
    *   **Case\_1001 ends** upon the `SWITCH` to Chrome for email.
    *   **Case\_1002 (Email)** ends after the email is sent, followed by a switch to Acrobat for review.
    *   **Case\_1003 (PDF Review)** ends when the focus switches to Excel.
    *   **Case\_1004 (Excel Update)** ends when the user switches back to Word, specifically referencing the previously edited `Document1.docx`. Since `Document1.docx` is being manipulated again but in a different context (referencing a budget update), it starts a new sequence/case (**Case\_1005**).
    *   **Case\_1005 ends** when the document is closed, leading to the final dedicated drafting session (**Case\_1006**).

### Activity Naming Standardization

The raw actions were aggregated into meaningful process steps:

| Raw Action(s) | Derived Activity Name | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FOCUS, TYPING (Word/Excel) | Document\_Open\_Edit / Data\_Update / Document\_Drafting | Covers initial interaction, data entry, and drafting where content creation is the primary goal tied to a specific file. |
| SAVE | Document\_Save | Standardized saving action. |
| SWITCH (Word/Excel to Word) | Document\_Edit\_Reference | Used specifically when returning to an existing document to incorporate information from a previously updated case (linking the Excel update to the Word document). |
| FOCUS, SCROLL, CLICK, HIGHLIGHT (in Acrobat) | Document\_Review / Document\_Annotation | Actions related to reading and marking up a static document. |
| CLICK, TYPING (in Chrome) | Communication\_Handle / Communication\_Input / Communication\_Send | Grouping actions related to processing an email (opening, reading, replying, sending). |
| CLOSE | Document\_Close | Standardized closure action. |

This transformation results in an event log where activities describe *what* the user was trying to achieve (e.g., Drafting, Communicating, Reviewing) rather than just *how* the operating system registered the input (e.g., FOCUS, TYPING).
