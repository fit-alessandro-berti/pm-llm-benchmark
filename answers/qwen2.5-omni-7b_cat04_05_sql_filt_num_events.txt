```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

This query first identifies all `case_id`s that have six or fewer events by counting the occurrences of each `case_id` using the `GROUP BY` clause and applying the `HAVING` clause to filter those with counts less than or equal to six. Then it selects all rows from `event_log` where the `case_id` is among those identified earlier, effectively returning only the events from cases that meet the criteria.
