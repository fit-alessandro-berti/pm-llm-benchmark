Based on the numerical patterns in the sensor readings, I can identify **three distinct manufacturing activities** performed by Machine M1:

## Activity 1: **Material Transport & Setup** (Events #1-3, #13-15)
**Rationale:**
- **Low/constant sensor values**: Temperature (20-21°C), pressure (1 bar), vibration (0-0 Hz), material flow (0 units/s), and energy (0.40-0.50 kWh)
- **Machine is idle or in standby**: All sensors show minimal activity
- **Temporary energy reduction** from 0.50 to 0.40 kWh suggests efficiency mode
- **Stable conditions** indicate preparation phase before active operation

## Activity 2: **Metal Cutting Operation** (Events #4-6)
**Rationale:**
- **Rapid parameter changes**: Temperature jumps from 20°C to 58°C, vibration increases dramatically from 0 to 38 Hz, material flow increases from 0 to 5 units/s
- **Significant energy consumption** (2.00-3.00 kWh) indicates high-power operation
- **Tool movement**: Position progresses from 5mm to 10mm, showing cutting tool advancement
- **Increasing temperature and vibration** are classic signatures of metal cutting/friction-based operations

## Activity 3: **Assembly/Finishing Work** (Events #7-12)
**Rationale:**
- **Moderate conditions**: Temperature drops to 40°C, vibration decreases to 10 Hz, energy reduces to 2.00 kWh
- **Decreased material flow** (2 units/s) suggests precision assembly rather than bulk processing
- **Continued tool movement** from 15mm to 20mm indicates finishing operations rather than initial cutting
- **Lower vibration and temperature** indicate more controlled, assembly-type operations compared to heavy cutting

## Process Flow:
**Material Transport  Metal Cutting  Assembly/Finishing**
(Events #1-3  #4-6  #7-12) followed by return to **standby mode** (Events #13-15)

This analysis reveals a complete manufacturing cycle on Machine M1, progressing from setup through heavy cutting operations to precision assembly, before returning to standby state.
