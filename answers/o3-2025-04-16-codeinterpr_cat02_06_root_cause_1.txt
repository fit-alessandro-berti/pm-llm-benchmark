1. Cases with long cycle times  

• Fast “normal” tickets (baseline)  
  – Case 101   : 2 h 15 min  
  – Case 103   : 1 h 20 min  

• Clearly slower tickets  
  – Case 102   : 25 h 10 min ( 11× Case 103)  
  – Case 104   : 24 h 10 min ( 11× Case 103)  
  – Case 105   : 49 h 05 min ( 22× Case 103)  

2. Main delay patterns found in the slow cases  

a. Escalations to the Level-2 team  
   • Case 102 – 2 h 30 min from “Assign L1”  “Escalate” and another 2 h 30 min from “Escalate”  “Investigate” (Level-2 starts).  
   • Case 105 – only 35 min to raise the escalation, but then a 28 h gap before the Level-2 investigation begins.  
   Effect: tickets that were escalated ran 1-2 working days longer than the non-escalated tickets.

b. Long waiting time between “Investigate Issue” and “Resolve Ticket”  
   • 19 h for Cases 102, 104, 105 (overnight carry-over).  
   Suggests investigations finish late in the day, resolution is postponed to the next shift or requires customer confirmation/parts.

c. Delayed start of the first investigation  
   • Case 104 – 3 h 30 min from “Assign L1”  “Investigate Issue” even though no escalation occurred.  
   Points to Level-1 capacity or prioritisation problems.

d. Accumulation of both patterns  
   • Case 105 combines escalation wait + overnight wait, generating the longest overall cycle time.

3. Why these factors increase cycle time & recommendations  

Factor 1 – Escalation queue  
• Level-2 specialists appear to be a scarce, single-shift resource. When an escalation arrives late morning it is picked up only after several hours or the next day.  
Recommendations  
  – Introduce a clear SLA for accepting escalations (e.g., <1 h).  
  – Provide staggered staffing or on-call Level-2 coverage in the late afternoon/evening.  
  – Let triage decide immediately whether Level-2 is needed and route the ticket there directly, skipping “Assign L1 + Escalate” hand-off.

Factor 2 – Overnight wait after investigation  
• If the ticket is technically solved but the formal “Resolve” activity is done next day, the case keeps accumulating turnaround time.  
Recommendations  
  – Allow agents to perform “Resolve” in the same shift once the fix is confirmed, or give them authority to close automatically when no customer response is required.  
  – Automate routine resolutions (knowledge-base scripts, auto-patches) so the end-of-day backlog is reduced.

Factor 3 – Slow start of investigation in L1  
• Example Case 104 shows a mid-day start although the ticket was ready at 09:30. This indicates queueing within Level-1.  
Recommendations  
  – Monitor “Assign  Investigate” delay; trigger alerts after 30 min.  
  – Use skill-based routing so the ticket goes directly to an available agent rather than a generic queue.  
  – Re-balance staffing in the morning peak.

General process improvements  
1. Add real-time dashboards that show ageing tickets and waiting-time per activity.  
2. Define KPIs not only for total resolution time but also for intermediate waits (e.g., “escalation acceptance time”).  
3. Analyse a larger log to confirm whether the identified patterns are systemic; if so, run targeted capacity-planning or automation initiatives.

By focusing on quicker escalation handling, reducing overnight hold-ups, and ensuring prompt start of investigations, the organisation can bring the slow-running tickets (24–49 h) back in line with the fast-track ones ( 2 h).
