Certainly! Below is a detailed, structured approach tailored to Speedy Parcels’ scenario, leveraging process mining principles for logistics and last-mile delivery optimization.

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration

**Sources:**

- **GPS Trackers:** Continuous location and status data (timestamped)  
- **Driver Scanners:** Event-driven delivery milestones per package  
- **Dispatch System:** Planned routes, vehicle-load assignments, time windows  
- **Maintenance Logs:** Scheduled/unscheduled maintenance details per vehicle  

---

### Steps for Data Integration into an Event Log

1. **Define a common "Case ID":**  
   - Use **Vehicle-Day** as a primary case (e.g., `V12-20241205`) to represent each vehicle’s operational day.  
   - For package-specific events, either include the package ID as a subcase or attribute in the log to enable drill-down.  
   - Maintenance events are tied to vehicles and timestamps, potentially as parallel or nested cases.

2. **Harmonize Timestamp Formats and Time Zones:**  
   - Standardize all timestamps to a common format and time zone to enable event sequence alignment.

3. **Align Event Types and Activities:**  
   - Create consistent activity labels across data sources, e.g., map GPS low-speed events to ‘Traffic Delay’, GPS idle at depot to ‘Depot Waiting’, scanner events to delivery-related activities.

4. **Event Enrichment / Annotation:**  
   - Enrich GPS events with semantic statuses (`Moving`, `Idle`, `Traffic Jam`) by thresholding speed or status flags.  
   - Link package IDs from the scanner to relate customer deliveries with the respective vehicle route and time.

5. **Event Sequencing and Ordering:**  
   - Merge streams by timestamp to form a combined trace of activities per vehicle-day.

---

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Data Volume and Noise:** GPS data are high-frequency and voluminous; filtering out irrelevant data (e.g., minute-by-minute location in depot) is required.  
- **Event Granularity Mismatch:** Delivery scanner events are discrete milestones, GPS data are continuous; synchronizing these requires interpolation or windowing.  
- **Inconsistent or Missing Data:** Some deliveries may lack scanner events; GPS may lack location precision due to urban canyons—must handle gaps robustly.  
- **Case and Event Correlation Across Sources:** Linking package events to vehicle and driver reliably if identifiers are inconsistent.

---

### Process Discovery

Using the integrated event log:

- **Apply process discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner, Heuristic Miner):**  

  - Discover the *actual* end-to-end process from ‘Start Shift’  ‘Depart Depot’  [sequence of deliveries (arrive, delivery success/failure, depart)]  *possible unscheduled stops* (e.g., maintenance, traffic delay)  ‘Return Depot’  ‘End Shift’.
  
- **Model Components:**

  - Delivery sequences  
  - Travel segments between stops (idle, moving, stopped)  
  - Deviations like unplanned stops (unscheduled maintenance, engine warning events)  
  - Branching for delivery success/failure  
  - Wait times, traffic slow zones, dwell times  

- Integrate timing and frequency info as annotations.

---

### Conformance Checking

- **Planned vs. Actual Alignment:**

  - Extract planned route sequences from Dispatch (ordered list of stops with time windows).  
  - Align discovered traces to planned cases to identify deviations.

- **Deviation Types to Detect:**

  - **Sequence Deviations:**  
    - Skipped or reordered stops (missed deliveries or out-of-order stops).  
  - **Unplanned Stops:**  
    - Detected by GPS or maintenance logs (e.g., engine warning, extra breaks).  
  - **Timing Differences:**  
    - Early/late arrivals concerning proposed delivery windows.  
    - Longer than expected dwell or travel times.  

- **Metrics:**  
  - Trace fitness and precision scores.  
  - Frequency and duration of deviations per vehicle/route.

- **Visualization:**  
  - Conformance heatmaps highlighting delays and discrepancies.  
  - Enrich with geo-mapping to spatially locate deviations.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI                            | Definition / Calculation from Event Log                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **On-Time Delivery Rate**       | % deliveries completed within planned customer time windows (compare actual arrival/delivery time vs. planned window) |
| **Average Time per Delivery Stop** | Average dwell time at each customer location (`Depart Customer` timestamp  `Arrive Customer`) |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio** | Ratio of driving/travel time to delivery service time per vehicle-day or route    |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/package** | Estimate fuel usage based on speed and idling inferred from GPS + known vehicle fuel efficiency (may require telemetry) |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate**    | Active driving and delivery time / total shift length (minus idle, breaks, maintenance) |
| **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays** | Number and cumulated duration of low-speed or idle segments detected via GPS (e.g., speed <5 km/h) |
| **Rate of Failed Deliveries**   | % of ‘Delivery Failed (Attempted)’ events over total delivery attempts             |

---

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques

- **Performance-annotated Process Models:**  
  - Use timestamp data to color or annotate activities/states with duration metrics; identify activities/stages with disproportionately high waiting or processing times.

- **Variant Analysis:**  
  - Compare process variants by route, driver, or vehicle — identify particularly slow or inefficient variants.

- **Cluster Analysis on Delivery Stops:**  
  - Aggregate stops by location/time to detect hotspots of delays or frequent failures.

- **Temporal Analysis:**  
  - Perform time-of-day or day-of-week analyses to see when traffic or delays peak.

- **Correlation with Maintenance and Unplanned Events:**  
  - Overlay maintenance logs with GPS and delivery logs to see if vehicle issues coincide with bottlenecks.

- **Driver Comparisons:**  
  - Analyze delivery and route performance per driver to identify skill or behavior differences.

---

### Quantifying Impact

- **Delay Contribution per Bottleneck:**  
  - Calculate average additional time incurred at identified bottlenecks.

- **Cost Estimates:**  
  - Translate excess time and vehicle idling into fuel and labor costs.

- **Delivery Impact:**  
  - Cross-reference bottlenecks with late or failed deliveries to assess operational impact.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### Potential Root Causes and Process Mining Usage

| Root Cause                              | Explanation & Process Mining Approach                                         |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Suboptimal Route Planning**           | Static planned routes may ignore real-time or historical traffic patterns. Use conformance checking to identify frequent route deviations; variant clustering helps detect recurring inefficiencies due to poor route choices. |
| **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations** | Compare planned vs. actual travel times per segment, identify systemic underestimations. Use timestamp intervals between ‘Depart Customer’ and next ‘Arrive Customer’ or GPS movement data. |
| **Traffic Congestion Impact**           | Use GPS speed profiles to detect low-speed segments and correlate with delivery delays; overlay with time-of-day and location data to identify traffic hotspots. |
| **High Variability in Service Times**   | Analyze dwell times at customers, segment by package type, driver, or location; high variance might reflect customer behavior or inefficient processes (e.g., difficulty finding parking or package scanning delays). |
| **Vehicle Breakdowns / Maintenance Needs** | Align unscheduled stops and engine warnings from GPS and maintenance logs with delivery delays; observe impact on routes and overall delivery times. |
| **Driver Behavior / Skill Differences** | Compare delivery success rates, travel times, and delays by driver; leverage process variants and performance annotations. Identify drivers causing excessive idling or deviations. |
| **Failed Delivery Attempts**             | Analyze frequency and causes of failures (e.g., customer absence, wrong address); determine re-delivery rates and associated extra vehicle usage. |

---

### Validating Root Causes via Process Mining

- **Variant Analysis:** Separate traces by successful vs. failed deliveries or efficient vs. delayed routes to see behavioral differences.  
- **Correlate Traffic Data with Delays:** Overlay GPS-derived low-speed events on late deliveries to confirm impact.  
- **Dwell Time Analytics:** Histogram and boxplots of stop durations, segmented by location types or drivers.  
- **Maintenance Impact Analysis:** Calculate average delay duration post-maintenance events vs. normal operations.  
- **Driver Performance Dashboards:** Interactive visualization by driver ID showing KPIs side-by-side.
