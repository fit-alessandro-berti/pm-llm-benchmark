### **1. Identify Cases with Significant Delays**

First, we calculate the **total duration** (lead time) for each case by subtracting the `Submit Claim` timestamp from the `Close Claim` timestamp.

| Case ID | Submit Time          | Close Time           | Total Duration |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30     | **1 hour 30 mins** |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00     | **1 day 1 hour 55 mins** |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30     | **2 days 20 mins** |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45     | **1 hour 25 mins** |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30     | **3 days 5 hours 5 mins** |

**Observation**: Cases **2002, 2003, and 2005** take significantly longer than **2001 and 2004**.

### **2. Analyze Attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity)**

We now examine the attributes of the delayed cases to deduce root causes.

#### **Case 2002 (Medium Complexity, Region B)**
- **Key Issue**: A long delay between `Evaluate Claim` (09:45) and `Approve Claim` (10:00 next day).
- **Attribute Correlations**:
  - **Region B**: No immediate red flag, as Case 2004 (Low Complexity, Region B) was quick.
  - **Medium Complexity**: Cases with medium/high complexity sometimes require `Request Additional Documents`, but here it only happens once (14:00 on the same day).
  - **Resource**: `Adjuster_Lisa` handled `Evaluate Claim` and `Request Additional Documents`, but no backlog or inefficiency is apparent.
  
**Possible Root Cause**:  
The delay likely stems from **managerial approval bottleneck**—`Manager_Ann` approved the claim only next morning, possibly due to workload or availability.

---

#### **Case 2003 (High Complexity, Region A)**
- **Key Issues**:
  - Two `Request Additional Documents` (11:00 and 17:00 on the same day).
  - Large delay from last request (17:00) to `Approve Claim` (~23 hours later).
- **Attribute Correlations**:
  - **High Complexity**: Strong correlation with multiple document requests.
  - **Region A**: Appears efficient for low-complexity cases (Case 2001), but struggles with high-complexity ones.
  - **Resource**: `Adjuster_Mike` handled multiple document requests, but no clear inefficiency—just repetitions due to complexity.

**Possible Root Cause**:  
The **high complexity required multiple document requests**, and the **manager (`Manager_Bill`)** took ~23 hours to review and approve, possibly due to backlog or prioritization.

---

#### **Case 2005 (High Complexity, Region B)**
- **Key Issues**:
  - Three `Request Additional Documents` (11:30, 17:00, next day 15:00).
  - Very long delay (~19 hours) before approval after the last document request.
- **Attribute Correlations**:
  - **High Complexity**: Stronger correlation with multiple requests than medium complexity.
  - **Region B**: Compared to Case 2002 (Medium, Region B), delays are worse.
  - **Resource**: `Adjuster_Lisa` handled multiple requests inefficiently—seems unable to resolve documentation issues in one go.
  
**Possible Root Cause**:  
- **Multiple document requests** suggest poor initial evaluation or unclear customer documentation.  
- **Manager (`Manager_Bill`)** delays persist (similar to Case 2003).  
- **Region B** may have weaker support for high-complexity claims.

---

### **3. General Trends**

- **High Complexity = More Document Requests**: Cases 2003 and 2005 had 2 and 3 requests, respectively, leading to delays.  
- **Managerial Bottlenecks**: `Manager_Ann` and `Manager_Bill` often delayed approval, especially after document requests.  
- **Region B**: Performed okay for low complexity (Case 2004) but poorly for medium/high (Cases 2002, 2005), possibly due to resource constraints.  
- **Resource Assignments**:  
  - `Adjuster_Lisa` (Region B) struggled more with document requests than `Adjuster_Mike` (Region A).  
  - `CSR_Paul` (Region B) handled cases quickly but `Adjuster_Lisa` appears less efficient.

### **4. Root Causes & Recommendations**

| Root Cause | Affected Cases | Explanation | Recommendation |
|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Managerial Approval Delays** | 2002, 2003, 2005 | Approval often delayed by 10+ hours post-evaluation/documentation. | Implement approval SLAs; assign dedicated approvers for urgent claims. |
| **Multiple Document Requests (High Complexity)** | 2003, 2005 | High-complexity claims require multiple clarifications, expanding timelines. | Train adjusters to better evaluate documentation needs upfront. |
| **Regional Resource Constraints (Region B)** | 2002, 2005 | Cases in Region B with medium/high complexity take 2x longer than Region A. | Audit resource allocation in Region B; provide additional training. |
| **Inefficient Adjuster Handling (Adjuster_Lisa)** | 2002, 2005 | Requires multiple follow-ups for documentation vs. `Adjuster_Mike`. | Reassign high-complexity claims to more efficient adjusters. |

### **Conclusion**

- **Longest Cases (2003, 2005)**: Suffer from **high complexity**, **managerial delays**, and **regional inefficiencies**.  
- **Mitigation Strategies**:  
  - Streamline document collection with clear guidelines.  
  - Set SLA for managerial approvals.  
  - Improve resource allocation for high-complexity claims.  
  - Cross-train adjusters to reduce repeated requests.
