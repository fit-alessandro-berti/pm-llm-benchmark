Based on the process variants and their execution times provided, I will assume the domain is related to healthcare or medical treatment. I will also assume that the "protected group" refers to a group that receives some form of special protection or consideration, while the "unprotected group" does not have this same protection.

The main differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group are as follows:

1. Frequency of process variants: The process variants for the protected group have lower frequencies compared to the unprotected group, which suggests that the unprotected group is more likely to follow the standard treatment process.

2. Expert Examination: The protected group has more instances where Expert Examination is part of the treatment process. This could imply that the protected group has access to more specialized care or expertise.

3. Thorough Examination: The protected group has more instances where Thorough Examination is part of the treatment process. This might indicate that the protected group receives more comprehensive care.

4. Treatment unsuccessful: The protected group has fewer instances where Treatment unsuccessful occurs compared to the unprotected group. This could imply that the protected group has a higher success rate in their treatment.

5. Discharge: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of Discharge without further treatment or examination compared to the protected group. This might indicate that the unprotected group's treatment is less thorough or that they are being discharged prematurely.

6. Execution time: The execution times for the protected group are generally higher than those of the unprotected group. This could imply that the protected group receives more extensive and time-consuming treatment, possibly due to their special needs or requirements.

In summary, the protected group seems to receive more specialized, comprehensive, and time-consuming care, with more expert examinations and fewer instances of treatment failure or premature discharge. The unprotected group, on the other hand, appears to follow the standard treatment process more frequently but with a higher likelihood of treatment failure and premature discharge.
