**Rationale for Naming Changes:**

1. **Initial Document Check (C001) vs Verify Documents**:
   - Originally named `Verify Documents`, this activity appears twice with slightly different intentions in the same case. The first occurrence sets up the verification process, while the second confirms after receiving additional documents from the customer. Renaming to 'Initial Document Check' for the first instance clarifies its role as initiating the verification, and 'Final Document Review' for the second highlights it occurs after document submission by the customer.

2. **Contact Customer (C001) vs Call Customer**:
   - The activity involves interacting with the customer, but their purpose differs—initial request for information versus follow-up to address gaps or confirmations. Thus, renaming to 'Contact Customer' captures this distinction in communication intent.

3. **Upload Supporting Docs (C001) vs Submit Additional**:
   - Initially labeled 'Submit Additional', this activity now refers to the customer's action of providing necessary documents. Renamed to 'Upload Supporting Docs' specifies this is a customer-driven upload action.

4. **Identity Verification (C002) vs Verify Documents**:
   - For case C002, 'Identity Verification' distinguishes the agent’s initial document check phase, differentiating it from other potential verification steps later in the process.

5. **Clarify Account Issues (C002) vs Call Customer**:
   - Indicates a communication step aimed specifically at resolving account discrepancies, distinguishing it as clarification-focused rather than general customer contact.

6. **Internal Account Adjustment (C002) vs Call Customer**:
   - Specifies the adjustment is internal following external communication, thus renaming to 'Internal Account Adjustment' avoids confusion with customer contact activities.

7. **Confirm Changes (C002) vs Call Customer**:
   - Reflects a final confirmation step with the customer after adjustments, clarifying its communication nature beyond general calling.

8. **Initiate In-Branch Request (C003) vs Initiate Request**:
   - For case C003 initiated at a branch, contextualize as 'In-Branch Request' to differentiate from online/web portal initiations seen in other cases.

9. **Physical ID Verification (C003) vs Verify Documents**:
   - Emphasizes physical examination of documents for C003, distinguishing it from document verification conducted via digital means in other scenarios.

10. **Retrieve Customer (C003) vs Contact Customer**:
    - Signals an action to locate and engage the customer after they left during a process step, making 'Retrieve Customer' more precise.

11. **Internal Correction (C003) vs Adjust Account**:
    - Clarifies that this is an internal adjustment due to missing information, hence named 'Internal Correction'.

12. **Re-verification (C003) vs Verify Documents**:
    - Indicates a second review of documents post-adjustment, signified by 'Re-verification' for clarity within the context of case C003's branch process.

These renames aim to eliminate ambiguity and accurately reflect each activity’s specific role in its particular workflow stage or resource involved, providing clearer insights into the support process flow across diverse cases.
