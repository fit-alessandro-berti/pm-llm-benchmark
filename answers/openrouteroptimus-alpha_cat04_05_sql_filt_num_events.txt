Certainly! Here is the DuckDB SQL query to achieve your requirements:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
;
```

**Explanation:**

- The subquery selects `case_id`s with six or fewer events (`HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`).
- The outer query returns all events from only those `case_id`s.
- This ensures all events from cases with more than six events are excluded.
