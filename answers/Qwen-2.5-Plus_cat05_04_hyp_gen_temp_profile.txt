### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive to Approve (R to P)**: The average time is around 25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation, suggesting a rigid approval process that may not align with business logic.
2. **Approve to Notify (P to N)**: There is a long average delay of 7 days between approval and notification, coupled with a high standard deviation of 2 days, indicating inconsistent timing patterns.
3. **Assign to Close (A to C)**: The average closure time after assignment is only 2 hours, which seems unusually quick and might suggest premature claim closures.
4. **Evaluate to Notify (E to N)**: The transition from evaluation to notification happens in just 5 minutes on average, which could indicate rushed or skipped steps.

### Hypotheses on Possible Reasons for Anomalies

1. **Systemic Delays**: Manual data entry processes might cause significant delays between activities like approval and notification, leading to large time gaps.
2. **Automated Steps**: Certain automated steps might be happening too quickly, possibly bypassing necessary checks or validations, resulting in anomalies such as extremely short times between evaluate and notify.
3. **Bottlenecks**: There might be bottlenecks at specific stages of the process, such as approval, causing extended waiting times before notifications are sent out.
4. **Resource Availability**: Inconsistent availability of adjusters or other resources could lead to irregular timing patterns, particularly affecting the assign to close and approve to notify intervals.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

#### Query 1: Identify Claims with Unusual R to P Time
```sql
WITH r_to_p_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM 
        claim_events ce1
    JOIN 
        claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE 
        ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    r_to_p_times
WHERE 
    time_diff_seconds < 86400 OR time_diff_seconds > 93600; -- Outside expected range [24h Â± 4h]
```

#### Query 2: Correlate Adjusters with Long P to N Times
```sql
WITH p_to_n_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.resource AS adjuster,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM 
        claim_events ce1
    JOIN 
        claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE 
        ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    adjuster,
    AVG(time_diff_seconds) AS avg_time,
    STDDEV(time_diff_seconds) AS stddev_time
FROM 
    p_to_n_times
GROUP BY 
    adjuster
HAVING 
    AVG(time_diff_seconds) > 604800 OR STDDEV(time_diff_seconds) > 172800; -- Check for extreme averages and deviations
```

#### Query 3: Identify Prematurely Closed Claims
```sql
WITH a_to_c_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.resource AS adjuster,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM 
        claim_events ce1
    JOIN 
        claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE 
        ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    adjuster,
    time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    a_to_c_times
WHERE 
    time_diff_seconds < 3600; -- Less than 1 hour suggests premature closure
```

#### Query 4: Filter Claims with Extremely Quick E to N Transitions
```sql
WITH e_to_n_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM 
        claim_events ce1
    JOIN 
        claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE 
        ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    e_to_n_times
WHERE 
    time_diff_seconds < 240; -- Less than 4 minutes indicates suspiciously quick transitions
```

These queries help identify specific claims and conditions contributing to the observed anomalies, allowing for further investigation into potential causes and corrective actions.
