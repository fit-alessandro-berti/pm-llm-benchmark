Based on the provided directly follows graph and the associated frequencies and durations, several process and data-specific considerations can be identified as potential root causes for performance issues:

### Object Type: Handling Unit
1. **"Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck"**:
   - **High Duration (7820.93)**: This duration is significantly high compared to other activities. This could indicate inefficiencies in the collection process or delays in loading the truck.

### Object Type: Truck
2. **"Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck"**:
   - **High Duration (84119.09)**: This duration is exceptionally high, suggesting potential delays or inefficiencies in the process of driving to the terminal and then loading the truck again.

### Object Type: Container
3. **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container"**:
   - **High Duration (368943.92)**: This duration is very high, indicating significant delays in ordering and picking up empty containers.
4. **"Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay"**:
   - **High Duration (743380.51)**: This duration is extremely high, suggesting inefficiencies or delays in moving containers from stock to the loading bay.
5. **"Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle"**:
   - **High Duration (177997.60)**: This duration indicates significant delays in rescheduling containers and then loading them onto the vehicle.

### Object Type: Vehicle
6. **"Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles"**:
   - **High Duration (295965.56)**: This duration is very high, indicating inefficiencies or delays in the booking process itself.
7. **"Book Vehicles" -> "Reschedule Container"**:
   - **High Duration (371476.42)**: This duration is exceptionally high, suggesting significant delays in rescheduling containers after booking vehicles.

### Object Type: Forklift
8. **"Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay"**:
   - **High Duration (112600.53)**: This duration is very high, indicating inefficiencies or delays in moving items from stock to the loading bay.
9. **"Weigh" -> "Weigh"**:
   - **High Duration (219774.00)**: This duration is exceptionally high, suggesting potential delays or inefficiencies in the weighing process.

### Object Type: Customer Order
10. **"Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document"**:
    - **High Duration (329005.22)**: This duration is very high, indicating significant delays in creating transport documents after registering customer orders.

### Object Type: Transport Document
11. **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart"**:
    - **High Duration (1007066.16)**: This duration is extremely high, suggesting significant delays in ordering empty containers and departing.
12. **"Depart" -> "Depart"**:
    - **High Duration (1051301.41)**: This duration is exceptionally high, indicating potential delays or inefficiencies in the departure process.

### Summary of Root Causes
- **High Durations**: Many activities have exceptionally high durations, indicating potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the process.
- **Repetitive Activities**: Some activities are repeated multiple times with high durations, suggesting possible rework or inefficiencies.
- **Process Complexity**: The presence of multiple activities with high durations across different object types indicates a complex process with several potential points of delay.

### Recommendations
1. **Analyze Bottlenecks**: Investigate the high-duration activities to identify specific bottlenecks.
2. **Optimize Scheduling**: Look into optimizing the scheduling of activities, especially those involving "Reschedule Container" and "Book Vehicles".
3. **Process Simplification**: Simplify complex processes where possible to reduce delays and inefficiencies.
4. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate resource allocation to activities with high frequencies and durations to improve throughput.

Addressing these specific issues can help in improving the overall performance of the process.
