Based on the provided directly follows graph and the associated data, here are some potential root causes for performance issues in the process, focusing on process and data-specific considerations:

1. **Long Duration Activities:**
   - **"Drive to Terminal"** for Trucks: This activity has a very high duration (84119.09) and is performed frequently (1988 times). This could indicate inefficiencies in driving routes or delays at the terminal.
   - **"Order Empty Containers"** and **"Pick Up Empty Container"** for Containers: These activities have extremely high durations (368943.92 and 38659.62, respectively), suggesting potential delays in ordering or picking up empty containers.
   - **"Book Vehicles"** for Vehicles: This activity has a very high duration (295965.56) and is performed frequently (585 times), which could indicate inefficiencies in the vehicle booking process.

2. **High Frequency of Certain Activities:**
   - **"Load Truck"** for Trucks and Containers: This activity is performed a high number of times (8559 times for both Trucks and Containers), which could indicate inefficiencies in the loading process or a high volume of goods to be loaded.
   - **"Place in Stock"** for Containers: This activity is performed a high number of times (1814 times) and has a relatively high duration (1960.09), suggesting potential delays in the stocking process.

3. **Recurrent Activities:**
   - **"Load Truck"** -> **"Load Truck"** for Trucks and Containers: This pattern suggests that trucks and containers are being loaded multiple times, which could indicate inefficiencies in the loading process or a need for better planning.
   - **"Book Vehicles"** -> **"Book Vehicles"** for Vehicles: This pattern suggests that vehicles are being booked multiple times, which could indicate inefficiencies in the vehicle booking process or a need for better planning.
   - **"Reschedule Container"** for Vehicles and Containers: This pattern suggests that containers are being rescheduled frequently, which could indicate issues with initial scheduling or unexpected events causing rescheduling.

4. **Imbalanced Object Frequencies:**
   - For some activities, the number of objects (frequency of objects) is much lower than the number of events (frequency of events), which could indicate that some objects take significantly longer than others to complete the activity. For example, "Load Truck" for Trucks has 8559 events but only 6 objects, with a duration of 5259.71.

To address these performance issues, you could consider the following process improvements:

- Investigate and optimize the driving routes and terminal processes to reduce the duration of "Drive to Terminal".
- Improve the efficiency of the container ordering and picking up processes to reduce the duration of "Order Empty Containers" and "Pick Up Empty Container".
- Review the vehicle booking process to identify and address inefficiencies.
- Evaluate the loading process to identify and address potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
- Improve the scheduling process to reduce the frequency of rescheduling.
- Investigate the reasons behind the imbalanced object frequencies and address any underlying issues.
