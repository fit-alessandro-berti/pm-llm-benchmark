To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze the process variants and their execution times. Here are some key differences observed:

1. **Frequency of Rejection**:
   - **Protected Group**: The frequency of rejection processes is relatively high, especially in the initial stages. For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 484)
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 1036)
   - **Unprotected Group**: The frequency of rejection processes is also high but seems to be more distributed across different stages. For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 365)
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 674)

2. **Execution Time for Rejection Processes**:
   - **Protected Group**: The execution time for rejection processes is generally higher. For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant (performance = 89999.306)
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant (performance = 270000.477)
   - **Unprotected Group**: The execution time for rejection processes is generally lower. For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant (performance = 80002.688)
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant (performance = 240000.654)

3. **Extensive Screening**:
   - **Protected Group**: There are more instances of extensive screening leading to rejection. For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 793, performance = 540011.977)
   - **Unprotected Group**: There are fewer instances of extensive screening leading to rejection. For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 1022, performance = 480013.530)

4. **Successful Tenancy**:
   - **Protected Group**: There are fewer instances of successful tenancy (moving in and paying rent multiple times). For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment (frequency = 29, performance = 810021.897)
   - **Unprotected Group**: There are more instances of successful tenancy. For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment (frequency = 268, performance = 640003.769)

5. **Tenant Cancellation**:
   - **Protected Group**: Tenant cancellations are more frequent and occur after fewer rent payments. For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment (frequency = 29, performance = 810021.897)
   - **Unprotected Group**: Tenant cancellations are less frequent and occur after more rent payments. For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment (frequency = 128, performance = 880029.711)

6. **Eviction**:
   - **Protected Group**: There are instances of eviction due to missed rent payments. For example:
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant (frequency = 6, performance = 990084.833)
   - **Unprotected Group**: There are no instances of eviction reported.

### Conclusion:
The main differences observed are:
- Higher rejection rates and longer execution times for rejection processes in the protected group.
- More instances of extensive screening leading to rejection in the protected group.
- Fewer successful tenancies and more frequent tenant cancellations in the protected group.
- Instances of eviction due to missed rent payments in the protected group.

These differences suggest that the protected group may be subject to more stringent screening and higher rejection rates, leading to fewer successful tenancies and more frequent cancellations. The unprotected group seems to have a smoother process with fewer rejections and more successful tenancies.
