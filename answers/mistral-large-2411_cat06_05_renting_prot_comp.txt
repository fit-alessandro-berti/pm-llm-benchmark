To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze the process variants and their performance metrics. Here are the main differences observed:

1. **Frequency of Rejection**:
   - **Protected Group**: The frequency of rejection after viewing the property is relatively high (1036 instances).
   - **Unprotected Group**: The frequency of rejection after viewing the property is also high (2490 instances).

2. **Extensive Screening**:
   - **Protected Group**: There are multiple instances where the prospective tenant undergoes extensive screening before being rejected (793 instances) or before signing a contract (various instances).
   - **Unprotected Group**: There are also instances of extensive screening, but the frequency is lower (1022 instances for rejection and various instances for signing a contract).

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Protected Group**: The performance metrics (execution time) for the processes involving extensive screening and rejection are generally higher. For example, the performance for the process involving extensive screening and rejection is 540011.977, which is significantly higher than the unprotected group's 480013.530.
   - **Unprotected Group**: The performance metrics for similar processes are generally lower. For example, the performance for the process involving extensive screening and rejection is 480013.530, which is lower than the protected group's 540011.977.

4. **Tenant Cancellation**:
   - **Protected Group**: There are instances where tenants cancel the apartment after paying rent multiple times. The performance metrics for these processes are high, indicating longer execution times.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Similar instances of tenant cancellation exist, but the performance metrics are generally lower, indicating shorter execution times.

5. **Eviction Process**:
   - **Protected Group**: There is an instance where the tenant misses a rent payment, receives a warning, and is eventually evicted. The performance metric for this process is 990084.833.
   - **Unprotected Group**: There is no reported instance of eviction in the provided data.

6. **Overall Process Duration**:
   - **Protected Group**: The overall process durations, especially for processes involving extensive screening and multiple rent payments, are generally longer.
   - **Unprotected Group**: The overall process durations are generally shorter, even for processes involving extensive screening and multiple rent payments.

### Key Observations:
- **Discrimination in Screening**: The protected group seems to undergo more extensive screening processes, which take longer and may indicate stricter criteria or additional hurdles.
- **Rejection Rates**: The rejection rates after viewing the property are higher for the unprotected group, suggesting a potential bias in the initial screening process.
- **Tenant Retention**: The protected group has longer durations for processes involving multiple rent payments and eventual cancellation, which could indicate difficulties in retaining tenants or longer lease periods.
- **Eviction**: The presence of an eviction process in the protected group and its absence in the unprotected group suggests a potential disparity in how tenants are managed post-occupancy.

### Conclusion:
The main differences lie in the frequency and duration of screening processes, rejection rates, overall process durations, and the presence of eviction processes. These differences suggest potential unfair treatment, with the protected group facing stricter screening, longer process durations, and more complex post-occupancy management.
