Below is one way to approach the task:


1. Anomalies in the POWL Model

• Loop Structure (Evaluation and Approval):  
  – The model specifies a loop between the evaluation (E) and approval (P) steps. Instead of a single evaluation followed by a single approval, this loop suggests that evaluation can be repeatedly performed and followed by approval, or even re-evaluation immediately after an approval. This is atypical since normally we expect a claim to be evaluated once (or in a clearly bounded set of evaluations) before proceeding to approval.

• XOR that May Skip Customer Notification:  
  – An exclusive choice is made between notifying the customer (N) or taking a silent transition (skip). This means that some claims might not trigger a notification step at all. In a properly designed claim process, one would expect that the customer must be notified of the claim’s outcome.

• Partial Orders Allowing Premature Closure:  
  – The ordering between activities is partially defined. For example, the ordering allows the Close Claim (C) to occur after Assign Adjuster (A) rather than strictly waiting for the evaluation/approval loop and even the notification. This could result in claims being closed prematurely—i.e., before they have been evaluated and approved properly.


2. Hypotheses on Why Anomalies Might Exist

• Evolving Business Rules:  
  – It could be that the business was attempting to implement a dynamic review process where claims could be re-evaluated if new information became available. However, the loop might not be fully controlled or constrained by clear exit conditions, leading to repeated cycles.

• Incomplete Process Integration:  
  – There might have been miscommunications or partial rollouts, wherein one department updated its rules (for instance, concerning immediate closure under certain conditions) but other parts of the process (such as mandatory notifications) were not yet fully integrated.

• Technical Limitations or Errors:  
  – The process modeling tool might have technical limitations, leading to unexpected sequencing. For instance, if the tool does not strictly enforce the intended sequencing, the intentional addition of an edge from A to C might have been put in place as a workaround, inadvertently enabling premature closure.

• Flexible Process Execution:  
  – In some cases, operational realities (such as high-volume claims or time-sensitive cancellations) might have forced temporary shortcuts in the process—allowing claims to close even when some steps (like customer notification) were not completed.


3. Proposals for Verifying Hypotheses Using the Database

To check if these anomalies are manifesting in practice, one can design queries over the event log table (claim_events) and related tables:

A. Identify Claims Closed Without Proper Evaluation or Approval:

  • Query for each claim where the Close Claim (C) event occurred, but there is no corresponding evaluation (E) or approval (P) event recorded before the closure.
  
  Example SQL:
  ----------------------------------------------------
  SELECT c.claim_id,
         MIN(ce.timestamp) AS first_close_time
  FROM claims c
  JOIN claim_events ce
    ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
  WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
         SELECT 1
         FROM claim_events ce2
         WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id
           AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P')
           AND ce2.timestamp < ce.timestamp
         )
  GROUP BY c.claim_id;
  ----------------------------------------------------
  This query helps verify if any claims are closed without having undergone an evaluation or approval.

B. Locate Claims with Multiple Approvals:

  • Identify claims that record multiple instances of the Approval (P) event (possibly due to the looping structure).
  
  Example SQL:
  ----------------------------------------------------
  SELECT claim_id,
         COUNT(*) as approval_count
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'P'
  GROUP BY claim_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  ----------------------------------------------------
  This indicates whether the loop structure is generating repeated approvals.

C. Check if Customer Notification Steps Are Frequently Skipped:

  • Identify claims for which, after an approval event, there is no subsequent Notify Customer (N) event before closure.
  
  Example SQL:
  ----------------------------------------------------
  SELECT c.claim_id
  FROM claims c
  JOIN claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id
  WHERE ce_close.activity = 'C'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
         SELECT 1
         FROM claim_events ce_n
         WHERE ce_n.claim_id = c.claim_id
           AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
           AND ce_n.timestamp < ce_close.timestamp
         );
  ----------------------------------------------------
  This query helps determine how often claims are closed without a customer notification, which may indicate that the XOR branch favoring the silent transition is being used.

D. Investigate Out-of-Sequence Occurrence of Activities:

  • To further inspect the ordering, one could write a query that verifies the timestamps of the key events (R, A, E, P, N, C) for each claim. Any instance where C appears before N (or before E/P) would suggest possible out-of-sequence execution.
  
  Example SQL:
  ----------------------------------------------------
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS r_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS a_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS e_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS n_time,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS c_time
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
  HAVING (c_time < e_time OR c_time < p_time OR (n_time IS NULL));
  ----------------------------------------------------
  In this query, claims where the Close Claim (C) event happens before evaluation (E) or approval (P) or where notification (N) is missing can be flagged for further analysis.


Conclusion

By identifying these unusual structures in the POWL model and using the queries above, one can verify whether the recorded claim events in the underlying PostgreSQL tables reflect these anomalies in practice. This information can then be used to pinpoint whether the anomalies are due to changing business requirements, workflow integration issues, or technical errors, and inform the necessary process or system updates.
