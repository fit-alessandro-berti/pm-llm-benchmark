Process enhancement in process mining refers to the process of improving a business process by identifying inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. This is done by analyzing process data and identifying patterns and trends that can be used to make recommendations for process improvement. The goal of process enhancement is to optimize process efficiency, reduce costs, and improve quality.

Process discovery, on the other hand, is the process of discovering the actual process that is being executed in the organization. This is done by analyzing event logs and other process data to identify the sequence of activities that are being performed. The goal of process discovery is to understand the current state of the process and identify areas for improvement.

Conformance checking, on the other hand, is the process of checking how well the actual process being executed conforms to a reference process. This is done by comparing the actual process data to a reference process model and identifying any deviations or discrepancies. The goal of conformance checking is to ensure that the process is being executed in the way that was intended and to identify any areas where the actual process deviates from the reference process.

In summary, process enhancement in process mining is focused on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of a process, process discovery is focused on understanding the current state of the process, and conformance checking is focused on ensuring that the process is being executed as intended.
