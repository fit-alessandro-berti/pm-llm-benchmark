Based on the provided event log, I've analyzed the numerical patterns in the sensor readings to infer distinct phases in the manufacturing process. Here's how I've grouped the events and assigned meaningful labels:

### Group 1: Initial Idle/Calibration Phase (Events #1-3, #13-15)
- **Label**: "Standby/Calibration"
- **Events**: 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15
- **Pattern**:
  - Very low temperature (20-21°C) and pressure (1 bar).
  - No vibration (0 Hz), no material flow (0 units/s), tool in initial position (0 mm).
  - Low energy consumption (0.40-0.50 kWh).
- **Rationale**: Consistent baseline readings suggest the machine is in a standby or idle state, possibly during calibration or inspection. The tool is not active, and no material is being processed.

### Group 2: Material Feed Setup (Events #11-12)
- **Label**: "Material Preparation"
- **Events**: 11, 12
- **Pattern**:
  - Slight temperature drop (25°C), very low pressure (1 bar).
  - Very minimal vibration (5 Hz).
  - Low material flow (1 unit/s), tool moving (20 mm).
  - Low energy consumption (1.50-1.60 kWh).
- **Rationale**: Subtle changes in tool position and minor flow initiation suggest preparing for active operation, possibly aligning or guiding materials.

### Group 3: Cutting/Heating Operation (Events #4-6)
- **Label**: "Cutting Metal"
- **Events**: 4, 5, 6
- **Pattern**:
  - Significant temperature increase (50-58°C), slight pressure increase (1-1.5 bar).
  - Increased vibration (30-38 Hz), steady material flow (5 units/s).
  - Tool moving forward (5-10 mm), high energy consumption (2.00-3.00 kWh).
- **Rationale**: Elevated temperature, vibration, and energy usage indicate a heat-intensive operation like cutting metal. The tool's movement and material flow align with active cutting or shaping.

### Group 4: Positioning/Alignment (Events #7-8)
- **Label**: "Component Alignment"
- **Events**: 7, 8
- **Pattern**:
  - Temperature drop (40°C), moderate pressure (2 bar).
  - Low vibration (10 Hz), reduced material flow (2 units/s).
  - Tool in fixed position (15 mm), moderate energy usage (2.00 kWh).
- **Rationale**: Stable conditions with reduced material flow suggest precise positioning or aligning components rather than active processing.

### Group 5: Welding/Fusing (Events #9)
- **Label**: "Welding"
- **Event**: 9
- **Pattern**:
  - Very high temperature (80°C), moderate pressure (2 bar).
  - High vibration (50 Hz), zero material flow.
  - Tool steady (15 mm), highest energy consumption (5.00 kWh).
- **Rationale**: Extreme temperature and energy, with no material flow, imply a welding or fusing phase where components are joined under intense heat.

### Group 6: Cleanup/Transition (Events #10)
- **Label**: "Cooling Down"
- **Event**: 10
- **Pattern**:
  - Moderate temperature (30°C), very low pressure (1 bar).
  - Minimal vibration (1 Hz), no material flow.
  - Tool in final position (15 mm), low energy usage (1.00 kWh).
- **Rationale**: Temperature reduction and stabilizing values indicate the machine is cooling down or transitioning to idle status after an intense operation.

### Summary of Labeled Activities:
1. **Standby/Calibration**: Low activity, standby state.
2. **Material Preparation**: Minor tool and flow adjustments.
3. **Cutting Metal**: High vibration, temperature, and energy during cutting.
4. **Component Alignment**: Precise positioning with controlled conditions.
5. **Welding**: Extreme heat and energy for fusing components.
6. **Cooling Down**: Transition to idle after a high-intensity operation.

This grouping reflects a typical manufacturing workflow: preparation, processing (cutting/welding), alignment, and reset. The labels align with observable patterns in the data, demonstrating how process mining can infer meaningful activities from sensor readings.
