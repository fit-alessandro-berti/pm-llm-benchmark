Based solely on the provided data, the significant performance bottlenecks appear to be:

1. **`Order Empty Containers` -> `Pick Up Empty Container` (Container):** This transition has an exceptionally high duration (368943.92). This suggests a major problem in the container acquisition process.  The sheer duration points to a significant delay that needs investigation.

2. **`Place in Stock` -> `Bring to Loading Bay` (Container):**  Another extremely long duration (743380.51) indicates a substantial delay in moving containers from stock to the loading bay. This warrants further examination of the storage and retrieval mechanisms.

3. **`Book Vehicles` -> `Book Vehicles` (Vehicle):** The high duration (295965.56) for this self-loop suggests inefficiencies or lengthy delays within the vehicle booking process itself. This needs detailed analysis.  The large difference in event and object frequency also warrants attention.

4. **`Depart` -> `Depart` (Transport Document):**  A very long duration (1051301.41) for a self-loop indicates significant delays after the initial departure, likely related to unforeseen circumstances or further processing steps.  The discrepancy between event and object frequency needs investigation.


5. **`Order Empty Containers` -> `Depart` (Transport Document):** A very long duration (1007066.16) indicates a significant delay between ordering empty containers and the final departure.  This points to a system-wide problem involving container procurement and overall process flow.

The duration values for these transitions are significantly larger than others, making them prime candidates for root cause analysis.  The discrepancies between the number of events and objects in some transitions (e.g., `Book Vehicles` -> `Book Vehicles` in Vehicle) also suggest further investigation is needed into data integrity.
