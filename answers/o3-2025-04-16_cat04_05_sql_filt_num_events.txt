```sql
-- Return only the events that belong to cases with  6 events
SELECT  e.*
FROM    event_log AS e
JOIN   (
        SELECT  case_id
        FROM    event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
        HAVING  COUNT(*) <= 6        -- keep cases with 6 or fewer events
       ) AS ok_cases
USING  (case_id);
```

Explanation:

1. The sub-query (`ok_cases`) counts how many events each `case_id` has and keeps only those whose count is  6.  
2. The outer query joins the original `event_log` with this filtered list, returning every event for the qualifying cases—thereby excluding all events from cases that have more than six events.
