Here is one concise way to do it in DuckDB:

```sql
-- 1) Work out how many events each case_id has
-- 2) Keep only the case_ids whose total  6
-- 3) Return all events that belong to those case_ids

WITH cases_with_6_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6          -- keep only “small” cases
)

SELECT  e.*                       -- every event of the retained cases
FROM    event_log AS e
JOIN    cases_with_6_events AS c
USING   (case_id)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;      -- optional, but usually helpful
```

Explanation:

1. The CTE (`cases_with_6_events`) groups the log by `case_id` and keeps only those groups whose size is six or fewer (`HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`).
2. The main query joins the original `event_log` with that CTE, so only events whose `case_id` appears in the filtered list are returned.
3. `ORDER BY` is optional but often desirable to get the events in chronological order within each case.
