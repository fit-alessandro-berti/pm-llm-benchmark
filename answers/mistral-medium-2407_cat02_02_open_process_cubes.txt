Process cubes play a vital role in multi-dimensional process mining by providing an extended view of business processes, enabling analysts to explore and analyze processes from multiple perspectives. Traditional process mining approaches primarily focus on discovering, analyzing, and enhancing process models based on event logs, while multi-dimensional process mining with process cubes offers additional insights by incorporating contextual information.

Key differences between traditional process mining and multi-dimensional process mining using process cubes include:

1. Contextual data integration: In traditional process mining, event logs contain limited information about the process instances, usually just the activities, timestamps, and case identifiers. Process cubes, on the other hand, integrate contextual data from various sources, such as organizational structures, resources, and performance indicators. This integration allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the process behavior.

2. Multi-dimensional analysis: Traditional process mining focuses on analyzing the control-flow perspective of the process, i.e., the sequence of activities. Multi-dimensional process mining using process cubes enables analysts to explore the process from different angles, such as time, resources, and organizational units, by providing pre-aggregated views of the data. This multi-dimensional analysis helps identify patterns, trends, and correlations that might not be apparent in traditional process mining.

3. Performance measurement and monitoring: Process cubes can incorporate performance indicators, such as process cycle times, costs, and throughput, which are essential for monitoring and optimizing business processes. Traditional process mining may provide some performance metrics, but process cubes offer a more structured and extensive view of performance data, making it easier to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement.

4. Advanced visualization and reporting: Process cubes often come with advanced visualization and reporting capabilities, allowing users to interactively explore the data and create custom views, dashboards, and reports. Traditional process mining tools typically provide limited visualization options, focusing mainly on process models and basic performance metrics.

5. Enhanced process discovery and conformance checking: By incorporating contextual data, process cubes can improve the accuracy and completeness of process discovery and conformance checking. For example, they can help identify variants of a process that are specific to certain organizational units, resources, or time periods, which might be overlooked in traditional process mining approaches.

In summary, while traditional process mining focuses on discovering and analyzing process models based on event logs, multi-dimensional process mining using process cubes provides a more comprehensive view of business processes by integrating contextual data and enabling multi-dimensional analysis, performance measurement, and advanced visualization. This extended view helps organizations gain deeper insights into their processes and make more informed decisions about process improvement initiatives.
