**Explanation:**

- **Main Sequence Path**: `Receive Application  Validate Form  Assess Eligibility  Request Missing Info (loop)  Approval Decision  Send Confirmation  Archive Case`
  - This captures the typical flow of receiving an application, validating it, assessing eligibility, handling missing information requests, leading to approval, confirmation, and finally archival.

- **Optional Loop**: `REQUEST MISSING INFO` can occur multiple times before reaching `APPROVAL DECISION`. This is modeled as a loop using the `* (A, B)` operator where `RMI` is repeated until an explicit end condition (approval) or final archival step is reached.
  
- **Parallel Activities**: The parallel nature of activities like receiving applications and starting validations are represented by the initial `PARALLEL` node, indicating that multiple processes can be happening simultaneously.

This structure balances complexity in capturing loops for missing information requests while maintaining simplicity in representing the overall process flow.
