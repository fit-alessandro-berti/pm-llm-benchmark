# Business Process Flow Visualization

This is a **process mining diagram** that visualizes multiple interconnected business workflows, likely from an ERP or enterprise system. Here's what it shows:

## Main Process Flows

### 1. **Purchase Requisition Flow** (Purple/Teal - Left side)
- Starts with **PurchaseRequisitionItem** (2.0M objects)
- Progresses through: Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  Send Order  End
- Processing volumes: 3.0M  5.7M  5.2M objects

### 2. **Sales Order Flow** (Orange - Right side)
- Originates from **SalesOrderItem** (3.5M) and **PurchaseOrderItem** (5.0M)
- Main sequence: Create Order (8.5M)  Pack Goods (2.0M)  Ship Goods (1.8M)  Confirm Delivery (1.7M)  Close Order (1.7M)  End

### 3. **Supporting Processes** (Center)
- **Check Stock** (1.0M overall)
- **Approve Payment** (1.5M overall)
- **Process Return** (0.8M overall) - linked to ReturnOrderItem
- **Create Invoice** (2.0M overall)

## Key Features

- **Timing information**: Edge labels show process durations in milliseconds (e.g., 300ms, 450ms)
- **Volume metrics**: Each activity shows "Overall" counts indicating how many instances passed through
- **Multiple variants**: Colored dots represent different process execution paths
- **Complex interconnections**: Multiple feedback loops and cross-process dependencies
- **Multiple endpoints**: Different process paths terminate at various "End" nodes

This appears to be analyzing order-to-cash and procure-to-pay processes with their interconnections.
