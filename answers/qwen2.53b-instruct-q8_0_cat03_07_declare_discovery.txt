Certainly! To create a declarative model of the process described, I'll use a structure that represents states and transitions between these states in a clear manner. This can be achieved through an event-driven process chain (EPK) or State Machine representation.

Here is how we could declare such a model:

```plaintext
DECLARE MODEL ProcessModel {

  STATE Create_Fine {
    EVENT Send_Fine { 
      TRANSITION Insert_Fine_Notification { } // Transition to Insert Fine Notification state
      EVENT Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture {
        TRANSITION Add_penalty { }
        TRANSITION Insert_Appeal_Judge { }
      }
    }

    EVENT Payment {
      TRANSITION Notify_Result_Appeal_Offender { }
      TRANSITION Send_For_Credit_Collection { }
    }

    // Other event transitions leading to this state

  }

  STATE Insert_Fine_Notification {
    EVENT Add_Penalty {
      TRANSITION Appeal_to_Judge { }
      TRANSITION Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture { }
    }
    EVENT Payment { 
      TRANSITION Send_For_Credit_Collection { } // Transition to Send For Credit Collection state
    }

    // Other event transitions leading to this state

  }

  STATE Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture {
    EVENT Add_Penalty {
      TRANSITION Receive_Result_Appeal_from_Prefecture { }
      TRANSITION Notify_Result_Appeal_Offender { }
    }
    EVENT Appeal_to_Judge { 
      TRANSITION Send_Fine_Notification { }
      TRANSITION Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture { } // Loop state if not resolved
    }

    // Other event transitions leading to this state

  }

  STATE Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture {
    EVENT Appeal_to_Judge { 
      TRANSITION Notify_Result_Appeal_Offender { }
      TRANSITION Receive_Result_Appeal_from_Prefecture { } // Transition to Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture
    }
    EVENT Payment { 
      TRANSITION Send_Fine_Notification { }
      TRANSITION Add_Penalty { }
      TRANSITION Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture { }
    }

    // Other event transitions leading to this state

  }

  STATE Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture {
    EVENT Appeal_to_Judge { 
      TRANSITION Send_Fine_Notification { }
      TRANSITION Receive_Result_Appeal_from_Prefecture { } // Transition to Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture
    }
    EVENT Payment {
      TRANSITION Notify_Result_Appeal_Offender { }
      TRANSITION Add_Penalty { }
      TRANSITION Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture { }
    }

    // Other event transitions leading to this state

  }

  STATE Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture {
    EVENT Appeal_to_Judge {
      TRANSITION Send_Fine_Notification { }
      TRANSITION Receive_Result_Appeal_from_Prefecture { } // Transition to Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture
    }
    EVENT Payment {
      TRANSITION Notify_Result_Appeal_Offender { }
      TRANSITION Add_Penalty { }
      TRANSITION Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture { }
    }

    // Other event transitions leading to this state

  }

  STATE Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture {
    EVENT Appeal_to_Judge { 
      TRANSITION Send_Fine_Notification { }
      TRANSITION Receive_Result_Appeal_from_Prefecture { } // Transition to Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture
    }
    EVENT Payment { 
      TRANSITION Notify_Result_Appeal_Offender { }
      TRANSITION Add_Penalty { }
      TRANSITION Insert_Date_Appeal_to_Prefecture { }
    }

    // Other event transitions leading to this state

  }

}
```

### Explanation of the Model:

1. **States**: We have several states, such as `Create_Fine`, `Insert_Fine_Notification`, and others.
2. **Events**: These are triggers that lead into the next state or perform actions like adding penalties or making payments.
3. **Transitions**: Each event can trigger specific transitions between states or within the same state based on defined conditions.

This model helps visualize all possible paths a process can take from creation of a fine to its resolution, with each step and its corresponding outcomes clearly represented.

### Additional Considerations:
- The number and frequency of events are included for each state.
- Transitions might need more details or conditional logic depending on the specific business rules governing the system (e.g., conditions under which certain events can trigger certain actions).
  
This should provide a foundational framework to further develop your process model.
