To solve for the case groupings from the given events, we need to identify which events belong to the same "case" based on a combination of attributes such as `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, and the logical sequence of events such as "Register patient" typically being the first event in a case and "Patient discharged" typically being one of the last.

The key attributes we need to consistently keep track of are:
- `patient_age`
- `patient_gender`
- `department` (which might change throughout a case, but initial department often indicates where the case started).

Let us analyze the events one by one:

1. **Event 1:**
   - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z`, `activity: Register patient`, `resource: Admin Clerk`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 45`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: insurance=private`
   - This event is the first "Register patient" event so it starts a new case. Case 1 can be defined by `patient_age: 45` and `patient_gender: M`.

2. **Event 2:**
   - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z`, `activity: Register patient`, `resource: Admin Clerk`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F`, `additional_info: insurance=public`
   - This is another "Register patient" event with a different `patient_age` and `patient_gender`, so it should be the start of a second case. Case 2 can be defined by `patient_age: 62` and `patient_gender: F`.

3. **Event 3:**
   - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z`, `activity: Register patient`, `resource: Admin Clerk`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: insurance=private`
   - Another "Register patient" event but with yet another `patient_age` and `patient_gender`, so it should be the start of a third case. Case 3 can be defined by `patient_age: 28` and `patient_gender: M`.

4. **Event 4:**
   - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z`, `activity: Initial triage`, `resource: Nurse Joy`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 45`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: triage_code=3`
   - This event has `patient_age: 45` and `patient_gender: M`, matching Event 1. Thus, it should belong to Case 1.

5. **Event 5:**
   - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z`, `activity: Initial triage`, `resource: Nurse Mark`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F`, `additional_info: triage_code=2`
   - This event has `patient_age: 62` and `patient_gender: F`, matching Event 2. Thus, it should belong to Case 2.

6. **Event 6:**
   - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z`, `activity: Doctor consultation`, `resource: Dr. Lee`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery`
   - This event has `patient_age: 28` and `patient_gender: M`, matching Event 3. Thus, it should belong to Case 3.

7. **Event 7:**
   - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z`, `activity: X-ray imaging`, `resource: Radiology Tech`, `department: Radiology`, `patient_age: 45`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: body_part=left_leg`
   - This event has `patient_age: 45` and `patient_gender: M`, matching Event 1 and Event 4. Thus, it should belong to Case 1.

8. **Event 8:**
   - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z`, `activity: Lab test requested`, `resource: Dr. Smith`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F`, `additional_info: test_type=blood_panel`
   - This event has `patient_age: 62` and `patient_gender: F`, matching Event 2 and Event 5. Thus, it should belong to Case 2.

9. **Event 9:**
   - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z`, `activity: Surgery preparation`, `resource: Surgical Nurse`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: prep_type=general_anesthesia`
   - This event has `patient_age: 28` and `patient_gender: M`, matching Event 3 and Event 6. Thus, it should belong to Case 3.

10. **Event 10:**
    - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z`, `activity: Lab test completed`, `resource: Lab Technician`, `department: Laboratory`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F`, `additional_info: results=normal_levels`
    - This event has `patient_age: 62` and `patient_gender: F`, matching Event 2, Event 5, and Event 8. Thus, it should belong to Case 2.

11. **Event 11:**
    - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z`, `activity: Doctor consultation`, `resource: Dr. Smith`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F`, `additional_info: diagnosis=minor_infection`
    - This event has `patient_age: 62` and `patient_gender: F`, matching Event 2, Event 5, Event 8, and Event 10. Thus, it should belong to Case 2.

12. **Event 12:**
    - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z`, `activity: Doctor consultation`, `resource: Dr. Lee`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 45`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture`
    - This event has `patient_age: 45` and `patient_gender: M`, matching Event 1, Event 4, and Event 7. Thus, it should belong to Case 1.

13. **Event 13:**
    - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z`, `activity: Surgery performed`, `resource: Dr. Lee`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: procedure=arthroscopy`
    - This event has `patient_age: 28` and `patient_gender: M`, matching Event 3, Event 6, and Event 9. Thus, it should belong to Case 3.

14. **Event 14:**
    - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z`, `activity: Prescription created`, `resource: Dr. Smith`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F`, `additional_info: medication=antibiotics`
    - This event has `patient_age: 62` and `patient_gender: F`, matching Event 2, Event 5, Event 8, Event 10, and Event 11. Thus, it should belong to Case 2.

15. **Event 15:**
    - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z`, `activity: Patient discharged`, `resource: Ward Clerk`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 45`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: followup=outpatient_clinic`
    - This event has `patient_age: 45` and `patient_gender: M`, matching Event 1, Event 4, Event 7, and Event 12. Thus, it should belong to Case 1.

16. **Event 16:**
    - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z`, `activity: Recovery room`, `resource: Recovery Nurse`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: condition=stable`
    - This event has `patient_age: 28` and `patient_gender: M`, matching Event 3, Event 6, Event 9, and Event 13. Thus, it should belong to Case 3.

17. **Event 17:**
    - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z`, `activity: Patient discharged`, `resource: Ward Clerk`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F`, `additional_info: followup=pharmacy_pickup`
    - This event has `patient_age: 62` and `patient_gender: F`, matching Event 2, Event 5, Event 8, Event 10, Event 11, and Event 14. Thus, it should belong to Case 2.

18. **Event 18:**
    - `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z`, `activity: Patient discharged`, `resource: Ward Clerk`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M`, `additional_info: followup=physiotherapy_sessions`
    - This event has `patient_age: 28` and `patient_gender: M`, matching Event 3, Event 6, Event 9, Event 13, and Event 16. Thus, it should belong to Case 3.

Based on the reasoning above, here is the grouping of events for each case based on the unique combinations of `patient_age` and `patient_gender`:

### Case 1 (patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, started in ER department):
1. Event 1 (Register patient, 08:05:13, ER)
2. Event 4 (Initial triage, 08:10:50, ER)
3. Event 7 (X-ray imaging, 08:15:42, Radiology)
4. Event 12 (Doctor consultation, 08:23:10, ER)
5. Event 15 (Patient discharged, 08:30:05, ER)

### Case 2 (patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, started in ER department):
1. Event 2 (Register patient, 08:07:02, ER)
2. Event 5 (Initial triage, 08:12:29, ER)
3. Event 8 (Lab test requested, 08:16:10, ER)
4. Event 10 (Lab test completed, 08:20:27, Laboratory)
5. Event 11 (Doctor consultation, 08:22:54, ER)
6. Event 14 (Prescription created, 08:27:00, ER)
7. Event 17 (Patient discharged, 08:35:29, ER)

### Case 3 (patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, started in Surgery department):
1. Event 3 (Register patient, 08:07:15, Surgery)
2. Event 6 (Doctor consultation, 08:13:00, Surgery)
3. Event 9 (Surgery preparation, 08:16:45, Surgery)
4. Event 13 (Surgery performed, 08:25:19, Surgery)
5. Event 16 (Recovery room, 08:31:37, Surgery)
6. Event 18 (Patient discharged, 08:40:13, Surgery)

Based on this reasoning, there appear to be three distinct cases identified here. However, a key part of this reasoning is that no two events belonging to the same case should have conflicting `patient_age` and `patient_gender` attributes. Thus, events are grouped based on a unique pair of `patient_age` and `patient_gender` values until a "Patient discharged" event indicates the likely end of a case.
