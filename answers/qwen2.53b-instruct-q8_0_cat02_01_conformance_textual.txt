To identify cases that violate the normative process flow, I will go through each case chronologically and check if they follow all the constraints provided in the normative process description.

### Case 1:
- **Receive order**: Correct (09:00)
- **Check inventory**: Correct (10:00)
- **Authorize payment**: Correct (11:00) - Follows "Authorize payment should only occur after 'Check inventory'"
- **Package items**: Correct (12:00) - Follows "Items must be prepared before they can be shipped"
- **Ship order**: Correct (13:00)
- **Close order**: Correct (14:00)

**Explanation for Case 1:** All activities follow the normative process flow.

### Case 2:
- **Receive order**: Correct (09:00)
- **Check inventory**: Correct (09:30) - Note that this comes after "Authorize payment" and "Package items," which violates the constraint of "Authorization of payment should only occur before packaging."
- **Package items**: Correct (10:00)
- **Authorize payment**: Incorrect - This activity does not follow the sequence; it should be done after checking inventory.
- **Ship order**: Incorrect - Since payment was not authorized, this step is invalid per the normative process.
- **Close order**: Incorrect - The case ends with shipping and closing. It cannot close an order that has been canceled.

**Explanation for Case 2:**
- "Authorize payment" happens before checking inventory ("Check inventory" should come immediately after "Receive order").
- After authorization, the next activity should be package items. Since there is no check in between, itâ€™s not following sequence.
- The shipping step occurs even though there's a canceled order.

### Case 3:
- **Receive order**: Correct (09:00)
- **Check inventory**: Correct (09:40) - Note that this comes before "Authorize payment," which violates the constraint of "Authorization of payment should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging."
- **Authorize payment**: Incorrect - This activity happens before checking inventory.
- **Cancel order**: Correct (10:00)
- **Ship order**: Incorrect - After cancellation, shipping is not allowed per the normative process.
- **Close order**: Correct (11:00)

**Explanation for Case 3:**
- "Authorize payment" comes after the inventory check. This directly contradicts the normative sequence.
- The cancel step takes place before the authorizing of payment or packaging, violating the principle that canceling an order should only follow checking inventory and authorization.

### Case 4:
- **Receive order**: Correct (09:00)
- **Check inventory**: Correct (09:10) - Note this comes after "Cancel order," which violates the constraint of a cancellation step preceding any check, let alone inventory checks.
- **Cancel order**: Correct (09:20)
- **Ship order**: Incorrect - Shipping should not occur if the order has been canceled.
- **Close order**: Correct (09:50)

**Explanation for Case 4:**
- "Check inventory" happens before "Cancel order," which is contrary to the normative process that states a cancellation step must precede checking inventory and authorization.

### Case 5:
- **Receive order**: Correct (09:00)
- **Check inventory**: Correct (10:00) - Follows sequence constraints.
- **Authorize payment**: Correct (10:30) - Follows "Authorization of payment should only occur after 'Check inventory'"
- **Ship order**: Incorrect - Shipping is done before the authorization, which violates the normative process flow.
- **Close order**: Correct (11:30)

**Explanation for Case 5:**
- The shipping step occurs first, violating the constraint that "Items must be prepared before they can be shipped."

### Summary of Violations:
- **Case 2:** Authorization of payment happens before checking inventory and does not follow the sequence.
- **Case 3:** Authorization of payment comes after the inventory check. Cancel order should precede any checks.
- **Case 4:** Check inventory happens after canceling an order, which is incorrect according to the normative process flow.
- **Case 5:** Shipping occurs before authorization, violating the constraint that packaging should be done before shipping.

Cases 2, 3, and 4 violate the normative process flow for handling orders as described. Case 5 also violates the flow due to a mistake in activity sequence but does not strictly contradict all norms since it's an exception related to time ordering rather than step order constraints.
