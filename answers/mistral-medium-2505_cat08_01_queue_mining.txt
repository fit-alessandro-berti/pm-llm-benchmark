# **Process Mining and Queue Optimization for Outpatient Clinic**

## **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

### **1.1 Calculating Waiting Times**
Waiting time is defined as the **idle time between the completion of one activity and the start of the next activity** in a patient’s visit. Using the event log data, we calculate waiting time as:

\[
\text{Waiting Time} = \text{Start Timestamp of Activity}_{i+1} - \text{Completion Timestamp of Activity}_i
\]

For example, in the sample log:
- **Waiting time between Registration and Nurse Assessment for Visit V1001**:
  \[
  09:15:20 - 09:08:45 = 6 \text{ minutes and } 35 \text{ seconds}
  \]

### **1.2 Key Queue Metrics**
To characterize queues, we calculate:
- **Average waiting time** (mean) per transition (e.g., Registration  Nurse Assessment).
- **Median waiting time** (to reduce skew from outliers).
- **Maximum waiting time** (worst-case scenario).
- **90th percentile waiting time** (to identify extreme delays).
- **Queue frequency** (how often patients experience delays).
- **Number of cases with excessive waits** (e.g., >30 minutes).

### **1.3 Identifying Critical Queues**
We prioritize queues based on:
1. **Longest average wait times** (e.g., if Doctor Consultation  ECG has an average wait of 25 minutes, it’s a priority).
2. **Highest frequency of delays** (e.g., if 80% of patients wait >15 minutes for Nurse Assessment).
3. **Impact on patient types** (e.g., urgent patients experiencing longer waits).
4. **Downstream bottlenecks** (e.g., delays in Registration causing cascading delays).

## **2. Root Cause Analysis**

### **2.1 Potential Root Causes**
- **Resource bottlenecks**:
  - Limited availability of doctors, nurses, or diagnostic equipment (e.g., only one ECG machine).
  - Staff scheduling gaps (e.g., fewer clerks during peak hours).
- **Activity dependencies**:
  - Sequential workflows (e.g., patients must see a nurse before a doctor, causing backups).
- **Variability in service times**:
  - Some doctors take longer than others, causing uneven flow.
- **Appointment scheduling issues**:
  - Overbooking or poor time slot allocation.
- **Patient arrival patterns**:
  - Walk-ins disrupting scheduled appointments.
- **Patient type differences**:
  - New patients require more time than follow-ups, leading to delays.

### **2.2 Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Analysis**
- **Resource utilization analysis**:
  - Identify underutilized or overloaded staff/equipment.
- **Bottleneck detection**:
  - Use process mining tools (e.g., Disco, Celonis) to visualize flow and pinpoint slowdowns.
- **Variant analysis**:
  - Compare different patient pathways to see which variants cause delays.
- **Time-based clustering**:
  - Group patients by arrival time to detect peak congestion periods.

## **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

### **3.1 Strategy 1: Dynamic Staff Allocation**
- **Target Queue**: Registration  Nurse Assessment (long waits due to clerk shortages).
- **Root Cause**: Fixed staffing leads to bottlenecks during peak hours.
- **Solution**:
  - Use historical data to predict peak times and adjust staff schedules.
  - Implement a **floating clerk** to assist during high-volume periods.
- **Expected Impact**:
  - Reduce average wait time by **20-30%** for Registration.

### **3.2 Strategy 2: Parallel Processing for Diagnostic Tests**
- **Target Queue**: Doctor Consultation  ECG (long waits due to sequential processing).
- **Root Cause**: Patients must wait for a single ECG machine.
- **Solution**:
  - Introduce **pre-appointment ECG scheduling** for high-risk patients.
  - Add a second ECG machine during peak hours.
- **Expected Impact**:
  - Reduce ECG wait times by **40%**.

### **3.3 Strategy 3: Appointment Smoothing Algorithm**
- **Target Queue**: Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation (delays due to overbooking).
- **Root Cause**: Doctors are double-booked, causing backups.
- **Solution**:
  - Implement a **predictive scheduling algorithm** that accounts for:
    - Doctor’s average consultation time.
    - Patient type (new vs. follow-up).
    - Buffer time for urgent cases.
- **Expected Impact**:
  - Reduce doctor wait times by **25-35%**.

## **4. Trade-offs and Constraints**

### **4.1 Potential Trade-offs**
- **Cost vs. Efficiency**:
  - Adding staff or equipment increases costs but reduces wait times.
- **Staff Workload**:
  - Dynamic scheduling may lead to uneven workload distribution.
- **Care Quality**:
  - Rushing patients through may reduce thoroughness.

### **4.2 Balancing Conflicting Objectives**
- **Prioritize high-impact, low-cost changes first** (e.g., scheduling adjustments before hiring).
- **Use simulation modeling** to predict the effect of changes before implementation.
- **Monitor patient satisfaction scores** to ensure quality isn’t compromised.

## **5. Measuring Success**

### **5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- **Average waiting time per transition** (e.g., Registration  Nurse Assessment).
- **Percentage of patients with wait times <15 minutes**.
- **Total visit duration** (from Registration to Check-out).
- **Patient satisfaction scores** (post-visit surveys).

### **5.2 Ongoing Process Monitoring**
- **Continuous event log analysis** to detect new bottlenecks.
- **Real-time dashboards** for clinic managers to track KPIs.
- **A/B testing** of scheduling changes to validate improvements.

### **Conclusion**
By leveraging **process mining and queue analysis**, the clinic can systematically identify bottlenecks, implement targeted optimizations, and continuously monitor performance to ensure sustained improvements in patient flow and satisfaction.
