Here is the most efficient and idiomatic DuckDB SQL query to achieve this task.

DuckDB supports the **`QUALIFY`** clause, which allows you to filter the results of window functions directly without needing subqueries or Common Table Expressions (CTEs). This makes the query significantly more concise and readable.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
QUALIFY COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) <= 6;
```

### Explanation
1.  **`SELECT *`**: Selects all columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, etc.).
2.  **`COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`**: This window function counts the total number of rows associated with the current row's `case_id`.
3.  **`QUALIFY ... <= 6`**: This filters the results after the window function is calculated. It effectively says: "Only keep rows where the total count of events for their `case_id` is less than or equal to 6."

***

### Alternative Approach (Standard SQL)
If you prefer a standard SQL approach that is compatible with systems that do not support `QUALIFY`, you can use a subquery with `HAVING`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```
