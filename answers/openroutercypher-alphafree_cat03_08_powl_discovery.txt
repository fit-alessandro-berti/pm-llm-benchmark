Following the provided scenario and examples, let's break down the process activities and construct the POWL model:

1. **Order Received** (OR) is the starting node.
2. **Material Sourcing** (MS) follows OR.
3. **Quality Screening** (QS) follows MS.
4. **Assembly** (AS) follows QS.
5. **In-line Quality Check** (IQC) follows AS and can loop back to AS if necessary.
6. **Testing** (TST):
    - Can go into Re-Testing (RT) if the product fails initially, then cycles back to TST.
    - If passed, TST moves to **Packaging** (PK).
7. **Packaging** (PK) follows after TST.
8. **Labeling** (LB):
    - Can be skipped in some paths (exclusive choice with a silent transition for skip).
9. **Distribution Planning** (DP) follows PK (or LB, if present).
10. **Dispatch** (D) follows DP.

Here is the POWL model capturing the above relationships:

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, Transition, SilentTransition, OperatorPOWL
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions for the main activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")

# Define silent transitions and choices
skip_lb = SilentTransition()

# Define loop for IQC -> AS and Testing -> Re-Testing
loop_iqc_as = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])
loop_test_rt = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Choice for labeling (LB or skip)
choice_lb = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip_lb])

# Define the root StrictPartialOrder and add the order edges
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, loop_iqc_as, loop_test_rt, PK, choice_lb, DP, D])

# Add execution order between nodes
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)           # OR -> MS
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)           # MS -> QS
root.order.add_edge(QS, loop_iqc_as)  # QS -> Loop(IQC, AS)
root.order.add_edge(loop_iqc_as, loop_test_rt)  # Loop(IQC, AS) -> Loop(TST, RT)
root.order.add_edge(loop_test_rt, PK)  # Loop(TST, RT) -> PK
root.order.add_edge(PK, choice_lb)     # PK -> Choice(LB, skip)
root.order.add_edge(choice_lb, DP)     # Choice(LB, skip) -> DP
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)             # DP -> D
```

### Explanation:
- **Order Received (OR)**: Starts the process.  
- **Material Sourcing (MS)**: Follows OR.
- **Quality Screening (QS)**: Follows MS.
- **Assembly (AS)** and **In-line Quality Check (IQC)**: Represented by a loop where IQC can loop back to AS.
- **Testing (TST)** and **Re-Testing (RT)**: Represented by a loop for TST, with RT looping back to TST if the product fails the initial testing.
- **Packaging (PK)**, **Labeling (LB)**: PK follows the testing loop, and LB is represented by an exclusive choice between LB and a silent transition `skip_lb` for cases when labeling is skipped.
- **Distribution Planning (DP)**: Follows the choice between LB and skip.
- **Dispatch (D)**: Follows DP.

Using this structure, the manufacturing and distribution process of high-end appliances will be accurately modeled with activities, choices, and loops reflecting the dependencies and possible alternative paths in the event log.
