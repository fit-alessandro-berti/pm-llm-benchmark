# Analysis of Insurance Claim Handling Process Anomalies

## 1. Identified Anomalies in the POWL Model

After analyzing the provided POWL model, I've identified several significant anomalies:

1. **Evaluation-Approval Loop**: The model includes a loop structure between "Evaluate Claim (E)" and "Approve Claim (P)". This means a claim could be evaluated and approved multiple times in succession.

2. **Optional Customer Notification**: The XOR operator between "Notify Customer (N)" and a silent transition allows the process to skip customer notification entirely.

3. **Premature Claim Closure**: The partial ordering includes a direct edge from "Assign Adjuster (A)" to "Close Claim (C)", bypassing the evaluation, approval, and notification steps. This could allow claims to be closed without proper processing.

4. **Incomplete Ordering Constraints**: The model doesn't enforce that the XOR (notification decision) must complete before closing the claim, potentially allowing concurrent or out-of-sequence execution.

## 2. Hypotheses on Why These Anomalies Exist

### Hypothesis 1: Iterative Evaluation Process
The evaluation-approval loop might exist because complex claims require multiple rounds of evaluation and partial approvals. Perhaps adjusters need to approve different aspects of a claim separately, or additional information may trigger re-evaluation.

### Hypothesis 2: Selective Notification Policy
The optional customer notification might reflect a business rule where only certain types of claim outcomes (perhaps denials or partial approvals) require explicit customer notification, while others (full approvals) proceed directly to payment.

### Hypothesis 3: Emergency Override Capability
The direct path from assignment to closure might be an intentional "emergency override" feature allowing managers to close claims under exceptional circumstances (e.g., fraudulent claims, withdrawn claims).

### Hypothesis 4: System Migration Artifacts
These anomalies could be artifacts from a system migration where the new process model attempted to accommodate historical process variations that existed in legacy systems.

### Hypothesis 5: Compliance Gap
The model might reflect actual practice rather than ideal process, revealing compliance gaps where employees have been bypassing steps in the intended workflow.

## 3. Database Queries to Verify Hypotheses

### Query 1: Identify Multiple Evaluation-Approval Cycles
This query checks if claims commonly go through multiple evaluation-approval cycles:

```sql
WITH claim_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    ce.claim_id,
    ce.activity,
    ce.timestamp,
    LEAD(ce.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity
  FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.activity IN ('E', 'P')
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  COUNT(*) AS evaluation_approval_cycles
FROM claim_sequences
WHERE activity = 'E' AND next_activity = 'P'
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY evaluation_approval_cycles DESC;
```

### Query 2: Analyze Customer Notification Patterns
This query examines how often customer notification is skipped:

```sql
WITH claim_flow AS (
  SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    CASE WHEN EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce 
      WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'N'
    ) THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS has_notification
  FROM claims c
  WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce 
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
  )
)
SELECT 
  claim_type,
  COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
  SUM(CASE WHEN has_notification THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS with_notification,
  SUM(CASE WHEN NOT has_notification THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS without_notification,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN NOT has_notification THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS skip_percentage
FROM claim_flow
GROUP BY claim_type
ORDER BY skip_percentage DESC;
```

### Query 3: Detect Prematurely Closed Claims
This query identifies claims that were closed without proper evaluation or approval:

```sql
SELECT 
  c.claim_id,
  c.claim_type,
  c.claim_amount,
  c.submission_date,
  a.name AS assigned_adjuster,
  STRING_AGG(ce.activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS activity_sequence
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
WHERE c.claim_id IN (
  SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C'
  EXCEPT
  (SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'E'
   INTERSECT
   SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P')
)
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount, c.submission_date, a.name
ORDER BY c.submission_date DESC;
```

### Query 4: Analyze Process Variants and Their Frequency
This query identifies the most common process paths and their frequencies:

```sql
WITH claim_paths AS (
  SELECT 
    claim_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '' ORDER BY timestamp) AS path
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
  path,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
FROM claim_paths
GROUP BY path
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Query 5: Investigate Adjuster-Specific Patterns
This query examines if certain adjusters are more likely to follow anomalous paths:

```sql
WITH adjuster_patterns AS (
  SELECT 
    a.adjuster_id,
    a.name,
    a.specialization,
    ce.claim_id,
    CASE 
      WHEN NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'E') THEN 'Missing_Evaluation'
      WHEN NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'P') THEN 'Missing_Approval'
      WHEN NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'N') THEN 'Missing_Notification'
      ELSE 'Complete'
    END AS process_pattern
  FROM claim_events ce
  JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
  WHERE ce.activity = 'A'  -- Adjuster assignment event
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'C')  -- Closed claims only
)
SELECT 
  adjuster_id,
  name,
  specialization,
  COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
  SUM(CASE WHEN process_pattern = 'Complete' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS complete_processes,
  SUM(CASE WHEN process_pattern != 'Complete' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS anomalous_processes,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN process_pattern != 'Complete' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS anomaly_percentage,
  COUNT(DISTINCT process_pattern) AS pattern_variety
FROM adjuster_patterns
GROUP BY adjuster_id, name, specialization
ORDER BY anomaly_percentage DESC;
```

These queries would help verify our hypotheses and provide insights into whether the anomalies in the POWL model reflect actual business practices or represent process design flaws that need to be addressed.
