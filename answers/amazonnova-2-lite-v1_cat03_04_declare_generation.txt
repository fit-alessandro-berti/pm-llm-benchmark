### **DECLARE Model for Product Design and Launch Process**

Below is a Python dictionary representing a **DECLARE model** for the **multi-department product design and launch process** in a manufacturing company. The model captures the **declarative constraints** that govern the sequence and relationship between activities. Each rule is represented with **support = 1.0** and **confidence = 1.0**, indicating that these constraints are **always true** in the idealized process.

##  **Python Dictionary: DECLARE Model**

```python
declare_model = {
    # ------------------------------
    # **Basic Constraints**
    # ------------------------------

    # Existence: Activities that must occur at least once
    'existence': {
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},   # Idea Generation must exist
        'DD': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},   # Design Draft must exist

    },

    # Absence: Activities that must **not** occur
    'absence': {
        # No example here: In practice, you might define an activity that should never happen,
        # e.g., 'RushedLaunch' or 'SkipTesting', but not needed for this ideal workflow.
    },

    # Exactly One: Only one of a set of activities may occur
    'exactly_one': {
        # No example here: In this process, multiple paths may coexist, and no single activity is mutually exclusive.
        # Example could be: Only one type of testing can be performed, but in this model both LT and UT are required.
    },

    # Init: Activities that must occur at the **start** of the process
    'init': {
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}   # Idea Generation must be the first activity
    },

    # ------------------------------
    # **Temporal & Dependency Constraints**

    # Response: Activity A must be followed eventually by activity B

    # Precedence: Activity B must be followed eventually by activity A
    'precedence': {
        'TFC': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},     # DD must happen before TFC
        'CE': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},      # TFC must happen before CE

    },

    # Succession: Activity A must be directly followed by activity B (no other activity in between)
    'succession': {
        # Example: 'DD': 'TFC' means DD must be immediately followed by TFC
        # In this model, we assume each step must happen in direct succession without skipping
        # You can specify direct successions if needed. For simplicity, we use response/precedence here.

    },

    # NonCoexistence: Two activities cannot occur together (in the same case)
    'noncoexistence': {
        # Example: 'LT': 'UT' — they cannot happen at the same time
        # But in our process, they occur sequentially, so no overlap.
        # You can add if needed.
    },

    # Nonsuccession: A cannot be directly followed by B
    'nonsuccession': {
        # Example: 'DD': 'AG' — Design Draft cannot be directly followed by Approval Gate
        # This prevents skipping intermediate steps.

    # Nonchainsuccession: A cannot be followed by a chain of B and C
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        # Not needed for this model.
    },

    # Responded Existence: If A occurs, B must also occur
    'responded_existence': {
        # These are redundant with existence and response, but can be used to emphasize dependency
        'DD': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},     # If DD occurs, TFC must occur
        'TFC': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},    # If TFC occurs, CE must occur

###  **How to Use This Model**

This dictionary can be used with **pm4py** to:

- **Discover** declarative Petri nets from event logs.
- **Verify** conformance of event logs against the model.
- **Simulate** process execution based on the constraints.

Example usage with pm4py:

```python
from pm4py import declare_model_check_conformance

# Assume `log` is your event log and `declare_model` is the dictionary above
is_conformant, diagnostics = declare_model_check_conformance(log, declare_model)
print("Conformant:", is_conformant)
```

---

###  **Summary**

This **DECLARE model** accurately captures the **sequential and dependency logic** of a **product design and launch process**, ensuring that all required activities occur in the correct order, with no skipping or premature jumps. It is suitable for **process mining**, **process enforcement**, and **simulation** in manufacturing environments.
