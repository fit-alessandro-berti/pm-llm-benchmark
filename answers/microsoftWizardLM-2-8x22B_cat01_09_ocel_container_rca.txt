 Based on the provided object-centric event log and the directly follows graph for different object types, we can identify several potential root causes for performance issues in the process. Here are some insights specific to the data and process:

1. **High Frequency of Repeated Activities for Certain Objects:**
   - For the Truck object type, "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" has a high frequency of 8559 events but only involves 6 trucks. This suggests that the same trucks are being loaded multiple times, which could indicate inefficiency or a bottleneck at the loading stage.
   - Similarly, for the Vehicle object type, "Load to Vehicle" -> "Load to Vehicle" has 1827 events for 127 vehicles, indicating that vehicles are being loaded multiple times, which might not be the most efficient use of resources.

2. **Long Durations Between Certain Activities:**
   - The "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck" transition for the Truck object type has a very long duration of 84119.09, which could indicate significant waiting times or delays in the process.
   - "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" for the Container object type has an exceptionally long duration of 743380.51, which could point to a bottleneck or underutilization of resources in transitioning containers from stock to loading bays.
   - The "Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle" transition for the Vehicle object type has a duration of 152433.14, which is quite long and could suggest challenges incoordinating container movements or scheduling conflicts.

3. **Inefficient Container Handling:**
   - The "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" transition for the Container object type has a very long duration of 368943.92, which might indicate difficulties in procuring or transporting empty containers.
   - The "Place in Stock" -> "Place in Stock" transition for the Forklift object type, although infrequent, has a long duration per event, which could indicate poor inventory management or inefficiency in stock handling.

4. **Frequent Rescheduling:**
