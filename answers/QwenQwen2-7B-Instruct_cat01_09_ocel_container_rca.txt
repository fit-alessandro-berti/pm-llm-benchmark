Analyzing the directly follows graph provided, we can identify several root causes for performance issues within the process. To create a focused list, specific process data, and object types are used to pinpoint areas of concern:

### 1. Overutilization of Containers and Vehicles
- **Containers:** The high frequency of "Load Truck" events and subsequent use in "Drive to Terminal" suggests containers might be frequently being transported. This could lead to operational inefficiencies if containers are not being used optimally or if there is an issue with container capacity management. 
- **Vehicles:** The "Load to Vehicle"  Vehicle loop (multiple "Load to Vehicle" - "Book Vehicles") might indicate issues with vehicle assignment or lack of coordinating vehicle release prior to container departure, potentially leading to wasted time and resources.

### 2. Time Constraints and Efficiency
- **Terminal Processes:** The extended duration associated with "Drive to Terminal" (averaging well over an hour, e.g., 10999.07 seconds) points to possible bottlenecks or inefficient transport logistics, affecting throughput speed.
- **Container Processing:** Delays in "Place in Stock"  "Bring to Loading Bay" and "Place in Stock" (duration over a minute and hours) could indicate issues related to stock management, container handling, or equipment capacity.

### 3. Resource Coordination
- **Undersupply of Resources:** Frequencies in the "Order Empty Containers"  "Pick Up Empty Container" and "Order Empty Containers"  "Book Vehicles" loops suggest ongoing demand for additional containers and vehicles, which could indicate a supply chain shortage. Resource over or mismatch in availability might lead to delays and congestion.
- **Disputes in Free Containers and Vehicles:** The discrepancy in object frequency and durations might hint at contention or possessive disposition of containers and vehicles. Resource allocation and management strategies are crucial for smoother operation.

### 4. Preventive Maintenance and Equipment Issues
- **Equipment Aging:** Given the relatively steady duration for "Load Truck" past its most frequent use, it might suggest the process is operating within normal performance margins without signs of equipment degradation.
- **Maintenance Backlog:** However, sudden spikes in downtime durations or service times for equipment could indicate maintenance backlogs, affecting process flow and efficiency.

### 5. Resource Planning and Prioritization
- **Resource Cross-Dependency:** Dependencies such as "Book Vehicles" and "Order Empty Containers" indicate that resource planning might not be aligned, potentially leading to inefficient
