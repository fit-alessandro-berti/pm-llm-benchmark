Based on your provided data, here are some main anomalies:

1. **Frequencies don't add up**: Some processes have frequencies that don't add up to their parent process. For example:
	* `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification` has a frequency of 34, but the sum of its children's frequencies is 31 (32 + 23).
	* `Create Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Add penalty -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture` has a frequency of 30, but the sum of its children's frequencies is 28.
2. **Inconsistent payment frequencies**: Some processes have multiple payments with different frequencies. For example:
	* `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Payment` and `Create Fine -> Payment -> Payment` both have frequencies of 12.
	* `Create Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Add penalty -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture -> Notify Result Appeal to Offender` has two payments with frequencies of 15 and 20.
3. **Unbalanced branches**: Some processes have branches that are not well-balanced in terms of frequency. For example:
	* `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment` has a frequency of 19, while its child process `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge` has a frequency of 23.
4. **Multiple notifications**: Some processes have multiple notification events with different frequencies. For example:
	* `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture` has three notification events with frequencies of 15, 20, and 22.
5. **Irregular frequency patterns**: Some processes have irregular frequency patterns, making it difficult to identify trends or anomalies. For example:
	* `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture` has a complex pattern of frequencies (30, 32, 23, ...).
