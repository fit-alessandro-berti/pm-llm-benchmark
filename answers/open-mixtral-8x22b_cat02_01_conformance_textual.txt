1. The cases in the event log that violate the normative process are cases 2 and 3.

2. Case 2 violates the normative process in the following ways:

   - "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment," but in this case, it occurs before. This is a violation of the rule that payment authorization should occur before packaging, since items must be prepared for shipment only after the payment is confirmed.

   - "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items," but in this case, the sequence is not followed correctly. This violates the rule that items should be prepared before they can be shipped.

Case 3 violates the normative process in the following ways:

   - "Cancel order" should only occur after checking the inventory and finding insufficient stock, which is followed in this case. However, the process should not proceed with "Ship order" after a cancellation. This violates the rule that shipping should never occur after cancellation.

   - "Close order" should be the final activity in all scenarios, which is followed in this case. However, the sequence of activities that led to the closing of the order is incorrect, as "Ship order" should not have occurred after "Cancel order."

Overall, the cases in the event log that do not follow the normative process have violations in the sequence of activities, specifically related to the order of payment authorization, packaging, and shipping, as well as the handling of order cancellations.
