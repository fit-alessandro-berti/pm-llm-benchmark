# Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Optimizing Resource Assignment at TechSolve Solutions

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### Key Metrics & Analysis Techniques

**Metrics to Focus On:**
- **Workload Distribution:** Compare average ticket volume per agent across L1, L2, L3 tiers.
- **Processing Times:** Measure the time taken from case creation to resolution for each tier/agent combination (e.g., Avg. Time L1  P3).
- **First Call Resolution Rate (FCR):** Calculate FCR specifically within skill categories (Hardware, Software-OS, etc.) and per agent tier.
- **Escalation Frequency:** Track the rate of escalations from L1 to higher tiers for each ticket category/Skill Requirement.

**Process Mining Techniques:**
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** Use this technique to map how agents interact with different tickets across Tiers. This reveals handoff points, common skills used, and decision trees (e.g., “If P2 & Network  L2”).
- **Social Network Analysis based on Handovers:** Visualize the network of interactions between agents for a ticket—how often does an agent from Tier X pass to Tier Y? Identify clusters or chains that could cause bottlenecks.
- **Role Discovery (Process Mining Role):** Discover hidden roles, especially when L1 agents assume responsibilities typically reserved for higher tiers. This reveals if specialized skills are being overutilized by less skilled agents.

### Comparison with Intended Logic

The actual assignment patterns uncovered via process mining should be compared against the intended logic from policies and agent skill profiles:

- **Skill-Based vs Round-Robin:** Determine whether current assignments follow a pure round-robin (ignores required skills) or attempts to match based on specific requirements. Discrepancies reveal inefficiencies in how agents are matched with tasks.
- **Escalation Triggers:** Compare the frequency and conditions of escalations defined by policies versus actual occurrences derived from the log.

### Skill Utilization

**Analysis:**
1. Track ticket categories (e.g., *Software-App* for App-CRM) alongside agent skills in a skill matrix to see utilization rates.
2. Identify specialized tasks often handled by non-specialist agents or vice versa—this may indicate overutilization of specific skills or underutilization where appropriate specialists are absent.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### Common Problems & Quantification 

**Potential Problem Areas Identified:**
- **Bottlenecks Due to Skill Gaps:** Agents with low availability for high-demand categories like *Security-IAM* or *Database-SQL* due to skill mismatch.
- **Excessive Reassignments/Escalations:** Calculate the average number of reassignments per ticket and correlate with resolution times. High values suggest either misassignment at L1 (e.g., unskillful agents) or ineffective escalation criteria.

**Impact Quantification:**
- *Average Delay Per Reassignment:* Measure time added for each instance where a case is reassigned.
  - Example Calculation: If an average of 2 hours delay occurs per reassignment and there are 5 such instances daily, the total impact equates to **10 additional hours wasted per day**.
  
- **SLA Breach Linkage:** Use statistical analysis (e.g., chi-square tests) to correlate specific assignment patterns with SLA breaches. If P3 tickets assigned by L1 often breach SLAs, this provides a direct correlation point for corrective action.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

**Potential Causes & Mitigation Paths:**

- **Skill Mismatch:** Insufficient training or outdated skill profiles may cause agents to be tasked with beyond their expertise.
  - *Mitigation:* Update agent skill databases regularly, facilitate refresher courses on high-demand skills (e.g., DB-SQL), and introduce a "skill gap analysis" during initial ticket categorization.

- **Purposely Inaccurate Categorization:** Agents might misclassify tickets leading to improper skill assignment.
  - *Mitigation:* Implement automated classification rules based on keyword patterns or use natural language processing (NLP) tools. Cross-check with manual reviews for critical/highly complex cases requiring L2/L3 intervention.

- **Lack of Real-time Visibility:** Without real-time workload visibility, reassignments may occur without context.
  - *Mitigation:* Deploy dashboards showing live agent availability and ticket backlog across tiers to enable proactive task assignment rather than ad hoc escalation.

- **Inadequate Training/Empowerment for L1 Agents:** Over-reliance on L2/L3 can stem from lack of training or empowerment in handling routine tasks.
  - *Mitigation:* Conduct periodic refresher trainings, incentivize completing ticket categorization and skill assessments to promote independence. Provide knowledge bases tailored per category (e.g., App-CRM troubleshooting).

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

**Proposed Strategies:**

1. **Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weights**
   - *Implementation:* Introduce a routing algorithm that assigns tickets based on the agent's proficiency level for required skills, weighted by historical performance.
   - *Data Required:* Agent skill profiles (proficiency ratings), ticket categories/Skill Requirement mapping.

2. **Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**
   - *Mechanism:* Implement an algorithm considering current queue length per tier and agent availability to distribute tickets proportionally rather than strictly round-robin.
   - *Benefit:* Reduces bottlenecks, especially during peak hours by matching ticket volume with available resources more effectively.

3. **Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Characteristics**
   - *Method:* Use machine learning (e.g., decision trees or neural networks) to predict required skills based on the description and category of a new ticket.
   - *Benefit:* Shortens time-to-resolution for complex cases by pre-assigning agents with appropriate expertise, minimizing unnecessary escalations.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- **Data Requirements:** Agent proficiency data (skill ratings), historical assignment logs, real-time workload metrics. 
- **Technology Stack:** Integration of a process mining platform capable of simulating the new routing algorithms alongside existing ITSM tools to ensure seamless operation.
  
## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### Business Process Simulation Approach
1. *Modeling*: Create a detailed simulation model using extracted event log data (including agent tiers, skill matrices, ticket attributes). Tools like AnyLogic or Simul8 can be employed here.
2. *Scenario Testing:* Run simulations under various conditions—normal load vs peak hour loads—to predict outcomes of proposed strategies before implementation.

### Monitoring Plan Post-Implementation
**Key KPIs:**
- **Resolution Time:** Total time from ticket creation to closure for each tier/agent and skill category.
- **First Call Resolution Rate (FCR):** Improved metrics will indicate success in aligning resources with required skills.
- **Escalation Reduction Ratio:** Decrease in the percentage of tickets escalated beyond Tier 2 compared to baseline.
- **Utilization Rates:** Agent workload distribution across L1/L2/L3 tiers, especially for specialized skill usage.

**Continuous Monitoring Dashboard:**
- **Resource Utilization Views:** Real-time charts showing agent availability vs ticket volume by category and tier.
- **Process Flow Visualizations:** Interactive maps or diagrams illustrating the current assignment flow versus optimized version post-strategy changes (e.g., highlighting reduced reassignments).
- **SLA Compliance Trends:** Graphs tracking SLA breach rates pre/post strategy rollout.

**Review Cadence:**
- Weekly dashboards to identify trends.
- Monthly deep-dive analyses of KPI evolution with root cause insights from process mining analysis.
