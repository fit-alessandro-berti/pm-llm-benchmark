To model the complex hospital patient management scenario using the given operators and notation, we need to construct a process tree that accurately represents the sequence, choices, concurrency, and loops described in the scenario. Below is the process tree representation:

```plaintext
-> (
    -> (
        -> (
            -> (
                'A',
                -> (
                    'RG',
                    'IA'
                )
            ),
            -> (
                'TI',
                'TC'
            )
        ),
        X (
            'CE',
            'FBP'
        )
    ),
    * (
        'SC',
        X (
            'TM',
            'SPT'
        ),
        X (
            'FCE',
            'FBA'
        )
    ),
    + (
        'AI',
        'NC'
    ),
    -> (
        'FAS',
        'DDI'
    ),
    + (
        'BL',
        'ICP',
        'MRF'
    )
)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Arrival, Registration, and Intake Assessment**:
   - The patient arrives (`A`), then registers (`RG`), and undergoes an intake assessment (`IA`). This is represented as a sequence: `-> ( 'A', -> ( 'RG', 'IA' ) )`.

2. **Triage Interview and Classification**:
   - After the intake assessment, the patient undergoes a triage interview (`TI`) and then a triage classification (`TC`). This is another sequence: `-> ( 'TI', 'TC' )`.

3. **Initial Diagnostic Test**:
   - Based on the triage classification, the patient either undergoes a comprehensive ECG (`CE`) or a full blood panel (`FBP`). This is an exclusive choice: `X ( 'CE', 'FBP' )`.

4. **Loop for Abnormal Results**:
   - If the results are abnormal, the patient enters a loop:
     - The patient sees a specialist consultation (`SC`).
     - Then, there is an exclusive choice between targeted medication (`TM`) or specialized physical therapy (`SPT`).
     - After treatment, the patient undergoes a re-diagnostic test, which is another exclusive choice between follow-up ECG (`FCE`) or follow-up blood analysis (`FBA`).
     - This loop can repeat until the results are normal: `* ( 'SC', X ( 'TM', 'SPT' ), X ( 'FCE', 'FBA' ) )`.

5. **Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling**:
   - After normal results, the patient undergoes advanced imaging (`AI`) and nutritional counseling (`NC`) in true concurrency: `+ ( 'AI', 'NC' )`.

6. **Follow-up Appointment Scheduling and Detailed Discharge Instructions**:
   - The patient then schedules a follow-up appointment (`FAS`) and receives detailed discharge instructions (`DDI`) in sequence: `-> ( 'FAS', 'DDI' )`.

7. **Final Administrative and Financial Clearances**:
   - Finally, the patient goes through billing (`BL`), insurance claims processing (`ICP`), and medical records finalization (`MRF`) in true concurrency: `+ ( 'BL', 'ICP', 'MRF' )`.

        X (
            'TM',
            'SPT'
        ),
        X (
            'FCE',
            'FBA'
        )
    ),
    + (
        'AI',
        'NC'
    ),
    -> (
        'FAS',
        'DDI'
    ),
    + (
        'BL',
        'ICP',

    )
)
```

This process tree captures the entire complex process of the hospital patient management scenario, including sequences, exclusive choices, concurrency, and loops.
