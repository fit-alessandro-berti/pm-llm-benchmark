## BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

### Roles/Participants:
- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- Purchasing Officer (Dan)
- Department Manager (Carlos)
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) *(handles exceptions/escalations)*
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) *(handles supplier communication & resolution)*
- External Supplier *(invoice initiator)*
- Accounting System *(used for logging and matching invoices)*

---

### Start Event:
- Invoice received from external supplier (usually via email)

### Activities and Flow:

**Step 1: Invoice Reception** *(performed by:** Accounts Payable Clerk*)*
- Check if the invoice includes a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.

**Gateway: Is invoice associated with valid PO number?**
- **If YES (PO present)**: proceed to "Logging Invoice into Accounting System."
- **If NO (PO missing)**: communicate back to supplier requesting additional details (PO number).

(After completing missing PO issue, invoice may re-enter Step 1.)

---

**Step 2: Logging Invoice into Accounting System** *(Accounts Payable Clerk)*  
- Invoice details recorded in the accounting system.

---

**Step 3: Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department for Goods/Service Confirmation** *(Accounts Payable Clerk  Purchasing Officer)*  
- Purchaser notified via email that invoice is ready for confirmation.

---

**Step 4: Purchasing Department Invoice Verification** *(Purchasing Officer)*  
- Purchasing Officer compares the invoice details (quantities, pricing, delivery charges) against original PO details.

**Gateway: Does invoice match ordered goods/services and prices?**
- **If YES (Invoice matches)**: Purchasing Officer sends confirmation to Accounts Payable Clerk.
- **If NO (Discrepancy identified)**: Purchasing Officer either:
    - Contacts supplier directly for correction OR
    - Requests Accounts Payable to hold invoice until a revised version from supplier is received.

  *(Supplier Relationship Manager may be engaged here if supplier contact or contract validation is needed.)*

*(Upon correction or resolution, invoice returns to Step 4 or Step 2 for re-verification.)*

---

**Step 5: PO and Invoice Matching** *(Accounts Payable Clerk)*  
- Upon confirmation from Purchasing, Clerk matches invoice line items against the PO in the accounting system.

**Gateway: Is the invoice fully matched within the system?**
- **If YES (successfully matched)**: Invoice moves forward to managerial approval.
- **If NO (unsuccessful matching due to discrepancies or missing/incomplete information)**:
   - Contact Purchasing department for clarification and/or
   - Escalate unresolved discrepancies/issues to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).

*(Supplier Relationship Manager may become involved if supplier interaction or contract verification is needed.)*

*(Supervisor-assisted resolution or clarification provided; invoice returns to matching step after solving discrepancies.)*

---

**Step 6: Managerial Approval** *(Department Manager)*  
- The manager receives an automated system notification providing invoice and verification details.
- Manager reviews and checks against budgeted amounts.

**Gateway: Manager approval decision**
- **If Approved**: Manager approves invoice in the system.
- **If Rejected or Delayed due to discrepancies/questions**: Manager contacts Accounts Payable Clerk directly to investigate and resolve.

*(Accounts Payable Supervisor might assist Clerk in case of complex issues raised by Manager.)*

*(Once resolved, invoice returns to Manager for re-approval.)*

---

**Step 7: Schedule Invoice for Payment** *(Accounts Payable Clerk)*  
- Invoice approved by Manager is scheduled in the accounting system for next payment cycle.

---

### Alternate Exception Pathways and Escalations:

- **Missing Purchase Order Number**:
  - Initially returned to supplier by AP Clerk.
  - If recurring or special/informal invoice scenario, Accounts Payable Supervisor collaborates with department heads to create retrospective PO or decide rejection.

- **Persistent Invoice Discrepancies or Supplier-related Issues**:
  - Escalated to Accounts Payable Supervisor and/or Supplier Relationship Manager.
  - Supervisor (Rita) coordinates internal resolutions.
  - Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) oversees supplier interactions, ensures corrected invoices are received, verifies pricing & agreements.

---

### Artifacts/Documents/Data Objects:
- Invoice (external document from supplier)
- Purchase Order (PO reference)
- Confirmation emails (Purchasing  Accounts Payable)
- Accounting system records (matched invoices, scheduled for payment)

---

### End Events:
- Invoice successfully scheduled for payment run (regular end event).
- Invoice Rejected due to irresolvable discrepancies or missing approvals (exceptional end event, after formal decision).

---

### Notes on Process Ambiguities / Points of Uncertainty:
- Interviewees presented uncertainty about responsibility for direct supplier contacts during discrepancies (sometimes Purchasing, sometimes Accounts Payable Supervisor, sometimes Supplier Relationship Manager).
- Occasionally the process loops back multiple times between Purchasing and Accounts Payable when discrepancies persist.
- In rare cases, managers temporarily halt approval demanding deeper investigation.

This textual BPMN-like model integrates multiple viewpoints, resolving ambiguities to the fullest extent possible while noting areas where stakeholder roles overlap or remain fluid.
