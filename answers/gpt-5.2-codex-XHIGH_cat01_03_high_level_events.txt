Below is one coherent way to aggregate the lowlevel events into higherlevel process steps, along with the rationale for each grouping. The same grouping applies to both A1 and B2 because the event patterns are identical.

##  Proposed HighLevel Process Steps

| HighLevel Step (Proposed Name) | LowLevel Events Included | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Material Preparation & Setup** | Retrieve raw metal sheet  Scan barcode  Place metal sheet on table  Align metal sheet  Preheat metal sheet | These actions happen first, are temporally close, and collectively prepare and identify the raw material before any joining work. They represent the setup phase. |
| **2. Welding / Assembly** | Pick up welding tool  Weld corner A  Weld corner B | All are performed by the same operator, occur sequentially, and represent the physical joining of the part. Tool pickup is part of the welding operation. |
| **3. InProcess Weld Inspection** | Measure weld integrity | Immediate quality check right after welding; distinct sensorbased inspection step before finishing. |
| **4. Surface Finishing (Coating & Curing)** | Apply protective coating  Dry coating | These steps are sequential, performed by coating/heating equipment, and together form the protective finishing stage. |
| **5. Final Inspection / Release** | Visual check | A last manual inspection after finishing, determining pass/fail before release. |

## Example Mapping per Case (A1 shown; B2 identical)

```
Case A1:
1) Material Preparation & Setup (08:00:05–08:00:20)
2) Welding / Assembly            (08:01:00–08:01:10)
3) InProcess Weld Inspection    (08:01:20)
4) Surface Finishing             (08:01:30–08:01:45)
5) Final Inspection / Release    (08:02:00)
```

## Summary of Grouping Logic
- **Temporal proximity:** Events occur in tight clusters.
- **Shared purpose:** Each cluster contributes to one logical manufacturing stage.
- **Resource coherence:** Same operators/machines used within each step.
- **Process flow:** Steps follow typical manufacturing phases (prep  assembly  inspection  finishing  final check).

If you want, I can also output this as JSON or a formal mapping rule for automated aggregation.
