What you are looking at is a “spaghetti-style” timeline that shows, for every single case in a fines-handling process, when each of three key activities happened and how much time elapsed between them.

1. X-axis (left to right): calendar time – it runs from 25 Jan 2000 to 24 Apr 2013.
2. Y-axis (top to bottom): the three activities, in the order they normally occur.
   • Send Fine  
   • Insert Fine Notification  
   • Send for Credit Collection  

3. Each thin poly-line represents one case (one fine):
   • Grey vertical segments join “Send Fine” to the immediately following “Insert Fine Notification”.  
     They are almost perfectly vertical because those two steps usually happen within seconds or minutes of each
     other; hence they form a dense grey “curtain” at the top of the figure.  
   • Pink/red diagonal segments join “Insert Fine Notification” to “Send for Credit Collection”.  
     Only a subset of fines reach the credit-collection stage, and they do so after very different
     waiting times.  The longer the delay, the flatter the diagonal; the shorter the delay, the steeper it is.

4. What the picture tells you
   • There are a huge number of “Send Fine” and “Insert Fine Notification” events across the entire 13-year period.  
   • The transition from sending the fine to inserting the notification is virtually instantaneous for almost every case.  
   • Far fewer cases are forwarded to credit collection, and the time between notification and collection varies
     from perhaps a few weeks to several years, producing the fan-shaped pattern of red lines.  
   • No strong seasonality jumps out; instead, activity is fairly continuous over time, with sporadic bursts where many cases are handed over to collection at once (clusters of red lines).

In short, the visualization simultaneously conveys volume (how many cases), sequence (the ordering of the three activities) and performance (how long it takes to move from one activity to the next) for every single fines case recorded between 2000 and 2013.
