This analysis leverages Process Mining principles by examining the sequence and timing of events to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the support ticket resolution process.

## 1. Identification of Significantly Longer Resolution Times

First, we calculate the total resolution time (Cycle Time) for each case, from the "Receive Ticket" event to the "Close Ticket" event.

| Case ID | Start Timestamp (Receive) | End Timestamp (Close) | Total Resolution Time |
| :------ | :------------------------ | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00          | 2024-03-01 10:15      | **2 hours 15 mins**   |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05          | 2024-03-02 09:15      | **25 hours 10 mins**  |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10          | 2024-03-01 09:30      | **1 hour 20 mins**    |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20          | 2024-03-02 08:30      | **24 hours 10 mins**  |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25          | 2024-03-03 09:30      | **49 hours 5 mins**   |

**Conclusion:**

*   **Baseline/Efficient Cases:** Case 103 (80 minutes) and Case 101 (135 minutes) represent the typical, efficient resolution path.
*   **Outlier Cases (Significantly Delayed):** Cases **102, 104, and 105** are the outliers. Their cycle times are 11 to 36 times longer than the efficient cases, suggesting major performance issues.

## 2. Determination of Potential Root Causes (Performance Issues)

Analyzing the process flow and time segments for the delayed cases reveals several recurring bottlenecks:

### A. Major Bottleneck: Escalation Handoff (Affecting 102, 105)

Cases requiring escalation to a Level-2 agent introduce severe delays in the handover stage. This suggests a capacity or availability issue with the specialized team.

| Case ID | Escalation Time (End L1) | L2 Start Time (Investigate) | Delay (Wait for L2 Pickup) |
| :------ | :----------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 11:30         | 2024-03-01 14:00            | **2 hours 30 minutes**     |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 10:00         | 2024-03-02 14:00            | **28 hours 0 minutes**     |

The 28-hour delay in Case 105 is the most dramatic bottleneck in the entire dataset. In both escalated cases, the handover time is unacceptable, implying Level-2 agents are either severely backlogged or lack a rapid notification system for new escalated tickets.

### B. Secondary Bottleneck: Level-1 Agent Availability/Workload (Affecting 104)

Case 104 did not require escalation, but still took over 24 hours. The delay occurred before the agent even started investigating.

| Case ID | Activity (Previous) | Timestamp | Activity (Next) | Timestamp | Delay Segment |
| :------ | :------------------ | :-------- | :-------------- | :-------- | :------------ |
| 104     | Assign to L1 Agent  | 09:30     | Investigate Issue | 13:00     | **3 hours 30 minutes** waiting before investigation starts. |

This indicates a significant lag between the agent being assigned the ticket and starting the actual work. This points to potential issues with agent prioritization, excessive workload, or poor queue management at Level 1.

### C. Pattern: Prolonged Investigation and Cross-Day Resolution

In all three outlier cases (102, 104, 105), once the investigation starts, the time until resolution consistently spans into the next calendar day (approx. 19 hours). This suggests:

1.  **Complexity:** The issues requiring long investigation times (even by L1 in Case 104) are inherently complex.
2.  **Lack of Shift Handoff:** The process may lack robust mechanisms for support agents to efficiently hand off complex, in-progress investigations to the next shift, leading to tickets waiting overnight before the original agent (or a new agent) can pick them up the next morning.

## 3. Insights and Recommendations

The primary performance bottleneck is related to the **Escalation Process** and the **Capacity/Prioritization** of agents, particularly at Level 2.

### Performance Insights

| Root Cause Identified | Impact on Cycle Time |
| :-------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Escalation Handoff**| Adds 2.5 to 28 hours of pure idle time to the ticket lifecycle. This accounts for the majority of the delay in cases 102 and 105. |
| **L1 Agent Wait Time** | Adds multi-hour delays (3.5 hours in Case 104) before work commences, suggesting L1 agents are either inefficiently managed or suffering from high immediate workload after assignment. |
| **Cross-Day Resolution** | Indicates that the definition of a "resolved" ticket requires long periods of active investigation that cannot be completed within a single shift (approximately 8 hours). |

### Recommendations for Addressing Bottlenecks

#### 1. Optimize Level-2 Escalation Protocol

*   **Service Level Objective (SLO) for Handoff:** Implement a strict Service Level Objective (SLO) for Level 2 agents to pick up an escalated ticket (i.e., transition from 'Escalate' to 'Investigate') within a specific time frame (e.g., 30 minutes).
*   **Capacity Review:** Conduct a resource capacity analysis for Level 2. The 28-hour delay in Case 105 strongly suggests that L2 resources are insufficient for the current volume or complexity of required escalations.
*   **Automated Notification:** Implement urgent, multi-channel alerts (e.g., email, SMS, internal chat) when a ticket is escalated, ensuring L2 agents are immediately aware of the new priority item.

#### 2. Improve Agent Workload Management (L1 & L2)

*   **Triage Refinement:** Improve the initial 'Triage Ticket' phase to better identify and route highly complex issues directly to specialized L2 queues, bypassing initial L1 investigation if certain keywords or severity levels are present. In Case 105, the L1 agent spent less than an hour investigating before escalating, suggesting the Triage step might have failed to properly classify the required expertise.
*   **Measure Wait Time:** Introduce a metric tracking the time between "Assign" and the first "Investigate" activity. Agents with consistently long wait times should be coached or have their workload adjusted.

#### 3. Implement Robust Shift Handoff Procedures

*   **Standardized Notes:** Enforce mandatory, comprehensive note-taking before the end of a shift for any ticket in the "Investigate Issue" state to allow seamless transition.
*   **Dedicated Handoff Time:** Allocate a specific time window at the end of each shift for L1 and L2 agents to review and hand over open, active tickets to the incoming shift supervisor or agent, preventing the ticket from waiting idle overnight (as seen in Cases 102, 104, and 105).
