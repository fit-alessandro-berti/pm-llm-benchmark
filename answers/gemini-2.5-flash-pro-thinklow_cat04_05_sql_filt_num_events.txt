Excellent draft. This is a very clear and well-defined task that tests fundamental SQL concepts: aggregation (`GROUP BY`), filtering on aggregates (`HAVING`), and then using that result to filter the original dataset (often with a subquery, CTE, or window function).

To elevate this from a good prompt to an excellent, robust benchmark prompt, we can add a few key elements:

1.  **Reproducibility:** Provide concrete `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements. This makes the prompt self-contained and allows for automated, verifiable testing.
2.  **Explicit Expected Output:** Show *exactly* what the result set should look like based on the provided sample data. This removes all ambiguity.
3.  **Structure:** Organize the prompt into clear sections (`Context`, `Task`, `Setup`, `Expected Output`).

Here is a revised version incorporating these improvements.

### **Revised and Enhanced Benchmark Prompt**

**Prompt Title:** SQL Query to Filter Process Cases by Event Count

**Context:**
You are a data analyst working with a process mining dataset. The data is stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`. Each row in this table represents a single event in a business process. Events are grouped into cases using a `case_id`.

**Task:**
Write a single DuckDB SQL query that retrieves all event data for process cases that have a total of **six or fewer** events. Cases with more than six events should be excluded entirely from the final result.

**Database Schema and Sample Data:**
Use the following SQL statements to set up the `event_log` table and populate it with sample data. The sample data includes cases that should be kept and one that should be filtered out.

```sql
CREATE TABLE event_log (
    case_id VARCHAR,
    activity VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO event_log (case_id, activity, timestamp) VALUES
-- Case 'A' has 3 events (should be INCLUDED)
('A', 'Start', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
('A', 'Activity 1', '2023-01-01 10:05:00'),
('A', 'End', '2023-01-01 10:10:00'),

-- Case 'B' has 7 events (should be EXCLUDED)
('B', 'Start', '2023-01-02 11:00:00'),
('B', 'Activity 1', '2023-01-02 11:01:00'),
('B', 'Activity 2', '2023-01-02 11:02:00'),
('B', 'Activity 3', '2023-01-02 11:03:00'),
('B', 'Activity 4', '2023-01-02 11:04:00'),
('B', 'Activity 5', '2023-01-02 11:05:00'),
('B', 'End', '2023-01-02 11:06:00'),

-- Case 'C' has 6 events (should be INCLUDED)
('C', 'Start', '2023-01-03 09:00:00'),
('C', 'Activity X', '2023-01-03 09:10:00'),
('C', 'Activity Y', '2023-01-03 09:20:00'),
('C', 'Activity Z', '2023-01-03 09:30:00'),
('C', 'Wait', '2023-01-03 09:40:00'),
('C', 'End', '2023-01-03 09:50:00');
```

**Expected Output:**
Based on the sample data above, your query should produce the following result. The order of rows does not matter, but all 9 rows corresponding to `case_id` 'A' and 'C' must be present.

| case_id | activity   | timestamp           |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| A       | Start      | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 |
| A       | Activity 1 | 2023-01-01 10:05:00 |
| A       | End        | 2023-01-01 10:10:00 |
| C       | Start      | 2023-01-03 09:00:00 |
| C       | Activity X | 2023-01-03 09:10:00 |
| C       | Activity Y | 2023-01-03 09:20:00 |
| C       | Activity Z | 2023-01-03 09:30:00 |
| C       | Wait       | 2023-01-03 09:40:00 |
| C       | End        | 2023-01-03 09:50:00 |

### Critique of Your Original Draft:

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Clear Goal:** The objective was stated very clearly and rephrased for reinforcement.
    *   **Correct Terminology:** Using "case_id," "event log," and "process instance" set the context perfectly.
    *   **Identified Core Logic:** You correctly pointed to "grouping and filtering" as the key skills needed.

*   **Why the Revised Version is Stronger for a Benchmark:**
    *   **Unambiguous:** The `CREATE`/`INSERT` statements and the `Expected Output` table remove any possible misinterpretation of the requirements. The model's output can be directly compared against a single "source of truth."
    *   **Testable:** Anyone (or any automated evaluation script) can run the setup SQL and then run the AI-generated query to see if it produces the correct result. This is the most critical feature of a high-quality benchmark.
    *   **Edge Case Inclusion:** The sample data explicitly includes a case with *fewer than* six events and a case with *exactly* six events, confirming that the condition is `<= 6` and not just `< 6`. This tests for precision.
