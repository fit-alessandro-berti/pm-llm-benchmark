### **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**  
**Calculation of Waiting Times**  
Waiting time is defined as the time a patient spends in a queue between the *completion* of one activity and the *start* of the next, irrespective of resource availability. For example, if "Nurse Assessment" completes at 09:25:10 and "Doctor Consultation" starts at 09:45:55, the waiting time is **20 minutes 45 seconds**. This is derived directly from timestamps in the event log.  

**Key Metrics**  
- **Average Waiting Time**: Central tendency of delays between activities.  
- **Median Waiting Time**: Insensitive to outliers (e.g., one extremely long wait skewing averages).  
- **90th Percentile Waiting Time**: Timepoint where 90% of patients wait less (critical for identifying "worst-case" experiences).  
- **Queue Frequency**: How often a queue occurs (e.g., "registration to nurse" might occur in 95% of cases vs. "ECG to check-out" in 20%).  
- **Breach Rate**: % of cases exceeding a clinically defined tolerance (e.g., >30 minutes between nurse assessment and doctor consult).  

**Critical Queue Identification Criteria**  
A queue is flagged as critical if it meets **two or more** of:  
1. **High Impact**: Affects >70% of patients (e.g., "check-in to triage" queue).  
2. **Severe Delays**: 90th percentile waiting time >2× the service time of the subsequent activity (e.g., 45-minute wait for a 15-minute nurse assessment).  
3. **Urgency Disproportionality**: Waiting times for urgent patients are >1.5× longer than for non-urgent patients in the same queue.  

### **2. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Common Root Causes Identified via Process Mining**  
- **Resource Bottlenecks**:  
  - *Example*: Nurses take 25–40 minutes for assessments, but only 3 nurses are available during peak hours (10 AM–12 PM). Queue mining reveals 80% of cases wait >20 minutes here.  
  - *Data Support*: Resource utilization heatmaps showing 120% capacity for Nurses 1–3 during peaks.  

- **Activity Dependency Constraints**:  
  - *Example*: Doctor consults can only start after nurse assessments, but no parallel processing for blood tests (which could overlap with nurse steps).  
  - *Data Support*: Variant analysis shows 60% of cases follow the "Nurse  Doctor  ECG" path, creating a funnel effect.  

- **Variability in Service Times**:  
  - *Example*: Cardiology doctors have a service time standard deviation of 18 minutes (range 12–45 mins), causing unpredictable downstream waits.  
  - *Data Support*: Time-series plots showing "Doctor Consultation" activity durations lack control limits.  

- **Scheduling Inefficiencies**:  
  - *Example*: 40% of urgent patients are scheduled during non-urgent hours, leading to misprioritization at triage.  
  - *Data Support*: Arrival pattern analysis showing 70% of urgent patients arrive within 30 minutes of a new patient clinic opening.  

**Analytical Techniques Used**  
- **Resource Bottleneck Analysis**: Identifies resources with >90% utilization during 50%+ of cases.  
- **Variant Analysis**: Compares pathways (e.g., "New vs. Follow-up") to isolate delays specific to patient types.  
- **Service Time Tolerance Bands**: Flags activities where 30%+ of cases exceed a clinically acceptable duration (e.g., >15 mins for blood draws).  

### **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**  
**Strategy 1: Dynamic Nurse Allocation + Pre-Consultation Blood Draws**  
- **Targets**:  
  - *Critical Queue*: "Nurse Assessment"  "Doctor Consultation" (avg. wait: 22 min, 90th percentile: 45 min).  
  - *Root Cause*: Nurse understaffing and sequential dependency on blood tests.  
- **Action**:  
  - Deploy 2 additional nurses during peak hours (10 AM–12 PM) and allow blood draws to occur concurrently with nurse assessments for non-urgent cases.  
- **Data Justification**:  
  - 65% of blood draws take <15 mins and could overlap without compromising care.  
  - Nurse capacity increases from 3 to 5 during peaks, reducing utilization to 85%.  
- **Impact**:  
  - Expected 35% reduction in "Nurse  Doctor" wait time (avg. wait drops to ~14 min).  
  - 15% faster overall visit duration.  

**Strategy 2: Urgent Patient Fast-Track Workflow**  
- **Targets**:  
  - *Critical Queue*: "Registration"  "Urgent Triage" (urgency breach rate: 68%).  
  - *Root Cause*: Urgent patients wait in generic registration queues.  
- **Action**:  
  - Implement a 2-minute digital triage at registration kiosks to immediately flag urgent cases, routing them to a dedicated triage nurse and freeing up clerk time.  
- **Data Justification**:  
  - 30% of urgent patients currently wait >25 mins in registration due to clerks not prioritizing them.  
  - Pilot analysis shows digital triage reduces triage wait time by 40% (from 18 to 11 mins).  
- **Impact**:  
  - Urgent patients’ "Registration  Triage" wait time decreases by 50% (avg. 10 min  5 min).  
  - 25% reduction in walk-off (patient abandonment) for urgent cases.  

**Strategy 3: Room-Type Specialization + Appointment Bundling**  
- **Targets**:  
  - *Critical Queue*: "ECG Test"  "Check-Out" (avg. wait: 28 min due to lab  front desk handoff).  
  - *Root Cause*: ECG rooms are shared with non-urgent tests, causing conflicts.  
- **Action**:  
  - Designate 1 room as "ECG-only" during AM hours and bundle ECG appointments with follow-up consults to reduce check-out dependency.  
- **Data Justification**:  
  - ECG tests take 12 mins but are delayed by 50% due to room sharing. Dedicated rooms would cut delays to 5 mins.  
  - 25% of follow-up patients require ECGs; bundling reduces redundant check-out steps.  
- **Impact**:  
  - "ECG  Check-Out" wait time drops by 55% (avg. 13 min).  
  - 10% cost savings from reduced front-desk staffing needs.  

### **4. Trade-offs and Constraints**  
**Potential Risks**  
- *Strategy 1*: Additional nurses increase payroll costs by ~$120k/year. If not offset by visit volume growth (from improved satisfaction), net savings may not materialize.  
- *Strategy 2*: Digital triage requires $15k in kiosk upgrades and 20 hours of staff training, with ~3-month payoff period.  
- *Strategy 3*: Room specialization reduces flexibility; urgent ECGs could face delays if the dedicated room is occupied (mitigated by surge capacity planning).  

**Balancing Objectives**  
- **Cost vs. Quality**: Use incremental implementation (e.g., hire nurses part-time initially) and monitor clinical outcomes (e.g., % of ECGs completed within 24 hours).  
- **Wait Time vs. Staff Burden**: Rotate relief nurses to prevent burnout and track overtime costs as KPIs.  
- **Urgency vs. Fairness**: Ensure fast-track workflows don’t disadvantage non-urgent patients; maintain SLAs (e.g., non-urgent patients still wait <15 mins).  

### **5. Measuring Success**  
**KPIs**  
1. **Primary**:  
   - Average waiting time between critical activities (target: <20 mins).  
   - 90th percentile waiting time for urgent patients (target: <25 mins).  
2. **Secondary**:  
   - Total visit duration (target: reduce by 20%).  
   - % of cases breaching wait thresholds (target: <15%).  
   - Resource utilization rates (target: nurses <90%, rooms <85%).  

**Ongoing Monitoring**  
- **Process Mining Dashboards**:  
  - Real-time Gantt charts tracking current queues (e.g., "Doctor Consultation" backlog).  
  - Automated alerts for queues exceeding 90th percentile thresholds.  
- **Patient Experience Integration**:  
  - Link wait times to post-visit survey data (e.g., "wait satisfaction" scores against wait metrics).  
- **Monthly Variant Performance Reports**:  
  - Compare optimized pathways (e.g., "Fast-Track Urgent") to legacy pathways.  

**Example Success Scenario**  
After 6 months:  
- "Nurse  Doctor" wait time drops from 22 to 14 mins (**36% reduction**).  
- Urgent patients’ total visit duration decreases by 18%, reducing no-shows by 12%.  
- ECG room utilization improves from 78% to 93%, with no increase in test backlog.

### **Implementation Roadmap**  
1. **Phase 1 (0–3 Months)**: Pilot digital triage and ECG room specialization.  
2. **Phase 2 (3–6 Months)**: Roll out dynamic nurse staffing and blood draw parallelization.  
3. **Phase 3 (6–12 Months)**: Expand.fast-track workflows to other specialties (e.g., dermatology).  

This approach balances operational changes with measurable, patient-centric outcomes while mitigating risks through phased execution and data validation.
