Below is a complete DuckDB SQL solution that fulfills all the requirements of the prompt. It is structured using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for clarity and modularity.

### Explanation of the Approach

The query is broken down into four logical steps, each implemented as a Common Table Expression (CTE):

1.  **`case_variants`**: This CTE first groups the `event_log` by `case_id`. For each case, it uses the `list_agg` aggregate function. The `ORDER BY timestamp` clause within the function is crucial as it ensures the activities are assembled into a list in the correct chronological order, thus creating the process variant.
2.  **`variant_counts`**: This CTE takes the output from `case_variants` (one row per case with its variant) and groups by the `variant` itself. It then counts the number of cases (`COUNT(case_id)`) for each unique variant, calculating its frequency.
3.  **`top_k_variants`**: This CTE identifies the most frequent variants. It selects from `variant_counts`, orders the results by frequency in descending order (`ORDER BY frequency DESC`), and uses `LIMIT 3` to select the top 3. You can change `3` to any integer `K`.
4.  **Final `SELECT` Statement**: The final step is to retrieve the original event data.
    *   It starts by selecting the `case_id`s that correspond to the top variants. This is done by joining `case_variants` (which maps `case_id` to its `variant`) with `top_k_variants` (which contains the list of top variant sequences).
    *   It then uses this list of `case_id`s in a `WHERE case_id IN (...)` clause to filter the original `event_log` table.
    *   The final result is all event rows from the original table that belong to cases following one of the top K variants, ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for readability.

### DuckDB SQL Query

This query is ready to be executed in a DuckDB environment where the `event_log` table exists. The value for `K` is set to `3` but can be easily adjusted.

```sql
-- Set the value of K for the top K variants
-- For this example, we will find the top 3 most frequent variants.
-- In a real application, this could be a parameter. Let's use a CTE for it.
WITH config AS (
    SELECT 3 AS k_value
),

-- Step 1: Determine the ordered sequence of activities (variant) for each case.
-- The list_agg function with an ORDER BY clause creates an ordered array of activities.
case_variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        list_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),

-- Step 2: Count the occurrences of each unique process variant.
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant,
        COUNT(case_id) AS frequency
    FROM
        case_variants
    GROUP BY
        variant
),

-- Step 3: Identify the top K variants by frequency.
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant
    FROM
        variant_counts
    ORDER BY
        frequency DESC
    LIMIT (SELECT k_value FROM config)
)

-- Step 4: Return all original events from cases that belong to the top K variants.
-- We select case_id's from case_variants whose variant is in our top_k_variants list,
-- and then use those case_id's to filter the original event_log.
SELECT
    log.*
FROM
    event_log AS log
WHERE
    log.case_id IN (
        SELECT
            cv.case_id
        FROM
            case_variants AS cv
        JOIN
            top_k_variants AS tkv ON cv.variant = tkv.variant
    )
ORDER BY
    log.case_id,
    log.timestamp;
```
