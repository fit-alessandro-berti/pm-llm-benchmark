Looking at this order fulfillment process, I'll construct a Log Skeleton based on the typical workflow constraints:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),  # Every order must be checked for availability
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),  # Shipping label always accompanies dispatch
    },
    
    'always_before': {
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment'),
        ('Receive Order', 'Dispatch'),  # Must receive before dispatching
        ('Pick Items', 'Invoice Customer'),  # Must pick before invoicing
    },
    
    'always_after': {
        ('Reserve Items', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Record Payment', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Pick Items'),  # Invoicing happens after picking
    },
    
    'never_together': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Dispatch'),  # Can't receive and dispatch simultaneously
        ('Check Availability', 'Record Payment'),  # Availability check and payment recording are temporally separate
    },
    
    'activ_freq': {
        'Receive Order': {1},           # Each case has exactly one order receipt
        'Check Availability': {1},      # Each order is checked once
        'Reserve Items': {1},           # Items reserved once per order
        'Pick Items': {1, 2, 3},        # May require multiple picking rounds
        'Quality Check': {1, 2},        # May need re-check if issues found
        'Pack Order': {1},              # Packed once per order
        'Generate Shipping Label': {1}, # One label per shipment
        'Dispatch': {1},                # Dispatched once
        'Invoice Customer': {1},        # One invoice per order
        'Record Payment': {0, 1},       # Payment may or may not be recorded in same case
    },
    
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),     # Immediately check availability
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),             # Start picking after reservation
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),   # Label immediately after packing
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),     # Dispatch immediately after labeling
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment'),      # Record payment right after invoicing if payment occurs
    }
}
```

**Key reasoning for the constraints:**

1. **Equivalence**: RO and CA are equivalent because every received order must be checked. GSL and D are equivalent because shipping labels are created specifically for dispatch.

2. **Always Before/After**: These enforce the sequential nature of the process - you can't pick before reserving, can't pack before quality check, etc.

3. **Never Together**: RO and D cannot happen together since they're at opposite ends of the process timeline.

4. **Activity Occurrences**: 
   - Most activities occur exactly once per order
   - Pick Items can occur multiple times (for large orders)
   - Quality Check might need repetition if issues are found
   - Record Payment might be 0 if payment processing happens in a separate system/case

5. **Directly-Follows**: Critical immediate sequences in the workflow where one activity directly triggers the next.

This Log Skeleton captures the essential declarative constraints of the order fulfillment process while allowing some flexibility in execution paths.
