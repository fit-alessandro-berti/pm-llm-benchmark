Certainly! Let’s break down the pseudo-BPMN process into clear, detailed steps, explaining the business logic, purpose of each activity, the function of gateways, and how process flows diverge, converge, or loop. I’ll also highlight the differences between standard vs. custom requests and approval/rework triggers.

---

## **1. Process Overview**

This process diagram models how a company handles customer requests, accommodating both standard and custom orders. It ensures validation, checks, feasibility analysis, necessary approvals, and communicates the outcome to the customer.

---

## **2. Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **(A) Start Event**
- **Purpose:** Marks the initiation—the moment a customer request is received.

---

### **(B) Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose:** The business receives and logs a new request from a customer, capturing initial requirements.

---

### **(C) Gateway (XOR) - "Check Request Type"**
- **Meaning:** An exclusive OR (XOR) gateway—only one outgoing path is chosen based on the type of request.
- **How:** The process checks if this is a "Standard" or "Custom" request and routes accordingly.

---

#### **Path 1: [Type = Standard]**

#### **(D1) Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
- **Purpose:** Checks for completeness, correctness, and eligibility of a standard order (e.g., ensuring items exist, details are valid).

#### **(D2) Gateway (AND) - "Run Parallel Checks"**
- **Meaning:** Parallel (AND) gateway—initiates simultaneous tasks.
- **How:** Both the Credit Check and Inventory Check occur at the same time, speeding up the process.

##### **(E1) Task C1: "Credit Check"**
- **Purpose:** Confirms customer’s creditworthiness (e.g., within payment terms, sufficient balance).

##### **(E2) Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
- **Purpose:** Ensures requested products are available in inventory.

#### **(D3) All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
- **Meaning:** Synchronization point—the process waits until both checks are done before moving on.

#### **(D4) Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
- **Purpose:** Based on order specifics, credit, and stock, determines when the delivery can occur.

---

#### **Path 2: [Type = Custom]**

#### **(F1) Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
- **Purpose:** In-depth review to determine if the company can fulfill special customer specifications (resource check, capability, profitability).

#### **(F2) Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
- **Meaning:** Depending on analysis, one path is taken.
- **[If Yes]**: Proceed with quotation.
- **[If No]**: Reject and terminate process.

##### **(G1) Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
- **Purpose:** If feasible, prepare a tailored offer specifying price, feasibility, and timeline.

##### **(G2) Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
- **Purpose:** If not feasible, inform the customer (Process ends here for rejected custom requests).

---

### **(H) After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed**
Once key tasks are complete on either the standard (Task D) or custom (Task E1) path:

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
- **Meaning:** Checks if managerial approval is required (often applies for high-value, risk, or custom orders).
- **How:** If needed, initiate approval; otherwise, proceed.

##### **[If Yes] Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
- **Purpose:** Route request to the appropriate manager for review and authorization.

###### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
- **[If Yes] Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
    - **Purpose:** According to approved terms, prepare the final invoice for billing.
- **[If No] Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
    - **Purpose:** The process needs to reconsider details due to denied approval.
    - **Loop-back logic:**
        - **Custom Path:** Returns to Task E1 ("Prepare Custom Quotation") for possible adjustment and resubmission.
        - **Standard Path:** Returns to Task D ("Calculate Delivery Date") for possible changes/negotiation and resubmission.

##### **[If No Approval Needed] Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
- **Purpose:** If no approval is required, generate the invoice directly.

---

### **(I) Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- **Purpose:** Notifies customer of their order status, order confirmation/invoice, closing the interaction.

---

### **(J) End Event**
- **Purpose:** Signifies successful process completion (or, in case of custom request rejection, premature ending).

---

## **3. Key Gateways and Flow Control**

- **XOR Gateways:** Used to select mutually exclusive paths (e.g., standard vs. custom; feasibility; approval outcomes).
- **AND Gateway:** Used to launch parallel activities (e.g., credit and inventory checks), followed by a join to synchronize.
- **Loops:** Upon management rejection, process returns to relevant tasks (rework)—either revising the custom quote (E1) or recalculating delivery (D) before resubmitting for approval.

---

## **4. Standard vs. Custom Requests**

### **Standard:**
- Straightforward checks (validation, credit, stock).
- Faster processing—most likely to require approval only for high-value or risk scenarios.
- Delivery date can be calculated immediately post-validation and checks.

### **Custom:**
- Requires a feasibility analysis.
- May result in immediate rejection if not viable.
- Prepares a bespoke quotation.
- Approval may be more commonly required for custom solutions, and rework is tailored accordingly.

---

## **5. Approvals and Rework Loops**

- **Approval Trigger:** Approvals are required per company policy (e.g., order value, risk profile, customization).
- **If Not Approved:** The process isn’t abandoned—details are reviewed and refined, and the approval is resought. Custom orders loop to modifying the quotation; standard ones may need to adjust delivery terms or conditions.

---

## **6. Endings**

1. **Normal End:** After confirmation is sent post-invoice.
2. **Custom Rejection End:** If customization is not feasible, customer receives a rejection notice, process terminates.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step | Standard | Custom | Approval? | Rework/Loop? | End? |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|--------------|------|
| Initial | A, B1 | A, B2 | Possible | Possible | No |
| Parallel Checks | C1+C2 | - | - | - | - |
| Calculation/Quotation | D | E1 | Possibly after | If not approved | - |
| Approval | Possible | Likely | Yes | Yes | - |
| Rework | D | E1 | As needed | Until approval | - |
| Final | G  I | G  I | No more | No | Yes |

---

**In essence:**  
The process efficiently handles both standard and custom customer requests, ensuring all necessary checks, validations, and approvals are completed. Parallelism accelerates standard orders; custom work introduces more conditional and potentially terminating logic. Approval mechanisms and rework loops ensure compliance and customer satisfaction before finalized invoicing and confirmation.
