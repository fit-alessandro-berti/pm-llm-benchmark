**Labeled Activity Breakdown and Rationale**

To analyze the event log, we'll follow the steps:

---

### **Phase 1: Idle / Initialization**
**Events:** 1–3  
**Sensor Pattern:**
- Low temperature (~20–21°C)
- Zero vibration
- Zero material flow
- Zero or minimal tool movement
- Low energy consumption (0.40–0.50 kWh)

**Assigned Label:** **Idle / Machine Initialization**

**Rationale:**
The machine is powered on but not performing any work. All activity sensors are near static or at zero. This is consistent with idle states before a task begins.

---

### **Phase 2: Cutting Metal**
**Events:** 4–6  
**Sensor Pattern:**
- Rapid increase in temperature (50  58°C)
- Moderate increase in pressure (1  1.5 bar)
- High vibration (30  38 Hz)
- High material flow rate (steady at 5 units/s)
- Progressive tool movement (position from 5  10 mm)
- Elevating energy usage (2.00  3.00 kWh)

**Assigned Label:** **Cutting Metal**

**Rationale:**
Cutting operations typically involve high-speed movement and contact with material, generating heat and vibration. The steady high flow rate could represent coolant or chip removal. Tool is advancing, and energy consumption is rising correspondingly.

---

### **Phase 3: Assembling Parts**
**Events:** 7–8  
**Sensor Pattern:**
- Temperature stabilizes (~40°C)
- Pressure increases (2 bar)
- Vibration drops to 10 Hz
- Material flow reduces to 2 units/s
- Tool maintains position at 15 mm
- Stable energy (2.00 kWh)

**Assigned Label:** **Assembling Parts**

**Rationale:**
Assembling often involves moderate energy use, reduced vibration compared to cutting, and positioning of components. Material flow may represent adhesives or assembly materials. The tool is holding position, indicating fixation rather than cutting.

---

### **Phase 4: Welding**
**Event:** 9  
**Sensor Pattern:**
- Sharp spike in temperature (80°C)
- High vibration (50 Hz)
- Material flow drops to 0
- Tool position constant (15 mm)
- Energy surges (5.00 kWh)

**Assigned Label:** **Welding**

**Rationale:**
Welding typically causes sharp temperature increases and requires high energy. The drop in material flow supports this (no external material needed). Tool stays steady while welding at a position, and vibration peaks due to arc instability or electrode movement.

---

### **Phase 5: Quality Inspection**
**Events:** 10–12  
**Sensor Pattern:**
- Temperature decreases (30  25°C)
- Low and stable vibration (1  5 Hz)
- Minimal material flow (0  1 unit/s)
- Tool advancing from 15  20 mm
- Moderate energy use (1.00  1.60 kWh)

**Assigned Label:** **Quality Inspection**

**Rationale:**
During inspection, tools may move slightly over the parts, temperature cools, and sensors like cameras or probes use minimal power/vibration. Slight tool movement and increasing energy suggest scanning or touch-probing.

---

### **Phase 6: Packaging / Final Idle**
**Events:** 13–15  
**Sensor Pattern:**
- Return to low temperatures (~20–21°C)
- Pressure and vibration zeroed
- No material flow or tool movement
- Low energy (~0.45 kWh)

**Assigned Label:** **Packaging / Final Idle**

**Rationale:**
This phase could either represent return to an idle state or the system passively involved in a non-intensive concluding process like packaging. Since there’s no movement or flow, we can conservatively classify it as returning to idle or awaiting next operation.

| Events      | Activity               | Rationale Summary                                                                 |

| 1–3         | Idle / Initialization  | All readings near baseline; machine is on but not active                          |
| 4–6         | Cutting Metal          | High temperature, vibration, material flow, and progressing tool movement         |
| 7–8         | Assembling Parts       | Moderate readings, stable tool position, reduced vibration                        |
| 9           | Welding                | Spike in energy and temperature with high vibration and stationary tool           |
| 10–12       | Quality Inspection     | Low/moderate activity, moderate tool probing, slight shift in readings            |
| 13–15       | Packaging / Final Idle | Return to baseline values; likely not performing active manufacturing             |
