**Explanation:**

* **Equivalence:** Only Receive Order and Check Availability should have the same number of occurrences. 
* **Always Before:**  Activities are listed in a logical order.  For example, Check Availability must precede Reserve Items. 
* **Always After:**  Not applicable in this scenario since the order is inherently sequential. 
* **Never Together:** Not applicable in this scenario as activities flow linearly. 
* **Activity Occurrences:** Each activity should occur only once in a single order fulfillment process.
* **Directly Follows:**  Activities are directly chained together where one immediately follows the other.

**Note:**  This Log Skeleton captures the ideal order fulfillment process. In reality, there could be variations (e.g., exceptions, errors) that might not conform to these strict rules.
