Based on the detailed process you’ve described, I have categorized several targeted questions to help bridge the gaps in my understanding of the workflow, decision logic, and potential bottlenecks.

### 1. Clarifying Roles and Responsibilities
*   **Decision Authority:** When a property manager is being assigned, who makes the final decision? Is there a centralized resource manager, or is it a collaborative decision among regional office heads?
*   **Third-Party Management:** Regarding the photographers and inspectors: Does the company have a pre-approved vendor list, or is the property manager responsible for sourcing these individuals locally for every new property?
*   **Tenant Selection:** Who has the final "veto" power on a prospective tenant—the property manager or the landlord?

### 2. Understanding Decision Criteria and Logic
*   **Assignment Weighting:** You mentioned several factors for assigning property managers (workload, geography, etc.). Is there a specific hierarchy or "score" used to weight these factors if they conflict (e.g., if the most experienced manager is also the one with the highest workload)?
*   **Pricing Models:** How frequently are the "internal pricing models" updated, and what specific external data points (e.g., competitor rates, seasonal trends) are prioritized when setting the initial rental range?
*   **Tenant Prioritization:** When multiple suitable tenants apply, you mentioned negotiating terms. Are there standardized "tie-breaker" criteria (e.g., credit score threshold vs. lease length) to ensure the selection process remains objective and compliant?

### 3. Timing, Sequencing, and Parallelism
*   **Concurrent Tasks:** Can the digital marketing team begin creating listings while the property is undergoing repairs, or must the property pass the final inspection before *any* marketing activities commence?
*   **The "Onboarding Clock":** From the moment a landlord first contacts the regional office, what is the target "Lead-to-Live" duration? Which stage currently acts as the most common bottleneck in this timeline?
*   **Post-Lease Audits:** Do the quality checks by the compliance officer and financial analyst happen *before* the tenant signs the lease (as a gatekeeper) or *after* the lease is signed (as a retrospective audit)?

### 4. Handling Exceptions and Risks
*   **Compliance Failure:** What is the protocol if a property consistently fails inspection or if a landlord refuses to perform the necessary repairs? At what point does the company decide to decline the property?
*   **Custom Clause Protocol:** When a landlord insists on custom lease clauses, does this trigger an automatic legal review, or does the property manager have the discretion to approve standard deviations?
*   **Data Discrepancies:** If the IT department or a financial analyst finds an error during the final audit (e.g., the rental price in the system doesn't match the signed lease), what is the "rollback" or correction procedure?

### 5. Communication and Information Flow
*   **Information Handoffs:** How is the "knowledge" gathered by the Property Coordinator (during the document review phase) transferred to the Property Manager to ensure they are fully briefed before meeting the landlord?
*   **Stakeholder Visibility:** Does the landlord have visibility into this onboarding pipeline (e.g., a portal), or is all communication pushed manually via email and calls by the property manager?
*   **System Integration:** You mentioned using a combination of CRMs and project management tools. Is there a "single source of truth" for the property status, or do teams have to check multiple systems to see where a property stands in the onboarding lifecycle?
