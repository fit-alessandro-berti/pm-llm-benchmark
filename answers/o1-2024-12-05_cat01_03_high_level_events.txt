Below is an illustrative example of how the low-level events can be aggregated into higher-level process steps, along with an explanation of the logic behind each grouping. The names chosen for these high-level activities are domain-relevant and reflect distinct stages in the manufacturing workflow.

### Proposed High-Level Activities

1. **Material Preparation & Setup**
2. **Welding Assembly**
3. **Coating Application**
4. **Final Quality Assurance**

### Detailed Groupings and Rationales

**High-Level Activity 1: Material Preparation & Setup**  
- **Included Low-Level Events (for Case A1):**  
  - Retrieve raw metal sheet (Operator A)  
  - Scan barcode (Operator A)  
  - Place metal sheet on table (Operator A)  
  - Align metal sheet (Robot Arm #2)  
  - Preheat metal sheet (Heating Unit #1)

- **Rationale:**  
  These actions all occur at the start of the process and are focused on preparing the raw material so it’s ready for assembly. The events form a natural, chronological cluster from the moment the raw material is retrieved and identified (via barcode scan) to when it is properly aligned and brought to the correct temperature. Taken together, these steps represent the foundational setup work needed before any assembly operations can begin.

**High-Level Activity 2: Welding Assembly**  
- **Included Low-Level Events (for Case A1):**  
  - Pick up welding tool (Operator B)  
  - Weld corner A (Operator B)  
  - Weld corner B (Operator B)  
  - Measure weld integrity (Quality Sensor #1)

- **Rationale:**  
  After preparation, the process transitions into the assembly phase, where the item is physically joined and secured. Events here are logically tied to the welding operation—first by acquiring the appropriate tool, then performing the welds, and immediately verifying their quality. The integrity measurement is grouped here because it directly assesses the success of the welding step and is part of ensuring the weld’s reliability before moving on.

**High-Level Activity 3: Coating Application**  
- **Included Low-Level Events (for Case A1):**  
  - Apply protective coating (Coating Unit #3)  
  - Dry coating (Heating Unit #2)

- **Rationale:**  
  Once welding is complete and verified, the next logical step is to apply a protective finish. The application and subsequent drying of the coating form a distinct process phase that enhances the product’s durability and final finish. These events are closely connected in purpose (surface finishing) and occur sequentially, forming a clear standalone stage.

**High-Level Activity 4: Final Quality Assurance**  
- **Included Low-Level Event (for Case A1):**  
  - Visual check (Operator C)

- **Rationale:**  
  After all transformative steps are completed, the item undergoes a final quality check. This is a separate, high-level activity focused on verifying that the finished product meets overall standards and requirements. The visual inspection stands apart as the concluding step, ensuring that any imperfections not caught by earlier automated measurements are identified before the product moves on.

**Note:**  
The exact grouping and naming may be refined as more domain knowledge or event data becomes available. However, this structure provides a meaningful, stage-based abstraction that consolidates granular machine and operator events into clear, high-level manufacturing process steps.
