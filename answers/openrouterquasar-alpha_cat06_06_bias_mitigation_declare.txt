Certainly! Here is the updated DECLARE model with added constraints that mitigate decision bias related to sensitive attributes, accompanied by explanations.

### Updated DECLARE Model with Fairness Constraints

```python

### Rationale for the Added Constraints

- **Existence of `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview`**
  
  Guarantees that every trace involving sensitive attribute handling always includes explicit fairness checks (`BiasMitigationCheck`) and additional human oversight (`ManualReview`).

- **Coexistence Constraints**

  E.g.,  
  `"Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {...}}`  
  `"Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {...}}`  
  
  Force any approval or rejection involving sensitive applicant groups (such as minorities or sensitive age categories) to always coexist with a `ManualReview` step, promoting consistency and careful examination across these decisions.

- **Response Constraints from Sensitive Attribute Checks**

  E.g.,  
  `"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {...}}`  
  
  Enforce that after sensitive information is obtained, a bias mitigation step must always follow before moving to any decision. This requirement inserts a fairness checkpoint into the process.

- **Succession from `BiasMitigationCheck` to Final Decision**

  Ensures that after fairness checks, the process proceeds to decision-making, maintaining process flow structure while imposing fairness controls.

- **Non-Succession and Non-Chain-Succession Constraints**

  Prevent any immediate or direct transition from sensitive attribute checks (`CheckApplicantRace`, etc.) to a final decision, disallowing potentially biased snap decisions made right after sensitive data is seen but before the bias check occurs.

### How the Constraints Reduce Bias

These added rules enforce that decisions affecting sensitive applicant groups:

- Are always supervised by a **manual review**, increasing transparency and accountability.
- Must be preceded by a **BiasMitigationCheck** after sensitive attributes are considered, thereby embedding fairness verification within the workflow.
- Cannot be made immediately after sensitive data is seen, **averting rash, possibly biased decisions**.
- Embed essential fairness checks into every process path involving sensitive information, promoting more equitable outcomes across demographic groups.

This design structurally reduces opportunities for unfair, discriminatory decision-making and increases the process's robustness against bias.

This approach can be extended with additional constraints tailored to other sensitive attributes or fairness considerations as needed.
