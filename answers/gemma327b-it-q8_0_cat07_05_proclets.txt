Here's a description of the visualization provided, breaking it down piece by piece:

**Overall Structure & Style**

The visualization utilizes a sort of diagramming technique that combines elements of State Diagrams or Activity Diagrams, and Class Diagrams or something that is representing workflows in a business context. The look suggests it's designed for modeling some health information system (HIS) or patient pathway. It looks like a business process model or a very specific visual software architecture. 

   **Elements**
 * **States/Activities:** Represented as rounded rectangles, outlining a stage in the described process. (e.g., “Order entry,” "Lab test," "Judge results", "Perform test).
 * **Actors/Agents:** Oval Shapes representing the personnel/involved roles participating in the process. (eg "laboratory assistant, doctor", "chemical analyst,).
 * **Transitions/Flow:**  Gray Arrows show that steps move from one State to another or one to the other in the workflow
* Rectangles show the details of the transition with the notation (1.1),(1.7). Meaning 
* **Classes/Boxes:** Represent “proclot classes” which is a notation used with business processes/ UML diagramming
* The bottom-most element shows a **Performative Table** showing time, channel, sender, receiver, message and the action happening in that process.

**Breakdown per sub-graphic:**

*   **Part (a): “Two proclet classes connected through two channels”:** This diagram appears is representing a Workflow. It portrays several Actors working together in a set of States. Here in part (a), both of the actors have a set of State that can lead to each other given certain circumstances. The Arrows connecting Actors with State indicate the information they send from One Step to another, which could be via Electronic channels.

*   **Part (b) “Class diagram containing the Two Proclot Classes.”:** The Classes in Part (b) are showing 1-to-1 type of relationship. "Lab test" requires “Lab Visit” and "Lab test can be taken during/within LabVisit"

*  **Part (c) “Example of a Performative.”** shows real messages that happen in a Workflow by specifying which Channel it is, who the sender and receiver are to the action.  It’s almost like a “message table”, a specific sample workflow for a time (“11.00”) with the relevant actions taken by each person involved in the Workflow (in this case “creating tests for John”).

In summary, this Visualization depicts a Model of a Health System’s processes for Lab Visits and Lab testing from Start to Completion via a series of Actors connected through specific Workflow procedures to provide quality services via electronic means.
