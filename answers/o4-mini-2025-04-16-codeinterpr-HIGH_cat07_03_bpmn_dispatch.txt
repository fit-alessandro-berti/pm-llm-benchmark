This is a BPMN-style swimlane diagram that models the “Ship goods” process in a small computer-hardware shop.  It is divided into three horizontal lanes (from top to bottom):  

 1. Logistics  
 2. Dispatch of goods / Secretary  
 3. Warehouse  

At the far left you see the Start Event (“Ship goods” circle) in the Secretary lane.  Immediately after the start there is a parallel (AND) gateway that splits the process into two concurrent threads:

• Upper branch (Secretary & Logistics) – arranging the carrier, label and insurance  
• Lower branch (Warehouse) – physically packaging the goods  

—————————————————————————————————————  
Upper branch (Secretary & Logistics):  
1. Task “Clarify shipment method” (Secretary)  
2. Exclusive (XOR) gateway “Special handling?”  
   • If YES (special handling required):  
     a. “Get 3 offers from logistic companies”  
     b. “Select logistic company and place order”  
   • If NO (ordinary shipment):  
     a. Task “Check if insurance is required” (Secretary), which reads from the “Customer information” data store  
     b. Exclusive gateway “If insurance necessary”  
        – One outgoing path (always): “Write package label” (Secretary)  
        – Conditional path (if insurance is required): “Insure parcel” (Logistics)  
3. The two label/insurance tasks re-join at an AND-join gateway in the Logistics lane  
4. From that join the process proceeds downward to meet the packaging branch  

————————————————————————————————————  
Lower branch (Warehouse):  
1. Task “Package goods”  
2. Attached to that task is an intermediate timer event (clock icon) set to 48 hours.  
   – If packaging is not completed within 48 h, the timer fires and the “Notify customer about delay” task is executed, then returns to “Package goods.”  
3. Once packaging is finished, this branch flows upward to the same AND-join gateway where it synchronizes with the label/insurance/carrier arrangements  

————————————————————————————————————  
After the AND-join (i.e. once both the upper and lower branches are complete):  
1. “Fill out Shipment paperwork” (Secretary)  
2. “Move package to pickup area” (Warehouse)  
3. End Event (“Shipment prepared”)  

Key modeling elements:  
• Start and end events (circles)  
• Tasks (rounded-corner rectangles)  
• Exclusive gateways (diamonds with an “X”) for decision points (“Special handling?”, insurance check)  
• Parallel gateways (diamonds with a “+”) to fork and join the packaging and logistics streams  
• Data object (“Order details”) feeding the Clarify task  
• Data store (“Customer information”) used for the insurance check  
• Intermediate timer event on the packaging task, with a looping notification for delays  

In plain English, it shows that as soon as an order is ready to ship, the warehouse begins packing while the secretary simultaneously sorts out shipment details (special handling vs. insurance vs. carrier).  Once both packing and paperwork are done, the package is moved to the pickup area and the shipment is complete.
