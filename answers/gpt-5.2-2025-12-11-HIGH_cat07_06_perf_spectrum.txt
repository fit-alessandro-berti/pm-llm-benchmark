The visualization is a time-based process/trace plot showing many individual cases moving through three activities:

- **Y-axis (activity lanes):** Three horizontal bands labeled on the right:
  1. **Send Fine** (top)
  2. **Insert Fine Notification** (middle)
  3. **Send for Credit Collection** (bottom)

- **X-axis (time):** A long time span from roughly **2000-01-25** on the left to **2013-04-24** on the right (timestamps shown along the bottom).

- **Traces/lines:** Numerous thin lines represent individual case trajectories:
  - A dense cluster of mostly **vertical grey lines** in the top band indicates many “Send Fine” events occurring throughout the period.
  - From the middle band down to the bottom band, many **diagonal, fan-shaped lines** show cases progressing over time from notification to credit collection (longer diagonals imply longer delays).
  - Some trajectories are highlighted in **red** (overlaid among the grey), likely emphasizing a subset of cases (e.g., selected, exceptional, or nonconforming cases).

Overall, it depicts how fines are issued, followed by notifications, and in some cases later escalated to credit collection, with timing and volume visible through line density and slope.
