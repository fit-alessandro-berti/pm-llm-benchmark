### Overview

The image outlines a **process model** for a medical workflow involving a patient's lab visit and subsequent lab testing. It uses formal notations, likely from the **procol language** (used for specifying interaction protocols). The visualization is broken into three main sections:

---

### (a) Two procol classes connected through two channels

#### **Entities and Roles:**
- **Lab visit** (left side): Involves a doctor, lab assistant, and the patient.
- **Lab test** (right side): Involves a chemical analyst.

#### **Workflow Steps:**
1. **Order entry:** The doctor or lab assistant enters an order via the "Order system."
2. **Take blood sample:** Lab assistant collects a sample.
3. **Order system communication:** A channel (dashed line) sends the order to the Lab test process.
4. **Perform test:** Chemical analyst performs the test.
5. **Make report:** Chemical analyst creates a report based on the test.
6. **Receive result:** Lab assistant receives the result via HIS (Hospital Information System).
7. **Judge results:** Lab assistant evaluates the results.
    - **If "Everything is fine":** Proceeds to "Send report."
    - **If not:** Repeats test ("Do tests again").
8. **Perform test again:** Chemical analyst may repeat the test and provide an updated report.
9. **Send report:** Final report is delivered.

#### **Channels:**
- **Order system**: Communicates test requests.
- **HIS**: Transmits results and updated reports.

### (b) Class diagram containing the two procol classes

- **Lab visit** requires one or more **Lab tests**.
- Association: Each lab visit must be connected to at least one lab test, and each lab test relates to a lab visit.

### (c) Example of a performative

A table provides an example message exchange:
- **Time:** 11:00
- **Channel:** Order system
- **Sender:** Lab visit – John
- **Receivers:** Lab test – HGB John
- **Action:** Create
- **Content:** "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
- **Scope:** Private
- **Direction:** OUT

This demonstrates how the communication and actions are logged formally.

### Summary

The image illustrates a typical interaction and data flow between a lab visit and laboratory testing in a healthcare setting, using formal procol notations and depicting:
- The roles and sequence of activities,
- The communication channels that transfer requests/results,
- The link between different classes of activities,
- A concrete example of a message exchanged within the process.

This helps formalize and clarify the workflow and interactions in a hospital lab testing scenario.
