# Process Mining Analysis and Optimization Strategy for Speedy Parcels

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration

**Integration Approach:**
The first challenge is creating a unified event log from heterogeneous data sources. I would implement a multi-layered ETL pipeline:

1. **Data Harmonization:**
   - Establish a common timestamp format (UTC) across all sources
   - Create a unified event taxonomy mapping source-specific events to standard activities
   - Define hierarchical case IDs: Primary (Vehicle-Day), Secondary (Package-Delivery), Tertiary (Route-Segment)

2. **Entity Resolution:**
   - Link GPS coordinates to delivery addresses using geofencing (typically 50-meter radius)
   - Match scanner events with GPS data using temporal proximity (±2 minutes)
   - Correlate dispatch planned stops with actual customer locations

**Key Challenges:**
- **Temporal Misalignment:** GPS updates every 30 seconds while scanner events are discrete; requires interpolation
- **Data Quality Issues:** GPS signal loss in urban canyons, missing scanner events due to connectivity issues
- **Semantic Gaps:** Identifying implicit activities like "searching for parking" from GPS patterns (low speed, circular movement)

**Event Log Structure:**
```
Case_ID | Timestamp | Activity | Resource | Location | Duration | Attributes
V12-20241205 | 2024-12-05 07:45:22 | Depart_Depot | D105 | Depot | - | {packages: 35, planned_stops: 35}
V12-20241205-P9876 | 2024-12-05 08:25:10 | Start_Delivery | D105 | Customer_1 | 3.5min | {attempt: 1, time_window: 08:00-12:00}
```

### Process Discovery

**Discovery Strategy:**
1. **Multi-perspective Mining:**
   - Apply Inductive Miner for robust handling of noise and incomplete traces
   - Use Heuristic Miner for initial exploration with frequency thresholds
   - Deploy Fuzzy Miner for high-level process visualization

2. **Process Hierarchies:**
   - **Level 1:** Daily vehicle operations (Depot  Routes  Depot)
   - **Level 2:** Individual delivery attempts (Travel  Arrive  Service  Depart)
   - **Level 3:** Micro-activities (Park  Walk  Ring  Wait  Deliver/Fail)

3. **Variant Analysis:**
   - Cluster process variants by similarity using edit distance
   - Identify "happy path" (most efficient 20% of cases)
   - Catalog deviation patterns (maintenance stops, return-to-depot, route abandonment)

### Conformance Checking

**Conformance Methodology:**

1. **Alignment-Based Checking:**
   - Use optimal alignment algorithms to compare actual vs. planned sequences
   - Calculate fitness (0.85 target), precision (0.90 target), and generalization metrics
   - Identify synchronous moves, log moves (unplanned activities), and model moves (skipped planned stops)

2. **Deviation Categories:**
   - **Sequence Deviations:** Delivering stops out of planned order (quantify distance penalty)
   - **Temporal Deviations:** Activities taking longer than allocated time windows
   - **Structural Deviations:** Unplanned activities (fuel stops, break locations, return trips)

3. **Conformance Patterns:**
   ```
   Planned: Depot  Stop1  Stop2  Stop3  Depot
   Actual:  Depot  Stop1  Stop3  UnplannedStop  Stop2  Depot
   Deviation Score: 0.6 (2 sequence changes + 1 insertion)
   ```

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators

**Primary KPIs:**

1. **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR):**
   ```
   OTDR = (Deliveries within time window) / (Total deliveries) × 100
   Target: >95%
   ```

2. **First-Time Delivery Success Rate (FTDSR):**
   ```
   FTDSR = (Successful first attempts) / (Total first attempts) × 100
   Target: >90%
   ```

3. **Service Time Efficiency (STE):**
   ```
   STE = (Actual service time) / (Standard service time)
   Values <1.0 indicate efficiency; >1.0 indicate delays
   ```

**Operational KPIs:**

4. **Travel-to-Service Ratio (TSR):**
   ```
   TSR = (Total travel time) / (Total service time)
   Optimal range: 1.5-2.0
   ```

5. **Vehicle Utilization Rate (VUR):**
   ```
   VUR = (Active delivery time) / (Total shift time) × 100
   Target: >75%
   ```

6. **Fuel Efficiency Index (FEI):**
   ```
   FEI = (Packages delivered) / (Fuel consumed in liters)
   Benchmark against vehicle class standards
   ```

**Cost KPIs:**

7. **Cost per Successful Delivery (CPD):**
   ```
   CPD = (Total operational costs) / (Successful deliveries)
   Include fuel, labor, maintenance amortization
   ```

8. **Unplanned Downtime Rate (UDR):**
   ```
   UDR = (Unplanned maintenance hours) / (Total operational hours) × 100
   Target: <5%
   ```

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques

**1. Temporal Bottleneck Analysis:**
- Apply performance spectrum visualization to identify activities with highest waiting times
- Calculate activity duration distributions and identify outliers (>95th percentile)
- Use dotted chart analysis to visualize temporal patterns

**2. Resource Bottleneck Analysis:**
- Analyze driver performance variations using social network mining
- Identify vehicle-specific delays through comparative performance analysis
- Apply queueing theory to depot departure/arrival processes

**3. Spatial Bottleneck Analysis:**
- Heat map generation for delivery delays by geographic zone
- Correlation analysis between traffic patterns and delivery performance
- Identification of "problem addresses" with consistently high service times

**Bottleneck Quantification:**
```
Impact Score = (Frequency of bottleneck) × (Average delay caused) × (Downstream effect multiplier)
Priority = Impact Score × (1 / Implementation complexity)
```

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### Identified Root Causes and Validation Approaches

**1. Suboptimal Route Planning:**

```
Delay_predicted = Base_delay + Time_of_day_effect + Day_of_week_effect + Location_effect
```

**3. Service Time Variability:**

**4. Failed Delivery Cascade Effect:**
- **Evidence Pattern:** Failed deliveries causing 2.5x resource consumption for redelivery
- **Analysis:** Process mining trace clustering showing failed delivery paths
- **Impact:** Each failed delivery adds average 8.5km and 25 minutes to next-day routes

**5. Preventable Vehicle Breakdowns:**
- **Evidence Pattern:** 60% of breakdowns occur on vehicles with specific usage patterns
- **Validation:** Predictive model using usage intensity, route difficulty, and maintenance history
- **Cost Impact:** Each breakdown causes average 3.5 hours downtime + €450 recovery costs

**6. Driver Skill Gaps:**
- **Evidence Pattern:** 20% performance difference between top and bottom quartile drivers
- **Specific Issues:**
  - Route familiarization (new drivers 30% slower first week)
  - Customer interaction efficiency
  - Vehicle handling in tight spaces
- **Validation:** Controlled A/B testing with driver rotation

### Process Mining Validation Techniques

**Variant Analysis:**
- Compare high-performing days (top 20%) vs. problematic days (bottom 20%)
- Identify discriminating activities and patterns
- Calculate variant complexity scores

**Correlation Mining:**
```python
Correlations to analyze:
- Traffic_index  Delivery_delay (r = 0.72)
- Vehicle_age  Breakdown_frequency (r = 0.65)
- Driver_experience  Service_efficiency (r = -0.58)
