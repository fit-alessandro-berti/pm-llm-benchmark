Based on the provided data, it appears you are describing a structured approval workflow or process. The key components and steps of this process can be broken down into the following workflow stages:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: This is the initial step where an employee initiates a declaration or task.

2. **Further Approval Steps**:
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**: The declaration then goes through an approval process by an administrative body or department.
   - **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**: In some cases, approval by a budget owner might be required, which indicates an additional level of financial oversight or clearance.
   - **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: The highest approval level in the process is the final supervisor's approval, indicating that the declaration or task has been verified and endorsed at the highest management level.

3. **Process Endpoints**:
   - **Request Payment**: This signifies that the approved declaration is ready for payment processing or action. It can correspond to obtaining resources, initiating financial transactions, or other monetarily related actions.
   - **Payment Handled**: This indicates that payment has been processed or completed.

4. **Variants in the Process**:
   - **Mutations and Alternations**: The data shows variations in how approvals might be handled, such as through multiple approvals such as the ADMINISTRATION  BUDGET OWNER  SUPERVISOR sequence, or through more complex, multilevel rejections and retries that might involve two rounds of approval processes (an approval and a rejection before final approval).
   - **Frequency and Performance**: The data likely reports the number of times each process variant is executed (frequency) and the performance metric (possibly time taken, financial cost, or efficiency metric), allowing for analysis on performance optimization and identifying bottlenecks.

5. **Special Cases**:
   - **Declaration REJECTED by various entities**: These indicate points where the declaration was not approved at certain stages, requiring reconsideration or revisions by the sender or subsequent submitter.
   - **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE**: This might represent a pause or storage rather than the progression of the process, allowing for the declaration to be revisited or altered before further processing.

In summary, the overarching process described involves an employee initiating a declaration which then goes through a series of approvals or validations, leading to its final approval and action points such as payment. The data likely serves to measure process efficiency, highlight potential inefficiencies, measure the effectiveness of different working stages, and inform process optimization
