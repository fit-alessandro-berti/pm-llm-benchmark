The provided **pseudo-BPMN** diagram represents a **customer request handling process** in a business context, such as a sales or service operation. It includes **conditional branching**, **parallel execution**, **looping**, and **converging paths**. Let's walk through the **business process** step by step, explaining the **purpose of each task**, the **meaning of the gateways**, and how **different paths converge or loop back**.

---

##  **Overview of the Business Process**

The process begins with **receiving a customer request**, which is then evaluated to determine whether it is **standard** or **custom**. Based on this classification, the process follows different paths to validate, analyze, and approve the request, ultimately leading to the **generation of a final invoice** and **confirmation to the customer**.

---

##  **Step-by-Step Explanation**

### 1. **Start Event**  
- **Purpose**: Initiates the process.
- **Trigger**: A customer submits a request (e.g., order, service request, or quote request).

---

### 2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**  
- **Purpose**: Captures the customer’s initial request.
- **Output**: A record of the request, including details like type, scope, and requirements.

---

### 3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**  
- **Purpose**: Determines whether the request is **standard** or **custom**.
- **Type**: **Exclusive Gateway** (XOR) — only one of the branches is taken.
- **Paths**:
  - **If Type = Standard**  Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"
  - **If Type = Custom**  Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"

---

### 4. **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation" (if Standard Request)**  
- **Purpose**: Validate the request using standard procedures and criteria.
- **Output**: Confirms that the request is within predefined parameters.

---

### 5. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**  
- **Purpose**: Execute multiple checks **in parallel** to validate the request.
- **Type**: **Parallel Gateway (AND)** — splits the process into two parallel paths.
- **Paths**:
  - **Task C1: "Credit Check"** — Evaluates customer creditworthiness.
  - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"** — Ensures inventory availability.

---

### 6. **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**  
- **Purpose**: Wait for **both** parallel tasks to complete before proceeding.
- **Type**: **Parallel Gateway (AND)** — merges the two parallel paths.
- **Output**: Confirms that both checks (credit and inventory) have passed.

---

### 7. **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**  
- **Purpose**: Determine the estimated delivery date based on the validated request.
- **Output**: A delivery date for the customer.

---

### 8. **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis" (if Custom Request)**  
- **Purpose**: Assess whether the custom request is **technically and commercially feasible**.
- **Output**: A feasibility report or recommendation.

---

### 9. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**  
- **Purpose**: Evaluate the feasibility of the custom request.
- **Type**: **Exclusive Gateway (XOR)** — only one of the branches is taken.
- **Paths**:
  - **If Yes**  Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"
  - **If No**  Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"  **End Event**

---

### 10. **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**  
- **Purpose**: Generate a quotation for the custom request.
- **Output**: A detailed proposal to the customer.

---

### 11. **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**  
- **Purpose**: Inform the customer that the request cannot be fulfilled.
- **Output**: A rejection notice or explanation.
- **Ends the process**.

---

##  **Convergence of Paths: After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed**

At this point, both **Standard** and **Custom** paths have completed their respective tasks (Task D for Standard, and Task E1 for Custom). The process now converges to a **common path** to handle **approval** and **final steps**.

---

### 12. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**  
- **Purpose**: Determine if **managerial approval** is required before finalizing the request.
- **Type**: **Exclusive Gateway (XOR)** — only one of the branches is taken.
- **Paths**:
  - **If Yes**  Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"
  - **If No**  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"

---

### 13. **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**  
- **Purpose**: Get approval from a manager or supervisor.
- **Output**: Manager’s approval or rejection.

---

### 14. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**  
- **Purpose**: Evaluate the manager’s decision.
- **Type**: **Exclusive Gateway (XOR)** — only one of the branches is taken.
- **Paths**:
  - **If Yes**  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"
  - **If No**  Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"  **Loop back to Task E1 or D**

---

### 15. **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**  
- **Purpose**: Create the final invoice for the customer.
- **Output**: Invoice document for billing.

---

### 16. **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**  
- **Purpose**: Reassess the conditions that led to the rejection (e.g., feasibility, credit, or inventory).
- **Output**: Updated conditions or revised request.
- **Loop back to**:
  - **Task E1** if the **Custom** path was taken.
  - **Task D** if the **Standard** path was taken.

---

### 17. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**  
- **Purpose**: Notify the customer of the outcome (invoice sent, rejection, or re-evaluation).
- **Output**: Confirmation message or document.
- **End Event**: The process concludes.

---

##  **Looping and Convergence Summary**

- **Parallel Execution**:
  - In the **Standard** path, **Credit Check** and **Inventory Check** are executed in parallel.
  - They **converge** at the **"All Parallel Checks Completed"** gateway.

- **Looping**:
  - If **approval is denied**, the process loops back to either:
    - **Task D** (Standard path) or
    - **Task E1** (Custom path) to re-evaluate the conditions.

- **Convergence**:
  - After **Task D** (Standard) or **Task E1** (Custom), the process converges to the **"Is Approval Needed?"** gateway.

##  **Differences Between Standard and Custom Paths**

| Task/Step | Standard Request Path | Custom Request Path |
|----------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| **Check Request Type** | Proceeds to **Task B1** | Proceeds to **Task B2** |
| **Validation** | Standard validation | Feasibility analysis |
| **Parallel Checks** | Credit + Inventory checks | No parallel checks |
| **Quotation** | Not required | Required (Task E1) |
| **Rejection** | Only if approval denied | Rejection after infeasibility |
| **Looping** | Loop back to **Task D** | Loop back to **Task E1** |

---

##  **Summary of Key Conditions and Triggers**

| Condition | Trigger | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Request Type = Standard | Check Request Type | Go to Task B1 |
| Request Type = Custom | Check Request Type | Go to Task B2 |
| Customization Feasible = Yes | Feasibility Check | Prepare Quotation (Task E1) |
| Customization Feasible = No | Feasibility Check | Send Rejection (Task E2) |
| Approval Needed = Yes | Approval Check | Obtain Approval (Task F) |
| Approval Granted = Yes | Approval Check | Generate Invoice (Task G) |
| Approval Granted = No | Approval Check | Re-evaluate Conditions (Task H) |
| All Parallel Checks Completed | After Credit & Inventory Checks | Proceed to Task D |
| Task D or E1 Completed | After validation | Proceed to Approval Check |

##  **Conclusion**

This process effectively **classifies customer requests**, **validates them**, **evaluates feasibility**, **obtains approvals**, and **issues final invoices**. It supports both **standard** and **custom** workflows, with **conditional branching**, **parallel execution**, and **looping** mechanisms to handle rework or re-evaluation when needed. The use of **gateways** ensures that the process flows logically and efficiently, adapting to the nature of each request.
