Below is a structured, end-to-end approach that uses process mining to understand Precision Parts Inc.’s current scheduling behavior, diagnose issues, and design and validate advanced scheduling strategies tailored to a high-mix, low-volume, disruption-prone job shop.

1) Analyze historical scheduling performance and dynamics with process mining

Data preparation and event model
- Unify the event log across lifecycle states so each operation has a clear chain: Job Released  Queue Entry (per machine)  Setup Start/End  Task Start/End  Queue Entry next machine …  Job Complete.
- Create operation IDs (JobID-OpSeq) and machine timelines to model resource states. From the log, derive “implicit” events such as Idle, Starved, Blocked by filling gaps on machine timelines (e.g., if queue length > 0 and no processing, that interval is Setup; if queue length = 0 and no processing, Idle/Starved; if processing complete but next buffer full, Blocked).
- Enrich events with attributes: job features (material, part family, tolerances), routing, priority, due date, planned vs. actual durations, operator, shift, and flags for disruptions overlapping each operation.

Process discovery and conformance checking
- Use an inductive miner or directly-follows graph (DFG) to discover the end-to-end routing variants from the logs (which actually occurred), with performance overlays to show median/percentile times on arcs.
- If a “standard routing” reference model exists, run alignment-based conformance to quantify deviations (rework loops, skipped steps, extra steps) and their cost in time.
- Use dotted charts to visualize temporal patterns (queue spikes by time-of-day/day-of-week); use variant analysis to separate “on-time” vs. “late” job variants.

Key metrics and how to compute them
- Job flow and lead times
  - Flow time per job = completion timestamp of last operation – release timestamp.
  - Lead time vs. due date: lateness = completion – due date; tardiness = max(0, lateness). Report weighted tardiness by order priority. Provide distribution percentiles and tail behavior.
  - Makespan (by day/shift) = last completion – first start for that horizon; also batch-level makespan for hot jobs.

- Queue and waiting times
  - For each operation: queue wait = Task Start – Queue Entry. Aggregate by machine, shift, product family. Show distributions and p95/p99 to expose heavy tails.
  - Time-in-system decomposition per job: sum of queue times, setup times, run times, blocked times.

- Resource utilization and breakdown of time
  - For each machine, build a time-state series with mutually exclusive states: Setup, Processing, Idle/Starved, Blocked, Down (breakdown/maintenance), Changeover Lost Time (subset of Setup if instrumented).
  - Utilization = Processing / Available time; Setup fraction; Starved fraction; Blocked fraction. Compute OEE-like metrics if quality loss is tracked.

- Sequence-dependent setup analysis
  - For each machine, build a changeover matrix C(prev  next), where each entry contains empirical setup time statistics: mean, median, p90, variance, and sample size.
  - Model setup time as a function of predecessor-successor features using regression or gradient-boosted trees: Setup ~ f(prev_material, curr_material, fixture/tool family change, tolerance class, lot size, operator, time since last similar job, after-breakdown flag, shift).
  - Produce a “setup distance” map: high-cost edges that should be avoided; identify dominant pairings that consume most setup time (Pareto).

- Schedule adherence and tardiness
  - If planned schedules exist, compute adherence/plan deviation per operation: schedule start vs. actual start; planned vs. actual durations; slippage accumulation across the route.
  - If no plan baseline, use due date conformance; segment by priority to see whether high-priority jobs still suffer high tardiness.

- Impact of disruptions
  - Event study: for each breakdown window, identify overlapping jobs and quantify added queue time and lateness vs. a matched control set (similar jobs not overlapping breakdown).
  - For hot-job arrivals: measure preemptions/changeovers triggered, queue reordering, spillover tardiness on displaced jobs, and added setups generated by priority changes.

2) Diagnose scheduling pathologies with evidence

Likely findings and how to evidence them
- True bottlenecks
  - Machines with persistent high utilization (>85%) plus long queues and high “queue time to process time” ratios; use bottleneck mining to show that a small set of machines determine overall throughput and tardiness.
  - Quantify throughput sensitivity to bottleneck state by correlating shop-wide WIP and outgoing completions with bottleneck queue length.

- Poor prioritization
  - High share of late deliveries in “High (Urgent)” class; late-stage queues where high-priority jobs wait behind low-priority ones; critical ratio violations (CR = time until due date / remaining processing time).
  - Variant analysis: late jobs show longer waits at bottleneck machines in the last 1–2 operations; or they experience more re-sequencing after hot jobs arrive.

- Excessive setup loss due to suboptimal sequencing
  - Share of time in setup on bottleneck machines; day-level “setup regret”: compare actual total setup time to the minimum achievable given the set of jobs actually processed that day (solve a TSP-like approximation on the observed job set with changeover costs from the changeover matrix).
  - Identify high-cost changeovers executed frequently despite viable lower-cost alternatives in the queue.

- Starvation and blocking cascades
  - Downstream machines show high starved time while upstream queues swell; cross-correlation of upstream queue length vs. downstream starved time with positive lag indicates release/sequencing mismatches.
  - Instances where interruptions at one machine propagate long blocked intervals upstream.

- WIP bullwhip and variability amplification
  - Large, oscillatory WIP patterns by center; dotted charts show spikes post-breakdowns or after batch releases, followed by starvation later.
  - Kingman-based expectations (queueing theory) vs. observed waits: if observed waits exceed what would be predicted by capacity/variability, scheduling policy is implicated.

- Operator effects and learning
  - Operator-specific run/setup time differences; shift-change effects with repeatable queue buildups; inconsistent staffing at bottlenecks during peak windows.

3) Root causes and separating policy vs. capacity

Probable root causes
- Static dispatching rules (FCFS/EDD) are myopic
  - They ignore sequence-dependent setup costs, remaining route time, downstream queues, and high-priority due-date risk; they react locally but not globally.

- Insufficient real-time visibility and coordination
  - Local decisions don’t consider global bottleneck states or hot-job ripple effects; no integrated estimate of remaining completion time.

- Duration and setup estimation errors
  - Planned durations understate actuals; setup distributions are context-dependent but treated as constants or ignored.

- No explicit setup management
  - Without family-based batching or setup-aware sequencing, bottleneck machines lose significant time to avoidable changeovers.

- Weak disruption response
  - Breakdowns and hot jobs cause whiplash re-sequencing; no stable, bounded-reactivity rescheduling policy; no buffers sized to risk.

Distinguishing scheduling issues from true capacity limitations
- Capacity-driven delays: if bottleneck utilization is near 95% with high service-time variability (CV > 1), long queues are inevitable; predicted Wq from queueing theory matches observed waits.
- Policy-driven delays: if utilization is moderate (e.g., 70–85%) yet waits are long, or if waits drop sharply when re-sequencing to reduce setups, the policy is at fault.
- Use counterfactual simulation: hold capacity and variability fixed but change the sequencing policy to see if tardiness falls. If improvements are large, logic is the root cause; if not, capacity or variability dominates.

4) Advanced, data-driven scheduling strategies

Strategy 1: Dynamic, setup-aware, due-date-driven dispatching (ATCS+RPT+congestion)
Core logic
- For each machine when it becomes free, compute a priority index for each queued job that combines:
  - Due-date urgency: low slack = due date – current time – predicted remaining route time.
  - Remaining processing time (RPT) across all remaining operations.
  - Sequence-dependent setup penalty based on predicted setup from the current machine’s last job to candidate job.
  - Downstream congestion: predicted wait at the next bottleneck(s) given current queues.
  - Priority weight: higher for urgent/hot jobs; include cost-of-delay by customer class if available.
- Select job with the best index; allow limited lookahead to break ties by minimizing expected increase in future tardiness.

How process mining informs it
- Use mined predictive models for run/setup times by job features, operator, and machine; use the empirical changeover matrix.
- Use live queue snapshots and historical service-time distributions to estimate downstream congestion.

Addresses pathologies
- Reduces late jobs by using remaining route time and slack, not just EDD.
- Cuts setup losses by penalizing high-cost changeovers in the priority index.
- Alleviates starvation/blocking via downstream-congestion terms.

Expected impact
- Typical gains in high-mix shops: 20–40% reduction in weighted tardiness, 10–25% reduction in average queue time at bottlenecks, 5–15% less setup time on constrained machines. Exact gains to be validated via simulation.

Implementation notes
- Start with an Apparent Tardiness Cost with Setups (ATCS) style index and tune weights per machine via Bayesian optimization on historical/simulated data.
- Refresh decisions event-driven (machine free, hot job arrives, breakdown ends) with a 1–5 minute cadence.
- Optional: learn weights online with contextual bandits or reinforcement learning under guardrails.

Strategy 2: Predict-then-optimize rolling-horizon scheduling (stochastic MILP/CP)
Core logic
- Every 30–60 minutes, compute a finite-capacity schedule over a rolling 8–16 hour horizon that:
  - Uses predicted processing and sequence-dependent setup times by job-machine pair; includes operator availability calendars and maintenance.
  - Minimizes weighted tardiness plus setup time and a penalty for WIP (e.g., sum of flow times) subject to precedence and machine capacity.
  - Incorporates uncertainty by adding risk buffers or solving a scenario-based robust plan (e.g., sample from duration distributions and breakdown scenarios).
- Freeze a short “frozen zone” (e.g., 60–90 minutes) to ensure stability; beyond that, allow re-optimization.

How process mining informs it
- Calibrated stochastic time models: lognormal or gamma fits by context for run and setup; breakdown intensity and repair-time distributions; learned changeover matrix.
- Route variants and precedence constraints discovered from logs.

Addresses pathologies
- Better due-date reliability from realistic time estimates and finite-capacity scheduling.
- Proactive bottleneck load leveling and setup-aware sequencing reduce avoidable queues.
- Robustness to breakdowns through scenarios/buffers limits schedule whiplash.

Expected impact
- 25–50% reduction in late jobs in volatile shops; 10–30% lower WIP; higher schedule adherence and more accurate promise dates.

Implementation notes
- Use CP-SAT or MILP with valid inequalities for sequence-dependent setups (e.g., time-indexed or disjunctive constraints with changeover times).
- Generate initial solutions via the Strategy 1 heuristic; solve within fixed time budgets.
- Feed predicted breakdown windows (from maintenance models) as time-off-capacity or elevated risk buffers.

Strategy 3: Setup-time optimization via family campaigns and sequence design
Core logic
- Define product/fixture/tool “families” using clustering on the features that drive setup time (identified from the setup model).
- On setup-intensive machines (true bottlenecks), run short “campaigns”:
  - Time-boxed windows where the machine prioritizes jobs from the same family to minimize changeovers.
  - Within each family window, sequence by due-date-driven rules (e.g., CR or ATC).
- Implement a release strategy aligned to campaigns:
  - Hold/release jobs to ensure enough family-compatible work is available when the campaign starts.
  - Limit maximum campaign length to avoid excessive lateness for other families; dynamically shrink/expand campaigns based on due-date pressure.
- Add “pre-staging” and SMED improvements: tool kitting in parallel; pre-setup on standby fixtures when possible.

How process mining informs it
- Uses the learned changeover matrix to define family boundaries and quantify intra- vs. inter-family setup savings.
- Measures the trade-off between setup reduction and due-date penalties by simulating day-level job sets.

Addresses pathologies
- Eliminates high-cost changeovers that dominate lost time on bottlenecks.
- Reduces variability in service times at bottlenecks, stabilizing queues and lowering WIP oscillations.

Expected impact
- 20–40% reduction in setup time on targeted machines; 10–20% throughput increase on bottlenecks; better schedule stability. Net tardiness impact depends on campaign tuning.

Implementation notes
- Start with daily or half-shift family windows; protect 15–25% capacity for cross-family urgent work.
- Combine with a CONWIP/WLC cap so upstream release aligns with campaign mix.

Optional complementary levers
- Workload Control (CONWIP) and gated order release to cap WIP per center, guided by historical lead-time curves.
- Reactive rescheduling policy with bounded disruption: small, frequent updates on local machines, larger re-optimizations only after major disruptions.
- Due-date quotation model driven by current WIP and predictive lead-time estimates to avoid over-promising.

5) Simulation, evaluation, and continuous improvement

Discrete-event simulation (DES) for validation before go-live
- Model scope and calibration
  - Entities: jobs with routings discovered from logs; resources: machines and operators with calendars.
  - Time models: per-machine, per-family run-time distributions; sequence-dependent setup distributions from the changeover matrix; breakdown and repair distributions; urgent job arrival process; rework probabilities if applicable.
  - Control logic: implement baseline (current FCFS/EDD), Strategy 1, Strategy 2, and Strategy 3 (plus combinations).

- Experimental design
  - Scenarios
    - Baseline demand vs. high-load (85–95% bottleneck utilization).
    - Disruption-intensive (higher breakdown frequency, clustered hot jobs).
    - Mix volatility (more variants, shorter lots).
    - Operator shortages/shift gaps.
    - Sensitivity to estimation error (add noise to predicted times).
  - Replications and horizons: multiple weeks of simulated time with warm-up removal; 20–50 replications per scenario.

- KPIs and statistical comparison
  - Delivery: on-time rate, mean/median/95th weighted tardiness, lateness tails.
  - Flow: average and percentile lead time by family/priority, flow-time decomposition (queue vs. setup vs. run).
  - WIP: time-weighted average and max WIP per center; queue length distributions.
  - Resource: utilization by state (process/setup/idle/blocked/down); setup fraction on bottlenecks.
  - Stability: number and magnitude of reschedules; schedule adherence.
  - Promise-date accuracy: mean absolute error of quoted vs. actual completion.
  - Use bootstrapped CIs, effect sizes, and cost impact (penalties, expedite costs, overtime).

Continuous monitoring and adaptation loop
- Real-time KPI tracking and alerts
  - Streaming process mining on MES events to compute near-real-time WIP, queue times, utilization states, due-date risk lists.
  - SPC/EWMA/CUSUM on key metrics (run/setup time medians, p95 queue time at bottlenecks) to detect drifts or abnormal congestion.

- Drift detection and model updates
  - Periodic refit of duration and setup models; use concept-drift detectors (e.g., ADWIN) on prediction residuals to trigger retraining.
  - Refresh changeover matrix weekly; re-run clustering for families if pairwise setup patterns shift.

- Policy parameter learning
  - Online tuning of Strategy 1 weights via Bayesian optimization on rolling windows, constrained to avoid excessive instability.
  - Quarterly re-optimization of campaign lengths and WIP caps using recent demand mix and performance.

- Governance and decisioning
  - “Traffic light” dashboards for each bottleneck: today’s predicted lateness risk, recommended campaign plan, hot-job impact forecast.
  - A/B testing in simulation before parameter changes go live; limited pilots on one shift or one cell before full rollout.
  - Post-mortems for major disruptions: automated event studies to quantify impact and refine response playbooks.

Practical rollout plan
- Month 1–2: Data engineering and baseline mining. Build machine timelines, compute KPIs, discover setup drivers, and identify bottlenecks.
- Month 3: Implement Strategy 1 in a shadow mode dashboard; run DES to compare strategies and tune parameters.
- Month 4: Pilot Strategy 1 on one bottleneck center with operator training and guardrails; begin campaign trials for Strategy 3 on the same center.
- Month 5–6: Introduce rolling-horizon Strategy 2 for global coordination; integrate predictive maintenance calendars. Expand campaigns and WIP caps.
- Ongoing: Continuous monitoring, periodic model refresh, and targeted SMED activities where the setup model flags large opportunities.

This approach links what actually happens on the shop floor (as reconstructed from the MES logs) to decisions that directly influence due-date performance, WIP, and utilization. It replaces isolated, static dispatching with predictive, setup-aware, bottleneck-focused control—validated in simulation and continuously adapted to changing conditions.
