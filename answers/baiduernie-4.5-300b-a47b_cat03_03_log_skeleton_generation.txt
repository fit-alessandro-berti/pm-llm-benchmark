Below is a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process scenario. The constraints are defined based on logical dependencies and business rules inherent in the process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        # No activities must occur exactly the same number of times in every trace.
        # However, we can define pairs that are logically equivalent in occurrence.
        # For example, if 'Pack Order' happens, 'Generate Shipping Label' must also happen (and vice versa in terms of presence).
        # But since equivalence is strict, we leave this empty unless there are clear cases (e.g., no strict equivalence here).
    },
    'always_before': {
        # Activities that must precede others if they occur.
        ('RO', 'CA'),    # Must check availability after receiving the order.
        ('CA', 'RI'),    # Must reserve items only after availability is confirmed.
        ('RI', 'PI'),    # Must pick items only after they are reserved.
        ('PI', 'QC'),    # Quality check must follow picking.
        ('QC', 'PO'),    # Packing must follow quality check.
        ('PO', 'GSL'),   # Shipping label must be generated after packing.
        ('GSL', 'D'),    # Dispatch must follow shipping label generation.
        ('D', 'IC'),     # Invoice is sent after dispatch (assuming billing happens post-shipment).
    },
    'always_after': {
        # Activities that must be followed by others if they occur.
        # This is the inverse of 'always_before' but is defined conditionally.
        # For example, if 'IC' occurs, it must be followed by 'RP' (payment recording).
        ('IC', 'RP'),    # Payment recording must follow invoicing.
        # Note: Other constraints are covered by 'always_before' or process flow.
    },
    'never_together': {
        # Activities that cannot co-exist in the same case (trace).
        # For example, if 'RO' is missing, certain steps like 'CA' shouldn't exist (but this is hard to represent).
        # Here, we focus on mutually exclusive activities like retrying steps (simplified).
        # In practice, this is rare in a linear process unless there are retries/cancellations.
        # Assuming no strict "never together" pairs in normal execution.
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        # Bounds on the number of occurrences per activity in a case (trace).
        'RO': {1},       # Each case starts with exactly one order receipt.
        'CA': {1},       # Availability is checked once per order.
        'RI': {1},       # Items are reserved once per order.
        'PI': {1},       # Items are picked once per order (assuming no partial picks).
        'QC': {0, 1},    # Quality check might be skipped in some simplified cases.
        'PO': {1},       # Order is packed once.
        'GSL': {1},      # One shipping label per order.
        'D': {1},        # One dispatch event per order.
        'IC': {1},       # One invoice per order.
        'RP': {0, 1},    # Payment might not be recorded immediately or could be missing.
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        # Strictly adjacent activities (no intermediate steps between them if the first occurs).
        ('RO', 'CA'),    # Receive Order is immediately followed by Check Availability.
        ('CA', 'RI'),    # Check Availability is immediately followed by Reserve Items.
        ('RI', 'PI'),    # Reserve Items is immediately followed by Pick Items.
        ('PI', 'QC'),    # Pick Items is immediately followed by Quality Check.
        ('QC', 'PO'),    # Quality Check is immediately followed by Pack Order.
        ('PO', 'GSL'),   # Pack Order is immediately followed by Generate Shipping Label.
        ('GSL', 'D'),    # Generate Shipping Label is immediately followed by Dispatch.
        ('D', 'IC'),     # Dispatch is immediately followed by Invoice Customer.
        ('IC', 'RP'),    # Invoice Customer is immediately followed by Record Payment (if no delays).
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Constraints:
1. **Equivalence**: Left empty as no two activities have a strict equivalence in the given process.
2. **Always Before**: Captures the sequential dependencies (e.g., `RO` must happen before `CA`).
3. **Always After**: Used sparingly for successors that are not direct (e.g., `IC` must eventually be followed by `RP`).
4. **Never Together**: Left empty as the process is linear, and no strict mutual exclusivity exists in normal execution.
5. **Activity Occurrences (`activ_freq`)**:
   - Critical activities like `RO`, `CA`, `PI`, etc., occur exactly once per order.
   - Optional activities like `QC` or `RP` have bounds allowing omission.
6. **Directly Follows**: Enforces strict adjacency for key sequential steps (e.g., `PO` must directly precede `GSL`).

### Notes:
- The model assumes a "happy path" without loops or retries. In practice, you might need additional constraints for error handling (e.g., rechecking availability if reservation fails).
- Adjust `activ_freq` bounds if returned items, partial shipments, or other complexities are introduced.
