Based on the provided interview transcripts, I will generate a BPMN-like textual process model that captures the key steps, decision points, and roles involved in the invoice approval process. Here’s the structured model:

### Invoice Approval Process

1. **Start Event**
   - **Trigger:** Receipt of an invoice.

2. **Check Purchase Order Number (PO)**
   - **Activity:** Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk)
   - **Condition:** Invoice has a valid PO number.
   - **Decision Point:**
     - **Yes Path:** Proceed to log the invoice in the accounting system.
     - **No Path:** Send the invoice back to the supplier for more details.

3. **Log Invoice into Accounting System**
   - **Activity:** Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk)

4. **Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department**
   - **Activity:** Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk)
   - **Condition:** Invoice has a valid PO number.
   - **Trigger:** Confirmation from the Purchasing Department that the goods or services were received.

5. **Confirm Invoice Matching with PO**
   - **Activity:** Dan (Purchasing Officer)
   - **Condition:** Invoice details match the PO.
   - **Decision Point:**
     - **Yes Path:** Send a confirmation email to Accounts Payable.
     - **No Path:** Contact the supplier or request more details from Accounts Payable.

6. **Generate Automatic Email Request for Manager's Approval**
   - **Activity:** System
   - **Condition:** Invoice matching has been confirmed.

7. **Manager's Approval**
   - **Activity:** Carlos (Department Manager)
   - **Condition:** Invoice details are correct and match the PO.
   - **Decision Point:**
     - **Yes Path:** Schedule the invoice for payment.
     - **No Path:** Reject or request further investigation.

8. **Schedule Payment**
   - **Activity:** Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk)
   - **Condition:** Invoice has been approved by the manager.

9. **Exception Handling**
   - **Activity:** Rita (Accounts Payable Supervisor)
   - **Condition:** Invoice cannot be matched or has discrepancies.
   - **Decision Point:**
     - **Escalate to Rita:**
       - **If Supplier Issue:** Contact supplier to resolve.
       - **If Informal Contract:** Work with department heads to create a retrospective PO.
     - **Return to Normal Flow:** After exceptions are resolved, proceed to manager's approval.

10. **End Event**
    - **Condition:** Invoice is fully approved and scheduled for payment.
