Okay, so I need to write a DuckDB SQL query that filters out cases with more than six events and returns all events from cases that have six or fewer. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I remember that in SQL, when you want to filter based on aggregate values like the number of events per case, you usually need to use a HAVING clause. But since each event is an individual row, grouping by case_id and counting might help here.

So, maybe start by creating a subquery or CTE that counts the number of events per case_id. Then filter those cases where the count is <=6. Once I have those case_ids, I can join back to the original table to get all their events.

Alternatively, another approach could be using a window function with COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) but not sure if DuckDB supports that. Maybe better to stick with GROUP BY and HAVING for simplicity.

Wait, here's an idea: first calculate for each case_id the count of events by grouping on case_id and counting all rows. Then use this result to filter the original event_log table by only including case_ids where their total count is <=6.

So maybe write a query that uses a subquery in the FROM clause. Like:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);

Yes, this seems right. The inner query groups by case_id and selects those with count <=6. Then the outer query gets all events for those cases.

But wait, DuckDB's syntax might require some tweaking? Let me check: IN operator is standard SQL, so that should work.

Alternatively, could use a JOIN between event_log and the grouped subquery. But using WHERE ... IN (subquery) seems more straightforward.

Testing with an example: Suppose case_id 1 has 5 events, case_id 2 has 7. The inner query will get case_id 1. Then the outer query selects all rows where case_id is in that list (just 1). So yes.

Another approach could be a CTE:

WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <=6
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id;

But whether using IN or JOIN, both methods should work. Probably the first one is simpler.

Now, make sure that grouping by case_id and filtering with HAVING is correct. Yes, because after GROUP BY case_id, the COUNT(*) gives per-group counts, then HAVING filters those groups where count <=6.

Yes, so I think the query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);

That should do it. Check for syntax: DuckDB supports this standard SQL syntax.

I don't see any issues here. So the query selects all events where their case_id is in the list of case_ids that have a count of six or fewer.

To solve this problem, we need to filter out cases (process instances) that contain more than six events and return only the events from cases with six or fewer events. This requires counting the number of events per `case_id` and using that count to filter the results.

### Approach
1. **Subquery for Filtering**: Use a subquery to group the event log by `case_id` and calculate the total number of events per case.
2. **HAVING Clause**: Apply the HAVING clause in the subquery to filter out cases where the count exceeds six.
3. **Main Query**: In the main query, select all events from the original table where the `case_id` is present in the result set obtained from the subquery.

This approach efficiently filters out unwanted cases by leveraging a subquery with aggregation and conditional filtering before joining back to the original data.

### Solution Code
```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

### Explanation
- **Subquery**: The inner query groups events by `case_id` and uses the HAVING clause to retain only those groups where the count of events is six or fewer.
9. **Main Query**: The outer query then selects all events from the original table (`event_log`) where the `case_id` matches any of the case IDs returned by the subquery. This ensures that only cases with six or fewer events are included in the final result, while preserving all their individual event records.
