Based on the product design and launch process, here's a Python dictionary representing the DECLARE model:

```python
declare_model = {
    # Unary constraints
    'existence': {
        'IG': (1.0, 1.0),      # Idea Generation must always occur
        'DD': (1.0, 1.0),      # Design Draft must always occur
        'AG': (1.0, 1.0),      # Approval Gate must always occur
        'FL': (1.0, 1.0)       # Final Launch must always occur
    },
    
    'absence': {},             # No activities are forbidden
    
    'exactly_one': {},         # Activities can occur multiple times if needed
    
    'init': {
        'IG': (1.0, 0.95)      # Idea Generation should be the first activity
    },
    
    # Binary constraints
    'responded_existence': {
        ('DD', 'TFC'): (1.0, 0.95),    # Design Draft requires Technical Feasibility Check
        ('DD', 'CE'): (1.0, 0.95),     # Design Draft requires Cost Evaluation
        ('PC', 'LT'): (1.0, 0.90),     # Prototype Creation requires Laboratory Testing
        ('PC', 'UT'): (1.0, 0.90),     # Prototype Creation requires User Testing
        ('AG', 'MP'): (1.0, 0.85)      # Approval Gate requires Marketing Plan
    },
    
    'coexistence': {
        ('TFC', 'CE'): (1.0, 0.90),    # Technical check and cost evaluation go together
        ('LT', 'UT'): (1.0, 0.85)      # Both types of testing usually occur together
    },
    
    'response': {
        ('IG', 'DD'): (1.0, 1.0),      # Idea Generation must be followed by Design Draft

    'precedence': {
        ('IG', 'DD'): (1.0, 1.0),      # Idea Generation must precede Design Draft
        ('DD', 'TFC'): (1.0, 1.0),     # Design Draft must precede Technical Feasibility
        ('DD', 'CE'): (1.0, 1.0),      # Design Draft must precede Cost Evaluation
        ('DD', 'PC'): (1.0, 0.95),     # Design Draft must precede Prototype Creation
        ('PC', 'LT'): (1.0, 1.0),      # Prototype must precede Laboratory Testing
        ('PC', 'UT'): (1.0, 1.0),      # Prototype must precede User Testing
        ('TFC', 'AG'): (1.0, 0.95),    # Technical Feasibility must precede Approval

        ('AG', 'FL'): (1.0, 1.0)       # Approval must precede Final Launch
    },
    
    'succession': {
        ('IG', 'DD'): (1.0, 1.0),      # Both occur, IG before DD
        ('DD', 'TFC'): (1.0, 0.95),    # Both occur, DD before TFC
        ('DD', 'CE'): (1.0, 0.95),     # Both occur, DD before CE
        ('PC', 'LT'): (1.0, 0.85),     # Both occur, PC before LT
        ('PC', 'UT'): (1.0, 0.85),     # Both occur, PC before UT
        ('AG', 'FL'): (1.0, 0.95)      # Both occur, AG before FL
    },
    
    'altresponse': {},                  # No strict alternating response patterns
    
    'altprecedence': {},                # No strict alternating precedence patterns
    
    'altsuccession': {},                # No strict alternating succession patterns
    
    'chainresponse': {
        ('AG', 'MP'): (1.0, 0.70)      # Marketing Plan often immediately follows Approval
    },

    'chainsuccession': {},              # No strict chain succession patterns
    
    'noncoexistence': {},               # No mutually exclusive activities
    
    'nonsuccession': {},                # No forbidden succession patterns
    
    'nonchainsuccession': {}            # No forbidden chain succession patterns
}
```

This DECLARE model captures the following key business rules:
- The process always starts with Idea Generation
- Core activities (IG, DD, AG, FL) must occur in every process
- Technical and cost evaluations are typically done together
- Prototypes require both lab and user testing
- Approval is required before final launch
- Marketing planning typically happens after approval
- The model allows for iterations and rework where appropriate
