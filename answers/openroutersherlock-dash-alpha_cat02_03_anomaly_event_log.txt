### Analysis of Anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay Event Log

The standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process follows a logical, sequential flow to ensure proper authorization, vendor commitment, goods receipt, invoice verification, and payment, minimizing risks like fraud, overpayment, or unverified expenditures. Typical sequence:
1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  **Approve Purchase Requisition**  **Issue Purchase Order** (PO).
2. **Receive Goods** (confirms delivery).
3. **Vendor Invoice Received**  **Match Invoice to PO** (three-way match: PO, goods receipt, invoice).
4. **Release Payment**  **Close Case**.

**Case 1001** follows this standard flow closely—no anomalies.

#### Anomalies Identified

**Case 1002** (Multiple severe sequence violations):
- **Issue Purchase Order** (before requisition approval).
- **Vendor Invoice Received** and **Release Payment** (both *before* requisition approval and goods receipt).
- **Approve Purchase Requisition** (after PO issuance, invoice, and payment).
- **Receive Goods** (after payment).
- **Match Invoice to PO** (delayed until after goods receipt).

*Why problematic?*
- Issuing a PO without requisition approval bypasses internal controls and authorization, risking unauthorized purchases.
- Receiving/processing/paying an invoice without goods receipt or PO matching violates the three-way match principle, enabling fraudulent invoices or payments for undelivered/unordered goods (potential fraud risk).
- Approving the requisition *after* payment is a critical control failure—essentially rubber-stamping post-facto, which could facilitate kickbacks or self-dealing.
- Late goods receipt after payment increases exposure to non-delivery disputes.

**Case 1003** (Premature payment):
- **Release Payment** (before Vendor Invoice Received, Receive Goods, or Match Invoice to PO).

*Why problematic?*
- Payment without an invoice, goods receipt, or matching defies all verification controls. This resembles a "payment without invoice" scam or error, leading to overpayments, untraceable funds, or money laundering risks. In P2P, payment is the final step post-verification to prevent exactly this.

**Case 1004** (Goods received before PO issuance):
- **Receive Goods** (before Issue Purchase Order).
- **Issue Purchase Order** (after goods receipt and before invoice matching/payment).

*Why problematic?*
- Receiving goods without a PO lacks a formal commitment or pricing agreement with the vendor, risking acceptance of unordered/unapproved items, pricing disputes, or informal "backdoor" purchases that evade requisition/approval controls (common fraud vector).
- PO issued post-receipt complicates matching and auditing, as the PO becomes a retroactive justification rather than a prerequisite.

### Summary Table of Anomalies

| Case ID | Anomalous Activities (in order of occurrence) | Key Issue | Business Risk |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| **1002** | Issue PO  Invoice Received  Release Payment  Approve Requisition  Receive Goods | Out-of-sequence approvals, payment, and receipt | Fraud, unauthorized spend, no three-way match |
| **1003** | Release Payment  Invoice Received  Receive Goods  Match Invoice | Payment before any verification | Overpayment, invoice/goods fraud |
| **1004** | Receive Goods  Issue PO | Goods before formal PO | Uncontrolled receiving, procurement bypass |

**Case 1001** is normal. These anomalies (all except 1001) warrant investigation, as they deviate from P2P best practices (e.g., SAP/APQC standards), potentially indicating process errors, weak controls, or intentional misconduct like invoice fraud or collusion. Auditing timestamps/resources could reveal more (e.g., same user skipping approvals).
