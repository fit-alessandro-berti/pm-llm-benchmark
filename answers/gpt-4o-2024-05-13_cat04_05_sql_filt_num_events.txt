Certainly! Below is a DuckDB SQL query that filters out any cases containing more than six events and returns only the events from cases that have six or fewer events in total.

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) as event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)
SELECT
    event_log.*
FROM
    event_log
JOIN
    case_event_counts
ON
    event_log.case_id = case_event_counts.case_id
WHERE
    case_event_counts.event_count <= 6;
```

Here's a breakdown of the query:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `case_event_counts`:**
   - This CTE calculates the number of events for each `case_id` by grouping events with the same `case_id`.
   - The `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of events per case and is stored in the `event_count` column.

2. **Main Query:**
   - The `event_log` table is joined with the `case_event_counts` CTE on the `case_id` column, ensuring that we can filter events based on their `case_id`.
   - The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those cases where the `event_count` is six or fewer (`<= 6`).

This query returns all events for cases that have six or fewer total events.
