Based on the provided process variants, the underlying process can be described as a declaration submission and approval workflow with multiple possible paths and stakeholders. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Declaration Submission**:
   - The process begins with an EMPLOYEE submitting a declaration.
   - Alternatively, an EMPLOYEE can save a declaration as a draft (low frequency).

2. **Approval Workflow**:
   - After submission, the declaration goes through an approval workflow involving various stakeholders. The most common approval paths are:
     a. ADMINISTRATION -> SUPERVISOR
     b. ADMINISTRATION -> BUDGET OWNER -> SUPERVISOR
     c. PRE_APPROVER -> SUPERVISOR
   - In some cases, the SUPERVISOR can final approve a declaration directly after it's submitted by the EMPLOYEE.
   - At any stage, the declaration can be rejected by the reviewer (ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER, or SUPERVISOR). If rejected, the EMPLOYEE can resubmit the declaration, starting the approval workflow again.

3. **Rejection Handling**:
   - If a declaration is rejected, it's typically sent back to the EMPLOYEE.
   - The EMPLOYEE can then resubmit the declaration, which may go through the same approval path or a different one.
   - In some cases, a declaration can be rejected multiple times before ultimately being approved.

4. **Final Approval and Payment**:
   - Once the declaration is finally approved by the SUPERVISOR, a payment request is made.
   - Finally, the payment is handled, marking the end of the process.

5. **Exceptions**:
   - In a few cases, the process ends with the declaration being rejected by the ADMINISTRATION or the EMPLOYEE not resubmitting a rejected declaration.
   - There are also instances where a declaration is approved but later rejected due to missing information.

The performance metric seems to represent the total time taken for each process variant. The frequency indicates how often each variant occurs, with the most common path being "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled".

This process map shows the importance of efficient approval workflows and proper rejection handling to ensure declarations are processed timely and accurately.
