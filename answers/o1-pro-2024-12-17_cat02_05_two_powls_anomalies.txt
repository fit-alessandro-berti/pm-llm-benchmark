Below is a structured analysis and comparison of the two given POWL models against a normative Hire-to-Retire process. A typical normative sequence might look like this:

**Normative Sequence:**  
1. Post Job Ad  
2. Screen Candidates  
3. Conduct Interviews  
4. Make Hiring Decision  
5. Onboard Employee  
6. Add to Payroll  
7. Close Case

This sequence implies a logical order that ensures proper vetting (screening and interviews) before making a hiring decision, followed by proper integration of the new hire (onboarding) and ensuring the hire’s payroll is set up, before the case is concluded.

### Analysis of Model 1

**Model 1 Structure:**
- Activities: Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close
- Partial order edges:
  - Post → Screen
  - Screen → Decide
  - Screen → Interview
  - Decide → Onboard
  - Onboard → Payroll
  - Payroll → Close

**Observations:**
- **Positive Alignments:**
  - The model ensures that the hiring decision (Decide) and interviews (Interview) only occur after the job has been posted (Post) and candidates have been screened (Screen).
  - Onboarding (Onboard) occurs after the decision (Decide), and Payroll occurs after Onboarding, followed by closing the case. This ensures that the final downstream steps (Onboard → Payroll → Close) follow a logical end-of-process chain similar to the standard flow.

- **Anomalies:**
  1. **Ordering of Interviews and Decision:**  
     The model places both "Make_Hiring_Decision" and "Conduct_Interviews" as directly succeeding "Screen_Candidates," but **does not enforce that interviews occur before the decision.** Instead, it places both "Decide" and "Interview" parallel after "Screen." This means in practice, the hiring decision could be made either before or without conducting any interviews, which severely violates logical hiring practice. Typically, interviews inform the hiring decision, so allowing the decision to precede interviews is a significant anomaly.

  2. **No Additional Control-Flow Anomalies:**  
     Apart from the potentially reversed decision/interview order, the rest of the process sequence is relatively structured. All steps (Onboard, Payroll, Close) appear in a sensible order once the decision is made.

**Severity of Anomaly in Model 1:**  
The main anomaly (deciding before interviewing) is quite severe from a hiring logic standpoint. However, it does not allow skipping critical process steps—every activity (including Onboarding and Payroll) still eventually takes place.

### Analysis of Model 2

**Model 2 Structure:**
- Activities: Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close
- Additional Operators:
  - A loop operator around Onboarding and a silent transition: This means onboarding can be repeated or potentially skipped.
  - An XOR operator before Payroll: This means Payroll or skip is chosen.

**Partial order edges:**
- Post → Screen
- Post → Interview
- Interview → Decide
- Decide → loop_onboarding (Onboard, skip)
- loop_onboarding → xor_payroll (Payroll, skip)
- xor_payroll → Close

**Observations:**
- **Positive Alignments:**
  - The model ensures that the "Make_Hiring_Decision" step occurs after "Conduct_Interviews." This is a significant improvement over Model 1’s logic in this critical step. Ensuring that interviews precede the decision respects the fundamental logic of hiring.

- **Anomalies:**
  1. **Parallel Screening and Interviewing Without Dependency:**
     The model allows "Screen_Candidates" and "Conduct_Interviews" to start in parallel right after "Post_Job_Ad." In principle, one might complete interviews (and thus make a decision) without necessarily completing or even meaningfully considering the screening results. While less severe than deciding before interviews, it still misaligns with the standard expectation that screening should inform who gets interviewed.

  2. **Skipping Onboarding:**
     The loop operator with a silent transition allows for the possibility that the "Onboard_Employee" activity could be skipped entirely. This is a grave anomaly: bringing a new hire onboard is central to the hire-to-retire process. Omitting onboarding compromises the employee’s integration and readiness for payroll and actual employment duties.

  3. **Skipping Payroll:**
     After the loop_onboarding step, an XOR operator allows choosing between "Add_to_Payroll" and a skip path. This means the process could end without the new hire ever being added to the payroll system. This is another severe violation—hiring someone and not adding them to payroll makes no sense from both a procedural and legal perspective.

**Severity of Anomalies in Model 2:**  
While the ordering of interviews before the decision is correct (which is good), the ability to skip critical, downstream steps—Onboarding and Payroll—is a fundamental break from normative hiring practice. Moreover, decoupling screening from interviews and decision steps (by allowing them to happen in parallel without enforced order) further reduces logical coherence. The ability to end the process without payroll or onboarding seriously undermines the integrity of the hire-to-retire lifecycle.

### Which Model is More Normative?

To determine which model more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process, we must consider the impact of the anomalies:

- **Model 1’s Key Anomaly:** The hiring decision can be made before conducting interviews. While serious, this model still ensures all key steps—screening, interviews (even if poorly ordered), onboarding, payroll, and closing—eventually occur. No step is skipped entirely; the sequence might be logically flawed, but it remains complete.

- **Model 2’s Key Anomalies:**  
  - It correctly ensures interviews occur before the hiring decision, which is a critical fix.  
  - However, it allows skipping of essential steps such as onboarding and payroll. This omission is deeply problematic. A hire-to-retire process that can conclude without onboarding an employee or setting them up in payroll is missing fundamental pillars of employee integration and proper HR administration.

Considering the real-world importance of each anomaly, skipping critical end-to-end lifecycle steps (onboarding, payroll) generally represents a more severe process design flaw than an incorrect internal ordering of pre-hire tasks. While making a decision without an interview is certainly illogical, the complete omission of crucial lifecycle stages is arguably more damaging to the normative logic of the entire hire-to-retire concept.

**Conclusion:**  
**Model 1** is closer to the normative sequence because it preserves all the essential steps—albeit with a problematic ordering issue—while **Model 2** introduces severe logical gaps that undermine the fundamental nature of the entire process (by allowing onboarding and payroll to be bypassed).

**Final Answer:**

- **Anomalies in Model 1:** Primarily that the hiring decision can be made before conducting interviews, which violates normal hiring logic but does not remove key activities.  
- **Anomalies in Model 2:** Allows for skipping critical parts of the process (onboarding and payroll) and does not strictly ensure that screening results inform the interviews and decision.  
- **More Normative Model:** Model 1 is more aligned with a normative Hire-to-Retire process because it keeps all essential steps intact, despite the incorrect ordering between interviews and the hiring decision.
