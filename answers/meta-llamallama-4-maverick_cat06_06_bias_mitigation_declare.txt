### Rationale for Added Constraints

The updated `declare_model` includes several new constraints to mitigate bias in the loan application process:

1.  **Existence Constraints for `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview`**:

    *   We added existence constraints for `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview` to ensure that these activities occur at least once in the process. This is crucial for fairness, as it guarantees that the process includes checks to mitigate bias and manual reviews for sensitive cases.
2.  **Coexistence Constraints for `ManualReview` with `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`**:

    *   We introduced coexistence constraints to ensure that `ManualReview` coexists with decision steps involving sensitive applicants (`Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`). This constraint promotes fairness by ensuring that manual reviews are performed for decisions related to applicants from minority groups.
3.  **Response and Succession Constraints for `BiasMitigationCheck`**:

    *   We added response and succession constraints to ensure that `BiasMitigationCheck` occurs after `CheckApplicantRace` and before `FinalDecision`. This constraint helps mitigate bias by ensuring that the process performs a bias mitigation check after checking the applicant's race and before making a final decision.
4.  **Precedence Constraints for `BiasMitigationCheck` before `Approve` and `Reject`**:

    *   We introduced precedence constraints to ensure that `BiasMitigationCheck` precedes `Approve` and `Reject` decisions. This constraint further ensures that bias mitigation checks are performed before making decisions that could be influenced by sensitive attributes.
5.  **Non-succession and Non-chain Succession Constraints for `CheckApplicantRace` and `CheckApplicantAge` to `Reject`**:

    *   We added non-succession and non-chain succession constraints to prevent direct succession from activities that disclose sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantRace` and `CheckApplicantAge`) to a `Reject` decision. This constraint helps prevent immediate biased outcomes by ensuring that there is at least one activity between the disclosure of sensitive attributes and a rejection decision.

These added constraints work together to reduce bias in the loan application process by ensuring that the process includes fairness-promoting activities and constraints that prevent direct biased outcomes.
