1. Issues with the current model  
   - By putting all downstream activities (Create PO, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match Invoice, Pay Invoice) inside a single ANDblock, the model allows them in *any* order (or even concurrently).  
   - This lets “Pay Invoice” fire before you’ve even received the invoice (or the goods), or “Match Invoice” before you’ve received anything, etc.  
   - In reality each of those steps must happen *strictly* in the order:  
     3. Create Purchase Order  
     4. Receive Goods  
     5. Receive Invoice  
     6. Match Invoice to PO  
     7. Pay Invoice  

2. Corrected process tree  
   Replace the big parallel block with a single strict sequence over all eight activities.  
   ```python
   from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

   # Define activities
   create_req      = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
   approve_req     = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
   create_po       = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
   receive_goods   = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
   receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
   match_invoice   = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
   pay_invoice     = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
   close_case      = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

   # Fixed model: everything in one strict sequence
   fixed_root = ProcessTree(
       operator=Operator.SEQUENCE,
       children=[
           create_req,
           approve_req,
           create_po,
           receive_goods,
           receive_invoice,
           match_invoice,
           pay_invoice,
           close_case
       ]
   )
   ```

3. Why this fixes the underfitting  
   - Operator.SEQUENCE enforces that each child’s activity can only start *after* the previous one has completed.  
   - You cannot “Pay Invoice” unless you have already “Matched Invoice to PO,” and you cannot match until you’ve “Received Invoice,” etc.  
   - No ANDblocks or XORblocks remain that would permit skipping or reordering any of the steps. The only executions admitted by this tree exactly mirror the intended 12345678 ordering.
