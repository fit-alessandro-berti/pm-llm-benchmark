**Optimizing TechSolve Solutions’ IT Service Desk: A Process Mining-Driven Approach to Resource Assignment**

---

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To uncover inefficiencies and hidden patterns in TechSolve’s resource assignment, I would leverage the event log to perform a multi-dimensional analysis of agent behavior, tier performance, and assignment logic. The goal is to move from *assumed* workflows to *actual* process behavior.

### Key Metrics for Agent and Tier Performance:

- **Workload Distribution**: 
  - *Metric*: Number of tickets handled per agent/tier per time period (day/week), average concurrent tickets.
  - *Insight*: Identify overloaded agents (e.g., Agent B12 handling 3x more tickets than peers) or underutilized agents (e.g., Agent B15 idle 60% of shift).

- **Activity Processing Times**:
  - *Metric*: Average duration from “Work Start” to “Work End” per agent, per ticket priority/category.
  - *Insight*: Compare L1 resolution times for P2 vs. P3 tickets; flag agents consistently exceeding tier benchmarks.

- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1**:
  - *Metric*: % of L1-handled tickets closed without escalation.
  - *Insight*: Low FCR (e.g., <30%) suggests L1 agents lack training, tools, or are assigned overly complex tickets.

- **Skill Utilization Rate**:
  - *Metric*: % of tickets assigned to agents where the “Required Skill” matches at least one “Agent Skill”.
  - *Insight*: Reveal skill mismatches (e.g., only 40% of “Networking-Firewall” tickets assigned to agents with that skill).

- **Escalation and Reassignment Frequency**:
  - *Metric*: Avg. # of reassignments per ticket, % of tickets reassigned >1 time.
  - *Insight*: High reassignment rates indicate poor initial assignment or unclear skill definitions.

### Process Mining Techniques to Reveal Actual Assignment Patterns:

- **Resource Interaction Analysis (Handover of Work)**:
  - Construct a *handover matrix* showing frequency of ticket transfers between agents or tiers.
  - *Example*: If Agent A05 (L1) frequently escalates to Agent B08 (L2), but B08 then reassigns to B15 (L2), this reveals a hidden bottleneck or skill gap.

- **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**:
  - Map collaboration networks based on ticket handovers. Identify “hubs” (overloaded specialists) or “isolates” (underutilized agents).
  - *Example*: Agent B12 appears as a central node receiving escalations from 5+ L1 agents — indicating over-reliance or lack of skill redundancy.

- **Role Discovery**:
  - Use clustering algorithms (e.g., based on activity profiles, skills used, ticket types handled) to discover *actual* roles vs. *declared* tiers.
  - *Example*: Some “L2” agents behave like “L1” (handling basic tickets), while others act as “L3” (handling only complex escalations). This misalignment suggests tier definitions need refinement.

- **Conformance Checking**:
  - Compare actual assignment paths against the *intended* logic (e.g., “L1  L2 only if skill mismatch”).
  - *Example*: 70% of escalations from L1 occur even when agent skill matches ticket requirement — indicating premature escalation or lack of confidence.

### Skill Utilization Analysis:

- **Skill Gap Heatmap**: 
  - Cross-tabulate “Required Skill” vs. “Agent Skill” for all assignments. Highlight combinations with low match rates (e.g., “Database-SQL” tickets assigned to non-SQL agents 65% of time).

- **Specialist Underutilization**:
  - Track % of time specialists (e.g., Agent B15 with “Database-SQL”) spend on tasks *below* their skill level (e.g., resetting passwords). If >30%, it indicates misassignment.

> **Insight Synthesis**: The analysis will likely reveal that the current round-robin + manual escalation logic ignores skill alignment and real-time workload, leading to frequent reassignments, specialist underutilization, and tier role drift.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Using the metrics and patterns above, I would pinpoint the following critical bottlenecks:

### A. Skill Shortage Bottlenecks:
- **Identification**: Tickets requiring “Networking-Firewall” show avg. 45-min wait time for L2 assignment and 80% reassignment rate.
- **Quantified Impact**: 60% of P2 SLA breaches are linked to delays in assigning firewall-skilled agents.

### B. Reassignment-Induced Delays:
- **Identification**: Tickets with 2 reassignments take 2.5x longer to resolve than those with 0–1 reassignments.
- **Quantified Impact**: Avg. delay per reassignment = 38 minutes. For P3 tickets, this pushes 40% beyond SLA.

### C. Incorrect Initial Assignments:
- **Identification**: 55% of tickets escalated from L1 have matching agent skills — suggesting L1 agents escalate prematurely or lack empowerment.
- **Quantified Impact**: These “false escalations” consume 25% of L2 capacity, delaying genuine L2 tickets.

### D. Agent Overload/Underutilization:
- **Identification**: Top 20% of agents handle 50% of tickets; bottom 20% handle <5%. Workload variance correlates with SLA breach rates (R² = 0.72).
- **Quantified Impact**: Overloaded agents have 3x higher error rates and 50% longer resolution times.

### E. SLA Breach Correlation:
- **Identification**: SLA breaches spike for:
  - Tickets reassigned >1 time (75% breach rate vs. 15% for 0 reassignments).
  - Tickets assigned to agents without required skills (65% breach rate).
  - P2 tickets assigned during peak L2 workload hours (10 AM–12 PM).

> **Key Insight**: The root of SLA breaches is not ticket volume, but *assignment inefficiency* — mismatched skills, unnecessary escalations, and uneven workload distribution.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Using process mining’s diagnostic capabilities, I would trace assignment failures to these root causes:

### Root Cause 1: **Static Assignment Logic**
- Round-robin ignores skills, workload, and ticket complexity. Dispatcher rules lack intelligence.
- *Evidence*: Variant analysis shows tickets assigned via “round-robin” have 3x more reassignments than those manually assigned by experienced dispatchers.

### Root Cause 2: **Inaccurate Skill Profiles**
- Agent skills are self-reported or outdated. “App-CRM” may mean Salesforce for one agent, SAP for another.
- *Evidence*: Decision mining reveals that when “Required Skill” = “App-CRM” and “Agent Skill” = “App-CRM”, resolution time varies from 15 min to 4 hrs — indicating skill ambiguity.

### Root Cause 3: **Poor Initial Ticket Triage**
- L1 agents or automated categorization mislabel tickets. “Network” tickets tagged as “Software-App” lead to wrong skill assignment.
- *Evidence*: 40% of reassignments occur because the “Required Skill” changes after L1 analysis (e.g., from “App-CRM” to “Database-SQL”).

### Root Cause 4: **No Real-Time Workload Visibility**
- Dispatchers assign tickets without seeing agent queue depth or current task complexity.
- *Evidence*: SNA shows agents with 5+ concurrent tickets still receive new assignments, while idle agents are overlooked.

### Root Cause 5: **L1 Agent Under-Empowerment**
- L1 agents escalate due to lack of authority (e.g., can’t restart servers) or training (e.g., can’t interpret CRM error logs).
- *Evidence*: Variant analysis: Tickets with “L1 Work Duration <5 min” before escalation have 90% skill match — indicating premature escalation.

### Diagnostic Techniques:
- **Variant Analysis**: Compare “ideal path” tickets (L1  resolved) vs. “chaotic path” tickets (L1  L2  reassign  L2  resolved). Identify decision points (e.g., initial assignment, escalation trigger) where paths diverge.
- **Decision Mining**: Model escalation decisions using attributes like “L1 Agent Skill Match”, “Ticket Priority”, “L1 Work Duration”. Reveal rules like: “If L1 Work Duration > 20 min, escalate — even if skill matches”.

> **Conclusion**: Assignment inefficiencies stem from rigid rules, poor data (skills/ticket attributes), and lack of real-time context — not agent incompetence.

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

Here are three concrete, implementable strategies:

---

### **Strategy 1: Skill-Proficiency Weighted Routing**

- **Issue Addressed**: Skill mismatches and underutilization of specialists.
- **Process Mining Insight**: Analysis shows tickets assigned to agents with matching skills resolve 60% faster. Skill ambiguity causes reassignments.
- **Implementation**:
  - Enrich agent profiles with *proficiency levels* (e.g., “App-CRM: Expert”, “Networking-Firewall: Intermediate”) via historical performance data (e.g., resolution time, success rate).
  - Routing algorithm: Assign tickets to agents with matching skill + highest proficiency + lowest current workload.
  - *Data Required*: Historical ticket-agent performance per skill, real-time agent workload, proficiency scores (calibrated from past resolution success).
- **Expected Benefits**:
  - 30% reduction in reassignments.
  - 25% faster resolution for skill-matched tickets.
  - 20% increase in specialist utilization on high-value tasks.

---

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Escalation Triage for L1**

- **Issue Addressed**: Premature L1 escalations and false skill mismatches.
- **Process Mining Insight**: 55% of L1 escalations have skill matches; many are due to short work duration (<5 min), indicating lack of confidence or training.
- **Implementation**:
  - Build a predictive model (e.g., decision tree) using ticket attributes (category, description keywords, priority) and L1 agent skill to predict *probability of L1 resolution*.
  - If probability >70%, L1 agent is prompted with knowledge base articles and granted temporary privileges (e.g., server restart) to resolve.
  - If probability <30%, auto-escalate to L2 with required skill pre-identified.
  - *Data Required*: Historical L1 resolution outcomes, ticket text (for NLP keyword extraction), agent skill profiles.
- **Expected Benefits**:
  - 40% reduction in unnecessary escalations.
  - 15% improvement in L1 FCR rate.
  - 20% reduction in L2 workload for low-complexity tickets.

---

### **Strategy 3: Dynamic Workload-Aware Assignment with Tier Flexibility**

- **Issue Addressed**: Workload imbalance and idle time for specialists.
- **Process Mining Insight**: Workload distribution is highly skewed; specialists sit idle while L1 is overwhelmed.
- **Implementation**:
  - Real-time dashboard showing agent workload (tickets in progress, queue depth) and skill availability.
  - Algorithm assigns tickets based on: 
    - Required skill match.
    - Agent’s current workload (e.g., tickets <3).
    - Tier flexibility: Allow L2 agents to handle L1 overflow during peaks if skill matches.
  - *Data Required*: Real-time event stream (ticket status, agent activity), historical workload patterns, tier flexibility rules.
- **Expected Benefits**:
  - 50% reduction in agent idle time.
  - 30% decrease in assignment delays during peak hours.
  - 15% improvement in SLA compliance for P2/P3 tickets.

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### Simulation for Impact Evaluation:
- **Approach**: Use process simulation tools (e.g., Celonis, Disco) to model the current process and simulate proposed strategies.
  - *Inputs*: Mined process model, resource profiles (skills, capacity), historical arrival rates.
  - *Scenarios*: 
    - Baseline (current round-robin).
    - Strategy 1 (skill-weighted routing).
    - Strategy 2 + 3 combined.
  - *Outputs*: Predicted resolution times, SLA compliance rates, reassignment frequency, resource utilization.
- **Outcome**: Validate that Strategy 2 + 3 reduces avg. resolution time by 35% and SLA breaches by 50% before implementation.

### Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan:
Deploy a **Process Mining Dashboard** tracking:

- **KPIs**:
  - % Tickets assigned with skill match (target: >85%).
  - Avg. reassignments per ticket (target: <0.5).
  - L1 FCR rate (target: >50%).
  - Agent workload balance (Gini coefficient <0.3).
  - SLA compliance by priority (P2 target: >95%, P3: >90%).

- **Process Views**:
  - **Variant Explorer**: Monitor frequency of “ideal” vs. “reassignment-heavy” paths.
  - **Performance Heatmap**: Resolution time by agent-skill-ticket category.
  - **SNA Graph**: Real-time collaboration network to detect emerging bottlenecks.
  - **Conformance Checker**: Alert when assignment deviates from new rules (e.g., skill mismatch >10%).

- **Feedback Loop**: Monthly review of dashboard metrics to refine algorithms (e.g., adjust proficiency weights, update escalation thresholds).

> **Final Note**: This data-driven, iterative approach transforms resource assignment from a reactive, rule-of-thumb process into a proactive, optimized system — turning TechSolve’s event log from a record of problems into a blueprint for excellence.
