Here are the proposed opposite concepts and more general concepts for each of the given process mining concepts:

1. Automated Process Discovery:
    - Opposite concept: Manual Process Discovery (refers to the process of discovering business processes manually, without the aid of automated tools or algorithms)
    - More general concept: Process Discovery (encompasses both automated and manual methods of discovering business processes)

2. Predictive Monitoring:
    - Opposite concept: Reactive Monitoring (focuses on responding to process anomalies or deviations after they have occurred, rather than predicting and preventing them)
    - More general concept: Process Monitoring (includes both predictive and reactive approaches to monitoring business processes)

3. Bottom-up Discovery:
    - Opposite concept: Top-down Discovery (involves starting with high-level process models and then breaking them down into more detailed components)
    - More general concept: Process Discovery (as mentioned earlier, this encompasses both bottom-up and top-down approaches to discovering business processes)

4. Process Simulation:
    - Opposite concept: Process Prototyping (involves creating a physical or pilot version of a business process to test and refine it, rather than simulating it)
    - More general concept: Process Analysis (encompasses various methods, including simulation, prototyping, and analytical modeling, to analyze and improve business processes)

5. Process Efficiency:
    - Opposite concept: Process Inefficiency (refers to the presence of unnecessary steps, delays, or waste in a business process)
    - More general concept: Process Performance (includes various aspects of process performance, such as efficiency, effectiveness, and quality)

6. Real-time Monitoring:
    - Opposite concept: Batch Monitoring (involves monitoring business processes at regular intervals or in batches, rather than in real-time)
    - More general concept: Process Visibility (encompasses various approaches to gaining insight into business processes, including real-time, batch, and periodic monitoring)
