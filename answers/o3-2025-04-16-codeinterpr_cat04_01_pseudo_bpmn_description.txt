Below is a “walk-through” of the diagram written in plain language.  
For every node you will find:  

• WHAT is done in business terms  
• WHY it is done / what information it produces  
• HOW the outgoing and incoming arrows (gateways) behave  

----------------------------------------------------
1. Start Event  
   – A customer (internal or external) sends a request for a product or service.  
   – Triggers the whole process.

----------------------------------------------------
2. Task A – “Receive Customer Request”  
   WHAT: Sales or Customer-Service logs the request, captures basic data (customer ID, required items, due date, special wishes, etc.).  
   WHY: Creates the case record that all later tasks will work on.

----------------------------------------------------
3. XOR Gateway – “Check Request Type”  
   MEANING: Exclusive OR (only one path is taken).  
   Decision criterion = Is the request a “Standard” catalogue item, or does it need “Custom” engineering?  
   • Standard   go to B1  
   • Custom     go to B2  

----------------------------------------------------
4A. STANDARD branch  

4A-1. Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”  
      WHAT: Quick front-office checks (customer status, catalogue pricing rules, delivery terms).  
      WHY: Make sure it is a “normal” order that can be executed without engineering.

4A-2. AND Gateway – “Run Parallel Checks” (parallel split)  
      MEANING: Both outgoing tasks C1 and C2 start at the same time; the process must wait for both to finish before moving on (parallel join).

      • Task C1 – “Credit Check”  
        WHAT: Finance system verifies credit limit, outstanding balance, etc.

      • Task C2 – “Inventory Check”  
        WHAT: Warehouse / MRP system checks current stock and allocates items.

4A-3. AND Join (implicit in the model) – “All Parallel Checks Completed”  
      Process pauses here until BOTH C1 and C2 return an OK (or an escalation if one of them fails).

4A-4. Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”  
      WHAT: Using lead times and inventory results, logistics computes the earliest reliable shipping date.  
      WHY: Needed for quotation, invoice and customer confirmation.

----------------------------------------------------
4B. CUSTOM branch  

4B-1. Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
      WHAT: Engineering and costing determine if the requested customisation is technically doable, within budget and time.  
  
4B-2. XOR Gateway – “Is Customisation Feasible?”  
      • If Yes   go to E1  
      • If No    go to E2 and END  

      • Task E1 – “Prepare Custom Quotation”  
        WHAT: Engineering, costing and sales create a price, target delivery date, bill of materials, etc.  
        WHY: Becomes the commercial offer that might require manager approval later.

      • Task E2 – “Send Rejection Notice”  
        WHAT: Inform customer politely that the company cannot satisfy the request.  
        End Event reached – the process stops for this case.

----------------------------------------------------
5. XOR Gateway – “Is Approval Needed?”  
   This node is reached from two different origins:  
   • Standard path right after Task D  
   • Custom path right after Task E1  

   Business rule examples:  
   – Order value exceeds $50 000  
   – Delivery date shorter than standard SLA  
   – First order from new customer  
   If the rule fires, the “Yes” branch is taken.

----------------------------------------------------
6A. If approval IS needed  

6A-1. Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval”  
       Could be a workflow task or e-mail to a line manager / finance director.

6A-2. XOR Gateway – “Is Approval Granted?”  
       • Yes   Task G  
       • No    Task H  

       • Task G – “Generate Final Invoice”  
         WHAT: ERP issues the official order confirmation / invoice (or pro-forma).  
         WHY: Financial document needed before shipping or starting production.

       • Task H – “Re-evaluate Conditions”  
         WHAT: Sales must adjust price, delivery date or scope to satisfy management.  
         LOOP:  
           – If the request was CUSTOM  go back to Task E1 to update quotation.  
           – If the request was STANDARD  go back to Task D (e.g., choose later delivery, partial shipment, different warehouse).  
         This loop continues until approval is granted or the customer abandons the request (not modelled here).

----------------------------------------------------
6B. If approval is NOT needed  

   Directly execute Task G – “Generate Final Invoice” (same description as above).

----------------------------------------------------
7. Task I – “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
   WHAT: E-mail / portal update containing order number, agreed price and delivery details.  
   WHY: Closes the sales cycle and triggers downstream fulfilment processes (picking, production, etc.).

----------------------------------------------------
8. End Event  
   Process instance is complete.

====================================================
Key Points Summarised
----------------------------------------------------
• XOR gateways (rhombus with X) choose exactly one path based on a rule or decision.  
• AND gateways (rhombus with + or no marker in some notations) launch activities in parallel and force the process to wait for all of them to finish (AND-join).  
• Standard vs. Custom fundamentally changes early tasks:  
  – Standard: quick validation + parallel operational checks, delivery date calculation.  
  – Custom: engineering feasibility first, possible early exit if impossible, then detailed quotation.  
• Approval logic is independent of Standard/Custom; it sits after those preparatory steps.  
• Rework loop is only triggered when:  
  1. Approval is required AND  
  2. The manager rejects.  
  The loop returns to the last point where commercial/operational parameters can be altered (E1 or D).  
• A rejection in the Custom feasibility step (E2) ends the process immediately and does NOT go through approval.

This explanation should enable anyone reading the pseudo-diagram to understand how each activity, decision and loop contributes to delivering (or rejecting) a customer’s request in the most suitable way.
