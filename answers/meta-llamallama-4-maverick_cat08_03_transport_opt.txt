### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

#### Preprocessing and Integration of Data

To create a cohesive event log for process mining, we need to integrate data from various sources: GPS trackers, driver handheld scanners, the dispatch system, and maintenance logs. Here's a step-by-step approach to preprocess and integrate this data:

*   **Data Cleaning:** Remove any duplicate or irrelevant records from each data source. For instance, GPS data points with implausible speeds or locations outside the operational area should be filtered out.
*   **Data Transformation:** Convert all timestamps to a uniform format (e.g., UTC) to ensure consistency across different data sources. Geographical coordinates from GPS data should be transformed into a suitable format for analysis, such as using a Geographic Information System (GIS) to map locations.
*   **Data Integration:** Merge events from different sources based on their timestamps and Vehicle ID/Driver ID. For example, 'Depart Customer' events from scanners can be correlated with the subsequent GPS location and speed data to analyze post-delivery travel behavior.
*   **Case ID Creation:** Assign a unique 'Case ID' to each vehicle's operational day (e.g., V12-20241205) to trace the sequence of events for process mining.

**Challenges:**

*   **Data Quality Issues:** Inaccurate or missing timestamps, inconsistent event types, or incorrect vehicle/driver IDs can hinder the integration process.
*   **Data Volume:** Handling large volumes of GPS data (potentially one record per second) can be challenging and may require scalable data processing solutions.

#### Process Discovery

Process discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner, Heuristics Miner) can be applied to the integrated event log to visualize the actual end-to-end delivery process. The discovered process model will illustrate the sequence of activities, including:

*   Departure from and arrival at the depot.
*   Delivery attempts (successful and failed).
*   Travel between stops.
*   Unplanned stops or maintenance events.

The process model will help identify the variability in the delivery process and potential deviations from the planned route or schedule.

#### Conformance Checking

To compare the actual process against planned routes from the dispatch system, conformance checking techniques can be employed. This involves:

*   **Aligning Actual and Planned Processes:** Compare the discovered process model with the planned routes to identify deviations in sequence, timing, or activities.
*   **Deviations Analysis:** Look for specific types of deviations such as:
    *   Unplanned stops or detours.
    *   Significant timing differences between planned and actual arrival/departure times.
    *   Sequence deviations (e.g., delivering packages out of the planned order).

Conformance checking will highlight areas where the actual delivery process diverges from the planned process, indicating potential inefficiencies or issues.

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Relevant KPIs for Speedy Parcels include:

*   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of deliveries made within the promised time window.
*   **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Total time spent at delivery stops divided by the number of stops.
*   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Comparison of time spent traveling between stops versus time spent at stops.
*   **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Measure of fuel efficiency in relation to distance traveled and packages delivered.
*   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Percentage of vehicle capacity utilized for deliveries.
*   **Frequency and Duration of Traffic Delays:** Analysis of how often and for how long vehicles are delayed due to traffic.
*   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Percentage of delivery attempts that fail.

These KPIs can be calculated from the event log by analyzing timestamps, locations, and event types.

#### Bottleneck Identification

Process mining techniques such as:

*   **Performance Analysis:** Analyze the duration of different activities (e.g., travel, delivery attempts) and identify bottlenecks.
*   **Bottleneck Analysis:** Use techniques like animation or frequency analysis to pinpoint where and when delays occur.

Bottlenecks might be related to:

*   Specific routes or road segments prone to traffic congestion.
*   High variability in service times at customer locations.
*   Inefficient routing or sequencing of delivery stops.
*   Driver behavior or skill differences.

Quantifying the impact of these bottlenecks involves calculating the additional time or cost incurred due to these inefficiencies.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

#### Potential Root Causes

Beyond identifying where delays and high costs occur, potential root causes include:

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Static routing that doesn't account for real-time traffic or dynamic conditions.
*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:** Underestimating travel times between stops, leading to unrealistic schedules.
*   **Traffic Congestion Patterns:** Unpredictable or recurring traffic congestion affecting travel times.
*   **Variability in Service Time:** Differences in the time taken to complete deliveries at customer locations.
*   **Vehicle Breakdowns or Maintenance:** Unscheduled maintenance or breakdowns disrupting delivery schedules.
*   **Driver Behavior or Skill Differences:** Variations in how drivers navigate routes, interact with customers, or handle packages.

#### Process Mining Analyses for Root Cause Validation

*   **Variant Analysis:** Compare high-performing vs. low-performing routes or drivers to identify best practices or areas for improvement.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Correlate traffic data with delays to understand the impact of congestion.
*   **Dwell Time Analysis:** Analyze the time spent at delivery stops to identify patterns or anomalies.

These analyses can help validate the root causes of inefficiencies and guide the development of targeted optimization strategies.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

1.  **Dynamic Routing Adjustments:** Implement real-time routing adjustments based on traffic data and process insights. This targets inefficiencies caused by traffic congestion and suboptimal static routing.

    *   **Root Cause:** Suboptimal route planning and traffic congestion.
    *   **Process Mining Insights:** Analysis of traffic-related delays and route deviations.
    *   **Expected Impact:** Improved on-time delivery rates and reduced fuel consumption.

2.  **Optimized Delivery Territories/Route Sequences:** Use historical performance data to optimize delivery territories and route sequences. This addresses inefficiencies related to routing and sequencing.

    *   **Root Cause:** Inefficient routing and sequencing.
    *   **Process Mining Insights:** Analysis of travel times, service times, and delivery sequences.
    *   **Expected Impact:** Reduced travel times and improved vehicle utilization.

3.  **Predictive Maintenance Schedules:** Develop predictive maintenance schedules based on vehicle usage patterns. This targets the root cause of unscheduled maintenance and breakdowns.

    *   **Root Cause:** Unscheduled maintenance and vehicle breakdowns.
    *   **Process Mining Insights:** Analysis of vehicle usage patterns and maintenance logs.
    *   **Expected Impact:** Reduced downtime due to maintenance and lower maintenance costs.

### 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

#### Operational Constraints

When implementing optimization strategies, consider operational constraints such as:

*   Driver working hours and regulations.
*   Vehicle capacities and types.
*   Customer time windows and preferences.

These constraints should be integrated into the optimization models to ensure feasibility and compliance.

#### Continuous Monitoring

To ensure the sustainability of optimizations and quickly identify emerging issues, establish a continuous monitoring plan using process mining dashboards. Track key metrics such as:

*   On-time delivery rates.
*   Fuel consumption and emissions.
*   Vehicle utilization rates.
*   Driver performance metrics.

Regularly review process views and performance data to:

*   Validate the effectiveness of implemented optimizations.
*   Identify new bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
*   Adjust strategies as operational conditions or customer needs evolve.

By continuously monitoring the delivery process and adapting to insights from process mining, Speedy Parcels can maintain high levels of efficiency and customer satisfaction.
