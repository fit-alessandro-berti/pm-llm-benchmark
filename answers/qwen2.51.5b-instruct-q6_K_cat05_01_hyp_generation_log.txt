Sure, I will structure my response around identifying anomalies, hypothesizing possible reasons for these anomalies, proposing SQL queries to investigate these issues, and ensuring the queries are as detailed and specific as possible. Here is a sample outline:

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Anomalies:**
   - Examine patterns in `order_event_log` that deviate significantly from expected behavior.
   - Look for unusual timestamps or activity sequences.

2. **Hypothesize Reasons:**
   - Consider potential issues such as system errors, policy violations, training problems, etc.
   - For example:
     - A credit check might be delayed because the finance team is on vacation.
     - The warehouse might not receive shipments on time due to stock shortages.

3. **Propose SQL Queries:**

4. **Query 1: Check for Delayed Credit Checks**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       event_id,
       resource,
       case_id, 
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, MIN(timestamp), MAX(timestamp)) AS delay_minutes
   FROM 
       order_event_log
   WHERE 
       activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
   GROUP BY 
       event_id, resource, case_id;
   ```

5. **Query 2: Identify Orders with Unexpected Shipment Status**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       o.case_id,
       o.customer_id,
       o.order_type,
       o.order_value,
       re.role AS resource_role,
       te.activity AS expected_activity,
       e.activity AS actual_activity
   FROM 
       order_event_log o
   INNER JOIN 
       orders r ON o.case_id = r.case_id
   INNER JOIN 
       resources re ON o.resource = re.resource_id
   LEFT JOIN 
       `order_event_log` te ON o.case_id = te.case_id AND te.activity LIKE 'Confirm Shipment%' AND te.resource IN ('WarehouseClerk_1', 'WarehouseClerk_2')
   LEFT JOIN 
       order_event_log e ON r.case_id = e.case_id AND e.activity = 'Ship Goods';
   ```

6. **Query 3: Find Orders with Unusual Shipping Times**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       o.case_id,
       SUM(TO_TIMESTAMP(e.timestamp) - TO_TIMESTAMP(o.ts)) AS shipment_delay_in_days
   FROM 
       order_event_log o
   INNER JOIN 
       order_event_log e ON e.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND e.resource IN ('WarehouseClerk_1', 'WarehouseClerk_2')
   WHERE 
       o.order_type = 'standard'
   GROUP BY 
       o.case_id;
   ```

7. **Query 4: Track Orders with Multiple Shipment Approvals**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       case_id,
       customer_id,
       order_type,
       MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP(event_log.timestamp)) AS latest_shipment_time
   FROM 
       order_event_log event_log
   WHERE 
       activity = 'Ship Goods'
   GROUP BY 
       case_id, customer_id, order_type;
   ```

8. **Query 5: Review Orders with Unusual Invoice Handling**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       o.case_id,
       SUM(TO_TIMESTAMP(e.timestamp) - TO_TIMESTAMP(o.ts)) AS invoice_delay_in_days
   FROM 
       order_event_log o
   INNER JOIN 
       order_event_log e ON e.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND e.resource IN ('FinanceTeam_01', 'FinanceTeam_02')
   WHERE 
       o.order_type = 'priority'
   GROUP BY 
       o.case_id;
   ```

---

### Additional Considerations

- **Check for Unusual Activity Patterns:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count
  FROM 
      order_event_log
  WHERE 
      TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, MIN(timestamp), MAX(timestamp)) >= 24;
  ```

- **Review Specific Resource Usage Patterns:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      r.resource_id,
      SUM(TO_TIMESTAMP(e.timestamp) - TO_TIMESTAMP(o.ts)) AS resource_usage_minutes
  FROM 
      order_event_log o
  INNER JOIN 
      resources r ON o.resource = r.resource_id
  WHERE 
      o.activity LIKE 'Ship Goods%'
  GROUP BY 
      r.resource_id;
  ```

These queries should provide a comprehensive view of the event logs and help identify potential issues that require further investigation.
