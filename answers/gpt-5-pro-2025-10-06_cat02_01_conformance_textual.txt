Summary of the intended rules (interpreting the text strictly):
- Start with Receive order.
- Check inventory must occur before any payment or fulfillment actions.
- If sufficient inventory (fulfillment path): Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order. All steps are mandatory and in this order.
- If insufficient inventory (cancellation path): Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order. No packaging or shipping after cancellation.
- Ship order must never occur after cancellation, and Close order must be last.

Violating cases:
- Case 2:
  - Package items occurs before Authorize payment. This violates “Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping,” and “Authorize payment should occur before packaging.”
- Case 3:
  - Authorize payment occurs, then the case goes to Cancel order. In the cancellation scenario (implied by the presence of Cancel order after the inventory check), payment authorization should not occur; the prescribed path is Check  Cancel  Close.
  - Ship order happens after Cancel order, which is explicitly disallowed (“Ship order should … never [occur] after a cancellation”).
  - Ship order occurs without any prior Package items, violating “Ship order should only occur after packaging.”
- Case 5:
  - Ship order occurs without any Package items step, violating “Ship order should only occur after packaging.” In the fulfillment path, packaging is mandatory between authorization and shipping.

Conforming cases:
- Case 1: Follows the full fulfillment path in the correct order.
- Case 4: Follows the cancellation path (Check  Cancel  Close) correctly.
