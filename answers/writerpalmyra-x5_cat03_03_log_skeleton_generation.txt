### Notes:
- **Equivalence:** Assumes that every order received leads to an invoice, and every dispatch eventually has its payment recorded — hence those pairs occur equally.
- **Always Before / Always After:** Enforce the correct sequential flow of the fulfillment pipeline.
- **Never Together:** Certain activity pairs like *Check Availability* and *Reserve Items* may not occur in the same case if automated, but here we assume they should not appear **without** intermediate logic — though more context might refine this. Alternatively, this could model mutually exclusive paths, but in this standard flow, they’re kept as possibly redundant or indicative of deviation if both occur without proper order. *(Clarification may be needed based on real logs — currently interpreted as potential anomalies if co-occurring without proper sequence.)*
- **Activity Frequency:** Each activity is expected to occur exactly once per case.
- **Directly-Follows:** Captures the strict, immediate sequence from order receipt through dispatch.

Let me know if you'd like to model alternative scenarios (e.g., rework loops, cancellations, or variable frequencies).
