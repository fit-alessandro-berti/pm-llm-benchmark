**Explanation:**

The logic for grouping events into cases is based on the context provided by the application names and window titles. For instance, when the user switches between different documents within Microsoft Word or interacts with the same application with different windows, it suggests that they are working on separate tasks.

- **Case C1:** This case starts with the user focusing on the "Quarterly_Report.docx". After drafting this report, they switch to "Document1.docx" for additional writing and then handle an email related to an annual meeting. They switch again to review a PDF document ("Report_Draft.pdf") and return to edit their quarterly report.

- **Case C2:** This case starts with the user opening and editing "Budget_2024.xlsx", and then switching back to "Document1.docx" to include references to the budget details before finally closing the document.

The activity names are derived from the context of the actions and applications involved. For example, "Editing Quarterly Report" is an interpretation of focusing on a specific document within Microsoft Word, while "Drafting Document 1" is based on the user starting to type in "Document1.docx".

This transformation assumes that each switch between different windows within the same application indicates a change in the task being worked on, whereas switches between different applications generally indicate a shift to a completely different task.
