## Process Model: Invoice Approval Workflow

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval and Payment Scheduling
**Primary Lanes (Pools):** Accounts Payable (AP), Purchasing Department, Department Manager, AP Supervisor (Exception Handling)
**External Interaction:** Supplier, Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)

### 1. Initialization and Initial Screening (Accounts Payable)

| Step ID | Role/Lane | Activity/Event | Artifacts Involved | Next Step/Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start** | AP | **Start Event:** Invoice Received (Typically via Email) | Invoice | A1 |
| A1 | AP (Mary) | **Task:** Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number | Invoice, PO | [Gateway 1] |

### 2. PO Existence Gateway & Initial Exception Handling

**[Gateway 1: Exclusive (XOR)] - PO Status Check**

*   **Path 1 (No PO):**
    *   A2.1: **Task:** Request PO/Details from Supplier.
    *   A2.2: **Task:** Escalate Missing Info to AP Supervisor (If initial contact fails/complex case). (Rita intervenes to coordinate with Supplier/SRM).
    *   *Flow:** Once PO is obtained/validated, proceeds to A3.
*   **Path 2 (PO Exists):**
    *   A3: **Task:** Log Invoice into Accounting System.
    *   A4: **Task:** Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department.
    *   *Flow:* Proceed to Purchasing Verification.

### 3. Purchasing Verification (Purchasing Department)

| Step ID | Role/Lane | Activity/Event | Artifacts Involved | Next Step/Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A5 | Purchasing (Dan) | **Task:** Verify Invoice details against PO (Quantities, Prices, Delivery Charges) | Invoice, PO | [Gateway 2] |

### 4. Matching Gateway & Discrepancy Handling

**[Gateway 2: Exclusive (XOR)] - Match Verification**

*   **Path 2a (Match Confirmed):**
    *   A6a: **Task:** Send Confirmation Email back to AP.
    *   *Flow:* Proceeds to AP Matching (A7).
*   **Path 2b (Discrepancy Found):**
    *   A6b.1: **Task:** Attempt Resolution (Contact Supplier directly OR Ask AP to hold invoice pending correction).
    *   A6b.2: **Exception Flow:** If discrepancy is complex or cannot be resolved by Purchasing: Escalate issue to AP Clerk (Mary) for clarification/Supervisor review.
    *   *Flow:* After resolution, returns to **A5** (Re-verification) OR proceeds to **A7** if resolved sufficiently for initial system matching.

### 5. AP Reconciliation and Pre-Approval Check

| Step ID | Role/Lane | Activity/Event | Artifacts Involved | Next Step/Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A7 | AP (Mary) | **Task:** Match Invoice Line Items against PO in System (Requires Purchasing Confirmation) | Invoice, PO data | [Gateway 3] |

**[Gateway 3: Exclusive (XOR)] - AP Matching Result**

*   **Path 3a (Match OK):**
    *   A8: **Task:** System automatically generates Notification/Request to Manager.
    *   *Flow:* Proceeds to Manager Approval (A9).
*   **Path 3b (Discrepancy Found during Matching):**
    *   A8b.1: **Task:** Email Purchasing Team to Clarify. (If issues are minor/unresolved, Mary escalates to Supervisor Rita).
    *   *Flow:* If escalation occurs, the process enters the **Supervisor Exception Loop** (See Section 6) before returning to **A7** or **A9** upon resolution.

### 6. Supervisor Exception Handling (AP Supervisor / SRM Involvement)

*This path is triggered when Mary cannot resolve a discrepancy or when an invoice lacks a PO.*

| Step ID | Role/Lane | Activity/Event | Artifacts Involved | Next Step/Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| E1 | AP Supervisor (Rita) | **Task:** Coordinate Resolution (Contact Supplier/SRM, or create retrospective PO if no PO exists). | Supplier Contracts (SRM input) | E2 |
| E2 | AP Supervisor/SRM (Karen) | **Task:** Supplier Consultation/Contract Check (SRM confirms agreed terms/pricing). | Contract Data | E3 |
| E3 | AP Supervisor (Rita) | **Task:** Finalize exception resolution. | Updated Invoice/Notes | **Return Flow:** Return to **A7** (Re-match) or **A9** (If resolution clears path for Manager Approval). |

### 7. Manager Approval and Finalization

| Step ID | Role/Lane | Activity/Event | Artifacts Involved | Next Step/Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A9 | Manager (Carlos) | **Task:** Review Invoice, PO, and Confirmation Data | Approval Data Set | [Gateway 4] |

**[Gateway 4: Exclusive (XOR)] - Manager Decision**

*   **Path 4a (Approved):**
    *   A10: **Task:** Schedule Invoice for Payment Run (System/AP).
    *   **End Event:** Payment Scheduled.
*   **Path 4b (Suspicious/Rejected):**
    *   A10b: **Task:** Place Invoice on Hold and Initiate Investigation (Instructs AP Clerk Mary).
    *   *Flow:* Returns to **A7** or potentially involves the **Supervisor Exception Loop (E1)** if the investigation reveals complexity.
