### Explanation of Transformation Logic

#### Case Identification
- **Case Grouping:** Cases are identified based on the specific resource or document the user interacts with. Each unique document or task context (e.g., a Word document, email inbox, PDF, or spreadsheet) defines a "case." This reflects a logical unit of work, such as drafting a document or handling an email.
  - `Case_Document1`: Events related to "Document1.docx."
  - `Case_Email`: Events related to email activities in "Email - Inbox."
  - `Case_Report_Draft`: Events related to "Report_Draft.pdf."
  - `Case_Budget_2024`: Events related to "Budget_2024.xlsx."
  - `Case_Quarterly`: Events related to "Quarterly_Report.docx."
- **Temporal Context:** Events are grouped by their sequence and proximity in time, ensuring that switches between applications (e.g., via "SWITCH" actions) separate distinct cases. For example, returning to "Document1.docx" after working on other tasks is treated as a continuation of the same case.

#### Activity Naming
- **Standardization:** Low-level actions (e.g., "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SWITCH") are translated into higher-level, analyst-friendly activity names based on their context and purpose:
  - "FOCUS" → "Open Document," "Open Spreadsheet," or "Reopen Document" (if revisited).
  - "TYPING" → "Edit Document," "Edit Spreadsheet," or "Edit Email Reply."
  - "SAVE" → "Save Document" or "Save Spreadsheet."
  - "CLICK" and "SCROLL" → Contextual activities like "Read Email," "Review Email Content," or "Compose Email Reply."
  - "HIGHLIGHT" → "Annotate PDF Document."
  - "CLOSE" → "Close Document."
- **Consistency:** Similar actions across different applications (e.g., editing in Word vs. Excel) are named consistently where possible (e.g., "Edit Document" vs. "Edit Spreadsheet") to reflect the resource type.

#### Event Attributes
- **Case ID:** Derived from the resource or task (e.g., "Case_Document1" for "Document1.docx").
- **Activity Name:** Descriptive and standardized as described above.
- **Timestamp:** Retained from the original log.
- **Additional Attributes:** Added "Application" and "Resource/Document" to provide context for process analysis.

#### Coherent Narrative
The event log captures distinct work sessions:
- Drafting and saving "Document1.docx," pausing, then revisiting it.
- Handling an email (reading, replying, sending).
- Reviewing and annotating a PDF report.
- Updating and saving a budget spreadsheet.
- Working on "Quarterly_Report.docx" at the start and end of the session.

This structure allows analysts to trace the user’s workflow across tasks, identify bottlenecks (e.g., frequent switching), and analyze task completion times.
