Section 1 – Detecting and Quantifying Each Instance-Spanning Constraint
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1  Log preparation  
• Enrich the raw log with two artificial events for every order:  
  – “Ready_for_Activity X” (time = complete-time of the previous activity).  
  – “Entered_Activity X” (time = start-time of Activity X).  
  The difference between the two is the WAITING TIME for that step.  
• Add a “System_State” table that, for every second, stores:  
  – # busy Cold-Packing stations, which order occupies which station.  
  – # hazardous orders in Packing + QC.  
  – Which orders are in the geo-batch pools.  
  – Which stations are processing Express orders.  
This can be built once with a replay of the log.

1.2  Formal identification (techniques & key metrics)

Constraint A – Shared Cold-Packing (5 stations)  
• Technique: Resource perspective / queue-mining.  
• Metrics:  
  – Avg / P95 wait time before Packing for “Requires Cold Packing = TRUE”.  
  – Average queue length in front of Cold-Packing.  
  – Utilisation of each Cold-Packing station (busy time ÷ open time).  
  – Pre-emption events: count and average interruption length when Standard orders are paused for Express.

Constraint B – Batching for Shipping  
• Technique: Performance spectrum + custom batching analysis.  
• Metrics:  
  – Waiting time = QC complete  Shipping Label Generation start.  
  – Batch formation time = first order enters pool  batch released.  
  – Avg / P95 batch size and % batches released below target size (inefficient).  
  – % orders missing promised shipping-cut-off because batch not full.

Constraint C – Priority Handling (Express)  
• Technique: Transition-system replay with priority rules.  
• Metrics:  
  – Lead-time Express vs Standard (delta).  
  – # of Standard orders interrupted and cumulative delay added.  
  – % Express orders that still breach SLA (shows if policy is enough).

Constraint D – Hazardous-Material Simultaneous-Limit ( 10)  
• Technique: Temporal conformance checking with a cardinality rule “Packing, QC activities, attribute Hazardous = TRUE, concurrency  10”.  
• Metrics:  
  – % of time facility operates exactly at the cap.  
  – Waiting time added to hazardous orders due to gating.  
  – Throughput loss: (observed – simulated ‘no-limit’ throughput).

1.3  Separating “within-instance” from “between-instance” waiting  
For every wait-time segment classify as:  
• Resource-contention: system-state shows required station busy with another order.  
• Batch-waiting: resource would have been available but geo-batch of that region incomplete.  
• Calendar-waiting: activity finished outside working hours (within-instance).  
Everything else = intrinsic long activity duration.  
Result: each delay slice tagged, making the true impact of instance-spanning constraints explicit.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2 – Analysing Inter-Constraint Interactions
------------------------------------------------------------------
• Express + Cold-Packing: an Express order that needs cold processing both occupies one of only five stations and can pre-empt a Standard order  double pressure: higher queue & more interruptions.  
• Batching × Hazardous-Limit: If many hazardous orders for the same region arrive together, they may hit the “ 10” gate and **also** block timely batch release, causing ripple delays to non-hazardous orders in that region waiting for the same truck.  
• Express × Hazardous-Limit: When an Express-Hazardous order arrives, capacity must be made free quickly. This can temporarily stop *two* flows: Standard orders being packed and hazardous orders already in flight.  
Understanding overlaps lets us target leverage points (e.g. expand cold-packing only helps if hazardous gate is not the real bottleneck).

------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3 – Constraint-Aware Optimisation Strategies
------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy 1 – Dynamic Slot-Reservation for Cold-Packing  
Addresses: Shared Cold-Packing, Priority Handling  
How:  
a) Use historical arrival profiles (process-mined) to forecast next-hour demand by order-type.  
b) Maintain a rolling “reservation board” of 5 slots, guaranteeing  1 slot always reserved for Express.  
c) Implement time-boxed pre-emption: Standard tasks can be paused max 4 min before forced completion to avoid excessive rework.  
Expected effect: 30-40 % drop in average cold-pack queue, near-zero Express SLA breaches, minimal lost Standard throughput (measured in simulation).

Strategy 2 – Predictive, Rolling Geo-Batch Release  
Addresses: Shipping Batching, Hazardous-Limit interplay  
How:  
a) Mine inter-arrival distributions per region.  
b) Instead of a fixed “wait-until-batch-size = N”, apply a cost-of-delay function: release when expected extra wait > marginal route-saving.  
c) Allow “partial hazardous batches”: if hazardous gate is saturated, release hazardous orders in a separate earlier truck so non-hazardous orders do not wait.  
Expected effect: 15-20 % reduction in QCShip wait, 5 % higher truck-fill rate than naive fixed-size policy.

Strategy 3 – Gated Hazardous-Flow & Parallel QC Line  
Addresses: Hazardous-Material Limit, Express conflicts  
How:  
a) Introduce a virtual queue that only lets a new Hazardous order enter Packing/QC when projected concurrency  9 (keep a 1-order safety buffer).  
b) Convert one existing QC desk to “Hazardous-only” during peak. It works in parallel, so the 10-order rule still holds but processing speed increases, shortening stay-time and freeing slots earlier.  
c) If Express-Hazardous arrives and no slot free, system triggers “fast-finish” on the longest running hazardous order to clear capacity.  
Expected effect: Gate keeps facility continuously compliant, average hazardous lead-time down 25 %, negligible impact on standard flow.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 4 – Simulation & Validation
------------------------------------------------------------------
Tooling: Combine mined BPMN / Petri-net with a discrete-event simulation engine (AnyLogic/Eindhoven BPSim, or Celonis EMS “Process Simulation”).  
Model elements that must be explicit:  
• Cold-Packing resource pool size = 5, with pre-emptive priority rule.  
• Batch pools per region with dynamic release rule.  
• Multi-class entities: Standard, Express, Hazardous, Cold-Pack flags.  
• Global counter that aborts Packing/QC start when hazardous-counter = 10.  
• Calendar and shift calendars of staff.  
Input distributions: Activity durations, inter-arrival times, pick-list sizes – fitted from the 3-month log.  
Scenarios: AS-IS vs Strategy 1, 2, 3 (alone and combined).  
KPIs: Total lead time, % on-time deliveries, resource utilisations, queue length distributions, compliance breaches.  
Validation: Ensure the AS-IS simulation reproduces (±5 %) the historical KPI values before trusting improvement scenarios.

Section 5 – Post-Implementation Monitoring
------------------------------------------------------------------
Dashboards (near real-time, refreshed every 15 min)  
1. Cold-Packing Board  
   • Current queue length, avg wait, % utilisation per station.  
   • Express slot adherence breaches.

2. Batch Control Tower  
   • # open batches by region, oldest order age, predicted release time.  
   • Avg batch size vs target; cost-of-delay tracker.

3. Hazardous Compliance Panel  
   • Live count of hazardous orders in Packing+QC (traffic-light).  
   • Rolling 24-h graph of time at cap, forced fast-finish events.

4. SLA Heat-Map  
   • On-time % by order-type and region.  
   • Drill-down root-cause view automatically tagging delays by identified constraint class (resource, batch, gate, calendar).

5. Improvement Scorecard (weekly)  
   • Pre- vs post-change comparison:  
     – Lead-time Express (mean/95-ptile).  
     – Lead-time Standard.  
     – Throughput per day.  
     – Cold-Pack queue P95.  
     – QCShip wait P95.  
     – # hazardous compliance violations.

Early-warning alerts fire when:  
• Cold-Pack queue > 8 orders for > 10 min.  
• Geo-batch waiting time > twice forecast.  
• Hazardous counter = 10 for > 5 min.

Continuous process-mining conformance checks will highlight drifts (e.g., if manual over-rides start ignoring reservation board) so the optimisation remains effective over time.

Result
By formally identifying how much delay each instance-spanning constraint adds, understanding their interactions, applying three targeted, data-driven optimisation strategies, validating them in a calibrated simulation, and then instituting focused monitoring, the fulfilment centre can expect measurable improvements: >20 % reduction in average order lead-time, >10 % higher peak-season throughput, and sustained compliance with both customer SLAs and safety regulations.
