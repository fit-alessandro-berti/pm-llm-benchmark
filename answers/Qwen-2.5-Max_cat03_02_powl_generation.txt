Below is the Python code that constructs the POWL model for the described digital service provisioning process. The code uses the `pm4py` library to define transitions, operators (loop and exclusive choice), and partial orders.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Define all transitions (activities)
SR = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Step 2: Define the loop for Base Network Configuration and Debug & Reconfigure
loop_BNC_DR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Step 3: Define the exclusive choice for deployment methods
xor_CD_MD = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 4: Define the partial order for QA and SA
partial_order_QA_SA = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
partial_order_QA_SA.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)  # QA must complete before GLA
partial_order_QA_SA.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)  # SA must complete before GLA

# Step 5: Define the main partial order for the entire process
main_partial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop_BNC_DR, xor_CD_MD, partial_order_QA_SA])

# Add edges to enforce the correct execution order
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # Service Request Verification must precede Contract Setup
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(CS, DA)  # Contract Setup must precede Datacenter Allocation
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)  # Contract Setup must precede Access Control Initialization
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(DA, loop_BNC_DR)  # Datacenter Allocation must precede the configuration loop
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_BNC_DR)  # Access Control Initialization must precede the configuration loop
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(loop_BNC_DR, xor_CD_MD)  # Configuration loop must precede deployment choice
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(xor_CD_MD, partial_order_QA_SA)  # Deployment choice must precede QA/SA

# Final POWL model
powl_model = main_partial_order

# Print the constructed POWL model (optional)
print(powl_model)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Transitions**:
   - Each activity in the process is represented as a `Transition` object with an appropriate label.
   - Activities like "Service Request Verification" (`SR`) and "Contract Setup" (`CS`) are mandatory steps.

2. **Loop Node**:
   - The loop between "Base Network Configuration" (`BNC`) and "Debug & Reconfigure" (`DR`) is modeled using `OperatorPOWL` with the `LOOP` operator.

3. **Exclusive Choice**:
   - The choice between "Containerized Deployment" (`CD`) and "Monolithic Deployment" (`MD`) is modeled using `OperatorPOWL` with the `XOR` operator.

4. **Partial Orders**:
   - The tasks "Quality Assurance" (`QA`) and "Security Audit" (`SA`) are modeled as a `StrictPartialOrder` where both tasks must complete before "Go-Live Approval" (`GLA`). This is enforced by adding edges from `QA` and `SA` to `GLA`.

5. **Main Partial Order**:
   - The overall process is represented as a `StrictPartialOrder` that links all components (transitions, loops, choices, and sub-partial orders) in the correct sequence.

6. **Dependencies**:
   - Edges are added to enforce dependencies, such as ensuring that `CS` must complete before `DA` and `ACI`, and that `loop_BNC_DR` must complete before `xor_CD_MD`.

### Key Features:
- **Concurrency**: Tasks like `DA` and `ACI` are modeled as concurrent activities since they have no ordering constraints between them.
- **Loops**: The repeated configuration phase (`BNC` followed by optional `DR`) is captured using the `LOOP` operator.
- **Exclusive Choice**: The deployment method selection (`CD` or `MD`) is modeled using the `XOR` operator.
- **Final Partial Order**: The final tasks (`QA`, `SA`, and `GLA`) are linked using a partial order to ensure proper sequencing.

This code faithfully represents the described scenario as a POWL model.
