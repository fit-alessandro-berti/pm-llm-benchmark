3. **[Task T2] Check invoice for PO number** – L2  
   - Action: Verify the invoice contains a PO number and that it appears syntactically valid.  
   - Output: Flag “PO present?” / candidate PO reference.

4. **[Exclusive Gateway G1] PO number present and valid?** – L2  
   - Condition:  
     - YES: Invoice has a PO number that appears to reference an existing PO.  
     - NO: No PO, or clearly invalid/lacking PO.

---

### 2.2 Standard PO-based Path (G1 = YES)

5. **[Task T3] Log invoice in accounting system** – L2  
   - Lane: AP Clerk.  
   - Inputs: Invoice, PO number.  
   - Output: Invoice record created in SYS (status: “Pending receipt confirmation”).

6. **[Task T4] Forward invoice to Purchasing for receipt confirmation** – L2  
   - Action: Send invoice (or workflow item) to Purchasing Officer.

7. **[Task T5] Verify receipt and basic PO/invoice consistency** – L3 (PO)  
   - Actions:  
     - Open PO and invoice.  
     - Check that goods/services were received and that quantities, prices, and delivery charges are broadly in line with the PO.  
   - Output: “Purchasing check result”.

8. **[Exclusive Gateway G2] Discrepancy identified by Purchasing?** – L3  
   - Condition: Differences in quantities, prices, delivery, or missing/incorrect PO reference.

#### 2.2.1 No discrepancy from Purchasing (G2 = NO)

9. **[Task T6] Send receipt/PO match confirmation to AP** – L3  
   - Output: Email/notification to AP: “OK – received and matches order”.

10. **[Task T7] Record purchasing confirmation** – L7 (SYS)  
    - Action: Update invoice status to “Receipt confirmed by Purchasing”.

11. **[Task T8] Perform detailed invoice-to-PO matching** – L2 (APC)  
    - Actions:

12. **[Exclusive Gateway G3] Invoice fully matches PO?** – L2  

   - **G3 = YES: continue to manager approval.**  
   - **G3 = NO: discrepancy detected by AP; go to AP discrepancy handling (2.2.3).**

---

#### 2.2.2 Manager Approval Path (G3 = YES)

13. **[Task T9] Trigger manager approval request** – L7 (SYS)  
    - Action: System automatically sends approval request to responsible Department Manager once:  
      - Receipt is confirmed (T7), and  
      - Invoice-to-PO match is successful (T8).

14. **[Task T10] Review invoice and PO for approval** – L6 (DM)  
    - Inputs: Invoice, PO, purchasing confirmation, any notes.

      - Clarify with Department Manager, Purchasing, Supplier, AP Supervisor, or SRM as needed.  
      - Determine whether corrections can be made (e.g., budget, coding, supporting documentation).

21. **[Exclusive Gateway G5] Can issue be resolved to allow payment?** – L2  
    - G5 = YES: correction possible.  
    - G5 = NO: invoice should be rejected.

   - **G5 = YES:**  
     - Depending on changes, AP may:  
       - Return to **T8** (re-perform detailed matching if financial/line-item data changed), and then repeat manager approval (**T9–T11**),  
       - Or, if only non-financial clarifications were needed, go directly back to **T9** (re-request manager approval).  
     - (Exact loop path is not fully specified in interviews; modeler may choose the stricter option of looping via T8.)

   - **G5 = NO:**  
     22. **[Task T15] Reject invoice and notify supplier** – L2  
         - Action: Inform supplier that invoice is rejected (reason: e.g., budget issue, unapproved spend).

    - Action: AP updates invoice record with corrected data.

28. **[Task T19] Update invoice/PO data and re-perform matching** – L2 (APC)  
    - Action: Repeat **T8** (detailed invoice-to-PO matching).  
    - Flow: Return to **G3** (Invoice fully matches PO?).

##### 2.2.3.2 Not easily resolved / blocked (G6 = NO)

29. **[Task T20] Escalate discrepancy to AP Supervisor** – L2 or L3  
    - Note: Interviews indicate both AP and Purchasing can escalate; for modeling, treat this as a single step where the case is assigned to APS.

30. **[Task T21] Coordinate resolution of problematic invoice** – L4 (APS)  
    - Actions:  
      - Communicate with Purchasing and Department heads.  
      - Contact Supplier directly or involve SRM (see section 3).  
      - Decide whether a corrected invoice/PO can be obtained or if invoice should be rejected.

31. **[Exclusive Gateway G7] Supervisor outcome?** – L4  
    - G7 = PROCEED (terms clarified / PO in place)  
    - G7 = REJECT

   - **G7 = PROCEED:**  
     32. **[Task T22] Communicate resolution and updated data to AP** – L4  
         - Input: Clarified terms, new or updated PO, confirmed quantities/prices.  
     33. **[Task T23] AP updates record and resumes standard flow** – L2  
         - Depending on what changed, resume at:  
           - **T5/T7/T8** (if PO / receipt need reconfirmation), or  
           - **T8** directly (if only financial terms changed but receipt already confirmed).

---

#### 2.2.4 Discrepancy Detected Early by Purchasing (G2 = YES)

This pathway overlaps with 2.2.3 but starts earlier.

36. **[Task T25] Contact Supplier or instruct AP to hold invoice** – L3 (PO)  
    - Options:  
      - PO directly engages Supplier to resolve discrepancy.  
      - Or PO tells AP to hold the invoice until a corrected invoice is received.

37. **[Exclusive Gateway G8] Supplier provides correction/clarification?** – L1/L3/L2  
    - Trigger: Supplier sends corrected invoice or clarifies terms.  

   - **G8 = YES:**  
     - Corrected invoice received (reuse **E4**).  
     - AP updates invoice (reuse **T19**).  
     - Return to **T8** (re-match) and then onward as per normal flow.  

   - **G8 = NO / unresolved:**  
     - Go to **T20** (escalate to AP Supervisor), then follow 2.2.3.2.

---

### 2.3 Missing-PO Path (G1 = NO)

40. **[Exclusive Gateway G9] Supplier provides valid PO?** – L2  
    - G9 = YES: Supplier sends/informs a valid PO reference.  
    - G9 = NO: Supplier cannot provide a PO; invoice may relate to an informal/retrospective service.

#### 2.3.1 PO Provided (G9 = YES)

41. **[Task T27] Update invoice with PO and validate PO** – L2  
    - Action: Ensure PO number corresponds to an existing PO in system.  

42. **[Exclusive Gateway G10] PO valid in system?** – L2  
    - G10 = YES: proceed to standard PO-based process.  
    - G10 = NO: treat as unresolved PO issue.

   - **G10 = YES:**  
     - Flow: Go to **T3** (Log invoice in accounting system) and proceed via the standard PO path.

   - **G10 = NO:**  
     - Flow: Escalate as problematic invoice: go to **T20** (AP Supervisor escalation).

#### 2.3.2 No PO / Informal Service Invoice (G9 = NO)

43. **[Task T28] Escalate non-PO invoice to AP Supervisor** – L2 (APC)

    - Actions:  
      - Confirm that services/goods were indeed ordered/received informally.  
      - Decide whether to create a retrospective PO or reject the invoice.

45. **[Exclusive Gateway G11] Create retrospective PO or reject?** – L4  
    - G11 = CREATE RETROSPECTIVE PO  
    - G11 = REJECT

49. **[Task T33] Notify Supplier of rejection (no valid PO)** – L4 or L2  
    - Output: Rejection notice referencing missing/unacceptable PO / informal arrangements.  

50. **[End Event E5] Invoice rejected (no PO scenario)** – L4/L2

---

## 3. Cross-cutting Role: Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)

Karen’s involvement is supportive and invoked as needed in discrepancy or PO issues.

51. **[Intermediate Task T34] Involve Supplier Relationship Manager (as needed)** – L2/L3/L4  L5  
    - Typical triggers:  
      - Missing or unclear PO (around **T26–T31**).  
      - Pricing or term discrepancies (around **T17–T21**).  
    - SRM actions:  
      - Contact Supplier to request missing PO or revised invoice.  
      - Check contract(s) with Supplier for agreed pricing, terms, and conditions.  
      - Communicate the correct terms back to AP or Purchasing.

52. **[Task T35] Communicate SRM findings** – L5  L2 or L3 or L4  
    - Output: Clarified pricing, PO reference, or terms.  
    - Flow: Return to the appropriate correction/matching step, usually **T19** (AP update and re-match) or **T23** (AP resume standard flow).

## 4. Key Data Objects / Artifacts

- **D1 – Invoice** (original and corrected versions)  
  - Origin: Supplier (L1).  
  - Used by: AP (L2), Purchasing (L3), DM (L6), APS (L4).

- **D2 – Purchase Order (PO)**  
  - Pre-existing; referenced throughout.  
  - Used by: AP (L2), Purchasing (L3), APS (L4), DM (L6).

- **D3 – Receipt/Delivery Confirmation**  
  - Implicit/explicit record of goods/services receipt; primarily checked by Purchasing (T5).  

- **D4 – Exception / Escalation Record**  
  - Created when escalated to APS (T20, T28).  

- **D5 – Manager Approval Record**  
  - Created in system after DM approval (T11).  

- **D6 – Payment Schedule Entry / Payment Batch**  
  - Created when AP schedules the invoice for payment (T12).

- **D7 – Supplier Contract / Agreement**  
  - Consulted by SRM to resolve pricing/terms discrepancies.

---

## 5. Noted Ambiguities / Modeling Assumptions

- **Who performs the “main” matching?**  
  Both AP and Purchasing check invoice vs PO. The model includes:  
  - Purchasing: receipt + high-level PO match (T5).  
  - AP: detailed line-item matching (T8).  
  The exact division of responsibilities is approximated.

- **Re-checks after corrections:**  
  When a corrected invoice arrives or terms are clarified, the model loops back to AP matching (T8) and, optionally, Purchasing confirmation (T5), though interviews do not specify whether Purchasing always re-confirms.

- **Manager re-approval after changes:**  
  If manager initially rejects or holds and corrections are made, the model assumes a repeated approval cycle (T9–T11). Detail on whether manager always re-approves after any change is not given.

- **Initiator of escalation to APS:**  
  Interviews indicate both AP and Purchasing may escalate; modeled as a single step T20/T28, regardless of who triggers it.

This textual model can be translated directly into a BPMN diagram by creating a single pool with the lanes listed in section 1 and adding the nodes, gateways, and sequence flows as described.
