# Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics:

**Reconstructing Job Flows:** Process mining techniques will be employed to reconstruct the actual job flow through the shop floor by analyzing the MES event logs. We'll use sequence discovery algorithms, such as Inductive Mining (IM) or Data-Aware Process Discovery, to identify the most frequent task sequences and job flows. This will help us understand typical routing patterns and uncover any deviations from optimal routes due to disruptions or specific scheduling rules. By visualizing these flows, we can identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the current process.

**Quantifying Key Metrics:**
- **Job Flow Times:** Measure the time taken for a job to complete each task from start to finish, including setup, processing, and breakdown periods. This can be calculated as the difference between 'Task Start' and 'Task End' timestamps for each specific activity/task in the log.
- **Lead Times:** Calculate lead times by subtracting the 'Job Released' timestamp from the earliest 'Task Start' timestamp of that job across all its activities.
- **Makespan Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of makespans (total time taken to complete a job) to identify jobs consistently taking longer than expected and potential bottlenecks in specific tasks or machines.
- **Task Waiting Times:** Track the duration a task waits at a work center before it is processed, which can be calculated as the difference between the 'Queue Entry' timestamp of a task and its actual 'Setup Start' or 'Processing Start' time.
- **Resource Utilization:** Measure machine and operator utilization by tracking total processing, setup, breakdown, and idle times for each resource. This includes calculating productive time (time spent processing tasks) as a percentage of overall availability.
- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** Utilize sequence mining techniques to analyze the relationship between previous jobs processed on the same machine and current setup duration. By comparing setups after similar previous jobs, we can establish patterns and quantify the impact of job sequences on setup times.
- **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:** Measure the deviation from order due dates by tracking the difference between actual completion time and promised delivery date for each job, and calculate tardiness rates accordingly.
- **Disruption Impact:** Identify disruptions (breakdowns, urgent jobs) and their impact on schedules using event logging. This can be done by analyzing the timing of disruptions relative to job progress and their effects on subsequent task execution and overall schedule adherence.

## Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies:

**Bottleneck Identification:** Process mining can reveal bottlenecks by identifying resources consistently operating at high utilization (close to 100%) while having a low throughput rate. This indicates potential issues with resource management or process efficiency. For example, if a specific machine is always occupied and rarely completes tasks on time, it may be a bottleneck.

**Task Prioritization Analysis:** By comparing the execution time of jobs with different priorities (low, medium, high), we can assess if current prioritization rules are effective. If high-priority or urgent jobs consistently experience delays, it suggests poor task prioritization. This analysis can also highlight potential bottlenecks in handling urgent orders.

**Suboptimal Sequencing:** Process mining algorithms can uncover sequences with significantly increased setup times by comparing tasks that immediately follow similar previous jobs and identifying patterns in frequent suboptimal setups. For instance, if certain machines are consistently busy setting up after processing the same type of job, this could be an issue.

**Resource Contention:** Analyzing resource contention involves identifying periods where multiple critical resources become available at around the same time, leading to potential bottlenecks. This can help determine if upstream scheduling decisions or machine availability issues cause starvation downstream.

**Bullwhip Effect:** Process mining can track changes in WIP levels over time and correlate them with variations in scheduling patterns. If WIP fluctuations are not in line with production output, it may indicate a bullwhip effect caused by unpredictable lead times or poor scheduling control.

# Root Cause Analysis:

Process mining helps differentiate between scheduling logic issues and resource capacity limitations/ inherent process variability:
- **Static Dispatching Rules:** Review the current dispatching rules to identify limitations in handling dynamic shop floor conditions, such as varying job priorities, resource availability, and sequence dependencies. Process mining can help uncover where these rules are not effective and need refinement or replacement with more sophisticated logic.
- **Real-time Visibility Gaps:** Analyze MES logs for instances where real-time visibility of the shop floor is lacking. This could be due to inaccurate reporting or communication issues between systems. Process mining can highlight data gaps affecting scheduling accuracy.
- **Setup Time Estimation:** Examine if setup time estimations are accurate and consistent with actual historical data. Inaccurate predictions may result in inadequate planning, leading to delays. Process mining can provide insights into where and why these estimations fall short.
- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Issues:** Process mining analysis of sequence-dependent setup times can identify specific job sequences causing prolonged setup durations. This information is crucial for optimizing routing or machine utilization strategies.
- **Work Center Coordination:** Investigate if there are coordination issues between work centers, leading to resource contention or inadequate workload distribution. Process mining can highlight variations in task execution patterns across different stations.
- **Disruption Response Strategies:** Review how the system handles disruptions (breakdowns, urgent jobs). If response mechanisms are ineffective, process mining can illustrate the impact of these events on overall scheduling performance and identify areas for improvement.

# Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies:

## Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules:
- **Logic:** Develop dynamic dispatching rules that consider multiple factors such as remaining processing time, job priority, due date, downstream machine load, and estimated sequence-dependent setup times based on historical data mining. Weights assigned to these factors will be determined through process mining insights, balancing throughput, tardiness reduction, and resource utilization goals.
- **Process Mining Application:** Use process discovery techniques to analyze typical task execution patterns and uncover optimal dispatching logic. Then, employ pattern mining to identify sequences of tasks that consistently lead to efficient scheduling outcomes. These insights inform the design of improved dispatching rules.
- **Impact on KPIs:** Enhanced rules should reduce tardiness by prioritizing high-value jobs and improving machine utilization through more effective workload distribution while considering setup times and downstream resource availability.

## Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling:
- **Logic:** Utilize historical task duration distributions (mined from logs) and predictive maintenance data to forecast potential bottlenecks or delays proactively. This involves modeling task times based on factors like operator experience, job complexity, and equipment reliability.
- **Process Mining Input:** Analyze past task execution patterns to identify trends in task durations under different conditions. By comparing similar jobs, we can establish duration correlations with relevant factors and build predictive models. Integrate maintenance data for more accurate predictions of machine availability during specific tasks.
- **Addressing Pathologies:** This strategy should provide early warnings about potential delays due to bottlenecks or disruptions by using real-time shop floor data (if available). It improves schedule adherence through proactive adjustments.
- **KPI Impact:** Reduced lead times and improved tardiness rates, increased throughput due to better resource allocation and reduced disruption impact.

## Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization:
- **Logic:** Focus on minimizing sequence-dependent setup times by optimizing job sequencing at bottleneck machines or employing intelligent batching of similar jobs to spread out setup durations. Analyze historical setup patterns to identify optimal batch sizes and sequences, especially for tasks with varying complexity and resource requirements.
- **Process Mining Contribution:** Discover patterns in setup time variations caused by specific previous jobs on the same machine. Utilize these insights to design strategies that group similar jobs together or rearrange routing to minimize frequent setups after particular job types.
- **Impact on KPIs:** Reduced makespan for all jobs, improved resource utilization by minimizing idle times due to setup operations, and reduced impact of sequence-dependent delays.

# Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement:

**Discrete Event Simulation (DES):** DES models can be built using process mining data/insights to simulate various scheduling scenarios before deployment. By parameterizing the simulation with task time distributions, breakdown frequencies, setup time models, and routing probabilities, we can test different strategies against each other and against a baseline under controlled conditions. High-load scenarios, frequent disruptions, and priority changes can be simulated to evaluate strategy effectiveness and robustness.

**Continuous Monitoring:** Implement automated process mining solutions for ongoing schedule performance tracking post-deployment. Real-time data from MES logs can be fed into these systems, allowing for instant updates on job flow times, resource utilization, and tardiness rates. Machine learning algorithms can be employed to detect patterns indicative of new inefficiencies or scheduling drift, triggering adjustments to the chosen strategy. Regularly scheduled process mining exercises will help identify areas needing optimization over time.

**Adaptation and Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop where continuous monitoring data informs adjustments to scheduling logic. If KPIs deviate from expected outcomes post-implementation, process mining insights can guide corrective actions by analyzing root causes. This iterative approach ensures the chosen strategy remains effective and adaptable as shop floor dynamics evolve.
