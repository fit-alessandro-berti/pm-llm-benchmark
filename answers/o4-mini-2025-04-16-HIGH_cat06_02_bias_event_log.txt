Bias creeps in at exactly one point in this pipeline—the “Community” bonus—and it tips the balance for borderline applicants:

1. The “+10 (Community)” adjustment  
   • Only applicants who both live locally AND belong to a named community group (here Highland Civic Darts Club) get +10 to their score.  
   • No other group, and no one outside that club, ever sees that bump—even if their raw creditworthiness is identical or better.

2. How that skews the outcomes  
   • Case C001 starts at 710, gets +10 for club membership, ends up at 720  approved  
   • Case C003 starts at 715, gets no adjustment  remains 715  rejected  
   Despite C003’s higher raw score, the club member leaps ahead.  
   Likewise, C004 (690  700) squeaks over the implicit 700point approval threshold only because of the +10 community bonus.

3. Who loses out?  
   – Nonmembers (no matter how good their credit profile) cannot make up the same ground.  
   – Applicants outside that particular geographic/social circle are defacto penalized.  
   – If club membership correlates with income, race or other protected traits, this becomes a proxy for unfair discrimination.

4. Broader fairness implications  
   – Credit risk decisions should rest on financial behavior, not on who you know or where you play darts.  
   – By baking in a communityaffiliation bonus, you systematically favor a narrow slice of the population.  
   – Even the manual underwriters simply carry forward that adjustment, so it isn’t being rechecked or justified on risk grounds.

If two applicants are nearly identical in creditworthiness, the one without the “right” club tie is penalized—eroding both the equity and defensibility of the approval process.
