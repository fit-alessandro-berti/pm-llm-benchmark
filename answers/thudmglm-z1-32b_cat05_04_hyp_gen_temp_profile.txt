### Anomalies Identified:
1. **R  P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - **Suspiciously Low STDEV (1 hour):** The rigid 1-hour standard deviation suggests automated scheduling, bypassing evaluation steps.  
   - **Hypothesis:** Automated approvals triggered by time-based rules (e.g., claims under $X auto-approved after 24 hours).  

2. **P  N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - **Long Delay (7 days) with High STDEV (2 days):** Notifications are inconsistently delayed, possibly due to manual backlogs.  
   - **Hypothesis:** Notifications batched weekly or stuck in a review queue for high-risk claims.  

3. **A  C (Assign to Close):**  
   - **Abnormally Short Time (2 hours):** Claims closed without evaluation/approval steps.  
   - **Hypothesis:** Duplicate claims or system errors where claims are auto-closed.  

4. **E  N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - **Vanishingly Short Gap (5 minutes):** Suggests notifications fire immediately post-evaluation, bypassing approvals.  
   - **Hypothesis:** Evaluate  Notify shortcut for low-severity claims, or missing log entries for approvals.

### Verification SQL Queries  

#### 1. **Automated RP Approvals Without Evaluation**  
```sql
-- Find claims approved <25 hours after submission but WITH evaluation skipped
SELECT c.claim_id, 
       (ce_p.timestamp - ce_r.timestamp) AS approval_duration
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_r ON c.claim_id = ce_r.claim_id AND ce_r.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events ce_p ON c.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_p.timestamp - ce_r.timestamp)) <= 90000  -- <~25 hours
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM claim_events ce_e 
    WHERE ce_e.claim_id = c.claim_id 
      AND ce_e.activity = 'E' 
      AND ce_e.timestamp BETWEEN ce_r.timestamp AND ce_p.timestamp
  );
```

#### 2. **PN Backlog Correlated with Adjusters/Regions**  
```sql
-- Claims delayed >2 days after approval, grouped by adjuster/region
SELECT CE_p.adjuster, 
       c.region, 
       COUNT(*) AS delayed_notifications,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_n.timestamp - ce_p.timestamp))) AS avg_delay_seconds
FROM claim_events ce_p
JOIN claims c ON ce_p.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce_n ON c.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
WHERE ce_n.timestamp > ce_p.timestamp + INTERVAL '2 days'
  AND ce_n.event_id > ce_p.event_id
GROUP BY ce_p.adjuster, c.region
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;  -- Focus on adjusters/regions with 5 cases
```

#### 3. **AC Shortcuts for High-Value Claims**  
```sql
-- Claims closed <1 hour post-assignment, filtering by high claim amounts
SELECT c.claim_id, 
       c.claim_amount, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_c.timestamp - ce_a.timestamp)) AS assign_to_close_seconds
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_a ON c.claim_id = ce_a.claim_id AND ce_a.activity = 'A'
JOIN claim_events ce_c ON c.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id AND ce_c.activity = 'C'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_c.timestamp - ce_a.timestamp)) < 3600  -- <1 hour
  AND c.claim_amount > 50000;  -- Investigate expensive claims first
```

#### 4. **EN Shortcuts by Claim Type/Adjuster**  
```sql
-- EvaluateNotify in <10 minutes, segmenting by claim type and adjuster
SELECT c.claim_type, 
       ae.adjuster, 
       COUNT(*) AS fast_notifies
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_e ON c.claim_id = ce_e.claim_id AND ce_e.activity = 'E'
JOIN claim_events ce_n ON c.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
JOIN adjusters ae ON ce_e.resource = ae.adjuster_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_n.timestamp - ce_e.timestamp)) < 600  -- <10 minutes
  AND ce_n.event_id > ce_e.event_id
GROUP BY c.claim_type, ae.adjuster
HAVING COUNT(*) > 20;  -- Target frequent offenders
```

### Root Cause Hypothesis Matrix  
| Anomaly | Hypothesis | Query  |  
|---------|------------|--------------|  
| RP     | Auto-approve small claims after 24h | [Query 1](#1) |  
| PN     | Regional teams ignore notifications until backlog cleared | [Query 2](#2) |  
| AC     | Duplicate cases auto-closed by rule engine | [Query 3](#3) |  
| EN     | "Quick resolution" policy for commercial insurance claims | [Query 4](#4) |  

These queries isolate problematic workflows, enabling targeted process audits (e.g., reviewing Query 1 results for compliance violations in systemic auto-approvals).
