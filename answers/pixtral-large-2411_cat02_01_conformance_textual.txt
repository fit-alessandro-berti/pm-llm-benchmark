Let's analyze each case in the event log against the normative process description to identify any deviations.

### Case 1
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1       | 2023-10-05 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 11:00    | Authorize payment  |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 12:00    | Package items      |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 13:00    | Ship order         |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 14:00    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- This case follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order.
- This sequence aligns perfectly with the normative process for sufficient inventory.

**Conclusion:** No deviations.

### Case 2
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2       | 2023-10-06 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 09:30    | Check inventory    |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 10:00    | Package items      |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 11:30    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- This case follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order.
- The normative process requires "Authorize payment" to occur before "Package items".

**Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".

### Case 3
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 3       | 2023-10-07 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 09:20    | Check inventory    |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 09:40    | Authorize payment  |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 10:00    | Cancel order       |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 10:30    | Ship order         |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 11:00    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- This case follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order.
- The normative process specifies that "Ship order" should not occur after "Cancel order".

**Violation:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".

### Case 4
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:10    | Check inventory    |
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:20    | Cancel order       |
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:50    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- This case follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order.
- This sequence aligns perfectly with the normative process for insufficient inventory.

**Conclusion:** No deviations.

### Case 5
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 5       | 2023-10-09 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 11:30    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- This case follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order.
- The normative process requires "Package items" to occur before "Ship order".

**Violation:** "Package items" is missing before "Ship order".

### Summary of Violations:
- **Case 2:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".
- **Case 3:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".
- **Case 5:** "Package items" is missing before "Ship order".

These cases deviate from the intended process flow as described in the normative process.
