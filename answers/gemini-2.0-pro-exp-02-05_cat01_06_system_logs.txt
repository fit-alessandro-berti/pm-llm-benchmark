**Explanation of Logic:**

1.  **Case Identification (Case ID):**
    *   The core logic for defining a "case" is based on the **`Window` attribute** from the system log, which typically represents the specific document, email context, or file the user is interacting with.
    *   Each unique `Window` title (e.g., "Quarterly_Report.docx", "Document1.docx", "Email - Inbox", "Report_Draft.pdf", "Budget_2024.xlsx") is treated as a distinct Case ID.
    *   This approach assumes that user work is primarily oriented around these specific objects. When the user switches between windows (documents/applications), they are effectively switching between different cases or tasks. Events occurring while a specific window has focus (or is the target of an action like `CLICK`, `TYPING`, `SAVE`) are assigned to the corresponding case.
    *   Events like `SWITCH` are transitional and don't belong exclusively to one case object. They are implicitly handled by assigning subsequent actions (like `FOCUS` or direct interactions like `CLICK`/`SCROLL` in the new window) to the *target* window's case.

2.  **Activity Naming (Activity Name):**
    *   The goal was to translate low-level system actions into more meaningful, standardized activities suitable for process analysis.
    *   `FOCUS`: Mapped to `Focus on Window`, indicating the start or resumption of interaction with a specific case object.
    *   `TYPING`: Generally mapped to `Edit Content`. For the email context (`App=Google Chrome`, `Window=Email - Inbox`), it was specifically mapped to `Compose Email` for better context.
    *   `SAVE`: Mapped directly to `Save`.
    *   `CLICK`: Mapped based on the specific `Action` attribute provided in the log (e.g., `Open Email`, `Start Reply`, `Send Email`). If no specific action was provided, a generic `Interact` or `Click Element` might be used, but here the context allowed for more specific names.
    *   `SCROLL`: Mapped to `Review Content`, representing navigation or reading within the object.
    *   `HIGHLIGHT`: Mapped directly to `Highlight Text`.
    *   `CLOSE`: Mapped directly to `Close`, signifying the end of interaction with the object in that session segment.
    *   `SWITCH`: These events were deliberately *omitted* from the final log as distinct activities. They represent the *transition between* cases rather than an activity *within* a case. The change in focus and subsequent activities in the new window capture the context switch implicitly.

3.  **Event Attributes:**
    *   **Case ID:** As described above (derived from `Window`).
    *   **Activity Name:** As described above (derived and standardized from `Action` and context).
    *   **Timestamp:** The original timestamp from the system log.
    *   **Application:** Added as an extra attribute for context, taken directly from the `App` field.
    *   **Original Action:** Included for traceability back to the source log data.

This transformation provides a structured event log where each row represents a meaningful step within a defined task (case), making it ready for analysis using process mining tools to discover workflows, bottlenecks, and variations in how users interact with different documents and applications.
