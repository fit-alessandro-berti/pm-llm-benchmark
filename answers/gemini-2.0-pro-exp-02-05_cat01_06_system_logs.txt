**Explanation:**

The event log is structured to reflect distinct work sessions related to individual documents, emails, or spreadsheets.  Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1.  **Case Identification:** Cases are primarily defined by the combination of the application and the "Window" title (which typically represents a specific file or email thread).  This assumes that actions within the same window context relate to the same task.  For example, all actions involving "Document1.docx" are grouped under "Case_Document1," actions within "Email - Inbox" are part of "Case_Email", actions involving "Report_Draft.pdf" belong to "Case_Report_Draft," and those with "Budget_2024.xlsx" are grouped as "Case_Budget_2024." The first appearance of Quarterly Report is before Document1.docx. The focus events show this so those are put into separate cases.

2.  **Activity Naming:**
    *   **FOCUS:** Changed to "Edit Document" when the user switches focus to a new document. Represents the initiation or resumption of work on a document.
    *   **TYPING:**  Transformed into more descriptive activities based on the content in the `Keys` field.  For example, "TYPING,Keys=Draft intro paragraph" becomes "Draft Intro."  "TYPING,Keys=Additional details here" becomes a general "Add Details".
    *   **SAVE:**  "Save Document" or "Save Budget", consistently indicating the saving action.
    *   **SWITCH:** This is a critical activity indicating context switching between different applications. It's retained and includes "FromApp" and "FromWindow" in the additional information to show the origin of the switch.
    *   **CLICK (in Email context):**  Distinguished between opening, replying, and sending emails ("Open Email," "Reply to Email," "Send Email").
    *   **SCROLL (in Email):** Interpreted as "Read Email".
    *    **SCROLL (in PDF):** Interpreted as "Review PDF".
    *    **HIGHLIGHT (in PDF):** Interpreted as "Highlight PDF".
    *   **CLOSE:** "Close Document" to signify the end of a specific document editing session.
3. **Event Attributes**:

    -   **Case ID**:  `Case_` prefixed to the document/email/spreadsheet identifier (e.g., `Case_Document1`).
    -   **Activity Name**: As described above, these are standardized and descriptive.
    -   **Timestamp**:  The original timestamp from the log.
    -   **Application**: The application associated with the event.
    -    **Window**:  The window title, representing the document/email/spreadsheet.
    -    **Additional Info**: This is a flexible column to include extra data that might be helpful for analysis, such as the `Keys` from typing events, the `Action` from click events, or `FromApp` and `FromWindow` in switch events, `Text` in highlight events, or `Direction` for scroll events.

4. **Narrative**:
    - The event log creates a chronological view. The order of events shows a flow starting with focusing on a quarterly report, then editing a document, handling emails, reviewing a PDF, updating a budget, going back to the document to referencing the budget, and finish with further work on the quarterly report. Each Case represents a piece of work.

This approach groups events into meaningful cases, provides descriptive activity names, and retains important attributes for analysis, making it suitable for input into process mining tools. The resulting event log tells a clear story of the user's work session.
