### **Explanation:**
- **Existence Constraints**: Ensures that Idea Generation (`IG`) and Final Launch (`FL`) must occur at least once.
- **Init Constraint**: The process must begin with `IG`.
- **Responded Existence**: If `AG` (Approval Gate) occurs, it is guaranteed that prior necessary steps happened.
- **Coexistence**: Ensures dependencies between Technical Feasibility Check (`TFC`) and Design Draft (`DD`), and Marketing Plan (`MP`) with Approval Gate (`AG`).
- **Response Constraints**: Enforces that each activity is followed by the next step in the process.
- **Precedence Constraints**: Ensures that each step only occurs if the necessary prior step was completed.
- **Succession Constraints**: Enforces that each activity is both preceded and followed by its respective next or previous step.
