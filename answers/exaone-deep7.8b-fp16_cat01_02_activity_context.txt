<thought>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the event log provided. Each case (C001, C002, C003) has a series of activities with timestamps and contexts. The key point is that the same activity names can have different meanings within the same case depending on their timing and context. My job is to rename those recurring activities to better reflect their unique contexts.

Starting with the first case, C001. Let's look at the activities here:

1. Initiate Request
2. Verify Documents (twice)
3. Call Customer (twice)
4. Submit Additional
5. Approve Request

Looking at the "Verify Documents" activities: the first one at 09:20 is when the back office agent checks identity documents. The second one at 10:30 happens after the customer uploads an ID scan, so the agent re-checks now that they have the document. So the context here is different: first it's checking physical documents, then after digital info is provided, it's verifying again. So maybe "Verify Initial Documents" and "Verify Digital Submission"?

Wait, but maybe more precise. The first Verify Documents is before the ID scan is submitted. The second is after. So the first is verifying existing documents, the second is confirming the new document is correct. Alternatively, maybe "Verify Identity Documents" vs "Confirm Document Submission".

Alternatively, perhaps "Verify Documents (Original)" vs "Verify Documents (Updated)"? Hmm. Maybe "Verify Initial Documentation" and "Verify Revised Documentation"?

Alternatively, the first is checking the original documents, the second is checking after the customer provided an ID scan. Wait, in the first case, the customer submits an ID scan in "Submit Additional" at 10:10. Then at 10:30, they verify again. So maybe the first Verify is for the original documents, and the second is to confirm the ID scan is valid. So perhaps "Verify Original Documents" and "Verify ID Scan"?

Alternatively, maybe "Verify Documents (Pre-Submission)" and "Verify Documents (Post-Submission)". That could work. But maybe "Verify Physical Documents" and "Verify Digital Submission"?

Alternatively, perhaps "Verify Identity Documents" (the first one) and "Confirm ID Scan" (the second). But the second activity's description says "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided." So maybe the agent is verifying that the ID scan is correct. So maybe "Verify ID Scan" would be better for the second one.

Similarly, the "Call Customer" occurs twice in C001. The first call is because verification was incomplete, so the agent calls to request missing docs. The second call isn't present here, but in another case? Wait, in C001, the second call isn't there. Wait, in C001, there are two calls? Let me check again.

Looking at C001's calls: first at 09:45, then no others. Wait, the second call in C001 isn't there. Wait, in the first case, the calls are:

First call: "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs."

Then no other calls in C001. The second call is in C002. Wait, in C002, there are two calls: at 09:00 and 09:50. The first is to clarify account discrepancy, the second is a follow-up. So for C001's "Call Customer", it's only once. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the event log for C001:

The activities are:

Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer (once), Submit Additional, Verify Documents again, then Approve.

Ah, so in C001, "Call Customer" occurs only once. Wait, the user's log shows for C001, the third event is "Call Customer" at 09:45, and then the fifth event is another "Verify Documents". So "Call Customer" only once in C001. The second occurrence of "Call Customer" is in C002 and C003. Wait, in C002, there are two "Call Customer" events. So perhaps the first case doesn't have a duplicate. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Looking at the log:

For C001:

The activities are:

1. Initiate Request

2. Verify Documents (09:20)

3. Call Customer (09:45)

4. Submit Additional (10:10)

5. Verify Documents (10:30)

6. Approve Request

So "Verify Documents" occurs twice here, but "Call Customer" only once. So the duplicates are in "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer" in other cases. Wait, in C002, "Call Customer" occurs twice. Let me check:

C002 has:

Call Customer at 09:00 and 09:50. So two instances here. So "Call Customer" appears twice in C002. Similarly, in C003, "Call Customer" occurs once (at 11:50). So the duplicates are "Verify Documents" (appearing twice in C001, C002, C003) and "Call Customer" (twice in C002). So the main recurring activities across cases are "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer".

Wait, let's check all cases for duplicates:

Looking for activities that repeat in the same case:

C001: Verify Documents twice.

C002: Call Customer twice, Verify Documents once (no, in C002, Verify Documents is once, but "Call Customer" twice).

Wait, C002's activities:

Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer (twice), Adjust Account, Call Customer again, then Approve. So "Call Customer" is twice here. "Verify Documents" once. So "Call Customer" is duplicated here.

C003 has "Verify Documents" twice (at 11:25 and 12:20), "Call Customer" once, and "Adjust Account" once. So "Verify Documents" duplicated here as well.

So the activities that appear multiple times within the same case are:

- Verify Documents (in C001, C003)

- Call Customer (in C002)

So these are the activities that need to be renamed to reflect their different contexts within the same case.

Now, for each of these activities, I need to analyze their different contexts in the same case and come up with new names.

Starting with "Verify Documents" in C001:

First occurrence (09:20): Agent checks identity documents. The context is that the customer submitted a request via the portal, and the agent checks their identity documents (like ID proof).

Second occurrence (10:30): After the customer submits an ID scan (in "Submit Additional" at 10:10), the agent re-checks the documents now that the ID scan is provided. Wait, actually, the "Submit Additional" is the customer uploading the ID scan. So after that, the agent checks again. So perhaps the first Verify Documents is checking the original documents, and the second is checking the new ID scan? Or maybe the first is verifying the physical documents, and the second is confirming the digital submission?

Alternatively, maybe the first is verifying the customer's original documents (like their ID), and the second is verifying the newly submitted ID scan. So the first is the initial verification, the second is a subsequent check after receiving the new document. So maybe "Verify Original Documents" and "Verify Submitted Documents"?

Alternatively, "Verify Identity Documents" (first) and "Confirm ID Scan" (second). That might be better. Because the first is checking the original documents, the second is confirming the ID scan they just uploaded.

In C003, "Verify Documents" occurs twice. Let's look at those:

First Verify Documents (11:25): BranchOfficer checks physical verification of ID. The customer walked in, so the officer checks their ID physically.

Second Verify Documents (12:20): After an "Adjust Account" (at 12:05), the officer re-verifies the docs. So this is a post-adjustment check. So the first is initial physical check, the second is re-checking after an account change. So maybe "Verify Initial ID" and "Verify Post-Adjustment ID".

Alternatively, "Verify Physical ID" and "Verify Adjusted Account Documents".

Hmm. The context here is that after the account was adjusted (due to missing info), they re-verify the documents. So the second Verify is to ensure that after the adjustment, the documents are still valid.

So for C003's Verify Documents, the two instances are:

1. Initial physical check (when customer walked in)

2. After account adjustment, re-checking documents.

So "Verify Physical ID" and "Verify Adjusted Account Documents".

Now for "Call Customer" in C002:

First call at 08:15: "Agent checks identity documents" no, wait, the first call in C002 is at 08:05 Initiate Request, then Verify Documents at 08:15. The first call is at 09:00: "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy." The second call at 09:50 is a follow-up to confirm adjustments made.

So the first call is to clarify the account discrepancy (maybe the customer's account has an issue that wasn't resolved by the initial verification?), and the second is a follow-up after an adjustment was made. So the context of the call changes from clarifying an issue to confirming the adjustment was done.

So the first call is "Clarify Account Discrepancy" and the second is "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up".

Alternatively, maybe "Clarify Issue" and "Confirm Change".

Alternatively, the first call is to get more info to resolve the discrepancy, the second is to confirm that the adjustment was done as per the call.

So for the "Call Customer" activities in C002, they should be renamed to reflect their purpose.

Now, proceeding to the other cases where "Verify Documents" occurs again. Let's check C003 again.

Now, the plan is to rename each occurrence of the duplicated activities to a more context-specific name.

Let me list all the duplicated activities across cases:

1. "Verify Documents" appears in:

- C001 (twice)

- C002 (once, but not duplicated here)

Wait, in C002, "Verify Documents" occurs once. So the main duplicates are in C001 and C003 for "Verify Documents".

Wait, in C003, "Verify Documents" occurs twice. So for each case where the activity is duplicated, we need to rename each occurrence.

Similarly, "Call Customer" is duplicated in C002 (twice).

Other activities like "Submit Additional" only occur once per case. "Adjust Account" occurs once in C002 and C003, but not duplicated in the same case. "Approve Request" is once per case.

So the activities to rename are:

In C001: "Verify Documents" (twice)

In C003: "Verify Documents" (twice)

In C002: "Call Customer" (twice)

Now, let's tackle each one.

Starting with C001's "Verify Documents":

First occurrence (09:20): Agent checks identity documents. The customer just submitted a request via the portal, so the agent checks their ID documents. This is the initial verification.

Second occurrence (10:30): After the customer submits an ID scan (in "Submit Additional" at 10:10), the agent re-checks. So this is verifying the new ID scan provided. So the first is verifying original documents, the second verifying the new submission.

Possible names:

First: "Verify Original Identity Documents"

Second: "Verify Submitted ID Scan"

Alternatively, "Verify Customer's Original Documents" and "Verify ID Scan Submission".

Alternatively, "Verify Initial Documentation" and "Verify Updated Documentation".

Alternatively, "Verify Identity Documents (Original)" and "Verify ID Scan (Post-Submission)".

I think the first two options are better. Let's go with "Verify Original Documents" and "Verify Submitted ID Scan".

In C003's "Verify Documents":

First at 11:25: BranchOfficer checks physical verification of ID. The customer walked in, so this is the initial check.

Second at 12:20: After adjusting the account (at 12:05), the officer re-verifies the documents. So this is a post-adjustment check to ensure the documents are valid now.

Possible names:

First: "Verify Physical ID Presentation"

Second: "Verify Adjusted Account Documents"

Alternatively, "Verify Initial Physical ID" and "Verify Post-Adjustment Documents".

The second could be "Verify Adjusted Account Documentation".

In C002's "Call Customer" activities:

First call (09:00): To clarify account discrepancy. The customer's account had an issue that wasn't resolved by the initial verification (maybe the documents were missing?), so the agent calls to get more info.

Second call (09:50): Follow-up to confirm that the adjustment made during the call was successful.

Possible names:

First: "Clarify Account Discrepancy"

Second: "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up"

Alternatively, "Clarify Issue" and "Confirm Adjustment".

Now, let's check other possible duplicates. Are there any other activities that repeat in the same case?

Looking at C003's "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer" are the only ones with duplicates in their case.

Now, proceeding to rename all instances.

Starting with C001's Verify Documents:

First occurrence (09:20): "Verify Original Documents"

Second occurrence (10:30): "Verify Submitted ID Scan"

In C003's Verify Documents:

First (11:25): "Verify Physical ID"

Second (12:20): "Verify Adjusted Account Documents"

In C002's Call Customer:

First (09:00): "Clarify Account Discrepancy"

Second (09:50): "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up"

Now, let's check other activities for possible duplicates. For example, "Approve Request" occurs once in each case, so no. "Submit Additional" once. "Adjust Account" occurs in C002 and C003 but not duplicated in the same case. So only the above activities need renaming.

Now, let's apply these changes to the event log.

Original log for C001:

| C001    | Initiate Request  | ... |
|       | Verify Documents  | ... |
|       | Call Customer     | ... |
|       | Submit Additional | ... |
|       | Verify Documents  | ... |
|       | Approve Request   | ... |

After renaming:

| C001    | Initiate Request  | ... |
|       | Verify Original Documents | ... |
|       | Call Customer     | ... |
|       | Submit Additional | ... |
|       | Verify Submitted ID Scan | ... |
|       | Approve Request   | ... |

Wait, but the second Verify Documents in C001 is now "Verify Submitted ID Scan".

For C003's Verify Documents:

First: "Verify Physical ID"

Second: "Verify Adjusted Account Documents"

C002's Calls:

First call: "Clarify Account Discrepancy"

Second call: "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up"

Now, let's check other possible activities. For example, in C002's "Adjust Account" is only once, so no duplication there. Similarly, "Submit Additional" only once.

Now, let's also check if any other activities have duplicates in other cases. For example, "Initiate Request" occurs in all three cases but only once per case, so no. "Approve Request" same.

Now, let's proceed to rewrite the event log with the renamed activities.

Starting with C001:

Original lines for Verify Documents:

First: Verify Documents at 09:20  "Verify Original Documents"

Second: Verify Documents at 10:30  "Verify Submitted ID Scan"

C001's Call Customer is only once, so no change there.

C002's two Call Customer events become "Clarify Account Discrepancy" and "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up".

C003's Verify Documents become "Verify Physical ID" and "Verify Adjusted Account Documents".

Now, let's write out the revised log with these changes.

For C001:

| Case ID | Activity                          | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |
|---------|------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| C001    | Initiate Request                  | 2024-05-01 09:15:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C001    | Verify Original Documents         | 2024-05-01 09:20:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent checks identity documents.                           |
| C001    | Call Customer                     | 2024-05-01 09:45:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs. |
| C001    | Submit Additional                | 2024-05-01 10:10:00 | CustomerSelfServe| Customer uploads the requested ID scan.                    |
| C001    | Verify Submitted ID Scan         | 2024-05-01 10:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided.    |
| C001    | Approve Request                   | 2024-05-01 10:45:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

For C002:

The two Call Customer events become:

First: "Clarify Account Discrepancy" at 09:00

Second: "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up" at 09:50.

So the lines:

Original:

| C002    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-02 09:00:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.              |
| C002    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-02 09:50:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made.                |

Become:

| C002    | Clarify Account Discrepancy | 2024-05-02 09:00:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.              |
| C002    | Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up | 2024-05-02 09:50:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made.                |

Wait, but the activity name is now "Clarify Account Discrepancy" and "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up", but the description might still be okay. Alternatively, maybe the second could be "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up" with the description adjusted, but perhaps the activity name can be more concise. Alternatively, maybe "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up" is sufficient.

For C003's Verify Documents:

First occurrence (11:25):

Original: Verify Documents  "Verify Physical ID"

Second (12:20): "Verify Adjusted Account Documents"

So the lines:

Original:

| C003    | Verify Documents  | 2024-05-03 11:25:00 | BranchOfficer    | Physical verification of ID.                               |
| C003    | Verify Documents  | 2024-05-03 12:20:00 | BranchOfficer    | Re-verify docs after account adjustment.                   |

Become:

| C003    | Verify Physical ID          | 2024-05-03 11:25:00 | BranchOfficer    | Physical verification of ID.                               |
| C003    | Verify Adjusted Account Docs | 2024-05-03 12:20:00 | BranchOfficer    | Re-verify docs after account adjustment.                   |

Wait, maybe "Verify Adjusted Account Documents" is better than "Verify Adjusted Account Docs".

Alternatively, "Verify Post-Adjustment Documents".

Hmm, perhaps "Verify Adjusted Account Documents" is clearer.

Now, let's check if there are any other activities that need renaming. For instance, in C003's "Call Customer" at 11:50:

Original activity: "Call Customer" with context "Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return."

This is only one occurrence in C003, so no duplication here. So no need to rename.

Similarly, "Adjust Account" in C003 is only once, so no duplication.

Now, let's verify that all duplicates have been addressed:

- In C001, "Verify Documents" became two different activities.

- In C002, "Call Customer" became two different activities.

- In C003, "Verify Documents" became two different activities.

Other activities that were duplicated in the same case are now renamed.

Now, the revised event log should look like this:

For C001:

| Case ID | Activity                          | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |
|---------|------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| C001    | Initiate Request                  | 2024-05-01 09:15:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C001    | Verify Original Documents         | 2024-05-01 09:20:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent checks identity documents.                           |
| C001    | Call Customer                     | 2024-05-01 09:45:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs. |
| C001    | Submit Additional                | 2024-05-01 10:10:00 | CustomerSelfServe| Customer uploads the requested ID scan.                    |
| C001    | Verify Submitted ID Scan         | 2024-05-01 10:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided.    |
| C001    | Approve Request                   | 2024-05-01 10:45:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

For C002:

| C002    | Initiate Request                  | 2024-05-02 08:05:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C002    | Verify Identity Verification       | 2024-05-02 08:15:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Identity verification.                                     |
Wait, original "Verify Documents" in C002 was only once. Wait, in the original log for C002, the second activity is "Verify Documents" at 08:15. So that's a single occurrence. So no duplication here. So the original "Verify Documents" in C002 remains as is? Wait, but in the problem statement, we only need to rename activities that appear multiple times within the same case. Since in C002, "Verify Documents" occurs once, it doesn't need to be renamed. So the original name is okay.

Wait, but in the original log for C002, the second activity is "Verify Documents" at 08:15. The description is "Identity verification." So that's a single occurrence, so no need to rename.

So the C002's activities remain as they are except for the two calls.

Continuing with C002:

| C002    | Clarify Account Discrepancy | 2024-05-02 09:00:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.              |
| C002    | Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up | 2024-05-02 09:50:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made.                |
| C002    | Adjust Account                  | 2024-05-02 09:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Adjust account details internally after call.              |

Wait, the "Adjust Account" is still as is because it's only once.

For C003:

| C003    | Initiate Request                  | 2024-05-03 11:20:00 | BranchReception  | Walk-in customer at branch.                                |
| C003    | Verify Physical ID               | 2024-05-03 11:25:00 | BranchOfficer    | Physical verification of ID.                               |
| C003    | Call Customer                     | 2024-05-03 11:50:00 | BranchOfficer    | Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return.   |
| C003    | Verify Adjusted Account Documents | 2024-05-03 12:20:00 | BranchOfficer    | Re-verify docs after account adjustment.                   |
| C003    | Adjust Account                  | 2024-05-03 12:05:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Internal correction due to missing info.                   |
| C003    | Approve Request                   | 2024-05-03 12:30:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

Wait, the "Adjust Account" in C003 is at 12:05, and there's another "Verify Adjusted Account Documents" at 12:20, but "Adjust Account" is only once. So no duplication there.

Now, let's check if all the renamed activities are correctly reflecting their contexts.

For C001's "Verify Original Documents" makes sense as the initial check. The second "Verify Submitted ID Scan" is after the customer uploads the scan, so that's correct.

In C002's calls: "Clarify Account Discrepancy" and "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up" capture the different purposes.

In C003's Verify Physical ID and Verify Adjusted Account Documents: the first is the initial check, the second after adjustment.

Now, the justification for the names:

- For C001's Verify Original Documents: The first verification is the agent checking the customer's original identity documents submitted with the initial request.

- Verify Submitted ID Scan: After the customer uploads an ID scan (via Submit Additional), the agent checks the submitted scan to confirm its validity.

- In C002's Clarify Account Discrepancy: The call is to address an unresolved issue (discrepancy) in the account, seeking more information.

- Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up: After the agent adjusted the account, this call confirms that the adjustment was done as discussed.

- In C003's Verify Physical ID: The officer checks the customer's physical ID presented at the branch.

- Verify Adjusted Account Documents: After adjusting the account (due to missing info), the officer re-verifies the documents to ensure they align with the new account status.

These names should now disambiguate the activities based on their context within the same case.

### Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities:

```  
| Case ID | Activity                          | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |

### **Justification for Naming Choices**  

1. **C001’s "Verify Original Documents" vs. "Verify Submitted ID Scan":**  
   - **Original Documents**: Refers to the initial check of the customer’s identity documents submitted with the request.  
   - **Submitted ID Scan**: After the customer uploads an ID scan, this activity confirms the validity of the new digital document.  

2. **C002’s "Clarify Account Discrepancy" vs. "Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up":**  
   - **Clarify Account Discrepancy**: Addresses an unresolved issue (e.g., missing documents or account errors) requiring additional information.  
   - **Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up**: Ensures the account adjustment discussed in the first call was executed correctly.  

3. **C003’s "Verify Physical ID" vs. "Verify Adjusted Account Documents":**  
   - **Verify Physical ID**: Validates the customer’s physical identity at the branch.  
   - **Verify Adjusted Account Documents**: Post-adjustment check to confirm documents align with updated account status.  

These names clarify the **contextual differences** (e.g., pre- vs. post-submission documents, initial vs. follow-up calls) and their roles in the workflow, ensuring activities are distinguishable within the same case.
