This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating an **Order Fulfillment Process** spanning four different departments within an organization.

The process is divided into four horizontal swimlanes, representing the different departments involved: **Sales**, **Production**, **Procurement**, and **Warehouse**.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the workflow:

### 1. Sales Department (Top Lane)
*   **Trigger:** The process begins with a timer event labeled **"Monday morning"**.
*   **Order & Customer Check:** The flow enters a sub-process called "Check customer's order". Inside this sub-process:
    *   The order is checked for completeness.
    *   The system checks if the customer is already in the database.
    *   **Gateway Decision:** If the customer is **not** in the database, a task is performed to "Add customer to the database". If they are, this step is skipped.
*   **Communication:** Once the order check is complete, the **"Send order details"** task is executed. This triggers two parallel message flows (dashed lines) sending information to both the **Production** and **Procurement** departments.
*   **Waiting:** The Sales process then pauses at an intermediate event to wait for a notification that the product has been sent.

### 2. Procurement Department (Third Lane)
*   **Start:** The process starts when the **"Order details arrive"** message is received from Sales.
*   **Material Acquisition:** A sub-process labeled "Material Compensation Subprocess" begins, containing the task **"Order materials"**.
*   **Quality Check:** Next is the **"Check materials"** task.
    *   **Success Path:** If materials are good, a message event sends a **"Material not faulty"** signal up to the Production department.
    *   **Failure Path:** If an error occurs (indicated by the lightning bolt symbol), the flow diverts to an **"Order cancellation"** event. This also triggers a compensation event (rewind symbol) which activates the **"Return material"** task inside the previous sub-process to handle the faulty goods.

### 3. Production Department (Second Lane)
*   **Start:** This lane is triggered when **"Order details arrive"** from Sales.
*   **Synchronization:** The flow splits into a parallel gateway:
    *   One path goes to the **"Plan production"** task.
    *   The other path waits at an intermediate message event for the **"Material not faulty"** signal from Procurement.
*   **Manufacturing:** Both the planning and the material confirmation must be complete before the process moves to the **"Manufacture product"** task.
*   **Completion:** Once manufacturing is done, a **"Product complete"** message is sent down to the Warehouse.

### 4. Warehouse Department (Bottom Lane)
*   **Start:** triggered by the **"Product complete"** message from Production.
*   **Action:** The warehouse executes the **"Send product"** task.
*   **Notification:** Upon completion, a **"Product sent"** message is sent all the way back up to the Sales department.

### 5. Sales Department (Conclusion)
*   **Resumption:** The Sales lane receives the **"Product sent"** message.
*   **Final Step:** The team performs the **"Draft invoice"** task.
*   **End:** The process concludes at the final end event (bold circle).

**Summary:**
The diagram depicts a synchronized workflow where Sales initiates the order, Procurement ensures materials are available, Production manufactures the item only after materials are verified, and the Warehouse ships the final product, notifying Sales to invoice the customer.
