This construction assumes a standard, successful execution path where every required step is performed exactly once, and the dependencies follow a logical linear flow dictated by the order fulfillment process.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # 1. Equivalence: No two distinct activities are assumed to have identical occurrence constraints.
    'equivalence': set(),

    # 2. Always Before: If Activity A occurs, Activity B must have occurred previously.
    # Example: Availability Check must always precede Reservation.
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Check Availability must precede Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reservation must precede Picking
        ('PI', 'PO'),  # Picking must precede Packing (QC sits in between, but PI must precede PO)
        ('D', 'IC'),   # Dispatch must precede Invoicing
    },

    # 3. Always After: If Activity A occurs, Activity B is executed subsequently.
    # (This is often the logical inverse of 'always_before', capturing post-requisites)
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receiving the order guarantees a subsequent Availability Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Quality Check guarantees a subsequent Packing step
    },

    # 4. Never Together: Activities cannot co-exist in the same case trace.
    # Since these are distinct sequential steps in a single order flow, they should never co-occur.
    'never_together': set(),

    # 5. Activity Occurrences: Assuming a successful execution path where every step occurs exactly once.
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {1}
    },

    # 6. Directly Follows: If Activity A occurs, Activity B shall occur immediately after.
    # This defines the primary flow of the order fulfillment process.
    'directly_follows': {
        # Initial Setup Flow
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receive Order -> Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Check Availability -> Reserve Items

        # Fulfillment Flow
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserve Items -> Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Pick Items -> Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Quality Check -> Pack Order

        # Shipping Flow
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Pack Order -> Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # Generate Shipping Label -> Dispatch

        # Financial Flow (Assuming invoice generated upon dispatch, payment recorded after)
        ('D', 'IC'),   # Dispatch -> Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')   # Invoice Customer -> Record Payment
    }
}
