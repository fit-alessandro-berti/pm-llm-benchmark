Here is one concrete example of a “legal” trace under the tree that is clearly impossible in a real Order-to-Cash process:

 1. Receive_Order  
 2. Check_Inventory  
 3. Ship_Order  
 4. Authorize_Payment  
 5. Package_Items  
 6. Close_Order  

Why this is bad from a domain point of view:

• In reality you cannot ship goods before (a) you’ve confirmed payment and (b) you’ve actually packed them.  
• The model’s PARALLEL operator on {Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order} allows all three to happen in any order, so “Ship_Order” can slip in first.  
• That underfits the business rule “Authorize  Package  Ship.”  

Because the tree never enforces the necessary sequencing among those three activities, it will happily accept “ship first, pay and pack later,” which of course would never be allowed on the shop floor or in your ERP system.
