The process begins when a customer request is received. From there, the process flows into several decision points and activities based on the request type and other conditions:

1. Start Event and Initial Task  
• The process starts when a customer request is received (“Receive Customer Request”). This task is the entry point for all incoming requests.

2. Decision Based on Request Type (XOR Gateway)  
• Immediately after the request is received, a decision point (“Check Request Type”) determines whether the request is of a standard type or a custom type. An exclusive decision (XOR) means only one branch of the process will be followed depending on the answer.

3. Handling a Standard Request  
• If the request is standard, the process follows this path:  
– Task A  Task B1 “Perform Standard Validation”: This task involves checking the standard criteria and requirements necessary to process the request.  
– Next, an AND gateway is used ("Run Parallel Checks") which implies that two parallel validation tasks must be run simultaneously.  
o Task C1 “Credit Check”: Evaluates the customer's creditworthiness.  
o Task C2 “Inventory Check”: Confirms whether the required items are in stock.  
– Once both parallel checks are complete (the join occurs), the process proceeds to Task D “Calculate Delivery Date”. This step determines when the order can be delivered based on the results of prior steps.

4. Handling a Custom Request  
• For a custom request, a different branch is followed:  
– Task B2 “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”: This involves a deeper investigation into whether the customization is practical in terms of resources, cost, or technical feasibility.  
– The process then encounters another decision point “Is Customization Feasible?” via an XOR gateway.  
o If the answer is Yes, then Task E1 “Prepare Custom Quotation” is executed to outline a custom offer.  
o If the answer is No, then Task E2 “Send Rejection Notice” occurs, and the process ends.

5. Convergence of Paths and Approval Check  
• After the completion of the tasks in either the standard or custom paths (assuming the process has not already terminated due to a rejection in the custom branch), the process reconverges into a common step: evaluating if further approval is needed.  
– A gateway “Is Approval Needed?” checks if the situation requires managerial review. This decision uses an exclusive choice (XOR), meaning only one exit is taken.

6. Approval Process  
• If approval is required:  
– Task F “Obtain Manager Approval” involves the necessary review by a manager.  
– Following that, another XOR decision “Is Approval Granted?” determines the outcome:  
o If Yes, the flow moves to Task G “Generate Final Invoice”.  
o If No, then Task H “Re-evaluate Conditions” is triggered.  
– In the event of not receiving approval, the process loops back to earlier steps. Specifically, for custom requests it goes back to Task E1 (re-preparing or adjusting the custom quotation) and for standard requests it returns to Task D (recalculating delivery dates or adjusting conditions). This looping mechanism indicates that the process allows for rework or re-assessment in order to meet internal criteria.

• If approval is not needed:  
– The process directly moves to Task G “Generate Final Invoice” without requiring the managerial step.

7. Finalization and Notification  
• After the invoice is generated (from either approval or a direct route), Task I “Send Confirmation to Customer” communicates the outcome to the customer.  
• Finally, the process concludes with the End Event.

Summary of Key Differences and Flow Controls:  
– Standard vs. Custom Paths:  
• Standard requests undergo validation and parallel operational checks (credit and inventory) before calculating a delivery date.  
• Custom requests require a feasibility analysis, and depending on feasibility, either a custom quotation is prepared or the request is rejected outright.  
– Gateways indicate decision points:  
• XOR gateways are used when only one branch of the decision is taken (for checking request type, feasibility, approval needed, and approval status).  
• The AND gateway in the standard branch ensures that both credit and inventory checks are executed simultaneously and that the flow waits until both are completed before moving forward.  
– Convergence and Loopbacks:  
• After following either path (standard or custom), tasks come together for a final confirmation step.  
• The approval step may lead to a loopback where, in case of a negative outcome, the process revisits earlier tasks (either the custom quotation or the delivery calculation) to address issues before resubmission.

Overall, the design of the process seeks to ensure that each customer request is adequately validated and processed depending on its specifics, while incorporating checks, parallel validations, managerial oversight, and opportunities for rework when necessary before final confirmation is sent to the customer.
