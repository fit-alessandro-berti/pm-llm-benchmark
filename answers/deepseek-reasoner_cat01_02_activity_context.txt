**Justification for Renaming:**

1. **`Verify Documents`  `Initial Document Verification` (C001, C002, C003)**  
   - *Clue:* The first occurrence in all cases represents the initial check of submitted documents.  
   - *Reason:* Distinguishes the starting verification step from subsequent rechecks.

2. **`Verify Documents`  `Recheck Documents After Submission` (C001)**  
   - *Clue:* Follows "Submit Additional" and mentions "ID scan is provided."  
   - *Reason:* Emphasizes the dependency on new customer input.

3. **`Verify Documents`  `Post-Adjustment Document Verification` (C003)**  
   - *Clue:* Occurs after "Adjust Account" to ensure correctness post-changes.  
   - *Reason:* Highlights the need to validate documents after internal adjustments.

4. **`Call Customer`  `Call Customer for Missing Documents` (C001)**  
   - *Clue:* Triggered by incomplete verification requiring additional documents.  
   - *Reason:* Specifies the purpose of the call (document collection).

5. **`Call Customer`  `Clarify Discrepancy Call` (C002)**  
   - *Clue:* Context mentions "account discrepancy" needing clarification.  
   - *Reason:* Focuses on resolving inconsistencies in account details.

6. **`Call Customer`  `Confirm Adjustment Call` (C002)**  
   - *Clue:* Follows "Adjust Account" to confirm changes with the customer.  
   - *Reason:* Indicates closure of the adjustment loop.

7. **`Call Customer`  `Call Customer to Return` (C003)**  
   - *Clue:* Customer "stepped out," requiring a callback to resume the process.  
   - *Reason:* Reflects the logistical context (branch walk-in interruption).

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Temporal context** (e.g., "initial," "post-adjustment") clarifies the phase of the process.  
- **Purpose-driven naming** (e.g., "clarify discrepancy") highlights the interaction’s intent.  
- **Resource/channel context** (e.g., "physical verification") distinguishes branch-specific steps.  
- This renaming ensures each activity’s role in the workflow is self-explanatory.
