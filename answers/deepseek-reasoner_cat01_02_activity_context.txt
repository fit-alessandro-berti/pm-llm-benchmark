### Justification for Renaming:

#### **1. "Verify Documents" Renaming**  
- **Initial Document Verification** (C001): First check triggered by incomplete submission.  
- **Document Re-verification with Additional Info** (C001): Post-customer action, confirming completeness.  
- **Physical Document Verification at Branch** (C003): In-person check for walk-in customers.  
- **Post-Adjustment Document Re-verification** (C003): Ensures adjustments didn’t invalidate prior verification.  

**Clues**: Timestamp order, "Additional Context" (e.g., "ID scan provided," "physical verification"), and resource roles (BranchOfficer vs. BackOfficeAgent).

---

#### **2. "Call Customer" Renaming**  
- **Request Missing Documents** (C001): Directly tied to incomplete verification.  
- **Clarify Account Discrepancy** (C002): Focused on resolving conflicting data.  
- **Confirm Adjustments** (C002): Follow-up to ensure customer awareness.  
- **Recall to Branch** (C003): Unique to in-person process interruptions.  

**Clues**: Purpose described in "Additional Context" (e.g., "request missing docs" vs. "confirm adjustments").

---

#### **3. "Initiate Request" Renaming**  
- **Via Web Portal** (C001/C002) vs. **In-Branch** (C003): Reflects channel differences (online vs. walk-in).  

**Clues**: "Resource" (WebPortal vs. BranchReception) and context descriptions.

---

#### **4. "Adjust Account" Renaming**  
- **Post-Clarification** (C002): Follows discrepancy resolution.  
- **For Missing Information** (C003): Corrects incomplete data.  

**Clues**: Trigger described in "Additional Context" (e.g., "account discrepancy" vs. "missing info").

### Key Improvements:  
- **Disambiguation**: Each activity name now reflects its unique purpose, reducing ambiguity.  
- **Process Visibility**: Names clarify whether an action is initial, corrective, or confirmatory.  
- **Channel Differentiation**: Highlights online vs. in-branch workflows.
