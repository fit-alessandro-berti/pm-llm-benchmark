### Justification for Renaming:

1. **C001: `Verify Documents`  `Initial Document Verification` and `Document Re-verification`**  
   - **First occurrence**: Initial check of identity documents.  
   - **Second occurrence**: Re-check after the customer provided missing documents.  
   - **Clues**: The additional context mentions "checks identity documents" vs. "re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided."

2. **C002: `Call Customer`  `Clarification Call (Account Discrepancy)` and `Follow-Up Call (Adjustment Confirmation)`**  
   - **First call**: Resolves an account discrepancy.  
   - **Second call**: Confirms adjustments made after the first call.  
   - **Clues**: Context highlights "clarify account discrepancy" vs. "confirm adjustments made."

3. **C003: `Verify Documents`  `In-Person Document Verification` and `Post-Adjustment Document Check`**  
   - **First occurrence**: Physical verification at a branch.  
   - **Second occurrence**: Verification after internal account adjustments.  
   - **Clues**: Context distinguishes "physical verification of ID" vs. "re-verify docs after account adjustment."

### Key Observations:
- **Non-repeating activities** (e.g., `Initiate Request`, `Adjust Account`) were not renamed because they occur only once per case.  
- **Consistency**: New names retain the original intent while adding specificity (e.g., "In-Person" for branch interactions, "Post-Adjustment" for steps after corrections).  
- **Process flow clarity**: Names now reflect dependencies (e.g., "Re-verification" implies prior steps).
