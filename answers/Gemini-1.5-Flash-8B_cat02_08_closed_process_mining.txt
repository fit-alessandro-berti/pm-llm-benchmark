Let's analyze the concepts in Process Mining and propose their opposites and broader concepts.

**Original Concepts:**

* **Automated Process Discovery:**  Discovering processes automatically from event logs.
* **Predictive Monitoring:** Using process mining to predict future process behavior.
* **Bottom-up Discovery:** Discovering process models from the "ground up," starting with event data.
* **Process Simulation:**  Testing the behavior of a process model in a simulated environment.
* **Process Efficiency:**  The degree to which a process achieves its goals using minimal resources.
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitoring process execution as it happens.


**Opposite Concepts:**

| Original Concept | Opposite Concept | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Automated Process Discovery | Manual Process Discovery |  Manually creating process models, potentially using expert knowledge and interviews instead of event logs. |
| Predictive Monitoring | Descriptive Monitoring |  Analyzing process performance only using current data; no predictive modeling is involved. Focusing on what happened, not what might happen. |
| Bottom-up Discovery | Top-down Discovery |  Starting with a predefined process model and adjusting it based on event data, rather than discovering it entirely from the event logs. |
| Process Simulation | Process Validation |  Examining the effectiveness and correctness of a process model against real-world data (often by validating simulation outputs against event logs). |
| Process Efficiency | Process Inefficiency |  A process that doesn't achieve its objectives or requires more resources than necessary.  |
| Real-time Monitoring | Batch Monitoring | Monitoring process execution in intervals, instead of in real-time; this would often involve reviewing logs after a defined time period. |



**Broader Concepts (and explanations):**

| Original Concept | Broader Concept | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Automated Process Discovery | **Process Model Inference** |  A more general term encompassing various methods for deriving process models from different sources, including event logs, business rules, textual descriptions, and more.  It includes automated discovery but also other techniques. |
| Predictive Monitoring | **Process Performance Prediction** |  The broader concept encompasses techniques beyond just predictive modeling, including descriptive analysis, prescriptive analytics, and using process data for optimization. It includes any method that aims to understand future performance, even if not exclusively reliant on predictive modeling. |
| Bottom-up Discovery | **Data-driven Process Modeling** | A wider term covering all approaches to constructing process models based on data. It includes methods for extracting process structure from logs (bottom-up), and methods that combine logs with other sources of information. |
| Process Simulation | **Process Analysis & Evaluation** |  A general category that includes simulation but also other techniques for assessing process performance, such as analytical modeling, variance analysis and even purely descriptive reporting. |
| Process Efficiency | **Process Optimization** | A more comprehensive term covering not just the efficiency aspect but also the effectiveness and overall improvement of processes.  It encompasses initiatives targeting resource reduction, cycle time optimization, defect reduction, and so on. |
| Real-time Monitoring | **Process Observability** |  A more general concept, encompassing various techniques that aim to understand the current state of the process.  It goes beyond just monitoring in the moment and includes methods for monitoring and tracking process data that enable more timely analysis and feedback. |


These broadened concepts provide a more encompassing view of the field, highlighting the interconnectedness of different process mining techniques and their implications for improving business processes.  They also move away from solely focusing on the event-log based methods to capture the diverse range of possible inputs into process modeling.
