### Analysis of the Event Log

To identify cases with significantly longer resolution times and determine potential root causes, we will:

1. **Calculate Total Resolution Time for Each Case**  
   The total resolution time is the difference between the timestamp of the "Receive Ticket" activity and the "Close Ticket" activity.

2. **Identify Cases with Longer Resolution Times**  
   Compare the resolution times across all cases to identify outliers.

3. **Analyze Patterns in Long-Resolution Cases**  
   Examine the sequence of activities, waiting times between steps, and whether escalations occurred.

4. **Propose Recommendations**  
   Based on the analysis, suggest actionable insights to address performance bottlenecks.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Resolution Time for Each Case

| Case ID | Receive Ticket       | Close Ticket         | Total Resolution Time (Hours) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00     | 2024-03-01 10:15     | 2.25                          |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05     | 2024-03-02 09:15     | 25.17                         |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10     | 2024-03-01 09:30     | 1.33                          |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20     | 2024-03-02 08:30     | 24.17                         |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25     | 2024-03-03 09:30     | 53.08                         |

### Step 2: Identify Cases with Longer Resolution Times

From the table above:
- **Case 101**: 2.25 hours (fast resolution)
- **Case 102**: 25.17 hours (longer than average)
- **Case 103**: 1.33 hours (fast resolution)
- **Case 104**: 24.17 hours (longer than average)
- **Case 105**: 53.08 hours (significantly longer)

Cases **102**, **104**, and **105** have significantly longer resolution times compared to the others.

### Step 3: Analyze Patterns in Long-Resolution Cases

#### Case 102
- **Timeline**:
  - Receive Ticket  Triage Ticket  Assign to Level-1 Agent  Escalate to Level-2 Agent  Investigate Issue  Resolve Ticket  Close Ticket
- **Key Observations**:
  - Escalation to Level-2 Agent occurred at **11:30**, but investigation by Level-2 did not start until **14:00** (2.5-hour delay).
  - Investigation took **17 hours** (from 14:00 to 09:00 the next day).

#### Case 104
- **Timeline**:
  - Receive Ticket  Triage Ticket  Assign to Level-1 Agent  Investigate Issue  Resolve Ticket  Close Ticket
- **Key Observations**:
  - Significant delay between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (**09:30**) and "Investigate Issue" (**13:00**) – a **3.5-hour gap**.
  - Investigation took **17 hours** (from 13:00 to 08:00 the next day).

#### Case 105
- **Timeline**:
  - Receive Ticket  Triage Ticket  Assign to Level-1 Agent  Investigate Issue  Escalate to Level-2 Agent  Investigate Issue  Resolve Ticket  Close Ticket
- **Key Observations**:
  - Escalation to Level-2 Agent occurred at **10:00**, but investigation by Level-2 did not start until **14:00 the next day** (a **28-hour delay**).
  - Investigation took **17 hours** (from 14:00 to 09:00 the following day).

### Step 4: Root Causes of Performance Issues

Based on the analysis, the following patterns emerge as potential root causes of delays:

1. **Escalations to Level-2 Agents**:
   - Cases 102, 104, and 105 involved escalations to Level-2 agents.
   - Delays occurred after escalation due to slow handover processes or unavailability of Level-2 agents.

2. **Long Waiting Times Before Investigation**:
   - Cases 102, 104, and 105 experienced significant delays between assignment/investigation steps.
   - For example, Case 104 had a 3.5-hour gap between assignment and investigation.

3. **Prolonged Investigation Times**:
   - Investigation by Level-2 agents consistently took 17+ hours, suggesting inefficiencies in their workflows or insufficient resources.

4. **Lack of Clear Ownership During Handovers**:
   - Delays during escalations indicate unclear ownership or communication gaps between Level-1 and Level-2 teams.

---

### Step 5: Recommendations

To address these performance bottlenecks, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Streamline Escalation Processes**:
   - Implement automated notifications or alerts when tickets are escalated to Level-2 agents to reduce handover delays.
   - Define clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for response times during escalations.

2. **Reduce Waiting Times Between Steps**:
   - Monitor and minimize idle times between activities (e.g., assignment  investigation).
   - Use real-time dashboards to track ticket progress and identify bottlenecks.

3. **Optimize Level-2 Investigation Workflows**:
   - Analyze why investigations take so long and address underlying inefficiencies (e.g., lack of tools, training, or staffing).
   - Consider increasing the capacity of Level-2 agents or redistributing workloads.

4. **Enhance Collaboration Between Teams**:
   - Foster better communication and coordination between Level-1 and Level-2 teams through shared platforms or regular meetings.
   - Assign dedicated points of contact for escalations to ensure accountability.

5. **Implement Proactive Monitoring**:
   - Use predictive analytics to identify tickets likely to require escalation and preemptively assign them to Level-2 agents.
   - Track historical data to identify common issues and develop standardized solutions.

### Final Insights

The primary factors contributing to longer resolution times are **escalations**, **waiting times**, and **inefficient investigation processes**. By addressing these areas through streamlined workflows, improved communication, and proactive monitoring, the overall performance of the customer support process can be significantly enhanced.
