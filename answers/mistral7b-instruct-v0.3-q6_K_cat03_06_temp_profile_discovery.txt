 A temporal profile for the given process can be visualized as a flowchart with time-based stages and frequencies of each path. Here's a simplified representation:

```
Start -> Create Fine (Frequency: 20)
     |
     v
Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification (Common Subpath)
      |                           |
      v                           v
Add penalty                      Payment
         |                        |
         v                        v
Payment -> Payment              Add penalty -> Payment
           |                            |
           v                            v
Payment -> Payment -> Payment    Add penalty -> Payment -> Payment
           |                                   |
           v                                   v
Payment -> Payment -> Payment -> Payment   Appeal to Judge -> Payment
           |                                       |
           v                                       v
Send for Credit Collection        Appeal to Judge -> Send for Credit Collection
           |
           v
Notify Result Appeal to Offender  Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture
           |                               |
           v                               v
Appeal to Prefecture                Notify Result Appeal to Offender -> Payment
           |
           v
Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture
           |
           v
Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture
           |
           v
Send Appeal to Prefecture
           |
           v
Appeal to Judge
```

The frequencies given correspond to the number of times each path occurs in the provided data. This can give us an idea about the most common paths and their frequencies within the process. The total frequency is the sum of all frequencies, which represents the overall occurrence of the process. In this case, the total frequency would be 20 (Create Fine) + 11*10 (other paths) = 210 times.
