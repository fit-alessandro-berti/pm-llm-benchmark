I'll analyze the process variants and identify the main differences between the protected group and the unprotected group.

**Domestic vs. International Applicants?**
The process variants of the protected group are mostly related to making a loan to a domestic applicant, with activities like "Make Visit to Assess Colatteral" which is not observed in the process variants of the unprotected group (most probably related to International applicants which don't need such visit).

**Higher Variants for the Protected Group**
The protected group has many more process variants (20), which might indicate a more complex decision-making process, influenced by the fact that some applicants may need to provide collateral, e.g., the fact that a larger variant is present for the protected group, which includes aspects of "Make Visit to Assess Colatteral".

**Longer Processes in the Protected Group**
The protected group has several process variants that involve more steps (e.g., Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied), which might be used for applicants that have more restrictive credit conditions and require a more detailed assessment. This indicates that sanctioned customers are more likely to go through a more complex process.

**Application Rejected in the Protected Group**
In the protected group, we can see an activity named "Application Rejected", which has a relatively high frequency (960) and high execution time (219999.156 s). This could indicate that the applications of sanctioned customers are rejected more frequently, and with higher resource utilization than those of unprotected customers.

**Different Use of Resources**
Access to additional resources (colatterals), alternative methods of proving income and verification processes seem to be invoked more frequently for the protected group.

**Longer Average Processing Time**
The average processing time for the protected group seems longer, even if only some of the process variants reach a high frequency.
