Based on the given event log and the observed behavior, the following process tree captures the main flow and the optional repeating loop for missing information and re-validation:

`-> ( 'Receive Application (RA)', + ( -> ('Validate Form (VF)', 'Assess Eligibility (AE)'), * ( -> ('Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)'), -> ('Approval Decision (AD)', 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 'Archive Case (AC)'))) ) )`

This process tree represents the following:

1. The process starts with receiving an application (RA).
2. In parallel, the form is validated (VF) and the eligibility is assessed (AE).
3. If the form is valid and the applicant is eligible, the process moves on to the approval decision (AD), followed by sending the confirmation (SC) and archiving the case (AC).
4. If the form is not valid or the applicant is not eligible, a loop is entered. Within this loop, missing information is requested (RMI), the form is re-validated (VF), and the process returns to the assessment of eligibility (AE). This loop can repeat multiple times until the form is valid and the applicant is eligible.

This process tree balances fitness, precision, and simplicity, capturing the possible repetitions of requesting missing info and re-validation, as well as the main sequence of activities.
