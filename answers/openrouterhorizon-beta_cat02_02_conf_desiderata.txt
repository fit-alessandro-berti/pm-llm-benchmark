1) Normative rule violations (strict)

Case 1: No violations.
- Follows exact sequence: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.

Case 2: Violations present.
- Ordering breach: Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check (must be after Credit Check).
- Decision logic breach after rejection: Finalize Documentation performed after a Rejected decision (not allowed); the case should have been closed without finalization.
- Sequence integrity is therefore broken in two ways (ordering and contradictory action).

Case 3: No violations.
- Sequence and decision logic followed for an Approved case: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.

2) Desiderata deviations (recommended, not strict)

Case 1: Meets desiderata.
- Credit Check within 24 hours of Application.
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Decision.
- Optional Follow-up Call not recorded, but it’s only encouraged, not required.

Case 2: Mixed with normative breaches; desiderata not the main concern.
- Timing appears within recommended windows (ApplicationCredit Check within 24h, DecisionInform not logged; informing isn’t missing but in any case the main issues are strict violations).
- Any lack of Follow-up Call would be a non-issue (optional).

Case 3: Desiderata deviations present (not severe).
- Credit Check occurred ~2 days after Application (beyond the preferred 24h).
- Inform Applicant occurred ~3 days after Decision (beyond the preferred 48h).
- No Follow-up Call (optional, so merely suboptimal).

3) Possible interpretations/justifications

Case 1:
- Well-controlled, timely processing—likely standard, healthy execution.

Case 2:
- Risk Assessment before Credit Check could reflect an operator error, a misconfigured workflow, or an exploratory/preliminary risk step mistakenly logged as a formal assessment.
- Finalizing documentation after rejection might indicate misuse of the “Finalize Documentation” activity label (e.g., closing rejection paperwork mislabeled as finalization), or a training issue. Correct practice would be to close the case directly after rejection.

Case 3:
- Delays could be due to workload peaks, waiting for third-party data for the credit check, or customer unavailability affecting timely communication.
- Skipping the Follow-up Call may reflect resource constraints or confidence that formal notifications were sufficient. While suboptimal, it doesn’t breach strict rules.
