Below is an integrated event log built from the provided ERP tables. One row represents one event. Case ID = order_id. Events are ordered by Case ID and time.

Assumptions:
- One event per item pick (granular warehouse activity is meaningful for process analysis).
- Delivery events are split into “Order Dispatched” and “Order Arrived” per delivery_id.
- Payment events are attributed to the customer as the actor (no user field in Payments). 
- “Order Completed” is added when the final known payment for the order posts; resource is “System”.
- Timestamps are treated as UTC (Z). If an attribute doesn’t apply to an event, it is left blank.

Notes for process mining use:
- Case ID is the primary key for process instances. For multi-invoice/orders (e.g., 1002), all financial events are still tied to the same Case ID.
- If you prefer a single “Items Picked” event per order, you can aggregate item lines per order using the max/item_picking_date or create a start/end pick window. Here we preserved per-line granularity.
- Resources are harmonized via the Resources table where available; for payments, the Customer is used as the actor since no employee/system user is provided in the Payments table.
- You can compute additional performance metrics (e.g., order-to-cash time) by measuring between “Order Created” and the last payment per case.
