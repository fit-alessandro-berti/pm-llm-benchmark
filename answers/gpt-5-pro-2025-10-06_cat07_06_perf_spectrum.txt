- What it is: A time–event transition plot. The xaxis is time (2000–2013). The yaxis has three activities: Send Fine (top), Insert Fine Notification (middle), and Send for Credit Collection (bottom). Each thin line represents one case moving from one activity to the next at the times it occurred.

- How to read it:
  - Grey vertical lines between Send Fine and Insert Fine Notification show these two steps happen almost simultaneously for most cases (virtually no delay).
  - Pink/red diagonal lines from Insert Fine Notification down to Send for Credit Collection show the waiting time until escalation; the farther the endpoint to the right, the longer the delay.
  - The fanshaped clusters converging at the bottom indicate that many cases are sent to credit collection in large batches on a few specific dates.

- Main takeaway: The first two steps are nearly instantaneous and frequent; escalation to credit collection happens much later and in periodic batches.
