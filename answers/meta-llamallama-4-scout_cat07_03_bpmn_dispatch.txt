The provided visualization is a flowchart that illustrates the process of preparing a shipment. The flowchart is divided into three lanes: Computer Hardware Shop, Secretary, and Logistics. These lanes represent different departments or individuals involved in the process.

**Flowchart Overview**

The flowchart begins with the "Ship goods" task and ends with the "Shipment prepared" task, which is then moved to the "pickup area." 

**Initial Steps**

* The process starts with "Ship goods."
* The next step is to clarify the shipment method, which leads to a decision point: "Special handling?"
* If the answer is "no," then the package proceeds to be prepared for shipment by getting package details and writing a package label.

**Insurance Requirements**

* If insurance is required, then the customer's information is collected.
* The package is insured, and a label is written.

**Package Preparation**

* The flowchart then presents a decision point: "Check if insurance is required." 
* If the package requires special handling, then it moves to the "Package goods" step.
* The package is prepared and moved to the pickup area.

**Shipment Delay**

* If there is a delay in shipment of more than 48 hours, the customer is notified.

**Final Steps**
