### 1) Recurring activities and how meaning changes

- **Verify Documents** (recurs in C001, C003):  
  - First occurrence = *initial ID/KYC check* on the originally provided documents.  
  - Second occurrence = *re-verification* after the customer provides missing documents (C001) or after an account correction (C003).

- **Call Customer** (recurs in C002):  
  - First call = *issue-resolution / clarification call* (account discrepancy).  
  - Second call = *confirmation call* after internal adjustments are completed.

(Other activities occur once per case in this excerpt, so they don’t need disambiguation.)

### 4) Brief justification of naming choices (contextual clues)

- **Verify Documents  “Initial …” vs “Recheck …”**  
  - Clue: the second “Verify Documents” happens *after* a corrective step (either **Submit Additional** in C001 or **Adjust Account** in C003). That indicates a re-validation rather than the first-time check.

- **Call Customer  purpose-specific call names**  
  - Clue (C001): “Verification incomplete…request missing docs”  renamed to **Request Missing Documents**.  
  - Clue (C002): first call is “clarify account discrepancy” and the second is “follow-up…confirm adjustments”  renamed to **Clarify…** and **Confirm…**.  
  - Clue (C003): “Customer stepped out…call to have them return”  renamed to **Recall to Branch**.

If you want, I can apply a consistent naming convention across *all* activities (e.g., `Verb - Object - Trigger/Stage`) so the whole log is uniformly structured.
