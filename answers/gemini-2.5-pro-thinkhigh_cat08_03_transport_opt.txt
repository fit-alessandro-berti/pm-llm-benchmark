### **Executive Summary for Speedy Parcels**

This document outlines a structured, data-driven approach using process mining to address Speedy Parcels' key challenges of late deliveries and high operational costs. By integrating your rich event data from GPS, scanners, dispatch, and maintenance logs, we can move from suspicion to certainty, uncovering the hidden inefficiencies in your last-mile delivery process. Our analysis will focus on discovering your *actual* operational reality, diagnosing performance bottlenecks and their root causes, and proposing concrete, actionable strategies for optimization. The goal is to transform your data into a strategic asset that drives improved punctuality, reduced costs, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

The first step is to create a single, unified view of the entire delivery process as it truly happens.

#### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**

To create a cohesive event log, we must merge the four disparate data sources. The target structure will be a single table with three mandatory columns: `Case ID`, `Activity`, and `Timestamp`, enriched with other valuable attributes.

*   **Case ID:** The `Vehicle-Day` (e.g., `V12-20241205`) is an excellent choice for a `Case ID`. It represents a single, complete operational cycle for one vehicle, allowing us to analyze a full "day in the life" of a delivery van.
*   **Activity:** Raw events must be translated into meaningful business activities. For example:
    *   A sequence of GPS points with speed > 0 between `Depart Customer` and `Arrive Customer` becomes a single **'Travel to Next Stop'** activity.
    *   GPS data showing the vehicle is stationary (speed=0) but not at a planned stop can be classified as **'Unplanned Stop'** or, if correlated with traffic data, **'Traffic Delay'**.
    *   Scanner events like `Delivery Success` or `Delivery Failed` are already well-defined activities.
    *   Dispatch events like `Route Assigned` and maintenance logs like `Start Maintenance` will be incorporated as key milestones.
*   **Timestamp:** The timestamp for each activity is critical.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
*   **Timestamp Synchronization:** Clocks across different systems (GPS vs. Scanner) may drift. We will establish a master clock or use logical sequencing (e.g., `Arrive Customer` must precede `Delivery Success`) to order events correctly.
*   **Data Granularity:** GPS data is high-frequency, while scanner data is event-driven. We will use abstraction techniques, such as geofencing around customer locations, to correlate a high-volume of GPS pings to a single `Arrive Customer` event recorded by the scanner, creating a more accurate event log.
*   **Data Fusion:** We will link package-level events (from the scanner) to the vehicle-day case by joining on `Vehicle ID` and `Timestamp`, ensuring we can trace the journey of individual parcels within the larger vehicle process.

#### **Process Discovery: Visualizing the Actual Process**

Using process discovery algorithms (like the Heuristics Miner, which is robust against noisy data), we will generate a process map from the prepared event log. This map will visually represent the end-to-end delivery process, including:
*   The **"happy path"**: The most common sequence of activities (e.g., Depart Depot -> Travel -> Arrive -> Deliver -> Depart -> Travel...).
*   **Deviations and Rework Loops**: It will clearly show paths for `Delivery Failed` attempts, which may loop back for re-delivery later in the day or require returning the package to the depot.
*   **Unforeseen Events**: Activities like `Unscheduled Stop`, `Vehicle Breakdown`, and detours due to `Traffic Delay` will appear as distinct paths, showing how frequently they occur.

This "as-is" process model is the foundational truth of your operations.

#### **Conformance Checking: Planned vs. Actual**

We will formalize the planned routes from your dispatch system into a reference process model (a simple, linear sequence of stops). Then, we will use conformance checking to systematically compare the discovered "as-is" model against this "to-be" model. We will specifically look for:

*   **Sequence Deviations:** Drivers visiting stops in an order different from the plan (e.g., Stop 4 before Stop 3). This could be a sign of a bad plan or a driver's superior local knowledge.
*   **Unplanned Activities:** Identifying all stops and activities not in the original plan (e.g., a long lunch break, a personal stop, or an unscheduled trip to a garage).
*   **Skipped Activities:** Planned deliveries that were never attempted.
*   **Timing Deviations:** This is critical. We will measure the delta between the *planned* arrival time at a customer and the *actual* arrival time. Highlighting cases with significant delays will directly address your punctuality problem.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

With the process visualized, we can overlay performance data to pinpoint exactly where time and money are lost.

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

We will calculate the following KPIs directly from the event log to measure performance against your goals:

*   **On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate:** Percentage of deliveries where the `Arrive Customer` timestamp is within the customer-requested time window.
*   **Average Service Time per Stop:** The mean duration between `Arrive Customer` and `Depart Customer`. High variability here indicates an opportunity for standardization.
*   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** The total time spent driving versus the total time spent at customer locations. A high ratio indicates routing or traffic inefficiencies.
*   **Fuel/Energy Cost Proxy:** While direct fuel data may be absent, we can create a powerful proxy by calculating `Total Distance Travelled` (from GPS), `Engine Idle Time` (from GPS status 'moving/idle'), and instances of aggressive driving (rapid acceleration/deceleration). This helps estimate relative fuel consumption per route or driver.
*   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** The percentage of a driver's shift that the vehicle is actively used for delivery tasks (i.e., not idle at the depot or undergoing maintenance).
*   **First-Attempt Delivery Failure Rate:** The percentage of deliveries marked as `Delivery Failed`. This is a primary driver of operational cost.

#### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques**

We will use the following process mining techniques to locate bottlenecks:

*   **Duration Analysis on the Process Map:** We will enrich the process map to show the average duration of each activity (the time *in* the activity) and the transition time between them (the time *between* activities). The "hottest" or darkest-colored paths immediately reveal your biggest time sinks.
*   **Identifying Root Activities:** We can see if bottlenecks are systemic (e.g., the **'Morning Loading at Depot'** activity is always slow for everyone) or contextual.
*   **Contextual Filtering:** By filtering the process map and KPIs by **time of day, driver, vehicle type, or geographic area**, we can isolate specific bottlenecks. For example:
    *   *Are travel times significantly longer between 4 PM and 6 PM?* -> **Time-based bottleneck.**
    *   *Does "Driver D108" consistently have longer service times than others?* -> **Driver-specific bottleneck.**
    *   *Do deliveries in the city center have extremely long "parking" times (i.e., time between `Arrive Customer` and `Scan Package`)?* -> **Location-based bottleneck.**

Quantifying the impact is simple: if the average duration of 'Travel in Downtown' is 25 minutes, while 'Travel in Suburbs' is 8 minutes for a similar distance, we have quantified the bottleneck's impact on throughput time.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

Identifying a bottleneck is only half the battle. We must understand *why* it exists.

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
    *   **Analysis:** We use variant analysis to compare the performance of routes where drivers strictly followed the plan versus routes where they deviated. If deviated routes are consistently faster, it proves the dispatch system's logic is flawed.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** This points to a root cause of **static and unrealistic route plans**.

*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
    *   **Analysis:** We compare the dispatch system's estimated travel time for a route segment against the actual travel time calculated from GPS timestamps.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** If we find systematic underestimation for travel in the city center during rush hour, we validate that the **routing engine lacks sophisticated, time-aware traffic prediction**.

*   **High Variability in Service Time:**
    *   **Analysis:** We will create a dotted chart, which visualizes the timing and duration of activities across many cases. This can reveal patterns, such as consistently long service times for apartment buildings versus single-family homes.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** This helps isolate causes like **parking difficulty, building access issues, or time spent finding the correct apartment/office**, which are not accounted for in planning.

*   **Impact of Vehicle Breakdowns:**
    *   **Analysis:** We filter the entire event log for cases containing a `Start Unscheduled Maintenance` event. We then compare the KPIs (total shift duration, OTD rate, costs) of this group against the average.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** If these cases show drastically worse performance, and we correlate them with specific vehicle models or ages, we validate that a **reactive maintenance strategy** is a significant root cause of inefficiency.

*   **Failed Delivery Attempts:**
    *   **Analysis:** We analyze the attributes of `Delivery Failed` events. What time of day do they occur? Are they more common for residential or business addresses? What reason is given?
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** If most failures occur between 1-3 PM at residential addresses, the root cause is likely a **mismatch between delivery schedules and customer availability**.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

Based on the root cause analysis, we propose the following data-driven strategies:

#### **Strategy 1: Implement Dynamic, Data-Informed Route Optimization**

*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Suboptimal routes, inaccurate travel times, and traffic-related delays.
*   **Root Cause Addressed:** Static routing plans that do not reflect real-world conditions.
*   **Data-Driven Proposal:**
    1.  **Enrich Planning Data:** Use the historical travel times calculated by process mining to replace the static, unrealistic estimates in your dispatch system. Create a "digital twin" of your network's travel times, segmented by time-of-day and day-of-week.
    2.  **Implement Dynamic Re-routing:** Integrate a real-time traffic API (e.g., Google Maps, Waze) with your dispatch system. If a driver's route is impacted by a newly formed traffic jam, the system should automatically evaluate and suggest a faster alternative route, while still respecting upcoming time windows.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:**
    *   **Increase** On-Time Delivery Rate.
    *   **Decrease** Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio.
    *   **Decrease** Fuel Consumption per delivery due to less idling and shorter distances.

#### **Strategy 2: Proactive Customer Communication to Reduce Failed Deliveries**

*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** High rate of failed first-attempt deliveries.
*   **Root Cause Addressed:** Mismatch between driver arrival and customer availability.
*   **Data-Driven Proposal:**
    1.  **Create Geofenced ETAs:** Use the vehicle's real-time GPS location. When a driver enters a 15-minute travel-time radius of the next stop (calculated from your new, more accurate travel model), automatically trigger an SMS/email to the customer with a precise ETA: "Your Speedy Parcels driver is about 15 minutes away!"
    2.  **Enable In-flight Options:** Include a link in the notification that allows the customer to provide last-minute instructions (e.g., "Leave with neighbor," "Safe place behind the planter") to prevent a failed attempt.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:**
    *   **Significantly Decrease** First-Attempt Delivery Failure Rate.
    *   **Increase** Customer Satisfaction.
    *   **Reduce** operational costs associated with storing and re-delivering parcels.

#### **Strategy 3: Develop a Predictive Maintenance Program**

*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Unscheduled vehicle breakdowns during shifts.
*   **Root Cause Addressed:** A purely reactive maintenance schedule.
*   **Data-Driven Proposal:**
    1.  **Model Vehicle Stress:** Correlate maintenance log events (`Unscheduled Repair`) with operational data from the event log for each vehicle. Build a "stress score" based on factors like total kilometers driven, hours of engine idle time (high in city traffic), and number of stops (engine on/off cycles).
    2.  **Create Predictive Triggers:** Analyze the data to find thresholds. For example, "Vans of Model Y typically require brake servicing after 800 hours of heavy-urban-cycle operation." Schedule maintenance proactively when a vehicle approaches this data-derived threshold, not just based on mileage or time.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:**
    *   **Decrease** the frequency of costly in-shift breakdowns.
    *   **Increase** Vehicle Utilization Rate and overall fleet reliability.
    *   **Reduce** overtime costs caused by breakdown-related delays.

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

Optimization must exist within the boundaries of reality. Our final step ensures sustainability.

#### **Accounting for Operational Constraints:**

All proposed strategies will be designed to respect your core operational constraints:
*   **Driver Working Hours:** Any dynamic re-routing suggestion will be validated against the driver's remaining legal shift time to prevent compliance violations.
*   **Vehicle Capacities:** Route sequences and package loads must continue to respect the physical volume and weight limits of each van.
*   **Customer Time Windows:** The optimization algorithms will treat meeting committed delivery time windows as a primary, hard constraint, ensuring that efficiency gains do not come at the expense of customer promises.

#### **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:**

Implementation is not the end. We will establish a continuous monitoring framework using process mining dashboards. These dashboards will provide at-a-glance insights for your operations managers, tracking:

*   **KPI Scorecards:** Trend lines for OTD Rate, Failed Delivery Rate, and Average Cost per Delivery, allowing you to see the impact of your changes over time.
*   **Conformance Dashboard:** A live view comparing the new, optimized routes against driver execution. This helps identify if drivers are adopting the new plans or if the plans still need refinement.
*   **Bottleneck Monitor:** A process map view that automatically highlights emerging bottlenecks, allowing you to be proactive about solving the *next* problem before it impacts performance.

This transforms process mining from a one-time project into a continuous, strategic management tool for operational excellence at Speedy Parcels.
