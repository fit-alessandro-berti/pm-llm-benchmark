### **Executive Summary for Speedy Parcels**

This document outlines a process mining-driven methodology to address Speedy Parcels' core challenges of late deliveries and high operational costs. By integrating your rich data from GPS, scanners, dispatch, and maintenance logs, we can move from suspicion to certainty, creating a transparent, data-backed view of your entire last-mile delivery operation. Our approach will focus on discovering the *actual* processes, checking them against your plans, identifying the precise location and impact of bottlenecks, performing a root cause analysis, and delivering concrete, actionable strategies for optimization. The final phase involves establishing a continuous monitoring framework to ensure sustained improvement.

### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

The foundation of our analysis is creating a unified, accurate view of your operations.

#### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**

The primary task is to merge the four disparate data sources into a single, cohesive event log.

*   **Case ID Definition:** We will primarily use `Case ID = Vehicle-Day` (e.g., 'V12-20241205') to analyze the entire operational day of a single vehicle. This allows us to see the full process from depot to depot. For package-specific analysis (like tracking failed deliveries), `Package ID` will be used as a secondary Case ID.
*   **Activity Definition (Activity Abstraction):** The 'Activity' column will be standardized. Events like `Depart Depot`, `Arrive Customer`, `Delivery Success`, and `Arrive Depot` are clear. We will derive crucial intermediate activities:
    *   **'Travel to Customer':** Inferred as the duration between a `Depart` event (from depot or previous customer) and an `Arrive Customer` event.
    *   **'Service at Stop':** The time between `Arrive Customer` and `Depart Customer`.
    *   **'Idle/Dwell Time':** Identified from GPS data where the vehicle is stationary but not at a known customer or depot location.
    *   **'Unscheduled Maintenance':** Correlating `Unscheduled Stop` from GPS with `Maintenance Logs`.
*   **Timestamp Unification:** All timestamps will be converted to a single format and timezone (e.g., UTC) to ensure correct sequencing and duration calculations.
*   **Data Enrichment:** We will join the event log with contextual data. For example, every event will be enriched with `Driver ID`, `Vehicle ID`, `Vehicle Capacity`, `Planned Stops` (from Dispatch), and `Customer Time Window`.

**Potential Challenges:**
*   **Timestamp Misalignment:** Clocks on different systems (GPS vs. Scanner) may be slightly out of sync. We will implement a logical sequencing rule to correct minor discrepancies.
*   **Data Granularity:** GPS provides high-frequency data, while scanner events are discrete. We will need to develop rules to correlate a cluster of GPS points with a single scanner event (e.g., spatial-temporal clustering to define an "at-stop" zone).
*   **Missing Data:** A driver forgetting to scan at a milestone. We will use GPS data to infer missing `Arrive`/`Depart` events where possible.

#### **Process Discovery**

Using an algorithm like the Inductive Miner, we will generate a process model (a visual flowchart) of your *actual* end-to-end delivery process. This "as-is" model will likely be a complex "spaghetti model" at first, but it will reveal:
*   The primary "happy path" of a successful delivery day.
*   Common variations, such as the `Delivery Failed -> Re-attempt Later` loop.
*   Infrequent but high-impact deviations like `Unscheduled Stop -> Maintenance`.
*   Unplanned activities like long idle times or deviations from the planned route.

#### **Conformance Checking**

We will formally compare the discovered "as-is" process with the "to-be" model derived from your **Dispatch System's planned routes**. By replaying the actual event log on the planned model, we can systematically identify and quantify deviations:

*   **Sequence Deviations:** Drivers visiting stops in an order different from the plan. We can analyze if these deviations are beneficial (e.g., adapting to traffic) or detrimental.
*   **Unplanned Stops:** Identifying stops that were not in the dispatch plan (e.g., unauthorized breaks, trips for fuel, maintenance issues).
*   **Skipped Stops:** Packages that were on the manifest but never had an `Arrive Customer` event, indicating they were missed or brought back to the depot.
*   **Timing Deviations:** Highlighting significant differences between planned vs. actual travel and service times. A 10-minute planned travel segment that consistently takes 25 minutes is a major red flag for the planning system's accuracy.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

With a reliable process model, we can now overlay performance data to find exactly where time and money are lost.

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

We will calculate the following KPIs directly from the event log:
*   **On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate:** Percentage of successful deliveries completed within the customer-requested time window. (Calculated from `Delivery Success` timestamp vs. Dispatch `Time Window`).
*   **Average Service Time per Stop:** `Timestamp('Depart Customer') - Timestamp('Arrive Customer')`. We can segment this by location type, driver, or time of day.
*   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** The proportion of a driver's shift spent driving vs. interacting with customers. A high ratio points to routing or traffic issues.
*   **First-Attempt Delivery Rate (FADR):** Percentage of deliveries that are successful on the first try. (`Delivery Success` events / (`Delivery Success` + `Delivery Failed`) events).
*   **Excessive Idling Time:** Sum of durations where vehicle status is 'idle' for more than a defined threshold (e.g., 3 minutes), a direct proxy for wasted fuel.
*   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** (Total Travel Time + Total Service Time) / Total Shift Duration. Low utilization indicates operational slack or downtime.
*   **Frequency/Impact of Traffic Delays:** Quantifying delays by analyzing `Low Speed Detected` events and comparing actual vs. planned travel times on specific road segments.

#### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques**

We will use performance overlays on the process map to make bottlenecks visible.
*   **Duration Analysis:** The map will show activities and paths colored by their average duration. Long travel arcs between two nearby stops or long waits at the `Arrive Customer` activity immediately highlight time sinks.
*   **Frequency Analysis:** We can see which paths are most common. A high-frequency path leading to `Delivery Failed` is a critical issue.
*   **Resource & Time-Based Filtering:** We will analyze performance segmented by different factors to pinpoint the bottleneck's context:
    *   **Routes/Zones:** Are delays concentrated in specific geographic areas (e.g., downtown core)?
    *   **Time of Day:** Do bottlenecks correspond with morning/evening rush hours?
    *   **Drivers/Vehicles:** Are certain drivers consistently slower? Do older vehicles have more unplanned stops?
    *   **Customer Type:** Do deliveries to high-rise apartments take significantly longer than to suburban homes?

We will quantify the impact by calculating the total time lost. For example: "The average service time at commercial buildings is 7 minutes longer than at residential addresses, impacting 20% of all stops and accounting for 1,200 lost operational hours over six months."

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

Identifying a bottleneck is the "what"; root cause analysis is the "why".

| Potential Inefficiency         | Potential Root Cause(s)                                                                  | Process Mining Analysis to Validate                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Travel Times**          | 1. Suboptimal static route planning. <br> 2. Inaccurate travel time estimations. <br> 3. Traffic congestion. | **Conformance Checking:** Compare planned vs. actual routes and timings. <br> **Geospatial Analysis:** Overlay long travel times on a map with known traffic hotspots. <br> **Correlation:** Correlate delays with time of day. |
| **High Service Times**         | 1. Difficulty finding parking. <br> 2. Long walking distance (large campuses/apartments). <br> 3. Customer not ready. | **Dwell Time Analysis:** Analyze GPS data for vehicle movement *at the stop location* before the `Arrive Customer` scan to infer parking search time. <br> **Variant Analysis:** Compare service times by property type. |
| **High Failed Delivery Rate**  | 1. Inconvenient delivery times for customers. <br> 2. Inaccurate address data. <br> 3. No access to building/gate. | **Analysis of Notes:** Text-mine the 'Notes' field on `Delivery Failed` events. <br> **Correlation Analysis:** Correlate failed deliveries with specific time windows (e.g., midday for residential areas) and customer types. |
| **Frequent Vehicle Breakdowns** | 1. Reactive maintenance schedule. <br> 2. Aging fleet. <br> 3. Harsh driving behavior.        | **Correlation Analysis:** Correlate `Unscheduled Stop` events with vehicle age, mileage since last service, and driver ID. Analyze GPS speed/acceleration data for signs of aggressive driving.    |
| **Driver Performance Gaps**    | 1. Lack of training. <br> 2. Non-adherence to process. <br> 3. Skill/experience differences.   | **Variant Analysis:** Compare the process models of top-performing drivers vs. low-performing drivers. Do top performers have shorter service times, fewer sequence deviations, or less idle time?      |

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

Based on the analysis, we propose the following concrete strategies:

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic and Historically-Informed Route Optimization**
*   **Target:** Excessive travel time, high fuel consumption, and poor OTD rate.
*   **Root Cause:** Over-reliance on static routes and inaccurate travel time estimations in the planning phase.
*   **Proposal:**
    1.  **Enrich the Routing Engine:** Export the aggregated, actual travel times between key segments from our process mining analysis. Use this historical data to replace the routing engine's default/standard travel time estimates with realistic, time-of-day-dependent predictions.
    2.  **Implement Limited Dynamic Re-routing:** Develop business rules that trigger a re-route suggestion to the driver's handheld device if a real-time traffic alert or a detected delay on their current path jeopardizes a future delivery's time window.
*   **Data Support & Expected Impact:** Conformance checking will have shown where planned vs. actual travel times diverge the most. By feeding this back into the system, we expect to see a **10-15% reduction in total travel time**, improved **OTD rate**, and lower **fuel costs**.

#### **Strategy 2: Proactive Customer Communication to Reduce Failed Deliveries**
*   **Target:** High rate of failed deliveries and long service times at the stop.
*   **Root Cause:** Customer not being available or prepared at the time of delivery.
*   **Proposal:**
    1.  **Predictive ETA Notifications:** Use the now-accurate travel time model to provide customers with a narrower, more reliable delivery window.
    2.  **"You're Next" Alerts:** Implement an automated SMS/app notification to the customer when the driver marks their previous stop as complete. This message ("Your Speedy Parcels delivery will arrive in approx. 10-15 minutes") prompts the customer to be ready.
*   **Data Support & Expected Impact:** Our analysis of `Delivery Failed` reasons will confirm "Customer Not Home" is a primary driver. This strategy directly addresses it. We expect to increase the **First-Attempt Delivery Rate (FADR) by over 20%**, which drastically reduces costly re-delivery attempts.

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**
*   **Target:** Unscheduled vehicle downtime, high emergency repair costs, and associated delivery delays.
*   **Root Cause:** A purely reactive or mileage-based maintenance schedule that ignores actual operational stress.
*   **Proposal:**
    1.  **Develop a Vehicle "Stress Score":** Create a composite score for each vehicle based on data from the event log: total engine idle time, number of engine starts/stops (i.e., number of deliveries), and routes driven (e.g., classify routes as high-stress based on hills or stop-and-go traffic patterns).
    2.  **Trigger Proactive Maintenance:** Instead of servicing at 10,000 km, a vehicle might be flagged for proactive inspection when its "Stress Score" crosses a certain threshold, even if its mileage is lower.
*   **Data Support & Expected Impact:** Our root cause analysis will have correlated breakdowns with these stress factors. This strategy moves from a lagging indicator (mileage) to leading indicators (operational stress). We expect to **reduce in-shift breakdowns by over 50%**, increasing **vehicle uptime** and cutting emergency repair costs.

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

#### **Accounting for Constraints**
All proposed strategies must operate within real-world limits. Our models and recommendations will explicitly incorporate:
*   **Driver Working Hours:** Dynamic re-routing suggestions will be constrained by legal Hours of Service (HOS) to prevent overtime or violations.
*   **Vehicle Capacities:** Route optimizations will always respect the physical and weight capacity of the assigned vehicle.
*   **Customer Time Windows:** This is a hard constraint. The goal of optimization is to meet these windows *more efficiently*, not to violate them. The OTD rate remains a primary success metric.

#### **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**
Implementation is not the end. We will set up a series of process mining dashboards for continuous monitoring:

*   **Operational Health Dashboard:** Tracks key KPIs (OTD Rate, FADR, Cost per Delivery, Vehicle Utilization) over time to measure the impact of our changes.
*   **Conformance Dashboard:** Continuously tracks the rate and type of deviations from the (now improved) plan. A rising deviation rate could be an early warning of a new problem.
*   **Bottleneck Monitoring View:** A live process map with performance overlays that allows managers to see if the old bottlenecks are gone and, more importantly, if new ones have emerged elsewhere in the process (e.g., is the depot loading process now the main delay?).
*   **Resource Performance Leaderboard:** A dashboard (used constructively for training) showing driver and vehicle performance against the key efficiency metrics, helping to standardize best practices.

By adopting this holistic, data-driven approach, Speedy Parcels can transform its operations from a reactive cost center into a proactive, efficient, and reliable delivery machine.
