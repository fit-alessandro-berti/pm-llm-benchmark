# Process Mining Strategy for Speedy Parcels: Optimization & Analysis

**Consultant:** [Your Name/Firm]
**Client:** Speedy Parcels
**Objective:** Improve delivery punctuality and reduce operational costs (fuel/maintenance) via data-driven process mining.

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration
The critical first step is creating a unified **Event Log**. Since raw GPS data is continuous and scanner data is discrete, we must bridge the gap between IoT streams and transactional logs.

*   **Case ID Definition:** The primary Case ID will be the **`Vehicle-Day`** (e.g., `V12-20241205`). This encapsulates one full delivery shift.
*   **Integration Strategy:**
    *   **GPS Abstraction:** Raw GPS pings (Lat/Lon/Speed) must be converted into discrete events. We will generate events such as *'Travel Started'*, *'Traffic Delay Detected'* (speed < 5km/h for > 5 mins), and *'Vehicle Idle'* (Ignition On, Speed 0).
    *   **Data Merging:** We will join Dispatch (Planned), Scanner (Actual Execution), Maintenance (Interruptions), and GPS (Context) based on Timestamp and Vehicle ID.
    *   **Geofencing:** We will validate Scanner events against GPS coordinates to create a *'Location Verified'* attribute.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   *Clock Drift:* Synchronization issues between handheld scanners and vehicle GPS units.
    *   *Granularity:* Managing the massive volume of GPS data versus the sparse scanner data.
    *   *Ghost Events:* Drivers forgetting to scan 'Depart' or 'Arrive', requiring us to infer these events based on GPS location dwell time.

### Process Discovery
Using algorithms like the **Inductive Miner** or **Heuristic Miner** (which handle noise well), we will visualize the *actual* "As-Is" process.

*   **Visualization:** The model will show the flow from *Start Shift* $\rightarrow$ *Load Vehicle* $\rightarrow$ *Travel* $\rightarrow$ *Park* $\rightarrow$ *Scan/Deliver* $\rightarrow$ *Return to Vehicle* $\rightarrow$ *Travel*.
*   **Hidden Activities:** Crucially, by integrating GPS, the process map will reveal "hidden" steps that the scanner misses, such as *'Search for Parking'* (circling a block at low speed) or *'Unscheduled Idle'* (driver stopped for 15 mins without a scanner event).
*   **Deviations:** We will visually distinguish between "Standard Delivery" paths and "Exception" paths (e.g., *Delivery Failed* $\rightarrow$ *Re-attempt* or *Vehicle Breakdown* $\rightarrow$ *Wait for Tow*).

### Conformance Checking
We will compare the discovered model against the *Planned Route* from the Dispatch System.

*   **Sequence Deviations:** Did the driver follow the optimized stop order? (e.g., Did they visit Stop 5 before Stop 2, breaking the route logic?)
*   **Time Window Violations:** Comparing *'Planned Arrival Window'* vs. *'Actual Scan Time'*.
*   **Unplanned Stops:** Identifying stops recorded by GPS (dwell time > 5 mins) that have no corresponding package scan or break log.
*   **Route Adherence:** Overlaying the actual GPS track against the planned path to calculate route deviation percentage.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
We will calculate these KPIs directly from the enriched event log:

1.  **On-Time Delivery Rate:** % of *'Delivery Success'* events occurring within the *'Customer Time Window'*.
2.  **Service Time Variance:** Duration between *'Arrive Customer'* and *'Depart Customer'*.
3.  **Travel vs. Service Ratio:** Total time spent in *'Travel'* status vs. *'Delivery/Service'* status.
4.  **Fuel Efficiency Proxy:** Correlating *'Speed/RPM'* (from GPS) and total distance with fuel logs to calculate Fuel/Stop.
5.  **First-Time Right (FTR):** Ratio of *'Delivery Success'* to total delivery attempts.
6.  **Turnaround Time:** Time from *'Arrive Depot'* (morning) to *'Depart Depot'*.

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques
*   **Dotted Chart Analysis:** We will plot all Case IDs (Vehicle-Days) over a 24-hour timeline. This will visually reveal:
    *   **Depot Bottlenecks:** If all lines start late (e.g., 08:30 instead of 07:30), the bottleneck is warehouse loading, not the drivers.
    *   **Time-of-Day Congestion:** If delivery rates slow down universally between 16:00-17:00, this confirms systemic traffic issues.
*   **Performance Spectrum:** We will visualize the speed of flow between specific process steps (e.g., Depot $\rightarrow$ Stop 1). If the segment *'Stop 10'* $\rightarrow$ *'Stop 11'* consistently takes 2x longer than planned across all drivers, the dispatch routing engine has bad map data for that sector.
*   **Resource Utilization:** Analyzing Driver and Vehicle utilization to see if delays are caused by resource shortages (waiting for a functional van) or capacity issues.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

We will use **Influence Analysis** and **Root Cause Mining** (decision trees) to explain *why* deviations occur.

*   **Root Cause 1: Inaccurate Route Planning (Static vs. Dynamic)**
    *   *Analysis:* Compare *Planned Travel Time* vs. *Actual GPS Travel Time*.
    *   *Insight:* If the variance is high specifically during rush hour, the routing software is using static speed limits rather than dynamic traffic profiles.
*   **Root Cause 2: Parking & Service Time Variability**
    *   *Analysis:* Correlate *'Service Time'* (dwell time) with *'Location Density'*.
    *   *Insight:* We may find that delays aren't on the road, but "at the door." For example, high-rise apartments may have a 12-minute average service time vs. 2 minutes for suburban houses, but the schedule allocates 5 minutes for both.
*   **Root Cause 3: Driver Behavior & Fuel Costs**
    *   *Analysis:* Filter for *'Low Speed Detected'* or *'Idle'* events. Correlate these with specific Driver IDs.
    *   *Insight:* Driver A finishes routes fast but has high fuel consumption (aggressive driving). Driver B is slow because they spend 20% of the shift idling with AC on (fuel waste).
*   **Root Cause 4: Failed Deliveries**
    *   *Analysis:* Analyze the timestamp of *'Delivery Failed'* events.
    *   *Insight:* If 80% of failures happen between 09:00-11:00 AM in residential zones, the root cause is scheduling deliveries when customers are at work.
*   **Root Cause 5: Maintenance Reliability**
    *   *Analysis:* Correlate *'Unscheduled Stops'* with *Vehicle Age* and *Maintenance Logs*.
    *   *Insight:* Are breakdowns random, or do they cluster around vehicles that missed their preventative maintenance window by >1 week?

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Based on the potential insights, here are three targeted strategies:

### Strategy A: Dynamic "Reality-Based" Routing Updates
*   **Target:** Suboptimal Route Planning & Late Deliveries.
*   **Root Cause:** The Dispatch system relies on theoretical speeds, not actual conditions.
*   **Proposal:** Feed the *Actual Travel Times* and *Actual Service Times* discovered via process mining back into the routing algorithm. If the logs show that traversing "Main St." takes 20 mins at 5 PM (vs. planned 10 mins), the system must adjust. Furthermore, update "Service Time" parameters based on building type (e.g., allocate 10 mins for high-rises, 3 mins for houses).
*   **Expected Impact:** Improved *On-Time Delivery Rate* and realistic driver schedules, reducing overtime costs.

### Strategy B: Predictive "Customer Presence" Windows
*   **Target:** High Fuel Costs & Low First-Time Right Rate (Redeliveries).
*   **Root Cause:** Delivering when customers are statistically likely to be away.
*   **Proposal:** Use the historic event log to identify time windows with high *'Delivery Success'* rates for specific neighborhoods. Restructure route sequences to visit residential areas during high-probability windows (e.g., early morning or late afternoon) and commercial areas during mid-day.
*   **Expected Impact:** Reduction in *Failed Deliveries*, leading to fewer re-delivery attempts, lower fuel consumption per package, and higher customer satisfaction.

### Strategy C: Eco-Driving & Predictive Maintenance Program
*   **Target:** Rising Fuel & Maintenance Costs.
*   **Root Cause:** Aggressive driving, excessive idling, and reactive repairs.
*   **Proposal:**
    1.  **Driver Training:** Create "Driver Scorecards" based on GPS events (Idling time, Hard Braking, Speeding). Gamify improvements to encourage fuel-efficient driving.
    2.  **Predictive Maintenance:** Trigger maintenance tickets automatically when Process Mining detects specific patterns (e.g., a slight degradation in average speed or MPG over a week) rather than waiting for a breakdown or fixed mileage interval.
*   **Expected Impact:** Reduced *Fuel Consumption*, extended vehicle lifespan, and fewer *Unscheduled Stops* (breakdowns).

## 5. Operational Constraints and Monitoring

### Managing Constraints
*   **Union/Labor Rules:** Optimization must respect maximum driving hours. If "Reality-Based Routing" reveals a route actually takes 10 hours but is planned for 8, the route must be split or assigned a helper, rather than forcing the driver to speed.
*   **Capacity:** If optimizing for "Customer Presence" concentrates too many deliveries in the evening window, we must balance this against van capacity. We may need to deploy "wave" deliveries (reload at depot) or smaller, more agile fleets for evening shifts.

### Continuous Monitoring (The "Control" Phase)
We will implement a **Process Mining Dashboard** (using tools like Celonis, UiPath, or Fluxicon Disco) connected to the live data stream.

**Key Views to Monitor:**
1.  **The "Pulse" Dashboard:** Real-time view of active vehicles. Alerts triggered if a vehicle deviates from the planned route sequence or dwells in one location >15 mins.
2.  **Conformance Checker:** Weekly report showing the % of routes that adhered to the plan. High deviation suggests the plan is becoming obsolete.
3.  **Cost-to-Serve Monitor:** A metric combining Fuel + Labor Time + Maintenance divided by Packages Delivered. An upward trend triggers an immediate deep-dive.

By moving from reactive analysis to continuous monitoring, Speedy Parcels can transition from "putting out fires" to a proactive, optimized logistics operation.
