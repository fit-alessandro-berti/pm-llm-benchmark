### **Assumptions & Notes**:
1. **Order 1004**: No invoice or payment data found, so those events are excluded.
2. **Activity Names**:  
   - `Items Picked`: Created per line item, with picker details from the `Resources` table.  
   - `Order Dispatched/Arrived`: Generated per delivery record (e.g., order 1002 has two deliveries, resulting in four events).  
3. **Resource Mapping**:  
   - Salespersons, warehouse staff, carriers, and billers are mapped using the `Resources` table.  
   - Missing `Resource` entries (e.g., payment methods) are left empty.  
4. **Additional Attributes**:  
   - Included relevant fields (e.g., `item_id`, `quantity`, `carrier_id`, `payment_method`).  
5. **Chronological Order**: Events are listed in the order they occurred within each case.  

This log integrates all process steps from order creation to payment, adhering to the requirements for clarity and process mining suitability.
