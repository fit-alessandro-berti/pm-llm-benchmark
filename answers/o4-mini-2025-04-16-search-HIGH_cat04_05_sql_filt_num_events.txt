Here are three equivalent ways to return only those events whose `case_id` has at most six events in total. You can pick whichever style you prefer—subquery, CTE, or windowfunction—depending on readability or coding conventions:

1. Using a correlated INsubquery  
```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log AS el
WHERE el.case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```
– The inner query groups by `case_id` and keeps only those with a count  6.  
– The outer query then selects all rows from `event_log` whose `case_id` is in that list.

2. Using a common table expression (CTE)  
```sql
WITH short_cases AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log AS el
JOIN short_cases AS sc
  ON el.case_id = sc.case_id;
```
– The CTE `short_cases` materializes the set of case IDs with  6 events.  
– A simple join brings back all events for those cases.

3. Using a window function  
```sql
SELECT case_id,
       activity,
       timestamp
FROM (
  SELECT *,
         COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count
  FROM event_log
) AS sub
WHERE event_count <= 6;
```
– `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)` annotates each row with the total events for its case.  
– The outer filter keeps only rows where that total is  6.

All three yield the full set of events for cases with no more than six occurrences.
