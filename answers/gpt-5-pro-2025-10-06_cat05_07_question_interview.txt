Below is a focused set of open-ended questions to deepen understanding of your property onboarding process. They are grouped by topic to make discussion easier.

Intake and eligibility
- How do landlords initiate onboarding, and what information do you require to open a case?
- What prerequisites must be satisfied before a property is considered eligible to proceed (e.g., signed management agreement, service tier selection)?
- How do you segment properties at intake (by type, location, regulatory regime), and how does that segmentation change the process path?
- Under what conditions would you place an intake on hold or decline it, and who makes that decision?

Documentation and verification
- What document set do you require by property type and jurisdiction, and how do you manage regional variations?
- How do you verify authenticity, completeness, and recency of each document, and who signs off?
- What is your process and cadence for chasing missing or outdated documents, including escalation thresholds?
- How do you handle documents that contain sensitive data from a privacy and retention standpoint?

Data capture and status control
- Which property attributes are mandatory versus optional at onboarding, and what standards ensure consistency across regions?
- Who is the authoritative owner of key fields (amenities, pet policy, pricing range), and how are updates controlled after initial entry?
- What statuses can a property move through during onboarding, and what are the entry/exit criteria for each status?

Assignment of property manager
- How do you evaluate property manager capacity and fit (workload, geography, experience) when assigning a new property?
- In what scenarios do you override the standard assignment logic, and what approvals are required?
- How do you handle reassignments after kickoff, and how is the handoff documented to avoid loss of context?

Kickoff and expectation alignment
- What is the standard agenda for the expectation-alignment meeting with the landlord, and what decisions must be captured?
- How do you document and approve special conditions or custom policies requested by the landlord?
- How do you set, communicate, and track the initial timeline and milestones agreed with the landlord?

Inspections, photography, and repairs
- How do you schedule and prioritize inspections and photography, and what SLAs apply to each?
- What inspection standards or checklists do you use, and how do you determine pass, conditional pass, or fail?
- How are remediation scopes, budgets, and vendor selections defined and approved when issues are found?
- How do you manage access constraints (occupied units, limited hours) and coordinate reinspections?

Marketing and pricing
- What criteria must be met before marketing can begin, and who approves listing content and imagery?
- How do you determine initial pricing and concessions, and what inputs or reviews are required?
- How do you incorporate landlord feedback or requested edits to listings without compromising brand and compliance?

Activation and go-live
- How do you define the property’s “activation” state, and what checklist or signoffs gate that step?
- How do you ensure all systems reflect the same activation status and prevent premature or duplicate activations?

Tenant screening and selection
- What screening criteria and thresholds do you apply, and how do you balance standardized rules with manager discretion?
- How do you handle complex applicant scenarios (co-applicants, guarantors, international students) while maintaining compliance?

Lease execution and move-in
- What lease templates exist by jurisdiction/property type, and how are deviations reviewed and approved?
- How are security deposits and fees determined, collected, and held in compliance with local laws?
- What is your move-in readiness checklist (keys, utilities, condition report), and who is responsible for each item?

Quality checks and audits
- At what points do compliance, finance, and IT perform their reviews, and are they gating or retrospective?
- What happens when a post-activation audit flags an issue, and who owns remediation and stakeholder communication?

Communication, coordination, and ownership
- What is the single source of truth for status, decisions, and artifacts, and how is it kept current?
- How do you coordinate handoffs across regional offices and shared services, and what are the defined roles and responsibilities?
- What are your escalation paths when landlords or internal stakeholders are unresponsive or in disagreement?

Timelines, SLAs, and capacity
- What are your target cycle times and SLAs for each stage, and how do you measure adherence?
- Where are the most common bottlenecks or rework points, and what typically causes them?
- How do you forecast and manage capacity for property managers, inspectors, and marketing resources, especially during seasonal spikes?

Exceptions and special cases
- How do you handle properties subject to special regulations or programs (rent control, Section 8, short-term rental permits)?
- How do you manage landlord requests for custom lease clauses that conflict with standard policy?
- What steps do you follow if a landlord pauses or withdraws mid-onboarding, including fees, communications, and record closure?

Data integrity and privacy
- How do you prevent data inconsistencies across systems and reconcile conflicts between landlord inputs and inspection findings?
- What privacy, consent, and retention policies govern landlord and applicant data collected during onboarding?

Metrics and continuous improvement
- Which KPIs define onboarding success (e.g., time-to-activation, audit pass rate, first-tenant lead time, landlord satisfaction), and who reviews them?
- How do you capture lessons learned from exceptions or delays and translate them into process or policy changes?

Definition of done and handover
- Precisely when do you consider onboarding complete, and what artifacts are required to close the case?
- How do you transition the property from onboarding to ongoing management, and what acceptance criteria must operations confirm?

Risk management and governance
- How do you categorize and score risk for properties and landlords, and how does risk tiering change the process?
- What approvals or signoffs are required at key risk gates, and how are exceptions documented and justified?

Vendor management
- How do you select, evaluate, and rotate photographers, inspectors, and contractors, and what performance measures do you track?
