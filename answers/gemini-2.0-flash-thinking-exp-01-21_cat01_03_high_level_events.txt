**Proposed High-Level Activities:**

Based on the provided event log sample, we can group the low-level events into the following high-level process steps:

1.  **Material Preparation:**
    -   **Low-level events:**
        -   Retrieve raw metal sheet
        -   Scan barcode
        -   Place metal sheet on table
        -   Align metal sheet
        -   Preheat metal sheet
    -   **Rationale:** These events are sequentially performed at the beginning of the process and are all related to preparing the raw material (metal sheet) for subsequent manufacturing steps. They involve fetching the material, identifying it, positioning it, and bringing it to the required temperature for further processing.
    -   **Name:** Material Preparation

2.  **Welding:**
    -   **Low-level events:**
        -   Pick up welding tool
        -   Weld corner A
        -   Weld corner B
    -   **Rationale:** These events are centered around the core assembly process of welding.  They involve tool setup and the execution of welding operations on specific parts of the metal sheet. The activities are logically connected to join components.
    -   **Name:** Welding

3.  **Weld Quality Check:**
    -   **Low-level events:**
        -   Measure weld integrity
    -   **Rationale:** This event directly follows the welding step and is focused on assessing the quality of the weld. It's a crucial quality control step to ensure the integrity of the assembled part immediately after welding.
    -   **Name:** Weld Quality Check

4.  **Coating Process:**
    -   **Low-level events:**
        -   Apply protective coating
        -   Dry coating
    -   **Rationale:** These events are related to applying a protective layer to the product. They form a distinct stage of surface treatment, involving application and then drying/curing of the coating.
    -   **Name:** Coating Process

5.  **Final Visual Inspection:**
    -   **Low-level events:**
        -   Visual check
    -   **Rationale:** This is the last event in the sequence and represents a final quality check performed by an operator. It is a comprehensive assessment to ensure the product meets the final quality standards before being considered complete.
    -   **Name:** Final Visual Inspection
