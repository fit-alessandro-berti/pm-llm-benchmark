The graphic is a time-line of events that occur in the life-cycle of traffic-fine cases.

1. Horizontal axis – calendar time  
   • It begins in January 2000 (left) and ends in April 2013 (right).  
   • All vertical or slanted lines are plotted against this time axis.

2. Three categorical “bands” on the vertical axis – one for each activity in the process  
   From top to bottom the labels read:  
   • “Send Fine” (upper band)  
   • “Insert Fine Notification” (middle band – drawn as the horizontal baseline)  
   • “Send for Credit Collection” (lower band)

3. What the lines represent  
   • Every case starts at “Insert Fine Notification.”  
   • A thin grey vertical line then rises from that baseline up to the “Send Fine” band, marking when the actual fine was sent to the offender.  
   • Afterwards, a pale-pink (sometimes darker red) slanted line drops from the baseline down to the “Send for Credit Collection” band, showing when the unpaid fine was handed over to a collection agency.  
   • The slope of each pink line encodes the delay between notification and credit-collection; steeper lines mean a shorter delay, flatter lines a longer delay.

4. Visual impression  
   • The top band is extremely dense with thin grey spikes, indicating that “Send Fine” happens very frequently across the entire 13-year span.  
   • The lower band contains many triangular fans of pink lines, suggesting that large batches of fines are periodically forwarded to credit collection, often after widely varying waiting times.  
   • There are obvious clusters where pink lines are darker or more numerous, hinting at periods when many cases simultaneously reached the collection stage.

In short, the visualization is a barcode-like, many-case timeline that lets you see, for each individual fine, the dates of notification, of sending the fine, and (if necessary) of escalation to credit collection, and it reveals how those events are distributed over thirteen years.
