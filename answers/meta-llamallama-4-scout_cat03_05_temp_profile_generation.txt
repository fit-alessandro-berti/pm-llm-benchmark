## Temporal Profile for Global Supply Chain Process

The following Python dictionary represents a temporal profile for the given global supply chain process. This profile includes estimated average times and standard deviations for a subset of activity pairs. The estimation is based on general knowledge of supply chain processes and may vary depending on specific implementations.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (604800, 60480),  # Assuming 1 week average lead time with 1 day std deviation for supplier selection to order placement
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1209600, 241920),  # Approximately 2 weeks with 4 days std deviation for supplier selection to receiving components
    ('SS', 'QI'): (1296000, 259200),  # Around 2.5 weeks with 5 days std deviation for supplier selection to quality inspection
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 60480),  # 1 week average with 1 day std deviation for order placement to receiving components
    ('OP', 'CA'): (1814400, 362880),  # Approximately 3 weeks with 6 days std deviation for order placement to component assembly
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 8640),  # 1 day average with 1 hour std deviation for receiving components to quality inspection
    ('RC', 'CA'): (2592000, 518400),  # Around 6 weeks with 1 week std deviation for receiving components to component assembly
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 17280),  # 2 days average with 2 hours std deviation for quality inspection to component assembly
    ('QI', 'PT'): (345600, 34560),  # 4 days average with 4 hours std deviation for quality inspection to product testing
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 8640),  # 1 day average with 1 hour std deviation for component assembly to product testing
    ('CA', 'PK'): (604800, 60480),  # 1 week average with 1 day std deviation for component assembly to packaging
    ('PT', 'PK'): (172800, 17280),  # 2 days average with 2 hours std deviation for product testing to packaging
    ('PT', 'WS'): (259200, 25920),  # 3 days average with 3 hours std deviation for product testing to warehouse storage
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 8640),  # 1 day average with 1 hour std deviation for packaging to warehouse storage
    ('PK', 'DT'): (604800, 60480),  # 1 week average with 1 day std deviation for packaging to distribution
    ('WS', 'DT'): (604800, 60480),  # 1 week average with 1 day std deviation for warehouse storage to distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 518400),  # Approximately 6 weeks with 1 week std deviation for distribution to after-sales support
}

### Explanation

The provided dictionary captures a subset of activity pairs from the global supply chain process, including those that are directly connected and those separated by multiple steps. The estimated average times and standard deviations are based on general supply chain process knowledge, considering factors such as lead times, production complexity, and logistics.

For instance:
- The average time between `SS` (Supplier Selection) and `OP` (Order Placement) is estimated to be around 1 week with a standard deviation of 1 day, reflecting the time needed to finalize supplier selection and place an order.
- The time from `RC` (Receive Components) to `CA` (Component Assembly) includes quality inspection and procurement lead times, estimated to be around 6 weeks with a 1-week standard deviation.

### Usage

To determine if a deviation occurs for a specific activity pair, you can use the provided `ZETA` value. For example, to check for deviations with `ZETA = 2`:

```python
def check_deviation(temporal_profile, activity_pair, observed_time, ZETA=2):
    if activity_pair in temporal_profile:
        avg, stdev = temporal_profile[activity_pair]
        lower_bound = avg - ZETA * stdev
        upper_bound = avg + ZETA * stdev
        if observed_time < lower_bound or observed_time > upper_bound:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage:
activity_pair = ('SS', 'OP')
observed_time = 1209600  # 2 weeks in seconds
ZETA = 2
deviation_occurs = check_deviation(temporal_profile, activity_pair, observed_time, ZETA)
print(f"Deviation occurs: {deviation_occurs}")
```

This approach allows for monitoring and analyzing process executions against the established temporal profile, identifying potential deviations that may require attention.
