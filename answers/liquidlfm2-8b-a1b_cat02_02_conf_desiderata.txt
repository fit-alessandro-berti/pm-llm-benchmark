### 1. Violations of Normative Rules  

**Case 2 Violations:**  
- **Violation 1:** Credit Check occurred *after* Risk Assessment (instead, it must occur before).  
  - *Reason:* Sequence constraint violated: risk evaluation must follow credit check before risk assessment.  
- **Violation 2:** Finalize Documentation occurred *after* a Rejected decision.  
  - *Reason:* Closure rule violated: finalization is required only if approved; closing without finalization is forbidden.  
- **Violation 3:** Inform Applicant occurred before the loan decision (reported too early).  
  - *Reason:* Decision notification rule violated: must inform *after* loan decision, not before.  

**Summary:**  
Case 2 systematically violates multiple hard sequence and timing constraints, risking procedural integrity. These violations undermine accountability and transparency.

### 2. Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions  

**Case 2:**  
- **Timing:** Credit Check was delayed by >24 hours (from 2024-01-10 09:30 to 08:20), conflicting with best practice to complete within 24 hours.  
- **Follow-up Call:** No follow-up call made pre-closure—just a recommended best practice.  
- **Impact:** While not prohibitive, these promote responsiveness and relationship management. Skipping them represents suboptimal customer experience.

**Case 3:**  
- **Timing:** Credit Check delayed by ~4 days (from 2024-01-12 09:00 to 10:00), violating the recommended 24-hour window.  
- **Follow-up Call:** No follow-up call made—case fails to utilize an important best practice.  
- **Impact:** These deviations slightly reduce perceived care but do not breach core process integrity.

### Justifications for Observed Behaviors  

- **Case 2’s Severe Violations:**  
  The absence of careful sequencing and timing is likely attributable to operational pressure (e.g., high volume, system delays) or misprioritization. Without a quick credit check, downstream evaluations risk being incomplete or biased, increasing default risk. The lack of a follow-up suggests under-resourced client communication systems.

- **Case 3’s Desideratum Failures:**  
  The 24–48 hour desiderata are intended to maintain transparency and trust. Delays in Credit Check and omission of a follow-up reflect routine operational inefficiencies common in manual or poorly synchronized workflows—frequent in legacy systems or high-tempo environments.

### Summary Table  

| Case | Normative Violation | Desiderata Failure | Justification / Implication |  
|------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|  
| 2    | Credit Check before Risk Assessment; Documentation after Rejection; Inform before Decision | Late Credit Check (>24h); No Follow-up Call | Operational pressure or resource constraints; risks procedural rigor and client trust |  
| 3    | Late Credit Check (>24h); No Follow-up Call | Delayed Credit Check; Missing follow-up | Typical backend delays; compromises responsiveness and relationship quality |

**Recommendations:**  
- Implement automated triggers for timely Credit Checks within 24 hours.  
- Introduce mandatory follow-up calls within 48 hours of decision.  
- Monitor latency and communication gaps continuously to align process compliance with service excellence.
