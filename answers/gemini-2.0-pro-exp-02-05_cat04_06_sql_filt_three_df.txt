Okay, here is the DuckDB SQL query that fulfills the requirements.

```sql
-- Common Table Expression (CTE) to identify cases meeting the exclusion criteria
WITH CasesToExclude AS (
    -- Step 1: Use LEAD window function to look ahead at the next two events within each case
    SELECT DISTINCT
        t1.case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            -- Get the activity of the next event in the case
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
            -- Get the timestamp of the next event in the case
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
            -- Get the activity of the event after the next one
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
            -- Get the timestamp of the event after the next one
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
        FROM event_log
    ) AS t1
    WHERE
        -- Step 2: Check for the specific sequence of three activities
        t1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND t1.next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND t1.next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        -- Step 3: Check the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'
        AND (t1.next_next_timestamp - t1.next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
-- Step 4: Select all events from the original log...
SELECT
    el.case_id,
    el.activity,
    el.timestamp
    -- Add other columns from event_log if needed: , el.*
FROM
    event_log el
-- ...except for those whose case_id is in the CasesToExclude list
WHERE
    el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesToExclude)
ORDER BY
    el.case_id,
    el.timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`CasesToExclude` CTE:**
    *   It first uses a subquery (`t1`) to process the `event_log`.
    *   Inside `t1`, the `LEAD()` window function is used twice:
        *   `LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (...)` finds the activity of the immediately following event within the same `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp`.
        *   `LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (...)` finds the timestamp of that next event.
        *   `LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (...)` and `LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (...)` do the same but look two events ahead.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these results to find rows where:
        *   The current `activity` is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'.
        *   The `next_activity` is 'Create Order'.
        *   The `next_next_activity` is 'Confirm Order'.
        *   The time difference between `next_next_timestamp` (Confirm Order time) and `next_timestamp` (Create Order time) is greater than 5 days using DuckDB's interval comparison.
    *   `SELECT DISTINCT t1.case_id` collects the unique IDs of all cases that contain at least one instance of this sequence with the specified timing condition.

2.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   It selects all columns (or specific ones like `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) from the original `event_log` table (`el`).
    *   The `WHERE el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesToExclude)` clause is the crucial part: it filters out *all* events belonging to any `case_id` identified in the `CasesToExclude` CTE.
    *   `ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp` is included to present the final event log in a structured manner, though not strictly required by the prompt for the *filtering* logic itself.

This query efficiently identifies and excludes the target cases based on both the sequential pattern and the temporal condition.
