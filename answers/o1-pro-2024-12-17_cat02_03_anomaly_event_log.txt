**Overall Context:**  
A standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process generally follows a well-defined sequence:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition (PR)**: An internal request for goods or services.
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**: Internal validation and authorization of the PR.
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**: Send an authorized order to the vendor based on the approved requisition.
4. **Receive Goods**: Once the vendor delivers the goods/services, the recipient records the receipt.
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**: The invoice from the vendor is received and recorded.
6. **Match Invoice to PO**: The invoice details are checked against the PO and the goods receipt to ensure accuracy.
7. **Release Payment**: Payment is processed only after successful three-way matching (PO, goods receipt, invoice).
8. **Close Case**: The transaction is completed and recorded as closed.

The standard flow ensures appropriate authorization, proper documentation, and prevents payment before verification steps are completed. Any deviation from this sequence can create financial, compliance, and audit risks.

**Analysis by Case:**

### Case 1001
**Sequence:**  
Create PR → Approve PR → Issue PO → Receive Goods → Vendor Invoice Received → Match Invoice to PO → Release Payment → Close Case

**Comments:**  
- This sequence follows the standard order.  
- The purchase requisition is created and approved before issuing the purchase order.  
- Goods are received before the invoice is matched and payment is released.  
- The final steps adhere to the normal three-way match concept (PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice) before releasing payment.  
**Conclusion:** No apparent anomalies.

### Case 1002
**Sequence:**  
Create PR → Issue PO → Vendor Invoice Received → Release Payment → Approve PR → Receive Goods → Match Invoice to PO → Close Case

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Issue PO before Approving PR:**  
   Normally, a purchase requisition must be approved before the purchase order is generated. Issuing a PO without approval can lead to unauthorized commitments.
   
2. **Payment Released Before PR Approval and Before Receiving Goods:**  
   Payment is released immediately after receiving the invoice, but before the PR is approved and before the goods are received. This breaks a fundamental control: payment should only occur after goods have been physically verified and the invoice has been properly matched to a legally approved PO.
   
3. **Match Invoice to PO Occurs After Payment:**  
   The three-way matching process (Invoice-PO-Goods Receipt) is supposed to precede payment. Here, the invoice matching is happening after the payment is already done, which could lead to paying for incorrect or undelivered goods.

**Conclusion:**  
This sequence is highly anomalous and could result in financial and compliance risks. Unapproved expenditures, early payments, and bypassing verification steps are all problematic from a governance and control standpoint.

### Case 1003
**Sequence:**  
Create PR → Approve PR → Issue PO → **Release Payment** → Vendor Invoice Received → Receive Goods → Match Invoice to PO → Close Case

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Payment Released Before Receiving Goods and Invoice:**  
   Payment should only occur after both the receipt of goods and the invoice. Here, the payment is released even before the vendor invoice is received. This implies the company paid for something without confirming delivery or invoice accuracy.
   
2. **Matching Occurs After Payment:**  
   The invoice-to-PO match is intended to ensure the correctness of the charges and that goods were indeed received before funds are disbursed. Performing the match after payment undermines the primary control objective of the P2P process.

**Conclusion:**  
Paying in advance without confirming receipt or verifying the invoice is a significant process anomaly and increases the risk of overpayment, fraud, or non-delivery.

### Case 1004
**Sequence:**  
Create PR → Approve PR → **Receive Goods** → Issue PO → Vendor Invoice Received → Match Invoice to PO → Release Payment → Close Case

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Receiving Goods Before Issuing PO:**  
   Standard practice is to issue a PO first, which serves as the vendor’s authorization and reference document for shipment. Receiving goods before a PO is issued is unusual. It implies that goods were delivered without a formal order, potentially causing confusion in inventory control and financial tracking.
   
2. **Sequence of Controls Compromised:**  
   The PO serves as the foundation for subsequent activities (receiving goods, receiving invoices, and payment). Altering this order makes the verification steps (like matching invoice and PO) less meaningful and could encourage unauthorized or unplanned deliveries.

**Conclusion:**  
Receiving goods before a PO is unusual and risky. It can lead to compliance issues, difficulty in verifying legitimacy of delivery, and challenges in reconciling invoices and payments.

---

**Summary of Anomalies:**

- **Case 1002:** PO issued and payment released before PR approval and goods receipt. Invoice matched after payment.  
- **Case 1003:** Payment released before invoice received and goods received.  
- **Case 1004:** Goods received before issuing PO.

These anomalies break the logical order and internal controls inherent in the P2P process, potentially resulting in financial risk, operational confusion, compliance issues, and difficulty in future audits.
