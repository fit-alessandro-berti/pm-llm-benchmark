Here is the updated `declare_model` with new bias-mitigating constraints, followed by an explanation of each addition:

### Updated `declare_model`:
```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of the Added Constraints:

1. **Coexistence Constraint for Sensitive Applicant Decisions:**
   - **`"Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`** and **`"Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`**:
     - **Rationale:** Whenever a decision involves an applicant from a sensitive demographic (e.g., minority race), it is essential that a `ManualReview` step coexists to ensure fairness and oversight. This prevents potential biases from influencing these decisions without human intervention.
   
2. **Succession Constraint to Ensure Bias Mitigation Before Decision:**
   - **`"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`**:
     - **Rationale:** Before making any decisions (such as `Approve` or `Reject`), it is important to have a `BiasMitigationCheck` if sensitive attributes (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) are involved. This ensures that there is a check for fairness before decisions are influenced by potentially biased information.

3. **Non-Succession to Prevent Biased Decisions Following Sensitive Attribute Disclosure:**
   - **`"CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`**:
     - **Rationale:** This constraint ensures that a decision to `Reject` cannot immediately follow an activity like `CheckApplicantRace`. This prevents a situation where a biased decision could occur directly after considering sensitive attributes, mitigating the risk of unfair outcomes based solely on race.

### How These Constraints Mitigate Bias:
- **Coexistence constraints** ensure that sensitive decisions are reviewed before they are finalized, particularly for minority applicants. This guarantees that decisions are scrutinized and not made solely based on sensitive demographic factors.
- **Succession constraints** ensure that any decision-making (like `Approve` or `Reject`) does not occur without first checking for potential bias, especially when sensitive attributes are involved.
- **Non-succession constraints** stop sensitive attributes (like race or gender) from directly leading to biased outcomes (like rejection), requiring additional fairness checks between those steps.

These added constraints help to make the loan application process more transparent and ensure that sensitive demographic attributes do not unfairly influence decision outcomes.
