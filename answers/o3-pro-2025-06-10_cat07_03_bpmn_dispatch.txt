The picture is a BPMN 2.0 process diagram that shows how a computer-hardware shop prepares an outgoing shipment.  
What you can see, step by step, is the following.

1. Structure of the diagram  
   • One pool that represents the overall “Dispatch of goods – Computer-hardware shop”.  
   • Three horizontal lanes inside the pool:  
     – Logistics (top)  
     – Secretary (middle)  
     – Warehouse (bottom)

2. Main flow (Secretary lane)  
   a. The Start event “Ship goods” triggers the whole procedure.  
   b. A parallel gateway ( + ) splits the work: the warehouse can start packing while the secretary clarifies how the parcel must be shipped.  
   c. “Clarify shipment method” uses the attached data object “Order details”.  
   d. An exclusive gateway (X) asks “Special handling?”.  
      • Yes  The secretary requests 3 quotations from transport companies and then “Select logistic company and place order”.  
      • No   The process continues with the insurance check.  
   e. “Check if insurance is required” consults the data store “Customer information”.  
      • When insurance is necessary  The task “Insure parcel” is performed in the Logistics lane.  
   f. In every case the secretary finally executes “Write package label”.  
   g. A merging exclusive gateway (X) reunites the two secretary branches and passes control to the warehouse lane.

3. Parallel warehouse activities  
   • From the first parallel gateway the Warehouse lane received a token directly after the start event and begins “Package goods”.  
   • A boundary timer event attached to that task says: if packaging takes longer than 48 hours the alternate flow “Notify customer about delay” is triggered.  
   • When packaging is finished the token waits in front of a parallel-merge gateway ( + ) until the paperwork coming from the secretary/logistics side is also ready.

4. Completing the shipment (Warehouse lane)  
   a. After both tokens arrive, the gateway opens and the warehouse worker can  
      – “Fill out shipment paperwork”,  
      – “Move package to pickup area”.  
   b. The End event “Shipment prepared” closes the process.

5. Noteworthy modelling elements  
   • Data object  (Order details) and data store (Customer information).  
   • Two types of gateways: parallel ( + ) for concurrency, exclusive (X) for decisions.  
   • A boundary timer (48 hours) that creates an escalation path.  
   • Swim-lanes that clearly separate who does what (Secretary vs. Logistics vs. Warehouse).

In short, the visualization is a BPMN shipping-preparation workflow that illustrates decisions (special handling, insurance), optional interaction with an external logistics company, parallel work (packaging vs. administrative tasks), exception handling for delays, and the hand-off to the pick-up area once everything is complete.
