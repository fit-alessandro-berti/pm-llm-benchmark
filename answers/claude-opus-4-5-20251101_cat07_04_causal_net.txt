# Description of the Visualization

This is a **Petri Net diagram** (also known as a workflow net) representing a request handling process, along with a legend explaining the gateway notation.

## Main Process Flow

The diagram shows a business process with the following elements:

### Activities (rounded rectangles with letters):
- **a** - Register request (starting point)
- **b** - Examine thoroughly
- **c** - Examine casually
- **d** - Check ticket
- **e** - Decide
- **f** - Reinitiate request
- **g** - Pay compensation
- **h** - Reject request
- **z** - End (terminal point)

### Process Logic:
1. The process begins with **registering a request** (a)
2. After registration, there's a **parallel/choice split** leading to three examination activities (b, c, d)
3. All examination paths converge at the **decide** activity (e)
4. From the decision point, the process can:
   - **Pay compensation** (g)  End
   - **Reject request** (h)  End
   - **Reinitiate request** (f)  loops back to the examination phase

## Legend (Bottom Right)
The gray box explains six types of gateways used in Petri Nets:
- **XOR-split/join**: Exclusive choice (one path only)
- **AND-split/join**: Parallel execution (all paths)
- **OR-split/join**: Inclusive choice (one or more paths)

The black dots represent **tokens/places** that control the flow between activities.
