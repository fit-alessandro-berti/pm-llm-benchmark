The image is a **process-flow / process-mining map** that combines several business object types into one endtoend view.

- **Object types (top row)** with volumes:  
  **VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M)**, **ReturnOrderItem (0.8M)**, **PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M)**, **SalesOrderItem (3.5M)**, **PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M)**.  
  Each object type has its own **Start** node feeding into the process.

- **Activities (rectangles)** show how often they occur (e.g., “Overall: 8.5M”). Examples:
  - **Create Order (8.5M)**  **Pack Goods (2.0M)**  **Ship Goods (1.8M)**  **Confirm Delivery (1.7M)**  **Close Order (1.7M)**  **End** (a mostly linear fulfillment path on the right).
  - **Create Requisition (3.0M)**  **Approve Requisition (5.7M)** (a central hub), then branching to **Send Order (5.2M)**, **Check Stock (1.0M)**, **Approve Payment (1.5M)**, **Create Invoice (2.0M)**, and **Process Return (0.8M)**.

- **Connections (arrows)** are **color-coded by object type** and annotated with **timings in milliseconds** (e.g., 300ms, 400ms, 650ms), indicating typical time between steps.

- **Colored dots inside activity boxes** indicate which object types participate in that activity (some steps involve multiple objects, like the central “Approve Requisition” and “Create Order”).
