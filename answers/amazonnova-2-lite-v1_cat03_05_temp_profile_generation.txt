### Temporal Profile for Global Supply Chain Process

Below is a Python dictionary representing the **temporal profile** for the global supply chain process involving high-tech electronics manufacturing. The dictionary maps pairs of activities — where one activity eventually follows another in at least one process execution — to their estimated `(average_time, standard_deviation)` in seconds.

The temporal distances reflect realistic delays between activities, accounting for factors such as supplier lead times, inspection bottlenecks, assembly complexity, testing rigor, packaging efficiency, warehouse handling, and distribution logistics.

### **Explanation of Estimated Times**

- **Times are in seconds.**
- **Average times** reflect typical durations based on real-world supply chain operations:
  - **Supplier selection** to **order placement**: a couple of days for internal approvals and negotiations.
  - **Order placement** to **component receipt**: typically a week or more, depending on geographical distance and shipping method.
  - **Quality inspection**: a few shifts, depending on component complexity.
  - **Assembly and testing**: can take a day or more due to precision requirements.
  - **Packaging and warehousing**: relatively fast, often within hours.
  - **Distribution**: often takes a day or two, depending on region.
  - **After-sales support**: occurs much later, modeled as weeks to months after delivery.

- **Standard deviations** reflect variability:
  - High variability in **supplier lead times**, **inspection outcomes**, and **distribution logistics**.
  - Lower variability in **assembly**, **testing**, and **packaging**, which are more controlled internally.

This temporal profile can be used to detect **anomalous delays** in the supply chain by comparing observed inter-activity times against the `(AVG ± ZETA * STDEV)` thresholds.
