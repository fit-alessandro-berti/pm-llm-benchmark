It’s a BPMN process map of an order-to-cash workflow with four swimlanes: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

- Trigger: a timer event in Sales (“Monday morning”).
- Sales:
  - Expanded subprocess “Check customer’s order”: check order completeness, verify whether the customer exists, add the customer to a database if needed.
  - Send order details to other departments.
  - After receiving the “Product sent” message from Warehouse, draft the invoice and end.
- Production:
  - Message start (“Order details arrive”).
  - Plan production, then wait for a confirmation that materials are OK.
  - Once confirmed, manufacture the product and notify Warehouse (“Product complete”).
- Procurement:
  - Message start (“Order details arrive”).
  - Run a “Material Compensation Subprocess” (order materials; return faulty material if needed).
  - Check materials; if acceptable, send “Material not faulty” to Production. If not, issue “Order cancellation” and end.
- Warehouse:
  - After the “Product complete” message from Production, send the product and notify Sales (“Product sent”).

Solid arrows show the internal sequence in each lane; dashed lines are inter-department message flows. The process either ends with shipment and invoicing or with an order cancellation from Procurement.
