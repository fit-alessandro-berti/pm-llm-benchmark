Based on the provided data, there are several notable differences that can be observed through a lens of clinical and operational understanding:

1. **Frequency of Occurrence:**
   - The most frequent sequence is "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" (frequency = 653), indicating that this pathway is the most common for patients who receive expert examination.
   
2. **Performance Metrics (Presumably Patient Satisfaction or Efficiency):**
   - Generally, sequences involving "Expert Examination" tend to have lower performance scores compared to those with only an "Examination". For example, "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a score of 260001.864, whereas "Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" scores much lower (320005.695).
   - This could suggest that while expert examinations might be necessary for complex cases, they may add more time and resources to the patient's care pathway, affecting overall efficiency or patient satisfaction.

3. **Involvement of Thorough Examination:**
   - Sequences involving "Thorough Examination" (e.g., “Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge”) tend to be less frequent but also score higher in performance (480007.142 vs. 260001.864). This may indicate that thorough examinations are reserved for more critical or complex cases, thus requiring additional time and expertise.

4. **Outcome of Treatment:**
   - Sequences with "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful" have lower frequency but higher performance scores when they finally resolve successfully (e.g., 639982.275 for multiple iterations leading to a successful outcome). This suggests that while these cases might be more challenging, the final resolution is valued positively despite initial setbacks.

In summary:
- **Expert Examinations** are often used and can affect overall performance negatively but may indicate complex or critical patient conditions.
- **Thorough Examinations** are less frequent yet tend to have higher performance scores due to their necessity in specific cases.
- Cases that require multiple diagnoses and treatments ("Treatment unsuccessful") leading to a successful outcome, though challenging, ultimately result in high satisfaction when resolved successfully.

Understanding these patterns can help healthcare facilities optimize resource allocation, streamline patient pathways, and potentially improve overall patient satisfaction by addressing bottlenecks associated with expert or thorough examinations.
