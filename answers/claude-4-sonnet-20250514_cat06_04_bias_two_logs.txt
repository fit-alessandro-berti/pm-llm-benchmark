Looking at these two event logs, **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits clear bias** that systematically advantages local residents and community group members.

## How the Bias Manifests:

### 1. **Score Adjustment Advantage**
- **Group B** receives a "+10 (Community Boost)" for applicants who belong to community groups (Highland Civic Darts Club)
- **Group A** receives no such adjustments - all ScoreAdjustments are 0
- This creates an artificial 10-point advantage for certain applicants in Group B

### 2. **Systematic Pattern of Advantage**
The bias creates a clear pattern:

**Group B Examples:**
- U001: 720  730 (with boost)  **Approved**
- U003: 695  705 (with boost)  **Approved** 
- U002: 710  710 (no group membership)  **Rejected**

**Group A for comparison:**
- P002: 710  710  **Rejected** (same score as U002, same outcome)
- But U003 with a lower original score (695) gets approved due to the boost

### 3. **Protected Characteristics Impact**
The bias is tied to:
- **LocalResident status**: All Group B members are local residents (TRUE)
- **CommunityGroup membership**: Members of "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive preferential treatment

## Why This Constitutes Bias:

1. **Arbitrary Advantage**: The +10 community boost creates unequal treatment based on social connections rather than creditworthiness

2. **Threshold Manipulation**: U003 demonstrates how someone with a 695 score (below the apparent 710 threshold) can leapfrog over equally or more qualified non-members

3. **Systematic Discrimination**: Group A applicants have no opportunity to receive these adjustments, creating inherent inequality in the process

4. **Opaque Criteria**: Community group membership appears to be an unofficial selection criterion that advantages insiders

**Group A shows the unbiased process** - consistent scoring without preferential adjustments, where decisions are based purely on creditworthiness. **Group B shows algorithmic bias** that systematically favors local community members, potentially discriminating against outsiders regardless of their actual qualifications.
