The image is a workflow/process-flow diagram (Petri-net–like notation) for handling a request.

- **Activities** are shown as rounded rectangles labeled with letters:
  - **a** “register request” (start of the process)
  - **b** “examine thoroughly”
  - **c** “examine casually”
  - **d** “check ticket”
  - **e** “decide”
  - **f** “reinitiate request” (part of a loop back to earlier steps)
  - **g** “pay compensation”
  - **h** “reject request”
  - **z** “end” (process completion)

- **Arrows** show the possible execution paths:
  - From **a**, the flow branches into the examination/checking steps (**b/c/d**).
  - These paths **merge into e (decide)**.
  - From **e**, the process branches to either **g (pay compensation)** or **h (reject request)**, and both lead to **z (end)**.
  - There is also a **loop involving f (reinitiate request)** that routes the process back toward earlier evaluation steps.

- The **black filled circles** act as routing/connector points, and the **inset legend** (bottom-right) explains the connector patterns used to represent **XOR-, AND-, and OR- splits and joins**.
