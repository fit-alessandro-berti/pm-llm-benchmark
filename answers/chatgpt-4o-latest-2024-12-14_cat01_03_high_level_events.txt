### High-Level Process Steps and Grouping Rationale

#### 1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Included Events:**
     - `Retrieve raw metal sheet`
     - `Scan barcode`
     - `Place metal sheet on table`
     - `Align metal sheet`
     - `Preheat metal sheet`
   - **Rationale:**
     - These events focus on getting the raw material ready for processing. They are logically sequential, performed by the same or closely related resources (e.g., Operator A and Robot Arm #2), and occur within a short time frame. The activities are all preparatory actions required before the assembly stage.
   - **Name:** Material Preparation

---

#### 2. **Assembly**
   - **Included Events:**
     - `Pick up welding tool`
     - `Weld corner A`
     - `Weld corner B`
   - **Rationale:**
     - These events represent the core assembly process where components are joined together. The grouping is defined by the use of the welding tool and the welding operations, which are consecutive and performed by the same resource (Operator B).
   - **Name:** Assembly

---

#### 3. **Quality Assurance (QA) - Weld Integrity Check**
   - **Included Events:**
     - `Measure weld integrity`
   - **Rationale:**
     - This event is distinct as it focuses on verifying the quality of the assembly step. It is performed by a specialized resource (Quality Sensor #1) and is critical for transitioning to the next stage.
   - **Name:** Weld Integrity Check

---

#### 4. **Coating Application**
   - **Included Events:**
     - `Apply protective coating`
     - `Dry coating`
   - **Rationale:**
     - These events involve applying a protective layer and ensuring it is properly set. The activities are sequential and belong to the same functional step of enhancing the durability of the product.
   - **Name:** Coating Application

---

#### 5. **Final Quality Inspection**
   - **Included Events:**
     - `Visual check`
   - **Rationale:**
     - This step ensures the final product meets visual and general quality standards. It is distinct in purpose and performed by a human operator, providing the final approval before the product moves forward.
   - **Name:** Final Quality Inspection

| **Assembly**               | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B                                                            | Join components to form the product.                                                                 |
| **Weld Integrity Check**   | Measure weld integrity                                                                                        | Verify the strength and quality of the welds.                                                        |
| **Coating Application**    | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                                                                         | Add and solidify protective coatings to ensure durability.                                            |
| **Final Quality Inspection** | Visual check                                                                                                 | Perform a visual check to ensure compliance with quality standards.                                   |

### Notes on Grouping Logic
1. **Temporal Clustering:** Events were grouped based on their proximity in time, ensuring that steps like preheating and welding, which occur in quick succession, remain part of a coherent process stage.
2. **Resource Utilization:** Events performed by the same or related resources (e.g., Operator A handling material preparation) were grouped together to reflect their shared purpose.
3. **Functional Purpose:** Each high-level activity aligns with a distinct phase in the manufacturing process, ensuring that the workflow is logical and intuitive.

This structured representation simplifies analysis and monitoring of the manufacturing process, highlighting key stages and ensuring clarity in operational oversight.
