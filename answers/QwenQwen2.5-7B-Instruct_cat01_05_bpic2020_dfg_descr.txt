This data describes a multi-stage approval process for declarations that potentially leads to a payment. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Declaration Submission:**
   - The process starts with an employee submitting a declaration.
   - This triggers several possible paths:
     - It can be APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION (which then signals a path to FINAL_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR).
     - It can be APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER (which also leads to FINAL_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR).
     - It can be REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION or REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, leading back to resubmission or other actions.
     - It can be REJECTED by EMPLOYEE initially, which can be considered a no-change action as it cycles back to SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE.

2. **Approval Stages:**
   - After initial APPROVAL in the previous step, the declaration can proceed to:
     - APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, which then goes to FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR.
     - APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER, which then goes to FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR.
     - If already FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, this is the end of the approval path, with steps including Request Payment and Payment Handling (which requires a payment frequency of 10038 and a performance metric of 273266.628, indicating a high volume of payments handled post-final approval).

3. **Rejection Stages:**
   - Rejections occur at various points:
     - Initial rejection by EMPLOYEE (can cycle back to submission).
     - In the administrative approval stage by ADMINISTRATION (REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION leads to REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, essentially looping back).
     - In the PRE_APPROVER stage (REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER also loops back to EMPLOYEE).
     - At the SUPERVISOR level (initial REJECTED by SUPERVISOR leads back to EMPLOYEE, while subsequent rejection leads the process to loop through if no action is taken further).

4. **Miscellaneous Paths:**
   - There are also some less common paths:
     - Final APPROVED by SUPERVISOR can result in an initial REJECTION by MISSING, or directly lead to Payment Handling.
     - Payment Handling can be REJECTED by MISSING, suggesting that post-payment handling stages may also contain rejections and resubmissions.

5. **Special Cases:**
   - There are specific cases that involve intensive performance metrics:
     - The path from Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE to Request Payment has a particularly high performance metric (1471681.000), suggesting a potential exception handling or appeals process.
     - Similarly, the rejections from SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, and BUDGET OWNER have high performance metrics, indicating a significant amount of time spent on these rejections.

The overall process suggests a structured but flexible multi-stage approval system for declarations, with possible pathways and rejections that can loop back to earlier stages, and a final payment step that can be further re-evaluated or rejected after payment is made. The high performance metrics indicate significant labor or time investment in resolving rejections and processing payments.
