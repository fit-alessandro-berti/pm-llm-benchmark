Certainly! Let’s go through your requests step by step based on the event log and provided constraints.

### **1. Normative Rule Violations (Hard Violations)**

Let’s review each case and assess compliance with strict **normative sequence and rules**:

---

####  **Case 1 – Fully Compliant**
- **Sequence followed correctly:**
    - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **No steps were skipped or done out of order.**
- **Approved case included Finalize Documentation before Close Case.**

 **Conclusion**: **No normative violations in Case 1.**

---

####  **Case 2 – Normative Violations Present**

**Violations Identified:**

- **Violation 1:**  
  - **Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check**  
    - This violates the enforced order:
      - **Required**: Credit Check  Risk Assessment  
      - **Observed**: Risk Assessment (08:20)  Credit Check (09:00)  
    -  **Normative Violation: Order Broken**

- **Violation 2:**  
  - **Finalize Documentation occurs even though the loan was rejected**  
    - Loan Decision: Rejected (09:30)  
    - Finalize Documentation: 10:00  Not allowed after rejection

- **Violation 3 (Implied):**
  - Even if the order were correct, **Finalize Documentation should not happen at all with a rejected outcome**, regardless of timing.

 **Conclusion**: **Case 2 Violates multiple normative rules:**
- Incorrect order of Risk Assessment before Credit Check
- Finalize Documentation performed after a Rejection

---

####  **Case 3 – Normatively Compliant**

- **Order followed correctly**:
    - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **Finalize Documentation correctly follows an approval**
- **No ordering violations**

 **Conclusion**: **No hard rules violated in Case 3**

###  **Normative Violation Summary:**

| Case ID | Normative Rule Violations                             | Explanation                                                            |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       |  None                                                 | All steps followed correctly                                           |
| 2       |  Yes                                                  | (1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check, (2) Finalizing after rejection |
| 3       |  None                                                 | Timing not ideal, but order intact and valid                           |

### **2. Desiderata Deviations (Best Practice Shortcomings)**

These are not **rule violations**, but reflect **non-optimal behavior** based on recommendations.

---

####  **Case 1 – Best Practice Compliant**

- **Credit Check:** Done within 30 minutes of receiving application  
- **Inform Applicant:** Within 2 hours of decision  
- **Follow-up Call:** Not present, but it’s optional  
 **Conclusion**: Compliant with all desiderata.

---

####  **Case 2 – Minor Desiderata Violations**

- **No Follow-up Call**: Missing, but optional

*However, since the case was **rejected**, follow-up call may be less relevant or intentionally omitted.*  
 Acceptable if intentional

 **Conclusion**: Minor non-critical issue (no Follow-up Call), but **not a violation**.

---

####  **Case 3 – Multiple Best Practice Shortcomings**

- **Credit Check Delay**:  
  - Application Received: Jan 12, 09:00  
  - Credit Check: Jan 14, 10:00  ~**49 hours after application**  **Misses 24hr goal**

- **Inform Applicant Delay**:  
  - Loan Decision: Jan 14, 12:00  
  - Inform Applicant: Jan 16, 15:00  **51 hours later**  **Misses 48hr recommendation**

- **No Follow-up Call recorded**  
  - Omitted, but optional

 **Conclusion**: All issues are best-practice level (non-severe), but indicate **sluggish processing** and **communication gap**

###  **Desiderata Summary:**

| Case ID | Desiderata Deviations                                                                                      |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       |  None                                                                                                     |
| 2       |  No Follow-up Call (non-critical, especially considering rejection)                                      |
| 3       |  Credit Check delayed >24h, Inform Applicant delayed >48h, No Follow-up Call                             |

### **3. Interpretations & Justifications**

While some deviations might appear problematic, there may be reasonable justifications within operational realities:

#### **Case 1:**
-  Ideal case. Optionally exemplary for automation benchmarking and compliance metrics.

#### **Case 2:**
-  Clear coordination failure.
  - Risk Evaluation conducted prematurely (*possibly parallel processing error or lack of dependency enforcement*)
  - Documentation finalization after rejection may reflect a **process misunderstanding or system bug**
-  **Recommendation**: Build fail-safe checks to prevent scheduling of "Finalize Documentation" for rejected loans.

#### **Case 3:**
-  Delays in processing may reflect:
  - **Staff shortage over weekend**, since there’s a 2-day gap between Application and Credit Check  
  - **Late communication** might reflect internal backlog or manual steps
  - **Follow-up Call omitted** — if time-constrained, may have been skipped due to low perceived risk in approved case

-  Interpretation: Though not critical, these delays **can impact customer satisfaction and efficiency goals**
