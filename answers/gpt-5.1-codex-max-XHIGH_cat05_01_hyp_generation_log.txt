You are analyzing an order-to-cash process event log. Use the schema and sample data below to identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors, hypothesize plausible causes (e.g., policy violations, system misconfigurations, training gaps), and propose relevant SQL queries to investigate those hypotheses further.

**Database:** PostgreSQL

**Tables and Columns:**

- `order_event_log`
  - `case_id` (INTEGER) – Order identifier
  - `event_id` (INTEGER) – Primary key
  - `activity` (VARCHAR) – Event/activity name
  - `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP) – Event time
  - `resource` (VARCHAR) – Person/system performing the activity
  - `additional_info` (VARCHAR) – Context (e.g., amounts, reason codes)
- `orders`
  - `case_id` (INTEGER) – Matches `order_event_log.case_id`
  - `customer_id` (INTEGER) – Customer identifier
  - `order_type` (VARCHAR) – E.g., standard, priority
  - `order_value` (DECIMAL) – Monetary value
- `resources`
  - `resource_id` (VARCHAR) – Matches `order_event_log.resource`
  - `role` (VARCHAR) – Role (e.g., SalesRep, CreditOfficer)
  - `department` (VARCHAR) – Department (e.g., Sales, Finance)

**Assumed normal process flow:**
1) Register Order (Sales)
2) Perform Credit Check (Finance)
3) Validate Stock (Warehouse)
4) Confirm Shipment (Logistics)
5) Ship Goods (Logistics)
6) Issue Invoice (Finance)
7) Receive Payment (Finance)

Your task:
- Spot deviations, control violations, and unusual sequences or timings relative to the normal flow.
- Suggest plausible causes for these anomalies.
- Propose specific SQL queries (against `order_event_log`, optionally joining `orders` and `resources`) to validate and explore these hypotheses.
