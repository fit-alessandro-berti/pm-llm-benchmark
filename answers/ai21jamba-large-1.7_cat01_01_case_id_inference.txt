Here's the structured explanation for how to infer case IDs for the events:

### **Step 1: Identify cases by key pattern matching**

- **Activity Sequence:** A typical case follows a pattern like `Register patient  Initial triage  Doctor consultation  Diagnosis or Treatment  Discharge`.
- **Attributes Consistency:** Events within a case must match on `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and their logical progress through different departments.

### **Step 2: Group the Events**

#### Case 1: Male patient, 45 years old

- Timestamp progression aligns, and all activities correspond to a single gender and age.
	- **Events:**
		1. `Register patient - M, 45`
		2. `Initial triage - M, 45` (Nurse Joy)
		3. `X-ray imaging - M, 45`
		4. `Doctor consultation - M, 45` (Dr. Smith, diagnosis: hairline_fracture)
		5. `Patient discharged - M, 45` (follow-up: outpatient clinic)

#### Case 2: Female patient, 62 years old

- Events contain matching attributes and a complete patient journey.
	- **Events:**
		1. `Register patient - F, 62`
		2. `Initial triage - F, 62` (Nurse Mark, triage_code: 2)
		3. `Lab test requested - F, 62` (blood panel, normal results)
		4. `Doctor consultation - F, 62` (Dr. Smith, diagnosis: minor infection)
		5. `Prescription created - F, 62` (antibiotics)
		6. `Patient discharged - F, 62` (follow-up: pharmacy pickup)

#### Case 3: Male patient, 28 years old

- Events related to surgery with a clear sequence.
	- **Events:**
		1. `Register patient - M, 28`
		2. `Doctor consultation - M, 28` (scheduled knee surgery)
		3. `Surgery preparation - M, 28`
		4. `Surgery performed - M, 28` (procedure: arthroscopy)
		5. `Recovery room - M, 28`
		6. `Patient discharged - M, 28` (follow-up: physiotherapy)

### **Step 3: Finalized Groupings and Case IDs**

Here’s the group assignment for each event:

1. **Case 1 (M, 45):** Events 1, 4, 5, 7, 13
2. **Case 2 (F, 62):** Events 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15
3. **Case 3 (M, 28):** Events 3, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18

This grouping is logical, respects activity timelines, and ensures consistency in patient demographics and activities.
