### Identified Anomalies and Hypotheses

#### **1. Out-of-Sequence Process Steps**
- **Example**: 
  - Case 1002: "Confirm Shipment" and "Ship Goods" occur before "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock".
  - Case 1003: "Ship Goods" occurs before "Validate Stock" and "Confirm Shipment".
- **Hypothesis**: 
  - Priority orders (like case 1002) might bypass checks due to manual overrides or system misconfiguration.
  - Training gaps: Resources may not follow the standard workflow.

#### **2. Missing Mandatory Activities**
- **Example**: 
  - Case 1003: No "Validate Stock" event.
  - Case 1004: Missing "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock".
- **Hypothesis**: 
  - System may allow skipping steps for high-value orders (case 1004: $3000) or specific customers.
  - Policy violation: Resources may manually skip steps to expedite orders.

#### **3. Payment Before Invoice**
- **Example**: 
  - Case 1004: "Receive Payment" occurs before "Issue Invoice".
- **Hypothesis**: 
  - Prepayment scenarios not properly logged (e.g., payment received externally before invoicing).
  - Data entry error: Events logged in incorrect order.

#### **4. Unusually Short Process Durations**
- **Example**: 
  - Case 1002: Only 5 minutes between "Register Order" and "Confirm Shipment".
  - Case 1004: Payment received 5 minutes after order registration.
- **Hypothesis**: 
  - Testing or dummy orders with fabricated timestamps.
  - System auto-advancing stages without human input.

### SQL Queries to Investigate Anomalies

#### **1. Identify Out-of-Sequence Workflows**
```sql
WITH event_sequence AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT
  case_id,
  activity,
  prev_activity,
  timestamp
FROM event_sequence
WHERE 
  (prev_activity = 'Register Order' AND activity NOT IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock')) OR
  (prev_activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND activity != 'Validate Stock') OR
  (prev_activity = 'Validate Stock' AND activity != 'Confirm Shipment');
```

#### **2. Detect Missing Mandatory Steps**
```sql
SELECT
  o.case_id,
  o.order_type,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 END) = 0 AS missing_credit_check,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 END) = 0 AS missing_stock_check
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_event_log log ON o.case_id = log.case_id
GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_type
HAVING 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 END) = 0 OR
  COUNT(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 END) = 0;
```

#### **3. Validate Payment-Before-Invoice Scenarios**
```sql
SELECT
  pay.case_id,
  pay.timestamp AS payment_time,
  inv.timestamp AS invoice_time
FROM 
  (SELECT case_id, timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment') pay
JOIN
  (SELECT case_id, timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Issue Invoice') inv
ON pay.case_id = inv.case_id
WHERE pay.timestamp < inv.timestamp;
```

#### **4. Investigate Rapid Process Execution**
```sql
WITH first_last_events AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    MIN(timestamp) AS first_event,
    MAX(timestamp) AS last_event
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT
  fle.case_id,
  o.order_type,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (last_event - first_event)) / 3600 AS total_hours
FROM first_last_events fle
JOIN orders o ON fle.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (last_event - first_event)) / 3600 < 1; -- Less than 1 hour total
```

#### **5. Resource Role Violations**
```sql
SELECT
  log.resource,
  r.role,
  log.activity,
  COUNT(DISTINCT log.case_id) AS cases_handled
FROM order_event_log log
JOIN resources r ON log.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE 
  (log.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND r.department != 'Finance') OR
  (log.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND r.department != 'Logistics')
GROUP BY log.resource, r.role, log.activity;
```

#### **6. High-Value Order Exceptions**
```sql
SELECT
  o.case_id,
  o.order_value,
  STRING_AGG(log.activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY log.timestamp) AS process_flow
FROM orders o
JOIN order_event_log log ON o.case_id = log.case_id
WHERE o.order_value > 2000
GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_value
HAVING 
  NOT STRING_AGG(log.activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY log.timestamp) LIKE '%Perform Credit Check%Validate Stock%';
```

### Suggested Next Steps
1. Cross-reference results with `additional_info` for root-cause clues (e.g., `attempted_early=Y`).
2. Compare anomaly rates between order types using `orders.order_type`.
3. Audit timestamps for cases with sub-1-hour total duration to detect test data.
4. Investigate resources with role/department mismatches for training needs.
