To solve this problem, we need to follow a structured approach to extract the sequences of activities for each `case_id`, identify unique process variants, determine the top K variants by frequency, and finally retrieve all events associated with these top K variants.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Extract Activity Sequences:**
   - For each `case_id`, order the activities by `timestamp` and concatenate them into a single string to represent the sequence.
   - Use `STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp)` to create the sequence.

2. **Count Frequency of Each Variant:**
   - Group the sequences and count how many cases have each sequence.
   - Use `COUNT(*)` grouped by the sequence.

3. **Determine Top K Variants:**
   - Order the variants by their frequency in descending order.
   - Select the top K sequences using `LIMIT K`.

4. **Retrieve Events for Top K Variants:**
   - Join the original event log with the top K case_ids to get all events belonging to these cases.

### SQL Query:

```sql
WITH activity_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM
        activity_sequences
    GROUP BY
        activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM
        variant_frequencies
    ORDER BY
        frequency DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
JOIN
    activity_sequences asq ON el.case_id = asq.case_id
JOIN
    top_k_variants tkv ON asq.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence;
```

### Notes:

- **Replace `K` with the desired number of top variants.**
- **Ensure that the timestamp is properly handled for ordering.**
- **The use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) improves readability and structure.**
- **This query assumes that `timestamp` is of a type that can be ordered directly.**
