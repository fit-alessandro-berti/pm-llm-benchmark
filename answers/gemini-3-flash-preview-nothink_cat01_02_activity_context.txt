This analysis focuses on disambiguating activity names within the provided event log. In complex workflows, the same action (e.g., "Verify Documents") often serves different purposes depending on whether it is the first attempt, a follow-up after an error, or a final check.

### 1. Identification of Recurring Activities and Contextual Shifts

Based on the log, three activities require disambiguation:

*   **Initiate Request:** While it always starts the process, the entry point (Online vs. Walk-in) changes the resource requirements and the initial data quality.
*   **Verify Documents:** This appears as both an initial screening and a secondary re-verification after corrections or additional submissions have been made.
*   **Call Customer:** This is the most context-heavy activity. Its meaning shifts from "Requesting missing information" to "Clarifying errors," "Confirming completion," or "Logistical coordination" (returning to the branch).

### 2. Renaming Strategy

The activities have been renamed to include their specific purpose (e.g., "Initial" vs. "Supplemental") or the specific intent of the communication.

### 4. Justification for Naming Changes

*   **Initiation (Online vs. Walk-in):** In financial services, the risk profile and processing time for a "WebPortal" request differ significantly from a face-to-face "Walk-in." Differentiating these allows the company to measure the efficiency of digital vs. physical channels separately.
*   **Verification (Initial vs. Supplemental/Post-Adjustment):** Labeling the first check as "Initial" and subsequent checks as "Re-check" or "Post-Adjustment" helps identify "rework" loops. If a case has multiple "Re-checks," it indicates a failure in the initial data collection phase.
*   **Call Customer (Specific Intent):**
    *   **Request Missing Docs:** This is a bottleneck-clearing activity.
    *   **Clarify Discrepancy:** This is an investigation activity.
    *   **Confirm Resolution:** This is a customer satisfaction/closing activity.
    *   **Request Return to Branch:** This is a logistical/physical workflow activity.
    *   *Justification:* By separating these, management can see why agents are spending time on the phone. "Confirm Resolution" is high-value service, whereas "Request Missing Docs" is avoidable overhead.
*   **Approval:** Renamed to "Grant Final Approval" to emphasize that this is the concluding gatekeeping step of the entire workflow.
