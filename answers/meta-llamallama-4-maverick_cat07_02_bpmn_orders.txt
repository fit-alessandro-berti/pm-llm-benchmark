The image is a flowchart that illustrates the process of handling customer orders, from sales to production and shipping. The chart is divided into four main sections: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

**Sales Section**

*   The process starts with "Monday morning" and involves checking the customer's order for completeness.
*   If the customer is not in the database, they are added to it.
*   The order details are then sent to the production department.
*   A draft invoice is created.

**Production Section**

*   Upon receiving the order details, the production department plans production.
*   If the material is not faulty, the product is manufactured.
*   Once the product is complete, it is sent to the warehouse.

**Procurement Section**

*   The procurement department receives the order details and orders materials.
*   The materials are then checked for quality.
*   If the materials are faulty, they are returned.

**Warehouse Section**

*   The warehouse receives the product from production and sends it to the customer.
