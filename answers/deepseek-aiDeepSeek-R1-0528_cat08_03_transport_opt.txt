We are given a scenario where Speedy Parcels, a logistics company, is facing issues with late deliveries and high operational costs. They have collected event data from multiple sources. As a Process Mining Consultant, we need to outline a comprehensive approach to analyze their operations and recommend improvements.

Let's break down the task into the five points:

1. **Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**
2. **Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**
3. **Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**
4. **Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**
5. **Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

We'll address each in detail.

### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

**Data Preprocessing and Integration:**
- **Integration:** We need to combine data from GPS, scanner, dispatch, and maintenance logs into a single event log. The key is to have a common case identifier (e.g., Vehicle-Day as in the example: `V12-20241205`). Each event should have at least: case ID, activity name, timestamp, and any relevant attributes (e.g., vehicle ID, driver ID, package ID, location, speed, etc.).
- **Challenges:**
  - **Data Alignment:** Events from different sources may have different timestamps and may not align perfectly. We need to synchronize clocks use interpolation use interpolation if necessary.
  - **Event Correlation:** Linking package-specific events (from scanners) to the vehicle-day case. Also, maintenance events might span multiple days and need to be linked appropriately.
  - **Data Quality:** Missing events (e.g., a scanner event might be missing), duplicate events, or incorrect data (e.g., GPS drift). We may need to clean the data by filtering outliers, imputing missing events (if possible), or using heuristics to infer events (e.g., if a vehicle is at a customer location and then moves, we can infer a departure even if not scanned).
  - **Event Abstraction:** Raw GPS data might not directly correspond to business activities. We may need to abstract low-level GPS events (like "low speed detected") into higher-level activities (e.g., "In Traffic Jam", "At Customer Location"). This can be done using rules (e.g., if speed is 0 for more than 5 minutes at a non-depot location, then it's an "Unplanned Stop").

**Process Discovery:**
- Use process discovery algorithms (like Inductive Miner, Heuristics Miner, or Fuzzy Miner) to create a process model that shows the actual flow of activities. The model should include:
  - Key activities: Depart Depot, Arrive Customer, Delivery Success/Fail, Depart Customer, Arrive Depot, and also events like "Traffic Delay", "Vehicle Breakdown", "Maintenance Stop".
  - The discovered model will show the sequence of activities, parallel paths, loops (e.g., for multiple delivery attempts), and deviations (e.g., unscheduled maintenance).
- We can also discover multiple models for different contexts (e.g., by route, by driver, by vehicle type) to see variations.

**Conformance Checking:**
- Compare the actual event log against the planned process model (from the dispatch system). The planned model would be the sequence of stops as assigned, with expected travel times and service times.
- Techniques: Use token-based replay or alignment-based conformance checking to measure deviations.
- Types of deviations to look for:
  - **Sequence Deviations:** E.g., visiting stops in a different order than planned, skipping a stop, adding an unplanned stop (like a maintenance stop).
  - **Timing Deviations:** Significant differences in the time taken for travel between stops or service time at a stop. For example, a planned 10-minute travel between stop 1 and 2 actually took 30 minutes.
  - **Unplanned Events:** Occurrence of events not in the plan, such as "Unscheduled Stop" for maintenance or "Traffic Jam".
  - **Resource Deviations:** Using a different vehicle or driver than planned.

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of packages delivered within the customer-requested time window. Calculated by comparing the timestamp of "Delivery Success" with the customer time window (from dispatch data).
- **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Total time from "Arrive Customer" to "Depart Customer" for successful deliveries, averaged over stops. Exclude failed attempts.
- **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Total time spent moving (from GPS: when speed > 0) vs. time spent at stops (from scanner: from "Arrive Customer" to "Depart Customer").
- **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Fuel consumption can be estimated from vehicle type and distance traveled (from GPS) and then divided by total km or by number of packages delivered. Alternatively, if fuel data is available, use that.
- **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Time the vehicle is actively used (from "Depart Depot" to "Arrive Depot") divided by total shift time (from "Start Shift" to "End Shift").
- **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:** Count of "Low Speed Detected" events (or inferred traffic delays) and their average duration.
- **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Number of "Delivery Failed" events divided by total delivery attempts.

**Bottleneck Identification:**
- Use performance spectrum or bottleneck analysis techniques in process mining to identify stages in the process that cause delays.
- Techniques:
  - **Waiting Time Analysis:** Identify where cases spend the most time waiting (e.g., in traffic, at a customer location).
  - **Resource Utilization:** Check if certain resources (vehicles, drivers) are overburdened.
  - **Variant Analysis:** Group cases by performance (e.g., on-time vs. late) and compare the process flows to see which paths lead to delays.
- Bottlenecks might be:
  - **Geographical:** Specific areas (traffic hotspots) where travel time is consistently high.
  - **Temporal:** Certain times of day (e.g., rush hour) with high delays.
  - **Resource-based:** Specific drivers with long service times, or vehicles with frequent breakdowns.
  - **Activity-based:** Long dwell times at customer locations (e.g., finding parking, waiting for customer).
- Quantify impact by calculating the additional time spent due to the bottleneck and the effect on overall delivery time and cost.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

Potential root causes and how process mining can help:

- **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Compare planned vs. actual routes. If drivers frequently deviate from the plan (due to traffic or other reasons) and the deviations lead to better performance, then static routes may be suboptimal. Use conformance checking and variant analysis to see if alternative routes (taken by drivers) are faster.

- **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:** Compare planned travel times (from dispatch) with actual travel times (from GPS). Use regression analysis (outside process mining) or process mining with performance data to see the variance and its causes (e.g., time of day, weather if available).

- **Traffic Congestion:** Correlate GPS data (speed, location) with external traffic data or internal events (like "Low Speed Detected"). Use process mining to see the impact on overall delivery time and if certain routes are more affected.

- **High Variability in Service Time:** Analyze the time spent at customer locations (from "Arrive Customer" to "Depart Customer"). Check for patterns: are certain drivers slower? Are certain locations (e.g., apartment buildings) taking longer? Use clustering in process mining to group similar stops and compare.

- **Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance:** Analyze the frequency and duration of maintenance events during shifts. Check if these events lead to delays and if they are predictable (e.g., after a certain mileage). Use process mining to see the impact on the rest of the route.

- **Driver Behavior:** Compare drivers using performance KPIs (e.g., average service time, adherence to route). Use variant analysis to see if different drivers follow different processes (e.g., one driver might always park illegally leading to fines, while another spends time looking for parking).

- **Failed Deliveries:** Analyze the reasons for failure (from notes) and the impact (re-delivery costs). Check if failed deliveries are clustered in certain areas or times. Also, check if the time window was too narrow or if the customer was not notified properly.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Propose three distinct strategies:

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** Long travel times due to traffic and suboptimal static routes.
- **Root Cause:** Static routing cannot adapt to real-time conditions (traffic, weather).
- **Process Mining Support:** Analysis shows high deviations from planned routes and high travel time variability. Also, bottlenecks at traffic hotspots.
- **Proposal:** Implement a dynamic routing system that uses real-time traffic data and historical process mining insights (e.g., typical travel times at different hours) to suggest optimal routes during the shift.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduce travel time (and fuel consumption), improve on-time delivery rate.

**Strategy 2: Optimized Delivery Time Windows and Customer Communication**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** High rate of failed deliveries leading to re-delivery costs.
- **Root Cause:** Customers not being available during the delivery window.
- **Process Mining Support:** Analysis shows clusters of failed deliveries in certain areas or time windows. Also, long dwell times when customers are not home.
- **Proposal:** Use historical data to predict the best time windows for delivery in each area. Implement proactive customer communication (SMS/App notifications) with more accurate ETAs based on real-time progress (using the discovered process model and current position).
- **Expected Impact:** Reduce failed delivery rate, reduce service time (by avoiding waiting), and reduce re-delivery costs.

**Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** Unscheduled maintenance during shifts causing delays.
- **Root Cause:** Vehicle breakdowns due to lack of timely maintenance.
- **Process Mining Support:** Analysis of maintenance logs and vehicle usage patterns (mileage, engine hours, breakdown events) to identify patterns (e.g., a certain model breaks after 10,000 km). Also, impact analysis shows that breakdowns lead to significant delays.
- **Proposal:** Develop a predictive maintenance model that schedules maintenance based on vehicle usage (from GPS and event logs) and failure patterns. Schedule maintenance during off-hours to avoid disrupting delivery.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduce unscheduled stops, increase vehicle utilization, reduce maintenance costs (by avoiding major repairs).

### 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

**Operational Constraints:**
- **Driver Working Hours:** Any optimization (e.g., dynamic routing) must respect legal driving hours and breaks. The system should monitor accumulated driving time and plan routes accordingly.
- **Vehicle Capacities:** Dynamic routing must consider the current load and capacity of the vehicle when assigning new packages or rerouting.
- **Customer Time Windows:** Any change to the route must still respect the promised time windows. If a delay is unavoidable, the system should notify the customer.

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- Implement process mining dashboards that track:
  - Real-time KPIs: On-Time Delivery Rate, Failed Delivery Rate, Average Delivery Time, Fuel Consumption.
  - Process Views: Live process map showing current bottlenecks, conformance checking alerts for major deviations.
  - Historical Trends: Compare KPIs before and after optimizations.
- Set up alerts for critical issues (e.g., a vehicle breakdown, a route with multiple late deliveries).
- Regularly update the process models to detect new patterns (e.g., emerging traffic hotspots, changes in driver behavior).

### Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels

#### 1. **Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

**Data Preprocessing and Integration:**  
- **Integration Strategy:**  
  - Create a unified event log by merging data sources using common keys: `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Timestamp`, and `Case ID (Vehicle-Day)`.  
  - Enrich events with contextual attributes:  
    - GPS data  Derive "Travel Activity" segments between scanner events.  
    - Dispatch data  Add planned stop sequence/time windows as event attributes.  
    - Maintenance logs  Flag unscheduled stops as "Maintenance Deviation."  
  - Abstract low-level GPS events (e.g., "Low Speed Detected") into business-level activities like "Traffic Delay" using speed thresholds (<10 km/h for >5 mins).  
- **Challenges:**  
  - Temporal alignment (e.g., GPS vs. scanner time drift).  
  - Handling missing events (e.g., unscanned "Arrive Customer" inferred from GPS dwell time).  
  - Resolving conflicting events (e.g., "Depart Customer" without prior "Arrive").  

**Process Discovery:**  
- Apply **heuristic mining** to visualize end-to-end flows, emphasizing:  
  - Parallel paths (e.g., successful vs. failed deliveries).  
  - Loops (e.g., reattempted deliveries).  
  - Deviations (e.g., "Unscheduled Maintenance" during route).  
- Generate **subprocess models** for critical segments: depot departure  first delivery, inter-stop travel, customer interaction.  

**Conformance Checking:**  
- Compare discovered models against **planned dispatch routes** using token-based replay. Key deviations:  
  - **Sequence deviations**: Stops visited out-of-order (e.g., planned Stop 1  Stop 2 vs. actual Stop 2  Stop 1).  
  - **Timing deviations**: Travel time exceeding planned duration by >30% (calculated from GPS segments).  
  - **Unplanned events**: Maintenance stops or unsupported activities (e.g., "Personal Detour" inferred from GPS).  
  - **Resource deviations**: Driver/vehicle swaps mid-route.  

#### 2. **Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

**Relevant KPIs and Calculations:**  
| KPI | Calculation | Data Source |  
|------|-------------|-------------|  
| On-Time Delivery Rate | (Count of deliveries within time window) ÷ (Total deliveries) | Scanner timestamps vs. dispatch time windows |  
| Avg. Service Time per Stop | Avg.(“Depart Customer” – “Arrive Customer”) | Scanner events |  
| Travel:Service Ratio | Total travel time ÷ Total service time | GPS (travel) + Scanner (service) |  
| Fuel Efficiency | (Total fuel consumed) ÷ (Total km traveled) | GPS distance + Fuel logs (or estimated via engine idling time) |  
| Vehicle Utilization | (Active driving time) ÷ (Shift duration) | GPS "moving" status vs. shift timestamps |  
| Failed Delivery Rate | (Failed attempts) ÷ (Total attempts) | Scanner "Delivery Failed" events |  

**Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**  
- **Performance Spectrum Analysis**: Pinpoint stages with longest waiting times (e.g., traffic jams between 8:00–9:00 AM).  
- **Resource Profiling**: Compare driver-specific service times or vehicle-specific breakdown frequencies.  
- **Spatial-Temporal Analysis**: Overlay process delays on map coordinates to identify congestion hotspots (e.g., downtown area latency).  
- **Quantification**: Calculate bottleneck impact via delay propagation (e.g., 15-min traffic delay  22% cascade effect on subsequent stops).  

#### 3. **Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

**Root Causes and Validation Methods:**  
- **Suboptimal Routing**:  
  - *Validation*: Conformance checking showing >40% route deviations in urban zones; variant analysis revealing faster alternative paths.  
- **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimates**:  
  - *Validation*: Correlation between planned travel times (dispatch) vs. actuals (GPS) showing consistent underestimation in peak hours.  
- **Traffic Congestion**:  
  - *Validation*: GPS speed data clustered in specific areas/times; dwell-time analysis showing high "Low Speed" event correlation with delays.  
- **Service Time Variability**:  
  - *Validation*: Clustering of service times by location type (e.g., apartments avg. 8.2 mins vs. houses avg. 4.1 mins).  
- **Vehicle Breakdowns**:  
  - *Validation*: Pareto analysis linking high-mileage vehicles to unscheduled maintenance during shifts.  
- **Driver Behavior**:  
  - *Validation*: Social network analysis showing experienced drivers have 18% faster service times.  
- **Failed Deliveries**:  
  - *Validation* detection detection showing 70% of failures occur in narrow time windows (<30 mins).  

#### 4. **Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Engine**  
- **Target**: Traffic delays and route deviations.  
- **Root Cause**: Static planning ignoring real-time conditions.  
- **Data Support**: Process mining reveals 35% of routes deviate due to traffic; GPS data identifies recurrent congestion zones.  
- **Implementation**: Integrate real-time traffic APIs with dispatch; reroute based on live conditions and historical delay patterns.  
- **Expected Impact**:  Travel time by 15–20%,  On-time delivery by 25%,  Fuel use by 10%.  

**Strategy 2: Time Window Optimization & Proactive Customer Alerts**  
- **Target**: Failed deliveries and service time variability.  
- **Root Cause**: Inflexible windows and poor customer availability.  
- **Data Support**: Failed delivery clusters in 10–12 AM slots; service time analysis shows 40% variability from customer unpreparedness.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Redesign time windows using historical success/failure patterns.  
  - Send automated ETA updates via SMS/app 15 mins before arrival.  
- **Expected Impact**:  Failed deliveries by 50%,  Service time by 20%.  

**Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**  
- **Target**: Unscheduled maintenance during shifts.  
- **Root Cause**: Reactive maintenance causing route disruptions.  
- **Data Support**: Process mining shows breakdowns cause 45-min avg. delays; maintenance logs correlate failures with mileage thresholds.  
- **Implementation**: Train ML model (using engine hours, mileage, past failures) to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours.  
- **Expected Impact**:  Mid-shift breakdowns by 70%,  Vehicle utilization by 15%.  

#### 5. **Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

**Addressing Constraints:**  
- **Driver Hours**: Dynamic routing respects shift end times; algorithms prioritize time-sensitive deliveries first.  
- **Vehicle Capacity**: Real-time load tracking prevents over-assignment; rerouting considers capacity when adding pickups.  
- **Time Windows**: Optimization algorithms penalize solutions violating customer constraints.  

**Continuous Monitoring Plan:**  
- **Dashboard KPIs**: Real-time On-time Delivery Rate, Travel:Service Ratio, Failed Delivery Rate.  
- **Process Views**:  
  - Live conformance heatmap (planned vs. actual routes).  
  - Bottleneck alarm system (e.g., traffic delay >20 mins triggers alert).  
  - Driver performance scorecards (service time, compliance).  
- **Sustainability Checks**:  
  - Monthly variant analysis to detect new deviation patterns.  
  - A/B testing of optimization strategies (e.g., dynamic routing vs. legacy).  
  - Cost tracking (fuel/maintenance) against baseline.  

This approach leverages process mining to transform raw event data into actionable insights, targeting Speedy Parcels’ core challenges through integrated, data-driven interventions. Continuous monitoring ensures adaptations to evolving operational conditions.
