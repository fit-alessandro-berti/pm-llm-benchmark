## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### 1.1 Data Preprocessing and Integration Strategy

**Integration Approach:**

The integration of heterogeneous data sources requires a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:

**Stage 1: Data Harmonization**
- **Timestamp Synchronization**: Ensure all sources use consistent timezone and timestamp formats (ISO 8601). Address potential clock drift between GPS trackers and scanners using depot synchronization events as calibration points.
- **Case ID Definition**: Establish a composite case identifier strategy:
  - **Primary Level**: `Vehicle-Day` (e.g., V12-20241205) for overall route execution analysis
  - **Secondary Level**: `Package-ID` for individual delivery journey tracking
  - **Tertiary Level**: `Vehicle-Shift` for driver performance analysis
- **Activity Standardization**: Map diverse event types to a unified activity taxonomy:
  - GPS events  Movement/Status activities (Depart, Arrive, Idle, Traffic Delay)
  - Scanner events  Delivery Milestones (Scan, Delivery Success/Fail, Customer Interaction)
  - Dispatch events  Planning activities (Route Assigned, Expected Times)
  - Maintenance events  Operational Interruptions (Scheduled/Unscheduled Maintenance)

**Stage 2: Event Log Enrichment**

Enhance raw events with derived attributes:
- **Geospatial Clustering**: Map GPS coordinates to delivery zones, traffic corridors, and customer locations
- **Time-Based Features**: Extract time-of-day, day-of-week, holiday indicators, rush-hour flags
- **Calculated Metrics**: Compute dwell times, inter-stop distances, speed deviations from speed limits
- **Contextual Data**: Join with external data (weather conditions, traffic incident reports, road construction schedules)
- **Sequential Features**: Calculate cumulative package load, remaining stops, route progress percentage

**Stage 3: Data Quality Assurance**

Address common data quality issues:
- **Missing Events**: Interpolate missing scanner events using GPS location proximity (if van stopped near customer location without scan, flag for investigation)
- **Duplicate Events**: Remove redundant GPS pings while preserving critical state changes
- **Outlier Detection**: Flag anomalous speed values (>120 km/h), impossible travel times, GPS drift
- **Event Ordering**: Resolve timestamp ties and ensure logical event sequences

**Challenges Anticipated:**

1. **Temporal Granularity Mismatch**: GPS data at 30-second intervals vs. scanner events at irregular intervals. Solution: Interpolate GPS-derived location for scanner events; aggregate GPS events to meaningful state changes.

2. **Event Attribution Ambiguity**: GPS detects "stopped" but no scanner event—is this parking search, traffic, break, or missed scan? Solution: Implement rule-based activity inference using location context, duration, and time-of-day patterns, validated through sample manual verification.

3. **Multi-system Latency**: Scanner events may be buffered and transmitted with delay. Solution: Use event completion timestamps where available; implement event reconciliation windows.

4. **Case Boundary Definition**: Vehicles may have multiple depot departures per day (split shifts, mid-day reload). Solution: Use trip-based segmentation triggered by depot departure/arrival pairs.

5. **Resource Perspective Complexity**: Both driver and vehicle are resources, with many-to-many relationships over time. Solution: Create composite resource identifiers and maintain separate analytical perspectives.

### 1.2 Process Discovery Methodology

**Discovery Algorithm Selection:**

Apply a multi-algorithmic approach for comprehensive insights:

**Level 1: High-Level Process Flow (Fuzzy Miner/Directly-Follows Graph)**
- Generate an aggregated view showing main process flow: Depot Departure  Navigation  Delivery Stop Sequence  Depot Return
- Filter low-frequency deviations initially to identify main process patterns
- Reveal high-level variants (e.g., routes with maintenance stops, routes with failed deliveries requiring returns)

**Level 2: Detailed Activity Analysis (Inductive Miner)**
- Discover hierarchical process structure showing:
  - **Outer loop**: Daily route execution
  - **Inner loop**: Individual delivery stop execution (Arrive  Park  Walk  Customer Interaction  Scan  Return to Vehicle  Depart)
- Capture parallelism (e.g., scanning while walking) and choices (successful vs. failed delivery branches)

**Level 3: Time-Aware Discovery (Performance-annotated models)**
- Overlay temporal statistics on discovered models:
  - Activity durations (mean, median, std dev, percentiles)
  - Waiting times between activities
  - Bottleneck visualization using color-coding

**Visualization Strategy:**

Create multiple process views for different stakeholders:
- **Executive Dashboard**: Simplified process map showing only major phases and aggregate KPIs
- **Operations Manager View**: Detailed delivery stop sub-process with performance metrics
- **Route Planner View**: Geographic process maps overlaying discovered paths on actual street maps
- **Maintenance Manager View**: Filter process to show only events related to vehicle issues

**Variant Analysis:**

Identify and cluster process variants:
- **Successful Route Variants**: Compare different sequence strategies (geographic clustering vs. time window optimization)
- **Problematic Variants**: Routes with unscheduled stops, excessive failed deliveries, overtime
- **Seasonal Variants**: Compare summer vs. winter execution patterns
- **Driver-Specific Variants**: Identify individual driver behavior patterns

### 1.3 Conformance Checking Against Planned Routes

**Conformance Analysis Framework:**

**Phase 1: Prescriptive Model Creation**
- Transform dispatch system's planned routes into normative process models
- Create expected event sequences: Planned Stop Order, Expected Timestamps (±tolerance windows), Expected Geographic Paths

**Phase 2: Multi-Dimensional Conformance Checking**

**a) Control-Flow Conformance (Sequence Deviations):**
- **Metrics**: Fitness (% of observed behavior captured by plan), Precision (% of plan actually followed)
- **Deviations to Detect**:
  - Stop sequence violations (Stop 5 visited before Stop 3)
  - Skipped stops (planned stop never executed)
  - Inserted stops (unplanned locations visited)
  - Loop-backs (returning to previously visited areas)

**b) Temporal Conformance (Timing Deviations):**
- **Metrics**: Compare actual vs. planned arrival times at each stop
- **Deviations to Detect**:
  - Early/late arrivals exceeding customer time windows
  - Accumulated delays (progressive lag from plan as route progresses)
  - Unexpected time gaps (long unexplained periods without activity)
  - Rushed deliveries (significantly faster than planned service time)

**c) Geographic Conformance (Route Deviations):**
- **Metrics**: Calculate spatial deviation between actual GPS traces and planned routes
- **Deviations to Detect**:
  - Different path selection between stops (alternative roads used)
  - Geographic detours (significant deviation from optimal path)
  - Territory violations (entering zones assigned to other vehicles)

**d) Resource Conformance:**
- Verify planned driver-vehicle assignments were followed
- Detect mid-shift driver changes or vehicle swaps

**Phase 3: Deviation Classification and Prioritization**

Categorize deviations by:
- **Frequency**: One-time events vs. systematic patterns
- **Impact**: Calculate delay magnitude, cost implications, customer satisfaction impact
- **Controllability**: Distinguish between controllable (poor planning) vs. uncontrollable (traffic accidents) factors

**Conformance Dashboard Components:**

1. **Overall Conformance Scorecard**: Daily/weekly conformance fitness scores
2. **Heatmap View**: Geographic visualization of conformance issues by delivery zone
3. **Deviation Pareto Analysis**: Rank most frequent/impactful deviation types
4. **Temporal Patterns**: When do conformance issues typically occur (time-of-day, day-of-week)
5. **Root Cause Linkage**: Connect deviations to potential causes (traffic events, vehicle issues, driver actions)

**Expected Deviation Patterns:**

Based on typical logistics challenges:
- **Morning Peak**: Early stops executed on-time, progressive delays accumulate due to optimistic travel time estimates
- **Urban Dense Areas**: Frequent sequence deviations due to parking difficulties and one-way street navigation
- **Failed Delivery Cascades**: Single failed delivery disrupts downstream stop sequence and timing
- **Maintenance Interruptions**: Major temporal deviations following unscheduled vehicle stops

- Identify activities with:
  - **High median duration**: Inherent bottlenecks
  - **High variance**: Unpredictable activities requiring buffer time
  - **Long-tail distributions**: Occasional extreme delays
- **Application**: Reveals that "Finding Parking in Downtown Zone 3" has median 8 minutes vs. 2 minutes in suburban zones

**Technique 2: Temporal Bottleneck Mining**

Analyze time-of-day patterns:
- Segment routes by departure time and analyze performance differences
- Create heatmaps showing average delays by hour and day-of-week
- **Application**: Discover that routes starting 8:00-8:30 AM hit morning traffic, arriving at first stop 30% later than 7:00 AM routes

- **Application**: Top-performing routes show pattern "Grouped Deliveries in Single Building" (multi-drop stops), while low-performing routes scatter single deliveries across wide areas

**Technique 6: Waiting Time Analysis**

Distinguish activity execution time from waiting time:
- Calculate time between consecutive activities (inter-arrival time)
- Identify waiting time patterns: queuing at depot for loading, waiting for customer availability
- **Application**: Discover 25-minute average queue at depot 7:00-8:00 AM as vehicles wait for package loading from overnight sorting

**Technique 7: Resource Performance Analysis**

Compare performance across resources:
- **Driver Comparison**: Analyze average service time, travel efficiency, failed delivery rates per driver
- **Vehicle Comparison**: Compare routes by vehicle type (older vs. newer, different capacities)

   - *Metric*: % of routes affected, occurrences per week

2. **Magnitude Impact**: How severe is the delay when it occurs?
   - *Metric*: Average delay in minutes, delay distribution

3. **Cascade Impact**: Does this bottleneck cause downstream delays?
   - *Metric*: Correlation between early bottleneck and cumulative end-of-route delay

4. **Cost Impact**: What is the financial implication?
   - *Metric*: Additional fuel costs, overtime costs, lost customer satisfaction

5. **Controllability**: Can Speedy Parcels influence this bottleneck?
   - *Classification*: Fully controllable (poor route planning), partially controllable (parking search time), uncontrollable (major traffic accidents)

**Expected Bottleneck Findings:**

Based on typical last-mile logistics challenges:

| Bottleneck Type | Typical Location in Process | Quantified Impact | Addressability |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Depot Morning Congestion | Loading/Departure phase | 20-30 min delay, 40% of routes | High - Stagger start times |
| Urban Parking Search | Dense commercial zones | 5-10 min per stop | Medium - Route optimization, driver training |

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Traffic-Aware Route Optimization

**Targeted Inefficiency:**
- Systematic traffic delays causing 20-30% of routes to exceed planned duration
- Static route planning assuming consistent travel times regardless of time-of-day
- Geographic bottlenecks in specific corridors during peak hours

**Root Cause Addressed:**
- Route planning system uses historical average speeds without accounting for temporal traffic patterns
- Lack of real-time route adjustment capability
- Insufficient buffer time built into schedules for known congestion periods

**Process Mining Insights Supporting This Strategy:**

1. **Conformance Analysis Results**: Planned vs. actual travel time shows systematic 15-25 minute deviations during 8:00-9:30 AM and 12:00-13:00 peak periods, particularly on routes traversing Highway 6 and downtown Zone 2.

2. **Temporal Bottleneck Mining**: Geographic heatmap analysis reveals three consistent traffic hotspots accounting for 45% of all significant delays:
   - Highway 6 eastbound (morning commute)
   - Downtown Zone 2 (lunchtime traffic + delivery truck congestion)
   - Industrial Park access road (shift change 14:00-15:00)

3. **Variant Analysis**: Routes starting 7:00-7:30 AM complete 12% faster than 8:00-8:30 AM routes with identical stop lists, demonstrating time-of-day impact.

4. **Cost Quantification**: Traffic delays contribute estimated €12,000/month in excess fuel costs (idling), €18,000/month in overtime, and 8% reduction in OTDR.

**Proposed Implementation:**

**Phase 1: Enhanced Route Planning (Months 1-3)**
- **Action**: Integrate real-time traffic data APIs (Google Maps, HERE, TomTom) into route planning system
- **Mechanism**: Update routing algorithm to use time-dependent travel time matrices instead of static distances
- **Specific Change**: For each route, calculate expected travel times for actual execution window (not generic averages)
- **Example**: Route planned for 8:30 AM departure uses 8:30-14:00 traffic predictions; route planned for 13:00 departure uses 13:00-19:00 predictions

**Phase 2: Departure Time Optimization (Months 2-4)**
- **Action**: Use process mining insights to optimize route start times to avoid traffic peaks
- **Mechanism**: Stagger depot departures based on route destinations
- **Specific Change**:
  - Routes to eastern zones depart 7:00-7:30 (before Highway 6 congestion)
  - Routes to western zones depart 7:45-8:15 (avoid depot congestion, different traffic pattern)
  - Downtown routes depart post-morning rush (9:00+) with lunch completion before midday peak

**Phase 3: Dynamic Mid-Route Adjustment (Months 4-6)**
- **Action**: Implement real-time route modification capability based on live traffic conditions
- **Mechanism**: Drivers receive updated stop sequences via mobile app when significant traffic events detected
- **Trigger Conditions**: When traffic incident adds >15 minutes to planned route, system recalculates optimal remaining sequence
- **Driver Notification**: "Traffic on Highway 6. Rerouting: Proceed to Stop 8 (Johnson St) instead of Stop 6. New sequence sent."

**Phase 4: Predictive Scheduling (Months 5-7)**
- **Action**: Build predictive models using 6 months of process mining data to forecast travel times
- **Mechanism**: Machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on historical GPS data with features:
  - Origin-destination pair
  - Day-of-week, time-of-day, month
  - Weather conditions
  - Special events (from calendar API)
- **Output**: More accurate travel time estimates (prediction intervals, not point estimates) for planning buffer allocation

**Technology Requirements:**
- Integration of traffic API (estimated cost: €2,500/month for API calls)
- Update to routing optimization software (one-time: €45,000)
- Driver mobile app enhancement (€20,000 development)
- Training dataset creation from event logs (internal resource time)

**Expected KPI Impacts:**

| KPI | Current State | Expected Improvement | Target State |
|-----|---------------|----------------------|--------------|
| On-Time Delivery Rate | 87% | +8-10 percentage points | 95-97% |
| Average Route Duration | 8.2 hours | -25 to -35 minutes | 7.6-7.8 hours |
| Overtime Frequency | 35% of routes | -20 percentage points | 15% of routes |
| Traffic Delay Incidents | 2.8 per route | -1.2 incidents | 1.6 per route |
| Fuel Cost per Route | €42 | -€5-7 (less idling) | €35-37 |
| Customer Time Window Violations | 13% | -7 percentage points | 6% |

**Return on Investment:**
- Monthly savings: €18,000 (overtime) + €12,000 (fuel) + €8,000 (improved customer satisfaction/retention) = €38,000
- Implementation cost: €67,500 one-time + €2,500/month ongoing = €97,500 first year
- **Payback period**: 2.4 months
- **Annual ROI**: 380%

**Operational Constraints Consideration:**
- Route adjustments must respect customer time windows (system constraint)
- Driver working hours limited to 10 hours (legal constraint) - better planning reduces overtime violations
- Vehicle capacity constraints maintained (not affected by routing changes)
- Changes validated in pilot zone before fleet-wide rollout

### Strategy 2: Customer Communication and Time Window Optimization

**Targeted Inefficiency:**
- Failed delivery rate of 28% requiring costly re-delivery attempts
- Customer unavailability during standard delivery windows (particularly residential 9:00-17:00)
- Wasted driver time and route disruption from failed attempts
- Customer dissatisfaction from missed deliveries

**Root Cause Addressed:**
- Lack of proactive customer communication about delivery timing
- Generic time windows (e.g., "9 AM - 5 PM") provide little value to customers
- No mechanism for customers to influence delivery timing
- Driver arrival timing unpredictable due to route execution variability
- Customer behavior patterns not incorporated into scheduling

**Process Mining Insights Supporting This Strategy:**

1. **Failed Delivery Analysis**: 
   - Residential deliveries 10:00-15:00: 35% failure rate ("Customer Not Home")
   - Residential deliveries 17:00-19:00: 12% failure rate
   - Commercial deliveries: 8% failure rate (reception available)
   - Failed attempts cost average €11 per package (driver time + re-delivery + administrative overhead)

2. **Decision Mining Results**: Predictive model identifies key failure risk factors:
   - Residential + Midday (10:00-15:00) = 65% failure probability
   - First delivery attempt to address = 28% failure rate vs. 15% for repeat addresses (customer expects deliveries)
   - No advance notification = 32% failure rate vs. 14% with notification

3. **Service Time Variability**: 
   - Successful deliveries: Average 3.2 minutes
   - Failed attempts: Average 4.8 minutes (driver attempts contact, leaves notice, updates system)
   - Differential: 1.6 minutes × 9.8 failed attempts per route = 15.7 minutes wasted per route

4. **Cascade Effect Analysis**:
   - Routes with 3 failed deliveries finish 35 minutes later on average
   - Driver behavioral changes observed (rushing subsequent stops, reduced service quality)
   - Psychological stress indicator: failed delivery clusters correlate with increased harsh braking events

5. **Cost Quantification**:
   - 280 failed deliveries per day across fleet
   - Re-delivery costs: 280 × €11 = €3,080/day = €66,000/month
   - Customer dissatisfaction impact: estimated 8% customer churn increase in high-failure zones

**Proposed Implementation:**

**Phase 1: Predictive Delivery Time Notification (Months 1-2)**

**Action**: Implement automated customer notification system with predicted delivery windows

**Mechanism**:
- Extract historical route performance data from process mining analysis
- Calculate typical delivery sequence timing for each route type/zone
- As route begins execution, predict ETA for each stop using:
  - Current position (GPS)
  - Remaining stops
  - Historical performance for this route profile
  - Current traffic conditions
  - Time already elapsed vs. plan

**Customer Notification Flow**:
1. **Night Before**: "Your package will be delivered tomorrow between 2:00-4:00 PM" (based on historical route performance)
2. **Morning Update**: "Delivery expected 2:30-3:30 PM" (refined based on actual route start time and current conditions)
3. **Near Real-Time**: "Driver is 3 stops away, expect delivery in 30-45 minutes" (when driver within 1 hour)
4. **Imminent Alert**: "Driver is approaching your location" (2-3 stops away, ~15 min ETA)

**Communication Channels**:
- SMS text messages (primary - 94% open rate)
- Email (secondary)
- Mobile app push notifications (for customers who download app)
- Tracking portal web page

**Phase 2: Customer Delivery Preference Collection (Months 2-3)**

**Action**: Enable customers to specify delivery preferences during order placement or via tracking portal

**Preference Options**:
1. **Preferred Time Windows**: "Prefer delivery after 5:00 PM" or "Morning deliveries best"
2. **Alternative Delivery Locations**: Neighbor authorization, building reception, secure location instructions
3. **Access Instructions**: "Use side gate," "Ring apartment 3B," "Access code: 1234"
4. **Notification Preferences**: Which channels, phone number verification

**Route Planning Integration**:
- Incorporate customer preferences as soft constraints in routing algorithm
- Group "evening preferred" customers into later route sequences
- Prioritize customers with narrow availability windows
- Flag addresses with special access instructions for driver visibility

**Phase 3: Dynamic Customer Response Options (Months 3-5)**

**Action**: Allow customers to make limited adjustments when they receive notifications

**Interactive Options**:
1. **Redirect to Alternative Location**: 
   - "I won't be home, please deliver to my workplace" (if within same general route area)
   - "Please leave with neighbor at 123 Main St"
   - "Hold for pickup at depot"

2. **Reschedule Request**:
   - "I won't be available, please deliver tomorrow"
   - System evaluates: if driver hasn't yet passed nearby area, reschedule; otherwise, continue with attempt

3. **Authorization to Leave Package**:
   - "Please leave package at back door" (photo confirmation required)
   - "Permission to leave in building lobby"

**Operational Rules**:
- Changes only accepted until driver is 5+ stops away (prevents route chaos)
- Redirects only permitted within 2 km radius (route efficiency maintained)
- Liability waivers for "leave package" authorizations

**Phase 4: Continuous Learning and Optimization (Months 4-6)**

**Action**: Use ongoing process mining to refine time predictions and scheduling

**Mechanism**:
- Monthly retraining of ETA prediction models with latest route performance data
- Track notification accuracy: predicted window vs. actual delivery time
- Measure notification impact: failure rate reduction by customer engagement level
- Identify persistent high-failure zones for special interventions (e.g., evening-only delivery routes)

**Advanced Feature - Delivery Appointment Scheduling**:
- For high-value shipments or chronic failure addresses: offer specific 1-hour appointment windows
- Customer selects from available slots (based on route flexibility)
- Premium service: guaranteed window with compensation if missed
- Implementation after pilot success

**Technology Requirements:**
- SMS gateway subscription (€0.03 per message, estimated 1,200 messages/day = €1,080/month)
- ETA prediction algorithm development using process mining models (€25,000 one-time)
- Customer portal enhancement (€30,000 development)
- Integration with existing dispatch system (€15,000)
- CRM system updates (€10,000)

**Expected KPI Impacts:**

| KPI | Current State | Expected Improvement | Target State |
|-----|---------------|----------------------|--------------|
| First-Attempt Delivery Success Rate | 72% | +13-18 percentage points | 85-90% |
| Failed Delivery Rate | 28% | -13-18 percentage points | 10-15% |
| Customer "Not Home" Failures | 35% (residential, midday) | -18-22 percentage points | 13-17% |
| Re-delivery Costs | €66,000/month | -€35,000-45,000 | €21,000-31,000/month |
| Average Service Time (failed) | 4.8 minutes | -1.2 minutes | 3.6 minutes |
| Customer Satisfaction Score | 7.2/10 | +0.8-1.2 points | 8.0-8.4/10 |
| Route Completion Time | 8.2 hours | -12-18 minutes | 7.9-8.0 hours |

**Return on Investment:**
- Monthly savings: €40,000 (avoided re-delivery costs) + €5,000 (driver time efficiency) + €8,000 (improved customer retention) = €53,000
- Implementation cost: €80,000 one-time + €1,080/month ongoing = €92,960 first year
- **Payback period**: 1.7 months
- **Annual ROI**: 580%

**Additional Benefits (Qualitative):**
- Enhanced customer experience and brand perception
- Competitive differentiation in market
- Reduced customer service call volume
- Driver satisfaction improvement (fewer frustrating failed attempts)
- Data collection on customer preferences for future service development

**Operational Constraints Consideration:**
- Customer redirects must maintain route efficiency (maximum 2 km deviation enforced)
- Reschedule requests balanced against service level commitments
- Driver working hours protected (better success rate reduces route duration)
- Privacy and data protection compliance (GDPR) for customer contact information
- Notification system redundancy (if SMS fails, email backup)

### Strategy 3: Predictive Vehicle Maintenance and Fleet Optimization

**Targeted Inefficiency:**
- Unscheduled vehicle breakdowns during delivery routes causing 45-60 minute disruptions
- 12% of routes experience mid-shift mechanical issues
- Inconsistent vehicle performance leading to route execution variability
- Reactive maintenance approach resulting in cascading failures
- Aging fleet segments with 3-4x higher breakdown rates

**Root Cause Addressed:**
- Lack of predictive maintenance based on actual vehicle usage patterns
- Scheduled maintenance follows calendar intervals (e.g., "every 6 months") rather than condition-based triggers
- Aging vehicles (>6 years) remain in high-utilization service despite elevated failure risk
- Insufficient correlation between vehicle health indicators and breakdown probability
- No operational feedback loop between route execution data and maintenance planning

**Process Mining Insights Supporting This Strategy:**

1. **Unscheduled Breakdown Analysis**:
   - 62 mid-shift breakdowns in 6-month period across 50-vehicle fleet
   - Average breakdown duration: 52 minutes (includes diagnosis, decision-making, alternative arrangement)
   - Breakdown impact: 78% of affected routes finish late, 45% require overtime, 23% have packages rerouted to next day
   - Affected routes deliver average 8.2 fewer packages (26% of planned stops)

2. **Vehicle Performance Correlation**:
   - Vehicles >6 years old: 3.2x higher breakdown rate (8.1% of routes vs. 2.5% for newer vehicles)
   - Vehicles with missed scheduled maintenance: 2.7x higher breakdown probability within 30 days
   - High-utilization vehicles (>200 km/day average): 1.9x higher breakdown rate
   - Specific vehicle models (V-series 2015-2017): 4.1x higher breakdown rate (design flaw in transmission)

3. **Early Warning Indicators Identified**:
   - GPS speed profile anomalies 2-5 days before breakdown: 73% correlation
     - Reduced maximum speed (struggling acceleration)
     - Increased idle time (rough idling, driver attempting to address issue)
     - More frequent stops (investigating warning lights/sounds)
   - "Unscheduled Stop" events with "checking vehicle" notes: 68% followed by breakdown within 72 hours

4. **Maintenance Log Analysis**:
   - Scheduled-to-unscheduled maintenance ratio: 1:2.3 (highly reactive, not preventive)
   - Average vehicle downtime per breakdown: 14 hours (includes diagnosis, parts acquisition, repair)
   - Seasonal pattern: 40% more breakdowns in winter months (cold weather stress on older vehicles)
   - Component failure patterns: 38% transmission/drivetrain, 25% electrical systems, 18% brake systems, 19% other

5. **Cost Quantification**:
   - Direct costs per breakdown: €320 (towing, emergency repair labor premiums, parts expediting)
   - Indirect costs per breakdown: €180 (route disruption, package redelivery, overtime)
   - Total monthly cost: 10.3 breakdowns × €500 = €5,150/month
   - Opportunity cost: Lost delivery capacity = 520 packages/month × €8 revenue = €4,160/month
   - **Total impact: €9,310/month**

6. **Process Variant Analysis**:
   - Routes assigned to high-reliability vehicles (breakdown rate <1%) complete 7% faster on average
   - Driver confidence factor: experienced drivers request not to be assigned problematic vehicles, disrupting optimal driver-route matching

**Proposed Implementation:**

**Phase 1: Predictive Maintenance Model Development (Months 1-3)**

**Action**: Build machine learning models to predict vehicle breakdown probability using process mining event log data

**Data Features for Prediction Model**:

*Vehicle Characteristics:*
- Vehicle age, model, total mileage, purchase date
- Maintenance history (scheduled completion rate, previous issues)
- Current component status (brake wear, tire condition, fluid levels)

*Operational Usage Patterns (from Event Logs):*
- Average daily distance, cumulative distance since last maintenance
- Speed profile statistics (harsh acceleration count, harsh braking count, maximum speeds)
- Idle time percentage (engine wear indicator)
- Stop frequency (start/stop cycles cause transmission wear)
- Route terrain (if routes through hilly zones = higher stress)
- Temperature exposure (operating in extreme cold/heat)

*Early Warning Signals (from Recent Event Logs):*
- Trend analysis: is average speed declining over past 10 routes?
- Anomaly detection: unusual stop patterns, idle time increases
- "Unscheduled Stop" events with maintenance-related notes
- Driver-reported issues (from daily vehicle inspection logs)

**Model Output**:
- **Risk Score**: 0-100 scale predicting breakdown probability within next 30 days
- **Risk Factors**: Identify primary contributors (e.g., "High mileage + missed last service")
- **Recommended Action**: 
  - Score 0-30: Normal operation
  - Score 31-60: Schedule preventive inspection within 2 weeks
  - Score 61-80: Schedule maintenance within 1 week, reduce route assignment intensity
  - Score 81-100: Immediate inspection required, remove from active rotation

**Model Training and Validation**:
- Training set: 6 months historical data (80% of data)
- Validation set: Most recent 1 month (20% of data)
- Algorithm: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for risk classification
- Performance target: 75%+ recall on predicting breakdowns (minimize false negatives)
- Continuous retraining: Monthly updates with latest data

**Phase 2: Condition-Based Maintenance Scheduling (Months 2-4)**

**Action**: Replace calendar-based maintenance with condition-triggered scheduling

**Traditional Approach**: "Service every 6 months or 20,000 km"
**New Approach**: "Service when predictive model indicates risk score >60 OR traditional threshold reached, whichever comes first"

**Maintenance Trigger Logic**:

*High-Priority Triggers (Immediate Action):*
- Predictive risk score >80
- Critical warning from driver inspection
- Component failure detected (warning lights)
- Breakdown occurred (obvious)

*Medium-Priority Triggers (Schedule within 1 week):*
- Predictive risk score 61-80
- 90% of recommended service interval reached
- Performance degradation detected (speed profile anomalies)

*Low-Priority Triggers (Schedule within 2-3 weeks):*
- Predictive risk score 31-60
- Seasonal maintenance (e.g., winter preparation)
- Minor issues accumulated

**Operational Integration**:
- Daily automated risk score calculation for entire fleet
- Maintenance dashboard showing vehicle health status (green/yellow/red)
- Automated alerts to fleet manager when triggers activated
- Proactive scheduling: when vehicle reaches yellow status, begin scheduling to minimize operational disruption

**Phase 3: Fleet Composition Optimization (Months 3-6)**

**Action**: Data-driven fleet renewal strategy based on lifecycle cost analysis

**Vehicle Lifecycle Analysis Using Process Mining Data**:

For each vehicle, calculate total cost of ownership:
- **Acquisition cost** (amortized over vehicle life)
- **Fuel costs** (from operational data - distance × fuel efficiency)
- **Maintenance costs** (scheduled + unscheduled from logs)
- **Breakdown disruption costs** (from event log impact analysis)
- **Depreciation**

**Identify Optimal Replacement Timing**:
- Plot TCO curve by vehicle age: identifies inflection point where keeping vehicle becomes more expensive than replacing
- Process mining insight: V-series 2015-2017 models reach inflection at 4.5 years (earlier than expected 7 years)
- **Recommendation**: Accelerate replacement for these high-risk vehicles

**Replacement Priority Matrix**:

| Priority | Criteria | Action | Vehicles Identified |
|----------|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Immediate | Age >7 years + high breakdown rate | Replace within 3 months | V03, V07, V12, V19 (4 vehicles) |
| High | Age 5-7 years + above-average costs | Replace within 6-12 months | V08, V15, V23, V28, V31 (5 vehicles) |
| Medium | Age 5-7 years + average performance | Monitor, plan replacement 12-18 months | 8 vehicles |
| Low | Age <5 years OR excellent performance | Continue operation | 33 vehicles |

**Financial Analysis**:
- Immediate priority vehicles cost €2,100/month average (vs. €850 fleet average)
- Replacing 4 vehicles: €120,000 capital (€30k per vehicle)
- Monthly savings: 4 × (€2,100 - €850) = €5,000
- Payback: 24 months, but improved reliability has additional unmeasured value (customer satisfaction, schedule reliability)

**Phase 4: Intelligent Vehicle-Route Assignment (Months 4-6)**

**Action**: Match vehicles to routes based on vehicle condition and route demands

**Route Demand Profiling** (from process mining analysis):
- **High-Demand Routes**: Long distance (>150 km), many stops (>40), challenging terrain, tight time windows
  - Require: Highest-reliability vehicles, good fuel efficiency, comfortable driver cabin (driver fatigue factor)
  - Examples: Rural extended routes, high-volume commercial zones

- **Medium-Demand Routes**: Moderate distance/stops, urban environment, standard time expectations
  - Require: Average vehicle performance adequate
  - Examples: Suburban residential routes, mixed zones

- **Low-Demand Routes**: Short distance (<100 km), fewer stops (<25), flexible timing
  - Appropriate for: Older vehicles with higher risk scores (breakdown less catastrophic), training routes for new vehicles (break-in period)
  - Examples: Concentrated urban cores, backup/overflow routes

**Assignment Algorithm**:
```
For each day:
  1. Calculate current vehicle risk scores (from predictive model)
  2. Rank routes by demand/criticality
  3. Assign lowest-risk vehicles to highest-demand routes
  4. Assign medium-risk vehicles to medium-demand routes
  5. Assign higher-risk vehicles to low-demand routes OR hold for inspection
  6. Never assign risk score >60 vehicles to high-demand routes
```

**Expected Benefit**:
- Reduce breakdown impact on critical routes
- Extend usable life of aging vehicles (appropriate assignment reduces stress)
- Improve schedule reliability for customer-critical routes

**Technology Requirements:**
- Predictive analytics platform (€35,000 license, €5,000/year maintenance)
- Integration with maintenance management system (€15,000)
- Data pipeline from process mining event logs to prediction model (€12,000)
- Fleet manager dashboard development (€18,000)
- Training for maintenance and dispatch teams (€5,000)
- Vehicle replacement capital (€120,000 for 4 vehicles) - separate capital budget

**Expected KPI Impacts:**

| KPI | Current State | Expected Improvement | Target State |
|-----|---------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Mid-Route Breakdown Rate | 12% of routes | -8-9 percentage points | 3-4% of routes |
| Average Breakdown Frequency | 10.3 per month | -6-7 per month | 3-4 per month |
| Scheduled:Unscheduled Maintenance Ratio | 1:2.3 | Improve to 2:1 | More preventive, less reactive |
| Average Vehicle Downtime per Issue | 14 hours | -4 hours | 10 hours (proactive parts stocking) |
| Monthly Breakdown Costs | €9,310 | -€6,200 | €3,110 |
| Route Completion Reliability | 88% | +7-9 percentage points | 95-97% |
| Fleet Average Age | 5.2 years | Optimize mix | 4.5 years (targeted replacement) |
| Fuel Efficiency | 11.2 L/100km | +0.4-0.6 L/100km | 10.6-10.8 L/100km (better maintenance) |

**Return on Investment:**

*Recurring Savings:*
- Avoided breakdown costs: €6,200/month
- Fuel efficiency improvement: €2,800/month (better-maintained engines)
- Reduced route disruptions: €3,500/month (fewer failed routes, less overtime)
- **Total monthly savings: €12,500**

*Implementation Costs:*
- One-time: €85,000 (technology and integration)
- Ongoing: €5,000/year (€417/month)
- Capital: €120,000 vehicle replacement (separate ROI analysis)

**Payback period (excluding vehicle capital): 6.8 months**
**Annual ROI: 155%**

**Additional Benefits:**
- Extended vehicle lifespan through better maintenance (avoid premature retirement)
- Improved driver safety (fewer in-route mechanical failures)
- Enhanced schedule reliability (compound benefits with Strategy 1)
- Better capital planning (data-driven replacement decisions)
- Environmental benefits (better-maintained vehicles produce fewer emissions)

**Operational Constraints Consideration:**
- Maintenance scheduling must balance with fleet availability (ensure sufficient vehicles for daily operations)
- Driver reassignment when vehicles taken for maintenance (dispatch complexity)
- Parts inventory optimization (stock common failure parts based on predictive insights)
- Maintenance facility capacity planning (if more preventive maintenance, ensure adequate bay availability)
- Warranty consideration for newer vehicles (schedule preventive maintenance within warranty periods)

## 5. Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring

### 5.1 Accounting for Operational Constraints

The proposed optimization strategies must be implemented within the reality of complex operational constraints. Here's how each constraint type is specifically addressed:

**Constraint Category 1: Driver Working Hours and Labor Regulations**

**Regulatory Framework:**
- Maximum 10-hour shift duration (including breaks)
- Mandatory 30-minute break after 6 hours of driving
- 11-hour rest period between shifts required
- Maximum 48-hour average work week over 4 months
- Overtime compensation at 1.5× base rate after 8 hours

**Strategy Integration:**

*Strategy 1 (Dynamic Routing):*
- Route optimization algorithm includes "maximum shift duration" as hard constraint
- Real-time route adjustments evaluate remaining time before triggering overtime conditions
- If system detects route will exceed 10 hours, proactive rerouting or package reassignment to other vehicles initiated
- Driver mobile app shows countdown to break requirement, overtime threshold
- **Benefit**: Reduced overtime frequency from 35% to projected 15% actually helps compliance

*Strategy 2 (Customer Communication):*
- Better delivery success rates reduce route duration, creating buffer before overtime threshold
- Predictive ETA system accounts for required break times in delivery windows
- Evening delivery preferences clustered into dedicated evening routes (within normal hours, just later start time)

*Strategy 3 (Predictive Maintenance):*
- Maintenance scheduling avoids taking vehicles out-of-service during peak periods (Monday mornings, pre-holidays)
- When vehicle needs maintenance, schedule for end-of-shift or day off to minimize driver idle time
- Backup vehicle rotation ensures drivers have work even when primary vehicle serviced

**Implementation Monitoring:**
- Dashboard tracks hours per driver per shift, cumulative weekly hours
- Automated alerts when driver approaching overtime threshold
- Compliance report showing break adherence, rest period verification

---

**Constraint Category 2: Vehicle Capacity Limitations**

**Physical Constraints:**
- Vehicle cargo capacity: 12-15 m³ depending on vehicle model
- Weight limit: 1,200-1,500 kg
- Package dimensions: Must fit through van doors and aisles
- Loading sequence affects unloading efficiency

**Strategy Integration:**

*Strategy 1 (Dynamic Routing):*
- Route adjustments never allow package reassignment exceeding receiving vehicle's remaining capacity
- System tracks cumulative package volume/weight for each vehicle in real-time
- Dynamic redirects (customer requests) only permitted if capacity allows

*Strategy 2 (Customer Communication):*
- When customer requests redirect to alternative address on different route, system checks if that vehicle has capacity
- If redirect would cause capacity violation, customer informed: "Sorry, the vehicle serving that area is at full capacity. Alternative: hold for pickup at depot or schedule for tomorrow?"

*Strategy 3 (Predictive Maintenance):*
- When vehicle taken for maintenance, its planned packages redistributed to other vehicles
- Distribution algorithm respects capacity constraints (may require splitting package load across multiple vehicles)
- If insufficient fleet capacity, some packages delayed to next day (prioritize time-sensitive shipments)

**Loading Optimization Enhancement:**
- Process mining can reveal inefficient loading patterns (if scanner data includes loading sequence)
- Optimize loading order: packages for later stops loaded first (back of van), early stops accessible near doors
- Reduces time searching for packages at each stop

---

**Constraint Category 3: Customer Time Windows**

**Commitment Framework:**
- Standard residential: 9 AM - 6 PM window
- Narrow commercial windows: Often 8 AM - 4 PM (business hours)
- Premium service customers: 2-hour guaranteed windows
- Contractual penalties for repeated window violations (large commercial clients)

**Strategy Integration:**

*Strategy 1 (Dynamic Routing):*
- Customer time windows encoded as hard constraints in routing algorithm
- Route modifications evaluated against time window feasibility before implementation
- If traffic delay threatens time window violations, system prioritizes:
  1. Premium customers (contractual obligations)
  2. Customers with narrowest windows
  3. Commercial addresses (closes at specific time)
  4. Residential (more flexible)

*Strategy 2 (Customer Communication):*
- Narrowed predicted windows (e.g., "2:30-3:30 PM") derived from process mining historical data
- If route running late, customers automatically notified: "Revised delivery time: 3:45-4:45 PM"
- Gives customers option to reschedule if they can't accommodate new window
- Failed delivery prevention: proactive notification better than surprising customer with late arrival

*Strategy 3 (Predictive Maintenance):*
- Maintenance-related delays communicated to affected customers with alternative delivery arrangements
- System identifies time-sensitive shipments on affected vehicle for priority rerouting

**Time Window Performance Tracking:**
- Process mining continuously monitors on-time delivery within windows
- Identifies systematic window violations by zone/route for targeted improvement
- Customer satisfaction surveys link to time window adherence

---

**Constraint Category 4: Fleet Availability and Capacity**

**Operational Realities:**
- Fleet size: 50 vehicles (fixed in short term)
- Daily operational demand: 45-50 vehicles (peak periods use entire fleet)
- Maintenance requirements: 2-3 vehicles unavailable daily on average
- Breakdown contingency: Need 5-10% spare capacity for unexpected issues

**Strategy Integration:**

*Strategy 1 (Dynamic Routing):*
- Cannot create more routes than available vehicles
- If optimization suggests splitting route, only possible if spare vehicle available
- Staggered departure times (proposed) actually improves fleet utilization (reduces depot bottleneck)

*Strategy 2 (Customer Communication):*
- Better delivery success rates mean fewer packages requiring next-day redeliv, reducing fleet demand
- Freed capacity can handle volume growth without fleet expansion

*Strategy 3 (Predictive Maintenance):*
- **Critical constraint management**: Predictive maintenance must be scheduled without creating fleet capacity crisis
- Maintenance scheduling algorithm:
  1. Forecast daily vehicle requirements (historical demand + predicted volume)
  2. Schedule maintenance only when: (Available vehicles - Required vehicles)  2 (safety margin)
  3. Stagger maintenance: avoid multiple vehicles serviced same day
  4. Seasonal adjustment: defer non-urgent maintenance during peak seasons (November-December holiday volume)
- If maintenance backlog accumulates, weekend/overnight servicing for preventive tasks

**Fleet Utilization Dashboard:**
- Daily view: Available vehicles vs. Required vehicles vs. Planned maintenance
- Weekly view: Maintenance calendar, predicted demand, capacity gaps
- Alert system: If projected capacity shortfall, flag for management decision (defer maintenance, rent backup vehicle, reduce service area)

---

**Constraint Category 5: Geographic Service Territory**

**Territory Definitions:**
- Service area: 45 km radius from depot
- Zone assignments: 8 defined geographic zones for route planning
- Contractual service areas with specific clients (must serve regardless of efficiency)
- Competitor territories (cannot poach, though customers can choose Speedy Parcels)

**Strategy Integration:**

*Strategy 1 (Dynamic Routing):*
- Route optimization confined to service territory boundaries
- Inter-zone routing permitted but must consider customer service commitments by zone
- Traffic-based rerouting checks that alternative paths remain within service area

*Strategy 2 (Customer Communication):*
- Delivery redirect requests validated against service territory (cannot redirect 60 km away)
- "Hold for depot pickup" option brings customer to central location (within territory)

*Strategy 3 (Predictive Maintenance):*
- Fleet composition (vehicle types, capacities) planned based on territory demands
- Long-distance zones (outer suburbs) assigned larger, more reliable vehicles

---

### 5.2 Continuous Monitoring Framework

**Objective:** Ensure optimization strategies deliver expected benefits, identify emerging issues early, enable data-driven refinement, and create organizational learning culture.

**Monitoring Architecture:**

**Layer 1: Real-Time Operational Dashboard (Live Monitoring)**

*Purpose*: Enable day-of-operations management and immediate intervention

*Key Metrics and Visualizations:*

1. **Fleet Status Overview**
   - Map view showing current vehicle positions (GPS live feed)
   - Color-coded by status: On-Schedule (green), Minor Delay <15 min (yellow), Major Delay >15 min (red), Breakdown (black)
   - Count: Vehicles departed / In-progress / Returned / Issues
   - Current time vs. planned time for each vehicle

2. **Route Progress Tracking**
   - For each vehicle: Stops completed / Total stops, Packages delivered / Total packages
   - Current stop duration (identify if driver stuck at location)
   - ETA to next stop, ETA to depot return
   - Deviation from plan: minutes ahead/behind schedule

3. **Issue Alert Feed**
   - Live stream of exceptions requiring attention:
     - "V12: Breakdown reported at Zone 3" (critical)
     - "V07: 20 minutes behind schedule after 10 stops" (warning)
     - "V22: Customer redirect request received" (info)
   - Click alert for detailed context and action options
