Okay, that was a very comprehensive description of your property onboarding process. To make sure I've grasped all the nuances, I'd like to ask a few follow-up questions. These are aimed at understanding the flow, decision-making, and handling of variations in more detail.

Here are the questions I would ask:

**Understanding Roles & Handoffs:**

1.  Could you clarify the exact point of handover between the Property Coordinator who handles initial documentation/data entry and the assigned Property Manager? Who owns the property record during that transition?
2.  You mentioned a Leasing Agent might handle tenant screening. Is this a distinct role from the Property Manager in all cases? If so, how do the Property Manager and Leasing Agent coordinate during the tenant selection and lease finalization phases?
3.  Who has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the *entire* onboarding process for a single property is completed successfully from start to finish? Is there a single process owner or is it segmented by phase?

**Decision Criteria & Logic:**

4.  When assigning a Property Manager, you listed several factors (workload, geography, experience, etc.). How are these factors weighted or prioritized, especially if there's a conflict (e.g., the best geographic fit has a high workload)? Who makes the final assignment decision?
5.  During tenant selection with multiple applicants, what specific criteria determine prioritization beyond lease length? How are potentially subjective factors balanced against objective ones like credit scores?
6.  Regarding pricing, how is the initial "expected rental price range" determined before the property manager and marketing team get involved? And what happens if the financial analyst's review finds the agreed-upon rent doesn't meet profitability targets *after* the lease is potentially already being negotiated?

**Timing, Sequencing & Bottlenecks:**

7.  What is the typical end-to-end timeframe you aim for to onboard a property, from initial landlord contact to the property being active and ready for tenants?
8.  Are there specific steps in this process that are known bottlenecks or frequently cause delays? (e.g., documentation verification, inspection remediation).
9.  Can some activities run in parallel? For instance, can the marketing team start creating draft materials while the inspection/remediation process is still underway?

**Exception Handling & Special Cases:**

10. You mentioned handling missing or outdated documentation. What happens if a landlord is ultimately unable or unwilling to provide the required compliant documentation after repeated requests? At what point might the onboarding be halted?
11. How are disagreements resolved if the landlord and the assigned Property Manager have differing views on property policies (like pet rules or maintenance responsibilities) discussed during the introductory meeting? Is there an escalation path?
12. Could you elaborate on the process for handling landlord requests for "custom lease clauses"? Who reviews these for legal compliance and business feasibility, and who has the authority to approve or deny them?
13. What steps are taken differently when onboarding properties requiring "special insurance"? Who is responsible for verifying and managing this aspect?

**Tools & Communication:**

14. You mentioned communication is tracked across emails, CRMs, and project management tools. How do you ensure a single source of truth or consistent view of the property's onboarding status across these different systems?
15. When the inspector identifies issues requiring repairs, how is the communication and coordination between the Property Manager, the landlord, and potentially contractors managed and tracked?

These questions should help me build a clearer picture of the operational details, decision points, and flow of this complex process. Thank you for sharing the initial description!
