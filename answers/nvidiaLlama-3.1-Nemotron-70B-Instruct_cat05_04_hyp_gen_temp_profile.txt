**Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model**

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**:
	* **Issue:** Extremely low standard deviation (1 hour) for an average duration of ~1.04 days.
	* **Implication:** Unnaturally rigid approval schedule, potentially not driven by business logic.
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:
	* **Issue:** Excessively long average delay (7 days) with a high standard deviation (2 days).
	* **Implication:** Inconsistent notification timing, possibly due to internal backlog or resource constraints.
3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:
	* **Issue:** Very short average closure time (2 hours) after assignment, potentially skipping intermediate steps.
	* **Implication:** Premature claim closures or non-standard process shortcuts.
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:
	* **Issue:** Unrealistically short transition time (5 minutes) between evaluation and notification.
	* **Implication:** Overly rapid transitions, potentially indicating skipped checks or automated bypasses.

**Hypotheses on Anomaly Existence**

* **Systemic Delays:** Manual data entry errors or system processing backlogs contributing to large time gaps (e.g., **P to N**).
* **Automated Shortcuts:** Overly aggressive automation leading to rapid, potentially unchecked transitions (e.g., **E to N**).
* **Resource Bottlenecks:** Inconsistent adjuster or resource availability causing irregular timing patterns (potentially contributing to **A to C** anomalies).
* **Process Non-Adherence:** Claims being processed outside standard protocols, either due to errors or intentional shortcuts (possibly affecting **R to P** and **A to C**).

**Verification Approaches using SQL Queries**

### 1. Identify Claims with Anomalous Time Intervals

```sql
-- Anomalies in Receive to Approve time
SELECT claim_id, TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='R' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P' AND claim_id=c.claim_id)) AS days_diff
FROM claims c
WHERE (SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='R' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P' AND claim_id=c.claim_id))) 
    < (SELECT AVG_TIME_IN_DAYS - 2*STDEV_TIME_IN_DAYS FROM temporal_profile WHERE ACTIVITY1='R' AND ACTIVITY2='P');

-- Long Approve to Notify Delays
SELECT claim_id, TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='N' AND claim_id=c.claim_id)) AS days_diff
FROM claims c
WHERE (SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='N' AND claim_id=c.claim_id))) 
    > (SELECT AVG_TIME_IN_DAYS + 2*STDEV_TIME_IN_DAYS FROM temporal_profile WHERE ACTIVITY1='P' AND ACTIVITY2='N');
```

### 2. Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters, Claim Types, or Resources

```sql
-- Adjuster Correlation with Quick Assign to Close
SELECT a.name, COUNT(c.claim_id) AS num_claims, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='A' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='C' AND claim_id=c.claim_id))) AS avg_hours
FROM adjusters a
JOIN claim_events ce ON a.adjuster_id = ce.resource
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity='A'
GROUP BY a.name
HAVING AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='A' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='C' AND claim_id=c.claim_id))) 
    < (SELECT AVG_TIME_IN_HOURS - 2*STDEV_TIME_IN_HOURS FROM temporal_profile WHERE ACTIVITY1='A' AND ACTIVITY2='C');

-- Claim Types with Excessive Approve to Notify Times
SELECT c.claim_type, COUNT(c.claim_id) AS num_claims, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='N' AND claim_id=c.claim_id))) AS avg_days
FROM claims c
WHERE (SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='N' AND claim_id=c.claim_id))) 
    > (SELECT AVG_TIME_IN_DAYS + 2*STDEV_TIME_IN_DAYS FROM temporal_profile WHERE ACTIVITY1='P' AND ACTIVITY2='N')
GROUP BY c.claim_type;
```

### 3. Filter by Specific Anomalous Patterns

```sql
-- Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment
SELECT c.claim_id, a.name AS adjuster_name, TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='A' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='C' AND claim_id=c.claim_id)) AS hours_diff
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id
WHERE ce.activity='A'
AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='A' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='C' AND claim_id=c.claim_id)) 
    < 2;  -- Assuming "immediately" as less than 2 hours for this context

-- Excessively Long Approval to Notification for Specific Customer Segments
SELECT c.customer_id, c.claim_type, TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='N' AND claim_id=c.claim_id)) AS days_diff
FROM claims c
WHERE c.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM customer_segments WHERE segment='high_value_customers')
AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P' AND claim_id=c.claim_id), 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity='N' AND claim_id=c.claim_id)) 
    > (SELECT AVG_TIME_IN_DAYS + 2*STDEV_TIME_IN_DAYS FROM temporal_profile WHERE ACTIVITY1='P' AND ACTIVITY2='N');
