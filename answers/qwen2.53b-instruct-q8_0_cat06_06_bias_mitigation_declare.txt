To address the requirements and mitigate potential bias within a loan application review process, we will add specific constraints to ensure fairness. Below is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with the new constraints:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "FinalDecision": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}

    # New constraints to mitigate bias
    "nonsuccession_coexistence_with_manualreview_for_decision_minority_check_race": {
        "CheckApplicantRace_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence_response_with_bias_mitigation_check_for_finaldecision": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck_Minority_With_ApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "FinalDecision_BiasMitigationCheck_Minority_With_ApplicantRace": {"precedence_support_with_bias_mitigation_check_for_finaldecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonsuccession_nonchainsuccession_after_applicant_race_disclosure_to_decisions_requiring_manualreview_check": {
        "FinalDecision_Minority_With_ApplicantRace": {"ManualReview_Minority_With_ApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "FinalDecision_Reject_Minority_With_ApplicantRace": {"nonsuccession_nonchainsuccession_after_applicant_race_disclosure_to_decisions_requiring_manualreview_check": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    }
}
```

### Rationale for New Constraints:

1. **`nonsuccession_coexistence_with_manualreview_for_decision_minority_check_race`:**
   - This constraint ensures that a `ManualReview` always coexists with any activity (`CheckApplicantRace_Minority`) that involves sensitive attributes (e.g., ApplicantRace: Minority). This guarantees fairness by requiring all potentially biased outcomes to have additional checks before being finalized.

2. **`precedence_response_with_bias_mitigation_check_for_finaldecision`:**
   - The `BiasMitigationCheck_Minority_With_ApplicantRace` ensures that any decision involving a sensitive attribute (e.g., `FinalDecision_Minority_With_ApplicantRace`) cannot occur immediately following an activity (`BiasMitigationCheck_Minority_With_ApplicantRace`). This prevents biased decisions from happening without proper checks, ensuring the sequence of activities adheres to fairness guidelines.

3. **`nonsuccession_nonchainsuccession_after_applicant_race_disclosure_to_decisions_requiring_manualreview_check`:**
   - The `FinalDecision_Reject_Minority_With_ApplicantRace` ensures that a rejection decision involving sensitive attributes (e.g., `ApplicantRace: Minority`) does not occur without proper manual review, which is required for fairness and consistency. This prevents direct succession from biased attribute checks to decision outcomes.

These added constraints ensure the process handles sensitive attributes thoughtfully, avoiding immediate biases in key decisions and requiring appropriate additional reviews or checks where necessary.
