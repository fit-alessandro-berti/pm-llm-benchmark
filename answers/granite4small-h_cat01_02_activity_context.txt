### Revised Event Log

To address the task, we need to analyze how each activity’s meaning evolves within a case and rename it accordingly. Here is the step-by-step analysis for each case:

#### **Case C001**

1. **Initiate Request**: This occurs only once in this case and indicates the start of the process via an online portal.
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Online Initiation`
   
2. **Verify Documents** (first occurrence): The agent is performing an initial check on identity documents submitted by the customer.
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Initial Document Verification`

3. **Call Customer** (first occurrence): This call occurs due to incomplete verification; it's a corrective action necessitated by missing information.
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Verification Call for Missing Info`

4. **Submit Additional**: The customer is providing additional documents requested in the previous step, which implies an adjustment or correction step based on earlier findings.
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Document Upload to Resolve Verification Issues`

5. **Verify Documents** (second occurrence): This verification happens after the document upload, indicating a reassessment post-correction.
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Reverification of Documents`

6. **Approve Request**: The final step indicates the completion and approval of the request after all verifications are successful.
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Final Approval`

#### **Case C002**

1. **Initiate Request**:
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Online Initiation` (Same context as in C001)

2. **Verify Documents**:
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Initial Document Verification` (Similar initial check as seen in C001)

3. **Call Customer**:
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Clarification Call for Account Discrepancy` 
     - Contextual clue: This call is to clarify an account discrepancy, which differs from the verification context.

4. **Adjust Account**:
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Internal Adjustment Based on Clarifications`
     - Contextual clue: Adjustments are made internally following a clarification call, indicating a proactive correction based on new information.

5. **Call Customer** (second occurrence):
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Follow-up Call for Confirmation of Adjustments`
     - This reflects the follow-up nature and purpose of confirming adjustments have been properly implemented.

6. **Approve Request**:
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Final Approval`

#### **Case C003**

1. **Initiate Request**:
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Branch Initiation` (This indicates initiation at a physical location, different from online)

2. **Verify Documents**:
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Physical Document Verification`
     - Contextual clue: Different environment and method compared to the web-based verification.

3. **Call Customer**:
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Return Call for Unattended Customer`
     - This clarifies that the call is specifically related to a customer who stepped out, unlike in other cases where it was due to missing information or clarification needs.

4. **Adjust Account**:
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Internal Correction Due to Missing Info`
     - Reflects adjustments made based on incomplete initial data.

5. **Verify Documents** (second occurrence):
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Reverification Post Internal Correction`
     - Contextual clue: This verification happens after an internal correction due to previously missing information, indicating reassessment post-correction.

6. **Approve Request**:
   - **Renamed Activity**: `Final Approval`

### Justification of Naming Choices

- **Online Initiation** vs. **Branch Initiation**: Differentiates between initiation channels (online portal vs. branch walk-in).
- **Initial Document Verification** and **Physical Document Verification**: Reflects the context in which verification occurs (digital/initial check vs. physical inspection at a branch).
- **Verification Call for Missing Info**, **Clarification Call for Account Discrepancy**, **Return Call for Unattended Customer**: Each name specifies the purpose of the call, providing clarity on why it was made.
- **Document Upload to Resolve Verification Issues** and **Internal Correction Due to Missing Info**: Highlights corrective actions taken in response to earlier steps or issues.
- **Reverification of Documents** and **Reverification Post Internal Correction**: Indicates reassessment activities following new information or corrections.
- **Final Approval**: Consistent across all cases, indicating the completion status uniformly.

The renamed activities provide clearer insights into their contextual roles within each case's process flow.
