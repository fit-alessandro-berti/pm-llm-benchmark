# Procure-to-Pay Event Log Analysis: Anomaly Detection

## Standard P2P Process Flow (Reference)

Before identifying anomalies, here's the expected sequence:

```
Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Purchase Requisition  Issue Purchase Order  
Receive Goods  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case
```

## Case-by-Case Analysis

###  Case 1001: NORMAL
| Sequence | Activity | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Create Purchase Requisition |  |
| 2 | Approve Purchase Requisition |  |
| 3 | Issue Purchase Order |  |
| 4 | Receive Goods |  |
| 5 | Vendor Invoice Received |  |
| 6 | Match Invoice to PO |  |
| 7 | Release Payment |  |
| 8 | Close Case |  |

**Assessment:** This case follows the standard P2P process correctly. No anomalies detected.

###  Case 1002: MULTIPLE SEVERE ANOMALIES

| Anomaly | Description | Risk |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **1. PO before Approval** | Purchase Order issued only 10 minutes after requisition, before approval | Bypasses authorization controls |
| **2. Payment before Approval** | Payment released before the requisition was even approved | Unauthorized expenditure |
| **3. Payment before Goods Receipt** | Payment released before confirming goods were received | Paying for goods never delivered |
| **4. Payment before Invoice Matching** | No 3-way match performed before payment | Potential overpayment or fraud |
| **5. Retroactive Approval** | Approval occurred after PO, invoice, and payment | Control is meaningless if retroactive |

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- **Fraud Risk:** This pattern is a classic indicator of procurement fraud, where someone could authorize payments to fictitious vendors
- **Financial Loss:** Paying without receiving goods exposes the organization to non-delivery
- **Compliance Violation:** Segregation of duties and approval workflows exist to prevent unauthorized spending
- **Audit Failure:** This case would be flagged in any internal/external audit

###  Case 1003: PAYMENT BEFORE VERIFICATION

| Anomaly | Description | Risk |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **1. Payment before Invoice** | Payment released before invoice was received | No documented basis for payment |
| **2. Payment before Goods Receipt** | Payment released 2 days before goods arrived | Prepayment without delivery assurance |
| **3. Payment before Matching** | Invoice matching done 3 days after payment | Verification is pointless after the fact |

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- **Cash Flow Risk:** Prepaying vendors without proper agreements creates financial exposure
- **No Leverage:** Once payment is released, the organization loses leverage if goods are defective or wrong
- **Reconciliation Issues:** Matching after payment defeats the control purpose (should catch discrepancies *before* paying)
- **Possible Collusion:** Could indicate employee-vendor collusion to accelerate payments

###  Case 1004: GOODS RECEIVED BEFORE PURCHASE ORDER

| Anomaly | Description | Risk |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **1. Goods before PO** | Goods received 15 minutes before PO was issued | "Maverick buying" - purchase made outside proper channels |

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- **Maverick Purchasing:** This indicates goods were ordered informally (phone, email) before proper documentation
- **Contractual Risk:** Without a PO, there's no agreed-upon price, terms, or conditions
- **Budget Control Failure:** Spending occurs without proper approval channels
- **Audit Trail Gap:** Retrospective PO creation ("after-the-fact PO") undermines procurement controls
- **Vendor Disputes:** May lead to pricing disputes without formal purchase agreement

## Summary of Findings

| Case | Severity | Key Issue |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1001 |  Normal | Standard process flow |
| 1002 |  Critical | Payment before approval, goods receipt, and matching |
| 1003 |  Critical | Payment before invoice, goods, and matching |
| 1004 |  Moderate | Goods received before PO issued |

## Recommendations

1. **Case 1002 & 1003:** Immediate investigation required - potential fraud indicators
2. **Case 1004:** Review purchasing compliance and enforce PO-first policy
3. **System Controls:** Implement hard stops preventing:
   - PO issuance without approval
   - Payment without completed 3-way match
   - Goods receipt without valid PO
4. **Training:** Reinforce proper P2P procedures with procurement and accounts payable teams
