### Analysis of Event Log and Violations

#### Normative Violations:

**Case 2:**
- **Violation:** Risk Assessment was performed before the Credit Check.
  - **Normative Constraint:** The process must start with receiving a loan application, followed by a credit check, then a risk assessment, and so on.
  - **Explanation:** This is a clear violation of the strict sequence rule where the credit check must precede the risk assessment.

**Case 2 (continued):**
- **Violation:** Finalize Documentation was attempted after a loan rejection.
  - **Normative Constraint:** If the loan is rejected, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation.
  - **Explanation:** This activity is not allowed according to the rules since it contradicts the decision logic for rejected cases.

#### Desiderata Violations:

**Case 3:**
- **Desideratum Violation:** Credit Check took more than 24 hours after the application was received.
  - **Desideratum:** Ideally, the credit check should be completed within a short time window (24 hours) after the application is received.
  - **Explanation:** This is a timing violation but not a serious issue as it is considered a desideratum.

**Case 3 (continued):**
- **Desideratum Violation:** Inform Applicant was done later than the recommended 48 hours after the loan decision.
  - **Desideratum:** Ideally, the applicant should be informed promptly (within 48 hours of the loan decision).
  - **Explanation:** This is another desideratum violation, indicating a delay in communication which is not critical but suboptimal.

**Case 3 (continued):**
- **Desideratum Violation:** No Follow-up Call was conducted before closing the case.
  - **Desideratum:** It is encouraged to perform a follow-up call before closing the case to ensure alignment, though it is not strictly required.
  - **Explanation:** This represents a missed opportunity for better process alignment but is not a severe violation.

### Conclusion:

- **Severe Violations:** Case 2 violates normative rules by performing risk assessment before credit check and attempting to finalize documentation after a rejection.
- **Suboptimal Behavior:** Case 3 fails to meet desiderata conditions with delayed credit checking, late notification, and the absence of a follow-up call, indicating less-than-ideal but not strictly incorrect process execution.

### Justification:

- **Normative Violations in Case 2:** These might occur due to human error or system glitches leading to activities being performed out of sequence.
- **Desiderata Violations in Case 3:** These delays could be due to workload pressures, system delays, or oversight, but they do not compromise the integrity of the process.

This analysis helps identify both critical rule breaches and areas for process improvement by highlighting deviations from best practices.
