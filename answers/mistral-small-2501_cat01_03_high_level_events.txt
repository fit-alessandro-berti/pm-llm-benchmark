### High-Level Process Steps and Justification

After examining the event log, the manufacturing process can be grouped into the following high-level activities:

1. **Material Preparation**
2. **Assembly**
3. **Quality Inspection**
4. **Post-Processing**

#### 1. Material Preparation

**Grouping Rule:**
   - Events that involve the initial handling and setup of raw materials are grouped under this step. This includes retrieving raw materials, scanning for identification, placing on the table, aligning, and preheating.

**Events Included:**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place metal sheet on table
   - Align metal sheet
   - Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
   - These activities are always performed at the beginning of the process for each case. They are sequential and preparatory, setting up the raw material for further processing.

**Example:**
   ```
   CaseID: A1
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet (Operator A)
   - Scan barcode (Operator A)
   - Place metal sheet on table (Operator A)
   - Align metal sheet (Robot Arm #2)
   - Preheat metal sheet (Heating Unit #1)
   ```

#### 2. Assembly

**Grouping Rule:**
   - Events involving the actual assembly of components, such as picking up tools and performing the welding process.

**Events Included:**
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
   - These events are focused on the physical construction of the product, often involving specific tools and the actual work of joining parts together.

**Example:**
   ```
   CaseID: A1
   - Pick up welding tool (Operator B)
   - Weld corner A (Operator B)
   - Weld corner B (Operator B)
   ```

#### 3. Quality Inspection

**Grouping Rule:**
   - Events that are used to ensure the quality and integrity of the assembled product. These typically involve measurements and checks by sensors or operators.

**Events Included:**
   - Measure weld integrity
   - Visual check

**Rationale:**
   - These activities are critical for ensuring that the product meets quality standards before moving to the next stage.

**Example:**
   ```
   CaseID: A1
   - Measure weld integrity (Quality Sensor #1)
   - Visual check (Operator C)
   ```

#### 4. Post-Processing

**Grouping Rule:**
   - Events that involve the final finishing steps after the main assembly and quality checks. This includes applying protective coatings and drying them.

**Events Included:**
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating

**Rationale:**
   - These steps are performed to protect the product and finalize it for use or further processing. They come after the main assembly and quality inspection stages.

**Example:**
   ```
   CaseID: A1
   - Apply protective coating (Coating Unit #3)
   - Dry coating (Heating Unit #2)
   ```

### Structured Representation of High-Level Activities

#### **Material Preparation**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place metal sheet on table
   - Align metal sheet
   - Preheat metal sheet

#### **Assembly**
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B

#### **Quality Inspection**
   - Measure weld integrity
   - Visual check

#### **Post-Processing**
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating

By grouping the events in this manner, we can better understand the high-level stages of the manufacturing process, making it easier to monitor, analyze, and optimize each phase. This structured approach allows for clearer communication and better process management.
