### Case Identification and Violation Analysis

Based on the normative process description and the event log, here is the identification of cases and the violations observed:

#### Case 1
- **Activities:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order  
- **Analysis:** This sequence perfectly follows the normative process. All activities are ordered correctly, with payment authorization occurring only after inventory check, and all subsequent steps follow sequentially.  
- **Conclusion:** No violations.

#### Case 2 (No Violation)
- **Activities:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
- **Analysis:** Although in this case, the authorization happens before packaging, the normative process does not explicitly prohibit this sequence. The text does state the authorization should come before packaging but does not insist on an immediate subsequent steps alignment like the case of Case 1. However, it’s the shortest sequence expected only if inventory insights dictate an immediate gap; it's marginally ambiguous but not outright violational given the phrasing and lack of direct conflict.  
- **Conclusion:** No clear violation, though the process leans on interpreting the strict necessity of 'Pay before Ship' as potentially allowing some flexibility in sequence but not here.

#### Case 3 (Violation)
- **Activities:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order  
- **Analysis:** 
  1. **Authorize payment before Inventory check**: The normative description specifies "Check inventory" must occur **before** payment authorization. Authorizing payment upon receipt (before inventory sufficiency is confirmed) is established as an ambiguity, but not explicitly forbidden in the text.
  2. **Proceed to Ship after Cancel**: In normal cases after inventory is insufficient, the process jumps immediately from inventory check to cancel order  Close order. However, in this sequence, after authorizing payment erroneously, the process proceeds directly to Ship order, which is incongruent with the normative flow that would logically skip from Pay to Ship directly afterward or at the very least not without final closure before a shipment attempt.
- **Conclusion:** This case violates two norms: the payment authorization should occur only after inventory confirmation (violated), and significant deviation occurred by skipping closure and shipping after cancellation without a checkout that acknowledges the order's invalid status—that closure and subsequent actions should ideally feature the order exit process regardless of payment error type or outcome mismatch.

#### Case 4 (No Violation)
- **Activities:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order  
- **Analysis:** This case correctly reflects the process for insufficient inventory, aligning well with the normative recommendations for handling unfulfillable orders.
- **Conclusion:** No violations.

#### Case 5 (No Violation)
- **Activities:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
- **Analysis:** The order is processed normally without any deviations from the stated process, just like Case 1. Authorization occurs after inventory check, but discounting the minor ambiguity discussed in Case 2, this is a standard and accepted flow given the context described.
- **Conclusion:** No violations.

### Summary of Violations
- **Case 3** is the only case violating the specified normative process. The prior incorrect authorization of payment without confirming inventory suffices as the primary violation, warranting a review of the protocol adherence during payment scrutiny. Additionally, the sequence post-cancellation actions ('Ship order' rather than 'Close order') further distances this case from a strict normative execution that aligns with standard process guidelines.
