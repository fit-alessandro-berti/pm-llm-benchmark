Here's an analysis of the provided temporal profile model, including identified anomalies, potential reasons for their existence, and SQL queries to verify these hypotheses.

**Anomalies Identified:**

1.  **R to P (Receive to Approve):**  Low standard deviation (1 hour) relative to the average time (~1.04 days).

2.  **P to N (Approve to Notify):**  Long average time (7 days) and high standard deviation (2 days).

3.  **A to C (Assign to Close):**  Relatively short average time (2 hours).

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** Very short average time (5 minutes).

**Hypotheses and Explanations:**

1.  **R to P Anomaly:**
    *   **Hypothesis:**  A subset of claims might be automatically approved based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., low claim amount, specific claim type), leading to consistently short processing times.  The remaining claims follow a more standard, longer approval process, but the auto-approved claims skew the standard deviation downwards.
    *   **Alternative Hypothesis:** There is a system error where approved events timestamps are not correctly inserted, artificially reducing time between Receive and Approve for some records.

2.  **P to N Anomaly:**
    *   **Hypothesis:**  Notification is handled in batches (e.g., weekly) rather than immediately after approval. This creates a cyclical pattern of delays.
    *   **Alternative Hypothesis:**  Resource constraints (e.g., insufficient staff, overloaded communication systems) cause delays in sending notifications.  The high standard deviation suggests inconsistent availability or prioritization.
    *   **Another Hypothesis:** There may be a manual review or secondary approval process that occurs after the 'P' event but before notification which is not captured in the current event logging.

3.  **A to C Anomaly:**
    *   **Hypothesis:**  Some claims are being closed prematurely, possibly due to errors, cancellations, or a fast-track process that bypasses the usual evaluation and approval steps.
    * **Alternative Hypothesis:** There may be a system error that double inserts the 'C' event timestamp, artificially reducing the duration.

4. **E to N Anomaly:**
    * **Hypothesis:** The evaluation step is cursory or automated, with immediate notification triggered, leading to skipping steps.
    * **Alternative Hypothesis:** The definition of 'Evaluate' might be inconsistent across different claim types or adjusters, meaning some 'Evaluate' actions represent a very quick confirmation, while other are more thorough investigations, and only the "quick confirm" is being captured.

**Verification with SQL Queries:**

**1. R to P Anomaly Verification:**

```sql
-- Query 1.1: Identify claims with short R to P times.
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    r.timestamp AS receive_time,
    p.timestamp AS approve_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS time_difference_seconds
FROM
    claim_events r
JOIN
    claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
JOIN
    claims c ON r.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE
    r.activity = 'R'
    AND p.activity = 'P'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) < (90000 - (2 * 3600)); -- Two STDEVs below average

-- Query 1.2: Check for correlation between claim type/amount and short R to P times.
SELECT
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp))) AS avg_time_difference_seconds
FROM
    claim_events r
JOIN
    claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
JOIN
    claims c ON r.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE
    r.activity = 'R'
    AND p.activity = 'P'
GROUP BY
    c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
ORDER BY
    avg_time_difference_seconds;

-- Query 1.3 Check claims approved by a potential automated user:
SELECT ce.*
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity = 'P'
and ce.resource = 'AUTO_APPROVER'; -- Assuming an automated process has a user named AUTO_APPROVER
```

**2. P to N Anomaly Verification:**

```sql
-- Query 2.1: Identify claims with long P to N times.
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    p.timestamp AS approve_time,
    n.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) AS time_difference_seconds
FROM
    claim_events p
JOIN
    claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN claims c on c.claim_id = p.claim_id
WHERE
    p.activity = 'P'
    AND n.activity = 'N'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > (604800 + (2 * 172800)); -- Two STDEVs above average

-- Query 2.2: Check for weekly patterns in notification times.
SELECT
    EXTRACT(DOW FROM n.timestamp) AS day_of_week,  -- 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday
    COUNT(*) AS notification_count
FROM
    claim_events n
WHERE
    n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY
    day_of_week
ORDER BY
    day_of_week;

-- Query 2.3 Check claims approved by a certain resources:
SELECT ce.*
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity = 'P'
and ce.resource in ('RESOURCE_1','RESOURCE_2'); -- Filter by a group of resources with high workload
```

**3. A to C Anomaly Verification:**

```sql
-- Query 3.1: Identify claims closed shortly after assignment.
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    a.timestamp AS assign_time,
    cl.timestamp AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cl.timestamp - a.timestamp)) AS time_difference_seconds

    a.activity = 'A'
    AND cl.activity = 'C'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cl.timestamp - a.timestamp)) < (7200 - (2 * 3600)); -- Two STDEVs below average

--Query 3.2 check missing intermediate events for prematurely closed cases

WHERE
    a.activity = 'A'
    AND cl.activity = 'C'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cl.timestamp - a.timestamp)) < (7200 - (2 * 3600)) -- Two STDEVs below average
	AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 from claim_events ce2 where ce2.claim_id = a.claim_id and ce2.activity in ('E','P'))
;

```

**4. E to N Anomaly Verification:**

```sql
-- Query 4.1: Identify claims notified quickly after evaluation.
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
	ce1.resource as evaluate_resource,
    ce2.resource as notify_resource,

	AND ce1.activity = 'E'
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < (300 - (2*60)); -- Two STDEVs below average

-- Query 4.2: Check for correlation between claim type and short E to N times.
SELECT
    c.claim_type,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp))) AS avg_time_difference_seconds
FROM
    claim_events e
JOIN
    claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN
    claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE

    AND n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY
    c.claim_type
ORDER BY
    avg_time_difference_seconds;
```

These queries aim to identify specific instances and patterns that deviate from the expected temporal profile, helping to confirm or refute the hypotheses about the anomalies. The results can pinpoint areas for process improvement, system debugging, or further investigation.
