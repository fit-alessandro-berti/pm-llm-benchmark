## Analysis of Temporal Profile Anomalies and Verification Hypotheses

### 1. Identified Temporal Profile Anomalies

| Activity Pair | Average Time (Seconds) | Standard Deviation (Seconds) | Observation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R to P** | 90,000 (~25 hours) | 3,600 (1 hour) | **Suspiciously Low STDEV:** The time from Receive to Approve is highly rigid (average 25 hours, variance only 1 hour). This suggests an artificial, potentially automated, fixed delay or scheduled batch processing, rather than a time reflecting variable human evaluation effort. |
| **A to C** | 7,200 (2 hours) | 3,600 (1 hour) | **Process Skipping:** A fast average closure (2 hours) immediately following Assignment, without mandatory intervening steps (E, P, N), suggests rapid, potentially improper, or mass closures for a significant subset of claims. |
| **E to N** | 300 (5 minutes) | 60 (1 minute) | **Unrealistically Fast Transition:** Five minutes between a potentially complex Evaluation and Customer Notification is too rapid for typical human review or final business rule checks, suggesting this step might be fully automated or bypassed. |
| **P to N** | 604,800 (7 days) | 172,800 (2 days) | **Extreme Bottleneck/Inconsistency:** Seven days is an exceptionally long delay between internal Approval and external Notification. The high standard deviation (2 days) indicates severe inconsistency; some notifications are likely delayed excessively, while others may be instantaneous. |

### 2. Hypotheses for Anomalies

| Anomaly | Potential Hypotheses |
|---|---|
| **R to P (Low STDEV)** | **Batch Processing/System Delay:** Approvals might not be continuous; instead, a daily automated batch job runs at a specific hour, creating a rigid timing structure unrelated to claim complexity. |
| | **Automatic Triage:** Simple claims might bypass human review entirely, leading to fixed-time system approval. |
| **A to C (Fast Closure)** | **Immediate Withdrawal/Low-Value Triage:** Claims that are quickly identified as fraudulent, duplicates, or withdrawn by the customer might be closed immediately after assignment without requiring formal evaluation or approval. |
| | **System Error/Data Corruption:** Claims are being marked as closed erroneously by an automated system triggered by the assignment event itself. |
| **E to N (Fast Transition)** | **Full Automation of Notification:** Once evaluation is complete, the notification step is entirely system-driven and instantaneous, with no intermediate manual quality check or review of the notification content. |
| | **Missing Intermediate Step:** A required review step (e.g., Quality Assurance check after Evaluation) is not being recorded in `claim_events`, causing the observed temporal gap to shrink artificially. |
| **P to N (Long Delay/High STDEV)**| **Resource Bottleneck:** The team responsible for sending final customer notifications (P to N) is severely backlogged or only works during specific limited hours/days (e.g., weekly mail-out schedule). |
| | **External Dependency:** Notification timing depends on an external factor (e.g., waiting for fund transfer confirmation or waiting for legal sign-off), which introduces highly variable delays. |

### 3. Verification Approaches using SQL Queries

To verify these hypotheses, we need to find the specific claims and attributes driving these timing anomalies.

#### Verification Query Set 1: Investigating Rigid R to P Timing (Hypothesis: Batch Processing)

**Goal:** Find claims where the R to P time is *exactly* 24 hours, or falls within the rigid 25-hour average window, and check if these fixed timings are linked to a specific resource or claim type.

```sql
WITH ActivityTimestamps AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS r_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('R', 'P')
    GROUP BY claim_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2
)
SELECT
    T1.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (T1.p_time - T1.r_time)) AS time_diff_seconds,
    C.claim_type,
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', T1.p_time) AS approval_hour
FROM ActivityTimestamps T1
JOIN claims C ON T1.claim_id = C.claim_id
-- Filter for claims that fall within the rigid window (24 to 26 hours)
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (T1.p_time - T1.r_time)) BETWEEN 86400 * 0.96 AND 90000 * 1.04
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds;
-- Analysis: If the 'approval_hour' tends to cluster (e.g., all 2 AM), it supports the batch processing hypothesis.
```

#### Verification Query Set 2: Investigating Fast A to C Closure (Hypothesis: Premature or Low-Value Closure)

**Goal:** Identify claims that went directly from Assign ('A') to Close ('C') in under 3 hours, and check if they lack the required intermediate steps ('E' or 'P') and correlate with claim attributes (type, amount).

```sql
WITH FastClosures AS (
    SELECT
        A.claim_id,
        A.timestamp AS assign_time,
        C.timestamp AS close_time,
        (C.timestamp - A.timestamp) AS duration
    FROM claim_events A
    JOIN claim_events C ON A.claim_id = C.claim_id
    WHERE A.activity = 'A' AND C.activity = 'C'
    -- Filter for closures happening within 3 hours (10800 seconds)
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (C.timestamp - A.timestamp)) <= 10800
)
SELECT
    FC.claim_id,
    FC.duration,
    CL.claim_type,
    CL.claim_amount,
    -- Check if Evaluation (E) or Approval (P) occurred for these fast claims
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events E WHERE E.claim_id = FC.claim_id AND E.activity IN ('E', 'P')) AS intermediate_steps_count
FROM FastClosures FC
JOIN claims CL ON FC.claim_id = CL.claim_id
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events E WHERE E.claim_id = FC.claim_id AND E.activity IN ('E', 'P')) = 0
ORDER BY CL.claim_amount DESC;
-- Analysis: If intermediate_steps_count is zero for many of these, and claim_amount is often low or zero, it confirms the premature closure hypothesis.
```

#### Verification Query Set 3: Investigating P to N Bottleneck (Hypothesis: Resource or External Delay)

**Goal:** Find claims where the P to N delay exceeds 10 days (significantly above the 7-day average + STDEV), and link these extreme outliers to the specific adjuster or region.

```sql
WITH SlowNotifications AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS n_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN resource END) AS initial_adjuster_id
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N', 'A')
    GROUP BY claim_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) >= 2 -- Ensure both P and N occurred
    AND MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
    AND MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
    SN.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM (SN.n_time - SN.p_time)) AS delay_days,
    A.name AS adjuster_name,
    A.region
FROM SlowNotifications SN
JOIN adjusters A ON CAST(SN.initial_adjuster_id AS INTEGER) = A.adjuster_id
-- Filter for extreme outliers (e.g., more than 10 days)
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (SN.n_time - SN.p_time)) > 86400 * 10
ORDER BY delay_days DESC;
-- Analysis: If delays cluster around specific adjusters or regions, it suggests a resource bottleneck or regional operational issue.
