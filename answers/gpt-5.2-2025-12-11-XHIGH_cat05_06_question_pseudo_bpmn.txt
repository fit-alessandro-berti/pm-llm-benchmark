1. How does the market research phase translate into specific, measurable design requirements for R&D, and what mechanisms ensure those requirements remain stable (or intentionally evolve) through the prototype stage?

2. What criteria determine when the smartphone prototype is “good enough” to trigger component sourcing, and how do you prevent costly downstream commitments if late-stage design changes occur?

3. Why is component procurement modeled as a parallel set of tasks—what dependencies or constraints still exist between suppliers (e.g., shared specs, lead times, or certification requirements) that might undermine true parallelism?

4. How do you evaluate the trade-off between best-in-class global suppliers and supply-chain resilience (e.g., dual sourcing, regionalization, or supplier diversification) for critical components like microprocessors and OLED screens?

5. What are the most likely failure modes in securing each component category (capacity shortfalls, geopolitical risk, quality drift, IP restrictions), and how is contingency planning embedded into the process rather than handled ad hoc?

6. How do you coordinate engineering change orders across multiple countries and suppliers without causing mismatched component revisions arriving at the Malaysia assembly plant?

7. What determines the choice of shipping components to a single assembly location (Malaysia) versus a multi-site assembly strategy, and how would you quantify the risk and cost impacts of each approach?

8. For a 24/7 assembly operation, what staffing, maintenance, and quality controls are necessary to avoid productivity gains being offset by defect rates, safety incidents, or downtime?

9. In the quality gateway, what diagnostic data is captured (and how quickly) to identify systemic issues, and how is that feedback loop used to improve upstream assembly processes and supplier quality?

10. How do you decide between “rework” and “scrap,” and what financial, environmental, and brand considerations influence that decision beyond immediate unit cost?

11. What is the rationale for packing and labeling after quality checks rather than earlier, and how do you handle localization needs (language, regulatory labels, bundled accessories) without introducing delays?

12. How do you decide which markets receive air freight versus sea freight—what variables (margin, demand volatility, launch timing, carbon targets, risk of stockouts) drive the routing logic?

13. Where are the biggest bottlenecks in customs clearance and regulatory compliance, and what proactive steps (pre-clearance, trusted trader programs, standardized documentation) could reduce variability?

14. How do you design the regional distribution network to balance speed, cost, and risk—what factors determine the number, location, and role of distribution centers across regions?

15. When distribution is split into warehousing, retailer supply, e-commerce fulfillment, and VIP/pre-orders, how do you prioritize allocations during constrained supply without damaging key relationships or customer trust?

16. What communication and governance model aligns stakeholders across R&D, procurement, logistics, compliance, sales, and customer service—especially when decisions must be made quickly under uncertainty?

17. Which performance metrics matter most at each stage (supplier OTIF, assembly yield, first-pass quality, customs lead time, fulfillment SLA, forecast accuracy), and how do you prevent metric optimization in one stage from harming the end-to-end outcome?

18. How is demand forecasting integrated with real-time sales and inventory signals, and what processes ensure forecasts drive action rather than becoming a reporting exercise?

19. At the “adjust orders to suppliers” decision point, what thresholds or triggers (confidence intervals, weeks of supply, lead-time risk) guide changes, and how do you avoid bullwhip effects?

20. If you could redesign this end-to-end process for higher resilience, what would you change first—supplier strategy, assembly footprint, logistics modes, compliance workflows, or inventory policy—and how would you validate the improvement before scaling it globally?
