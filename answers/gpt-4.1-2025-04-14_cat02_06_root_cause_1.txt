Let's proceed step by step as per your instructions:

## 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

**Calculate total resolution times:**
- The total resolution time is the interval from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket" for each case.

| Case ID | Receive Time           | Close Time               | Total Duration                    |
|---------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|**101**  |2024-03-01 08:00       |2024-03-01 10:15          | **2h 15m**                        |
|**102**  |2024-03-01 08:05       |2024-03-02 09:15          | **~25h 10m** (1 day, 1h 10m)      |
|**103**  |2024-03-01 08:10       |2024-03-01 09:30          | **1h 20m**                        |
|**104**  |2024-03-01 08:20       |2024-03-02 08:30          | **24h 10m** (1 day, 10m)          |
|**105**  |2024-03-01 08:25       |2024-03-03 09:30          | **~49h 5m** (2 days, 1h 5m)       |

**Benchmark/average:**  
- Cases 101 and 103 resolve within about 1–2 hours.
- Cases 102 and 104 take about a full day.
- Case 105 takes more than **two full days**.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Cases 102, 104, and 105** are **significantly longer** than 101 and 103.
- **Case 105** is the slowest, followed by **102** and **104**.

## 2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

Let's break down the potential delay points for the longer cases:

### **Case 102**

- **Escalation Present:**  
  Escalate to Level-2 Agent at 11:30. After escalation, the next "Investigate Issue" occurs at 14:00 (*2.5 hours gap after escalation*).
- **Biggest Delay:**  
  After "Investigate Issue" at 14:00, the "Resolve Ticket" does **not happen until 2024-03-02 09:00**—a gap of **19 hours** (overnight!).
- **Observation:**  
  Escalation adds at least one significant delay (waiting for a Level-2 agent), and the resolution step is deferred to the next day.

---

### **Case 104**

- **No Escalation**
- **Long delay before 'Investigate Issue':**  
  Triage at 09:00, Assign at 09:30, Investigate only starts at 13:00 (**3.5 hours later**).
- **Another long delay:**  
  After "Investigate Issue" at 13:00, "Resolve Ticket" occurs the next day at 08:00 (**19 hours later**).
- **Observation:**  
  Delay is caused by **waiting for investigation to start** and a long **wait before resolution** (possibly overnight or due to workload).

---

### **Case 105**

- **Two separate escalations/investigations:**
  - "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" at 10:00 (after Investigation at 09:10).
  - Another "Investigate Issue" by Level-2 at 14:00 **next day** (after escalation: **Day 1, 10:00  Day 2, 14:00** = **28 hours gap!**).
- **Long wait for resolution:**
  - "Resolve Ticket" at 09:00 the next day after Level-2 investigation (another **19 hours delay**?).
- **Observation:**  
  Multiple escalations & very long waits before Level-2 action.

---

## 3. **How These Factors Cause Delays & Recommendations**

### **Key Contributing Factors**

#### a. **Escalations (Level-2)**
- Escalations introduce very long delays (e.g., in cases 102 and 105).
- After escalation, tickets may wait a long time (possibly due to resource constraints, prioritization, or handovers).

#### b. **Waiting Time Before Investigation or Resolution**
- Long periods of inactivity between steps, especially before and after investigation or escalation.
- Likely reflect resource or shift constraints (tasks pushed to next business day), or delays in agent/Level-2 availability.

#### c. **Unnecessary Pauses / Lack of Parallelization**
- Gaps not explained by process but possibly by scheduling, workload, or missing SLAs for Step-to-Step handover.

### **Process Insights & Recommendations**

**1. Optimize Escalation Handling:**
- **Root cause:** Escalation to Level-2 causes largest delays.
- **Recommendation:** Review Level-2 availability and prioritization. Speed up hand-offs, set up alerts/SLAs for Level-2 response, or expand Level-2 staffing.

**2. Reduce Idle Times & Ensure Prompt Investigation:**
- **Root cause:** Long downtimes between assign/investigate/resolve.
- **Recommendation:** Institute automatic reminders or workflow triggers if a step is idle for more than a set duration (e.g., 1 hour).

**3. Analyze Shift Patterns and Handover Procedures:**
- **Root cause:** Overnight or shift-related delays (resolution postponed to next day).
- **Recommendation:** Provide after-hours coverage for critical steps, or flag high-priority tickets for end-of-day handling.

**4. Standardize Handover and Escalation Protocols:**
- **Root cause:** Unclear handover delays.
- **Recommendation:** Define clear SLAs for each stage (e.g., escalation must be picked up within 2 hours), monitor compliance.

**5. Prioritize Tickets Based on Age/Step:**
- **Root cause:** Tickets wait untriaged or uninestigated.
- **Recommendation:** Use ticket age/workflow step for queue prioritization.

### **Summary Table of Findings**

| Factor           | Cases Affected  | How it Causes Delay                   | Recommendation                                    |
|------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Level-2 Escalation | 102, 105      | Adds day(s) of waiting                | Reduce handoff time, staff Level-2 for coverage  |
| Waiting before Investigate | 104, 105 | Idle ticket before action             | Workflow triggers/reminders, queue management     |
| Overnight Gaps   | 102, 104, 105  | Next step waits until next day         | Extend coverage, escalate urgent tickets          |

---

## **Conclusion**

- **Escalation to Level-2 and long idle/waiting times** are the chief causes of long ticket resolution times in this sample.
- **Most dramatic delays** arise after escalation steps or when an activity is deferred overnight.
- **Actions:** Enhance escalation responsiveness, reduce idle time, and standardize SLAs for each workflow step. This can greatly improve average ticket resolution and avoid extended delays for customers.
