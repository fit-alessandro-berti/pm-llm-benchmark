The visualization is a flowchart representing a credit scoring process within a bank or credit service system. It includes two main sections:

1. **Top Section (Credit Scoring Process)**:
   - Initiates with a scoring request being received.
   - A request for the credit score is made.
   - It checks if a delay information is received. If so, it reports the delay.
   - If the credit score is received, it proceeds to send the credit score.
   - Ultimately, the scoring request is marked as handled.

2. **Bottom Section (Scoring Service Logic)**:
   - Also begins with a scoring request being received.
   - It computes the credit score at Level 1.
   - It checks if the score is available:
     - If yes, it sends the credit score.
     - If no, a delay is reported, and it then computes the score again at Level 2.
   - After any computations, the credit score is sent, concluding the scoring request.

Throughout the flow, there are branching decisions (represented by diamonds) and actions (rectangles) that guide the process based on whether information is available or if delays occur. The diagram visually illustrates how information is processed in response to credit score requests and the potential for delays in the scoring computations.
