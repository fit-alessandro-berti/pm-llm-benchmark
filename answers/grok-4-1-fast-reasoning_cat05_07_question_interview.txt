Here is a list of targeted, open-ended questions I would ask the interviewee to clarify and deepen my understanding of the property onboarding process. I've grouped them by process stage for logical flow, while also including questions on cross-cutting themes like exceptions, roles, and timing.

### Initial Contact and Documentation Review
1. Can you walk me through the typical timeline from when a landlord first contacts the regional office to when the property coordinator completes the documentation review and database entry?
2. What specific criteria does the property coordinator use to determine if documents like certificates of compliance or inspection reports are "outdated," and how often do landlords need to provide updates?
3. How does the property coordinator handle cases where documentation involves multiple units or properties across different cities?

### Property Manager Assignment
4. What are the key metrics or thresholds used to evaluate a property manager's "current workload" and "track record" during assignment, and how is geographic specialization weighted compared to experience with property types?
5. Who makes the final decision on property manager assignment—the coordinator, a regional supervisor, or someone else—and what input do landlords have at this stage?
6. How do you accommodate landlords with "unique requirements," such as custom lease clauses, when matching them to a property manager?

### Introductory Meeting and Preparation
7. What topics are typically covered in the introductory call or meeting between the property manager and landlord, and how are expectations documented afterward?
8. How does the property manager coordinate with external parties like photographers and inspectors, including how scheduling conflicts are resolved?

### Inspection, Repairs, and Marketing
9. When the inspector identifies issues, what factors influence whether the landlord or the company covers repair costs, and how long does this resolution typically take?
10. Can you describe the digital marketing team's process for updating "internal pricing models" based on market trends, including what data sources they rely on?
11. How are amenities and special conditions (e.g., pet policies) incorporated into marketing materials, and what role does the property manager play in approving them?

### Tenant Screening and Leasing
12. What are the most common challenges in tenant screening, such as handling multiple applications, and how does the property manager prioritize factors like lease length or promotional discounts?
13. How does the property manager verify tenant details like employment and references, and what red flags would lead to rejecting an otherwise strong applicant?
14. What steps are involved in finalizing the lease agreement, including how custom clauses requested by landlords are reviewed and integrated?

### Quality Checks, Activation, and Closeout
15. Who initiates the quality checks by the compliance officer, financial analyst, and IT department, and at what points in the process do these occur (e.g., before or after tenant move-in)?
16. How is the property officially "activated" in the rental portal and internal systems, and what happens if discrepancies are found during IT integration?

### Cross-Cutting Themes: Exceptions, Roles, Timing, and Communication
17. What are the most frequent exceptions or variations in this process—such as properties needing special insurance—and how are they escalated or resolved?
18. How do roles overlap or hand off between the property coordinator, property manager, leasing agents, and support teams, and what tools (beyond email, CRM, and project management software) facilitate this?
19. Can you describe how communication flows during delays or back-and-forth iterations, such as repeated documentation requests or repair negotiations?
20. Overall, what metrics or feedback mechanisms does the company use to measure the efficiency of the onboarding process and identify areas for improvement?
