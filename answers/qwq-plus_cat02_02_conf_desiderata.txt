Okay, I need to analyze the event log provided for the three cases and check against both the normative rules and the desiderata. Let me start with each case one by one.

Starting with Case 1. The first activity is Application Received on the 10th at 9 AM. The next step is Credit Check right after at 9:30, which followed by Risk Assessment at 10. Then Loan Decision (Approved) at 11 AM. Then Inform Applicant at 1 PM, then Finalize Documentation at 1:30 PM, and finally Close Case at 2 PM. Let me check if each step follows the sequence properly. The Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment, which they did. Risk Assessment before Loan Decision is correct. Loan Decision before Inform Applicant – yes. Since approved, they finalized documentation before closing the case. There's no violation here. All steps followed the correct sequence. So Case 1 seems to be compliant with all normative constraints.

Moving to Case 2. The Application Received is on the 11th at 8 AM. Then the next activity is Risk Assessment at 8:20, but wait, there's no Credit Check before Risk Assessment here. The normative rule says Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. So that's a clear violation. They did Risk Assessment before Credit Check, which is reversed. Then they did a Credit Check later, but after Risk Assessment. That violates the required order. 

Next, after the Loan Decision was rejected (9:30 AM), there's an activity "Finalize Documentation" at 10 AM, but per the rules, you shouldn't finalize docs after rejection. Then they Closed the case. So two normative violations here: first the reversed order of Credit Check and Risk Assessment, and second, finalizing docs after rejection. So Case 2 is definitely violating the normative rules.

Case 3 starts with Application Received on the 12th 9 AM. Then Credit Check happens at 10 AM on the 14th. Let me see the timestamp: two days later. The desiderata mentions Credit Check should be within 24 hours, but that's just a best practice. Since it's 48 hours later, that's a desideratum violation. So that's not a normative rule violation, but a recommendation. 

Continuing, Risk Assessment the same day as Credit Check (2024-01-14 11:00). Loan Decision (Approved) at 12 PM. Then they inform the applicant on the same day? Wait, the next activity is Inform Applicant on 1/16 at 3 PM. The loan decision was on the 14th, so that's two days later. The desiderata says inform within 48 hours. From the Loan Decision time is 14th at noon, so adding 48 hours would be by 16th at noon, but they informed at 3 PM, so that's just over 2 days, so maybe within 48 hours? Wait, the Loan Decision was at 12:00 PM on 1/14, adding 48 hours would bring us to 1/16 12:00 PM. The Inform Applicant is 1/16 3 PM, which is 2 days and 3 hours later. So that's outside the recommended 48 hours. That's a desideratum issue. 

Then, they finalize docs on the 17th at 9 AM. Since it was an approval, finalizing before closing is okay. Then Close Case the next hour. The absence of Follow-up Call is also a desideratum. So in normative rules, everything looks compliant for Case 3. The sequence is Application Credit Check (though late) Risk Decision (approved) InformFinalize Docs Close Case. So all steps in order, no skips. Except the Credit Check first, but they did it. They didn't skip steps, order is correct.

Now for the desiderata. Case 3: the Credit Check was over 24 hours later, Inform too slow, no follow-up call. Case 2 also has a desideratum? Well, for Case 2, maybe not since the main issue was normative. Let me check: no, the Credit Check in Case2 was done after the Risk Assessment, but the timing between Application and Credit Check was just 20 minutes, so that might be within 24 hours. So probably, Case 2's main issues are normative, but desiderata-wise, maybe no? But the reverse order is normative. 

So for part 2, the desiderata violations are: Case 2, the Risk Assessment before Credit Check is not a desideratum but a norm, so the main desiderata violators are Case1? No. Wait, in the event log for case 3, the follow-up call wasn't there, so that's part of desiderata. Case 1 didn't have a follow-up call either, but did they?

Looking at the table for case1: no line for follow-up. So what does the log say for case3? It just says "(No Follow-up Call)" indicating that there was none, but for case1 similarly, there's no entry listed. The log's Case3 line at the bottom has "(No Follow-up Call)" but the log table only lists up to Close Case. The Follow-up Call is a desideratum to do before closing. The question is whether the Follow-Up Call was performed. Since the log for Case1 shows the steps as per the log, maybe they didn't do a follow-up, hence it's a desideratum violation for both Case 1 and 3. The log explicitly notes for Case3 "No Follow-up Call", but the actual log table shows activities up to Close Case. So assuming all cases don't have a follow-up unless it's in the log. The 3rd case's line is separate because the log is in a table, but the note says "*(No Follow-up Call)*". Maybe the first two cases also lack it, but it's only explicitly noted for Case3. Wait, the problem description about Follow-up calls in Part2 says it's a desideratum to "sometimes" do it before closing. So in case1 and 3, they didn't have it, so both are violating desiderata. However, the user's event log adds a note next to Case3 about it, but not case1 or 2, but in the table itself, the follow-up is missing in all unless listed. Since it's a "recommended but not required", the absence isn't a violation of the normative.

For part 1, the violations are in Cases 2 (two violations) and Case3 has none (since its delays are just desiderata). Case1 is clean. 

Now, part2: For desiderata, all three cases?

Wait, let me check again:

Case1: The Credit Check was done immediately (within 24 hours, actually half an hour), so no issue. Inform applicant was 4 hours after Loan Decision (from 11 AM decision to 1 PM inform). Wait, the recommended is within 48 hours, which is much longer. Actually, the desiderata says "promptly within 48 hours". So Case1's inform is definitely within 48hr. The Follow up call wasn't done (since it's at the bottom of the log, but since it's not listed, maybe no follow-up). The note in the table says only for case3, but maybe the other cases also either did or didn't. The user might have only marked case3's absence because it's in the note, but maybe cases 1 and 2 didn't do it either. The problem states the follow-up is recommended, so if they didn't do it (missing in the logs), they are desideratum violations for all cases? Hmm.

Wait, in the event log table, case1's activities end at Close Case with no mention of follow-up, so maybe it was skipped. The same is Case2: the last step is Close Case. Only Case3 explicitly notes "(No Follow-up Call)" but others would have not mentioned it, implying the same. So technically, all three cases failed to do the Follow-up call, which is a desiderata. 

However, the problem example for case2 has a Note about No prior Credit Check and Finalize after rejection; case3 has the note about Credit Check after the 24h and the follow-up. Maybe the other cases didn't have violations except case2's normative.

To proceed step by step:

Part 1: Normative violations are in Case2 with two violations:

1. Performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check  violates ordering (Credit must before Risk).

2. Finalizing docs after rejection  which is explicitly prohibited. 

Any in Case3? Let's see: the sequence is correct: App  Credit (later, but still in order)  Risk  Decision (approved)  Inform  Finalize Docs  Close. So the sequence is followed. The Rejection in Case2 led to an error, but Case3 was an approval. Hence, Case3's steps are all correct. 

Therefore, only Case2 has normative violations. Case1 is compliant, case3 compliant except for desiderata.

Part 2: Desiderata issues:

Case1: Follow-up? Did they have a Follow-up? The log doesn't list it, so assuming they didn't, so that's a violation of desiderata. 

Wait, the desiderata says to do a Follow-up "sometime before closing the case". Case1's log ends with Close Case, so no follow-up activity recorded, so it's a desideratum. Also, in case2, did they do a follow up? No, because the log doesn't list any. But in case2, the final step is closing, so same as case1. Case3 is explicitly marked as no follow-up. Thus, all three cases: 1, 2,3 didn't have Follow-up call, so that's a Violation of desiderata. 

Then, for Case3's Credit Check: The application was on 1/12 at 9 AM, and the Credit Check was on 1/14 at 10 AM, which is two days (48 hours) later, thus exceeding the recommended 24 hours. That's another desideratum issue.

Additionally, Case3's Inform Applicant (Loan Decision was on 1/14 at 12:00 PM, inform on 1/16 at 3 PM) is more than 48 hours later? Let me compute the time: 

Loan Decision at 1/14 12:00 PM.

Adding 48 hours would be 1/16 12:00 PM. Inform was at 3 PM of 1/16, so that's 51 hours after, which exceeds 48, hence that's a desideratum violation.

Case2: Their Credit Check was at 8:20 AM the same day as application, so within 24h, and Inform started after the Loan Decision. The Loan Decision was at 9:30 AM, then inform is done next steps But the Loan Decision in case2 was at 9:30 AM, then they went to close, but close occurred after Finalize which they shouldn't have. Let me check: in case2, after loan decision (rejected at 9:30 AM on 1/11), the next steps were finalize, which is wrong. The Inform Applicant should come after the Loan Decision but before finalizing? Wait in the normative process, after Loan Decision, you inform applicant, then if approved finalize docs. Since it's rejected, you just close without. 

Wait in the log: case2 has after Loan Decision (Rejected)  Inform Applicant? Or not?

Looking at case2's log step by step:

After Loan Decision (Rejected) at 9:30 AM, the next steps are:

2024-01-11 10:00: Finalize Documentation (which is bad)

2024-01-11 10:30: Close Case.

Wait, are they missing Inform Applicant?

Wait, in the log table:

Case2 steps:

- 8:20 -> Risk Assessment (wrong)

- 9:00 -> Credit Check (out of order)

Then 9:30: Decision (rejected, but where is Inform Applicant?)

Are they missing the Inform step for case2? Let me check the log again for case2.

Case2 log entries:

After Loan Decision (9:30 AM), the next row is:

"2024-01-11 10:00 Finalize Documentation"  which is a violation (since rejected, shouldn't finalize).

Then "2024-01-11 10:30 Close Case".

Wait, when is the Inform Applicant done in case2? The steps don't include an Inform Applicant. That’s an issue.

Oh! This is a problem. Because, according to the normative sequence, after Loan Decision, you must inform applicant before closing, even if it's rejection.

Wait, the normative sequence is: after Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [approval  finalize docs]  Close case.

If rejected, the path would be: Loan Decision -> Inform -> Close (without docs). So informing applicant is a mandatory step here.

Therefore, in Case2, after the Loan Decision (9:30 AM rejection), there's a missing activity: "Inform Applicant". Instead, they went straight to finalizing (invalid) and then Closing. That's another normative violation.

So in Case2's log, the step after Loan Decision is Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed, but also skipping the Inform Applicant is a violation. 

Wait, the ordering rules require "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision". So you can't skip it. If in their steps, the order was:

Decision  Finalize  Close 

that skips inform, so that is a serious violation.

Looking again at Case2's log:

After Decision (at 9:30 AM, rejection), the next step is Finalize at 10 AM (wrong) and Close at 10:30.

So the Inform is not there. Therefore, Case2 has three normative issues:

1. Risk before Credit.

2. Finalizing after rejection.

3. Skipping the Inform step (noting that Info is missing entirely.)

Hence that’s three violations for Case2.

So I need to note all of that. Let me redo the case analyses considering that.

Case 2:

The steps:

App -> Risk (without Credit Check first) [violation1], then Credit Check (after Risk, which is allowed order-wise now?) Wait no, the Credit Check needs to be before Risk. So that first violation was sequencing.

Then the correct sequence after Credit Check is Risk (already done), then Loan Decision is performed. So Loan Decision (Rejected). Next, the inform is missing. The task sequence must include Inform after Decision, but instead they went to Finalize (wrong step). Thus, two issues: they skipped Inform and Finalized, and the finalize after rejection.

Also, missing informing the applicant is forbidden.

Hence, the violations for case2 are:

- Risk before Credit,

- Skipping the "Inform Applicant" step (mandatory),

- finalizing docs after rejection.

Therefore, normative violations here are multiple points.

Now for desiderata on case2: since the Credit Check after Application was on the same day (20 min later), that's within 24h. So no issue there. Inform Applicant wasn't done at all, so the desiderata about informing promptly is bypassed because it wasn't done, which is a bigger problem (normative), so the timing is not considered here.

Thus, summarizing:

Normative violations:

Case1: none.

Case2: multiple (out of order steps, missing inform, finalized wrong docs).

Case3: none, because sequence followed correctly.

Desiderata violations:

Case1: Failed to do Follow-up Call.

Case2: Not sure. They didn't do the follow-up either, so that's a desideratum. But they also had missing Inform which is normative. Follow-up is separate.

Case3: Follow-up missing, and Credit check delay, and inform delay.

Thus, the answers would be structured as:

1. Normative offenders: Case 2.

2. Desiderata offenders: Cases 1,2,3 (for follow-up), plus case3 for credit delay and inform delay, and case2 maybe not the latter things but the skipped inform is normative.

Wait in Desiderata part, the example includes Credit Check within 24 hours, so case3 needs to be named for that. Similarly, inform within 48 hours: case3 also, but case2 was done promptly but the inform wasn't done at all (so the desiderata applies only if inform is done).

Hmm, the desiderata for inform is to inform "within48 hours of the loan decision", regardless of approval or rejection. But in case2, the inform wasn't even performed, so the timing is not an issue (since it was skipped). But the problem states "the applicant must be informed" is a normative step. So for case2, the inform not done at all violates normative, so the desiderata timing applies only when it is done. So case3's inform took too long is a desideratum, and case2's missing inform is normative.

So for case2, desiderata: possibly missing follow-up call. So, the desiderata violations are:

- All three cases failed to do the optional follow-up calls.

- Case3 didn’t do Credit Check in 24h, inform  was delayed beyond 48h.

- Case2: maybe – if their Credit Check was done within 24h (which it was, since application was same day at 8am, and credit check at 8:20 the same day). So case2 is ok on that.

So part2 answer:

Desiderata violations are:

Case1: no follow-up call.

Case2: no follow-up call.

Case3: no follow-up, credit check took too long, and inform took too long.

Now, the third part is to suggest interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors.

For case2:

- The ordering violation (Risk before Credit) could have been an error in processing, maybe a mistake in workflow, like someone skipped a step. Alternatively, maybe a form wasn't properly filled during credit check so they did Risk first, but that doesn't justify the violation.

- Skipping the "Inform Applicant" step, which led to them skipping that, they went to finalize (incorrectly) – perhaps a system glitch or human error not following the process.

- The Finalizing after rejection was likely an oversight, a procedural mistake.

For case3: 

- The delay in Credit Check might be due to a backed-up Credit Bureau system that didn't process on time, or the application had incomplete info requiring follow-up, causing a delay beyond 24h.

- The delay in informing could be due to further review needed after the approval, or administrative backlogged tasks.

- No follow-up was just an option they chose to skip, perhaps understaffing or prioritizing other cases.

For case1, since all are good, no justification needed except they followed the process perfectly.

Thus, this is the thought process. Now compiling it into the required format.
</think>

### 1. Normative Rule Violations  
**Case 2** violates the following normative constraints:  

1. **Incorrect Order (Risk Assessment before Credit Check):**  
   - Case 2 starts with *Risk Assessment* at 08:20 on 2024-01-11, **before the Credit Check** occurs at 09:00.  
   - This violates the rule that **Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment**.  

2. **Missing **Inform Applicant** Activity:**  
   - After rejecting the loan at 09:30, the next step jumps directly to *Finalize Documentation* (at 10:00) and then *Close Case* (10:30).  
   - **Inform Applicant** is entirely skipped. This violates the requirement that applicants must be informed of the decision **before** any subsequent actions.  

3. **Finalizing Documentation After Rejection:**  
   - Despite being rejected, *Finalize Documentation* occurs before closing the case (as above). This violates the rule explicitly prohibiting this action.  

---

### 2. Desiderata Violations  
**Case 1:**  
- Failed to perform a **Follow-up Call** before closing the case.  

**Case 2:**  
- Failed to perform a **Follow-up Call** before closing the case.  

**Case 3:**  
- **Three violations:**  
  1. **Credit Check delayed beyond 24 hours:** The Credit Check happened 48 hours after the loan application (starting at 2024-01-12 09:00 and completed at 2024-01-14 10:00).  
  2. **Inform Applicant delayed beyond 48 hours:** The lender waited 51 hours after the Loan Decision (approved at 2024-01-14 12:00 to inform at 2024-01-16 15:00).  
  3. **Follow-up Call skipped.** All parties would benefit from alignment before closure.  

---

### 3. Interpretations/Justifications for the Behavioral Patterns  
#### Case 2:  
- **Possible Cause for Incorrect Sequence (Risk  Credit):** A staff member might have initiated Risk Assessment without confirming Credit Check completion in error. This could reflect user interface design flaws or lack of process training.  
- **Missing Inform Applicant:** Automating the loan decision may have triggered a premature rejection, skipping mandatory communication steps accidentally.  
- **Improper Finalization:** A rushed workflow or oversight after the erroneous rejection could have led to improper documentation steps.  

#### Case 3:  
- **Credit Check Delay:** A system outage or missing documentation in the application might have caused a holdup, delaying initial processing.  
- **Inform Applicant Delay:** Post-approval, manual verification steps or internal policy enforcements (e.g., verifying documentation validity) could have led to the delay in notification.  

#### General Notes:  
- **Follow-up Call Omission Across Cases:** The lack of follow-up calls is consistent with a process improvement opportunity. The absence may stem from understaffing or organizational prioritization, where non-mandatory steps are deprioritized for urgent completion.  
- **Case 1 Compliance:** Case 1 serves as a positive benchmark for adherence to strict rules, demonstrating a streamlined, error-free workflow.
