The diagram provided is a process map illustrating various workflows related to procurement and sales order processes. It includes multiple pathways starting from different initial items such as PurchaseRequisitionItem, SalesOrderItem, and PurchaseOrderItem. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Purchase Requisition Workflow (Purple Path)
1. **Start**
2. **Create Requisition** (Overall: 3.0M objects, 300ms)
3. **Approve Requisition** (Overall: 5.7M objects, 250ms)
   - This step branches into:
     - **Check Stock** (Overall: 1.0M objects, 320ms)
       - If stock is insufficient, it loops back to **Create Requisition** (400ms)
     - Directly to **Send Order** (Overall: 5.2M objects, 500ms)
4. **Send Order** (150ms to End)
5. **End**

Additionally, from **Approve Requisition**:
- **Process Return** (Overall: 0.8M objects, 600ms) leading to **End**

### Vendor Invoice Workflow (Teal Path)
1. **Start**
2. **Send Order** (Overall: 5.2M objects, 600ms)
3. **End**

### Return Order Workflow (Red Path)
1. **Start**
2. **Process Return** (Overall: 0.8M objects, 450ms)
3. **End**

### Sales Order Workflow (Orange Path)
1. **Start**
2. **Create Order** (Overall: 8.5M objects, 400ms)
3. **Pack Goods** (Overall: 2.0M objects, 300ms)
4. **Ship Goods** (Overall: 1.8M objects, 200ms)
5. **Confirm Delivery** (Overall: 1.7M objects, 22ms)
6. **Close Order** (Overall: 1.7M objects, 18ms)
7. **End**

Additionally, from **Create Order**:
- Directly to **Confirm Delivery** (300ms)

### Purchase Order Workflow (Blue Path)
1. **Start**
2. **Create Order** (350ms)
   - This branches into:
     - **Pack Goods** (300ms)
3. **Ship Goods**
4. **Confirm Delivery**
5. **Close Order** (100ms leading to End, and 700ms leading to another End)

### Key Points:
- Each process block includes the overall number of objects processed and the average time taken (in milliseconds) for transitions.
- The diagram uses color coding to differentiate between various workflows.
- The workflows show decision points and loops, such as checking stock and handling returns.

This visualization effectively maps out the lifecycle of procurement and sales orders, highlighting key steps, decision points, and transitions.
