Based on the provided attributes, here are the ones that could be considered sensitive in terms of fairness:

1. **Case Attributes**:
   - `case:gender`: The presence or absence of this attribute can indicate potential gender bias if certain outcomes (like job offers) disproportionately favor one gender.
     - Sensitive because it's related to demographic characteristics, which are often protected under anti-discrimination laws.

2. **Concept Name**: While all values could be considered relevant to the process being analyzed, some might carry more weight than others in terms of fairness:
   - `Hand In Job Application`: This could indicate initial bias if certain applications are disproportionately rejected or ignored.
   - `Application Rejected`, `Make Job Offer`: These outcomes can highlight potential biases if they favor certain groups over others.

3. **Resource**:
   - `resource`: The individuals involved in the process could introduce unfairness through their decisions. For instance, if one interviewer rejects more candidates of a particular gender or background, this might indicate bias.
     - Sensitive because it can reflect individual decision-makers' biases, leading to disparate outcomes for different groups.

4. **Temporal Attributes** (while not traditionally considered sensitive, they can be):
   - `start_timestamp`, `time`, `time:timestamp`: These could reveal temporal biases if certain outcomes are more likely at specific times or during certain periods.
     - Sensitive because they can show trends over time that may indicate changing patterns of bias.

5. **Other Attributes**: Although not explicitly listed, depending on the context and additional data available:
   - `case:religious`: If present, this attribute could be sensitive as it relates to religious beliefs and might be protected under anti-discrimination laws.
   - `age`, `ethnicity`, etc.: If these attributes are available and used in decision-making, they would also be sensitive.
