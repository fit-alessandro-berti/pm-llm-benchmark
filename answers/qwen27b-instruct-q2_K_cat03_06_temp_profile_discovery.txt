To provide a clear picture of the temporal profile for this process, let's organize it into understandable segments based on the descriptions provided:

### Process Overview

#### Core Steps:
##### Creation and Issuance (`Create Fine`)
- **Initialization**: The process begins with creating fines (`Create Fine`) typically associated with legal notices.

##### Notification Processes (`Send Appeal`, `Notify Result`)
- **Notification**: Following creation (`Create Fine`), actions like sending appeals (`Send Appeal`) involve additional notifications (`Notify Result`).

#### Execution Flow:
- **Primary Processing Path:** This is the main flow of processing events involving `Create Fine`, followed by `Send Appeal`, receiving results (`Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture`), then final steps (`Notify Result Appeal to Offender`, `Add Penalty`, etc.)
  
##### Additional Processing Flows:
  
  
  
  
#### Execution Metrics:

### Key Data Points for Visualization:

1. **Creation of Fines**: Counts the initial creation events (`Create Fine`). These are foundational events that start the fine lifecycle.

2. **Notification Events** (`Notify Result Appeal to Offender`): After processing steps (`Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture`, `Send for Credit Collection`), these represent notifications to individuals or entities receiving fines or notices.

3. **Completion Metrics**: Count of actions resulting in final stages (`Receive Result Appeal`, `Payment`) which mark completion or resolution of fine processes.

### Visualization Suggestions:

- **Timeline Graph**: This could depict events chronologically with time on one axis and event type on the other axis, illustrating transitions through different states (e.g., `Create Fine`, `Send Appeal`, `Notify Result`)
  
#### Explanation:
Each step in this process is critical:
```
1. A new fine (`Create Fine`) occurs initially.
2. An appeal is sent (`Send Appeal`).
3. The final result is received (`Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture`).
4. This leads to additional actions (`Notify Result`, `Add Penalty`, `Payment`, etc.)
``
This visualization would highlight the temporal dependencies between each step involved (`Send Appeal`, `Receive Result`, `Notify Result`, `Payment`) effectively showing how notifications are sent (`Notify Result`), and then results are processed (`Receive Result`). 

The system might also track additional flows such as:
```
1. A new fine (`Create Fine`)
2. The appeal is sent (`Send Appeal`)
3.`Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture`: Processing of the result
4.`Notify Result Appeal to Offender`: Notification related actions (`Add Penalty`, `Payment` etc.)
``
For completeness and detail:

- Each numbered step could be a node in the timeline graph.
  
### Technical Note:
Creating graphs based on such descriptions requires specific software tools like Gantt charts, BPMN diagrams (`Business Process Modeler`), or temporal profile tools where events can be marked chronologically with detailed actions annotated accordingly.

Let me know if you need assistance constructing said visualizations using any available online toolkits, platforms like Google Charts API for web-based solutions or specific diagramming software.
