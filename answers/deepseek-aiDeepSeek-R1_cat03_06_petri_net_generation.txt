Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to create an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim process described. First, I should break down the steps and understand the structure, including the loops for RDS and II.

The process starts with a customer filing a claim (C). Then the steps are CR, DV, FC, CA, possibly AP if needed, then P, N, CL. But after DV, there's a possible RDS loop. Similarly, after FC, there's a possible II loop. So those two steps need to have places where they can loop back.

Let's start by listing all transitions and their order. The main sequence is C  CR  DV  FC  CA  (AP if needed)  P  N  CL. But between DV and FC, there's a possible RDS loop. Between FC and CA, there's a possible II loop.

Wait, the problem says that after DV, if documents are incomplete, RDS occurs before continuing. So after DV, it could go to RDS and then back to DV, right? So DV's output place would lead to a decision: either proceed to FC or loop back via RDS. Similarly, after FC, if doubts are raised, II is done, and then possibly loop back to FC again. Or maybe the II is done and then back to FC?

So, for the DV to RDS loop: After DV, there's a place. From there, either go to RDS (which leads back to the place before DV) or proceed to the next step (FC). Wait, but how is DV structured? Let's model each activity as a transition. So between each transition, there's a place. For example:

Start with place P0. The initial transition is C (but wait, the initial marking is the start place. Wait, according to the scenario, the initial marking represents a new claim arriving, so the first transition is probably Claim Registration (CR). Wait, the problem says the steps start after the customer files the insurance claim. Wait no: the scenario says "A customer files an Insurance Claim (C)", then the steps take place. So maybe the initial place is after C? Or is C considered part of the process? The problem says that the initial marking is a new claim arriving, so perhaps the starting place is where the process begins, which is after the claim is filed. Wait, the example given in the prompt starts with a source place as the initial marking, and then transitions. So in the example, the source is connected to the execute_activity transition, which then goes to sink. So, in our case, the process starts with the initial marking having a token in the source place, which would then trigger the first transition (C or CR? Wait, step 1 is Claim Registration (CR) after the customer files the claim. So the initial marking should have a token in a start place, which leads to the CR transition. So the initial place is the start, connected to CR.

Wait, perhaps the customer filing the claim is the start event, but according to the problem statement, the steps after the customer files the claim are the ones to model. So the initial marking represents the claim having been filed and the process starting. So the first transition is CR (Claim Registration). So the source place (initial marking) connects to CR transition. Then after CR comes DV, then FC, etc.

Wait, the problem says, "the customer files an Insurance Claim (C), after which the following steps take place". So C is the trigger, but the actual process starts with CR. So maybe C is part of the process as the initial transition. Or perhaps not. Let me check the scenario again. The steps listed are after the claim is filed, so the process steps start with Claim Registration (CR). So perhaps the initial marking is a place that is the input to CR. So the source place (im has a token here) is connected to CR. Then after CR is completed, the token moves to a place which is the input to DV.

Now, the loops: after DV, if documents are incomplete, RDS occurs. So when DV is done, there's a place after it. From there, if RDS is needed, then the RDS transition would take the token from that place and put it back into the place before DV. Wait, no: if after DV, the next step is RDS (if needed), which would then lead back to the DV step. But how to model that. For example:

Let's model the flow as:

CR  DV  [ check if docs are complete ]

If incomplete: RDS  DV again.

If complete: proceed to FC.

So after DV, there is a place (let's say P1). From P1, there is a transition RDS which loops back to the place before DV. Wait, no. DV's output is P1. Then, P1 has two possible transitions: RDS (which would take the token from P1 and put it back to the input of DV), or the transition to FC (which would take the token from P1 and put it into the next place leading to FC).

Wait, the input to DV is the place after CR. So after CR, there's a place (let's call it P_CR). DV transition takes a token from P_CR, does DV, and outputs to P_DV (another place). Then, from P_DV, if RDS is needed, the RDS transition would take the token from P_DV and put it back to P_CR (so that DV can happen again). Otherwise, proceed to FC.

Wait, no. Because after DV is done, if RDS is needed, the customer has to resubmit documents, which would require going through DV again. So the RDS would lead back to the starting point of DV. Therefore, after DV, the output is a place (P_DV). From P_DV, there's a transition to RDS. The RDS transition would take a token from P_DV and output to the same place that was input to DV, which is P_CR. That way, after RDS, DV is done again. But that would require that RDS has an arc from P_DV to RDS, and an arc from RDS to P_CR. Then, from P_DV, another arc to the next transition, which is FC.

But how do we model the choice between proceeding or looping back? In Petri nets, transitions are enabled based on the availability of tokens. So after DV, if RDS is needed, then the RDS transition would fire, consuming the token from P_DV and putting it back into P_CR. If RDS is not needed, the token in P_DV would be used by the next transition (to FC), which would then proceed. So the transitions RDS and FC need to be in a free-choice scenario here. But Petri nets allow for that. However, in reality, the decision between RDS and proceeding would be based on some condition (like if documents are complete). Since Petri nets don't model conditions, but the control flow, we model the possible paths. So in the Petri net, both transitions (RDS and FC) would be possible from P_DV, and in the actual execution, only one of them is taken (based on the actual process flow, which could have a silent transition or an XOR split). But in the problem statement, the user just wants the structure, so we model the possible paths regardless of the decision logic.

So the structure would be:

CR  P_CR  DV  P_DV

From P_DV:

- RDS transition  P_CR (loop back to before DV)
- FC transition  next steps.

Similarly for FC and II. After FC, if an in-depth investigation is needed, it goes through II and loops back to FC. So after FC, place P_FC. From P_FC, transitions II (back to FC's input place) and the CA transition (proceeding to Claim Assessment).

So let's start building all these.

First, create the initial place (source) and the transitions for each activity.

Steps in order:

C (starting point? Or is the initial marking the start of CR? Wait, the initial marking should have a token in a start place representing a new claim arriving. The example code starts with a source place connected to the first transition. So in our case, the new claim arrives, the first activity is CR (Claim Registration). Therefore, the initial marking's source place is connected to CR transition.

So:

source  CR  P_CR  DV  P_DV  (RDS  P_CR or FC)

Then FC  P_FC  (II  FC's input place or CA)

Then CA  P_CA  (possibly AP  P_AP or skip AP)  P  N  CL  sink.

But the AP step is conditional. If the amount surpasses a threshold, then AP is needed. Otherwise, it can proceed directly to P. So after CA, when the token is in P_CA, there are two transitions: AP (if needed) and a direct transition to P. So maybe the structure is:

CA  P_CA  [AP or skip_AP]

AP  P_AP  P.

Or perhaps, after CA, the token is in a place that is input to both AP and a direct transition to P. Then AP and the direct transition are in an XOR split. Again, we model the possible paths.

So, after CA's output place (P_CA), transitions can be either AP (which then connects to a place P_AP) leading to P, or a direct transition (like a silent transition) that skips AP and goes to P. Wait, perhaps a silent transition (no label) that connects P_CA to the input place of P. But the problem says transitions are labeled with activity names. So maybe we need a transition for AP, and another transition for proceeding without approval (maybe labeled as something else?), but the scenario says that approval is required only if the amount is over a threshold. Since we can't model the condition, we just model the possible path.

In Petri net terms, the process after CA would branch into AP transition and another transition (maybe a 'skip approval' transition, but since it's not part of the scenario steps, perhaps a silent transition). But according to the problem statement, we need transitions labeled with activity names. So perhaps the AP is the only named transition here. Wait, the steps are:

5. Approval (AP): The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold.

So AP is conditional. If the threshold is surpassed, then AP is done; else, it's skipped. So in the Petri net, after CA, there's a place, then two transitions: AP (for when approval is needed) and a transition (maybe a silent one) for when approval isn't needed. However, the problem requires transitions labeled with the activity names. Therefore, the silent transition (which has no label) would be allowed. Because in the scenario, only certain steps are named activities, and the others are part of the process flow. Wait, but the problem says "transitions labeled with the activity names". So perhaps all transitions must be labeled with exactly the activity names given. So in this case, the transitions that are not part of the given activity names (like the steps to skip AP) would need to be silent transitions (i.e., transitions with no label).

So in code, we can create a transition for AP (labeled "Approval") and a silent transition (label None) that allows the process to proceed without approval. So in the Petri net, after CA, there's a place (P_CA) connected to both the AP transition and the silent transition. The silent transition connects to P's input place. AP's output would connect to a place (P_AP) which then connects to P transition.

So CA  P_CA. P_CA is input to AP and silent transition. AP  P_AP  P. Silent  P.

Then P  P_P  N  P_N  CL.

CL is the last step, leading to the sink place, which must be in the final marking. Wait, the example in the prompt deletes the sink. But in our problem, the final marking should be when the claim is closed (CL). So after CL, the token is placed in a sink place. Wait, the example code creates a sink place, adds it to the final marking, then removes the sink and deletes it from the final marking. But maybe we need to model the final marking as having a token in the place after CL. Let me think.

In the example, the initial marking has a token in 'source', and the final marking has a token in 'sink'. Then they delete the sink place and remove it from the final marking, perhaps that's a mistake. But for our problem, we need to create the initial and final markings. The initial marking is a token in the start place (source). The final marking is a token in a place that represents the process completion (sink). So after CL, the token goes to sink.

So the structure would be:

CL  sink. The final marking is {sink: 1}.

But in the example code, they later remove the sink and delete it from the final marking. But perhaps in our code, we should add the sink, and in the final marking, set sink to 1. Then if the example requires removing the sink, but in our case, perhaps keeping it. Wait, the example code shows that after creating the sink place and adding it to the final marking, they later remove the sink and delete it from the final marking. That's confusing. Let me check the example:

In the example, they create a source, sink, and transitions. Then add arcs. Then create im with source and fm with sink. Then remove the sink from the net and from fm. So why? Maybe that's an error in the example, but the user is supposed to use that approach. Hmm. Well, perhaps in their scenario, the code is an example, but in our problem, the code should create a sink place, which is part of the final marking. But the example's code seems to delete the sink from the net and the final marking. Maybe that's a specific way to structure the example, but perhaps we shouldn't do that. Because the final marking in our case should have a token in the sink place, which is added after the CL transition.

So, our steps:

- Create all places and transitions.

Start with source place, connected to CR.

After CR, P_CR (a place) connected to DV.

After DV, P_DV place. From there, transitions RDS (with arcs back to P_CR) and FC (proceed to FC).

Wait, no. If after DV, the RDS leads back to the input of DV, which is P_CR. So RDS transition would have an input arc from P_DV, and an output arc to P_CR.

Then from P_DV, FC's transition would take the token and proceed.

For FC, the place after FC is P_FC. From there, transitions II (looping back to the input of FC's transition) and CA (proceeding).

So II's input is P_FC and output is the same as FC's input place, which is after DV's FC transition. Wait, FC's input is the place after DV. So FC's input place is P_DV? No: the transitions between steps imply that each transition is followed by a place. Let's structure this:

CR is connected from source place. After CR, a place (P1). Then DV transition has input P1 and outputs to P2.

From P2, RDS transition (output to P1) and FC transition (output to P3).

FC's input is P3 (P2 is output of DV, and FC's input is P3? Wait, no. Let's re-examine.

Wait, the DV transition is followed by a place (P_DV), which is the output of DV. Then, from P_DV, there's either RDS or FC transition. So:

CR transition connects source  P_CR (place after CR)  DV. Then, DV's output is P_DV. From P_DV, RDS (output to P_CR) and FC (output to P_FC).

Wait, but if RDS outputs to P_CR, then after RDS, the token is back in P_CR, allowing DV to be executed again. That's correct.

Similarly for FC and II: FC's output is P_FC. From P_FC, II transition (output back to FC's input place, which is P_DV?), or CA transition. Wait, FC's input is from P_DV. So after FC's transition, the output is P_FC.

Wait, perhaps FC is part of the main flow. Let's outline all the transitions and their input/output places step by step.

Main flow:

source  CR  p_cr  DV  p_dv.

From p_dv:

- RDS  p_cr (loop back)
- FC  p_fc  next steps.

From p_fc:

- II  p_fc_input (the input to FC?)
Wait, FC's input is p_fc_input. So where is p_fc_input connected?

Hmm, maybe I need to re-express this.

Let me structure each activity as a transition with input and output places.

Activities in order:

1. CR (input: source, output: p1)
2. DV (input: p1, output: p2)
3. RDS (input: p2, output: p1)
4. FC (input: p2, output: p3)
5. II (input: p3, output: p3_input?) Not sure. Wait, II loops back to FC. So FC's input is p3, which is the output of FC's previous step (which is after FC transition).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.

After DV, the token is in p_dv. From here, the process can either:

a) go through RDS, which brings it back to p_cr (so DV can be executed again), or

b) proceed to FC, which would take the token from p_dv and output to p_fc.

Then, FC's output is p_fc. From p_fc, the process can either:

a) go through II, which brings the token back to the input of FC (which is p_dv), allowing FC to be executed again, or

b) proceed to CA, which then takes the token from p_fc and outputs to p_ca.

Wait, but FC's input place is p_dv, so II's output would need to put the token back into p_dv. But then, FC's transition would fire again. However, after FC transitions, the token is in p_fc. So for the II loop, after II, the token should go back into the input of FC (p_fc?), but no. Wait, perhaps FC's input is a place after FC's step.

No. Let me try to model this.

After DV is the place p_dv. FC's transition has input p_dv and output p_fc. From p_fc, the process can either proceed to CA, or go through II, which would loop back to p_dv (so that FC can be executed again). But then II's output is to p_dv, which is the input of FC. But FC's input is p_dv, so after II, the token is again in p_dv. Then FC would fire again. This would allow multiple FC and II loops.

Wait, that's possible. So after FC is done (token in p_fc), if II is needed, the II transition takes the token from p_fc and puts it back into p_dv. Then FC can fire again. But wait, FC's input is p_dv, which requires a token. So after II, the token is in p_dv, enabling FC again. So FC is executed again, leading to p_fc again. So the loop between FC and II is modeled by having II transition take the token from p_fc and put it back to p_dv. That way, FC can fire again. Then, each time FC fires, the process can decide to proceed to CA (from p_fc) or loop back via II.

But that would require that the II transition is connected from p_fc to p_dv. So the II transition's input is p_fc, and its output is p_dv. So II's output brings the token to p_dv again. Then, FC can fire again, which is correct.

So, FC's flow:

FC has input p_dv, output p_fc.

II transition has input p_fc and output p_dv.

Thus, the loop FC  II  FC is possible.

Similarly, RDS transition has input p_dv (since it's after DV), and output p_cr (which is the input to DV). So RDS brings the token back to the start of DV.

Wait, p_cr is after CR. So CR transition's output is p_cr, which is input to DV.

Yes. So RDS's output is p_cr, allowing DV to be triggered again.

So for the DV loop: RDS takes token from p_dv (output of DV), and puts it back into p_cr (input to DV). So when RDS fires, DV is executed again.

That's correct.

Now, moving to the CA step.

After FC's output (p_fc), the process can either go to II (looping back) or proceed to CA (transition from p_fc to p_ca). Then CA's output is p_ca.

From p_ca, the process checks if AP is required. So p_ca can go to AP transition (which requires approval) or a silent transition (no label) that skips AP.

AP's input is p_ca, output is p_ap. Then the AP transition leads to p_ap, which is input to Payment (P).

The silent transition (let's call it 'skip_AP') would take p_ca as input and output p_ap_skip (a place that leads to P). Wait, no. Alternatively, both AP and skip_AP transitions would take p_ca as input and output to the same place (p_p), which is the input to P. That way, regardless of whether AP is done or skipped, the process proceeds to P.

Wait, but perhaps AP's output is a place (p_ap) which connects to P, and the silent transition outputs directly to P's input place (p_p). So after CA, the two paths from p_ca are:

- AP  p_ap  P.

- skip_AP  p_p  P.

But then P would need to have two input places? Not possible. So perhaps the AP and skip_AP transitions both output to the same place. So whether AP is done or skipped, once approved or not, the process proceeds to P. That makes sense.

So:

p_ca  AP  p_p.

p_ca  skip_AP  p_p.

Thus, AP and skip_AP are two transitions, with input p_ca and output p_p.

AP is labeled "Approval", skip_AP is a silent transition (label None).

Then p_p is input to P transition.

After P, there's a place p_p_done, which leads to N (Notification).

N's output is p_n, which leads to CL (Closure). CL's output is sink place.

Thus, the final marking requires a token in the sink place.

Now, let's summarize all the components needed.

Places:

- source (initial place)
- p_cr (after CR)
- p_dv (after DV)
- p_fc (after FC)
- p_ca (after CA)
- p_ap (after AP, but not used since maybe we can connect directly to p_p)
Wait, no. AP transition outputs to p_ap. Alternatively, AP and skip_AP both output to p_p. So perhaps AP and skip_AP are two transitions with the same output place (p_p). So:

AP takes p_ca as input, outputs to p_p.

skip_AP takes p_ca as input, outputs to p_p.

Then P's input is p_p.

Transitions:

- CR (label: "Claim Registration")
- DV (label: "Document Verification")
- RDS (label: "Re-Document Submission")
- FC (label: "Fraud Check")
- II (label: "In-depth Investigation")
- CA (label: "Claim Assessment")
- AP (label: "Approval")
- skip_AP (silent transition, label=None)
- P (label: "Payment")
- N (label: "Notification")
- CL (label: "Closure")

Places:

source  CR  p_cr  DV  p_dv.

From p_dv, RDS  p_cr (loop back to DV), or FC  p_fc.

From p_fc, II  p_dv (loop back to FC), or CA  p_ca.

From p_ca, AP  p_p or skip_AP  p_p.

p_p  P  p_p_done.

p_p_done  N  p_n  CL  sink.

So the sink place is after CL.

Now, code-wise, each transition must be created, places must be added to the net, and arcs must connect them.

Let's start writing the code step by step.

First, import the required modules:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

Create the net:

net = PetriNet(name="Insurance_Claim_Process")

Create all places:

source = PetriNet.Place("source")
sink = PetriNet.Place("sink")
p_cr = PetriNet.Place("p_cr")  # after CR
p_dv = PetriNet.Place("p_dv")  # after DV
p_fc = PetriNet.Place("p_fc")  # after FC
p_ca = PetriNet.Place("p_ca")  # after CA
p_p = PetriNet.Place("p_p")    # after CA (AP or skip)
p_p_done = PetriNet.Place("p_p_done")  # after P
p_n = PetriNet.Place("p_n")    # after N

Add all places to the net:

net.places.add(source)
net.places.add(sink)
net.places.add(p_cr)
net.places.add(p_dv)
net.places.add(p_fc)
net.places.add(p_ca)
net.places.add(p_p)
net.places.add(p_p_done)
net.places.add(p_n)

Create all transitions:

cr = PetriNet.Transition(name="cr", label="Claim Registration")
dv = PetriNet.Transition(name="dv", label="Document Verification")
rds = PetriNet.Transition(name="rds", label="Re-Document Submission")
fc = PetriNet.Transition(name="fc", label="Fraud Check")
ii = PetriNet.Transition(name="ii", label="In-depth Investigation")
ca = PetriNet.Transition(name="ca", label="Claim Assessment")
ap = PetriNet.Transition(name="ap", label="Approval")
skip_ap = PetriNet.Transition(name="skip_ap", label=None)
p = PetriNet.Transition(name="p", label="Payment")
n = PetriNet.Transition(name="n", label="Notification")
cl = PetriNet.Transition(name="cl", label="Closure")

Add transitions to the net:

net.transitions.add(cr)
net.transitions.add(dv)
net.transitions.add(rds)
net.transitions.add(fc)
net.transitions.add(ii)
net.transitions.add(ca)
net.transitions.add(ap)
net.transitions.add(skip_ap)
net.transitions.add(p)
net.transitions.add(n)
net.transitions.add(cl)

Now, create the arcs.

From source to CR:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source, cr, net)

CR to p_cr:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr, p_cr, net)

p_cr to DV:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_cr, dv, net)

DV to p_dv:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, p_dv, net)

From p_dv:

To RDS and FC.

RDS transitions takes p_dv as input and outputs to p_cr.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_dv, rds, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds, p_cr, net)

FC takes p_dv as input and outputs to p_fc.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_dv, fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc, p_fc, net)

From p_fc:

To II and CA.

II takes p_fc as input and outputs to p_dv.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_fc, ii, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii, p_dv, net)

CA takes p_fc as input and outputs to p_ca.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_fc, ca, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca, p_ca, net)

From p_ca:

To AP and skip_ap.

AP takes p_ca as input and outputs to p_p.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_ca, ap, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap, p_p, net)

skip_ap takes p_ca as input and outputs to p_p.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_ca, skip_ap, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(skip_ap, p_p, net)

From p_p to P:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_p, p, net)

P outputs to p_p_done.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p, p_p_done, net)

p_p_done to N.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_p_done, n, net)

n to p_n.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n, p_n, net)

p_n to CL.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_n, cl, net)

CL to sink.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cl, sink, net)

Now, the initial marking is im = Marking() with source:1.

im = Marking()
im[source] = 1

Final marking is fm = Marking() with sink:1.

fm = Marking()
fm[sink] = 1

But wait, in the example code, after creating the initial and final markings, they delete the sink and remove it from fm. But in our case, that's not needed. So we should keep the sink place and the final marking.

Wait, looking back at the example code, they have:

# finally, remove the sink place

petri_utils.remove_place(net, sink)

del fm[sink]

But perhaps the example code has a mistake. However, in our problem, the final marking is when the claim is closed and archived, which is represented by the sink place. So our code should include the sink in the final marking.

Therefore, the initial and final markings are:

im = Marking()
im[source] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[sink] = 1

Putting this all together into code:

The code should create all the places, transitions, connect them with arcs, and set the initial and final markings.

Now, checking for possible mistakes:

- All transitions have the correct labels.

- The RDS transition correctly loops back to p_cr.

- The II transition correctly loops back to p_dv.

- The AP and skip_ap transitions both come from p_ca and output to p_p.

- CL's output is the sink place.

This seems correct.

Now, write the code with all these steps.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to model the insurance claim management process using an accepting Petri net. The goal is to represent the process flow, including possible loops for document re-submission and in-depth investigations, using transitions for each activity and places to denote the states between these activities. The initial and final markings represent the start and completion of the process, respectively.

### Approach
1. **Identify Activities and Their Order**: The main activities are Claim Registration (CR), Document Verification (DV), Fraud Check (FC), Claim Assessment (CA), Approval (AP), Payment (P), Notification (N), and Closure (CL). Additionally, Re-Document Submission (RDS) and In-depth Investigation (II) are conditional loops.
2. **Model Loops**: RDS can loop back to DV if documents are incomplete, and II can loop back to FC if further investigation is needed.
3. **Conditional Transitions**: After CA, the process can either proceed to AP (if the amount exceeds a threshold) or skip AP using a silent transition.
4. **Places and Transitions**: Each activity transition is connected by places. The initial marking starts at the source place, and the final marking is at the sink place after CL.

### Solution Code
```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create the Petri net
net = PetriNet(name="Insurance_Claim_Process")

# Create places
source = PetriNet.Place("source")
sink = PetriNet.Place("sink")
p_cr = PetriNet.Place("p_cr")
p_dv = PetriNet.Place("p_dv")
p_fc = PetriNet.Place("p_fc")
p_ca = PetriNet.Place("p_ca")
p_p = PetriNet.Place("p_p")
p_p_done = PetriNet.Place("p_p_done")

### Explanation
- **Places and Transitions**: Each activity in the process is modeled as a transition, with places connecting these transitions to represent the state changes.
- **Loops**: RDS and II transitions allow looping back to earlier stages if additional steps are required (e.g., document re-submission or further investigation).
- **Conditional Paths**: After Claim Assessment (CA), the process can either proceed to Approval (AP) if needed or bypass it using a silent transition.
- **Initial and Final Markings**: The process starts with a token in the source place and completes with a token in the sink place after Closure (CL).

This model accurately captures the insurance claim management process, including all specified activities and their potential loops, using a Petri net structure.
