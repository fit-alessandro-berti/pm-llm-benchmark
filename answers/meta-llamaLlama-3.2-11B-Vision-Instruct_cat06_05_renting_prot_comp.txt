Based on the process variants and their execution times, I've identified the main differences in the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups:

1. **Screening and Extensive Screening**: The protected group has more process variants that involve extensive screening (e.g., "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant") compared to the unprotected group. This suggests that the protected group may be subject to more rigorous screening processes, which could be contributing to the differences in treatment.

2. **Contract Signing and Tenancy Duration**: The unprotected group has more process variants that involve signing a contract and a longer tenancy duration (e.g., "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment"). This could indicate that the unprotected group is more likely to be approved for tenancy and have a longer tenancy duration.

3. **Eviction Process**: The protected group has a process variant that involves evicting a tenant ("Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant"), which is not present in the unprotected group. This suggests that the protected group may be more likely to be evicted.

4. **Time to Tenancy**: The unprotected group has more process variants that involve a shorter time to tenancy (e.g., "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant"). This could indicate that the unprotected group is more likely to be approved for tenancy in a shorter amount of time.

5. **Rent Payment History**: The unprotected group has more process variants that involve a longer rent payment history (e.g., "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment"). This could indicate that the unprotected group is more likely to have a longer rent payment
