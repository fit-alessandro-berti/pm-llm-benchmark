### **Merged Event Log**
**Format:** `timestamp, event_name, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes, origin`

```
2023-10-10T09:59:58Z,Order Received,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Event captured at warehouse system",Merged (Log B timestamp primary)
2023-10-10T10:01:29Z,Order Validated,Order#1234,u12,r10,"Cross-check inventory",Merged (Log B timestamp primary)
2023-10-10T10:02:05Z,Payment Processed,Order#1234,u12,r99,"Payment gateway delay",Merged (Log B timestamp primary)
2023-10-10T10:03:00Z,Quality Check,Order#1234,u45,r11,"Random inspection",From Log B
2023-10-10T10:05:02Z,Item Shipped,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Package handed to courier",Merged (Log B timestamp primary)
2023-10-10T10:20:00Z,Item Delivered,Order#1234,None,None,None,From Log A
```

### **Reasoning Behind the Integration**

#### **General Approach**
1. **Timestamp Matching Tolerance:** A 2-second threshold was used for aligning events, given slight discrepancies between System A and System B timestamps.
2. **Event Name Mapping:** Some events had different naming conventions (e.g., `Order Received` vs. `OrderReceived`). These were standardized during merging.
3. **Attribute Enrichment:** Attributes from both logs were preserved in merged records to create an enriched dataset.
4. **Non-Matching Events:** Events present in only one log were included as-is, with their origin explicitly noted.

#### **Detailed Mapping and Decisions**

1. **`Order Received` / `OrderReceived`:**  
   - **Log A Timestamp:** `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z`  
   - **Log B Timestamp:** `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z`  
   - **Match:** Yes, within the 2-second tolerance.  
   - **Primary Timestamp:** Log B (`2023-10-10T09:59:58Z`) was chosen because it likely represents the actual event timing rather than a delay from the receiving system.  
   - **Attributes:** Unified attributes from both logs.

2. **`Order Validated` / `OrderValidation`:**  
   - **Log A Timestamp:** `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z`  
   - **Log B Timestamp:** `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z`  
   - **Match:** Yes, within the 2-second tolerance.  
   - **Primary Timestamp:** Log B (`2023-10-10T10:01:29Z`) was selected as more precise.  
   - **Attributes:** Unified attributes from both logs.

3. **`Payment Processed` / `PaymentCheck`:**  
   - **Log A Timestamp:** `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z`  
   - **Log B Timestamp:** `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z`  
   - **Match:** Yes, within the 2-second tolerance.  
   - **Primary Timestamp:** Log B (`2023-10-10T10:02:05Z`) was used as it reflects the system's acknowledgment of a delay in processing.  
   - **Attributes:** Unified attributes from both logs.

4. **`Quality Check`:**  
   - **Log A Timestamp:** Not present.  
   - **Log B Timestamp:** `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z`  
   - **Match:** No corresponding event in Log A.  
   - **Inclusion:** Retained as-is from Log B with no attempt at merging.

5. **`Item Shipped` / `Shipping`:**  
   - **Log A Timestamp:** `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z`  
   - **Log B Timestamp:** `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z`  
   - **Match:** Yes, within the 2-second tolerance.  
   - **Primary Timestamp:** Log B (`2023-10-10T10:05:02Z`) was chosen as more precise.  
   - **Attributes:** Unified attributes from both logs.

6. **`Item Delivered`:**  
   - **Log A Timestamp:** `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z`  
   - **Log B Timestamp:** Not present.  
   - **Match:** No corresponding event in Log B.  
   - **Inclusion:** Retained as-is from Log A, explicitly marked as originating from there.

---

### **Key Considerations**
- **Timestamps:** Priority was given to Log B timestamps, as System B seemed to record events closer to real-time, while Log A likely reflected processed timestamps.
- **Event Naming Standardization:** Names were harmonized to use Log A conventions where possible (e.g., `Order Received` instead of `OrderReceived`) to ensure clarity.
- **Attribute Consolidation:** All available attributes (e.g., `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes`) were included in the merged records for enriched data representation.
- **Origin Tracking:** Each event's origin was clearly marked for transparency, especially for non-matching events.
