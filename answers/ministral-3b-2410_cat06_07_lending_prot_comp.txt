To identify the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, let's examine the process variants and their corresponding execution times.

### Main Differences:

1. **Loan Denial Frequencies**:
   - **Protected Group**: The protected group has a higher frequency of loan denials compared to the unprotected group.
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied` (frequency = 227)
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied` (frequency = 138)
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied` (frequency = 26)
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied` (frequency = 2709)
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied` (frequency = 335)
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied` (frequency = 297)
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied` (frequency = 80)

2. **Loan Approval Frequencies**:
   - The protected group shows a lesser frequency of loan approvals.
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement` (frequency = 39)
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement` (frequency = 31)
   - The unprotected group shows a higher frequency of loan approvals.
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement` (frequency = 183)
     - Process variant: `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement` (frequency = 188)

3. **Execution Times**:
   - **Protected Group**: Execution times for loan denials tend to be higher.
     - For example, `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied` (performance = 310015.991)
   - **Unprotected Group**: Execution times for loan approvals and loan denials are generally lower.
     - For example, `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement` (performance = 340004.889)

### Summary:

- The protected group has a significantly higher frequency of loan denials compared to the unprotected group.
- The protected group has a lesser frequency of loan approvals.
- The protected group tends to have higher execution times, particularly for loan denials.
- The unprotected group has more frequent loan approvals and lower execution times across the board.

The differences you've identified suggest that the protected group receives more stringent scrutiny and tends to face longer processes that result in more frequent denials, whereas the unprotected group experiences more approvals with shorter execution times. This discrepancy aligns with potential systemic biases or disparities in treatment based on the group's protected status.
