### High-Level Process Steps and Justifications

Based on the provided event log, the following high-level process steps have been identified. Each step is justified with an explanation of why the low-level events are grouped together.

1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Events Grouped:** Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet.
   - **Justification:** These events represent the necessary actions to prepare the raw metal sheet for the next stages (e.g., welding). The retrieval, scanning, and placing ensure the correct material is used, while alignment and preheating prepare the material for the assembly process.

2. **Assembly**
   - **Events Grouped:** Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B, Measure weld integrity.
   - **Justification:** These events describe the process of joining the parts together using welding. The tool retrieval and welding itself are part of the assembly process, and quality checks like measuring weld integrity ensure the parts are joined correctly.

3. **Coating and Drying**
   - **Events Grouped:** Apply protective coating, Dry coating.
   - **Justification:** Applying a protective coating and drying it are part of the finishing process. These steps protect the welded parts and make them ready for the next stage or for use.

4. **Quality Inspection**
   - **Events Grouped:** Visual check.
   - **Justification:** The visual check represents the final quality assurance step before the product is considered complete. This ensures that all quality standards are met and that no defects are present.
