<think>
We are going to model the insurance claim process as described.

Steps:
1. Claim Registration (CR)
2. Document Verification (DV) -> if incomplete, go to Re-Document Submission (RDS) and then back to DV
3. Fraud Check (FC) -> if doubts, go to In-depth Investigation (II) and then back to FC (multiple times)
4. Claim Assessment (CA)
5. Approval (AP) [only if amount surpasses threshold? but note: the description says "must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses", so we have a choice: if threshold not surpassed, skip AP? However, the problem does not specify a skip. But note: the description says "the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses", meaning that if it doesn't surpass, then no approval is needed. So we have a choice after CA: either go directly to Payment (if amount <= threshold) or go through AP (if amount > threshold). However, the problem does not specify how to model the condition. In Petri nets, we cannot model conditions directly without additional structure (like using a transition that has two outputs and a choice). But note: the problem does not specify that the amount is known at CA. We have to assume that after CA, the amount is known and then we decide.

However, note the problem says: "The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So we have two paths after CA.

But the problem does not specify the exact structure for the condition. We are to model the process as described. Since the problem says "in some cases" for RDS and II, we model loops for those, and for AP we have a choice.

However, the problem does not say that the approval step is conditional. It says "must be approved ... if ...". So we have two possibilities:

Option 1: After CA, we have a place that has two outgoing transitions: one for the case where the amount is above threshold (leading to AP) and one for below (bypassing AP). But note: the problem does not say that the adjuster knows the threshold? Actually, the adjuster decides the amount, so the amount is known at CA.

But in Petri nets, we cannot model a condition without having two separate transitions. So we will have:

- After CA, a place (let's call it "After_CA") that has two outgoing transitions:
T1: "Approval Needed" (label: "Approval") -> then to Payment
T2: "No Approval Needed" (label: None? but note: the problem says the activity is Approval only when needed) -> then to Payment

However, the problem states that the activity "Approval (AP)" is performed only when the amount surpasses. So we have to have a transition for AP only in that case.

But note: the problem says the process has the step "Approval (AP)" as one of the steps. So we must have a transition labeled "AP" that is enabled only when the amount is above threshold.

How to model the condition? We can use a place that represents the amount being above threshold? But that is not standard. Alternatively, we can have two separate paths.

However, the problem does not specify how the condition is decided. Since we are building a Petri net, we have to use the standard way: we have two transitions from the same place (the place after CA) that are mutually exclusive? But without a condition, the net would be non-deterministic. However, in reality, the condition is determined by the amount. But in a Petri net, we don't have data. So we model it as a choice (non-deterministic) but note: the problem says "if the amount surpasses", meaning that the token flow is determined by the amount. Since we cannot model data, we assume that the process model has two possible continuations and the actual path is determined by the amount (which is not modeled in the net). So we will model two transitions from the place after CA: one labeled "AP" and one unlabeled (or labeled as "Bypass Approval")? But the problem does not name the bypass.

However, the problem says: "the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold". So if the amount does not surpass, then the process goes directly to Payment. Therefore, we can have:

CA -> (place) -> [two transitions: one for AP and one direct to P]

But note: the problem lists the steps as 1 to 8, and step 5 is "Approval (AP)" which is conditional. So in the net, we will have a transition for AP only when the condition holds, and when it doesn't hold, we skip it.

However, the problem does not specify a separate activity for the bypass. So we can model:

After CA, we have a place that leads to two transitions:
T_AP: labeled "AP" (which then leads to Payment)
T_direct: unlabeled? but note: the next step is Payment. So we can have an unlabeled transition? But the problem says the activities are labeled.

Alternatively, we can have the Payment step as the next step regardless, but the AP step is inserted only when needed. So:

Place after CA: "CA_done"
Then, from "CA_done", we have two transitions:
T1: "AP" (label="Approval") -> leads to a place "After_AP", which then leads to Payment.
T2: "Skip_AP" (label=None? but we don't want to have an extra activity) -> leads directly to the place for Payment.

However, the problem says the activity names are the ones listed. So we don't have a "Skip_AP" activity. Therefore, we can have:

The Payment step (P) can be reached either from the Approval step (if done) or directly from the Claim Assessment step (if not done).

But note: the problem says step 6 is Payment (P). So the Payment step is always done. The Approval step is only done in some cases.

Therefore, we model:

CA -> (place) -> [two transitions: one to AP and one directly to P?]
However, that would mean that the Payment step is the same regardless of whether we went through AP or not.

But the problem does not specify that the Payment step is different. So:

Place after CA: "CA_done"
Then:
T_AP: "Approval" (label="AP") -> leads to a place "Approved", which then leads to Payment.
T_direct: unlabeled? but we don't want an extra activity. Alternatively, we can have the Payment step as a transition that is enabled from two places?

However, the standard way is to have the Payment step as a single transition that is enabled by two different places? But that would require two input places for the Payment transition. Alternatively, we can merge the two paths.

Let's design:

After CA, we have a place "After_CA".
From "After_CA", we have two transitions:
T1: "AP" (label="AP") -> leads to place "After_AP"
T2: "Direct_to_Payment" (but we don't want to name it) -> leads to place "After_CA_direct" (which is the same as "After_AP" in terms of next step?).

Then, we have a place that is the input for Payment: let's call it "Ready_for_Payment". We can have:
"After_AP" -> Ready_for_Payment
"After_CA_direct" -> Ready_for_Payment

Then Payment (P) is enabled from Ready_for_Payment.

But note: the problem says step 6 is Payment (P). So we have a single transition for Payment.

However, the problem does not specify that the Payment step is conditional. So we can merge the two paths into one place before Payment.

Alternatively, we can have the Payment transition have two input places: "After_AP" and "After_CA_direct". But in Petri nets, a transition can have multiple input places. So:

Payment (P) has two input places:
place1: "After_AP" (which comes from AP)
place2: "After_CA_direct" (which comes from the direct path)

But then, if both places have tokens, the Payment transition would be enabled twice? Actually, no: the transition would be enabled once for each token, but we don't want that. We want that only one token is present. So we must design so that only one path is taken.

How to enforce mutual exclusion? We can use a place that is the output of CA and the input for both the AP and the direct path. But then we have two transitions from the same place: one for AP and one for direct. This is a conflict (non-deterministic choice). However, in reality, the condition (amount) determines which one fires. But in the net, without data, it's non-deterministic. However, the problem says "if the amount surpasses", meaning that the condition is known. So we model it as a choice that is determined by the condition (which we don't model). Therefore, we have a non-deterministic choice? But in the context of process modeling, we often model such choices as exclusive OR (XOR) split.

However, the problem does not require the net to be deterministic. It just has to represent the possible paths.

So we model:

Place "After_CA" (with one token) has two outgoing transitions:
T_AP: labeled "AP" -> leads to "After_AP"
T_direct: we can label it as "No Approval Needed" but the problem doesn't name it. Alternatively, we can leave it unlabeled? But the problem says transitions are labeled with activity names. The activity names are only for the activities that occur. The direct path doesn't have an activity. So we can have an unlabeled transition? However, the problem says: "transitions labeled with the activity names". So for the direct path, there is no activity. Therefore, we can have an unlabeled transition? But note: the problem says "transitions labeled with the activity names", meaning that when an activity occurs, the transition is labeled with that activity name. For the direct path, no activity occurs, so the transition is unlabeled.

However, the problem does not explicitly say that every transition must be labeled. It says: "transitions labeled with the activity names". So we can have unlabeled transitions for the direct path? But that might be confusing.

Alternatively, we can avoid having a transition for the direct path by having the Payment step take input from two places: the place after AP and the place after CA (for the direct case). But then the Payment transition would have two input places: one from the AP branch and one from the CA branch. However, the CA branch would be the place "After_CA", but note: we have two transitions from "After_CA": one for AP and one for direct. The direct transition would go to a place that is an input to Payment? But then the token in "After_CA" is consumed by either AP or the direct transition.

Let me try:

After CA, we have a place "p1".
Then:
Transition AP (labeled "AP") has input p1 and output p2.
Transition T_direct (unlabeled) has input p1 and output p3.

Then Payment (P) has input places p2 and p3.

This is valid. The token in p1 will be consumed by either AP or T_direct, and then the Payment transition will be enabled by the token in p2 or p3.

But note: the problem says the Payment step is an activity. So the transition for Payment must be labeled "P". And it will fire when either p2 or p3 has a token.

However, the problem does not say that the Payment step is different based on the path. So this is acceptable.

But the problem says: step 6 is Payment (P). So we have one transition for Payment.

Now, for the loops:

Document Verification (DV) may lead to Re-Document Submission (RDS) and then back to DV. So:
DV -> (place) -> [if incomplete: RDS; if complete: next step]
But how to model the condition? Similarly, we have a choice: after DV, if documents are incomplete, we go to RDS; otherwise, we go to FC.

We model:
Place after DV: "After_DV"
Then two transitions:
T_RDS: labeled "RDS" (enabled when documents incomplete) -> leads to a place that goes back to DV
T_FC: labeled (nothing? but the next activity is FC) -> but note: the next activity is Fraud Check (FC). However, the problem says that after DV, if complete, we go to FC. So T_FC should be labeled as the activity that leads to FC? Actually, the activity FC is the next step. But note: the transition for FC is already defined. So we don't need a transition for the choice?

Actually, the activity FC is the next step. So the transition for FC should be enabled after DV (if the documents are complete) or after RDS (which then leads back to DV, and then eventually to FC when complete).

How to model the loop for DV and RDS?

We have:
DV (transition) -> place p_dv_done
From p_dv_done, two transitions:
T1: "RDS" (label="RDS") -> leads to a place that goes back to DV (so we need a place that feeds into DV)
T2: "To_FC" (unlabeled? but note: the next activity is FC, so we don't have an extra activity) -> leads to the place that enables FC.

However, the problem says that after DV, if incomplete, we do RDS and then go back to DV. So RDS is an activity that must be performed, and then the process returns to DV.

So:
p_dv_done -> T_RDS (labeled "RDS") -> p_rds_done
p_rds_done -> DV (so we add an arc from p_rds_done to the DV transition)

But note: the DV transition must be enabled again. So we need to have the token from p_rds_done go to the input place of DV? Actually, the input place of DV should be the same as the start of the loop?

Alternatively, we can have:

Start: ... -> DV
DV has output to a place p1.
p1 has two outgoing transitions:
T_RDS: labeled "RDS" -> leads to a place p2, and then p2 leads back to the input place of DV? But that would require an arc from p2 to the input place of DV. However, the input place of DV is the place that was the output of the previous step (CR). We don't want to go back to CR.

We need to design the loop so that after RDS, we go back to DV (without going through CR again). So:

We have a place "ready_for_DV" that is the input for DV.
Initially, after CR, we put a token in "ready_for_DV".
Then DV consumes that token and produces a token in "after_DV".
Then from "after_DV", we have:
T_RDS: labeled "RDS" -> leads to "after_RDS", and then we put a token back in "ready_for_DV" (so that DV can be fired again).
T_next: unlabeled? -> leads to the next step (FC).

So the loop is:
ready_for_DV -> DV -> after_DV -> [T_RDS -> after_RDS -> ready_for_DV] OR [T_next -> ...]

Similarly for FC and II:

After FC, we have a place "after_FC".
From "after_FC", two transitions:
T_II: labeled "II" -> leads to "after_II", and then back to a place "ready_for_FC" (which is the input place for FC).
T_CA: unlabeled? -> leads to CA.

But note: the problem says "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)."

So the loop for FC and II is similar.

Steps in order:

Start -> CR -> DV (with loop for RDS) -> FC (with loop for II) -> CA -> [AP or direct] -> P -> N -> CL

However, note: the problem says after DV, if documents are incomplete, we go to RDS and then back to DV. So the loop is around DV and RDS.

Similarly, the loop for FC and II: after FC, if doubts, go to II and then back to FC.

Now, let's list all the activities (transitions) and the places:

Activities (transitions with labels):
CR: Claim Registration
DV: Document Verification
RDS: Re-Document Submission
FC: Fraud Check
II: In-depth Investigation
CA: Claim Assessment
AP: Approval (only when needed)
P: Payment
N: Notification
CL: Closure

Additionally, we have two unlabeled transitions for the choices:
One after DV: to choose between RDS and going to FC.
One after FC: to choose between II and going to CA.
One after CA: to choose between AP and going directly to Payment.

But note: the problem says "transitions labeled with the activity names". The unlabeled transitions are not activities, so they are just routing. However, in Petri nets, every transition is an event. The unlabeled transitions represent the decision points (which are not activities). So we can leave them unlabeled.

Alternatively, we can avoid unlabeled transitions by having the next activity (FC, CA, P) be enabled directly from the choice? But that would require the activity transition to have multiple input places.

For example, for the DV loop:

Place after DV: p_dv
Then, we have two transitions:
T_RDS: labeled "RDS" -> leads to p_rds, and then p_rds leads to a place that is the input for DV (so that DV can be repeated).
T_FC: unlabeled? -> leads directly to the input place of FC.

But then, the FC transition would have two input places: one from the direct path of DV and one from the loop? Actually, no: the direct path of DV leads to the input place of FC.

However, the FC transition should be enabled only when the documents are verified and no re-submission is needed.

Similarly, for the FC loop:

Place after FC: p_fc
Then:
T_II: labeled "II" -> leads to p_ii, and then p_ii leads to the input place of FC (so FC can be repeated).
T_CA: unlabeled? -> leads to the input place of CA.

And for the CA branch:

Place after CA: p_ca
Then:
T_AP: labeled "AP" -> leads to p_ap, and then p_ap leads to the input place of Payment.
T_direct: unlabeled? -> leads directly to the input place of Payment.

However, note: the Payment transition would then have two input places: one from T_AP (via p_ap) and one from T_direct. But we can also have:

Instead of having T_direct go directly to the input place of Payment, we can have the Payment transition take input from two places: p_ap and p_ca_direct (where p_ca_direct is the place after T_direct). But then we have two places: p_ap and p_ca_direct.

Alternatively, we can have a single place "ready_for_P" that is fed by both T_AP and T_direct.

Let's design the entire net:

Places:

p_start: initial place (token here at start)
p_after_CR: after Claim Registration
p_ready_DV: ready for Document Verification (input to DV)
p_after_DV: after Document Verification
p_after_RDS: after Re-Document Submission
p_ready_FC: ready for Fraud Check (input to FC)
p_after_FC: after Fraud Check
p_after_II: after In-depth Investigation
p_ready_CA: ready for Claim Assessment (input to CA)
p_after_CA: after Claim Assessment
p_after_AP: after Approval
p_ready_P: ready for Payment
p_after_P: after Payment
p_after_N: after Notification
p_end: final place (for Closure)

Transitions:

CR: labeled "CR" -> from p_start to p_after_CR
Then, from p_after_CR to p_ready_DV (we can have a direct arc? or we need a transition? Actually, we can have an arc from p_after_CR to p_ready_DV without a transition? But that would merge the two steps. Instead, we have:

p_after_CR -> (arc) -> p_ready_DV

But note: in Petri nets, we can have an arc from a place to a place? No, arcs are between place and transition or transition and place.

So we need a transition? Actually, no: the step from after CR to ready for DV is immediate? But the problem doesn't specify an activity. So we can have:

p_after_CR -> (arc) -> p_ready_DV [but this is not allowed]

Instead, we have:

p_after_CR is the place after CR, and then we have an arc from p_after_CR to the DV transition? But DV is the next activity. So:

CR: p_start -> CR -> p_after_CR
Then, DV: p_after_CR -> DV -> p_after_DV ???

However, note: the input place for DV should be p_after_CR? But then after DV, we have p_after_DV.

But then, how do we model the loop? We need to have the token from RDS go back to the input of DV. So the input place of DV must be a place that can be refilled by the RDS loop.

Therefore, we split:

After CR, we have a place p1 (which is p_after_CR) that leads to a place p_ready_DV (via an unlabeled transition? or direct arc?).

Actually, we can have:

CR: p_start -> CR -> p1
Then, we have an arc from p1 to p_ready_DV? But again, no direct arc between places.

Instead, we can have:

p1 is the input place for DV. So:

CR: p_start -> CR -> p1
DV: p1 -> DV -> p_after_DV

Then, for the loop:

From p_after_DV, we have:
T_RDS: labeled "RDS" -> leads to p_after_RDS
T_next_DV: unlabeled -> leads to p_ready_FC

And then, from p_after_RDS, we have an arc to p1 (so that DV can be repeated).

This way, p1 is the input place for DV and also gets tokens from the RDS loop.

Similarly for FC:

p_ready_FC is the input place for FC? Actually, we can have:

T_next_DV: unlabeled -> leads to p2 (which is the input place for FC)

Then:
FC: p2 -> FC -> p_after_FC
From p_after_FC:
T_II: labeled "II" -> leads to p_after_II
T_next_FC: unlabeled -> leads to p_ready_CA
And from p_after_II: arc to p2 (so FC can be repeated)

And for CA:

p_ready_CA is the input place for CA? Actually, we have:

CA: p_ready_CA -> CA -> p_after_CA
From p_after_CA:
T_AP: labeled "AP" -> leads to p_after_AP
T_direct: unlabeled -> leads to p_ready_P
And then, from p_after_AP: arc to p_ready_P

Then Payment: p_ready_P -> P -> p_after_P
Then Notification: p_after_P -> N -> p_after_N
Then Closure: p_after_N -> CL -> p_end

However, note: the problem says step 7 is Notification (N) and step 8 is Closure (CL). So we have transitions for N and CL.

Now, the initial marking: token in p_start.
The final marking: token in p_end.

But note: the problem says the final marking should represent a closed claim. So we have a place p_end that has the token at the end.

However, the problem says: "the final marking is the final state of the Petri net". So we define fm as having a token in p_end.

But note: the problem also says: "the markings are dictionaries ... associate to a subset of places ... the corresponding number of tokens". So we only specify the places that have tokens.

Therefore, im: {p_start: 1}
fm: {p_end: 1}

Now, let's code accordingly.

Steps:

1. Create the Petri net.
2. Create all places and transitions.
3. Add arcs.

Places:

p_start = Place("p_start")
p_after_CR = Place("p_after_CR") # but note: we don't need an explicit place for after CR? because we have p1 (which is the input for DV) as the same as after CR? Actually, we have:

We can avoid having an extra place by having:

p_start -> CR -> p1

and p1 is the input for DV.

So we don't need a separate "p_after_CR", because p1 serves that purpose.

Let me define:

p0 = p_start
p1 = input for DV (and also the place after CR)
p2 = input for FC (and also the place after DV when going to FC)
p3 = input for CA (and also the place after FC when going to CA)
p4 = input for Payment (and also the place after AP or direct from CA)
p5 = after Payment
p6 = after Notification
p7 = p_end

Additionally, we need:

p_after_DV = place after DV (for the choice)
p_after_RDS = place after RDS (to go back to p1)
p_after_FC = place after FC (for the choice)
p_after_II = place after II (to go back to p2)
p_after_CA = place after CA (for the choice)
p_after_AP = place after AP (to go to p4)

So:

Places:

p0: start
p1: ready_DV
p2: ready_FC
p3: ready_CA
p4: ready_P
p5: after_P
p6: after_N
p7: end

p8: after_DV
p9: after_RDS
p10: after_FC
p11: after_II
p12: after_CA
p13: after_AP

Transitions:

CR: from p0 to p1
DV: from p1 to p8
RDS: from p8 to p9
T_next_DV: from p8 to p2 (unlabeled)
FC: from p2 to p10
II: from p10 to p11
T_next_FC: from p10 to p3 (unlabeled)
CA: from p3 to p12
AP: from p12 to p13
T_direct: from p12 to p4 (unlabeled)
P: from p4 to p5
N: from p5 to p6
CL: from p6 to p7

And the loop arcs:

from p9 to p1 (so RDS leads back to ready_DV)
from p11 to p2 (so II leads back to ready_FC)
from p13 to p4 (so AP leads to ready_P)

However, note: the loop for DV: after RDS, we go back to p1 (ready_DV). Similarly for FC.

But wait: the transition T_next_DV goes from p8 (after_DV) to p2 (ready_FC). And RDS goes from p8 to p9, and then p9 to p1.

Similarly, T_next_FC goes from p10 (after_FC) to p3 (ready_CA), and II goes from p10 to p11, and then p11 to p2.

And for the CA branch: AP goes from p12 to p13, and then p13 to p4; T_direct goes from p12 to p4.

Now, the unlabeled transitions: T_next_DV, T_next_FC, T_direct.

The problem says: "transitions labeled with the activity names". The activities are CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL. The other transitions (T_next_DV, T_next_FC, T_direct) are not activities, so they are unlabeled.

In pm4py, a transition without a label is created by setting label=None.

Steps in code:

1. Create the net.
2. Create all places (with unique names).
3. Create all transitions (with labels for the activities, and None for the unlabeled ones).
4. Add arcs.

Note: The example code uses:

source = PetriNet.Place(name="source")
net.places.add(source)

Similarly for transitions.

We'll create:

places = {
'p0': Place("p0"),
'p1': Place("p1"),
'p2': Place("p2"),
'p3': Place("p3"),
'p4': Place("p4"),
'p5': Place("p5"),
'p6': Place("p6"),
'p7': Place("p7"),
'p8': Place("p8"),
'p9': Place("p9"),
'p10': Place("p10"),
'p11': Place("p11"),
'p12': Place("p12"),
'p13': Place("p13")
}

transitions = {
'CR': Transition("CR", label="CR"),
'DV': Transition("DV", label="DV"),
'RDS': Transition("RDS", label="RDS"),
'T_next_DV': Transition("T_next_DV", label=None),
'FC': Transition("FC", label="FC"),
'II': Transition("II", label="II"),
'T_next_FC': Transition("T_next_FC", label=None),
'CA': Transition("CA", label="CA"),
'AP': Transition("AP", label="AP"),
'T_direct': Transition("T_direct", label=None),
'P': Transition("P", label="P"),
'N': Transition("N", label="N"),
'CL': Transition("CL", label="CL")
}

Then add arcs:

CR: p0 -> CR -> p1
DV: p1 -> DV -> p8
RDS: p8 -> RDS -> p9
T_next_DV: p8 -> T_next_DV -> p2
FC: p2 -> FC -> p10
II: p10 -> II -> p11
T_next_FC: p10 -> T_next_FC -> p3
CA: p3 -> CA -> p12
AP: p12 -> AP -> p13
T_direct: p12 -> T_direct -> p4
P: p4 -> P -> p5
N: p5 -> N -> p6
CL: p6 -> CL -> p7

Loop arcs:
p9 -> p1 (so from p9 to DV? but note: DV is a transition, so we need an arc from p9 to the transition DV? Actually, no: we have an arc from p9 to p1? But p1 is a place. We want the token to go to p1 (which is the input place for DV). So we add an arc from p9 to p1? But that would be a place to place? Not allowed.

Correction: we have to go through a transition? But the loop is immediate: after RDS, we are ready for DV again. So we can have an arc from p9 to the input of DV? But the input of DV is the place p1. However, in Petri nets, we cannot have an arc from a place to a place. We must have a transition in between? But there is no activity. So we can have an unlabeled transition? But we already have T_next_DV for the other branch. However, for the loop, we don't want an extra transition? Actually, we can have an arc from p9 directly to p1? No, that's not allowed.

How to model the loop without an extra transition? We can have the RDS transition output to p1? But then:

RDS: p8 -> RDS -> p1

Then, from p1, we have DV: p1 -> DV -> p8.

This would create a loop: p1 -> DV -> p8 -> RDS -> p1.

But note: the problem says after DV, if incomplete, we go to RDS and then back to DV. So:

DV produces a token in p8.
Then RDS consumes p8 and produces a token in p1 (so that DV can be repeated).

However, what about the direct path? We also have T_next_DV that consumes p8 and produces p2.

So:

p8 has two outgoing transitions: RDS and T_next_DV.

This is acceptable.

Similarly for the FC loop:

II: p10 -> II -> p2 (so that FC can be repeated)

And for the CA branch:

AP: p12 -> AP -> p4? But wait, we have:

We want AP to lead to p4 (ready for Payment) and T_direct also leads to p4.

So:

AP: p12 -> AP -> p4
T_direct: p12 -> T_direct -> p4

However, note: the problem says that after AP, we go to Payment. So we don't need an intermediate place for after_AP? But we have p13 in our initial design. Now we are removing p13.

Alternatively, we can have:

AP: p12 -> AP -> p4 (so p4 is ready for Payment)

But then, what if we want to model the after_AP state? It's not necessary because the next step is Payment. So we can skip the intermediate place.

However, the problem does not specify any state between AP and Payment. So we can go directly.

Similarly, for the direct path: T_direct goes from p12 to p4.

So we don't need p13.

Therefore, we can simplify:

Remove p13.

Then, the transitions:

AP: from p12 to p4
T_direct: from p12 to p4

But note: if both transitions fire, they would both put a token in p4? But only one token is in p12, so only one of them can fire.

Now, the loop for DV:

We have:
RDS: from p8 to p1 (so p1 is the input for DV)

Similarly, for FC:

II: from p10 to p2 (so p2 is the input for FC)

So the places we need:

p0: start
p1: ready_DV (input for DV)
p2: ready_FC (input for FC)
p3: ready_CA (input for CA)
p4: ready_P (input for Payment)
p5: after_P
p6: after_N
p7: end

p8: after_DV
p10: after_FC
p12: after_CA

And the other places (p9, p11, p13) are removed.

Now, the transitions:

CR: p0 -> p1
DV: p1 -> p8
RDS: p8 -> p1 (loop back to DV)
T_next_DV: p8 -> p2 (to FC)
FC: p2 -> p10
II: p10 -> p2 (loop back to FC)
T_next_FC: p10 -> p3 (to CA)
CA: p3 -> p12
AP: p12 -> p4
T_direct: p12 -> p4
P: p4 -> p5
N: p5 -> p6
CL: p6 -> p7

This is simpler.

Let me check the flow:

Start: p0 has token.
CR: consumes p0, produces p1 -> now p1 has token.
DV: consumes p1, produces p8 -> now p8 has token.

Then, two choices at p8:
Option 1: RDS -> consumes p8, produces p1 -> then DV can be repeated.
Option 2: T_next_DV -> consumes p8, produces p2.

If Option 2:
FC: consumes p2, produces p10.
Then at p10:
Option A: II -> consumes p10, produces p2 -> then FC repeated.
Option B: T_next_FC -> consumes p10, produces p3.

If Option B:
CA: consumes p3, produces p12.
Then at p12:
Option X: AP -> consumes p12, produces p4.
Option Y: T_direct -> consumes p12, produces p4.

Then P: consumes p4, produces p5.
N: consumes p5, produces p6.
CL: consumes p6, produces p7.

This matches.

Now, the unlabeled transitions: T_next_DV, T_next_FC, T_direct.

We'll create them with label=None.

Code structure:

net = PetriNet("Insurance Claim Process")

# Create places
p0 = PetriNet.Place("p0")

net.places.add(p10)
net.places.add(p12)

# Create transitions
CR = PetriNet.Transition("CR", label="CR")

# Add arcs

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p10, T_next_FC, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p6, CL, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CL, p7, net)

# Initial marking: token in p0
im = Marking()
im[p0] = 1

# Final marking: token in p7
fm = Marking()
fm[p7] = 1

However, note: the problem says the initial marking should place a token in a start place (which is p0) and the final marking in the end place (p7).

But note: the example code uses:

im = Marking()
im[source] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[sink] = 1

So we do the same.

Let's write the code accordingly.

Important: The problem says "Provide the Python code for constructing the Petri net"

We'll write the code as described.

Note: We are using the class `pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj.PetriNet`, `Marking`, and `petri_utils`.

We assume the necessary imports.

Code:
</think>

To model the insurance claim management process as an accepting Petri net, I've designed a structure that captures all specified activities, including loops for document re-submission and fraud investigation, as well as conditional approval. The solution uses places to represent states between activities and transitions labeled with activity names. Unlabeled transitions handle routing decisions (e.g., loops and conditional paths).

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Document Verification Loop**: 
   - After `DV`, if documents are incomplete, `RDS` executes and loops back to `DV` (via place `p1`).
   - If documents are complete, routing transition `T_next_DV` moves to `FC`.
2. **Fraud Check Loop**: 
   - After `FC`, if doubts exist, `II` executes and loops back to `FC` (via place `p2`).
   - If no doubts, routing transition `T_next_FC` moves to `CA`.
3. **Conditional Approval**: 
   - After `CA`, if amount exceeds threshold, `AP` executes before `P`.
   - If amount is below threshold, routing transition `T_direct` skips `AP` and moves directly to `P`.
4. **Final Steps**: 
   - `P` → `N` → `CL` forms the linear sequence to closure.

### Python Code:
```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create the Petri net
net = PetriNet("Insurance Claim Process")

# Define places (states between activities)
p0 = PetriNet.Place("p0")  # Start place
p1 = PetriNet.Place("p1")  # Ready for Document Verification (DV)
p2 = PetriNet.Place("p2")  # Ready for Fraud Check (FC)
p3 = PetriNet.Place("p3")  # Ready for Claim Assessment (CA)
p4 = PetriNet.Place("p4")  # Ready for Payment (P)
p5 = PetriNet.Place("p5")  # After Payment
p6 = PetriNet.Place("p6")  # After Notification
p7 = PetriNet.Place("p7")  # End place (Closure)
p8 = PetriNet.Place("p8")  # After Document Verification (DV)
p10 = PetriNet.Place("p10") # After Fraud Check (FC)
p12 = PetriNet.Place("p12") # After Claim Assessment (CA)

# Add places to the net
net.places.update([p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p10, p12])

CA = PetriNet.Transition("CA", label="CA")          # Claim Assessment
AP = PetriNet.Transition("AP", label="AP")          # Approval
T_direct = PetriNet.Transition("T_direct", label=None)    # Routing after CA (skip AP)
P = PetriNet.Transition("P", label="P")             # Payment
N = PetriNet.Transition("N", label="N")             # Notification
CL = PetriNet.Transition("CL", label="CL")          # Closure

# Add transitions to the net
net.transitions.update([CR, DV, RDS, T_next_DV, FC, II, T_next_FC, CA, AP, T_direct, P, N, CL])

# Payment → Notification → Closure
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p4, P, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(P, p5, net)

# Initial marking: token in start place (p0)
im = Marking()
im[p0] = 1

# Final marking: token in end place (p7)
fm = Marking()
fm[p7] = 1
```

### Explanation:
- **Places**: Represent states (e.g., `p1` = ready for DV, `p8` = after DV). The initial marking starts at `p0`, and the final marking ends at `p7`.
- **Transitions**: 
  - Labeled transitions (e.g., `CR`, `DV`, `RDS`) correspond to business activities.
  - Unlabeled transitions (`T_next_DV`, `T_next_FC`, `T_direct`) handle routing decisions without additional activities.
- **Loops**: 
  - `RDS` feeds back to `p1` (DV input) for document re-submission.
  - `II` feeds back to `p2` (FC input) for repeated fraud investigation.
- **Conditional Path**: After `CA`, tokens go to `p4` (Payment) either via `AP` (if amount > threshold) or directly via `T_direct` (if amount ≤ threshold).
- **Final Sequence**: Payment (`P`) → Notification (`N`) → Closure (`CL`) ensures the claim ends in `p7`.

This model accurately reflects the insurance claim process, including all specified loops and conditional paths, while adhering to Petri net semantics using `pm4py`. The initial and final markings correctly represent the start and end states of a claim.
