Event abstraction can significantly improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs by reducing noise and increasing the focus on important aspects of the process. Here are some ways event abstraction can be effectively utilized:

1. Grouping similar events: By aggregating events that share common attributes or have similar impacts on the process, the complexity of the process model can be reduced. This can be achieved by defining abstraction hierarchies or using clustering techniques.
2. Identifying critical events: By focusing on the events that have the most significant impact on the process, you can create a more concise model that highlights the essential aspects of the process. This can be done by analyzing event frequencies, durations, or correlations.
3. Hiding irrelevant details: By abstracting away non-essential details, you can simplify the process model and make it easier to understand. This can be done by removing events that have little impact on the process or by aggregating events that occur frequently but do not contribute significantly to the overall process.
4. Using concise labels: By using clear and concise labels for abstracted events, you can improve the readability of the process model. Labels should be descriptive, easy to understand, and consistent across the model.
5. Preserving the process flow: When abstracting events, it is essential to preserve the underlying process flow. This can be achieved by ensuring that the order of events is maintained and that any dependencies between events are preserved.
6. Validating the abstracted model: Before using the abstracted process model, it is essential to validate it against the original event log. This can be done by comparing the behavior of the abstracted model to the behavior of the original model and ensuring that any essential aspects of the process are accurately represented.
