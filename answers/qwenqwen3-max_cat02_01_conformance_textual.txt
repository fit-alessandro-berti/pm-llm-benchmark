Based on the normative process description and the provided event log, we analyze each case to determine whether it adheres to the expected process flow. The key constraints derived from the normative description are:

### Core Rules (Explicit or Strongly Implied):
1. **"Receive order" must be the first activity.**
2. **"Check inventory" must immediately follow "Receive order" and must occur before any other activity (especially before "Authorize payment", "Package items", "Ship order", or "Cancel order").**
3. **If inventory is sufficient:**
   - The sequence must be:  
     **Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order**
   - **"Authorize payment" must precede "Package items"**
   - **"Package items" must precede "Ship order"**
4. **If inventory is insufficient:**
   - The sequence must be:  
     **Receive  Check  Cancel order  Close order**
   - **No fulfillment activities ("Authorize payment", "Package items", "Ship order") should occur after "Cancel order"**
   - **"Cancel order" must directly follow "Check inventory" (i.e., no intermediate fulfillment steps)**
5. **"Close order" must be the final activity in all cases.**
6. **"Ship order" must never occur after "Cancel order" or without prior "Package items".**
7. **"Authorize payment" should only occur in the sufficient-inventory path and must happen after "Check inventory" and before "Package items".**

Now, evaluate each case:

---

### **Case 1**
**Sequence**:  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close

 **Compliant**  
- Follows the sufficient-inventory path exactly as described.
- All ordering constraints are satisfied.

---

### **Case 2**
**Sequence**:  
Receive  Check  **Package  Authorize**  Ship  Close

 **Violation**  
- **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"**, which violates the rule that payment must be authorized before packaging.
- The normative description states:  
  > “Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment… ‘Package items’ should only occur after authorization…”
- This is a clear sequencing violation.

---

### **Case 3**
**Sequence**:  
Receive  Check  Authorize  **Cancel**  **Ship**  Close

 **Multiple Violations**  
1. **Cancellation after payment authorization**:  
   - The normative process specifies that **if inventory is insufficient**, the path is **Check  Cancel** directly.
   - Authorizing payment implies inventory was sufficient, so cancellation should not follow.
   - Conversely, if inventory was insufficient, payment should **not** have been authorized.
   - Thus, **"Authorize payment" and "Cancel order" are mutually exclusive**—they should not both appear in the same case.

2. **Shipping after cancellation**:  
   - The description explicitly states:  
     > “It would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping) [after cancellation].”
   - "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order", which is a direct violation.

---

### **Case 4**
**Sequence**:  
Receive  Check  Cancel  Close

 **Compliant**  
- Matches the insufficient-inventory path exactly.
- No fulfillment activities after cancellation.
- Proper closure.

---

### **Case 5**
**Sequence**:  
Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship**  Close  
(**Missing "Package items"**)

 **Violation**  
- **"Ship order" occurs without "Package items"**.
- The normative description states:  
  > “Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as ‘Package items.’ Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with ‘Ship order.’”
- Thus, **"Package items" is a required step between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order"** in the sufficient-inventory path.
- Skipping packaging violates the required sequence.

---

### Summary of Violating Cases:
- **Case 2**: Packages before authorizing payment.
- **Case 3**: Authorizes payment then cancels; ships after cancellation.
- **Case 5**: Ships without packaging items.

### Compliant Cases:
- **Case 1**: Full correct fulfillment path.
- **Case 4**: Correct cancellation path.

---

### Final Answer:

**Violating Cases**: 2, 3, and 5.

**Explanations**:
- **Case 2** violates the rule that payment must be authorized **before** packaging items.
- **Case 3** violates multiple rules: it both authorizes payment and cancels the order (which are mutually exclusive paths), and it ships the order after cancellation—contrary to the prohibition on fulfillment activities post-cancellation.
- **Case 5** skips the mandatory "Package items" step before shipping, violating the requirement that items must be packaged prior to shipment in the fulfillment path.
