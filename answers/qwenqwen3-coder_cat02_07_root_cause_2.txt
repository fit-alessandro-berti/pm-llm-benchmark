To analyze performance issues in the insurance claims process, we will:

1. **Calculate the total duration of each case** (from *Submit Claim* to *Close Claim*).
2. **Identify outliers** with significantly longer durations.
3. **Analyze correlations** between these long durations and attributes: **Resource**, **Region**, and **Complexity**.
4. **Deduce root causes** based on the data.
5. **Propose mitigation strategies**.

###  Step 1: Calculate Case Durations

We compute the total duration for each case from submission to closure:

| Case ID | Start (Submit Claim) | End (Close Claim)      | Duration         |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30       | **1h 30m**       |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00       | **1 day 1h 55m** |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30       | **2 days 15m**   |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45       | **1h 25m**       |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30       | **3 days 5h 5m** |

Cases **2003** and **2005** clearly stand out with durations significantly longer than others.

###  Step 2: Analyze Attributes of Long Cases

We now compare the attributes of the long cases (2003 and 2005) versus the short ones (2001 and 2004):

| Case ID | Complexity | Region | Resource (Eval/Appr)     | # of Doc Requests |
|---------|------------|--------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| 2001    | Low        | A      | Adjuster_Mike / Manager_Ann | 0                 |
| 2002    | Medium     | B      | Adjuster_Lisa / Manager_Ann | 1                 |
| 2003    | High       | A      | Adjuster_Mike / Manager_Bill| 2                 |
| 2004    | Low        | B      | Adjuster_Lisa / Manager_Ann | 0                 |
| 2005    | High       | B      | Adjuster_Lisa / Manager_Bill| 3                 |

#### Key Observations:

- **Complexity**: Cases with **High** complexity (2003 and 2005) involve **multiple document requests**, adding significant delays.
- **Resource**: Both long cases are handled by:
  - **Adjuster_Lisa** (Case 2005) and
  - **Adjuster_Mike** (Case 2003),
  - who issue multiple document requests.
- **Region**: Both high-duration cases span **multiple days**, but they are in **different regions** (A and B), so region alone isn't the issue.
- **Approval Resource**: In long cases, approvals are handled by **Manager_Bill**, while short cases are approved by **Manager_Ann** — this may indicate a difference in responsiveness or workload.

---

###  Step 3: Root Cause Analysis

Based on the above analysis:

####  **Root Cause 1: High Complexity Leads to Multiple Document Requests**
- High-complexity cases require more verification and documentation.
- Each document request introduces a **wait time** for customer response, which can be lengthy.
- In Cases 2003 and 2005, multiple document requests **stack up**, causing delays.

####  **Root Cause 2: Resource Adjuster_Mike and Adjuster_Lisa Issue Multiple Requests**
- These adjusters are associated with long-duration cases.
- They may lack sufficient upfront information or tools to resolve cases in fewer iterations.
- This may point to **inconsistent evaluation practices** or **training gaps**.

####  **Root Cause 3: Delayed Approval by Manager_Bill**
- Cases approved by **Manager_Bill** (2003 and 2005) take longer to reach approval than those handled by **Manager_Ann**.
- This could indicate:
  - Manager_Bill has a **higher workload**.
  - Delays in internal approvals or **lack of prioritization**.

###  Step 4: Recommendations to Mitigate Performance Issues

#### 1. **Improve Upfront Data Collection**
- Ensure customers submit **complete documentation** at the time of claim submission.
- Use **automated validation checks** to flag missing or incomplete data early.

#### 2. **Standardize Claim Evaluation Process**
- Provide **training or checklists** for adjusters to reduce the number of back-and-forth requests.
- Consider **AI assistance** for identifying likely missing documents based on claim type.

#### 3. **Implement SLAs Based on Complexity**
- Assign **Service Level Agreements** tailored to complexity levels:
  - Low: < 1 day
  - Medium: < 2 days
  - High: < 5 days
- Track adherence and escalate if thresholds are breached.

#### 4. **Monitor and Balance Workload**
- Monitor resource performance (e.g., number of document requests per adjuster).
- Redistribute workload or provide support to adjusters issuing frequent requests.
- Investigate the approval delays caused by Manager_Bill and consider **process automation** or **approval delegation**.

#### 5. **Use Process Mining Tools**
- Employ tools to visualize process flows and identify bottlenecks dynamically.
- Automate alerts for long-running cases or multiple document requests.

###  Summary

| Case | Duration | Key Attributes | Root Cause |
|------|----------|----------------|------------|
| 2001 | Short    | Low complexity, 0 doc requests | — |
| 2002 | Medium   | Medium complexity, 1 doc request | Moderate delays due to one doc request |
| 2003 | Long     | High complexity, 2 doc requests, Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Bill | Multiple doc requests, delayed approval |
| 2004 | Short    | Low complexity, 0 doc requests | — |
| 2005 | Very Long| High complexity, 3 doc requests, Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Bill | Excessive doc requests, delayed approval |

###  Final Answer

**Cases with Performance Issues**: 2003 and 2005  
**Root Causes**:
1. **High complexity** leads to multiple document requests, increasing case duration.
2. **Adjuster_Mike and Adjuster_Lisa** are associated with issuing multiple requests, suggesting inconsistent evaluation.
3. **Manager_Bill’s approval step** introduces delays compared to Manager_Ann.

**Recommendations**:
- Improve upfront data collection.
- Standardize evaluation practices and reduce redundant requests.
- Implement SLAs based on claim complexity.
- Monitor and balance resource workload.
- Use process mining tools for real-time performance tracking.
