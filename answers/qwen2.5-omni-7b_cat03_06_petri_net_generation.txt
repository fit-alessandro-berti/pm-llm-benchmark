To construct an accepting Petri net for the described insurance claim management process, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the Petri net structure.
2. Create the necessary places and transitions.
3. Add arcs between the places and transitions to establish the flow of the process.
4. Define the initial marking (im) and final marking (fm).
5. Ensure that the Petri net correctly models all possible paths through the process, including loops and alternative paths.

Here's how you can implement it in Python using `pm4py`:

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Step 1: Define the Petri net structure
net = PetriNet(name="Insurance Claim Management Process")

# Step 2: Create the necessary places and transitions
start_place = PetriNet.Place(name="Start")
claim_registration = PetriNet.Transition(name="ClaimRegistration", label="Claim Registration")
document_verification = PetriNet.Transition(name="DocumentVerification", label="Document Verification")
fraud_check = PetriNet.Transition(name="FraudCheck", label="Fraud Check")
claim_assessment = PetriNet.Transition(name="ClaimAssessment", label="Claim Assessment")
approval = PetriNet.Transition(name="Approval", label="Approval")
payment = PetriNet.Transition(name="Payment", label="Payment")
notification = PetriNet.Transition(name="Notification", label="Notification")
closure = PetriNet.Transition(name="Closure", label="Closure")

end_place = PetriNet.Place(name="End")

# Step 3: Add arcs between the places and transitions
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start_place, claim_registration, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_registration, document_verification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(document_verification, fraud_check, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_check, claim_assessment, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_assessment, approval, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(approval, payment, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment, notification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notification, closure, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(closure, end_place, net)

# Step 4: Define the initial marking (im) and final marking (fm)
im = Marking()
im[start_place] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[end_place] = 1

# Step 5: Print the Petri net structure
print("Petri Net Structure:")
print(net)

# Optionally, print the initial and final markings
print("\nInitial Marking:")
print(im)

print("\nFinal Marking:")
print(fm)
```

### Explanation:
- **Places**: Represent different states or points in the process such as "Start," "End," "Claim Registration," "Document Verification," etc.
- **Transitions**: Represent actions like "Claim Registration," "Document Verification," etc.
- **Arcs**: Connect transitions and places to model the flow of the process.
- **Initial Marking (im)**: Places the first token on the "Start" place, indicating the beginning of the process.
- **Final Marking (fm)**: Places the last token on the "End" place, indicating the completion of the process.

This Petri net model captures the sequential nature of the insurance claim management process, including potential loops and alternative paths due to re-documentation or in-depth investigations.
