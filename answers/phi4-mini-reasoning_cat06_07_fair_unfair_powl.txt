<think>
Okay, I need to create two POWL models based on the description provided. Let me start by understanding what each model should look like.

First, the **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**. The key here is that after the skill assessment, there's an XOR branch where one path gives a community affiliation check that advantages certain applicants. So in this model, there will be two branches from the preliminary step: one leading to standard cultural fit evaluation and another to CommunityAffiliationCheck which then affects the final decision.

The **POWL Model Without Unfairness** should avoid any such branching. All candidates go through the same cultural fit check without community affiliation considerations. So there's no XOR here; instead, maybe a choice that leads directly to standardized steps for everyone.

Let me outline both models step by step.

Starting with the first model (with unfairness):

1. **Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check:** This would be a loop structure where if data is missing, they request more info and re-enter the check until it's complete.
   - So maybe an initial Transition node A that checks for completeness. If incomplete, transition to B (RequestMoreInfo), then back to A when done.

2. **Preliminary Skill Assessment:** After resume processing completes, applicants take the skill test (Transition C).
   
3. **Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check (XOR Point):** Here comes the XOR. One branch is standard cultural fit (say Transition D) and another is CommunityAffiliationCheck (Transition E). The other part of the loop would be B again to handle non-affiliated candidates?

Wait, maybe after skill assessment, there's an XOR choice between two paths: one where they do a standard check (CulturalFitStandard), leading into ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision. The other path is CommunityAffiliationCheck which might give them a boost but still goes through CulturalFit and then to managerial review.

Alternatively, the cultural fit step has an XOR that leads either to a normal assessment or community-based adjustment. So from skill assessment completion (Transition C), there's an XOR node where one child is D (standard path) and another E (community check). The standard path proceeds normally: after CulturalFitStandard (say Transition F), then ManagerialReview (G), then FinalDecision H. The community check might also go through a similar process but adds the adjustment.

Wait, maybe in the XOR branch for unfairness model:

- Left child of XOR is C1: Proceed to StandardCulturalFitCheck.
- Right child is CommunityAffiliationCheck which adjusts scores and leads into ManagerialReview regardless (since they get an uplift).

So after skill assessment (Transition X), there's a Choice operator. The left path goes through standard cultural fit, then managerial review. The right path does community check, applies the adjustment, then to managerial review.

In the non-unfair model, all applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck without any XOR branching that differentiates based on affiliations. So after skill assessment (Transition X), there's a Choice operator where both paths lead to StandardCulturalFitCheck and then ManagerialReview, so no differentiation.

Now structuring each model with POWL constructs:

For the unfair model:

- Start with ResumeProcessingLoop: A transitions into itself if data is missing, otherwise proceed. Then Transition C (skill assessment). Then XOR node Y where left child is D (StandardCulturalFit), right child is E (CommunityAffiliationCheck leading to ManagerialReview).

Wait, but how do the loops and choices work here? Let me think in terms of POWL structure.

In the unfair model:

- The initial data completeness check could be represented by a loop between two Transitions: A (check) which if incomplete transitions to B (request info), then back to A. Once complete, proceed to skill assessment C, etc.

Then after C completes, there's an XOR choice Y with children [D, E], where D is StandardCulturalFitCheck and E is CommunityAffiliationCheck followed by ManagerialReview.

Wait, but in POWL models, the loop would be a separate structure. Let me recall that a loop is represented as * (A, B), meaning execute A then either exit or do B then A again.

So for data completeness check: Transition A checks resume info. If missing, transitions to Transition B which requests more info and loops back until complete. Then proceeds to C.

Then after skill assessment (Transition D?), the XOR choice occurs between two paths: one leading to CulturalFitStandard (E1) and another leading to CommunityAffiliationCheck (E2), then proceed similarly to E1 but with an adjustment.

Wait, perhaps in POWL terms:

For unfair model:

- A loop for data completeness check. Let's call this Loop_A = *([CheckResume, CheckResume]) where CheckResume is a Transition that checks if resume info is complete. If not, transitions to RequestInfo (another Transition). Then once complete, exits the loop.

Then after completing the loop, SkillAssessment C is done. Then an XOR choice Y with children [StandardCulturalFit D, CommunityAffiliationCheck E]. The Standard path leads into ManagerialReview F and FinalDecision G. The Community path might adjust scores but then also goes through CulturalFit H (maybe same as standard) leading to ManagerialReview I? Or perhaps the community check itself affects the score before managerial review.

Alternatively, in POWL terms, after SkillAssessment completes (Transition C), there's a XOR node Y with children [D, E]. D is StandardCulturalFitCheck. Then from there proceeds to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F. E is CommunityAffiliationCheck which then directly leads into the same path as D but adds an implicit score adjustment.

But in POWL models, how are these paths structured? Each choice's children can be other nodes or choices/loops.

So maybe for unfair model:

- Loop_A: *([A1, A2]) where A1 is CheckResume. If data incomplete  A2 (RequestInfo). Once complete, exit loop.

Then Transition C (SkillAssessment).

Then XOR node Y with children [D (StandardCulturalFit), E (CommunityAffiliationCheck)].

From D's end: Proceed to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F.

From E's path: After CommunityAffiliationCheck completes, proceed through the same steps as D but apply adjustment. So in POWL terms, perhaps after E (CommunityAffiliationCheck) there's another loop for data completeness? No, that might not be right. Wait, no드fter community check is done, then standard cultural fit and managerial review.

Alternatively, maybe CommunityAffiliationCheck leads into the same ManagerialReview node as D but with an adjustment in their evaluation process.

But how to model this in POWL?

Hmm. Let me try writing out each part step by step for both models.

First Model (with Unfairness):

1. **Data Completeness Loop:**

   - A1: Check resume data.
   - If incomplete, transition to B1: Request more info.
   - Once complete, exit loop and proceed to Skill Assessment C.

   Represented as a loop between A1 and B1 where if the process is not completed (A1 returns Transition), it goes back to B1. But in POWL terms, how?

In PM4Py's POOL models, loops are represented using the * operator. So Loop_A = (*( [CheckResume, CheckResume] )) but with conditions.

Wait, according to the example given earlier:

A loop between A and B is * (A, B), which means execute A then either exit or do B then A again.

So for data completeness check: Start with Transition CheckResume. If not complete, transition to RequestInfo. Once complete, proceed. So perhaps a loop where if CheckResume hasn't completed, go back to itself; otherwise, proceed to next step.

But in POWL terms, transitions can have labels and conditions?

Alternatively, the initial part could be represented as:

Loop_A = (*([CheckResume], [CheckResume])) but not sure. Maybe I need to model this with a loop structure where CheckResume is executed until completion, then proceeds.

Alternatively, perhaps use two Transitions: A (Check resume) which loops back if incomplete, and B (proceed after check). But how?

Wait, the PM4Py documentation says that in StrictPartialOrder or OperatorPOWL nodes. The initial process may start with a loop structure for data completeness.

But according to the example given earlier:

In an unfair model, there's a loop between A and B where if incomplete, you go back to B (request more info) until complete. Then proceed.

So perhaps in POWL terms, this would be represented as Loop_A = *([A, B]), where A is CheckResume and B is ProceedsToSkillAssessment.

But how do we model the condition of completion?

Wait, transitions have an attribute 'enabled' that can evaluate to true or false. So if Transition A (CheckResume) has enabled set such that it checks for data completeness. If not complete, then transition goes back; else proceeds.

So perhaps:

A = Transition(label="CheckResume")
B = Transition(label="ProceedToSkillAssessment")

Loop_A = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])

Then, in the enabled attribute of A, we check if resume data is incomplete. If so, then after processing (checking), transition to the loop again? Wait, but loops are recursive until conditions change.

Alternatively, perhaps using two Transitions: CheckResume and ProceedsToSkillAssessment, connected with a LOOP where CheckResume's children include itself when not complete.

Hmm. Maybe in POWL models, you can have transitions that reference themselves via their labels if certain conditions hold. For example:

A = Transition(label="CheckResume")
B = Transition(label="Proceed")

Then the loop could be represented as * ( [A], [B] ), but I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, using PM4Py's POWL structures: perhaps the data completeness check is part of an OperatorPOWL node with LOOP structure. But I need to make sure that once resume info is complete, it exits the loop and proceeds.

Let me think differently. The initial process for resumes:

- Start at CheckResume (A). If not completed (data missing), transition to RequestInfo (B) which sets A's enabled to true again? Wait, no. Once data is received, how does the process exit the loop?

In PM4Py, in a LOOP with children [A, B], you first execute child A. After executing A, if it has completed and its enabled attribute evaluates to true (i.e., not exited), then choose between continuing A or switching to B.

Wait, perhaps:

Loop_A = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CheckResume, ProceedsToSkillAssessment])

In the CheckResume transition's 'enabled' attribute, we check if resume data is complete. If yes, proceed (exit loop). Otherwise, go back into A again? But in POWL models, loops are executed until a condition allows exiting.

Alternatively, perhaps using two Transitions: CheckResume and ProceedsToSkillAssessment connected with an XOR or LOOP structure where the process continues looping only if data is incomplete.

But according to PM4Py's documentation for loops:

A loop between A and B (operator * ) tells that you execute A then either exit the loop or execute B and then repeat, executing A again. So in this case, after completing CheckResume (A), check enabled. If not exited, decide whether to re-execute A (loop) or switch to ProceedsToSkillAssessment (B).

So if resume data is incomplete when checked, transition back into the loop (so execute A again). Once complete, exit the loop and proceed.

Thus, in POWL terms:

CheckResume = Transition(label="CheckResume")
ProceedsToSkillAssessment = Transition(label="Proceed")

Loop_A = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CheckResume, ProceedsToSkillAssessment])

Then, for CheckResume's enabled attribute: check if data is complete. If yes  exit loop; else, transition to itself (so the loop continues).

Now moving on.

After Loop_A completes, proceed to SkillAssessment C:

Transition SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

Once that completes, an XOR choice occurs between two paths: one leading to StandardCulturalFit D and another to CommunityAffiliationCheck E. Both may then lead into ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F.

So the unfair model's structure after skill assessment would be:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D (StandardCulturalFit), E (CommunityAffiliationCheck)])

Then D leads to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F. Similarly, what about path E? Does CommunityAffiliationCheck then proceed through the same steps as StandardCulturalFit?

Assuming that after CommunityAffiliationCheck completes, it also goes into CulturalFit H followed by managerial review.

But in POWL models, how are these paths structured? Each choice's children can be other nodes or choices/loops. So for path E (CommunityAffiliationCheck), perhaps:

After completing CommunityAffiliationCheck E, there's a Transition to proceed as D but with an adjustment applied during the ManagerialReview step.

Alternatively, after E completes, it leads into another loop that includes both paths of cultural fit and managerial review adjusted based on community affiliation.

But this might complicate things. Maybe in POWL terms:

After SkillAssessment (C), there's a Choice operator Y with children [D, E].

- Child D: StandardCulturalFitCheck.
   - After completing D, proceed to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F.

- Child E: CommunityAffiliationCheck.
   - Completing E leads into the same path as D but adds an adjustment. So perhaps after E completes, it merges back with the main process or follows a similar structure.

Wait, in POWL models, once you take one branch of a choice (like child D), then to proceed further steps would require another choice? Or can multiple choices be connected?

No, if it's part of the same OperatorPOWL node's children. So after E completes CommunityAffiliationCheck, it needs to merge back into some common path leading to ManagerialReview.

Alternatively, maybe CommunityAffiliationCheck leads directly into a transition that goes through standard cultural fit and managerial review but with an adjustment in their scores during evaluation by managers.

But modeling this would require additional steps. For example:

After E (CommunityAffiliationCheck) completes, there's another Loop_A' for data completeness again? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, after CommunityAffiliationCheck E completes, the process proceeds to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F with an implicit adjustment based on community affiliation.

But in POWL terms, how is this represented?

Perhaps:

Transition AfterCommunity = Transition(label="AfterCommunity")
Loop_A_2 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AfterCommunity])
XOR_node_children = [D (StandardCulturalFit), Loop_A_2]

Then the XOR choice would have two children: D and Loop_A_2. But this seems more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps CommunityAffiliationCheck leads into a merged path where after E completes, both paths converge again to proceed through ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F.

But how? Because once you take one branch of an XOR (like child D), the other branches are not executed unless all have completed. Wait, no. In POWL models with choices, when multiple children exist under a Choice operator, each child's execution is independent; however, in some cases like XOR, only one path runs at a time until completion.

Wait, according to PM4Py's documentation: the choice operator defines how concurrent executions of its children proceed:

- StrictChoice (the default) requires that all but exactly zero choices are completed.
- WeakChoice allows for any combination except both being uncompleted when multiple exist. But XOR is specific between two.

So in an XOR choice, only one path runs until completion; the other paths remain blocked until their respective Choice operator's children complete.

Therefore, if after SkillAssessment (C), we have a Choice operator with two children: D (StandardCulturalFit) and E (CommunityAffiliationCheck). Once either completes, all choices are unblocked. But since it's an XOR choice between exactly one of them at any time until both may run in parallel? Wait, no.

Actually, the definition says that for multiple children under a Choice operator with weak ordering (like WeakChoice), they can proceed concurrently as long as not exiting or merging. For StrongChoice (not used here) all must complete before proceeding.

But XOR is exclusive between two choices: only one of them runs at any time until completion; but others may be blocked unless completed by the chosen path first? Or perhaps in this case, since it's an XOR choice with exactly two children, they run sequentially. Hmm, maybe I need to check.

Alternatively, for a Choice operator with multiple weak ordering (WeakChoice), each child's execution is allowed only if all stronger choices are complete. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Assuming that in our case, after SkillAssessment completes, there's an XOR choice between D and E. So once either child completes their path, they unblock the other paths but don't run simultaneously unless merged later.

But this complicates modeling where both paths could merge back into a common process leading to ManagerialReview.

Alternatively, perhaps CommunityAffiliationCheck (E) leads directly into the same ManagerialReview as D without any further choices. So after E completes, you proceed with ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F but apply an adjustment during evaluation based on community affiliation.

In that case, in POWL terms:

After SkillAssessment C completes:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D (StandardCulturalFit), Loop_A_2])

Where Loop_A_2 is a loop between E (CommunityAffiliationCheck) and some common path to ManagerialReview.

Wait, maybe after CommunityAffiliationCheck E completes, the process merges back into a merged branch that leads through CulturalFit H and then to managerial review M. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps in POWL models, you can have transitions merge together by using SilentTrans or other nodes. For example:

After D (StandardCulturalFit) completes, proceed via Transition X to ManagerialReview.

Similarly, after E (CommunityAffiliationCheck) completes, also transition via a different path but same manager review M.

But in POWL models, the order of execution is determined by partial orders and choices/loops. So if both D and E eventually lead into the same transitions towards managerial review, then once either has completed their child paths under XOR choice, they can proceed to those common steps.

So perhaps after SkillAssessment C completes:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D (StandardCulturalFit), E (CommunityAffiliationCheck)], order={D->M, E->M})

But the exact connections would need to be made with transitions leading from D and E into ManagerialReview M.

So for path D:

Transition D: StandardCulturalFit  Transition X1 to ManagerialReview M  FinalDecision F

For path E:

Transition E: CommunityAffiliationCheck  Merge back into a common transition Y1 that goes to ManagerialReview M, but with an adjustment in the manager's evaluation based on community affiliation.

But how is this modeled? Perhaps after completing E, there's another choice or loop that merges both paths. But since it's XOR between D and E at the time of SkillAssessment completion, once one completes their child path (D or E), they proceed to ManagerialReview M. The other child's execution may be blocked unless completed by some merging.

Alternatively, in POWL models, you can use SilentTransitions to merge branches. So after completing either D or E under XOR choice, the process continues through a common branch via transitions that both paths share until reaching FinalDecision.

For example:

XOR_node has children [D (StandardCulturalFit), Loop_A_2], where Loop_A_2 is a loop between CommunityAffiliationCheck and some common path. But this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, after SkillAssessment C completes, the XOR choice's two branches are D and E. Once either D or E completes their child paths:

- If D (StandardCulturalFit) completed  proceed to ManagerialReview M.
- If E (CommunityAffiliationCheck) completed  same path but with adjustment during manager review.

But in POWL models, you can have parallel executions if multiple branches are allowed. However, XOR choice only allows one branch at a time until completion. Wait, no듖OR choice is exclusive between the two children; once any of them completes their child paths (if there were sub-choices), then all choices may be unblocked.

But in this case, D and E are top-level branches under an XOR choice after SkillAssessment. Once either branch's execution reaches completion (i.e., both path ends?), they proceed to manager review.

Assuming that once the XOR child completes its own evaluation, regardless of which one it was, then all paths converge again into a common process leading to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F.

But how is this modeled in POWL? Maybe using SilentTransitions or merging nodes.

Alternatively, after SkillAssessment C completes:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D (StandardCulturalFit), E (CommunityAffiliationCheck)])

Then both D and E may have their own child choices/loops that lead to ManagerialReview M. Once either D or E's process reaches the point where they can proceed to manager review, then all paths are merged.

But I'm getting stuck on how exactly to model this in POWL structures according to PM4Py's syntax.

Alternatively, perhaps after SkillAssessment C completes:

XOR_node has children [D (StandardCulturalFit), Loop_A_2], where Loop_A_2 is a loop that includes CommunityAffiliationCheck and proceeds through the common path. But I'm not sure.

Let me think of an example from PM4Py's POWL models examples.

In one example, there's a choice between two branches under XOR, which allows only one branch to proceed until completion. So in our case:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D (StandardCulturalFit), E (CommunityAffiliationCheck)])

Assume that both D and E lead into ManagerialReview M after their respective evaluations.

Once either D or E completes its child path under the XOR choice, then all choices are unblocked. However, since it's an exclusive OR between two branches at any time until completion of one branch's evaluation (assuming each has no further sub-choices), once a branch ends execution, it proceeds to manager review M and final decision F.

But how is this modeled? Perhaps after completing either D or E under XOR choice:

D completes  Transition X1 to ManagerialReview M

E completes  same as above but with adjustment in evaluation by the manager.

But PM4Py models don't track such adjustments; it's more about structural choices. The unfairness comes from where these branches are taken, not how they affect outcomes beyond structure.

So perhaps after SkillAssessment C completes:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D (StandardCulturalFit), E (CommunityAffiliationCheck)])

Both D and E have their own child choices leading to ManagerialReview M. Once either D or E is completed, they proceed to manager review.

But in POWL models, you can represent this by having both branches merge into a common path after completion of one branch's evaluation under XOR choice.

For example:

After SkillAssessment C completes:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D (StandardCulturalFit), E (CommunityAffiliationCheck)])

Then D has child X1 to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F. Similarly, after completing CommunityAffiliationCheck E, the process merges back into a common path that includes some adjustments.

But how?

Alternatively, use two separate loops for each branch but merge them later with choices or silent nodes.

This is getting quite complicated. Let me try to outline both models step by step and then translate them into POWL code as per PM4Py's syntax.

**First Model (with Unfairness):**

1. **Data Completeness Check Loop:**
   - Transition A (CheckResume) loops back if data incomplete.
   - Proceeds to SkillAssessment C once complete.

2. **Skill Assessment Completion:** Done by another Transition D.

3. **XOR Choice between StandardCulturalFit and CommunityAffiliationCheck:**
   - Left child E1: StandardCulturalFit, leading to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F.
   - Right child E2: CommunityAffiliationCheck, which also leads to same path but with adjustment in evaluation.

So the POWL model would have:

- Loop_A = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A (CheckResume), B (ProceedsToSkillAssessment)])

But need to ensure that once resume data is complete, it exits loop and proceeds. So A's enabled attribute checks for completeness; if not, transition back into the loop.

Then Transition C (SkillAssessment).

After completing SkillAssessment, XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E1 (StandardCulturalFit), E2 (CommunityAffiliationCheck)])

Where:

- E1 leads to M and F.
- E2 also merges back with common path after completion.

But how do we model the merging? Maybe use a SilentTransition or another loop that allows both paths to converge once either is completed.

Alternatively, in PM4Py's POWL models, you can have transitions merge using StrictPartialOrder nodes. So:

After SkillAssessment C completes:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E1 (StandardCulturalFit), E2 (CommunityAffiliationCheck)])

Then both E1 and E2 eventually lead to the same ManagerialReview M via some common transitions.

For example:

E1 after completing StandardCulturalFit  Transition X to ManagerialReview.
E2 after completing CommunityAffiliationCheck  SilentTransition that merges with a transition leading to ManagerialReview.

But this might not be accurate. Alternatively, once either E1 or E2 completes their child paths under the XOR choice, all choices are unblocked and proceed through common transitions.

So:

XOR_node_children = [E1 (StandardCulturalFit), SilentTransition()]

Where after completing StandardCulturalFit (E1)  Transition X to ManagerialReview M, and if CommunityAffiliationCheck completes (E2), then the silent transition merges into this path. Thus, both paths converge on ManagerialReview.

But in PM4Py's syntax:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E1, SilentTransition()], order={})

Where E1 is a choice leading to manager review and SilentTransition ensures that if the other branch completes (CommunityAffiliationCheck), it doesn't block further progress.

Thus, in this model, once either path under XOR choice completes their child paths (StandardCulturalFit or CommunityAffiliationCheck), they both proceed via Transition X to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F. The community affiliation gives an implicit advantage during the manager's review phase but is not modeled explicitly in POWL structures듥ust structurally.

So putting it all together:

Model 1: With unfairness

- DataCompletenessLoop: *([A (CheckResume), B (ProceedsToSkillAssessment)])
   A loops back if incomplete.
   
- Transition SkillAssessment C
   
- XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E1 (StandardCulturalFit), SilentTransition()])
      E1 leads to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F.

**Model 2: Without Unfairness**

Here, there's no community affiliation check. So after SkillAssessment completion:

- Choice operator is a WeakChoice between StandardCulturalFit D and CommunityAffiliationCheck C (but without the bias). But since both are treated equally in terms of structural path but not in content.

Wait, no듮he model should ensure that all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation. So there shouldn't be any XOR branching based on community affiliation. Instead, there's a single choice after SkillAssessment leading to StandardCulturalFit and then ManagerialReview.

So Model 2 would have:

- DataCompletenessLoop as in Model 1.
- Transition SkillAssessment C.
- Choice operator Y = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D (StandardCulturalFit), E (CommunityAffiliationCheck)], order={}) but this is not correct. Wait, no들f there's no unfairness branch, then the XOR choice doesn't exist; it's a StrictChoice where both paths must complete before proceeding.

Alternatively, in Model 2:

After SkillAssessment C completes, all applicants go through StandardCulturalFit D and then proceed to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F. There's no CommunityAffiliationCheck step or any branching that differentiates based on affiliations.

So the choice after SkillAssessment is a StrictChoice where both branches must complete before proceeding further. But in POWL models, there's no inherent bias듥ust structural representation.

But according to PM4Py's syntax:

In Model 2, there should be no CommunityAffiliationCheck branch under XOR. So instead of an XOR operator with two children (StandardCulturalFit and CommunityAffiliationCheck), the choice after SkillAssessment is a StrictChoice where both branches must complete before proceeding.

But how to model this? Alternatively, there's no such branching들t's not part of the workflow because community affiliation doesn't affect it. Wait, but according to the problem statement, in Model 2 there should be no XOR branch providing selective advantages, meaning all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation without any branches that give preferences.

So perhaps in Model 2:

After SkillAssessment C completes, there's a Choice operator with two children: D (StandardCulturalFit) and E (another Standard path), but both are part of StrictChoice. But this would require merging paths after completion of both, which may not make sense.

Alternatively, since community affiliation doesn't affect the process in Model 2, there is no XOR choice들t's a sequential model where all applicants go through standard cultural fit check without any branching based on affiliations.

Thus, in POWL terms:

DataCompletenessLoop as before (A and B loop).

SkillAssessment C.

After SkillAssessment completes, there's a Choice operator with two children: D (StandardCulturalFit) leading to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F. No CommunityAffiliationCheck branch exists here; it's simply another path that merges back into the common process after completion of StandardCulturalFit.

Wait, but in POWL models, if you have multiple choices under a Choice operator with WeakChoice (default), their executions are concurrent as long as they don't exit or merge.

So for Model 2:

After SkillAssessment C completes:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D (StandardCulturalFit), E (AnotherPath)], order={})

Where D leads to M and F, and AnotherPath merges back into the common process. But since there's no community affiliation check in Model 2, this might not apply.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a single Choice operator after SkillAssessment with only one child: StandardCulturalFit D, leading to ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F. Since all applicants go through the same path without any XOR branching based on affiliations.

But according to PM4Py's syntax, an XOR choice requires two children; if there's no unfairness branch, then perhaps it's a single transition from SkillAssessment C directly to StandardCulturalFit D (without any Choice operator), making it sequential rather than concurrent.

So Model 2 would have:

- DataCompletenessLoop as before.
- Transition SkillAssessment C  Transition D (StandardCulturalFit)  Transition M (ManagerialReview)  Transition F (FinalDecision).

Thus, no XOR choice exists in this model; it's a linear path after SkillAssessment without any branching based on community affiliation.

But according to the problem statement, both models should have steps like skill assessment and managerial review. So perhaps:

**Model 2 Structure:**

1. DataCompletenessLoop same as Model 1.
2. Transition C (SkillAssessment).
3. Choice operator with children [D (StandardCulturalFit), E (Another path but not CommunityAffiliationCheck)].

But if there's no unfairness branch, maybe the choice is a StrictChoice between D and another standard check that merges back into common process after both complete. But this would require multiple choices under XOR which might complicate things.

Alternatively, in Model 2:

After SkillAssessment C completes, all applicants proceed to StandardCulturalFit D (without any branching), then ManagerialReview M and FinalDecision F. So there's no XOR choice here; it's a sequential path from SkillAssessment  CulturalFitStandard  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Thus, the POWL model would be:

- DataCompletenessLoop: *([A, B])
   A checks resume data.
- Transition C (SkillAssessment)
- Transition D (StandardCulturalFit)  Transition M (ManagerialReview)  Transition F (FinalDecision)

No XOR branching exists here because community affiliation doesn't play a role.

So summarizing both models:

**Model 1: With Unfairness**

- DataCompletenessLoop (*([A, B])) where A checks resume data. If incomplete, loop back to A.
- Transition C (SkillAssessment).
- XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E1 (StandardCulturalFit), SilentTransition()])  E1 leads to M and F; if CommunityAffiliationCheck is taken but not specified here? Wait, no든arlier thought that the right child of XOR would be CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Wait, perhaps in Model 1:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E1 (StandardCulturalFit), E2 (CommunityAffiliationCheck)]))

Where both E1 and E2 lead to ManagerialReview M via some common path. For example:

After SkillAssessment C completes:

XOR_node has children [E1 (StandardCulturalFit), Loop_A_2], where Loop_A_2 is a loop that includes CommunityAffiliationCheck E and then proceeds through the same steps as StandardCulturalFit.

But this seems complex. Alternatively, after completing either path under XOR choice, both converge to ManagerialReview M via some common transitions.

Thus, in POWL code for Model 1:

Loop_A = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CheckResume, ProceedsToSkillAssessment])

ProceedsToSkillAssessment would have CheckResume as child A (enabled based on data completeness).

After SkillAssessment C completes:

XOR_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFit, CommunityAffiliationCheck], order={})

Where StandardCulturalFit and CommunityAffiliationCheck both eventually lead to ManagerialReview M. So after completing either of their child paths under XOR choice, the process proceeds via common transitions.

For example:

XOR_node_children = [E1 (StandardCulturalFit), E2 (CommunityAffiliationCheck)]

But then both E1 and E2 need to merge back into a common path leading to ManagerialReview M. How?

Perhaps using SilentTransitions or merging nodes.

Alternatively, after completing either branch under XOR choice:

- StandardCulturalFit completes  Transition X to ManagerialReview.
- CommunityAffiliationCheck completes  same transition but with adjustment in evaluation by the manager.

But structural model doesn't capture that; it's about how branches are taken. The unfairness is introduced structurally via the XOR branching, not through algorithmic adjustments during managerial review.

Thus, regardless of any potential biases in later stages (like managerial review), the presence of the XOR choice introduces a bias at this point by allowing community-affiliated applicants to take an alternative path that could lead to higher chances due to implicit score adjustments or other factors introduced there.

But according to the problem statement, the unfairness is present during the cultural fit evaluation step where certain affiliations give preferential treatment. So in Model 1, after SkillAssessment completes, there's an XOR choice between StandardCulturalFit and CommunityAffiliationCheck steps. The community check gives a slight uplift which may affect managerial review.

But structurally, how to model that?

Assuming that both paths under the XOR choice eventually lead to ManagerialReview M but with different evaluations based on path taken:

- Path E1 (StandardCulturalFit)  no adjustment.
- Path E2 (CommunityAffiliationCheck)  applies an uplift before proceeding.

But in POWL models, you can't model algorithmic adjustments; it's about structural choices. Thus, the community check may influence subsequent steps via merging or additional transitions that are common to both paths but with different evaluations based on affiliation.

Alternatively, after CommunityAffiliationCheck E completes, there's a transition that goes through CulturalFit H and ManagerialReview M with an adjustment.

But this would require additional loops.

Given time constraints, I'll proceed to write the POWL models for both cases as per the required structure.

**Final Answer**

The two POWL models are defined as follows:

1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**
   ```python
   from pm4py.objects.pwl.obj import Transition, SilentTransition, OperatorPOWL, StrictPartialOrder

   # Data Completeness Loop
   A = Transition(label="CheckResume")
   B = Transition(label="ProceedsToSkillAssessment")

   data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])

   # Skill Assessment
   C = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

   # XOR Choice after Skill Assessment: StandardCulturalFit vs CommunityAffiliationCheck
   D = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFit")
   E = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

   xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D, SilentTransition()], order={})

   manager_review_transition = Transition(label="ProceedToManagerialReview")

   # Merging both paths to common Managerial Review
   merged_path = [manager_review_transition]

   root_with_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(
       nodes=[data_loop, C] + xor_node.nodes() + merged_path,
       order={data_loop: xor_node}
   )
   ```

2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness:**
   ```python
   from pm4py.objects.pwl.obj import Transition

   # Data Completeness Loop remains the same as above.

   C = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

   # No XOR choice; both applicants go through StandardCulturalFit and then ManagerialReview.
   D = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFit")
   manager_review_transition = Transition(label="ProceedToManagerialReview")

   root_without_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(
       nodes=[data_loop, C] + [D, manager_review_transition],
       order={data_loop: data_loop}
   )
   ```

(Note: The actual PM4Py code may require more precise structuring with transitions and partial orders as per the framework's requirements. Adjustments to enabled attributes and merging paths are conceptual for this answer.)

**POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**  
This model includes an XOR branching after skill assessment, allowing applicants either a standard cultural fit evaluation or a community-affiliation check that implicitly advantages certain candidates.

```python
from pm4py.objects.pwl.obj import Transition, SilentTransition, OperatorPOWL, StrictPartialOrder

# Data Completeness Loop: CheckResume loops back if incomplete.
A = Transition(label="CheckResume")
B = Transition(label="ProceedsToSkillAssessment")
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])

# Skill Assessment
C = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# XOR Choice after Skill Assessment:
D = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFit")  # Standard path.
E = SilentTransition()                      # Community-affiliation check merges later.

xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D, E], order={})

# Merge both paths to common Managerial Review and Final Decision
manager_review_transition = Transition(label="ProceedToManagerialReview")
merged_path = [manager_review_transition]

root_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[data_loop, C] + xor_node.nodes() + merged_path,
    order={data_loop: xor_node}
)
```

**POWL Model Without Unfairness:**  
This model removes the XOR branching. All applicants undergo identical cultural fit evaluations without community-affiliation considerations.

```python
from pm4py.objects.pwl.obj import Transition, StrictPartialOrder

# Data Completeness Loop remains the same.
A = Transition(label="CheckResume")
B = Transition(label="ProceedsToSkillAssessment")
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])

C = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

D = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFit")  # Unified path for all applicants.
manager_review_transition = Transition(label="ProceedToManagerialReview")

root_unfairness_removed = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[data_loop, C] + [D, manager_review_transition],
    order={data_loop: data_loop}
)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Model with Unfairness**  
   - Applicants undergo a loop for resume verification.
   - After skill assessment, an XOR choice directs candidates to either a standard cultural fit evaluation or community-affiliation check (E), which merges later into common paths toward managerial review.

2. **Model Without Unfairness**  
   - Removes the XOR branch and combines all applicants through identical cultural fit evaluations before managerial review, ensuring no structural bias based on affiliations. 

Both models use POWL constructs to highlight procedural fairness while demonstrating how branching can introduce implicit biases.
