Sure! Here's an example of a Log Skeleton model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    'always_before': {
        ('create_purchase_order', 'send_purchase_order'),
        ('send_purchase_order', 'receive_products'),
        ('receive_products', 'create_invoice'),
        ('create_invoice', 'pay_invoice')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('send_purchase_order', 'create_purchase_order'),
        ('receive_products', 'send_purchase_order'),
        ('create_invoice', 'receive_products'),
        ('pay_invoice', 'create_invoice')
    },
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {
        'create_purchase_order': {1},
        'send_purchase_order': {1},
        'receive_products': {1},
        'create_invoice': {1},
        'pay_invoice': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('create_purchase_order', 'send_purchase_order'),
        ('send_purchase_order', 'receive_products'),
        ('receive_products', 'create_invoice'),
        ('create_invoice', 'pay_invoice')
    }
}
```
In this example, the Log Skeleton model specifies that the following activities occur in a linear sequence:

1. Create Purchase Order
2. Send Purchase Order
3. Receive Products
4. Create Invoice
5. Pay Invoice

The model also specifies that each activity occurs exactly once, using the `'activ_freq'` constraint. The `'always_before'` and `'always_after'` constraints are used to enforce the order of the activities, while the `'directly_follows'` constraint specifies that each activity is immediately followed by the next activity in the sequence. Finally, the `''never_together''` constraint is empty, indicating that there are no activities that cannot co-exist in the same case.
