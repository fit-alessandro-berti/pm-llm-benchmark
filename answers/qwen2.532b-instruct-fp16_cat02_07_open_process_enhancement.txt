Process enhancement in the context of process mining is focused on improving an organization's existing processes to increase efficiency, reduce costs, or achieve other business objectives. Process mining is a field that utilizes event logs and data analysis techniques to discover, monitor, and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from event data.

### Process Discovery

Before diving into process enhancement, let’s briefly revisit process discovery since it often serves as the first step in many process mining applications:

- **Process Discovery**: This involves creating a process model automatically from an event log. The goal is to understand what actually happens in the process without having preconceived ideas or models. It helps organizations visualize and understand their actual processes, which may differ significantly from the intended or designed process.

### Conformance Checking

Another core activity related to process mining is:

- **Conformance Checking**: This refers to the analysis that compares the modeled (expected) process with what actually occurred in an event log. The goal is to detect deviations between the model and reality, understand where bottlenecks occur, identify unnecessary steps, and pinpoint areas for improvement.

### Process Enhancement

Now onto process enhancement:

- **Process Enhancement**: Unlike process discovery and conformance checking which are more about understanding and comparing processes, process enhancement actively seeks ways to improve them. This phase involves using insights gathered from previous phases (like the deviations identified in conformance checking) to make strategic changes that can lead to better outcomes.

### How Process Enhancement Differs

- **Focus**: While discovery focuses on uncovering hidden process structures and conformance checks for discrepancies, enhancement is about implementing improvements.
  
- **Action vs. Analysis**: Discovery and conformance are fundamentally analytical processes aimed at understanding current states. Enhancement, however, is about action—taking what has been learned to make actual changes.

- **Outcome**: The outcomes of discovery might be a clearer picture of how work really gets done in an organization, and conformance might reveal where this deviates from expected norms. In contrast, the output of enhancement would include revised process models, new policies or procedures, software adjustments (if automated processes are involved), and so forth.

### Example Scenario

Imagine a customer service call center that uses process mining to analyze its operations:

1. **Discovery**: The first phase reveals that customers often have to be transferred between representatives multiple times before their issues are resolved.
2. **Conformance Checking**: This step might find that the actual workflow is not aligned with the organization's intended model, perhaps due to an inefficient system of routing calls or lack of training on handling common requests.
3. **Enhancement**: With this knowledge, the company could then develop a streamlined process for dealing with customer queries—perhaps by introducing self-service options where feasible and improving agent training to handle more issues directly.

In essence, while discovery and conformance checking are essential preparatory steps that inform us about what processes look like in reality and how they perform, process enhancement is about making use of this knowledge to optimize and innovate within the business.
