**Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model**

1. **Receive to Approve (R to P):**
   - **Average Time:** Approximately 25 hours (90,000 seconds).
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (3,600 seconds), which is suspiciously low.
   - **Anomaly:** The unusually low standard deviation suggests that the time between receiving and approving claims is almost constant, indicating a rigid schedule or automated process that doesn't account for variability in claim complexity.

2. **Approve to Notify (P to N):**
   - **Average Time:** 7 days (604,800 seconds).
   - **Standard Deviation:** 2 days (172,800 seconds), which is unusually high.
   - **Anomaly:** The long and highly variable delay between approval and customer notification suggests inconsistency. Some notifications are delayed significantly, while others are sent quickly, pointing toward process inefficiencies or resource bottlenecks.

3. **Assign to Close (A to C):**
   - **Average Time:** 2 hours (7,200 seconds).
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (3,600 seconds).
   - **Anomaly:** Claims are being closed shortly after assignment without evidence of intermediate steps like evaluation or approval, indicating possible premature closure or bypassing of standard procedures.

4. **Evaluate to Notify (E to N):**
   - **Average Time:** 5 minutes (300 seconds).
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute (60 seconds), very low.
   - **Anomaly:** The extremely short and consistent time between evaluation and notification may indicate that necessary steps (like approval) are being skipped or that the process is overly automated without adequate checks.

**Hypotheses for the Anomalies**

- **System Automation or Scheduling Issues:**
  - The consistency in timing between certain activities (e.g., R to P) suggests automated processes or scheduled tasks that do not adapt to individual claim needs.
  - Automated systems might be approving claims at fixed intervals without thorough review.

- **Resource Constraints and Bottlenecks:**
  - The delays between approval and notification (P to N) could result from staffing shortages, leading to backlogs.
  - High variability in notification times indicates inconsistent resource availability or prioritization issues.

- **Process Deviations or Policy Changes:**
  - Quick closures after assignment (A to C) might be due to policy changes where certain claims are auto-closed if they don't meet specific criteria.
  - Necessary steps may be intentionally skipped to expedite processing, possibly contravening standard procedures.

- **Manual Data Entry Delays:**
  - Large standard deviations suggest that manual processes are causing delays due to human factors like data entry errors or delays.

- **Skipped Intermediary Steps:**
  - Rapid transitions (e.g., E to N) could indicate that intermediary steps like approval are being bypassed, either due to system errors or workflow misconfigurations.

**Proposed Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries**

1. **Identify Claims with Unusually Consistent Approval Times (R to P):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     c.claim_id,
     MIN(receive.timestamp) AS receive_time,
     MIN(approve.timestamp) AS approve_time,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(approve.timestamp) - MIN(receive.timestamp))) AS time_diff_seconds
   FROM
     claims c
     JOIN claim_events receive ON c.claim_id = receive.claim_id AND receive.activity = 'R'
     JOIN claim_events approve ON c.claim_id = approve.claim_id AND approve.activity = 'P'
   GROUP BY
     c.claim_id
   HAVING
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(approve.timestamp) - MIN(receive.timestamp))) BETWEEN 86400 AND 93600 -- 24 to 26 hours
   ORDER BY
     time_diff_seconds;
   ```

   *Purpose:* Find claims where approval happens almost exactly 25 hours after receipt, indicating a possible automated schedule.

2. **Find Claims with Extensive Delays Between Approval and Notification (P to N):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     c.claim_id,
     MIN(approve.timestamp) AS approve_time,
     MIN(notify.timestamp) AS notify_time,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(notify.timestamp) - MIN(approve.timestamp))) AS time_diff_seconds
   FROM
     claims c
     JOIN claim_events approve ON c.claim_id = approve.claim_id AND approve.activity = 'P'
     JOIN claim_events notify ON c.claim_id = notify.claim_id AND notify.activity = 'N'
   GROUP BY
     c.claim_id
   HAVING
     time_diff_seconds > 432000 -- More than 5 days
   ORDER BY
     time_diff_seconds DESC;
   ```

   *Purpose:* Identify claims where customers are notified more than 5 days after approval, highlighting significant delays.

3. **Detect Claims Closed Soon After Assignment Without Evaluation or Approval (A to C):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     c.claim_id,
     MIN(assign.timestamp) AS assign_time,
     MIN(close.timestamp) AS close_time,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(close.timestamp) - MIN(assign.timestamp))) AS time_diff_seconds
   FROM
     claims c
     JOIN claim_events assign ON c.claim_id = assign.claim_id AND assign.activity = 'A'
     JOIN claim_events close ON c.claim_id = close.claim_id AND close.activity = 'C'
     LEFT JOIN claim_events evaluate ON c.claim_id = evaluate.claim_id AND evaluate.activity = 'E'
     LEFT JOIN claim_events approve ON c.claim_id = approve.claim_id AND approve.activity = 'P'
   WHERE
     evaluate.event_id IS NULL
     OR approve.event_id IS NULL
   GROUP BY
     c.claim_id
   HAVING
     time_diff_seconds < 14400 -- Less than 4 hours
   ORDER BY
     time_diff_seconds;
   ```

   *Purpose:* Find claims that were closed quickly after assignment without going through evaluation or approval, suggesting skipped steps.

4. **Identify Rapid Transitions from Evaluation to Notification (E to N):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     c.claim_id,
     MIN(evaluate.timestamp) AS evaluate_time,
     MIN(notify.timestamp) AS notify_time,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(notify.timestamp) - MIN(evaluate.timestamp))) AS time_diff_seconds
   FROM
     claims c
     JOIN claim_events evaluate ON c.claim_id = evaluate.claim_id AND evaluate.activity = 'E'
     JOIN claim_events notify ON c.claim_id = notify.claim_id AND notify.activity = 'N'
   GROUP BY
     c.claim_id
   HAVING
     time_diff_seconds < 600 -- Less than 10 minutes
   ORDER BY
     time_diff_seconds;
   ```

   *Purpose:* Detect claims where notification follows evaluation almost immediately, potentially skipping approval steps.

5. **Correlate Anomalies with Specific Adjusters or Resources:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     a.adjuster_id,
     a.name,
     COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id) AS num_anomalous_claims,
     AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close.timestamp - assign.timestamp))) AS avg_time_assign_to_close
   FROM
     claims c
     JOIN claim_events assign ON c.claim_id = assign.claim_id AND assign.activity = 'A'
     JOIN claim_events close ON c.claim_id = close.claim_id AND close.activity = 'C'
     JOIN adjusters a ON assign.resource = a.name
   WHERE
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close.timestamp - assign.timestamp)) < 14400 -- Less than 4 hours
   GROUP BY
     a.adjuster_id,
     a.name
   ORDER BY
     num_anomalous_claims DESC;
   ```

   *Purpose:* Identify adjusters associated with quick claim closures to see if certain individuals are linked to the anomaly.

6. **Analyze Delays Based on Claim Type:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     c.claim_type,
     AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify.timestamp - approve.timestamp))) AS avg_time_approve_to_notify,
     STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify.timestamp - approve.timestamp))) AS stddev_time_approve_to_notify,
     COUNT(*) AS total_claims
   FROM
     claims c
     JOIN claim_events approve ON c.claim_id = approve.claim_id AND approve.activity = 'P'
     JOIN claim_events notify ON c.claim_id = notify.claim_id AND notify.activity = 'N'
   GROUP BY
     c.claim_type
   HAVING
     AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify.timestamp - approve.timestamp))) > 432000 -- Average more than 5 days
     OR STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify.timestamp - approve.timestamp))) > 172800 -- Standard deviation more than 2 days
   ORDER BY
     avg_time_approve_to_notify DESC;
   ```

   *Purpose:* Determine if specific claim types (e.g., "home_insurance" or "auto_insurance") are more prone to delays between approval and notification.

7. **Investigate Claims with Missing Intermediate Activities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ce.claim_id,
     STRING_AGG(ce.activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS activity_sequence
   FROM
     claim_events ce
   GROUP BY
     ce.claim_id
   HAVING
     -- Claims that have 'A' and 'C' but missing 'E' or 'P'
     BOOL_AND(ce.activity IN ('A', 'C')) AND NOT BOOL_OR(ce.activity IN ('E', 'P'))
   ORDER BY
     ce.claim_id;
   ```

   *Purpose:* Find claims where evaluation ('E') or approval ('P') activities are missing, indicating potential process skips.

8. **Check for Regional Patterns in Anomalies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     a.region,
     COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id) AS num_anomalous_claims,
     AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify.timestamp - approve.timestamp))) AS avg_delay_notify,
     STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify.timestamp - approve.timestamp))) AS stddev_delay_notify
   FROM
     claims c
     JOIN claim_events approve ON c.claim_id = approve.claim_id AND approve.activity = 'P'
     JOIN claim_events notify ON c.claim_id = notify.claim_id AND notify.activity = 'N'
     JOIN claim_events assign ON c.claim_id = assign.claim_id AND assign.activity = 'A'
     JOIN adjusters a ON assign.resource = a.name
   WHERE
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify.timestamp - approve.timestamp)) > 432000 -- Delays over 5 days
   GROUP BY
     a.region
   ORDER BY
     num_anomalous_claims DESC;
   ```

   *Purpose:* Identify if certain regions have more significant delays between approval and notification, suggesting localized issues.

**Note:** Before executing these queries, ensure that proper indexing is in place on frequently joined columns (e.g., `claim_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) to optimize performance. Additionally, consider the impact on the database server and run intensive queries during off-peak hours.

These queries aim to verify the anomalies by identifying patterns and deviations in the workflow. Analyzing the results can help determine underlying causes and inform process improvements or investigations into specific resources or claim types.
