**Rationale:**

- **Equivalence:** No activities are always executed the same number of times in every case, given the variability in orders.
- **Always Before:** Reflects the linear progression from receiving an order to dispatch, with specific dependencies (e.g., can't dispatch without previous steps).
- **Always After:** Indicates that certain activities (e.g., dispatch, invoicing) always happen after the initial order receipt, but not necessarily immediately after.
- **Never Together:** Ensures logical separation of beginning (order receipt) and end stages (dispatch, payment recording) of the process.
- **Activity Occurrences:** Each activity is expected to occur exactly once per order, assuming a straightforward, successful fulfillment process.
- **Directly Follows:** Defines the immediate sequence of activities for a smooth order fulfillment process, from order receipt through to payment recording.
