**High-Level Activity Derivation from Event Log: Manufacturing Workflow Aggregation**

---

###  **Overview**

Based on the analysis of repeated event sequences in cases A1 and B2, the low-level machine and operator events can be systematically grouped into meaningful, domain-relevant high-level manufacturing stages. These groupings are derived by identifying:

- Temporal proximity of events
- Logical dependencies between actions (e.g., actions performed to prepare materials for welding)
- The role of resources (e.g., Operator A performs initial preparation, Operator B performs welding)
- Functional coherence (e.g., all actions related to coating and drying grouped under "Finishing")

##  Proposed High-Level Activities

---

### **1. Material Preparation**

**Included Low-Level Events:**

| Activity                     | Resource         |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Retrieve raw metal sheet     | Operator A       |
| Scan barcode                 | Operator A       |
| Place metal sheet on table   | Operator A       |
| Align metal sheet            | Robot Arm #2     |
| Preheat metal sheet          | Heating Unit #1  |

** High-Level Step Name:** `Material Preparation`

** Rationale:**

- These events occur sequentially and serve the sole purpose of preparing the raw metal for assembly.
- Performed entirely at the start of production for each case.
- Involve foundational actions—identification (barcode), loading, precise positioning, and material conditioning.

### **2. Assembly & Welding**

**Included Low-Level Events:**

| Activity               | Resource     |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Pick up welding tool   | Operator B   |
| Weld corner A          | Operator B   |
| Weld corner B          | Operator B   |

** High-Level Step Name:** `Welding Assembly`

** Rationale:**

- These steps are all directly related to the structural assembly of the metal sheet.
- Lead by a single resource (Operator B).
- Tools are first retrieved, then welding is performed, which defines this as clearly distinct from preparation or finishing.

---

### **3. Quality Verification**

**Included Low-Level Events:**

| Activity                 | Resource          |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Measure weld integrity   | Quality Sensor #1 |

** High-Level Step Name:** `Weld Quality Inspection`

** Rationale:**

- Dedicated action evaluating the outcome of the welding process.
- Performed by a quality control sensor, distinct from assembly/production resources.
- Timed immediately after welding and prior to finishing — reinforcing its transitional quality assurance role.

---

### **4. Surface Finishing**

**Included Low-Level Events:**

| Activity                    | Resource          |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Apply protective coating   | Coating Unit #3   |
| Dry coating                | Heating Unit #2   |

** High-Level Step Name:** `Finishing`

** Rationale:**

- All actions involve surface treatment, which are aesthetically and functionally related.
- These steps transition the product from assembled to finished state.
- Exclusively involve automated or dedicated surface treatment units.

---

### **5. Final Inspection**

**Included Low-Level Events:**

| Activity         | Resource     |
|------------------|--------------|
| Visual check     | Operator C   |

** High-Level Step Name:** `Final Quality Check`

** Rationale:**

- Performed after all production steps are complete.
- Only quality evaluation step involving manual inspection.
- Acts as the final gate before product acceptance or shipment.

##  Structured High-Level Activity Mapping

Below is a holistic mapping for each case (shown using CaseID A1 for brevity):

###  **CaseID: A1**

| High-Level Activity      | Constituent Low-Level Activities                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Material Preparation** | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet |
| **Welding Assembly**     | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B                                               |
| **Weld Quality Inspection**   | Measure weld integrity                                                                         |
| **Finishing**            | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                                                            |
| **Final Quality Check**  | Visual check                                                                                     |

###  Summary of Proposed High-Level Steps in Order

1. **Material Preparation**
2. **Welding Assembly**
3. **Weld Quality Inspection**
4. **Finishing**
5. **Final Quality Check**

By structuring these complex low-level events into these larger process stages, we gain:

- **Improved process interpretability**
- **Streamlined monitoring and debugging**
- **Enhanced visualization for process mining & optimization tools**

This model is scalable to other similar logs across different cases (e.g., C3, D4, etc.) due to detected repeatability and consistency in task sequences.
