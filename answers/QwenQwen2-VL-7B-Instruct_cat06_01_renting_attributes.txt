The sensitive attributes for fairness are:

* Case: Gender
* Case: German Speaking
* Case: Married

These attributes are sensitive because they can be used to discriminate against certain groups of people. For example, if a real estate agent is more likely to offer a good deal to a man than a woman, then that would be considered unfair. Similarly, if a real estate agent is more likely to offer a good deal to a person who speaks German than a person who does not, then that would also be considered unfair. Finally, if a real estate agent is more likely to offer a good deal to a married person than a single person, then that would also be considered unfair.
