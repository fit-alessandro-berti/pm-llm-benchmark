1. How might supplier concentration in specific countries (e.g., microprocessors in Taiwan, screens in South Korea) affect the company’s vulnerability to geopolitical events, natural disasters, or trade restrictions, and what diversification strategies could mitigate those risks?

2. What trade-offs should the company consider when balancing just-in-time replenishment for high-demand markets against aggregated monthly shipments for slower markets, especially regarding cost, lead time variability, and risk of stockouts?

3. In what ways can the firm improve end-to-end visibility across suppliers, assembly plants, carriers, and distribution centers to enable faster, more accurate decision-making during disruptions?

4. How could predictive analytics and machine learning models be designed and governed to reduce forecast errors without amplifying biases from historical sales data or failing to account for sudden market shifts?

5. What quality assurance and supplier-performance metrics would be most effective to detect latent defects early (e.g., camera module degradation) and reduce the likelihood and scale of product recalls?

6. How should the company structure contractual terms, service-level agreements, and incentives with international suppliers and logistics partners to align on quality, lead times, flexibility, and sustainability goals?

7. What contingency plans and inventory buffers are appropriate for critical components with long lead times (e.g., microprocessors), and how should the company size those buffers while minimizing carrying costs?

8. How can manufacturing lines and workforce planning in the Malaysian plant be optimized to balance automation and human labor, maintain quality across 24/7 operations, and respond to demand variability?

9. What approaches could be taken to reduce the supply chain’s carbon footprint (materials sourcing, manufacturing, shipping modes, packaging) while considering cost and time-to-market constraints?

10. How might multi-currency exposures, varying tax/tariff regimes, and changing customs regulations impact cash flow and pricing strategies, and what financial hedging or operational strategies could mitigate these impacts?

11. In the event of supplier failure or component obsolescence, how should the company prioritize redesign, dual sourcing, or localized sourcing to preserve product timelines and margins?

12. What role could digital ledger technologies (e.g., blockchain) or IoT-based traceability play in improving provenance, compliance, anti-counterfeiting, and end-to-end accountability across the supply chain?

13. How should after-sales support, warranty processes, and spare-parts logistics be organized globally to minimize customer impact while controlling reverse-logistics costs?

14. Which regulatory and social compliance risks (environmental, labor, conflict minerals) are most likely to create reputational or legal exposure, and what monitoring/remediation frameworks will be effective across multiple jurisdictions?

15. How can the company design scenario-planning exercises and stress tests (e.g., semiconductor shortage, port closures, pandemic) to better understand knock-on effects and predefine response playbooks?

16. What metrics and governance processes should be in place to evaluate the ROI of continuous improvement initiatives aimed at reducing lead time, cost, or defect rates?

17. How could the company balance centralized global procurement versus regional procurement to optimize cost, responsiveness, and local regulatory compliance?

18. In what ways could carrier selection (air vs. sea, multimodal routing) be dynamically optimized to trade off speed, cost, emissions, and reliability for different markets and product launches?

19. How should product launches and pre-order strategies be coordinated with supply planning, supplier ramp-up, and logistics to avoid either overpromising or excessive inventory exposure?

20. What cybersecurity and data-governance safeguards are necessary to protect procurement, production scheduling, and logistics systems from attacks while maintaining the data sharing needed for collaboration with suppliers and partners?
