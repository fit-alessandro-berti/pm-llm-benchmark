Below is a practical, end-to-end plan to mine queues, pinpoint root causes, and implement targeted improvements for the clinic. It assumes a sixmonth event log with start/complete timestamps, resources, patient attributes, and activities comparable to your snippet.

1) Queue identification and characterization

How to compute “waiting time”
- What constitutes waiting: For a given patient visit, waiting time between activity X and activity Y is the time the patient is “ready” for Y but service for Y has not yet started.
- Operationalization from the log:
  - Activity service time (per activity): complete_time  start_time.
  - Enabling time for next activity:
    - If the process is a simple sequence X  Y, enabling_time(Y) = complete_time(X).
    - If Y requires multiple predecessors (e.g., nurse assessment and lab result), enabling_time(Y) = max(complete_time of all required predecessors). To identify prerequisites robustly, discover a controlflow model from the log (e.g., Inductive Miner) and use tokenbased replay to compute when Y becomes enabled.
  - Waiting time for Y: max(0, start_time(Y)  enabling_time(Y)). If Y starts before prior tasks complete (parallel flows), waiting is 0 for that edge.
- First queue in the visit:
  - If you have a scheduled appointment or checkin timestamp, waiting_before_registration = start_time(Registration)  min(appointment_time, checkin_time). If only the first activity is recorded, you cannot measure prearrival waiting.

Key queue metrics
Compute at three levels: per transition (X  Y), per activity “station” (e.g., Registration desk, Nurse pool, Cardio consult), and per resource (e.g., Dr. Smith, Room 3).
- Waiting time metrics:
  - Mean, median, 75th/90th/95th percentile, max (to capture tail behavior).
  - SLA breach rate: % of cases with wait > target (e.g., Reg <10 min, Nurse <15, Doctor <20, Imaging <30).
  - Excess wait hours: sum over cases of max(0, wait  SLA), useful to rank queues by total “pain.”
- Frequency metrics:
  - Number and share of visits experiencing the queue.
  - Queue incidence by patient type (New vs Followup, Urgent vs Normal), day of week, hour of day.
- Capacity and variability metrics (per station/pool):
  - Arrival rate (t) (timeofday), Interarrival CV (ca).
  - Service time E[S], CV of service time (cs), by patient type and resource.
  - Utilization  = workload/capacity over time (e.g., ·E[S]/servers), and time at >85%.
  - Average queue length Lq(t) reconstructed from arrivals to “enabled” and service starts.
- Flow metrics:
  - Doortodoor time; share of time waiting vs being served.
  - Bottleneck index: waiting time share at each stage.

Identifying the most critical queues
- Rank queues using a composite criticality score:
  - C = (total excess wait hours) × (number of affected visits) × (patient impact weight).
  - Patient impact weight can be higher for clinical risk (Urgent), firstimpression steps (Registration), and scarce resources (Doctor, Imaging).
- Also flag:
  - Queues with high 90th/95th percentile (poor tail performance).
  - Queues that dominate doortodoor time contribution.
  - Queues disproportionately affecting vulnerable cohorts (e.g., New, Urgent).
- Visuals to use:
  - Heatmaps of median/90th percentile waits by hour/day.
  - Directlyfollows graph annotated with median and 90th percentile waits on edges.
  - Resource pools annotated with utilization and wait percentiles.

2) Root cause analysis

Use the event log to go beyond “where” and probe “why.”
- Resource bottlenecks
  - Compute utilization by pool/resource over time. Persistent high  (e.g., >85%) during peaks typically explains long waits (Kingman’s formula shows Wq grows nonlinearly as 1).
  - Crosscompare pools: if Nurse throughput >> Doctor capacity in the same period, patients accumulate waiting for doctors.
- Activity dependencies and handovers
  - Handoverofwork network: identify transitions with long waits where different roles are involved (e.g., Nurse  ECG Tech). Long waits after handovers often point to coordination gaps or batching.
  - Join waits: when a doctor review waits on multiple tests, compute the time from last test completion to doctor start; large waits here indicate synchronization issues or scheduling misalignment.
- Variability in service times
  - Estimate E[S] and cs by activity and patient segment. High cs inflates queueing delay; mixing New and Followup in one doctor template often increases cs.
  - Overtaking: cases served out of arrival order; investigate priority rules (e.g., Urgent preemption) and fairness.
- Appointment scheduling policies and arrival patterns
  - Plot arrivals by time slot; “topofhour” spikes cause transient overload even when average capacity is adequate.
  - Noshow and latearrival analysis: quantify effective arrival variability; identify specialties with systematic late running that cascade delays.
- Equipment/room constraints
  - For imaging/labs, compute stationlevel , room downtime, changeover/setup time between test types.
- Differences by patient type/urgency
  - Variant analysis: compare typical paths and timings for New vs Followup, Urgent vs Normal.
  - Conformance checking: identify nonstandard paths where exceptional routing (e.g., extra tests) creates unexpected waits.
- Databacked tools and techniques
  - Process discovery + tokenbased replay to compute exact enabling times and synchronization delays.
  - Bottleneck analysis (sojourn decomposed into wait vs service by station).
  - Arrival/service distribution fitting and queueing approximations (e.g., G/G/s via AllenCunneen) and discreteevent simulation to test scenarios safely.

3) Datadriven optimization strategies

Strategy A: Capacityaligned scheduling and smoothing of arrivals
- Target queues: Registration at open and topofhour, Nurse assessment midmorning peaks, specific Doctor pools with high , imaging queues following common consults (e.g., Cardio  ECG).
- Root cause addressed: Transient overload from lumpy appointment templates; mismatch between upstream throughput and downstream capacity.
- Data support:
  - Heatmaps showing spikes in arrivals and >85% during specific 15–30 min windows.
  - High 90th percentile wait increasing during those spikes.
- What to do:
  - Cap concurrent starts per station: set appointment slot quotas per 15minute bin based on observed , E[S], cs, and number of servers. Aim for peak   80–85%.
  - Stagger templates across roles: offset nurse starts by 10 min from registration peaks; offset imaging slots relative to likely ordering times.
  - Segment slot lengths: longer slots for New, shorter for Followup; create dedicated “urgent flex” buffers every hour.
  - Predictive overbooking only where noshow risk is high; avoid on stations already near capacity.
- Expected impact:
  - Using queueing approximations, reducing peak  from ~95% to ~85% can reduce Wq by 30–60% at affected stations. If Nurse assessment median wait is 18 min with 90th at 40, expect 25–40% reduction in median and 30–50% in 90th percentile during peaks.

Strategy B: Dynamic crosscoverage and microrebalancing of staff
- Target queues: Registration and Checkout at shift changes; ECG/Xray during midday clumps; specific doctors’ queues when a provider runs late.
- Root cause addressed: Short, predictable demand surges and variability; singlepoint resource bottlenecks.
- Data support:
  - Short highwait intervals cooccurring with staff breaks or predictable referral waves from certain clinics; resourcelevel utilization traces show idle capacity in adjacent pools.
- What to do:
  - Create a float role trained across two adjacent functions (e.g., Clerk, ECG tech) scheduled into 15–30 min “hot windows” identified by the heatmap.
  - Implement a live “queue health” dashboard (current Lq, 90th percentile wait over last 30 min) with rules to trigger crosscoverage or call a standby.
  - For doctors, add a shared “swing” PA/NP to handle quick followups or result reviews when  spikes.
- Expected impact:
  - When short surges are covered, peak waits can drop 20–40%. For example, if Checkout 90th percentile is 25 min at 4–5 pm, adding a crosscover clerk during that hour can halve the tail, with minimal added hours (0.5–1.0 FTE spread).

Strategy C: Parallelization and preauthorization of likely downstream tests
- Target queues: Nurse  Imaging (e.g., ECG), Consult  Lab/Xray  Consultreview.
- Root cause addressed: Synchronization waits and rework when tests are ordered late; doctors waiting on results.
- Data support:
  - Tokenbased replay shows long waits for Doctor Review after all tests complete; variant analysis reveals that for specific diagnoses/symptoms, tests are almost always ordered postconsult with high downstream waits.
- What to do:
  - Standing orders: allow nurses to preorder ECGs or basic labs for defined symptom clusters (e.g., chest pain protocol) before doctor consult.
  - For predictable specialties, schedule “previsit” labs for New patients the day before; or earlyinvisit ECG while waiting for doctor.
  - Enable mobile phlebotomy or inroom ECG to remove transport and room waits.
- Expected impact:
  - By moving test ordering upstream and overlapping with other waits, you can eliminate a full queue cycle. Typical reductions: 15–30 minutes on “Consult  Test  Review” path and 20–40% reduction in doortodoor for those cohorts, with fewer consult interruptions.

Strategy D: Streamlined frontend and backend tasks via digital intake and distributed checkout
- Target queues: Registration and Checkout.
- Root cause addressed: Long service times (E[S]) and high cs from manual data entry, payment, and scheduling.
- Data support:
  - Service time analysis shows heavy tails for Registration and Checkout, especially in New patients.
- What to do:
  - eCheckin within 48 hours before visit (demographics, insurance, consent, copay), kiosks for arrivals, preauth verification done offpeak.
  - At checkout, enable inroom scheduling and eprescription finalization before the patient leaves the consult room; payment links sent digitally to reduce counter load.
- Expected impact:
  - If you reduce E[S] by 20–30% and cs by 10–20%, queueing delay drops disproportionately. Expect 25–50% reduction in registration/checkout waits, especially at peaks.

Strategy E: Template redesign for provider mix and duration variability
- Target queues: Doctor consultations in highmix clinics.
- Root cause addressed: High servicetime variability (cs) from mixing New and Followup and complex cases in same blocks.
- Data support:
  - Service time distributions show cs for mixed blocks >1.0 versus ~0.5–0.7 when separated.
- What to do:
  - Create distinct session blocks: Newheavy blocks with fewer per hour; Followup blocks with more per hour; reserve short “quickhit” slots to absorb variance.
  - Pair providers: physician + PA/NP to handle documentation, refills, and result reviews in parallel.
- Expected impact:
  - Lower cs drives down Wq. Typical 15–30% reduction in median and tail waits in doctor consult queues; overall doortodoor improvements of 10–20% for affected clinics.

How to quantify the benefit before rollout
- Use fitted arrival and service distributions per station (by hour/day, patient type), current servers, and routing probabilities.
- Run discreteevent simulations (PM4Py, SimPy, or commercial tools) to compare baseline vs proposed scenarios and predict changes in 50th/90th percentile waits, doortodoor, and utilization.

4) Tradeoffs and constraints

- Shifting the bottleneck: Smoothing arrivals to doctors might increase waits at Registration if templates are not coordinated endtoend. Mitigation: codesign slot caps across Registration  Nurse  Doctor  Diagnostics.
- Cost vs benefit: Extra float coverage or added equipment hours cost money. Start with microcoverage during the worst 5–10 hours/week identified by heatmaps; reevaluate with ROI after 4–6 weeks.
- Clinical appropriateness: Preordering tests risks unnecessary utilization. Use narrowly defined protocols, physician oversight, and periodic audit of positive yield.
- Staff workload and burnout: Crosscoverage and tighter templates can increase cognitive load. Build predictable rotations, protect breaks, and monitor utilization to keep  < 85% sustained.
- Digital divide: eCheckin may disadvantage some patients. Keep assisted options (kiosks with staff support), multiple languages, and accessibility features.
- Equity and fairness: Priority for Urgent should not create chronic delays for routine care. Track percohort KPIs and tune priority rules.
- Change management: New workflows (standing orders, distributed checkout) require training, policy updates, and EHR configuration; stage rollouts.

5) Measuring success

KPIs to track postimplementation
- Patient time metrics:
  - Doortodoor visit duration (median, 90th percentile).
  - Waiting time per stage and per critical transition (median, 90th, SLA breach rate).
  - Share of visit time spent waiting vs being served.
- Flow and access:
  - Throughput per clinic/session; ontime start rate for appointments; laterunning sessions.
  - Leftwithoutbeingseen/leftbeforecheckout rates (if applicable).
- Resource metrics:
  - Utilization by station and resource; time at >85%; overtime hours.
  - Rework loops and return visits for incomplete tasks.
- Quality and experience:
  - Patient satisfaction (overall and “waiting time” question), complaints about waits.
  - Safety/quality proxies (e.g., turnaround time for critical results, adherence to protocols).
- Equity:
  - Wait differentials by patient type, language, insurance, and urgency.

Ongoing monitoring approach
- Nearrealtime queue dashboard:
  - Current queue length Lq and rolling 30–60 min wait percentiles by station; alerts when SLA breach rate exceeds threshold.
- Weekly process mining review:
  - Directlyfollows map with updated wait annotations; heatmaps by hour/day; cohort splits (New/Followup, Urgent).
  - Control charts for key waits (e.g., Doctor 90th percentile) to detect drift.
- A/B or phased rollout evaluation:
  - Differenceindifferences: pilot clinics vs controls; pre/post comparisons adjusted for seasonality.
- Continuous optimization:
  - Refit arrival/service distributions monthly; retune slot caps and crosscoverage windows.
  - Postimplementation conformance checks to ensure new protocols (standing orders, distributed checkout) are followed and effective.

Implementation roadmap (condensed)
- Weeks 1–2: Clean and enrich the event log; discover process model; compute enabling times and baseline queue metrics; identify top 3–5 critical queues using the composite criticality score.
- Weeks 3–4: Root cause deepdives (utilization, variability, scheduling patterns); design interventions; run simulations to estimate impact.
- Weeks 5–8: Pilot Strategy A (scheduling smoothing) and one of B/C in the most affected specialty; stand up live queue dashboard.
- Weeks 9–12: Evaluate KPIs; refine; scale to additional clinics; introduce Strategy D/E as needed.

By combining rigorous queue mining (accurate waiting time measurement, utilization and variability analysis) with targeted operational changes validated via simulation, the clinic can reduce peak waits materially, improve overall visit durations, and elevate patient experience with limited incremental cost.
