After analyzing the process variants and their execution times, I've identified some potential differences in treatment between the protected and unprotected groups. Keep in mind that I'll rely on domain knowledge and general assumptions, as the specific context and details aren't provided.

1. **Registration process**: Protected group:
	* More variants involve registration at ER (Emergency Room) compared to FD (Another Facility).
	* Unprotected group:
		+ More variants involve registration at FD.
		+ Variant "Discharge" ( frequency = 505 ) without preceding registration steps suggests a possible streamlined process for the unprotected group.
2. **Examination variants**:
	* Protected group:
		+ More variants involve incomplete or unsuccessful examinations (e.g., "Examination -> Diagnosis ->...").
		+ A higher number of variants include Expert Examination and Thorough Examination, which might indicate a more cautious or detailed approach.
	* Unprotected group:
		+ More variants involve successful examinations (incomplete or unsuccessful examination steps are fewer).
		+ Variant "Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination ->..." appears more frequently, indicating a consistent, thorough approach.
3. **Outcome differences**:
	* Protected group:
		+ A higher number of variants involve Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge, suggesting additional steps might be taken to recover from initial treatment failures.
	* Unprotected group:
		+ A higher number of variants involve successful treatments without extensive additional steps (e.g., "Treatment successful -> Discharge").
4. **Thorough Examination frequency**:
	* Protected group: 22 variants involve Thorough Examination.
	* Unprotected group: 15 variants involve Thorough Examination.
5. **Treatment successful -> Discharge variants**:
	* Protected group: 21 variants involve Treatment successful -> Discharge.
	* Unprotected group: 35 variants involve Treatment successful -> Discharge.

Given these observations, some potential differences in the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups are:

* The protected group seems to have a more varied and cautious approach, with a higher number of incomplete or unsuccessful examination steps and a more complex recovery process from initial treatment failures.
* The unprotected group appears to have a more streamlined and consistent process, with fewer incomplete or unsuccessful examination steps and a simpler recovery process from initial treatment failures.
* The unprotected group has a higher number of variants involving successful treatments and fewer variants involving internal loops (e.g., treatment unsuccessful -> diagnosis -> treatment ->...).

Please note that these differences are inferred from the
