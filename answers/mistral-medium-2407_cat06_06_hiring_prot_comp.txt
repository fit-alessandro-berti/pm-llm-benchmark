Based on the provided data, the main differences in treatment between the protected and unprotected groups can be observed in the frequency and performance of various process variants. Here are some notable differences:

1. Frequency of registration: The frequency of registration at the ER and FD is significantly lower for the protected group compared to the unprotected group. For example, the frequency of registration at the ER for the protected group is 158, while it is 1418 for the unprotected group. Similarly, the frequency of registration at the FD for the protected group is 156, while it is 1466 for the unprotected group.
2. Frequency of successful treatment: The frequency of successful treatment is higher for the protected group compared to the unprotected group. For instance, the most frequent process variant for the protected group is "Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a frequency of 284, while the most frequent process variant for the unprotected group is "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a frequency of 1466. However, the protected group has a higher number of successful treatments overall.
3. Performance of process variants: The performance of process variants varies between the two groups. For example, the process variant "Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a performance of 260001.236 for the protected group and 260005.208 for the unprotected group. Similarly, the process variant "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a performance of 320004.432 for the unprotected group, while the protected group has multiple variants with similar performance, such as "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a performance of 260008.950.
4. Frequency of treatment failure: The frequency of treatment failure is higher for the unprotected group compared to the protected group. For instance, the process variant "Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a frequency of 48 for the protected group and 225 for the unprotected group.
5. Frequency of discharge without treatment: The frequency of discharge without treatment is higher for the unprotected group compared to the protected group. For example, the process variant "Discharge" has a frequency of 0 for the protected group and 505 for the unprotected group.

Overall, the data suggests that there are differences in the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups, with the protected group having a higher frequency of successful treatment and lower frequency of treatment failure. However, it is important to note that the reasons for these differences are not explicitly stated in the provided data, and further investigation would be needed to determine if these differences are due to unfair treatment or other factors.
