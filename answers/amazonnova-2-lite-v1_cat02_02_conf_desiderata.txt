### **Analysis of the Event Log**

---

## **1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Rules)**

Normative rules are **strict** — violating them indicates a serious deviation from the required process. Let's examine each case for compliance with the normative constraints.

---

### **Case 1**
**Timeline:**
- 2024-01-10 09:00 – Application Received  
- 2024-01-10 09:30 – Credit Check  
- 2024-01-10 10:00 – Risk Assessment  
- 2024-01-10 11:00 – Loan Decision (Approved)  
- 2024-01-10 13:00 – Inform Applicant  
- 2024-01-10 13:30 – Finalize Documentation  
- 2024-01-10 14:00 – Close Case  

 **Compliant with Normative Rules**

- Follows the correct sequence: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
- All required steps are present and in the correct order.
- After an **approved** decision, documentation is finalized **before** closing.
- No contradictions or skipped steps.

---

### **Case 2**
**Timeline:**
- 2024-01-11 08:00 – Application Received  
- 2024-01-11 08:20 – Risk Assessment *(No prior Credit Check — violation!)*
- 2024-01-11 09:00 – Credit Check  
- 2024-01-11 09:30 – Loan Decision (Rejected)  
- 2024-01-11 10:00 – Finalize Documentation *(Violation: Not allowed after a rejection!)*
- 2024-01-11 10:30 – Close Case  

 **Severe Violations of Normative Rules**

1. **Credit Check performed *after* Risk Assessment**  
   - **Constraint Violation**: Credit Check must occur **before** Risk Assessment.
   - **Impact**: This breaks the defined sequence and may indicate flawed data or logic in the process.

2. **Finalize Documentation after a Rejected Loan**  
   - **Constraint Violation**: If the loan is rejected, **do not finalize documentation** before closing the case.
   - **Impact**: This is a **clear violation** of the normative logic and could lead to unnecessary work or errors.

**Conclusion for Case 2**: **This case **_violates strict normative rules_** and should be flagged as non-compliant.

### **Case 3**
**Timeline:**
- 2024-01-12 09:00 – Application Received  
- 2024-01-14 10:00 – Credit Check  
- 2024-01-14 11:00 – Risk Assessment  
- 2024-01-14 12:00 – Loan Decision (Approved)  
- 2024-01-16 15:00 – Inform Applicant  
- 2024-01-17 09:00 – Finalize Documentation  
- 2024-01-17 10:00 – Close Case  
- *(No Follow-up Call)*  

 **Compliant with Normative Rules**

- All required steps are present and in the correct order.
- After an **approved** decision, documentation is finalized **before** closing.
- No violations of sequence or contradictory actions.

**Note**: The **timing of Credit Check** and **Inform Applicant** is delayed beyond recommended windows — but this is a **desideratum**, not a normative violation.

---

## **2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended but Not Strict)**

Desiderata are **recommended best practices**, not mandatory. Violating them is **not a serious error**, but it indicates suboptimal performance.

Let’s evaluate each case:

---

### **Case 1**
- Credit Check done within 30 minutes of application.
- Inform Applicant done within 2 hours of decision.
- No Follow-up Call.

 **Compliant with Desiderata (timing-wise)**  
 **Missing Follow-up Call** — a **desideratum violation** (optional best practice not followed)

**Note**: Timing is excellent, but the **absence of a Follow-up Call** is a minor deviation from best practice.

---

### **Case 2**
- Credit Check delayed until **after** Risk Assessment — **not a desideratum issue** (this is a **normative violation**).
- Finalize Documentation after rejection — **normative violation**, not desiderata.

 **No desiderata evaluation needed** — this case fails **normative rules**, so desiderata are irrelevant.

---

### **Case 3**
**Desiderata Violations:**

1. **Credit Check completed more than 24 hours after application**
   - Application Received: 2024-01-12 09:00  
   - Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00  **~48+ hours later**
   - **Desideratum**: Credit Check should be completed **within 24 hours** of application.

2. **Inform Applicant completed more than 48 hours after Loan Decision**
   - Loan Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00  
   - Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00  **~56 hours later**
   - **Desideratum**: Inform Applicant should be done **within 48 hours** of decision.

3. **No Follow-up Call**  
   - A recommended best practice — **missing** in this case.

 **Desiderata Summary for Case 3**:  
- **3 desiderata violations**: Delayed Credit Check, Delayed Inform Applicant, Missing Follow-up Call.

These are **not severe**, but they indicate **inefficiencies** and **lack of best-practice adherence**.

## **3. Interpretations and Justifications**

### **Case 2: Severe Normative Violations**

**Possible Interpretations / Justifications:**

1. **Data Entry or System Error**:
   - The Risk Assessment may have been logged prematurely due to a system glitch or human error. The Credit Check could have been performed earlier but mislogged.
   - **Action Needed**: Audit the system logs or interview staff to verify actual timing and sequence.

2. **Misunderstanding of Process Logic**:
   - The operator may have believed Risk Assessment could begin before the Credit Check, perhaps due to incomplete training or ambiguous SOPs.
   - **Action Needed**: Retrain staff on the strict sequence: **Credit Check  Risk Assessment**.

3. **Automation or Workflow Misconfiguration**:
   - If this is an automated system, a rule may have been misconfigured to allow Risk Assessment without a Credit Check.
   - **Action Needed**: Review and correct workflow logic in the system.

4. **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**:
   - This is a **clear breach** of logic. Possible reasons:
     - An employee mistakenly finalized docs thinking the loan was approved.
     - A bug in the system that auto-finalizes documents regardless of decision.
   - **Action Needed**: Investigate root cause and implement checks to prevent this in future.

---

### **Case 3: Desiderata Violations**

**Possible Interpretations / Justifications:**

1. **Workload or Resource Constraints**:
   - TheCredit Check may have been delayed due to backlog or limited staffing in the credit department.
   - **Recommendation**: Monitor workload and consider resource allocation to meet desiderata timelines.

2. **Communication Delays**:
   - The delay in informing the applicant may be due to:
     - Internal approval bottlenecks.
     - Difficulty reaching the applicant (e.g., wrong contact info).
   - **Recommendation**: Implement follow-up reminders and alternative contact methods.

3. **Follow-up Call Omission**:
   - The follow-up call may have been skipped due to:
     - Time constraints.
     - Perception that it is low-priority.
     - Lack of clear accountability for this step.
   - **Recommendation**: Make the follow-up call a required checkpoint in the workflow or assign ownership to a specific role.

## **Summary Table**

| Case ID | Normative Violations | Desiderata Violations | Overall Compliance |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **1**   |  None                |  Timing OK<br> No Follow-up Call |  Compliant (minor desiderata issue) |
| **2**   |  Credit Check after Risk Assessment<br> Finalize Documentation after Rejection | N/A (normative failure overrides) |  **Severe Violation** |
| **3**   |  None                |  Credit Check >24h<br> Inform Applicant >48h<br> No Follow-up Call |  Compliant (desiderata not met) |

## **Recommendations**

### **For Case 2 (Severe Violations):**
- **Immediate correction**: Do not close the case until the process is fixed.
- **Root cause analysis**: Investigate why Credit Check was delayed and why documentation was finalized after rejection.
- **Process redesign**: Ensure workflow enforces sequence (e.g., via IT system rules or checklists).
- **Training**: Reinforce the strict normative sequence with staff.

### **For All Cases (Desiderata Improvements):**
- **Implement automated timers** to alert when Credit Check or Inform Applicant steps are overdue.
- **Introduce Follow-up Call as a required step** in the workflow, with ownership assigned.
- **Dashboard monitoring** to track desiderata compliance (e.g., % of cases meeting 24-hour Credit Check SLA).
- **Reward or recognize** teams that consistently meet desiderata, to promote a culture of timeliness and care.

### **Final Note:**
While desiderata violations are not critical, repeatedly missing them can erode customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Combining strict normative adherence with strong desiderata performance leads to a **robust, customer-centric loan process**.
