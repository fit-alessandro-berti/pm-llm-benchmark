Certainly! Here's an alternative focus on process mining, as well as a broader concept that encompasses the same underlying principles:

### Alternative Focus: **Process Decomposition**

#### Explanation:
Process decomposition is the reverse of automated process discovery. Instead of discovering hidden patterns in existing processes to uncover their structure or efficiency, it involves breaking down complex systems and procedures into simpler, more understandable components.

**Key Principles:**
- **Simplification**: The objective is to make large, intricate processes easier to manage by decomposing them into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Reusability**: Decomposed elements can be reused in different contexts, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.
- **Understanding**: By breaking down complex systems, the underlying structures and interactions become clearer, aiding in decision-making and optimization.

### Broader Concept: **Process Engineering**

#### Explanation:
While process mining focuses on automating the discovery of processes from data, process engineering is a more comprehensive discipline that encompasses both process discovery (process mining) and process decomposition. It aims to enhance process understanding, optimize process performance, and improve overall system efficiency through systematic approaches.

**Key Principles:**
- **Systematic Approaches**: Uses models, diagrams, and statistical techniques to represent, analyze, and optimize processes.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Involves ongoing monitoring, learning from historical data, and continuous improvement initiatives.
- **Integration of Data and Knowledge**: Combines process mining insights with domain knowledge for more informed decision-making.

By focusing on these concepts, we can see that the field of process mining is part of a larger framework designed to enhance organizational performance through systematic and analytical methods.
