Certainly! Here’s an opposing concept for each listed approach in process mining:
1. Automated Process Discovery: This is directly opposite to automated process discovery because the goal of manually identifying processes involves explicitly and deliberately searching through available historical data or documentation.

2. Predictive Monitoring: Prediction, by definition, deals with the future not just the present. Therefore, predicting what isn’t yet observed but could happen in the future would be a broader concept that diverges from monitoring focused on current events.

3. Bottom-up Discovery vs Top-down Discovery: Generally speaking, bottom-up discovery is inherently less structured and likely to require more human intervention compared to top-down approaches.
   - **Bottom-Up Disambiguation:** When applying computational methods or tools for process mining to extract data that the process analysts have not necessarily been trained to identify. Bottom-up includes approaches like "discovering” all events in a dataset, as opposed to deriving only those that are deemed significant by domain experts.

4. Process Simulation vs Human Simulation: Simulations are typically used when predicting outcomes or evaluating the consequences of decisions within existing processes. In process mining, simulations are about using historical records without attempting to generate new data scenarios.
   - **Process Mining Does Not Result in New Data Scenarios**: As opposed to creating a controlled scenario for human simulations, processing and studying various potential future events through observed past activities is key instead.

5. Process Efficiency vs Optimization: Process efficiency usually implies that resources can be utilized effectively without increasing the output costs, whereas optimization addresses how an optimal path results from selecting better inputs or outputs within constrained conditions.
   - **Process Mining Focusing On Pathways and Resources**: It focuses on finding efficient processes rather than optimizing a single input-output point.

6. Real-time Monitoring vs Historical Data Analysis: The process mining field inherently deals with the historical data contained in logs, reports, etc., whereas real-time monitoring involves processing that information in real time as it happens.
   - **Process Mining Analyzing Static Log Records for Future Actions**: This contrasts to real-time monitoring where the analysis must be applied instantaneously within any event or transaction.

I hope this differentiation helps!
