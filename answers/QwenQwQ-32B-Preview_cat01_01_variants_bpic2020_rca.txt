To identify the root causes of performance issues in this process, we need to analyze the process variants and their associated frequencies and performances. Here are some observations and potential root causes based on the provided data:

1. **Long Paths with Multiple Rejections:**
   - Several process variants involve multiple rejections and resubmissions, which can significantly increase the overall performance time.
   - For example:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
     - This path has a high performance value (1604595.638), suggesting that the multiple rejections and resubmissions lead to longer processing times.

2. **Involvement of Multiple Approvers:**
   - Process variants that involve approvals from multiple roles (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR) tend to have higher performance times.
   - For example:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
     - This path has a higher performance value (1084338.407) compared to paths with fewer approval steps.

3. **Missing Approvals or Rejections:**
   - Some variants include steps like "REJECTED by MISSING" or "FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING."
   - These steps might indicate delays or issues in the approval process, leading to performance bottlenecks.

4. **Pre-Approval Steps:**
   - Variants involving pre-approval by PRE_APPROVER also have higher performance times.
   - For example:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
     - This path has a performance value of 861058.409, which is higher than some other paths without pre-approval.

5. **Direct Approval Paths:**
   - Paths with direct approval from EMPLOYEE to SUPERVISOR without intermediate approvals have relatively lower performance times.
   - For example:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
     - This path has a performance value of 854633.975, which is lower compared to paths with multiple approval steps.

6. **High Performance in Specific Variants:**
   - Some variants with higher frequencies have higher performance values, indicating potential bottlenecks.
   - For example:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
     - Frequency: 4618, Performance: 810187.903
     - This suggests that even with a high frequency, the process takes a significant amount of time.

7. **Rejected Declarations:**
   - Variants where declarations are rejected multiple times before final approval have very high performance values.
   - For example:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
     - Frequency: 188, Performance: 2061236.516
     - This indicates that repeated rejections and resubmissions are causing significant delays.

8. **Saved Declarations:**
   - Declarations that are saved but not submitted have a performance value of 0.000, which might not directly impact performance but could indicate incomplete or abandoned processes.

9. **Complex Rejection Paths:**
   - Some rejection paths involve multiple levels of rejection and resubmission, leading to extended processing times.
   - For example:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
     - Frequency: 29, Performance: 2790977.310
     - This complex path results in very high performance times.

**Potential Root Causes:**

- **Insufficient Initial Review:** Declarations may not be thoroughly reviewed before submission, leading to rejections and subsequent resubmissions.
- **Lack of Clear Guidelines:** Employees may not have clear guidelines on what constitutes an acceptable declaration, leading to repeated rejections.
- **Inefficient Approval Workflow:** The involvement of multiple approvers may lead to delays if there are bottlenecks at any approval stage.
- **Missing or Unavailable Approvers:** "REJECTED by MISSING" steps may indicate that approvers are unavailable or not promptly reviewing declarations.
- **Pre-Approval Steps Adding Delays:** Pre-approval steps may introduce unnecessary delays if they are not streamlined.
- **Data Entry Errors:** Errors in data entry could lead to rejections and require resubmissions, increasing overall processing time.
- **System Delays:** Delays in the system for processing declarations or notifications could contribute to longer performance times.

To address these issues, consider the following actions:

- **Improve Training and Guidelines:** Provide clearer guidelines and training for employees to reduce the number of rejections.
- **Streamline Approval Workflow:** Review and optimize the approval process to minimize the number of steps and potential bottlenecks.
- **Ensure Availability of Approvers:** Make sure that approvers are available and promptly review declarations to avoid delays.
- **Automate Where Possible:** Automate initial reviews or use validation tools to catch errors before submissions.
- **Monitor and Optimize Pre-Approval Steps:** Ensure that pre-approval steps are necessary and efficient.
- **Enhance System Performance:** Optimize the system to reduce processing and notification times.

By focusing on these areas, you can identify and mitigate the root causes of performance issues in the process.
