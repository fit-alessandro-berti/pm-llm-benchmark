### 1. Identify cases with significantly longer lead times

- **Calculate durations for each case:**  
  Lead time = Time between **Submit Claim** and **Close Claim** events.

| Case ID | Submit Claim         | Close Claim          | Duration (approx)               |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30     | 1h 30m                         |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00     | ~26 hours                     |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30     | ~48 hours 20 minutes          |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45     | 1h 25m                        |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30     | ~75 hours 5 minutes           |

Clearly, **cases 2003 and 2005** exhibit significantly longer processing times. Case 2002 also took longer than others but less than 2003 and 2005.

### 2. Attribute Analysis (Resource, Region, Complexity)

#### **Complexity:**
- Short duration cases (2001, 2004) have **Low** complexity.
- Medium duration case (2002) has **Medium** complexity.
- Long duration cases (2003, 2005) have **High** complexity.

Observation:  
- **High complexity claims consistently result in longer durations.**

#### **Region:**
- Region A cases: 2001 (Low), 2003 (High)
- Region B cases: 2002 (Medium), 2004 (Low), 2005 (High)

Observation:  
- Both regions handle high-complexity cases, but case 2003 (Region A, High) and 2005 (Region B, High) both have long durations. Thus, region alone is **not a definitive cause**.  
- However, Region B has a mix of complexity but still longer cases with higher complexity.

#### **Resource:**

- **Requests for Additional Documents:**  
  - Case 2002 (Medium): 1 request  
  - Case 2003 (High): 3 requests, all handled by **Adjuster_Mike**  
  - Case 2005 (High): 4 requests, all handled by **Adjuster_Lisa**

- **Evaluators / Adjusters:**  
  - Case 2003: Adjuster_Mike (A region) illustrates repeated document requests causing delays.  
  - Case 2005: Adjuster_Lisa (B region) is repeatedly requesting additional documents and the case takes the longest.

- **Managers:**  
  - Manager_Ann handles cases 2001, 2002, 2004 (Low and Medium complexity, shorter durations)  
  - Manager_Bill handles cases 2003, 2005 (High complexity, longer durations)

Observation:  
- Cases with longer durations involve **multiple "Request Additional Documents" steps**, handled by specific adjusters (Mike in Region A and Lisa in Region B).  
- Managers differ by region and seem involved in longer cases in case of Manager_Bill.

### 3. Explanation of Root Causes and Mitigation Suggestions

#### Root Causes:
- **High complexity claims require multiple rounds of additional documentation**, significantly increasing lead times.  
- **Specific adjusters (Mike and Lisa)** are managing these high-complexity cases and appear to request additional documents multiple times, potentially due to detailed scrutiny or inefficiencies.  
- **Manager_Bill’s approvals** coincide with longer processing times, possibly due to case complexity or managerial bottlenecks.  
- Region alone is less indicative but there may be slight variations due to differences in case handling practices or resource availability between regions.

#### Why these factors contribute to delays:
- **High complexity** demands thorough examination, often unveiling missing or unclear information, necessitating repeated document requests.  
- **Adjusters’ workload or approach:** Multiple requests by the same adjusters might reflect a conservative review style or workload management issues.  
- **Managerial delays:** Late approvals by Manager_Bill may indicate prioritization or decision bottlenecks during busy periods for complicated claims.  

#### Mitigation Suggestions:
1. **Streamline document requests:**  
   - Implement better pre-evaluation checks to reduce multiple rounds of document requests.  
   - Provide clearer guidelines or checklists for required documents upfront.  

2. **Training / process standardization for adjusters:**  
   - Assess the causes behind repeated document requests by Adjusters Mike and Lisa.  
   - Train them to better identify documents needed early and reduce back-and-forth.  
   - Possibly balance workload or add peer review to improve efficiency.  

3. **Manager approval process improvement:**  
   - Investigate Manager_Bill’s approval delays and optimize workflow, perhaps by delegating authority or improving decision support systems for complex claims.  

4. **Region-level best practice sharing:**  
   - Share successful faster processing practices from Region A or B (e.g., from cases 2001, 2004) to high-performing teams to promote efficiency across both regions.

### **Summary:**

| Factor                  | Impact                                | Suggested Action                              |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| High complexity claims  | Long durations, multiple document requests | Better upfront screening, clearer document requirements |
| Specific adjusters (Mike, Lisa) | Multiple requests prolong cases | Training, workload assessment, peer reviews   |
| Manager_Bill’s approvals | Potential bottleneck in high complexity cases | Process optimization, delegation, decision support |
| Regions (A vs B)         | Minor impact, procedural differences | Encourage best practice sharing               |

If these root causes are addressed, the insurance claims process can be more efficient, especially for complex claims, reducing lead times and improving customer satisfaction.
