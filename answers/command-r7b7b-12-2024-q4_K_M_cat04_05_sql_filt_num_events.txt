```sql
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Subquery:** The subquery `(SELECT case_id ...)` first groups the events by `case_id` using the `GROUP BY` clause.
2. **Aggregation:** It then counts the number of events for each `case_id` using the `COUNT(*)` function.
3. **Filtering:** The `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` clause filters this subquery to only include `case_id` values where the event count is six or fewer.

4. **Main Query:** The main query selects all columns from the `event_log` table but only for those rows whose `case_id` appears in the results of the subquery (i.e., cases with 6 or fewer events).
