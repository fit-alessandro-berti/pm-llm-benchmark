Here's an analysis of the process variants between the protected and unprotected groups, identifying potential unfair differences:

### 1. **Frequency of Rejections Early in the Process:**
   - **Protected Group:** 
     - Early rejection (Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant) has a frequency of 484.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Early rejection has a lower frequency (365), but a higher total frequency when considering all forms of rejections early in the process (Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant at 674 + 365).

   **Observation:** The unprotected group seems to face rejection more frequently after viewing the property, which might suggest a bias or stricter criteria applied after initial interactions.

### 2. **Screening and Extensive Screening:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - More frequent use of extensive screening before rejection (793 instances with performance of 540011.977).
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Less frequent use of extensive screening (1022 instances with performance of 480013.530), but still significant.

   **Observation:** The protected group undergoes more extensive screening before rejection, which might indicate a more thorough evaluation process or potentially more hurdles to pass.

### 3. **Successful Tenancies and Duration:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Successful tenancies (leading to move-in and rent payment) are less frequent, and the processes often include extensive screening. The longest process leading to tenant cancellation involves multiple rent payments.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - More instances of successful tenancies, but these also often end in tenant cancellation. The processes are similar in length and complexity but occur more frequently.

   **Observation:** While both groups have tenants who eventually cancel their leases, the protected group seems to have fewer successful tenancies relative to their population, possibly indicating a higher barrier to entry or shorter tenancy duration.

### 4. **Performance Time:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Generally, the processes involving extensive screening and leading to rejection or tenancy have higher performance times, suggesting longer durations for these processes.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Similar processes have slightly lower performance times, which could imply quicker decision-making or less thorough checks.

   **Observation:** The protected group might experience longer waiting times or more prolonged evaluation periods, which could be seen as a form of delay or additional scrutiny.

### 5. **Variety of Process Variants:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - More varied and complex process variants, including scenarios with multiple rent payments before cancellation.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - While there are also complex variants, the variety seems slightly less, and the frequency of these complex scenarios is lower.

   **Observation:** The complexity and variety in the protected group's processes might reflect a more stringent or varied approach to tenant evaluation and management.

### Conclusion:
The main differences suggest that the protected group might be subjected to:
- More frequent and possibly more rigorous screening processes.
- Longer times to rejection or acceptance, indicating potentially more scrutiny or bureaucratic hurdles.
- A higher likelihood of early rejections in some cases, possibly reflecting bias or different criteria in initial assessments.

These differences could point towards systemic biases or different operational standards applied to the two groups, potentially leading to unfair treatment or outcomes for the unprotected group. Further investigation would be required to determine if these differences are justified or if they reflect discriminatory practices.
