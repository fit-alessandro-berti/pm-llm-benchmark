Below is a structured approach to using process mining techniques for Speedy Parcels’ last-mile delivery operations, focusing on how to integrate and analyze their data to uncover inefficiencies and propose data-driven improvements.


1. PROCESS DISCOVERY AND CONFORMANCE CHECKING


1.1. Data Preprocessing and Integration

• Consolidating Multiple Data Sources:  
  – GPS Trackers: Offers granular, high-frequency location and speed data for each vehicle.  
  – Driver Scanners: Captures delivery-specific events (“Arrive Customer,” “Delivery Success,” “Delivery Failed,” etc.).  
  – Dispatch System: Provides planned routes, assigned packages, and customer-requested time windows.  
  – Maintenance Logs: Records scheduled and unscheduled vehicle maintenance events.  

• Creating a Unified Event Log:  
  – Align Timestamp Formats: Convert timestamps to a uniform time standard (e.g., UTC or local time zone).  
  – Define Case IDs:  
    - Primary case could be the “Vehicle-Day” (e.g., V12-20241205), ensuring that all events for that vehicle on a specific date are grouped.  
    - Each delivery stop or package can be linked as sub-cases or secondary case references if needed.  
  – Standardize Attributes: Ensure each event has consistent attributes (event name, timestamp, resource/driver, location, etc.).  
  – Merge Data Rows and Handle Duplicates: Carefully combine events from different sources, removing duplicates or spurious entries by matching on timestamps, vehicle ID, and activity type.  

• Challenges and Potential Solutions:  
  – Data Cleansing: GPS pings may be too frequent or inaccurate in dense areas; filter noise/invalid signals.  
  – Event Granularity: Delivery scanner events might be delayed if transmission is offline; implement sensible cutoff or correction mechanisms.  
  – Missing or Conflicting Data: Maintenance logs might not precisely align with operational events, requiring interpolation or domain knowledge to reconcile overlaps.  

1.2. Process Discovery

• Using Discovery Algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner, Fuzzy Miner)  
  – Map Out the Actual Process Flow:  
    - From “Depart Depot”  various “Arrive Customer”  “Delivery Success/Failed”  possible “Unscheduled Stop”  “Arrive Depot.”  
    - Include maintenance events as part of the process to observe how breakdowns or planned maintenance interrupt normal deliveries.  
  – Visualize the Real-World Sequence:  
    - Identify loops (e.g., repeated attempts at a customer stop), parallel activities (some deliveries might be combined), and waiting times (traffic jams, idle times).  

1.3. Conformance Checking

• Comparing Against Planned Routes:  
  – Overlay planned route data (ideal sequence of stops, estimated times) onto the discovered model.  
  – Identify Deviations in Flow:  
    - Sequence Deviations (drivers not following expected stop order).  
    - Additional or Missing Steps (unplanned parking or stops, skipping a stop, or returning to depot earlier).  
    - Timing Deviations (prolonged idle time, extended travel time on known segments).  
  – Quantify Deviation Frequency and Severity:  
    - E.g., measure the average lateness at each planned stop versus the dispatch schedule, or count the number of unplanned stops per route.  


2. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION


2.1. Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

• On-Time Delivery Rate:  
  – Ratio of deliveries made within the planned time window vs. total deliveries.  
  – Calculated from comparing scanner “Delivery Success” timestamps with the dispatch system’s promised time window.

• Average Time per Delivery Stop:  
  – (Timestamp of “Depart Customer” – Timestamp of “Arrive Customer”) across all stops, indicating time spent on-scene.  

• Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:  
  – Travel time obtained from GPS intervals between stops.  
  – Service time from scanner events at the customer location.  

• Fuel Consumption per km/package:  
  – Link refill logs or daily fuel usage data to distance traveled per day.  
  – Normalized by either total kilometers or total packages delivered.  

• Vehicle Utilization Rate:  
  – (Hours spent moving / total shift hours).  
  – Cross-referenced with capacity usage (planned vs. actual packages loaded/delivered).

• Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:  
  – Low-speed or idle intervals in suspected traffic congestion vs. expected travel times.

• Rate of Failed Deliveries:  
  – Proportion of “Delivery Failed” events vs. total assigned packages.  

2.2. Identifying Bottlenecks

• Process Mining Techniques:  
  – Performance Analysis in the Discovered Process Model:  
    - Color-coded edges/nodes in the process map to highlight average waiting or processing times.  
    - Identify steps where the cumulative waiting time is significantly higher than average.

• Bottleneck Hypotheses:  
  – Route-Specific Bottlenecks: Certain geographical segments consistently show longer travel times.  
  – Time-of-Day Issues: Rush-hour congestion or unusual spikes in the early morning/evening.  
  – Driver Variances: Some drivers may take longer at each stop or may deviate more often than others.  
  – Vehicle Type and Age: Older vehicles might be more prone to downtime or slower travel speeds.  
  – Parking / Customer Interaction: Extended dwell times due to difficult parking conditions or lengthy customer interactions.  

• Quantifying Impact:  
  – Compare cycle times (depot  multiple stops  return) for each route/driver. Identify high-variance points that suggest a recurring pattern of inefficiency.  
  – Calculate the time lost or extra distance traveled relative to the best-performing peers or historical baselines.  


3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FOR INEFFICIENCIES


3.1. Potential Root Causes

• Suboptimal (Static) Route Planning:  
  – Delivery routes may not account for real-time traffic, causing recurrent congestion-related delays.  

• Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:  
  – Dispatch system might underestimate or overestimate certain segments, leading to poor scheduling and missed time windows.  

• Traffic Congestion Patterns:  
  – Peaks during the day or unexpected events cause significant delays if routes are not dynamically updated.  

• Service Time Variability:  
  – Large differences in how quickly deliveries are processed, due to different customer interactions or packaging complexities.  

• Maintenance Issues:  
  – Breakdown or engine warning events cause unplanned stops, linking to higher downtime and even missed deliveries.  
  – Maintenance schedules might not align well with actual vehicle usage patterns.  

• Driver Behavior and Skill Differences:  
  – Some drivers might deviate based on personal preference, or take excessive breaks.  
  – Others might excel in route execution and handle traffic more effectively.  

• Failed Delivery Attempts:  
  – High re-delivery rates increase total operational cost and slow down future routes.  

3.2. Process Mining Analyses to Validate Causes

• Variant Analysis:  
  – Compare high-performing vs. low-performing routes/drivers. Track differences in average travel time, stop sequence adherence, or waiting times.  

• Traffic Data Correlation:  
  – Overlay traffic data with timestamps to confirm if certain route segments align with known congestion.  

• Dwell Time Analysis:  
  – Focus on “Arrive Customer” to “Depart Customer” intervals to detect repeated excessive service times.  

• Maintenance/Breakdown Impact:  
  – Pattern mining to see how often unplanned stops occur for certain vehicles, linking to overall performance.  


4. DATA-DRIVEN OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES


Below are three distinct, concrete strategies tailored to Speedy Parcels’ context:

4.1. Dynamic Routing and Real-Time Traffic Updates

• Target Inefficiency/Bottleneck: Traffic congestion and static route planning causing late deliveries.  
• Root Cause Addressed: Lack of real-time traffic considerations in the dispatch system.  
• Process Mining Insight: Discovered frequent timing deviations and congested route segments during certain times.  
• Description:  
  – Integrate real-time traffic feeds into dispatch.  
  – Re-calculate route sequences or re-route vehicles “on the fly” when significant delays are detected.  
• Expected Impact on KPIs:  
  – Improve On-Time Delivery Rate by reducing congestion-induced delays.  
  – Lower travel time per delivery stop and reduce fuel consumption by avoiding stop-and-go traffic.

4.2. Predictive Maintenance Scheduling

• Target Inefficiency/Bottleneck: Unscheduled breakdown events causing unexpected downtime.  
• Root Cause Addressed: Maintenance intervals not aligned with actual vehicle usage patterns.  
• Process Mining Insight: High frequency of unscheduled stops and engine warning events correlating with older vehicles or those with higher usage.  
• Description:  
  – Leverage vehicle usage data (mileage, idle times, engine alerts) to schedule maintenance proactively.  
  – Use historical breakdown patterns to predict optimal maintenance windows.  
• Expected Impact on KPIs:  
  – Reduce unplanned downtime, boosting Vehicle Utilization Rate.  
  – Lower maintenance costs by minimizing severe breakdowns.  
  – Increase on-time deliveries by avoiding mid-day breakdowns.

4.3. Improved Delivery Time Window Management and Customer Communication

• Target Inefficiency/Bottleneck: High failed delivery attempts leading to re-deliveries and wasted trips.  
• Root Cause Addressed: Customers not available during scheduled delivery slots; suboptimal coordination.  
• Process Mining Insight: Repeated “Delivery Failed” events linked to specific time windows or customers.  
• Description:  
  – Implement more precise or narrower time windows and send real-time arrival notifications to customers.  
  – Offer flexible re-routing for same-day re-delivery if the driver is close by later.  
• Expected Impact on KPIs:  
  – Reduce Rate of Failed Deliveries; fewer second attempts.  
  – Increase On-Time Delivery Rate by aligning with customers’ schedules.  
  – Lower total travel distance by avoiding repeated deliveries.

Additional Ideas (if relevant):  
• Territory/Route Optimization: Realign geographic zones based on historical delivery densities to reduce travel and driver workload imbalance.  
• Driver Training Programs: Focused training to ensure consistent driving patterns, including new traffic avoidance strategies and efficient customer interaction.


5. CONSIDERING OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS & MONITORING


5.1. Accounting for Operational Constraints

• Driver Working Hours:  
  – Ensure dynamic routing does not violate legally mandated break times or maximum shift lengths.  
  – Process mining can track actual driving vs. break events to maintain compliance.

• Vehicle Capacities:  
  – Keep load distribution feasible when re-routing on-the-fly.  
  – Integrate real-time package constraints into route optimization (especially for bulky items).

• Customer Delivery Time Windows:  
  – Respect high-priority or guaranteed windows when re-optimizing routes.  
  – Provide proactive customer updates if unexpected delays occur.

5.2. Continuous Monitoring with Process Mining Dashboards

• Dashboards and Alerts:  
  – Real-time tracking of key metrics: On-Time Delivery Rate, number of active vehicles, route adherence, unplanned stops.  
  – Post-implementation performance comparisons (before vs. after strategy deployment).

• Ensuring Sustainability and Early Issue Detection:  
  – Frequent conformance checks to detect new route deviations or emergent traffic bottlenecks.  
  – Maintenance analytics to refine predictive maintenance models over time.  
  – Ongoing driver performance analytics to identify training needs or best-practice sharing among drivers.

• Iterative Optimization:  
  – Use feedback loops: each day’s logs feed into the model to refine route planning and maintenance schedules.  
  – Trigger alerts when KPIs deviate significantly from established benchmarks, prompting root-cause analysis.


CONCLUSION


By systematically applying process mining to Speedy Parcels’ integrated event data, the organization can visualize its real-world delivery processes, detect where deviations from planned routes occur, and measure the performance of each critical step. Through analyzing these processes, bottlenecks such as traffic delays, suboptimal routes, or high failure rates become clear, enabling targeted root-cause analysis.  

Implementing dynamic routing, predictive maintenance, and improved time window management represent concrete strategies directly informed by insights in the event logs. These changes, alongside continuous monitoring (via dashboards), ensure that Speedy Parcels can both swiftly address current inefficiencies and adapt to evolving demands, ultimately improving delivery punctuality, reducing operational costs, and meeting customer expectations.
