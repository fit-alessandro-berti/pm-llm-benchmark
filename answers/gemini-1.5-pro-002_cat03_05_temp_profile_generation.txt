This dictionary provides a plausible temporal profile for the given supply chain process, with estimated average times and standard deviations for various activity pairs.  The times are chosen to roughly reflect the durations one might expect in such a process, but they can be easily adjusted.  The inclusion of pairs like `('SS', 'PT')` and `('OP', 'PK')` demonstrates the consideration of activities separated by multiple steps. Remember these are just estimates, and in a real-world scenario, these values would be derived from actual event log data.
