Okay, I've analyzed the event log and identified the activities that need renaming due to their contextual differences. Here's the revised event log with the renamed activities and a justification for each change:

```

**Justification for Naming Choices:**

*   **Initiate Request:** The context of how the request is initiated is important.  It can be from the web portal or a walk-in at the branch.  Adding "(Web Portal)" or "(Branch Reception)" clarifies the source.
*   **Verify Documents:** This activity occurs multiple times in different contexts:
    *   The first occurrence is an initial check.  I've renamed it "Verify Documents (Initial)" to indicate this.
    *   The second occurrence is a re-check after additional documents are submitted. I've renamed it "Verify Documents (Re-check)" to reflect this.
    *   The third occurrence is a physical verification at the branch. I've renamed it "Verify Documents (Physical)" to reflect this.
    *   The fourth occurrence is a re-verification after an account adjustment. I've renamed it "Verify Documents (Post-Adjustment)" to reflect this.
*   **Call Customer:** The reason for the call varies significantly:
    *   In C001, the call is specifically to request missing documents. I've renamed it "Call Customer (Missing Docs)".
    *   In C002, the first call is to clarify an account discrepancy. I've renamed it "Call Customer (Account Discrepancy)".
    *   In C002, the second call is a follow-up to confirm adjustments. I've renamed it "Call Customer (Follow-up)".
    *   In C003, the call is because the customer is absent. I've renamed it "Call Customer (Customer Absent)".

These changes make the event log much more readable and understandable, clearly indicating the purpose of each activity within the context of the case.
