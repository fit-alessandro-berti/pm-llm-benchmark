# Process Compliance Analysis

## 1. Normative Rule Violations

### Case 1
**Status**: Compliant with all normative rules
- The sequence follows the required order: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case
- All required activities are present
- Documentation was properly finalized after approval before closing the case

### Case 2
**Status**: Multiple normative rule violations
1. **Incorrect Sequence**: Risk Assessment was performed before Credit Check
   - This violates the strict ordering rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment
2. **Inappropriate Documentation**: Finalize Documentation was performed after a loan rejection
   - This violates the rule that documentation should not be finalized for rejected applications

### Case 3
**Status**: Compliant with all normative rules
- The sequence follows the required order
- All required activities for an approved loan are present
- Documentation was properly finalized after approval before closing the case

## 2. Desiderata Violations

### Case 1
**Status**: Fully compliant with desiderata
- Credit Check was completed within 30 minutes of application receipt (well within 24 hours)
- Applicant was informed within 2 hours of the loan decision (well within 48 hours)
- No mention of a Follow-up Call, but this is only encouraged, not required

### Case 2
**Status**: Partially compliant with desiderata
- Credit Check and Risk Assessment were both completed quickly after application receipt
- Applicant notification timing is not specified in the log
- No Follow-up Call was recorded (though this is only encouraged)

### Case 3
**Status**: Multiple desiderata violations
1. **Delayed Credit Check**: Credit Check occurred 2 days after Application Received
   - This exceeds the recommended 24-hour window
2. **Delayed Applicant Notification**: Inform Applicant occurred more than 48 hours after Loan Decision
   - The decision was made on Jan 14 at 12:00, but the applicant was only informed on Jan 16 at 15:00
3. **No Follow-up Call**: While not strictly required, a Follow-up Call was not conducted

## 3. Interpretations and Justifications

### Case 1
This case represents ideal process execution. All activities were performed in the correct sequence with appropriate timing. The entire process was completed efficiently within a single day, suggesting good resource allocation and workflow management.

### Case 2
The sequence violation (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) might indicate:
- A training issue with staff not understanding the proper sequence
- A system issue that allowed activities to be recorded out of order
- Pressure to expedite the process, causing steps to be performed out of sequence

The inappropriate documentation after rejection might suggest:
- Confusion about the process requirements for rejected applications
- An automated system that doesn't properly differentiate between approved and rejected paths
- A staff member following a generic checklist without considering the loan decision outcome

### Case 3
The timing delays might be justified by:
- Weekend interruption (application received on Jan 12, which was a Friday, with processing resuming on Monday Jan 14)
- High workload or resource constraints causing backlogs
- Possible need for additional information from the applicant

The absence of a Follow-up Call, while not a serious violation, represents a missed opportunity for customer service and relationship building.

## Summary

Only Case 2 contains serious normative violations that compromise process integrity. Case 3 shows several desiderata violations that, while not critical, indicate opportunities for process improvement. Case 1 demonstrates ideal process execution that could serve as a benchmark for future applications.
