Alright, so I need to write a DuckDB SQL query based on the user's prompt. Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, the problem is about analyzing an event log stored in a DuckDB table called `event_log`. The table has columns like `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. The goal is to identify certain cases that follow a specific sequence of activities and then exclude those cases from the final result.

The first requirement is to find any `case_id` that has the exact sequence of three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed by 'Create Order', and then 'Confirm Order'. Importantly, there should be no other events from the same case between these three events. This means that after the first activity, the next activity must be the second, and then the third, without any intervening events.

Next, among the cases that have this specific sequence, I need to further refine the selection by looking at the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. Specifically, I have to check if this duration is more than 5 days. If it is, these cases should be excluded from the final result.

The final result should include all events from `event_log` except those that belong to cases meeting both the sequence and timing criteria. So, the query needs to filter out these specific cases and return all other events.

Now, thinking about how to approach this in DuckDB. I know that DuckDB is a lightweight SQL database, so I'll need to use SQL functions and possibly window functions to handle the sequence and timing conditions.

For the sequence part, I'll need to ensure that the three activities appear in the correct order without any other activities in between. One way to handle this is by using a window function to look ahead and check the next activities. Alternatively, I can assign a sequence number to each activity in a case and then check the order.

But a more efficient way might be to use the `lead()` function to look at the next activity and the one after that. This way, I can check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'. This approach ensures that the three activities are consecutive.

Once I identify the cases that meet this sequence, I need to calculate the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. I can do this by finding the timestamps of these two activities for each case and subtracting them to get the duration. If this duration is more than 5 days, I exclude those cases.

To exclude these cases from the final result, I'll need to collect all the `case_id` values that meet both conditions and then use a `WHERE` clause to exclude them from the main query.

Putting it all together, I'll write a subquery to identify the bad cases (those that have the sequence and the timing issue). Then, in the main query, I'll select all events where the `case_id` is not in the list of bad cases.

I also need to make sure that the timestamps are correctly compared. Since `timestamp` is a datetime type, subtracting them will give me the interval between the two times. I'll convert this interval to days using the `extract()` function to check if it's greater than 5 days.

Additionally, I should group the results by `case_id` and activity to ensure that each case is processed correctly. Ordering by `case_id` and timestamp will help in correctly identifying the sequence.

Testing this approach, I can imagine that for each row where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', I check the next two activities. If they match the required sequence, I then check the time difference. If the difference is more than 5 days, I add the `case_id` to the list of bad cases.

In the main query, I simply exclude these `case_id` values and return all other events. This should give me the desired result set.

I think this approach covers all the requirements. Now, I'll structure the SQL query accordingly, making sure to handle the sequence and timing conditions properly.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`. The goal is to identify specific cases that follow a particular sequence of activities and exclude them from the final result based on certain conditions.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Sequence of Activities**: We need to identify cases where the activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' appear in direct succession without any other activities in between.

2. **Check Timing Condition**: For cases that meet the sequence condition, we further check if the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' activities is more than 5 days.

3. **Exclude Identified Cases**: Exclude the cases that meet both the sequence and timing conditions from the final result.

### Solution Code

```sql
WITH bad_cases AS (
  SELECT 
    e1.case_id
  FROM 
    event_log e1
  WHERE 
    e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 
        1 
      FROM 
        event_log e2 
      WHERE 
        e2.case_id = e1.case_id 
        AND e2.activity = 'Create Order' 
        AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
      LIMIT 1
    )
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 
        1 
      FROM 
        event_log e3 
      WHERE 
        e3.case_id = e1.case_id 
        AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order' 
        AND e3.timestamp > (SELECT timestamp FROM event_log e2 WHERE e2.case_id = e1.case_id AND e2.activity = 'Create Order' ORDER BY timestamp ASC LIMIT 1)
      LIMIT 1
    )
  GROUP BY 
    e1.case_id
  HAVING 
    (MAX(CAST(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(e3.timestamp) - MAX(e2.timestamp))) AS INT)) / 86400) > 5
)
SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  event_log
WHERE 
  case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM bad_cases);
```

### Explanation

1. **Identify the Sequence of Activities**: The query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `bad_cases` to identify cases where the activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' appear in direct succession. This is done using the `EXISTS` clause to check for the presence of the subsequent activities in the correct order.

2. **Check Timing Condition**: For each case identified in the sequence, the query calculates the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' activities. If this duration is more than 5 days, the case is marked for exclusion.

3. **Exclude Identified Cases**: The main query selects all events from the `event_log` table but excludes cases identified in the `bad_cases` CTE. This ensures that only events from cases that do not meet both the sequence and timing conditions are included in the final result.

This approach efficiently filters out the required cases while ensuring the integrity of the sequence and timing conditions.
