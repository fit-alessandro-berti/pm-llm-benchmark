Here are the main anomalies in the process data:

1. **Duplicate Frequency**: There are several cases with the same frequency (e.g., `create fine -> payment -> insert fine notification -> add penalty -> payment`) but different performance numbers. This suggests that some processes are being repeated with different frequencies, which may indicate incorrect or unnecessary steps.
2. **Unnecessary Steps**: Some processes (e.g., `create fine -> send fine -> insert fine notification -> add penalty -> payment`, `create fine -> send fine -> insert fine notification -> add penalty -> insert date appeal to prefecture -> add penalty -> send appeal to prefecture`) contain unnecessary steps that do not contribute to the overall goal of processing a fine.
3. **Overlapping Frequentities**: Some processes have overlapping frequentities (e.g., `create fine -> payment -> send fine -> insert fine notification -> add penalty -> payment`). This suggests that some processes are being executed multiple times at the same frequency, which may lead to errors or inefficient processing.
4. **High Variability in Performance**: The performance numbers for some processes (e.g., `create fine -> payment -> insert fine notification -> add penalty -> payment`) are high, suggesting that these processes are taking a long time to complete.
5. **Variable Amounts of Data**: Some processes receive varying amounts of data (e.g., `create fine -> send fine -> insert fine notification -> add penalty -> payment`, `create fine -> send fine -> insert fine notification -> insert date appeal to prefecture -> add penalty -> send appeal to prefecture`). This suggests that the process may be receiving different types of data or performing different actions based on the amount of data received.

These anomalies highlight the need for careful process optimization and process simplification to improve efficiency and reduce errors.
