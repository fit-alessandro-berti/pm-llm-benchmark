Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to look at the event logs provided and find any anomalies or undesirable behaviors. Then, I need to hypothesize why they happened and suggest SQL queries to investigate further. 

First, I'll start by reviewing the example data given for each case_id. The normal process flow is outlined as steps 1 to 7, so any deviation from that order might be an issue. Let's look at each case one by one.

Starting with case 1001. The events go in the correct order: Register Order, Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment. That seems normal. The timestamp progression is also logical, each step happening after the previous. So no issues here.

Moving to case 1002. The first event is Register Order, which is correct. Next is Confirm Shipment at event_id 9 (timestamp 08:25). Wait, according to the normal process, after Register Order should be Credit Check, then Validate Stock. Here, Confirm Shipment is happening before those steps. That's a problem. Then, the next event is Ship Goods (event 10) at 08:40, which is even earlier than Credit Check (09:10). So the order is messed up here. The steps are out of sequence. Also, the Credit Check and Validate Stock happen after shipment, which is backwards. That's definitely an anomaly.

Case 1003: The steps here are Register Order, Credit Check, Ship Goods (event 17 at 09:10), then Issue Invoice and Confirm Shipment. The normal process requires Confirm Shipment before Ship Goods. Here, they did Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment (event 19 at 09:45). So the order is inverted here; Ship Goods should come after Confirm Shipment. That's another anomaly.

Case 1004: The events here start with Register Order, then Receive Payment (event 22 at 09:05) right after, followed by Issue Invoice (23 at 09:20). Normally, you should issue the invoice before receiving payment. So receiving payment before the invoice is issued is a problem. Also, the order skips some steps like Credit Check and Validate Stock. The process flow here skips steps 2 and 3 (Credit Check and Stock Validation) and goes straight to Payment and Invoice. That's a major deviation from the norm.

So the main anomalies are:

1. In case 1002, steps 4 (Confirm Shipment) and 3 (Validate Stock) are out of order. They did Confirm Shipment before Credit Check and Validate Stock, which are earlier steps.

2. In case 1003, Ship Goods (step5) came before Confirm Shipment (step4). The correct order is Confirm first then Ship.

3. Case 1004 has Receive Payment (step7) and Issue Invoice (step6) happening before steps 2-5 (Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm, Ship). Also missing steps 2 and 3 entirely.

Now, possible reasons for these anomalies:

For case 1002 and 1003, maybe there was a rush to fulfill the order, leading to steps being done out of order. Maybe the staff didn't follow the process correctly, or perhaps there was a system error that allowed them to proceed without completing previous steps. Or maybe a misconfiguration in the workflow system that allowed skipping steps.

Case 1004 is more severe. Receiving payment before issuing the invoice is impossible in a normal process. This might be a data entry error, where someone input the events in the wrong order. Alternatively, maybe the invoice was generated after the payment, but that's not how it should work. Or maybe there's a bypass in the system for some reason, but that's risky. Also, not performing credit check and stock validation could lead to financial or logistical issues.

Another point: In case 1002, the Credit Check was done after shipment. That's dangerous because the credit check is meant to determine if the customer is eligible before proceeding. If they shipped before checking credit, they might have sent goods to someone who can't pay, leading to bad debt.

For case 1003, shipping before confirming might lead to logistical issues, like shipping without proper scheduling. The Confirm Shipment step is meant to schedule the shipment, so doing Ship Goods before that could lead to operational problems.

Now, to hypothesize root causes:

- Human error: staff not following the proper process steps in order.
- System bypass: maybe the system allowed steps to be skipped accidentally or intentionally.
- Data entry mistake: the events were recorded in the wrong order, but the actual process was correct. Need to check if the timestamps are accurate.

Possible SQL queries to investigate:

First, check the order of activities for each case_id to see if they follow the expected sequence. For each case, list the activities in the order they occurred and compare to the expected flow.

Also, check for cases where certain activities are missing. Like in case 1004, there's no Credit Check or Validate Stock. So querying cases missing those steps could be useful.

Another angle: look for instances where an activity occurs before its predecessor. For example, in case 1002, Confirm Shipment (step4) came before step2 (Credit Check). So any case where step4's timestamp is before step2's timestamp is an issue.

Similarly, for case 1003, Ship Goods (step5) before step4 (Confirm Shipment).

For case 1004, the Receive Payment (step7) is before step6 (Issue Invoice). The SQL can check if any case has Receive Payment before Issue Invoice.

Also check for missing steps. The normal process has 7 steps, so any case with less than 7 activities might be missing steps. Let's see:

Looking at the data:

Case 1001 has 7 events. Good.

Case 1002 has 7 events but reordered.

Case 1003 has 5 events (Register, Credit Check, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, Receive Payment). Wait, the table shows 6 entries? Let me recount:

Looking at case 1003's entries: 15 (Register), 16 (Credit), 17 (Ship), 18 (Invoice), 19 (Confirm), 20 (Payment). So that's 6 steps. The normal process has 7 steps, so they might be missing step3 (Validate Stock). So that's another anomaly.

Similarly, case 1004 has 5 events. Let's list them:

21 (Register), 22 (Receive Payment), 23 (Invoice), 24 (Confirm), 25 (Ship). So missing steps 2 (Credit Check), 3 (Validate Stock), and 4 (Confirm Shipment? Wait, they have Confirm Shipment, but it's step4. But they skipped steps 2 and 3 entirely. So missing those steps is another issue.

So queries could check for missing activities. For example, for each case, check if all required steps are present. The required steps are all 7 activities.

Another query could look for cases where certain steps are out of order. For instance, Check if "Confirm Shipment" occurs before "Perform Credit Check".

Also, checking for "Ship Goods" before "Confirm Shipment".

Additionally, "Receive Payment" before "Issue Invoice".

Also, missing activities: any case missing any of the 7 steps.

Possible SQL steps:

1. Find all cases where the sequence of activities doesn't follow the correct order.

This might be a bit complex. Alternatively, check for specific out-of-order pairs.

For example:

SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
FROM order_event_log
WHERE case_id = 1002
ORDER BY timestamp;

Looking at case 1002's activities:

Register (08:15), then Confirm Shipment (08:25), Ship Goods (08:40), then Credit Check (09:10), etc. So Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods come before Credit Check and Validate Stock. 

So to find such cases where Confirm Shipment is before Credit Check:

SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
AND oel2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

That would find cases where Confirm happened before Credit Check.

Similarly, for Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment:

SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods' 
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM order_event_log oel2 
    WHERE oel2.case_id = order_event_log.case_id 
    AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
    AND order_event_log.timestamp < oel2.timestamp
);

Wait, actually, need to check if Ship Goods happened before Confirm Shipment. Wait no. The correct order is Confirm Shipment first, then Ship Goods. So Ship Goods before Confirm would be an issue. Wait no: the correct sequence is step4 is Confirm Shipment, then step5 Ship Goods. So Ship Goods should come after Confirm. So if Ship Goods is before Confirm, that's a problem.

Wait: the process flow is:

1. Register Order

2. Credit Check

3. Validate Stock

4. Confirm Shipment

5. Ship Goods

6. Issue Invoice

7. Receive Payment

So the Confirm Shipment (4) must come before Ship Goods (5). So Ship Goods must have a timestamp after Confirm Shipment. So the query would look for Ship Goods with timestamp < Confirm's timestamp.

So for case 1003, Ship Goods was at 09:10, Confirm Shipment at 09:45. Wait no, in case 1003's data:

Looking at the data for case 1003:

event 17 (Ship Goods) at 09:10, and event 19 (Confirm Shipment) at 09:45. Wait, no: the timestamps for case 1003's events:

Looking at the data provided for case 1003:

The events are:

event_id 15 (Reg), 16 (Credit), 17 (Ship Goods at 09:10), 18 (Invoice), 19 (Confirm at 09:45). Wait no, event 17 is Ship Goods, and event 19 is Confirm Shipment. Wait, that's the reverse. So Ship Goods happened before Confirm Shipment, which is wrong. The Confirm should be before Ship. So in case 1003, Ship Goods (event17 at 09:10) before Confirm Shipment (event19 at 09:45). So Ship Goods is earlier, which is wrong. So the query needs to find Ship Goods events where their timestamp is before the corresponding Confirm Shipment's timestamp for the same case.

Another anomaly in case 1004: Receive Payment (event22) at 09:05, but the Issue Invoice (event23) is at 09:20. So Payment before Invoice. The Invoice should come before Payment. So the Receive Payment should have a later timestamp than the Issue Invoice. To find cases where Payment is before Invoice.

Also, checking for cases missing certain activities. For example, looking for case_id where there's no 'Perform Credit Check' activity.

SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 END) = 0;

This would find cases that skipped the credit check.

Similarly for missing steps like Validate Stock.

Additionally, checking for cases where the same activity is done more than once, but that's not shown in the examples.

Another point: in case 1002, the Credit Officer (CreditOfficer_2) did the Credit Check after the shipment, which could be a training issue or process oversight.

So possible SQL queries:

First, to find all cases where the sequence of activities is not in the correct order. But that's complex. Instead, check for specific out-of-order pairs.

For example, to find cases where Ship Goods occurred before Confirm Shipment:

SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM order_event_log confirm
    WHERE confirm.case_id = order_event_log.case_id
    AND confirm.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    AND order_event_log.timestamp < confirm.timestamp
);

Wait no, that would find Ship Goods before Confirm. Wait the correct order is Confirm first, so if Ship Goods is before Confirm, that's an issue. The query should find when Ship Goods timestamp is before Confirm's timestamp.

Wait the query should compare the timestamps between the two activities for the same case_id. So perhaps a join:

SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

This would find cases where Ship Goods happened before Confirm Shipment.

Similarly, for cases where Confirm Shipment happened before Credit Check:

SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND oel2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

This would find cases where Confirm Shipment was done before Credit Check.

Another query for cases where 'Receive Payment' happened before 'Issue Invoice':

SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

This would show cases where payment was received before the invoice was issued.

Also, check for missing activities:

SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) < 7;

But since the process has 7 steps, but some cases might have less. However, in the sample data, case 1003 has 6 steps (since they have 6 entries?), wait the first table shows case 1003 has 6 events (event_ids 15 to 20?), but the example shows 6 rows for case 1003 (15,16,17,18,19,20). But the process requires 7 steps. So the count of activities should be 7. So case 1003 is missing one, probably 'Validate Stock'.

So a query to find cases with less than 7 distinct activities.

SELECT case_id, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) as activity_count
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING activity_count < 7;

That would find cases missing one or more steps.

Additionally, looking at case 1004, they have:

Register Order (1), Receive Payment (2), Issue Invoice (3?), but looking at the data for case 1004:

case 1004's events:

event 21: Register

22: Receive Payment

23: Issue Invoice

24: Confirm Shipment

25: Ship Goods

So the activities are:

Register, Receive Payment, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods. Missing steps 2 (Credit Check), 3 (Validate Stock), and maybe others. So the count would be 5 activities (since they have 5 entries?), so activity count is 5, so the query above would catch that.

Another possible issue: In case 1004, they did not do Credit Check and Validate Stock. That's a big problem because those are critical steps. The SQL to find cases without Credit Check:

SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check' GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) = 0;

Wait, better:

SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 END) = 0;

Similarly for Validate Stock.

Putting all that together, the SQL queries should check for these specific out-of-order steps, missing steps, and other anomalies.

Additionally, looking at the resources involved. For instance, in case 1004, who did the steps? Maybe a resource performed an activity they shouldn't have. For example, in case 1002, the Credit Officer did the check after shipment, but maybe their role is supposed to do it earlier.

Also, looking into the resources' roles. For example, the Credit Check should be done by a Credit Officer (as in the resources table). Let's see the resources table: CreditOfficer_1 and 2 are in Finance. So that's okay. But maybe someone else did it?

Alternatively, maybe the person performing the activity is incorrect. For example, if a SalesRep did a Credit Check, that would be a role issue. But in the data provided, the Credit Checks are done by Credit Officers, so maybe that's okay.

Another angle: the timestamps between steps. For instance, the time between steps might be too short or too long, but the problem here is more about order.

Also, in case 1004, the order_value is 3000, which might be a large order. Maybe priority orders bypass steps, but the order_type for 1004 is standard, so that's not the case.

Another possible query: for each case_id, list all activities in order to see the sequence.

But for the purpose of the answer, the user wants the model to come up with these hypotheses and the queries.

So, compiling the anomalies and queries:

Anomalies identified:

1. Out-of-order activities (Confirm Shipment before Credit Check, Ship Goods before Confirm, Payment before Invoice).

2. Missing activities (like Credit Check, Validate Stock, or others).

3. In case 1004, all the steps after step1 (Register) are out of order and missing steps 2,3, and possibly others.

Hypotheses for why:

- Staff rushing, skipping steps to save time, leading to process violations.

- System errors where the system allowed proceeding without completing prior steps.

- Misconfiguration in the workflow engine that allowed steps to be executed out of order.

- Data entry errors where the event log was recorded incorrectly.

Proposed SQL queries:

1. Find cases where 'Ship Goods' occurred before 'Confirm Shipment':

SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

2. Cases where 'Confirm Shipment' occurred before 'Perform Credit Check':

SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND oel2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

3. Cases where 'Receive Payment' occurred before 'Issue Invoice':

SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

4. Find cases missing 'Perform Credit Check':

SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING COUNT(DASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 END) = 0;

Same for 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', etc. But according to the example, case 1004 is missing some.

5. Find cases with fewer than 7 distinct activities:

SELECT case_id, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS activity_count
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING activity_count < 7;

Additionally, checking for cases where 'Validate Stock' is missing.

Another angle: For each case, check the order of all activities. That's more complex but could be done with window functions, ordering events by timestamp and checking the sequence.

But the user wants the model to propose relevant queries. So the above queries should cover the main points.

Also, looking at the resources involved. For instance, who did the out-of-order steps. Maybe certain employees or departments are more prone to these mistakes.

For example:

SELECT resource, COUNT(*) 
FROM order_event_log
WHERE case_id IN (cases found in previous queries)
GROUP BY resource;

But the user might need to run the previous queries first.

Another query: Check for cases where 'Confirm Shipment' was done by someone from Logistics, but maybe the department should be checked. But the departments are correct (LogisticsMgr is in Logistics).

Alternatively, check if the 'Confirm Shipment' was done by a non-logistics resource? Probably not in the examples.

Another query: Find cases where 'Receive Payment' was done by FinanceTeam_02 before the invoice was issued by FinanceTeam_01, etc. Not sure, but maybe looking at resources could help.

But the main issues are the sequence and missing steps.

So the main points are the out-of-order steps and missing activities.

Another possible anomaly in case 1002: The Credit Check was done after shipment. So the credit check was done after shipment, which is risky.

Another angle: The 'Validate Stock' step is missing in case 1003 and 1004. Case 1003 has 'stock_checked=OK' in the additional info in event12 (case1002's event 12 is Validate Stock, but case1003's events: looking back at the data for case 1003:

case1003's events:

- event15: Register

- event16: Credit Check

- event17: Ship Goods (missing Validate Stock and Confirm Shipment (but Confirm came later). Wait, in case1003, the event19 is 'Confirm Shipment', but after shipping. So they did Ship Goods without confirming? Or maybe the confirm was done after. Anyway, the missing steps are the main issue.

For case1003, the 'Validate Stock' activity is missing. Looking at the data for case1003's activities:

Looking at the data provided for case1003:

The third event (event17) is Ship Goods, but the second is Credit Check. There is no 'Validate Stock' activity listed for case1003. The activities listed are:

Looking at case1003's activities: 

Looking at the third table (case1003's event log):

Their events:

event 17 is Ship Goods, so between Credit Check (event16) and Ship Goods (event17), there's no 'Validate Stock. So that step is missing.

So the query to find cases without 'Validate Stock':

SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) =0;

Similarly for Credit Check.

So the SQL queries would help identify these.

In summary, the model should present these anomalies, their hypotheses, and the queries.
</think>

**Anomalies and Hypotheses:**

### 1. **Out-of-Order Activities**
#### Case 1002:
- **Anomaly**: 
  - `Confirm Shipment` (step 4) occurred **before** `Perform Credit Check` (step 2) and `Validate Stock` (step 3). 
  - `Ship Goods` (step 5) occurred before `Confirm Shipment` (step 4). 
- **Hypothesis**: 
  - Staff may have bypassed critical risk checks (e.g., credit or stock validation) due to urgency, or the system allowed premature progression without validation.

#### Case 1003:
- **Anomaly**: 
  - `Ship Goods` (step 5) occurred **before** `Confirm Shipment` (step 4. 
  - `Validate Stock` (step 3) is **missing** entirely. 
- **Hypothesis**: 
  - Process shortcuts (e.g., skipping validation steps) or data-entry errors (e.g., activities recorded in the wrong sequence).

#### Case 1004:
- **Anomaly**: 
  - `Receive Payment` (step 7) occurred **before** `Issue Invoice` (step 6) and **before** critical steps like `Perform Credit Check` (step 2) and `Validate Stock` (step 3. 
- **Hypothesis**: 
  - Process misconfiguration (e.g., workflow engine skipped steps) or fraud (e.g., manual overrides to fast-track payments without due diligence).

---

### 2. **Missing Critical Steps**
- **Case 1003 and 1004**: 
  - Both lack `Validate Stock` (step 3), increasing the risk of shipping unavailable inventory. 
  - Case 1004 also lacks `Perform Credit Check` (step 2), risking approval of high-risk customers (e.g., order value = $3000 for case 1004). 
- **Hypothesis**: 
  - Workflow skips were intentional (e.g., "priority" orders bypassing checks) or accidental (e.g., oversight by staff).

---

### 3. **Possible Root Causes**
- **System Flaws**: 
  - Workflow engine allows step skipping or timestamp misalignment. 
- **Human Error**: 
  - Staff bypassing steps for expediency or lack of training. 
- **Data Entry Errors**: 
  - Activities recorded in the wrong order, or missing entries in the log.

---

### Proposed SQL Queries

#### 1. **Identify Cases with Out-of-Order Activities**
```sql
-- Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment (step5 before step4)
SELECT oel1.case_id, oel1.activity AS activity1, oel2.activity AS activity2
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

-- Confirm Shipment before Credit Check (step4 before step2)
SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND oel2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

-- Receive Payment before Issue Invoice (step7 before step6)
SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;
```

#### 2. **Identify Cases Missing Critical Steps**
```sql
-- Find cases missing 'Perform Credit Check'
SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;

-- Find cases missing 'Validate Stock'
SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;
```

#### 3. **List All Activities in Each Case to Audit Order**
```sql
SELECT case_id, activity, "timestamp"
FROM order_event_log
ORDER BY case_id, "timestamp";
```

#### 4. **Check for Cases with Fewer Than 7 Steps**
```sql
SELECT case_id, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS activity_count
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING activity_count < 7;
```

#### 5. **Flag Cases with High-Risk Omissions (e.g., $3000 order without Credit Check)**
```sql
SELECT oel.case_id, o.order_value
FROM orders o
JOIN order_event_log oel ON o.case_id = oel.case_id
WHERE o.order_value > 1000  -- Focus on high-value orders
AND oel.case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
);
```

#### 6. **Identify Resources Involved in Anomalies**
```sql
-- Who performed out-of-order steps?
SELECT oel.resource, oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp
FROM order_event_log oel
WHERE (activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM order_event_log
    WHERE case_id = oel.case_id
    AND activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
    AND "timestamp" > oel.timestamp
))
OR (activity = 'Ship Goods' AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM order_event_log
    WHERE case_id = oel.case_id
    AND activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    AND "timestamp" > oel.timestamp
));
``` 

---

### Key Findings from the Example Data:
- **Case 1002**: `Confirm Shipment` and `Ship Goods` occurred before credit checks and stock validation.  
- **Case 1003**: `Ship Goods` before `Confirm Shipment` and missing `Validate Stock`.  
- **Case 1004**: `Receive Payment` before `Issue Invoice`, and missing credit checks/stock checks for a $3,000 order.  

These anomalies pose financial and operational risks (e.g., shipping goods without validated stock or credit approval). The queries above can help identify systemic issues in the workflow engine or staff compliance.
