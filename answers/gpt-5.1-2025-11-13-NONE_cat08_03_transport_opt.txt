## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### 1.1 Data integration & preprocessing

**Goal:** One coherent event log where each “case” represents a meaningful operational unit, e.g.:

- Primary case: `Vehicle-Day` (V1220241205) for fleet/route analysis.
- Secondary cases (via object-centric / multiple logs): `Package`, `Stop`, `Maintenance Case`.

**a) Unifying keys and timestamps**

- **Time normalization**
  - Convert all timestamps to a single timezone and format.
  - Ensure correct ordering for events with same timestamp (e.g., add milliseconds, or deterministic ordering rule: GPS  Driver  Scanner  Dispatch).

- **Case ID construction**
  - Build `Case ID = VehicleID + Date`, based on shift start or first ignition-on.
  - Include `Package ID` as an attribute (and possibly build a second log where `Case ID = Package ID` for parcel-level analysis).

- **Event ID & source**
  - Add attributes: `SourceSystem  {GPS, Scanner, Dispatch, Maintenance}`, `EventID`, `EventType`.

**b) Event abstraction from raw GPS**

GPS generates many low-level events. For process mining, you need **higher-level activities**:

- Detect **trips**:
  - From `Depart Depot` to first stop, between stops, and final return.
- Detect **stops**:
  - Parking / delivery stops (speed  0 near a known customer location for  X minutes).
  - Traffic stops / congestion (speed < threshold over distance, no scanner activity).
- Detect **vehicle states**:
  - Moving, idling (engine on, speed 0), waiting, unscheduled stop.

Create higher-level activities such as:
- `Drive to Stop n`
- `Search Parking`
- `Wait in Traffic`
- `Idle at Roadside`
- `Unscheduled Stop (Vehicle Issue)`

These can be derived using segmentation algorithms on GPS traces plus proximity to customer coordinates.

**c) Joining the sources**

- **GPS  Scanner (stops & deliveries)**
  - Match scanner events (Arrive Customer, Delivery Success, etc.) to nearest GPS points in space and time.
  - Derive `DriveTimeToStop`, `ServiceTimeAtStop`, `DwellTimeTotal` for each stop.
- **Dispatch plan  Execution**
  - From dispatch: planned stop sequence, ETA per stop, planned packages, vehicle assignment, planned start/end.
  - Attach planned attributes to the corresponding executed stop or route segment.
- **Maintenance logs**
  - Add events like `Maintenance Start`, `Maintenance End`, with vehicle id.
  - For maintenance during operating hours, they become internal activities in `Vehicle-Day` cases.
  - For off-shift maintenance, a separate `Maintenance Case` log can be created but still linked to vehicle ID and odometer/time.

**d) Challenges**

- **Data quality & granularity**
  - Missing or noisy GPS points; scanner events without GPS nearby; duplicates.
- **Clock synchronization**
  - Different system clocks cause misalignment; need clock offset estimation (e.g., use depot events as reference).
- **Event semantics**
  - Distinguishing planned breaks vs. unplanned idle time.
  - Distinguishing customer-side waiting vs. driver personal breaks if not explicitly logged.
- **Multi-object nature**
  - Vehicle-day vs. package vs. stop vs. maintenance; object-centric process mining may be beneficial but is more complex to set up.

### 1.2 Process discovery (actual endtoend process)

Assume we use a `Vehicle-Day` log with a sequence such as:

`Start Shift  Route Assigned  Depart Depot  [Drive to Area  Arrive Customer  …  Depart Customer]*  Unscheduled Stop (if any)  Arrive Depot  End Shift`

Steps:

1. **Event abstraction & labeling**
   - Clean and categorize activities into a manageable set:
     - Depot: Start Shift, Route Assigned, Load Vehicle, Depart Depot, Arrive Depot, End Shift.
     - Driving: Drive to Area, Drive Between Stops, Wait in Traffic, Idle (Nondelivery), Fuel Stop.
     - Delivery: Arrive Customer, Delivery Success, Delivery Failed (Customer Not Home), Delivery Failed (Access Problem), Depart Customer.
     - Maintenance: Unscheduled Stop (Warning), Tow to Garage, Maintenance Start, Maintenance End.

2. **Discovery algorithms**
   - Use standard algorithms:
     - Heuristics Miner / Fuzzy Miner to quickly see main patterns and frequencies.
     - Inductive Miner (with performance overlay) for sound models and performance analysis.
   - Generate:
     - **Control-flow model** of a typical `Vehicle-Day`.
     - Optional: a `Package`-level model from `Scan at Depot`  `Out for Delivery`  `Arrive Customer`  `Delivered / Failed`  `Return to Depot` (if reattempt).

3. **Process views**
   - **Standard day view:** Most common sequence of activities.
   - **Exception view:** Paths containing `Unscheduled Stop`, `Repeated Delivery Attempt`, or `Excessive Idle`.
   - **Stop-level view:** Subprocess covering Arrive Customer  Delivery X  Depart Customer.

The result: a visual model showing real flows, loops (e.g., multiple attempts per customer), frequent patterns (`Wait in Traffic` before specific neighborhoods), and rare events (breakdowns).

---

### 1.3 Conformance checking vs. planned routes

**Reference model:**

- Built from dispatch’s planned route:
  - Planned activity sequence for each vehicle-day: `Depart Depot  Drive planned sequence of stops  Arrive Depot`.
  - Each planned stop has planned order, ETA, service time, and expected packages.

**Conformance checking types:**

1. **Sequence deviations**
   - Skipped planned stops or added unplanned stops.
   - Reordering of stops vs. planned sequence.
   - Extra loops (multiple visits to same area).

2. **Timing deviations**
   - Late departures from depot relative to plan.
   - Actual vs. planned travel times between stops.
   - Actual vs. planned service time per stop.
   - Early or late arrivals relative to customer time windows.

3. **Compliance metrics**
   - Fitness: how much of the real behavior is explained by the planned model.
   - Precision: how much extra behavior the plan allows that never occurs.
   - Per-case deviation scores: total delay, number of unplanned activities, number of re-routings.

4. **Types of deviations to analyze**
   - **Unplanned stops**:
     - Frequent breaks, refueling, unofficial stops, unscheduled maintenance.
   - **Route detours**:
     - Large spatial deviation from planned path, often due to traffic or driver preference.
   - **Time window violations**:
     - Arrivals outside requested windows.
   - **Maintenance interference**:
     - Vehicle goes to the workshop mid-shift; compare with plan (where no such states exist).

You then segment conformance results by driver, area, time-of-day, vehicle type to identify systematic patterns.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### 2.1 Key KPIs & how to compute them

Using the integrated event log, derive:

1. **OnTime Delivery Rate (OTD)**
   - For each package/stop with a time window [Earliest, Latest]:
     - Determine `ArrivalTime` (Arrive Customer event).
     - `OnTime = (ArrivalTime  [Earliest - tolerance, Latest + tolerance])`.
   - OTD = (# OnTime deliveries) / (# Deliveries attempted).

2. **Average Time per Delivery Stop**
   - For each stop:
     - `ServiceTime = Depart Customer - Arrive Customer`.
   - Average per route/driver/area: mean or distribution of `ServiceTime`.

3. **Travel Time vs. Service Time ratio**
   - Per vehicle-day:
     - `TotalTravelTime = sum(Drive segments)`.
     - `TotalServiceTime = sum(ServiceTime at all stops)`.
   - Ratio `TravelTime / ServiceTime` indicates how much time is spent driving vs. servicing customers.

4. **Fuel Consumption per km / per package**
   - Use fuel sensor data (if available) or model consumption:
     - `FuelUsed per day` from telematics / fueling logs.
     - `Fuel per km = FuelUsed / DistanceDriven`.
     - `Fuel per package = FuelUsed / PackagesDelivered`.
   - If direct fuel data missing: approximate via vehicle-specific consumption and driving profile (urban vs. highway, idle share).

5. **Vehicle Utilization Rate**
   - Options:
     - **Time-based:** (ShiftDuration / MaxLegalWorkTime).
     - **Capacity-based:** (Total packages / Vehicle capacity) or (Average load factor over time).
     - **Mileage-based:** (DistanceWithLoad / TotalDistance).

6. **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays**
   - Identify segments labeled `Wait in Traffic` or low-speed driving < threshold.
   - Per route: `TrafficDelayTime = sum(segments where speed < X and not at a stop)`.
   - Frequency: number of days/routes where TrafficDelayTime exceeds a threshold.

7. **Rate of Failed Deliveries**
   - Failure events: Delivery Failed (Attempted) per package or per stop.
   - Rate = (# FailedDeliveries) / (# Attempts) and (# Re-deliveries) / (# Packages).

8. **Maintenance-related KPIs**
   - `UnexpectedBreakdownRate = (#Unscheduled maint. during shift) / (vehicle-days)`.
   - `Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)` per vehicle.
   - Lost delivery time due to maintenance events.

All these can be computed with process mining tools with performance annotations and case-level attributes aggregated.

---

### 2.2 Bottleneck analysis techniques

**a) Performance-annotated process models**

- Overlay the discovered process model with:
  - Average / median durations of edges (e.g., Depart Depot  Arrive Area).
  - Waiting times before certain activities.
- Quickly highlights long edges and slow activities.

**b) Variant analysis**

- Identify variants of `Vehicle-Day`:
  - High-performance vs low-performance days (e.g., top 25% vs bottom 25% OTD).
  - Compare their process models: Which activities or patterns appear more in low-performing variants (e.g., multiple `Unscheduled Stop`, long `Wait in Traffic` before specific stops)?

**c) Bottleneck dimensions**

1. **Routes / territories**
   - Identify route IDs or geographic clusters with:
     - Longer average travel times.
     - Higher traffic delay per km.
     - Higher failure rates.
   - Use heatmaps on map to visualize congestion areas.

2. **Time of day / day of week**
   - Compare performance models segmented by:
     - Morning vs afternoon vs evening routes.
     - Weekday vs weekend.
   - Higher TrafficDelayTime during certain hours indicates peak traffic bottlenecks.

3. **Drivers**
   - Compare average:
     - Idle time.
     - Service time per stop (controlling for customer type).
     - Sequence deviations from plan.
     - Speed profiles (within legal limits).
   - Drivers with consistently longer dwell times or more unplanned stops may indicate training or discipline issues.

4. **Vehicle types**
   - Older vehicles might have:
     - More breakdowns.
     - More fuel consumption.
     - Lower average speed.
   - Use event logs to compare performance by vehicle age/model.

5. **Specific activities**
   - Example: `Search Parking` before `Arrive Customer`.
     - If the wait between actual arrival in the area and Arrive Customer is big, and the GPS trace shows circling around, that’s parking/search bottleneck.
   - Long service times for certain customer segments (e.g., business vs residential high-rise).

**d) Quantifying bottleneck impact**

For each suspected bottleneck:

- Compute **extra time** vs benchmark:
  - E.g., Stops in zone A: average DriveTimeToStop = 14 min; overall average = 10 min; extra = 4 min per stop.
  - Multiply by stops per day to estimate lost time.
- Convert to **cost**:
  - Extra driver hours × hourly cost.
  - Extra km/fuel cost.
- Link to **OTD impact**:
  - Determine correlation between bottleneck presence (e.g., heavy traffic segment) and late deliveries.

---

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Potential root causes and how to analyze them

1. **Suboptimal route planning (static vs dynamic)**

   - Symptom: Frequent large deviations from planned sequence and travel times.
   - Analysis:
     - Conformance checking: high rate of reordering of stops or ad-hoc rerouting by drivers.
     - Compare planned vs actual travel times for each leg.
     - Look for systematic disparity in certain areas / times (e.g. planned 10 min, actual 20 min during morning).
   - Conclusion:
     - If systematic gap: planning is using outdated/static travel times and ignoring time-of-day traffic.

2. **Inaccurate travel time estimations**

   - Symptom: On-time performance is poor despite drivers following planned routes.
   - Analysis:
     - For each link (Stop i  Stop j), compute average actual travel time by time-of-day/day-of-week.
     - Compare with planned travel times.
   - Integrate into planning system as time-dependent travel matrices.

3. **Traffic congestion patterns**

   - Symptom: High `Wait in Traffic` before certain stops or during certain time windows.
   - Analysis:
     - Enrich GPS data with external traffic data if available (or derive from your own historical speeds).
     - Build time-of-day speed profiles per road segment.
     - Map hotspots: where `TrafficDelayTime` is consistently high.
   - Use to support dynamic route selection and time-dependent route planning.

4. **High variability in service time at customer locations**

   - Symptom: ServiceTime per stop has large variance, particularly for certain segments.
   - Analysis:
     - Distribution of ServiceTime by:
       - Customer type (B2B vs B2C; building type).
       - Package count (one parcel vs many).
       - Driver.
     - Apply variance decomposition: much of the variability may be due to specific factors (e.g., high-rise apartments).
   - Process mining: sub-process “Stop” analysis, overlay service times.

5. **Vehicle breakdowns / maintenance during shifts**

   - Symptom: Unscheduled stops, incomplete routes, high overtime.
   - Analysis:
     - Identify `Unscheduled Stop` + `Maintenance Start` events during shifts.
     - Sequence analysis: did warning signals appear on prior days?
     - Relate breakdown rate to:
       - Vehicle age.
       - Total km since last maintenance.
       - Driving conditions (e.g., heavy urban duty cycles).
   - Use survival analysis / predictive models using event log features.

6. **Driver behavior / skill differences**

   - Symptom: Same routes show different performance depending on driver.
   - Analysis:
     - Variant analysis by driver:
       - Compare: idle time share, average speed (within legal bounds), route adherence, service times.
     - Clustering of driver-day traces: identify “patterns of work” (efficient vs inefficient).
   - Make sure to control for route difficulty (e.g., compare drivers on same or similar routes).

7. **Issues related to failed delivery attempts (requiring re-delivery)**

   - Symptom: High rate of `Delivery Failed (Customer Not Home)` and re-deliveries.
   - Analysis:
     - Build package-level process model:
       - Attempt 1  Failed  Back to depot  Attempt 2  …
     - Measure:
       - Probability of success by time-of-day, customer type, day-of-week.
       - Extra cost per re-delivery (drive time + service time).
   - Identify root causes:
       - Poor time window selection.
       - Lack of proactive communication.
       - Wrong addresses / access issues.

### 3.2 Using process mining analyses to validate root causes

- **Variant analysis:**
  - Compare high-performing days (high OTD, low fuel per km) vs low-performing ones:
    - Are low-performers enriched with `Wait in Traffic` or `Unscheduled Stop` activities?
    - Do low-performers show more resequencing of stops?
- **Correlation analysis:**
  - Join process measures (e.g., total traffic delay, number of failed stops) with cost/OTD metrics.
  - Example: regress OTD on fraction of time spent in congestion, route length, driver ID, vehicle age.
- **Dwell time analysis:**
  - Detailed stop subprocess for long dwell times:
    - Are delays due mostly to customer interaction, waiting for the customer, or parking search (seen from GPS wandering around the address)?
- **Temporal slicing:**
  - Look at the same route over different months:
    - Has traffic worsened?
    - Has performance improved after changes to planning?

This combination turns intuitive hypotheses (“drivers are slow”, “traffic is bad”) into quantified, validated root causes.

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Time-Dependent and Dynamic Routing

**Targeted inefficiency/bottleneck:**
- Systematic late deliveries and high travel times due to static, time-agnostic route plans.

**Root cause:**
- Planning uses average or static travel times, not differentiating by time-of-day/day-of-week.
- Routes don’t consider historical congestion patterns.

**Process mining insights supporting it:**
- Conformance analysis shows:
  - Planned 10 min leg vs actual 18 min at 8:00–9:00 consistently on certain roads.
- Performance models show:
  - Recurrent traffic bottlenecks at specific time bands (e.g., inner-city area 08:00–10:00 and 16:00–18:00).
- Variant analysis:
  - Routes that naturally avoid certain areas during peak times have higher OTD and lower travel times.

**Concrete actions:**

1. **Build a time-dependent travel-time matrix**
   - From historical GPS-derived travel times per road segment or OD pair:
     - Segment by 30–60 minute time buckets and day-of-week.
   - Feed this into the route planning engine (or a new optimizer).

2. **Re-design route schedules**
   - Place congestion-prone clusters in off-peak slots where possible.
   - Start some vehicles earlier/later to avoid peak congestion.

3. **Introduce dynamic re-routing**
   - During the day, monitor real-time travel speeds vs historical.
   - If abnormal delays occur:
     - Suggest reordering of remaining stops to minimize total delay.
   - Use process mining as a benchmarking engine: compare dynamic routes vs historical static ones.

**Expected KPI impacts:**

- Higher OTD (fewer arrivals after time windows).
- Reduced TravelTime / ServiceTime ratio (less wasted time in traffic).
- Reduced fuel per km and per package (less stop-and-go congestion).
- Potentially fewer overtime hours due to better predictability.

---

### Strategy 2: Reduce Failed Deliveries via Time Window & Communication Optimization

**Targeted inefficiency/bottleneck:**
- High rate of `Delivery Failed (Customer Not Home)` leading to re-delivery attempts and extra travel.

**Root cause:**
- Misaligned delivery time windows with actual customer presence patterns.
- Insufficient proactive communication and flexibility.

**Process mining insights supporting it:**

- Package-level process mining shows:
  - Certain customer segments or time windows have significantly higher failure rates.
  - Attempts after 11:00, for example, have a 30% failure rate in some residential areas vs 10% early evening.
- Re-delivery flows show:
  - Average extra cost per failed package (extra km + time).
- Temporal analysis indicates:
  - The same addresses succeed more often at certain hours or days.

**Concrete actions:**

1. **Refine time windows**
   - Use historical delivery outcomes per customer/segment to recommend “high success” windows.
   - Adjust default promised windows for new orders based on similar customer profiles.

2. **Proactive communication**
   - Send SMS/email with predicted delivery slot (based on dynamic routing) and allow:
     - Customer confirmation.
     - Option to reschedule or specify safe-drop/neighbor/in pickup point.

3. **Targeted policy changes**
   - For addresses with repeated failure patterns:
     - Encourage alternative delivery locations (lockers, pick-up points).
   - Change sequence: deliver to high-risk no-show addresses in slots with historically higher presence (e.g., after 17:00 for commuters).

**Expected KPI impacts:**

- Lower Failed Delivery Rate and re-delivery frequency.
- Improved OTD (less time wasted on futile attempts, enabling better adherence to schedule for remaining stops).
- Lower fuel & labor cost per delivered package (fewer “empty” trips).
- Higher customer satisfaction from more predictable and successful deliveries.

---

### Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance & Vehicle Allocation Optimization

**Targeted inefficiency/bottleneck:**
- Unscheduled breakdowns mid-route causing route disruption, missed deliveries, and extra maintenance costs.

**Root cause:**
- Maintenance based on fixed schedules or ad-hoc rules, not actual vehicle usage and stress.
- Older / heavily used vehicles assigned to demanding routes.

**Process mining insights supporting it:**

- Maintenance-augmented process model shows:
  - Vehicles with high Unscheduled Stop events also show shorter intervals between maintenance.
- Linking vehicle-day usage patterns (distance, share of stop-and-go, idle time) to breakdown events reveals:
  - Specific duty cycles more likely cause issues (e.g., constant short trips with heavy stop-and-go urban traffic).
- Variant analysis:
  - Routes with breakdowns have 20–40% higher `Unscheduled Stop` duration and correspond to older vehicles.

**Concrete actions:**

1. **Build predictive maintenance model**
   - Features from event log:
     - Cumulative km since last service.
     - Time since last maintenance.
     - Daily stop-and-go ratio.
     - Average operating temperature (if available).
   - Outcome:
     - Probability of breakdown in the next X days.
   - Use this to:
     - Prioritize vehicles for preemptive maintenance.
     - Schedule maintenance when vehicles are under less demand.

2. **Dynamic vehicle allocation**
   - Assign newer or more reliable vehicles to critical long or time-sensitive routes.
   - Allocation rules based on:
     - Reliability score from predictive model.
     - Route difficulty (distance, traffic intensity).

3. **Feedback loop to maintenance policy**
   - Evaluate whether current maintenance intervals are too long/short.
   - Adjust intervals based on failure pattern analysis.

**Expected KPI impacts:**

- Lower Unscheduled Breakdown Rate, improved OTD.
- Reduced overtime and emergency towing costs.
- Higher vehicle utilization (less downtime).
- Over time, lower total maintenance cost per km (less severe repairs).

---

### Strategy 4: Driver Performance Management & Training (bonus)

**Targeted inefficiency/bottleneck:**
- Uneven performance across drivers: slow service times, excessive idle, non-adherence to route plan.

**Root cause:**
- Different driving/servicing habits; possible skill gaps; lack of feedback on actual performance.

**Process mining insights supporting it:**

- Driver-level analysis shows:
  - Some drivers consistently spend 20–30% more time per stop.
  - Others show higher idle time before/after customer stops.
- Conformance shows:
  - Some drivers frequently reorder stops or take detours not explained by traffic.
- Stop subprocess reveals:
  - Variants with additional steps (e.g., extra waiting) more frequent with certain drivers.

**Concrete actions:**

1. **Driver scorecards**
   - For each driver, track metrics:
     - Average service time per stop (controlling for customer mix).
     - Idle time share.
     - Route adherence.
     - On-time rate for their routes.
   - Present as dashboards with peer benchmarks.

2. **Targeted coaching**
   - Use process traces to show:
     - How top performers execute similar routes more efficiently.
   - Focus training on:
     - Efficient customer interaction.
     - Better parking strategies.
     - Use of navigation and adherence to updated routes.

3. **Incentive schemes**
   - Reward improvements in KPIs (balanced so that safety is never compromised).

**Expected KPI impacts:**

- Reduced average service time and idle time.
- Higher OTD and lower cost per stop.
- More consistent performance across teams.

## 5. Operational Constraints & Continuous Monitoring

### 5.1 Accounting for constraints

All proposed optimizations must respect:

1. **Driver working time regulations**
   - Ensure route redesign and dynamic routing:
     - Respect daily/weekly driving and working hour limits.
     - Include mandated breaks.
   - Integrate driver-hours limits as constraints in the optimization model.
   - Use event log to validate:
     - Actual working time vs legal limit, overtime occurrence.

2. **Vehicle capacity constraints**
   - Route optimization must respect:
     - Max weight/volume per vehicle.
     - Load/unload times at depot.
   - Use historical loading patterns to:
     - Better balance load across vehicles (avoid under/overloaded routes).
   - Process mining can flag:
     - Cases where capacity is regularly exceeded or underutilized.

3. **Customer time windows**
   - OTD analysis must be based on these windows.
   - Dynamic routing:
     - Must treat time windows as hard or soft constraints. If soft, assign penalties in optimization.
   - Use historical adherence to:
     - Decide where windows can be tightened or need to be relaxed.

4. **Business rules**
   - Preferred drivers for certain customers.
   - Restrictions on nighttime deliveries in residential zones.
   - Include these in optimization and validate via conformance checking.

### 5.2 Continuous monitoring with process mining

After implementation, set up **dashboards and periodic analyses**:

**Core dashboards:**

1. **Operational performance overview**
   - Daily/weekly:
     - On-Time Delivery Rate.
     - Number of stops, kms, operating hours per vehicle/driver.
     - TravelTime vs ServiceTime ratio.
   - Trend lines to detect deterioration or improvements.

2. **Cost dashboard**
   - Fuel per km/package.
   - Maintenance cost per km and per vehicle.
   - Overtime hours.

3. **Exception dashboard**
   - Routes with:
     - High delay.
     - High failure rate.
     - Unscheduled stops/breakdowns.
   - Drill-down ability to see the process trace.

4. **Conformance dashboard**
   - Planned vs actual:
     - Stop sequence adherence.
     - Time deviation from planned ETAs.
   - Filter by route, area, driver.

5. **Customer-centric view**
   - Failure rate and OTD per customer/segment.
   - Re-delivery volume and associated cost.

**Monitoring process:**

- **Monthly / quarterly process discovery refresh**
  - Re-run discovery and compare models over time:
    - Measure if incidence of bottleneck activities has decreased.
  - Identify new patterns (e.g., new traffic hotspots).

- **A/B testing of changes**
  - For example, apply dynamic routing to a subset of routes.
  - Compare KPIs vs control group using process mining, isolating the effect of the change.

- **Alerting**
  - Automated alerts when:
    - OTD drops below threshold for a route or depot.
    - Traffic delay exceeds normal range (using historical baseline).
    - Breakdown probability exceeds threshold for particular vehicles (from predictive model).

This continuous loop—collect  analyze  improve  monitor—keeps the process optimized and allows early detection of emerging issues (e.g., new construction causing detours, changes in customer behavior).

---

**In summary:** By carefully integrating multi-source event data, using process discovery and conformance checking to compare plan vs reality, quantifying performance and bottlenecks, and then implementing targeted strategies (time-dependent routing, failure reduction, predictive maintenance, driver performance programs), Speedy Parcels can meaningfully improve on-time deliveries and reduce fuel and maintenance costs, while respecting legal and operational constraints and continuously monitoring progress.
