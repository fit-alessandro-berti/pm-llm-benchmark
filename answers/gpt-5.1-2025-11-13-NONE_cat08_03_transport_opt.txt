### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

#### 1.1. Data preprocessing and integration

**Event log design**

I’d define **two main levels of analysis**:

1. **Vehicle-Day process (Case ID = VehicleID + Date)**  
   For depot  all tours  back to depot, including maintenance and breakdowns.  
2. **Stop/Package process (Case ID = Package ID or Stop ID)**  
   For customer-level performance (on-time delivery, failed attempts, service times).

You can keep both in one table (like your snippet) and derive separate logs via filtering.

**Core event attributes**

- `case_id`  
  - Vehicle-day (e.g., `V12-20241205`)  
  - Package/stop (e.g., `P9876`)
- `timestamp` (standardized to UTC, consistent format)
- `activity` (normalized labels, e.g., “Depart depot”, “Arrive customer”, “Delivery success”, “Unscheduled stop”, “Maintenance start”)
- `resource` (e.g., Driver ID)
- `additional attributes`:
  - Location (lat/lon, geohash, or mapped zone/area)
  - Speed
  - Source system (GPS / Scanner / Dispatch / Maintenance)
  - Vehicle ID, Route ID, planned vs. actual sequence/ETA
  - Distance from last GPS point (for fuel & utilization approximations)
  - Flags: unplanned stop, in traffic jam, breakdown, etc.

**Integration steps**

1. **Time normalization & quality checks**
   - Convert all timestamps to common timezone.
   - Remove or flag events with impossible timestamps (e.g., in the future, before vehicle assignment).
   - Ensure event ordering per case: sort by timestamp; if ties, use priority (Scanner > Dispatch > GPS, etc.).

2. **Event type harmonization**
   - Map raw codes to a unified activity taxonomy, e.g.:
     - Depot: `Start shift`, `Route assigned`, `Depart depot`, `Arrive depot`, `End shift`.
     - Travel: `Driving`, `Traffic delay`, `Unscheduled stop`.
     - Service: `Arrive customer`, `Delivery success`, `Delivery failed`, `Depart customer`.
     - Maintenance: `Maintenance start`, `Maintenance end`, `Breakdown`.

3. **Merging GPS with scanner & dispatch**
   - Use **temporal joins**:
     - Between scanner “Arrive customer” and nearest GPS point with speed  0 at the same location; store observed dwell time.
     - Between dispatch planned stops and scanner events via Package ID or address.  
   - Enrich each service event with:
     - **Planned arrival time** (from dispatch) and **planned sequence** number.
     - **Planned route segment** (e.g., Depot  Stop 1  Stop 2 …).
   - For GPS streams, you don’t want all points as “events” for classic process mining. Instead:
     - Aggregate into **meaningful events**:
       - “Start driving” when speed > x km/h after being idle.
       - “Traffic delay” when speed < y for > N minutes on a road segment.
       - “Unscheduled stop” when idle off-customer location for > threshold.

4. **Integrating maintenance logs**
   - Align maintenance events with vehicle-day cases via Vehicle ID and time.
   - Insert `Maintenance start` / `Maintenance end` into the vehicle-day timeline.
   - For breakdowns in-shift, ensure we capture:
     - Preceding event (e.g., “Engine warning” from telematics).
     - Consequences: missed stops, route truncation, delays.

**Challenges**

- **Event correlation**:
  - Multiple packages per stop, but only one physical visit: need to define a **Stop ID** to link all packages delivered at one location/time window.
- **Missing or noisy data**:
  - GPS dropouts, scanner events without matching GPS, or vice versa.
  - Late or missing “Depart customer” scans – must infer from movement.
- **Clock misalignment**:
  - Different device clocks out of sync; may require offset calibration using known anchor events (e.g., “Start shift” vs. “Depart depot”).
- **Granularity**:
  - GPS points are high frequency; process mining usually needs **macro-events**. Need aggregation rules that preserve process structure but keep logs manageable.

---

#### 1.2. Process discovery: actual end-to-end process

For **Vehicle-Day log**, I’d run algorithms like:

- **Inductive Miner** (for sound, interpretable models)
- **Heuristic Miner** (to see frequency-based paths and noise)

To capture:

- Typical sequence:
  - `Start shift  Route assigned  Depart depot  [Travel  Arrive customer  Delivery (success/fail)  Depart customer]*  Arrive depot  End shift`
- Common deviations and special paths:
  - Breakdowns: `Travel  Unscheduled stop (engine)  Maintenance start/end  Resume travel`.
  - Returns to depot mid-route (forgot parcels, reloading).
  - Long idle periods in non-customer locations.

On the **Package/Stop log**, discovery shows:

- `Scan at depot  Load vehicle  Travel  Arrive customer  (Delivery success | Delivery failed)  (Replanned | Return to depot)`  
- Variations for repeated delivery attempts (multi-day processes if you extend case across days).

I would also **segment discovery** by:

- Route type (urban vs. suburban)
- Day of week, time-of-day (AM vs. PM rounds)
- Vehicle type (electric vs. diesel, capacity class)
- Driver (to see behavioral variants)

This yields “as-is” maps with frequencies and durations on edges and activities.

---

#### 1.3. Conformance checking vs. planned routes

Use **conformance checking** (token-based replay or alignment-based) to compare:

- **Reference model**: derived from dispatch/route-planning:
  - Planned sequence of stops.
  - Planned travel times and time windows per stop.
- **Observed model**: discovered from logs.

Key deviations to analyze:

1. **Sequence deviations**
   - Stops served in different order than planned (out-of-sequence deliveries).
   - Skipped or never-visited planned stops within a vehicle-day.
   - Extra stops not in original plan (e.g., unscheduled breaks, refueling, mid-route depot returns).

2. **Timing deviations**
   - **Early/late departure from depot** vs. plan.
   - Travel times per leg: actual vs. planned (systematic underestimation of travel time on certain road segments or time-of-day).
   - Service time at customer: planned vs. actual dwell duration.
   - Violations of customer time windows (early or late deliveries).

3. **Performance deviations**
   - Excessive idle times between planned activities (e.g., waiting for loading at depot, queueing).
   - Proportion of route duration spent in traffic congestion vs. moving vs. at customer locations.

4. **Structural deviations**
   - Routes that are significantly longer (extra legs: depot detours, cross-territory stops).
   - Breakdowns & maintenance not visible in planning but present in execution.

Outcome: a **deviation score per route/day/driver**, and a breakdown of deviation types to guide improvement efforts.

---

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

#### 2.1. KPIs and how to compute them

From the event log:

1. **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR)**
   - For each package/stop:
     - Compare `Actual delivery timestamp` (success) with:
       - requested customer time window from dispatch (earliest, latest).
     - On time if `within [earliest, latest]` (or with defined tolerance).
   - KPI:
     - OTDR = (# on-time deliveries) / (total deliveries).

2. **Average Time per Delivery Stop**
   - For each service stop:
     - `Service time = Depart customer - Arrive customer` (from scanner events, or from GPS if missing).
   - Compute mean, median, distribution by:
     - Route, driver, zone, customer type (B2B, B2C).

3. **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio**
   - Per vehicle-day:
     - `Total travel time`: sum of intervals with speed > threshold.
     - `Total service time`: sum of service times at customers.
   - Ratio = Travel time / Service time.  
   - High ratio indicates potential territory or route-structure inefficiency.

4. **Fuel Consumption per km / package**
   - Join with fuel card/telemetry (if available) or estimate via:
     - Fuel = distance * vehicle-specific consumption rate.
   - KPIs:
     - Fuel per km = Fuel / total distance.
     - Fuel per package = Fuel / delivered packages.

5. **Vehicle Utilization Rate**
   - Time-based:
     - `(Driving + Service) / (Shift duration)`.
   - Capacity-based:
     - Average load factor = `delivered packages / capacity` (or by volume/weight if available).

6. **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays**
   - Identify “Traffic delay” events from GPS (speed < X for > N minutes on known congested segments).
   - Metrics:
     - Average delay minutes per route/day/zone.
     - Fraction of travel time spent under congestion conditions.

7. **Rate of Failed Deliveries**
   - `Failed attempts / total stops`.
   - Break down by:
     - Time-of-day, customer segment, driver, area, day-of-week.
   - Also measure average additional distance/time caused by re-deliveries.

8. **Breakdown/maintenance impact**
   - # of breakdown events per 10k km.
   - Average lost time due to breakdown per incident.
   - Correlate with mileage, vehicle age, route characteristics.

All these can be aggregated in dashboards across different dimensions (driver, vehicle, route, region, weekday).

---

#### 2.2. Bottleneck identification via process mining

Techniques and what to look for:

1. **Performance-enhanced process maps**
   - Overlay average and percentile durations on:
     - Edges: `Depart depot  Arrive first customer`, `Depart customer  Arrive next customer`.
     - Nodes: `Arrive customer`, `Traffic delay`, `Maintenance start`.
   - Bottlenecks:
     - Long average duration edges.
     - Activities with high waiting before/after.

2. **Variant analysis**
   - Compare top route execution variants:
     - Fast vs. slow routes (same planned route, different performance).
     - Drivers using different sequences or behaviors (e.g., different order of dense stops).
   - Differences reveal potential best practices or problematic patterns.

3. **Filtering and segmentation**
   - Time-of-day filter:
     - Discover process model for morning vs. afternoon; compare performance.
   - Region filter:
     - Identify particular zones with extra idle time (parking search, complex access).
   - Vehicle type:
     - EVs vs. diesel – differences in route durations, breakdowns, range-related detours.

4. **Bottleneck categories & quantification**

   - **Route-related bottlenecks**
     - Repeated routes showing:
       - Long travel times on certain legs vs. planning.
       - Many traffic delay events on specific road segments.
     - Quantify:
       - Average delay minutes per route leg.
       - Extra distance driven vs. planned.

   - **Temporal bottlenecks**
     - Peaks in lateness around certain hours.
     - Longer service times at specific times (e.g., mid-day parking scarcity).
     - Quantify:
       - On-time rate per time window.
       - Median service time by hour of day.

   - **Driver-related bottlenecks**
     - Use resource analysis:
       - Compare drivers with similar territories.
       - Per-driver averages: OTDR, stops/hour, idle time %, failed delivery rate.
     - Quantify:
       - Performance gap between top and bottom quartiles.

   - **Vehicle-related bottlenecks**
     - Vehicles with more frequent:
       - Unscheduled stops.
       - Slow segments due to mechanical limits or breakdown patterns.
     - Quantify:
       - Extra downtime per vehicle.
       - KPI impact: missed deliveries, overtime hours.

   - **Activity-specific bottlenecks**
     - Long times from `Arrive customer  Delivery success` (e.g., access procedures, complex handovers).
     - Use detailed log to see where service time is excessive.
     - Quantify:
       - Additional minutes per stop vs. benchmark; extrapolate to fleet-level cost.

The impact can be quantified as:

- Lost stops per day (time at bottleneck / average stop time).
- Extra fuel cost from detours or repeated attempts.
- Overtime hours attributable to particular patterns.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

Now move from “where” to “why”.

#### 3.1. Potential root causes

1. **Suboptimal route planning (static vs. dynamic)**
   - Indicators:
     - Planned travel times consistently shorter than actual during rush hours.
     - Frequent reordering of planned stop sequence by drivers to “fix” unrealistic plans.
   - Process mining support:
     - Conformance deviations: many out-of-sequence deliveries.
     - Systematic positive delay (planned vs. actual) on specific legs/time ranges.

2. **Inaccurate travel time estimations**
   - Indicators:
     - High residuals between planned vs. actual travel time across many days.
     - Patterns by time-of-day, weekday, or road segment.
   - Process mining support:
     - Alignments with time annotations; per-leg error distributions.

3. **Traffic congestion patterns**
   - Indicators:
     - Clusters of “Traffic delay” events on same road segments & hours.
   - Process mining support:
     - Map events on GIS; overlay traffic delay frequency and duration.
     - Process maps filtered to those legs; show strong time-of-day dependence.

4. **High variability in service time at customer locations**
   - Drivers spending variable time per stop due to:
     - Parking difficulty.
     - Building access / security procedures.
     - Customer interactions (e.g., cash on delivery, signatures).
   - Process mining support:
     - Distribution of `Arrive  Depart customer` times per customer/location type.
     - Outliers and systematic differences by area, customer segment.

5. **Vehicle breakdowns / maintenance during shifts**

       - Start time punctuality.
       - Adherence to sequences.
       - Excessive unscheduled breaks.
       - Tendency to push risky tight timing vs. conservative patterns.

7. **Issues with failed delivery attempts**
   - Indicators:
     - High rates of “Delivery failed (Customer not home)” in certain slots or customer types.
     - Many re-delivery processes; packages appearing in multiple vehicle-day cases.
   - Process mining support:
     - Multi-day process analysis per Package ID:
       - `Attempt 1 failed  Return depot  Attempt 2  ...`
     - Quantify extra time, distance, and cost per additional attempt.
     - Correlate with time-of-day, communication (if notification events exist).

#### 3.2. Process mining analyses to validate root causes

1. **Variant analysis: high vs. low performers**
   - Compare models and performance metrics for:
     - Top 20% vs. bottom 20% drivers (controlling for region & route difficulty).
   - Inspect:
     - Time at depot before first departure.
     - Number & duration of unscheduled stops.
     - Sequence adherence.
   - Validates whether behavior patterns (rather than plan) explain differences.

2. **Correlation of traffic data with delays**
   - Map travel segments to road segments with typical travel-time profiles by hour.
   - Compare logs vs. external traffic data or build your own from history.
   - Show that certain segments at specific hours systematically cause lateness in downstream deliveries.

3. **Dwell time analysis at customers**
   - For each customer type or area:
     - Distribution of service times.
   - Use clustering:
     - Identify clusters: “Quick stops” vs. “Long dwell” customers.
   - Examine correlation with:
     - Building type, dense city center vs. suburb.
     - Time-of-day (parking availability).

4. **Maintenance and breakdown pattern analysis**
   - Process mining on **maintenance processes**:
     - `Usage period  Breakdown  Repair  Return`.
   - Identify:
     - Vehicles with shortened usage cycles.
   - Correlate:
     - Breakdown frequency with time since last preventive maintenance, route typology (steep, rough, stop-and-go).

5. **Re-delivery process analysis**
   - For packages with multiple attempts:
     - Build process models of full lifecycle: `Plan  Attempt1  Failure reason  Re-plan  Attempt2  ...`.
   - Quantify:
     - Extra days until successful delivery.
     - Extra distance/time per package.
   - Validate root causes:
     - Coincidence of failed deliveries with poorly chosen time windows or lack of customer notifications.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Below are **five concrete strategies**; you asked for 3.

#### Strategy 1 – Dynamic, congestion-aware routing and better travel-time estimates

**Targeted inefficiencies**

- Late deliveries due to underestimated travel times.
- Excess time in traffic congestion.
- Last-minute out-of-sequence changes by drivers.

**Root cause**

- Static route planning not reflecting actual congestion patterns by time-of-day.
- Planning engine using generic or outdated travel-time estimates.

**Process mining support**

- From conformance checking and performance analysis:
  - Identify route segments where actual travel time is consistently higher than planned by >X%.
  - Identify time-dependent patterns (e.g., 8–9 a.m. corridors with 2× planned times).
- Build **historical travel-time distributions per segment & time-of-day** from GPS logs.

**Proposed changes**

- Feed empirical travel-time profiles into the route planner:
  - Adjust expected speeds per road segment and hour of day.
- Implement **mid-day re-optimization**:
  - At breakpoints (e.g., after first 10 stops), re-evaluate route given:
    - Current delays.
    - Predicted congestion ahead.
    - Remaining time windows.
- Provide drivers with updated sequences via mobile app.

**Expected impact on KPIs**

- Higher OTDR (fewer late deliveries due to better estimation and dynamic rerouting).
- Reduced travel time vs. service time ratio (less wasted time in congestion).
- Potentially lower fuel per package (more efficient routing), or at least controlled.

---

#### Strategy 2 – Territory and route-sequence optimization based on historical performance

**Targeted inefficiencies**

- Excessive travel time between stops.
- Routes with too many stops or unrealistic geographic spreads.
- High travel / low service time ratio.

**Root cause**

- Territories defined traditionally (e.g., postal codes) rather than actual workload patterns.
- Route sequences not optimized using actual stop durations and travel patterns.

**Process mining support**

- Use logs to:
  - Compute **average service time per customer/area**.
  - Compute **average travel time between stop pairs** (actual vs. planned).
- Identify:
  - Highly fragmented routes crossing multiple dense zones.
  - Overloaded routes which consistently require overtime.

**Proposed changes**

- **Re-cluster customers** into territories:
  - Optimize for total travel time, balancing:
    - Number of stops.
    - Expected total service time.
    - Vehicle capacity.
- Use historical **stop-specific service times** and **travel-time matrices** to build realistic daily route capacities.
- For dense urban areas:
  - Sequence stops to minimize backtracking and avoid known bottleneck roads at bad times.

**Expected impact on KPIs**

- Better vehicle utilization:
  - More balanced daily workloads  fewer overtime events.
- Lower travel time / service time ratio:
  - More time spent delivering, less criss-crossing.
- Improved OTDR:
  - Routes less likely to run late at the end of the day.

---

#### Strategy 3 – Improve time window management & reduce failed deliveries

**Targeted inefficiencies**

- High rate of failed deliveries (customer not home).
- Costly re-delivery attempts and extended package lifecycles.

**Root cause**

- Time windows not aligned with actual customer availability patterns.
- Insufficient customer communication (no advance notice, poor rescheduling options).

**Process mining support**

- Analyze failed deliveries:
  - Time-of-day and day-of-week patterns for “Customer not home” events.
  - Customers with repeated failures.
- Identify:
  - When first attempts are most likely to succeed by customer type.
  - Average number of attempts per delivery segment; cost per extra attempt.

**Proposed changes**

- Use observed success/failure times to propose **smarter time windows**:
  - Offer standard slots that align with high-success periods for similar customers.
- Introduce or improve:
  - Proactive notifications (e.g., SMS with expected time, allowing reschedule).
  - Option for alternative drop (pickup points, neighbors) where legal and accepted.
- Adjust route planning:
  - Plan “high-risk” customers at times of historically higher presence.

**Expected impact on KPIs**

- Lower **Failed delivery rate**.
- Fewer re-delivery attempts  lower fuel per package and less time per package.
- Improved OTDR (first-attempt success rate increases).
- Reduced total route duration on days with many failures today.

---

#### Strategy 4 – Predictive and condition-based maintenance

**Targeted inefficiencies**

- Unexpected breakdowns causing route disruption and overtime.
- Higher long-term maintenance costs from reactive repairs.

**Root cause**

- Maintenance schedules not aligned with actual usage patterns and driving conditions.
- No prediction from minor warning events to major failures.

**Process mining support**

- From vehicle & maintenance logs:
  - Build processes linking:
    - Driving patterns  warning events  breakdowns  repairs.
  - Identify clusters of:
    - Vehicle-days with engine warnings followed by breakdowns within X days.
- Correlate breakdowns with:
  - Mileage since last service.
  - Type of routes (hilly, city stop-and-go).
  - Overloading (if weight data exists).

**Proposed changes**

- Develop **risk scores per vehicle**:
  - Based on distance since last maintenance, frequency of minor warnings, harsh driving patterns.
- Trigger preventive maintenance:
  - Before predicted high-risk period (e.g., before heavy seasonal peaks).
- Use predictive insights to:
  - Assign more fragile vehicles to less demanding routes until maintenance.

**Expected impact on KPIs**

- Fewer breakdown-related “Unscheduled stops”.
- Higher OTDR (fewer severely disrupted routes).
- Better vehicle utilization (less unplanned downtime).
- Potential reduction in long-term maintenance costs.

---

#### Strategy 5 – Targeted driver coaching & standard operating procedures

**Targeted inefficiencies**

- Performance gaps between drivers.
- Extra idle time, unscheduled breaks, inefficient sequences.

**Root cause**

- Different driving and working practices:
  - Departure punctuality, handling of difficult stops, parking strategies.
- Lack of standardized best practices diffusion.

**Process mining support**

- Resource-level performance dashboards:
  - OTDR, stops/hour, service time per stop, idle time %, failed delivery rate per driver.
- Variant comparison:
  - Process models of high-performing vs. low-performing drivers on similar routes, showing:
    - Different patterns of unscheduled stops.
    - Different sequencing of same-stop sets.
    - Differences in time spent at depot in the morning.

**Proposed changes**

- Identify and codify **best practices** from top performers:
  - Example: grouping difficult stops earlier, consistent morning departure times, efficient scanning routines.
- Design **driver coaching** and training:
  - Individual feedback sessions with concrete metrics.
  - Simple guidelines (leave depot by X, limit personal breaks, recommended route adherence).
- Incentive schemes tied to balanced KPIs:
  - On-time rate, safe driving (if data available), and fuel efficiency.

**Expected impact on KPIs**

- Narrowed gap in driver performance; uplift of lower half toward median.
- Improve OTDR and reduce idle time.
- Potential fuel reduction from smoother driving patterns if telematics used.

---

### 5. Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring

#### 5.1. Accounting for operational constraints

Any optimizations must explicitly respect:

1. **Driver working hours & labor regulations**
   - Ensure route planning and dynamic rerouting:
     - Respect max shift duration, driving time limits, rest breaks.
   - Include these constraints directly into:
     - Optimization models (e.g., VRP with time windows and working-time constraints).
   - Process mining helps validate:
     - Empirically that no systematic violation occurs (e.g., overtime patterns by route).

2. **Vehicle capacities & characteristics**
   - Route design must respect:
     - Weight/volume capacity.
     - EV ranges and charging times if applicable.
   - Use logs to:
     - Estimate actual load usage over time.
   - Tailor:
     - Heavier routes to more robust vehicles.

3. **Customer time windows & service constraints**
   - Use window constraints as hard or soft depending on contractual rules.
   - Dynamic routing must avoid:
     - Creating new time-window violations downstream.
   - Process mining validates:
     - That time-window compliance improves; no new failure mode appears.

4. **Legal & safety constraints**
   - Speed limits and safe driving, loading/unloading constraints in certain zones.
   - If telematics includes harsh braking or speeding, integrate for safer optimization.

All recommended strategies need to be implemented via tools (routing engine, dispatch rules) that encode these constraints.

---

#### 5.2. Continuous monitoring with process mining dashboards

Once changes are implemented, set up **ongoing monitoring** with:

**Key metrics to track**

- **Service & punctuality**
  - OTDR overall & by:
    - Route, driver, region, time-of-day.
  - First-attempt success rate vs. re-deliveries.
- **Operational efficiency**
  - Travel time / service time ratio per route.
  - Stops/hour per driver/route type.
  - Fuel per km and per package.
- **Reliability & maintenance**
  - # of breakdowns and unscheduled stops per 10k km.
  - Mean time between failures (MTBF) per vehicle.
  - Share of routes disrupted by maintenance events.
- **Compliance & behavior**
  - Sequence adherence to planned route.
  - Overtime frequency and duration.
  - Unscheduled stop frequency and average duration.

**Process views**

1. **Before/After comparison**
   - Baseline vs post-change:
     - Process maps with throughput times and volumes.
     - KPI trend lines showing improvements or regressions.

2. **Route performance view**
   - For each route pattern:
     - Avg delay vs. plan.
     - Typical bottleneck segments.
   - Flag routes with persistent problems for further adjustment.

3. **Driver performance view**
   - Resource-based dashboards:
     - Ranking by OTDR, stops/hour, idle time %, fuel efficiency.
   - Alerts when:
     - Performance falls below thresholds, signaling training or route mismatch.

4. **Exception & alert view**
   - Automatic detection of:
     - Sudden spikes in failed deliveries or breakdowns.
     - New areas with rising traffic delays.
   - Use conformance metrics:
     - Alert when deviation scores exceed acceptable ranges.

5. **Maintenance & health view**
   - Timeline of maintenance events & predicted risk.
   - Vehicles approaching high-risk thresholds for preventive action.

**Governance**

- Regular review cycles:
  - Weekly operational review: drivers, dispatchers, route planners.
  - Monthly strategic review: territory design, maintenance policies.
- Continuous feedback loop:
  - Use insights from monitoring to:
    - Further refine travel-time profiles.
    - Adjust driver training content.
    - Update routing rules and capacity assumptions.

---

This approach combines rigorous event-log preparation, process discovery, conformance checking, and KPI-driven analysis with targeted optimization strategies and an ongoing monitoring loop. It uses the data Speedy Parcels already collects to turn their operations into a measurable, continuously improving process rather than a black box.
