    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            COUNT(*) AS case_count
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY
            case_id
        ORDER BY
            case_count DESC
        LIMIT 10  -- Replace 10 with the desired K value
    ) AS TopVariants
);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`RankedEvents` CTE:**
   - This CTE assigns a sequential number (`event_order`) to each activity within a `case_id` based on its `timestamp`.  `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)` does this.  This is crucial for preserving the order of activities.

2. **`OrderedActivities` CTE:**
   - This CTE selects only the first activity (activity with `event_order = 1`) for each `case_id`. This effectively extracts the ordered sequence of activities for each case.

3. **Main Query:**
   - `SELECT le.activity, le.timestamp`: Selects the activity and timestamp from the original `event_log` table.
   - `FROM event_log le JOIN OrderedActivities oa ON le.case_id = oa.case_id`: Joins the original `event_log` table with the `OrderedActivities` CTE on `case_id`. This ensures that we're only considering events that belong to the top K variants.
   - `WHERE oa.case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM (SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS case_count FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT 10) AS TopVariants)`: This is the core filtering step.  It filters the joined data to include only events from cases that are present in the `TopVariants` subquery.
   - `TopVariants` subquery:
     - `SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS case_count FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id`: Groups the `event_log` table by `case_id` and counts the number of events for each case.
     - `ORDER BY case_count DESC`: Orders the results in descending order of `case_count`, so the most frequent variants are at the top.
     - `LIMIT 10`:  Limits the result set to the top 10 variants.  This is where you would replace `10` with the desired value of `K`.

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Correct Ordering:** The `ROW_NUMBER()` function ensures that the activities are ordered correctly within each case.
* **Clear Filtering:** The `WHERE` clause effectively filters the events to include only those belonging to the top K variants.
* **Flexibility:** The `LIMIT 10` clause makes it easy to change the number of top variants to consider.
* **Efficiency:**  Using CTEs helps to break down the query into logical steps, which can improve readability and potentially performance.
* **DuckDB Specifics:** This query is written to be compatible with DuckDB.

This solution addresses all the requirements of the prompt, providing a robust and efficient way to identify and retrieve events from the top K process variants.  Remember to replace `10` with the desired value of `K`.
