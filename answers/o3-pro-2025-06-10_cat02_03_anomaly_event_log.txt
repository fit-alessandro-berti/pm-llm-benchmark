Below is a short “reference” P2P sequence followed by an assessment of every case in the log.

Typical (text-book) Procure-to-Pay order of work  
1. Create Purchase Requisition (PR)  
2. Approve PR (budget / policy check)  
3. Issue Purchase Order (PO) to supplier  
4. Goods / services received (Goods Receipt, GR)  
5. Vendor invoice received  
6. 3-way match (PO-GR-Invoice)  
7. Release / execute payment  
8. Close the case  

Any reversal of the above order (or suspiciously short time gaps) is normally flagged by internal control, external audit or an ERP “workflow” rule.

Case-by-case review
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Case 1001 – “Happy path” (no anomaly)  
All steps follow the expected order with sensible time gaps.

Case 1002 – Several critical violations  
1. PO issued before the PR is approved  
   • PO at 08:40 on 1-Feb, PR only approved two days later (3-Feb 08:00).  
   • A purchase commitment is made without budgetary/management sign-off.

2. Invoice arrives and is paid before either PR approval or goods receipt  
   • Invoice received 3-Feb 07:00 and payment released 3-Feb 07:15.  
   • Goods are not received until 4-Feb and 3-way match happens 5-Feb.  
   • Paying before the 3-way match defeats the principal internal control in P2P and exposes the organisation to duplicate, inflated or fraudulent invoices.

3. Extremely short “invoice-to-payment” time (15 minutes)  
   • In real-life banking cycles a same-day payment may be exceptional; 15 minutes strongly suggests the invoice bypassed normal approval or payment run batches.

Case 1003 – “Pre-payment” without evidence of liability  
1. Payment released before an invoice is even on file (8-Feb vs 9-Feb)  
   • The company pays money without a legal claim (no invoice).

2. Payment long before goods receipt or 3-way match  
   • Goods received 10-Feb, match 11-Feb – both after payment.  
   • This is essentially an unsecured advance; if the vendor fails to deliver, recovery is uncertain.

3. Invoice arrives after payment  
   • In most ERPs this would only be possible if manual overrides were used or if the system is configured to allow “down-payments”; both require special justification and tight monitoring.

Case 1004 – “Goods first, paperwork later”  
1. Goods receipt precedes PO creation (6-Feb 09:00 vs PO 09:15)  
   • Indicates maverick buying or retro-active ordering (“After-the-fact PO”), which undermines spend control and contract leveraging.

2. Although invoice, match and payment are in the correct internal order, the whole chain starts with an uncontrolled delivery.  
   • Risk: supplier could dictate prices/terms once the organisation is already in possession of the goods.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Why the highlighted behaviours are problematic

• Compliance & audit risk – SOX, ISO-based controls, and virtually all audit frameworks expect “authorisation before commitment” and “3-way match before payment.”  
• Financial risk – Paying before receipt/match can lead to over-payment, duplicate payment or payment for undelivered goods.  
• Operational risk – Goods received without a PO can result in wrong quantities/specifications and complicate inventory valuation.  
• Fraud risk – Very rapid invoice-to-payment cycles (minutes) or payments without invoices are classic red flags for collusion or fictitious vendors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of anomalies

• Case 1002: PO before PR approval; invoice & payment before approval, GR and match; 15-minute invoice-to-cash-out.  
• Case 1003: Payment before invoice, GR and match (unsecured pre-payment).  
• Case 1004: Goods receipt before PO (after-the-fact ordering/maverick spend).  

Only Case 1001 follows standard P2P best practice.
