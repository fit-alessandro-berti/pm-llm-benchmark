### Analysis of POWL Models Relative to Standard Hire-to-Retire Process

The standard (normative) Hire-to-Retire process follows a logical, sequential flow reflecting real-world hiring logic:
1. **Post_Job_Ad** (initiate recruitment).
2. **Screen_Candidates** (filter applicants; precedes interviews/decisions).
3. **Conduct_Interviews** (assess shortlisted candidates; precedes decisions).
4. **Make_Hiring_Decision** (outcome of prior steps; if positive, proceed to onboarding).
5. **Onboard_Employee** (integrate hire; single execution per employee).
6. **Add_to_Payroll** (mandatory post-onboarding step for compensation).
7. **Close_Case** (finalize after payroll).

Key logical invariants:
- Strict precedence: Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close.
- No parallelism between sequential steps (e.g., screen before interview).
- No optionality or loops on core hiring steps (e.g., single onboarding, mandatory payroll if hired).
- All activities occur exactly once per case.

Both models use **StrictPartialOrder**, enforcing that **all nodes execute in every trace** while respecting precedences (parallelism allowed only if unordered).

#### Anomalies in Model 1
- **Precedences**: Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close (correct). Screen  Interview (good, but Interview has no successors).
- **Key deviation**: No order between **Interview** and **Decide** (both directly after Screen).
  - Possible traces:
    - Correct: Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close.
    - Anomalous: Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close  Interview (interview *after* hiring/onboarding).
    - Anomalous: Post  Screen  Interview || Decide  Onboard... (parallel interview/decision).
- **Severity**: **Minor**. Screening correctly precedes both interview/decision (logical). Onboarding/payroll/closing chain intact. Only violates "interview before decision" invariant, allowing suboptimal traces (e.g., decide without/ before interview). Does not break core hiring integrity (e.g., no skipped payroll, no late screening).

#### Anomalies in Model 2
- **Precedences**: Post  Screen (isolated; no successors). Post  Interview  Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close.
  - **loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip)**: Executes Onboard at least once, then optionally repeats (silent skip loops back). Traces: Onboard; Onboard  skip  Onboard; etc.
  - **xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip)**: Exclusive choice—either Payroll or silent skip (no payroll).
- **Key deviations**:
  1. No order between **Screen** and **Interview/Decide** (only shared Post predecessor).
     - Possible: Post  Interview  Decide  Onboard...  Screen (screen *after* hiring).
  2. **LOOP on Onboard**: Allows 1+ executions (e.g., repeated onboardings for one hire).
  3. **Optional Payroll**: Can skip Payroll entirely (Onboard  skip  Close).
  4. Interview correctly precedes Decide, but screening does not.
- **Severity**: **Severe**. Fundamentally breaks process logic:
  - Screening (essential filter) can occur post-hiring (violates causality).
  - Multiple onboardings illogical for single-employee process.
  - Skipping payroll after onboarding creates integrity issues (hired employee not compensated, case closed inconsistently).
  - Silent transitions obscure traces but enable bad paths.

| Aspect                  | Normative | Model 1 Deviation | Model 2 Deviation |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Post  Screen          |         | None             | None             |
| Screen  Interview     |         | None             |  (parallel/late Screen) |
| Interview  Decide     |         |  (unordered)   |                 |
| Decide  Onboard       |         |                 |  (but looped)   |
| Onboard (exactly once) |         |                 |  (LOOP, 1+)    |
| Payroll (mandatory)    |         |                 |  (optional XOR)|
| Payroll  Close        |         |                 |  (if executed)  |
| Overall Integrity      | Strict seq. | Minor flexibility | Major optionality/parallelism |

### Which Model is Closer to Normative?
**Model 1 more closely aligns** with the normative Hire-to-Retire process.

**Justification**:
- **Correctness**: Model 1 preserves ~85% of precedences exactly (e.g., screening gates interview/decision; decision gates onboarding/payroll/closing). Anomalies are confined to one unordered pair (Interview || Decide), allowing rare illogical traces but never skipping core steps or decoupling essentials (e.g., Screen always before Decide/Onboard; Payroll mandatory post-Onboard).
- **Integrity**: No optionality/loops risk inconsistent states (e.g., hired without payroll). All activities causally tied except one flexibility.
- **Model 2's flaws compound**: Late/parallel screening breaks recruitment causality (hire without vetting). Optional payroll post-onboarding creates compliance risks (unpaid employee). Looped onboarding defies single-hire logic. These are **fundamental violations**, enabling invalid end-states (e.g., closed case with unpaid/onboarded employee or post-hire screening).
- **Proximity metric**: Model 1 requires 1 fix (add Interview  Decide). Model 2 needs 4+ (add Screen  Interview; remove LOOP/XOR; reorder/add edges). Model 1's deviation is "good practice" (suboptimal ordering) vs. Model 2's "broken process" (invalid paths).
