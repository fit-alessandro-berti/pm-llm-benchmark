**Logic Explanation:**

The system log provides a chronological sequence of user actions, including focus changes, typing, saves, switches between applications, clicks, scrolls, and close events. To transform this into a coherent process mining event log, I followed these steps:

1. **Case Identification:** Each action sequence starting from "Focus Document" to subsequent activities until the next focus change or closing an application is grouped into Case 1. This represents a logical work session, likely editing a specific document (Document1.docx and Quarterly_Report.docx).

2. **Activity Naming:** Raw actions like "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SWITCH," "CLICK," and "SCROLL" were translated into more descriptive activity names like "Focus Document," "Typing Content," "Switch to Email," "Click Email," etc., making the events meaningful for process analysis.

3. **Event Attributes:** I included a unique Case ID, an Activity Name, and the original timestamp. Additional attributes such as application names and window titles were added where relevant to provide context.

The resulting event log provides a structured representation of user work sessions, with each case representing a coherent unit of work, allowing for further process analysis and insights using standard process mining tools.
