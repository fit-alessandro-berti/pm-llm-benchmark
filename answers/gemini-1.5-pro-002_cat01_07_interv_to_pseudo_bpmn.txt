Notes:

* The Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) plays a supporting role in resolving discrepancies related to invoice details and PO matching but doesn’t directly participate in core process activities.
* The Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) handles exceptions and escalations but isn't part of the regular flow unless a problem arises. 
* Some invoices might not have a PO initially (e.g., informal service contracts).  In such cases, the Accounts Payable Supervisor works with department heads to create a retrospective PO or reject the invoice. This exception path merges back into the main process after the PO issue is addressed.
