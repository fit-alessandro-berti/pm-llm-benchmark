Here is a concise description of what the visualization shows.

- Overall idea
  - It illustrates two proclet classes that communicate through channels in a laboratory-workflow scenario. The idea comes from the proclet approach to distributed processes: modular process units (proclets) talk to each other via channels.

- Left part (a) – two proclet classes connected by two channels
  - The two proclets are “Order system” and, effectively, the lab-testing flow (the steps inside are split between what the order system does and what the lab test does).
  - The left side shows actors (doctor, lab assistant) and the sequence of activities: order entry, taking a blood sample, receiving results, judging results, deciding whether to run tests again, sending/receiving updated results, and sending a final report.
  - The right side shows the lab-test activities: perform test, make report, finish lab test, provide updated report, etc.
  - The two channels (dashed connectors) link the two proclets. The multiplicities (for example 1..* and 1..1) indicate how many messages can flow in each direction (one-to-many and one-to-one interactions).
  - Dashed boxes around the middle indicate the “Order system” proclet; the flow arrows indicate which steps belong to which proclet and how they interoperate.

- Bottom table (Example of a performative)
  - A small example table shows a concrete message exchange: time, channel, sender, receivers, action, content, scope, and direction.
  - Example entry: a message created by the Order system to the Lab visit/Lab test with content like “Can you perform a HGB test for John?” This illustrates the format of the communications between proclets.

- Right part (b) – class diagram
  - A simplified class diagram that contains the two proclet classes (Lab visit and Lab test) and their relationship (requires) to reflect their coordination.

In short: the figure visualizes two interacting proclet classes (Order system and Lab test) connected by two communication channels, showing the workflow from ordering to testing and reporting, plus a concrete example of the messages exchanged and a corresponding class-diagram view.
