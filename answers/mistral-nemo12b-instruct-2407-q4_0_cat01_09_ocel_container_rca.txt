Based on the provided directly follows graph and event log frequencies, here are some potential root causes for performance issues specific to this process:

1. **Inefficient Looping in Truck Process:**
   - The truck object has a significant looping pattern between "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck". This loop occurs 1989 times with an average duration of around 84,000 seconds (approximately 23 hours) per iteration. This could indicate inefficient routing or loading/unloading processes causing delays.

2. **High Frequency of Rescheduling:**
   - Both Vehicle and Transport Document objects have high frequencies of rescheduling events:
     - Vehicle: "Reschedule Container" -> "Book Vehicles" occurs 12 times with a duration of around 22,000 seconds (approximately 6 hours) per iteration.
     - Transport Document: "Order Empty Containers" -> "Reschedule Container" occurs 13 times with a duration of around 298,000 seconds (approximately 83 hours) per iteration. This high frequency and long duration could suggest issues with planning or coordination.

3. **Long Duration Events:**
   - Some events have very long durations, which could indicate performance issues:
     - "Load to Vehicle" -> "Depart" for Vehicle objects has a duration of around 73,000 seconds (approximately 20 hours) per iteration.
     - "Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart" for Transport Document objects has a duration of around 1,000,000 seconds (approximately 28 hours) per iteration.

4. **Inefficient Forklift Utilization:**
   - The Forklift object has a high frequency of looping between different events, such as "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle" -> "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock". This could indicate inefficient forklift utilization or poor process flow.

5. **Low Throughput in Some Processes:**
   - While some processes have high frequencies (e.g., "Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck" with 10,553 events), others have much lower frequencies, which might indicate bottlenecks:
     - "Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document" for Customer Order objects has only 594 events.
     - "Book Vehicles" -> "Order Empty Containers" for Transport Document objects also has a relatively low frequency of 593 events.

To improve performance, consider addressing these specific issues by optimizing routing, reducing rescheduling frequencies, minimizing long duration events, improving forklift utilization, and increasing throughput in low-frequency processes.
