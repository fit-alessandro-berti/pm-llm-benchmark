Based on the provided event log and standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) business practices, here is an analysis of the anomalies found in the cases.

To establish a baseline: **Case 1001 represents the "Happy Path" or ideal standard process.**
*   **Standard Sequence:** Requisition $\rightarrow$ Approval $\rightarrow$ PO Issuance $\rightarrow$ Goods Receipt $\rightarrow$ Invoice Receipt $\rightarrow$ 3-Way Match $\rightarrow$ Payment $\rightarrow$ Close.

Below are the anomalies identified in the remaining cases:

### Case 1002: "Maverick Buying" and "Blind Payment"
**Anomalies:**
1.  **PO Issued before Requisition Approval:** The Purchase Order was issued (Feb 1, 08:40) *before* the Purchase Requisition was approved (Feb 3, 08:00). In fact, the approval occurred *after* the payment was already released.
2.  **Payment before Verification (No 3-Way Match):** Payment was released (Feb 3, 07:15) before the Goods were received (Feb 4) and before the "Match Invoice to PO" step (Feb 5).

**Why this is problematic:**
*   **Unauthorized Spending (Maverick Buying):** Issuing a PO before approval bypasses internal controls. The company committed funds to a vendor without management authorization. The subsequent approval is merely a "rubber stamp" and provides no actual control.
*   **Financial Risk:** Paying the vendor before receiving the goods puts the company at significant risk. If the goods arrive damaged, incorrect, or never arrive at all, the company has already lost leverage because the cash has left the building.
*   **Compliance Failure:** Payment occurred before the "Match" activity. Most ERP systems require a match (PO + Invoice + Goods Receipt) to prevent overpayments or duplicate payments.

### Case 1003: "Unsubstantiated Pre-Payment"
**Anomalies:**
1.  **Payment before Invoice and Goods:** The payment was released on Feb 8, but the Invoice was not received until Feb 9, and Goods were not received until Feb 10.

**Why this is problematic:**
*   **Fraud Risk:** Making a payment without an invoice is a major red flag. Without an invoice, there is no document detailing what is being paid for, leading to high risks of fraud or embezzlement.
*   **Loss of Leverage:** Similar to Case 1002, paying before goods are received (and in this case, even before the invoice is seen) removes all incentive for the vendor to deliver on time or correct quality issues.
*   **Cash Flow Inefficiency:** Paying earlier than necessary negatively impacts working capital. Standard practice is to pay based on invoice terms (e.g., Net 30) *after* verification.
*   *Note:* While "Advance Payment" is a valid process in some specific industries, it usually requires a specific "Down Payment Request" activity. In a general P2P log, this sequence suggests a process violation.

### Case 1004: "Retroactive Purchase Order"
**Anomalies:**
1.  **Goods Received before PO Issuance:** The Goods were received on Feb 6 at 09:00, but the Purchase Order was not issued until 15 minutes later at 09:15.

**Why this is problematic:**
*   **Legal and Contractual Risk:** The Purchase Order represents the legal contract between the buyer and supplier. By accepting goods before the PO is issued, the company is accepting a delivery based on verbal agreements or informal emails rather than legally binding terms and conditions.
*   **Pricing Disputes:** Because the PO (which confirms price) was created after the goods arrived, the vendor may invoice at a higher rate than the company expects, leading to disputes.
*   **Process Bypass:** This usually happens when an employee orders something urgently over the phone and then rushes to create a PO in the system "after the fact" just to get the invoice paid. This hinders accurate budget tracking and inventory planning.
