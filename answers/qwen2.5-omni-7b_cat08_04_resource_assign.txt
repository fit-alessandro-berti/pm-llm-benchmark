### Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To analyze the performance and behavior of individual agents and support tiers (L1, L2, L3), we will leverage the event log data to extract meaningful insights about resource utilization, activity processing times, and first-call resolution rates. Here’s how we can proceed:

#### Metrics to Focus On:
1. **Workload Distribution**: Measure the number of tickets assigned to each agent and tier over time.
   - **Example Metric**: Average number of tickets per agent per day.
   
2. **Activity Processing Times**: Calculate the time taken for each stage of the ticket lifecycle (e.g., work start, work end, escalation).
   - **Example Metric**: Average time spent on each ticket type per agent.
   
3. **First-Call Resolution Rate (FCR)**: Track the percentage of tickets resolved at the first call by L1 agents.
   - **Example Metric**: FCR for each agent and tier.
   
4. **Skill Utilization**: Assess how frequently agents with specific skills are utilized for corresponding tickets.
   - **Example Metric**: Percentage of tickets requiring 'App-CRM' skills handled by agents with 'App-CRM' skills.

#### Process Mining Techniques:
1. **Resource Interaction Analysis**: This technique helps us visualize how resources interact during the process. We can map out the sequence of actions performed by agents and identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
   - **Example**: Identify if there are agents who frequently get stuck in queues or if certain agents are overwhelmed with high-priority tickets.

2. **Social Network Analysis Based on Handovers**: By analyzing the handover events, we can understand the relationships between agents and how often they collaborate or escalate tickets.
   - **Example**: Determine if there are agents who are frequently asked to escalate tickets or if there are agents who are not getting enough opportunities to escalate.

3. **Role Discovery**: This method identifies roles within the process and helps us understand which agents typically perform what tasks.
   - **Example**: Discover if there are agents who are primarily responsible for escalations or if there are agents who are consistently handling complex tickets.

#### Comparison to Intended Assignment Logic:
By comparing the actual assignment patterns with the intended assignment logic, we can identify discrepancies. For example, if an agent with 'App-CRM' skills is frequently assigned to 'Network' tickets, it indicates a mismatch in the skill-to-ticket assignment.

### Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Based on the analysis above, we can pinpoint several resource-related problems:

1. **Bottlenecks Caused by Insufficient Availability of Agents with Specific Required Skills**:
   - **Example**: If there are frequent reassignments because the correct skill set is unavailable, it indicates a bottleneck.
   - **Quantification**: Calculate the average delay caused per reassignment by measuring the difference between the expected and actual resolution times.

2. **Delays Introduced by Frequent or Unnecessary Ticket Reassignments or Escalations**:
   - **Example**: Identify cases where tickets are escalated unnecessarily or reassigned multiple times.
   - **Quantification**: Calculate the percentage of SLA breaches linked to skill mismatch by correlating the skill profile of the agent with the ticket requirements.

3. **Impact of Incorrect Initial Assignments by L1 or Dispatchers**:
   - **Example**: Analyze cases where L1 agents were initially assigned tickets that required more advanced skills.
   - **Quantification**: Measure the percentage of tickets that were escalated from L1 due to incorrect initial assignment.

4. **Identification of Underperforming or Overloaded Agents/Tiers**:
   - **Example**: Identify agents who consistently receive high-priority tickets but do not meet SLA targets.
   - **Quantification**: Use workload distribution metrics to determine which agents are consistently overloaded.

5. **Correlation Between Resource Assignment Patterns and SLA Breaches**:
   - **Example**: Correlate the frequency of reassignments with SLA breaches to identify if there is a direct relationship.
   - **Quantification**: Calculate the correlation coefficient between the number of reassignments and the percentage of SLA breaches.

### Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Potential root causes for the identified assignment problems include:

1. **Deficiencies in Current Assignment Rules**:
   - **Example**: Purely round-robin assignment without considering skills or workload.
   - **Solution**: Implement skill-based routing, potentially weighted by proficiency levels.

2. **Inaccurate or Incomplete Agent Skill Profiles**:
   - **Example**: Agents may not have up-to-date skill profiles, leading to incorrect initial assignments.
   - **Solution**: Develop a system to regularly update agent skill profiles based on performance and training.

3. **Poor Initial Ticket Categorization or Skill Requirement Identification**:
   - **Example**: Tickets may be categorized incorrectly, leading to inappropriate skill assignments.
   - **Solution**: Improve ticket categorization algorithms and provide training on accurate ticket classification.

4. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility into Agent Workload and Availability**:
   - **Example**: Agents may not know when other agents are available to take on additional tickets.
   - **Solution**: Implement real-time workload balancing tools that dynamically assign tickets based on availability.

5. **Insufficient Training or Empowerment of L1 Agents Leading to Excessive Escalations**:
   - **Example**: L1 agents may feel unempowered to resolve tickets independently.
   - **Solution**: Provide additional training and empower L1 agents to resolve tickets before escalating them.

### Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

Here are three concrete, data-driven strategies to improve resource assignment logic:

1. **Implement Skill-Based Routing**:
   - **Specific Issue Addressed**: Mismatch between ticket requirements and agent skills.
   - **How It Leverages Insights**: By analyzing the skill profiles of agents and the requirements of tickets, we can route tickets to the most suitable agents.
   - **Data Required**: Agent skill profiles, ticket categories, and required skills.
   - **Benefits**: Reduced need for reassignments, improved SLA compliance, and better utilization of agent skills.

2. **Develop a Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**:
   - **Specific Issue Addressed**: Uneven workload distribution among agents.
   - **How It Leverages Insights**: By analyzing real-time workload data, we can dynamically assign tickets to agents who are currently less busy.
   - **Data Required**: Agent workload data, ticket priority, and agent availability.
   - **Benefits**: Reduced resolution times, fewer reassignments, and improved SLA rate.

3. **Introduce Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Characteristics**:
   - **Specific Issue Addressed**: Inability to anticipate required skills and complexity.
   - **How It Leverages Insights**: By analyzing historical data on ticket resolution times and required skills, we can predict the appropriate agent for future tickets.
   - **Data Required**: Historical ticket data, agent skill profiles, and resolution times.
   - **Benefits**: Reduced need for reassignments, improved SLA compliance, and better utilization of agent skills.

### Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

#### Business Process Simulation:
Before implementing any changes, we can simulate the proposed strategies using process mining dashboards. This allows us to evaluate the potential impact of each strategy on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as resolution time, SLA compliance, and agent workload.

#### Plan for Monitoring Post-Implementation:
After implementation, we will monitor the effectiveness of the new resource assignment strategies using continuous process mining dashboards. Key resource-related KPIs and process views to track include:

1. **Resolution Time**: Average time taken to resolve tickets.
2. **SLA Compliance**: Percentage of tickets meeting SLA targets.
3. **Agent Workload**: Number of tickets assigned to each agent per day.
4. **Skill Utilization**: Percentage of tickets requiring specific skills handled by agents with those skills.
5. **Reassignment Frequency**: Number of times tickets are reassigned.

By continuously monitoring these KPIs, we can ensure that the new strategies are achieving their intended goals and make adjustments as necessary.
