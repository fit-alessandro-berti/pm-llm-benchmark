### BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

Based on the provided interview transcripts, I have synthesized the information into a structured textual description of the invoice approval process. This description captures the key activities, sequence flows, decision points, roles, artifacts, and exceptions as described by the stakeholders. The model is designed to be clear and logical, with ambiguities or variations noted where necessary. It can be used to create a visual BPMN diagram.

---

#### **Overview of the Process**
The invoice approval process begins when an invoice is received by the Accounts Payable (AP) team and ends when the invoice is scheduled for payment. The process involves multiple roles, decision points for validation and discrepancy handling, and exception paths for unresolved issues. The primary objective is to ensure that invoices are matched to valid purchase orders (POs), confirmed for receipt of goods/services, approved by the appropriate manager, and prepared for payment.

---

#### **Roles/Participants**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)**: Receives and logs invoices, performs initial checks, coordinates with other departments, and schedules payments (e.g., Mary).
- **Purchasing Officer**: Validates invoice details against the PO and confirms receipt of goods/services (e.g., Dan).
- **Department Manager**: Provides final approval for the invoice (e.g., Carlos).
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor**: Handles exceptions and escalated issues (e.g., Rita).
- **Supplier Relationship Manager**: Assists in resolving discrepancies with suppliers (e.g., Karen).
- **Systems**: Accounting system used for logging invoices, sending notifications, and tracking approvals.

---

#### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**
- **Invoice**: The primary document received from the supplier, which may or may not include a PO number.
- **Purchase Order (PO)**: Reference document used to validate the invoice details.
- **Confirmation Email**: Sent by Purchasing to confirm receipt of goods/services.
- **Approval Notification**: Automated system message sent to the Department Manager for final sign-off.
- **Revised Invoice**: Sent by the supplier if discrepancies or missing information (e.g., PO number) are identified.

#### **Process Flow Description**

1. **Start Event**: Invoice Received
   - **Description**: The process begins when an invoice is received by the Accounts Payable Clerk, typically via email.
   - **Role**: AP Clerk

2. **Task 1**: Check for Purchase Order (PO) Number
   - **Description**: The AP Clerk checks if the invoice contains a valid PO number.
   - **Role**: AP Clerk
   - **Gateway 1**: Does the invoice have a valid PO number?
     - **Yes**: Proceed to Task 2 (Log Invoice).
     - **No**: Proceed to Exception Path 1 (Request PO from Supplier).

3. **Exception Path 1**: Request PO from Supplier
   - **Description**: If the invoice lacks a PO number, the AP Clerk contacts the supplier to request the missing information. The Supplier Relationship Manager may assist if needed.
   - **Roles**: AP Clerk, Supplier Relationship Manager (if required)
   - **Output**: Revised invoice with PO number or clarification.
   - **Sequence**: Return to Task 1 (Check for PO Number) once information is received. If the supplier cannot provide a PO or the issue persists, escalate to Exception Path 3 (Escalate to AP Supervisor).

4. **Task 2**: Log Invoice into Accounting System
   - **Description**: The AP Clerk logs the invoice into the accounting system for tracking.
   - **Role**: AP Clerk
   - **Output**: Invoice record in the system.
   - **Sequence**: Proceed to Task 3.

5. **Task 3**: Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation
   - **Description**: The AP Clerk sends the invoice to the Purchasing Officer to confirm receipt of goods/services and validate details against the PO.
   - **Role**: AP Clerk (initiates), Purchasing Officer (receives)
   - **Sequence**: Proceed to Task 4.

6. **Task 4**: Validate Invoice Against PO
   - **Description**: The Purchasing Officer compares the invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) with the PO and confirms whether the goods/services were received.
   - **Role**: Purchasing Officer
   - **Gateway 2**: Do the invoice details match the PO and were goods/services received?
     - **Yes**: Proceed to Task 5 (Send Confirmation to AP).
     - **No**: Proceed to Exception Path 2 (Resolve Discrepancy).

7. **Exception Path 2**: Resolve Discrepancy
   - **Description**: If there are discrepancies (e.g., incorrect pricing, extra units, missing items), the Purchasing Officer or AP Clerk contacts the supplier for clarification or a revised invoice. The Supplier Relationship Manager may assist by referencing contracts or coordinating with the supplier.
   - **Roles**: Purchasing Officer, AP Clerk, Supplier Relationship Manager (if needed)
   - **Output**: Revised invoice or clarification from supplier.
   - **Gateway 3**: Is the discrepancy resolved?
       - **Yes**: Return to Task 4 (Validate Invoice Against PO).
       - **No**: Proceed to Exception Path 3 (Escalate to AP Supervisor).

8. **Task 5**: Send Confirmation to AP
   - **Description**: The Purchasing Officer sends a confirmation email to the AP Clerk indicating that the invoice matches the PO and goods/services were received.
   - **Role**: Purchasing Officer
   - **Output**: Confirmation email.
   - **Sequence**: Proceed to Task 6.

9. **Task 6**: Request Manager Approval
   - **Description**: The AP Clerk triggers an automated system notification to the Department Manager for final approval of the invoice.
   - **Role**: AP Clerk (initiates), System (sends notification), Department Manager (receives)
   - **Sequence**: Proceed to Task 7.

10. **Task 7**: Review and Approve Invoice
    - **Description**: The Department Manager reviews the invoice details, PO, and confirmation in the system. If everything is in order, they approve the invoice. If there are concerns (e.g., budget discrepancies, unexpected items), they may reject or request further investigation.
    - **Role**: Department Manager
    - **Gateway 4**: Is the invoice approved?
      - **Yes**: Proceed to Task 8 (Schedule Payment).
      - **No**: Proceed to Exception Path 4 (Reject or Investigate Further).

11. **Exception Path 4**: Reject or Investigate Further
    - **Description**: If the Department Manager rejects the invoice or identifies issues, they notify the AP Clerk to hold the invoice and investigate. This may involve coordination with Purchasing or the AP Supervisor.
    - **Roles**: Department Manager, AP Clerk, AP Supervisor (if escalated)
    - **Gateway 5**: Is the issue resolved?
      - **Yes**: Return to Task 7 (Review and Approve Invoice).
      - **No**: Process may loop or end with rejection (not specified in interviews).

12. **Task 8**: Schedule Payment
    - **Description**: The AP Clerk schedules the approved invoice for the next payment cycle in the accounting system.
    - **Role**: AP Clerk
    - **Sequence**: Proceed to End Event.

13. **End Event**: Invoice Scheduled for Payment
    - **Description**: The process concludes with the invoice being scheduled for payment.

#### **Exception Path 3**: Escalate to AP Supervisor
- **Description**: Used when discrepancies or missing information (e.g., no PO, unresolved pricing issues) cannot be resolved by the AP Clerk or Purchasing Officer. The AP Supervisor coordinates between departments, contacts suppliers, or works with department heads to create retrospective POs for informal contracts.
- **Roles**: AP Supervisor, potentially Department Heads or Supplier Relationship Manager
- **Output**: Resolution or directive (e.g., create retrospective PO, reject invoice).
- **Sequence**: Return to the appropriate step based on resolution (e.g., Task 1 for missing PO, Task 4 for discrepancies, or end process if rejected).

---

#### **Notes on Variations and Ambiguities**
- **Conflicting Accounts**: Most stakeholders agree on the general sequence (receive invoice  check PO  validate with Purchasing  manager approval  schedule payment). However, the exact handling of discrepancies varies slightly (e.g., whether Purchasing or AP Clerk contacts the supplier directly). I have modeled this as a shared responsibility with the Supplier Relationship Manager as a supporting role when needed.
- **Unresolved Rejections**: The interviews do not specify what happens if the Department Manager’s rejection or investigation cannot be resolved. I have noted this as a potential loop or process end.
- **Retrospective POs**: The AP Supervisor mentioned creating retrospective POs for informal contracts. This is modeled as part of the escalation path but lacks detail on how often this occurs or the specific steps involved.
- **Frequency of Exceptions**: Some exceptions (e.g., manager rejection) are rare (once every few months per Carlos), while others (e.g., missing PO) seem more common. Frequency is not explicitly modeled but noted for context.

#### **Summary**
This textual BPMN-like model captures the invoice approval process as described in the interviews. It includes the main sequence of tasks (from invoice receipt to payment scheduling), decision points (e.g., PO presence, invoice matching, manager approval), roles, artifacts, and exception paths (e.g., missing PO, discrepancies, escalations). The description is structured to allow for visualization in a BPMN diagram, with clear start and end events, tasks, gateways, and flows. Where ambiguities exist, they are documented to ensure transparency.
