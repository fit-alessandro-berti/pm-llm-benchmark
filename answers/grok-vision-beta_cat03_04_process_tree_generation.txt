Let's plan out a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process tree:

1. **Start**: The process begins with a purchase request.
2. **Approval**: The request must be approved by a manager.
3. **Order Placement**: If approved, an order is placed with the supplier.
4. **Goods Receipt**: Goods are received from the supplier.
5. **Invoice Receipt**: An invoice is received from the supplier.
6. **Verification**: There's a verification step where goods receipt and invoice are matched.
7. **Payment**: If verification passes, payment is made to the supplier.
8. **Loop for Discrepancies**: If there's a discrepancy in verification, there might be a loop back to recheck goods or invoice.

Now, let's translate this into a process tree using pm4py:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Creating the main structure
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Purchase Request
purchase_request = ProcessTree(label="Purchase Request", parent=root)
root.children.append(purchase_request)

# Approval
approval = ProcessTree(label="Approval", parent=root)
root.children.append(approval)

# Order Placement
order_placement = ProcessTree(label="Order Placement", parent=root)
root.children.append(order_placement)

# Create a sub-tree for goods receipt, invoice receipt, and verification
goods_invoice_verification = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
root.children.append(goods_invoice_verification)

# Goods Receipt
goods_receipt = ProcessTree(label="Goods Receipt", parent=goods_invoice_verification)
goods_invoice_verification.children.append(goods_receipt)

# Invoice Receipt
invoice_receipt = ProcessTree(label="Invoice Receipt", parent=goods_invoice_verification)
goods_invoice_verification.children.append(invoice_receipt)

# Verification
verification = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=goods_invoice_verification)
goods_invoice_verification.children.append(verification)

# Verification Successful
verification_success = ProcessTree(label="Verification Successful", parent=verification)
verification.children.append(verification_success)

# Loop for discrepancies
discrepancy_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=verification)
verification.children.append(discrepancy_loop)

# Loop Body: Recheck goods or invoice
recheck = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=discrepancy_loop)
discrepancy_loop.children.append(recheck)

# Recheck Goods
recheck_goods = ProcessTree(label="Recheck Goods", parent=recheck)
recheck.children.append(recheck_goods)

# Recheck Invoice
recheck_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Recheck Invoice", parent=recheck)
recheck.children.append(recheck_invoice)

# Payment
payment = ProcessTree(label="Payment", parent=root)
root.children.append(payment)

# Print or visualize the tree structure if needed
# You might need additional functions from pm4py to visualize or print the tree
```

This code constructs a process tree for a Purchase-to-Pay process, incorporating sequence, choice, and loop operators. Note that in actual implementation, you might need to handle edge cases or add more detailed steps. Also, visualization or further analysis tools from pm4py might be necessary to view or interact with this tree structure.
