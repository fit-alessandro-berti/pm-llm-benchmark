### 1. Identified Anomalies in Temporal Profile

**a) Receive to Approve (RP):**  
- **Average:** ~25 hours  
- **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (suspiciously low)  
- **Issue:** Approvals are happening with very consistent timing, which may indicate non-human-driven scheduling or batch processing.  

**b) Approve to Notify (PN):**  
- **Average:** 7 days  
- **Standard Deviation:** 2 days (very high)  
- **Issue:** There is significant variation; sometimes notification is prompt, sometimes delayed by over a week. Indicates possible bottlenecks or inconsistent process hand-offs.  

**c) Assign to Close (AC):**  
- **Average:** 2 hours  
- **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour  
- **Issue:** Claims are being closed quickly after assignment, potentially skipping required evaluations or approvals.  

**d) Evaluate to Notify (EN):**  
- **Average:** 5 minutes  
- **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute  
- **Issue:** Notification is happening almost immediately after evaluation, suggesting automated or possibly bypassed checks, which may not be plausible for real-world review or approvals.

### 2. Hypotheses for Each Anomaly

**a) RP (Consistent Approval Delay):**  
- Approvals might be scheduled by an automated batch process executed at fixed intervals.
- System-imposed wait periods or automated triggers causing uniform timing.
- Potential bypass of manual approval steps, or time is being set programmatically, not based on real work done.

**b) PN (Highly Variable Notification Delay):**  
- Manual notifications subject to adjuster availability, holidays, or backlogs.
- Notification is dependent on external systems or integrations that occasionally fail or queue up messages.
- Inconsistent staffing or process prioritization for communicating outcomes to customers.

**c) AC (Rapid Closure After Assignment):**  
- Certain claims may be automatically closed upon assignment (e.g., duplicates/fraud/simple errors).
- Process may skip evaluation and approval for specific claim types (e.g., very low-value or non-covered claims).
- Data entry mistakes, where events like Evaluate or Approve are not being recorded.

**d) EN (Instant Notification After Evaluation):**  
- Evaluation and notification are triggered by the same automated workflow step.
- Evaluation step is superficial or system-generated without human review.
- Approval might be missing/skipped in records; the workflow jumps from evaluation to notification without appropriate checks.

### 3. SQL Queries to Verify Hypotheses

#### a) Claims with Highly Consistent RP Timing  
```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END) AS receive_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS r_to_p_seconds
FROM
    claim_events e
    JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
GROUP BY
    c.claim_id
HAVING
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    abs(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END))) - 90000) < 3600 -- within 1hr of avg
;
```
**Review:** Claims where RP is almost always 25 hours ±1 hour.

---

#### b) Claims with Long PN Delays and High Variance  
```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS p_to_n_seconds
FROM
    claim_events e
    JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
GROUP BY
    c.claim_id
HAVING
    p_to_n_seconds IS NOT NULL
    AND (p_to_n_seconds > 604800 + 2*172800 OR p_to_n_seconds < 604800 - 2*172800)  -- outside 2 standard deviations
ORDER BY
    p_to_n_seconds DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
**Review:** Extremely delayed or unusually fast notifications after approval.

---

#### c) Closures Immediately Following Assignment  
```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END) AS assign_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS a_to_c_seconds,
    cr.claim_type
FROM
    claim_events e
    JOIN claims cr ON cr.claim_id = e.claim_id
    JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
GROUP BY
    c.claim_id, cr.claim_type
HAVING
    a_to_c_seconds < 7200   -- less than 2 hours
ORDER BY
    a_to_c_seconds
;
```
**Review:** Claims closed very shortly after assignment; check if particular claim types dominate.

---

#### d) EN Almost Immediate Notification  
```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN e.timestamp END) AS eval_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) AS notif_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN e.timestamp END))) AS e_to_n_seconds,
    cr.claim_type
FROM
    claim_events e
    JOIN claims cr ON cr.claim_id = e.claim_id
    JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
GROUP BY
    c.claim_id, cr.claim_type
HAVING
    e_to_n_seconds < 600   -- less than 10 minutes
ORDER BY
    e_to_n_seconds
;
```
**Review:** Rapid or instantaneous notification after evaluation; check if claim type is a factor.

---

#### e) Correlate Anomalous Timing with Adjusters or Regions  
```sql
SELECT
    a.adjuster_id,
    a.name,
    a.region,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id) AS claim_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END)))) AS avg_p_to_n_time
FROM
    claim_events e
    JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
    JOIN adjusters a ON e.resource = a.name  -- or another applicable join
GROUP BY
    a.adjuster_id, a.name, a.region
ORDER BY
    avg_p_to_n_time DESC
;
```
**Review:** Identify adjusters or regions where approval-to-notification is unusually delayed.

---

#### f) Check for Missing Intermediate Steps (AC without E or P)
```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END) AS assign_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END) AS close_time,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) AS eval_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN 1 END) AS approve_count
FROM
    claim_events e
    JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
GROUP BY
    c.claim_id
HAVING
    eval_count = 0 OR approve_count = 0
    AND assign_time IS NOT NULL
    AND close_time IS NOT NULL
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) < 7200
ORDER BY
    close_time - assign_time
;
```
**Review:** Claims closed after assignment without recorded evaluation or approval steps.

**Note:**  
For all queries, further filtering or group-by can be applied to segment by `claim_type`, `region`, or specific `resource`/`adjuster` as needed for root cause analysis.
