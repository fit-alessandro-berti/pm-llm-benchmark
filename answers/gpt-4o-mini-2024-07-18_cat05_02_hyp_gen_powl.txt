### Anomalies Identification

1. **Looping Structure**: 
   - The model creates a loop between the `Evaluate Claim (E)` and `Approve Claim (P)` activities. This could lead to multiple evaluations and approvals of the same claim before moving to the next stages, complicating the process.

2. **XOR Structure**:
   - The XOR structure allows for the skipping of the `Notify Customer (N)` step. This means a customer can potentially not be informed about the outcome of their claim, which is significant from a service quality perspective.

3. **Partial Ordering Anomalies**:
   - The absence of strict sequencing from `loop` to `C` (Close Claim) could allow claims to be closed without having undergone necessary evaluations or approvals, creating a risk of improper handling.
   - Additionally, the direct edge from `A` (Assign Adjuster) to `C` suggests that once an adjuster is assigned, a claim might be closed prematurely without following required evaluations or notifications.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

1. **Changes in Business Rules**:
   - The existing workflow may not have been updated to reflect changes in procedures, leading to an incomplete representation of the current claims process. The loop can indicate a temporary measure taken to accommodate backlogged claims, while the XOR might suggest uncertainty in how customer interactions could be managed during process bottlenecks.

2. **Miscommunication Between Departments**:
   - Different teams (e.g., claims processing and customer service) may not have aligned their workflows properly, leading to parts of the process being designed without full context. This could explain why customer notifications can be skipped entirely.

3. **Technical Errors in Workflow System**:
   - The modeling software may have limitations or bugs that permitted unlimited looping or improper path definitions, enabling sequences not designed to accommodate best practices.

4. **Inadequate Constraints in Process Model**:
   - The lack of strict enforcement in sequencing implies that appropriate constraints were not applied when modeling, revealing either a lack of understanding of the expected process or a failure to communicate those requirements.

### Verification Proposals Using Database

1. **Identify Claims Closed Without Proper Evaluation or Approval**:
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, COUNT(event_id) AS num_events
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'C' -- Closed Claim
   AND claim_id NOT IN (
       SELECT claim_id
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P')
   )
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING num_events > 0;
   ```
   - This query aims to find claims that were closed (activity 'C') without any corresponding evaluation ('E') or approval ('P') events, signaling a potential issue in the process.

2. **Locate Claims That Were Approved Multiple Times**:
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, COUNT(event_id) AS num_approvals
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'P' -- Approved Claim
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING num_approvals > 1;
   ```
   - This identifies claims that have multiple approval events which may indicate misuse of the looping structure where evaluations might be incorrectly counted as new approvals.

3. **Check Frequency of Skipped Customer Notification Steps**:
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, COUNT(event_id) AS num_notified
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'N' -- Notify Customer
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING num_notified = 0;
   ```
   - This will highlight how many claims either were closed or approved without notifying the customer, correlating directly back to the XOR condition.

4. **Evaluate Timing Between Key Events**: 
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id,
          MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS assigned,
          MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approved,
          MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS closed 
   FROM claim_events
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING approved IS NOT NULL AND closed IS NOT NULL
      AND approved > closed; -- Approvals that happen after closing
   ```
   - This query helps identify claims that were closed before they were actually approved, directly highlighting issues with partial order definitions. 

Implementing and analyzing the results from these queries would provide quantitative insights into the anomalies present in the claims handling processes.
