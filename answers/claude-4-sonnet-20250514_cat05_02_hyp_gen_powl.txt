## Analysis of Anomalies in the POWL Insurance Claims Model

### 1. Identified Anomalies

#### **Anomaly A: Evaluation-Approval Loop**
The model contains a `LOOP(E, P)` structure that allows repeated cycles of evaluation and approval for the same claim. This is unusual because:
- A claim should typically be evaluated once and either approved or denied
- Multiple approvals suggest indecision or lack of clear criteria
- This creates inefficiency and potential confusion about claim status

#### **Anomaly B: Optional Customer Notification**
The `XOR(N, skip)` structure allows the process to skip customer notification entirely. This is problematic because:
- Customer communication is typically mandatory for transparency
- Skipping notification could lead to customer dissatisfaction and legal issues
- It violates standard insurance industry practices

#### **Anomaly C: Premature Claim Closure**
The partial ordering allows `A  C` (direct path from assignment to closure), bypassing evaluation and approval:
- Claims can be closed without proper assessment
- This violates compliance requirements and risk management protocols
- Could lead to improper claim handling and financial losses

#### **Anomaly D: Weak Ordering Constraints**
The absence of strict sequential ordering between critical phases allows for:
- Activities to occur out of logical sequence
- Potential race conditions in automated systems
- Inconsistent process execution

### 2. Hypotheses for Anomaly Origins

#### **Hypothesis 1: Incomplete Business Rule Migration**
**Scenario**: The organization updated their claims handling procedures but only partially implemented the changes in the workflow system.
- **Root Cause**: IT department received incomplete requirements from business units
- **Evidence**: Legacy approval loops remained while new notification rules were only partially integrated

#### **Hypothesis 2: Exception Handling Overreach**
**Scenario**: The system was designed to handle exceptional cases but made these exceptions too broadly available.
- **Root Cause**: Overly permissive exception paths to handle complex claims
- **Evidence**: The optional notification was meant for specific claim types but became available for all claims

#### **Hypothesis 3: Multi-Department Miscommunication**
**Scenario**: Different departments (Claims, Customer Service, IT) had conflicting interpretations of the new process.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of unified process documentation and stakeholder alignment
- **Evidence**: Each department implemented their preferred workflow, leading to inconsistent model

#### **Hypothesis 4: System Integration Issues**
**Scenario**: Technical limitations during system integration forced workarounds that became permanent.
- **Root Cause**: Legacy system constraints or API limitations
- **Evidence**: Premature closure path was a temporary fix that wasn't removed

#### **Hypothesis 5: Inadequate Process Modeling Governance**
**Scenario**: The process model was created without proper validation and approval procedures.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of process modeling standards and review procedures
- **Evidence**: Model contains logically inconsistent paths that weren't caught in review

### 3. Database Verification Queries

#### **Query Set A: Detecting Evaluation-Approval Loops**

```sql
-- A1: Claims with multiple approval events
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    COUNT(ce.event_id) as approval_count
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'P'
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_amount
HAVING COUNT(ce.event_id) > 1
ORDER BY approval_count DESC;

-- A2: Claims with alternating evaluation-approval patterns
WITH event_sequence AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity,
        LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P')
)
SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
FROM event_sequence
WHERE (activity = 'E' AND prev_activity = 'P') 
   OR (activity = 'P' AND next_activity = 'E');
```

#### **Query Set B: Detecting Skipped Customer Notifications**

```sql
-- B1: Closed claims without notification events
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount
FROM claims c
WHERE c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT claim_id 
    FROM claim_events 
    WHERE activity = 'C'
)
AND c.claim_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT claim_id 
    FROM claim_events 
    WHERE activity = 'N'
);

-- B2: Notification skip rate by claim type
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_closed_claims,
    COUNT(n.claim_id) as notified_claims,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(n.claim_id) / COUNT(*), 2) as notification_rate
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events closed ON c.claim_id = closed.claim_id AND closed.activity = 'C'
LEFT JOIN claim_events n ON c.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY notification_rate ASC;
```

#### **Query Set C: Detecting Premature Claim Closures**

```sql
-- C1: Claims closed without evaluation
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.submission_date
FROM claims c
WHERE c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C'
)
AND c.claim_id NOT IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'E'
);

-- C2: Claims closed without approval
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.submission_date
FROM claims c
WHERE c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C'
)
AND c.claim_id NOT IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P'
);

-- C3: Claims with closure before evaluation (temporal anomaly)
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    close_time.timestamp as closure_time,
    eval_time.timestamp as evaluation_time
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events close_time ON c.claim_id = close_time.claim_id AND close_time.activity = 'C'
JOIN claim_events eval_time ON c.claim_id = eval_time.claim_id AND eval_time.activity = 'E'
WHERE close_time.timestamp < eval_time.timestamp;
```

#### **Query Set D: Process Flow Analysis**

```sql
-- D1: Complete activity sequences for anomalous claims
WITH claim_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) as total_events
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) as occurrence_count,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM claim_sequences
GROUP BY activity_sequence
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;

-- D2: Average time between key activities
SELECT 
    'Assignment to Evaluation' as transition,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e.timestamp - a.timestamp))/3600) as avg_hours
FROM claim_events a
JOIN claim_events e ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE a.activity = 'A' AND e.activity = 'E' AND e.timestamp > a.timestamp

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Evaluation to Approval' as transition,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - e.timestamp))/3600) as avg_hours
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events p ON e.claim_id = p.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND p.activity = 'P' AND p.timestamp > e.timestamp;
```

These queries will help verify whether the anomalies identified in the POWL model actually occur in practice and provide quantitative evidence to support or refute the proposed hypotheses about their origins.
