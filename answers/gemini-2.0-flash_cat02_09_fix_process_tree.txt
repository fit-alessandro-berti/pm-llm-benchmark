# Corrected Process Tree Model:
# Enforces the correct sequence for the Procure-to-Pay process.
# All activities are in a strict sequential order.
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,

# Explanation:

# 1. Issues with the original model:
#   - The original model used a PARALLEL block after Create_Purchase_Requisition and Approve_Purchase_Requisition.
#     This allowed Create_Purchase_Order, Receive_Goods, Receive_Invoice, Match_Invoice_to_PO, and Pay_Invoice to happen in any order.
#   - This is not realistic for Procure-to-Pay. For example, the invoice cannot be matched or paid before it is received or before the goods are received or the purchase order exists.

# 2. Corrected Model Explanation:
#   - The corrected model replaces the PARALLEL block with a SEQUENCE. This enforces that each activity must happen in the defined order.
#   - The sequence ensures that:
#     - A Purchase Order is created *after* the requisition is approved.
#     - Goods are received *after* the Purchase Order is created.
#     - An invoice is received *after* the goods are received.
#     - The invoice is matched *after* the invoice is received, the PO is created, and the goods are received.
#     - The invoice is paid *after* it has been matched to the Purchase Order and Goods Receipt.
#     - The case is closed *after* the invoice has been paid.

# 3. How the corrected model ensures conformance and prevents unwanted behavior:
#   - By using the SEQUENCE operator, the model explicitly defines the order of operations.
#   - This prevents illogical scenarios such as:
#     - Paying an invoice before receiving it.
#     - Matching an invoice before the goods are received.
#     - Receiving goods before a Purchase Order is created.
#     - Closing the case before the invoice is paid.
#   - The corrected model aligns with the standard Procure-to-Pay process flow and ensures that all steps are completed in the correct order.
