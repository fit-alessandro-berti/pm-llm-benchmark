Below is an example of how you can create a POWL model using pm4py for a hypothetical 'Purchase-to-Pay' process. In this example, we will create POOWL models that simulate these steps:
1.  "Request Order" : Send the order request to supplier.
2.  "Waiting for Payment" : Wait until received payment from customer
3.  "Accept Order". Accept the order.
4.  "Ship Goods" : Ship goods.

Here is an example implementation of how you can create a POWL model using pm4py.


```python
# Requires: pm4py object model as well as process tree operators.
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import OperatorPOWL, StrictPartialOrder
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Request Order
RequestOrder = Transition(label="Request Order")

# 2. Waiting for Payment
WaitingForPayment = SilentTransition()

# 3. Accepting Order is an exclusive choice between two models; it will depend on whether payment was received or not.
AcceptingOrder = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[WaitingForPayment, Transition(label="Accepted")])

# 4. If the accepting order is accepted (payment is paid), then shipping can proceed
ShipGoods = Transition(label="Ship Goods" )
accepted_ship_goods  = Transition(label=' ' + "Ship Goods")
 
# 5. Finally if payment was received (so acceptingOrder takes payment node) we end up with a purchase to pay
EndPoWlPurchasePayProcess = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RequestOrder, AcceptedShipGoods, WaitForPayment], order=[])

# Final Connection of POWL to the main process tree
EndPoWlPurchasePayProcess.order.add_edge(RequestOrder, AcceptingOrder)
EndPoWlPurchasePayProcess.order.add_edge(AcceptingOrder, accepted_ship_goods)
EndPoWlPurchasePayProcess.order.add_edge(accepted_ship_goods , EndPoWlPurchasePayProcess.nodes[0])
```

Here is a basic idea for how you can integrate these `POWL` in the form of Process Model  - we first will create process tree with these models.
