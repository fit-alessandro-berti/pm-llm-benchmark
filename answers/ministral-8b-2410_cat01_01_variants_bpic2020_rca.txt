Analyzing the provided process variants and their performance metrics (frequency and performance), we can identify several root causes for the performance issues. Here are the key considerations specific to the process and data:

1. **High Rejection Rates**:
   - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**:
     - Variants:
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (`frequency = 345, performance = 1604595.638`)
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (`frequency = 188, performance = 2061236.516`)
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 174, performance = 727139.517)
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (`frequency = 11, performance = 2544294.364`)
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 4, performance = 13805869.200)

     - **Root Cause**: High rejection rates at the ADMINISTRATION stage suggest that many declarations are not meeting initial criteria. This could be due to inadequate information, missing details, or policy non-compliance. To improve performance, review and potentially streamline the ADMINISTRATION's rejection criteria.

2. **Multiple Rejections and Redundant Workflows**:
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration REJECTED -> Declaration SUBMITTED**:
     - Multiple variants show repetitive cycles of submission and rejection, creating redundant work.
     - Examples:
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (`frequency = 77, performance = 1728631.623`)
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (`frequency = 4, performance = 3502608.250`)

     - **Root Cause**: Redundant workflows indicate inefficiencies in the process. Streamlining these cycles by providing clearer guidelines or automated checks can reduce delays and retries.

3. **Inefficient Approval Paths**:
   - **Declaration APPROVED by Multiple Roles**:
     - Variants:
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (`frequency = 10, performance = 2054847.800`)
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (`frequency = 40, performance = 1947246.400`)

     - **Root Cause**: Multiple approval steps can introduce delays, especially when roles like BUDGET OWNER or MISSING are involved. Review and optimize the approval paths to minimize unnecessary steps or bottlenecks.

4. **High Frequency of Certain Variants**:
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**:
     - Variants:
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (`frequency = 31, performance = 713794.452`)
       - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (`frequency = 22, performance = 1227602.318`)

     - **Root Cause**: High frequency indicates that many declarations are being rejected by SUPERVISOR and subsequently by EMPLOYEE. This suggests that SUPERVISOR’s rejection criteria or the overall process needs reevaluation to reduce unnecessary rejections.

5. **Variants with Zero Performance**:
   - **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE**:
     - Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 134, performance = 0.000)

     - **Root Cause**: A declaration saved by EMPLOYEE with zero performance indicates a step that is not contributing to the final performance. This step might be a placeholder or an intermediate state that does not add value to the process. Reviewing and potentially removing or optimizing this step could improve overall performance.

By addressing these specific process and data-related issues, you can work towards improving the overall efficiency and performance of the declaration process.
