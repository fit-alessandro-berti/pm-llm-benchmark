**Notes on Uncertainties and Conflicts:**
- **Sequence Flow After Escalation:**  
  - "After escalation to Rita, the process may return to either Purchasing Confirmation or Match Invoice Line Items, depending on the resolution path."

- **Alternative Paths:**  
  - "In some cases, after resolving discrepancies, the process may loop back to earlier steps such as Purchasing Confirmation or Matching Invoice Line Items."

**Visual Representation Guidance:**
- **Activities** should be represented as labeled rectangles with the performerâ€™s role indicated.
- **Gateways** should be diamond-shaped with condition labels (e.g., "PO Number Present?").
- **Sequence Flows** should be arrows connecting the elements in the order described.
- **Artifacts** should be linked to the respective activities they are associated with.
- **Exception Paths** should be clearly marked, possibly with different colored arrows or annotations indicating alternative flows.

This structured textual model captures the key components of the invoice approval process, including activities, decision points, roles, artifacts, and exceptions. It is designed to be easily translatable into a BPMN diagram for visualization and further analysis.
