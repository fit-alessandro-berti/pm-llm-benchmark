To identify and explain the deviations in the event log from the normative process, we'll analyze each case step by step:

1. **Case 1**
   - **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order
   - **Analysis**: The sequence follows the normative process without any deviations.
   - **Conclusion**: No violations.

2. **Case 2**
   - **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
   - **Analysis**: Packaging items occurs before the authorization of payment, which violates the normative rule that payment must be authorized before packaging.
   - **Violation**: "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment."

3. **Case 3**
   - **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order
   - **Analysis**: 
     - After canceling the order, the process should proceed directly to "Close order." Instead, it proceeds to "Ship order" which is not logical after a cancellation.
     - Shipping can only occur after packaging and should not occur after a cancellation.
   - **Violation 1**: "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
   - **Violation 2**: The use of "Ship order" after the order has been canceled is inconsistent with the normative process.

4. **Case 4**
   - **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order
   - **Analysis**: The sequence is consistent with the cancellation scenario outlined in the normative process. There are no invalid activities after cancellation and the sequence ends correctly with "Close order."
   - **Conclusion**: No violations.

5. **Case 5**
   - **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
   - **Analysis**: The normative process dictates that "Package items" should occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." This step is missing.
   - **Violation**: "Ship order" occurs without preceding "Package items."

**Summary of Violations:**

- **Case 2**: Packaging items before authorizing payment.
- **Case 3**: Shipping items after canceling the order.
- **Case 5**: Shipping items without a prior packaging step.

These violations suggest that Cases 2, 3, and 5 deviate from the normative process described.
