To model the temporal profile of a complex high-tech electronics supply chain, we must account for various timescales: from short-duration quality checks to long-duration international logistics and after-sales support. 

In the dictionary below, the values are represented as `(average_time_in_seconds, standard_deviation_in_seconds)`.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # --- Direct Successions ---
    # SS to OP: Decision making and administrative processing (approx. 2 days)
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 43200),
    
    # OP to RC: Procurement lead time, including manufacturing and transit (approx. 14 days)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 345600),
    
    # RC to QI: Time to move from dock to inspection station (approx. 15 hours)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (54000, 18000),
    
    # QI to CA: Moving cleared components to the assembly line (approx. 1.5 days)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (129600, 43200),
    
    # CA to PT: Complex assembly duration (approx. 4 days)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (345600, 86400),
    
    # PT to PK: Final functional testing and burn-in (approx. 8 hours)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (28800, 7200),
    
    # PK to WS: Packaging and transfer to internal warehouse (approx. 5 hours)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (18000, 7200),
    
    # WS to DT: Storage duration until logistics pickup (approx. 3 days)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 129600),
    
    # DT to AS: Time from shipment to the first support interaction (approx. 90 days)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (7776000, 2592000),

    # --- Indirect Successions (Multi-step transitions) ---
    # SS to RC: Total procurement window (approx. 16 days)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1382400, 350000),
    
    # OP to QI: From order placement to quality check (approx. 15 days)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (1296000, 350000),
    
    # RC to CA: Components arrival to start of assembly (approx. 2 days)

    # CA to PK: Manufacturing through to packaging (approx. 4.3 days)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (374400, 90000),

    ('PK', 'DT'): (277200, 130000),
    
    # WS to AS: Warehouse storage until the product is in the field and supported (approx. 93 days)
    ('WS', 'AS'): (8035200, 2650000),

    # --- Long Range Overviews ---

    ('SS', 'AS'): (10108800, 3000000)

### Key Considerations in this Model:
1.  **Lead Times:** The transition between Order Placement (`OP`) and Receiving Components (`RC`) has the highest variability and average time due to global shipping complexities.
2.  **Manufacturing Speed:** The Assembly (`CA`) and Testing (`PT`) phases are relatively stable but significant, reflecting a controlled factory environment.
3.  **Logistical Gaps:** Indirect pairs like `('SS', 'DT')` demonstrate the cumulative delay of the entire production pipeline.
4.  **After-Sales:** The transition to After-Sales Support (`AS`) uses a very large average and standard deviation, reflecting that customer issues can arise at any point over several months after the product is shipped.
