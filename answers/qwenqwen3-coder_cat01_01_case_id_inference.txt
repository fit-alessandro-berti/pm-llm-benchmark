To determine how the events can be grouped into separate cases, we analyze the data based on the following:

- **Patient Attributes**: `patient_age`, `patient_gender`
- **Sequence of Activities**: Logical flow of medical process (e.g., registration  triage  diagnosis  treatment  discharge)
- **Timestamps**: Events for the same patient should occur in a reasonable temporal order
- **Departments and Resources**: Consistent patient movement through departments

We look for unique combinations of patient demographics and follow the chronological and logical sequence of events to group them into individual patient journeys.
