Here is a BPMN-style, textual description of the “Invoice Approval” process, laying out lanes, tasks, gateways, sequence flows and exception/variation paths.  You can hand this to a modeller to recreate the diagram.

———

Process Name: Invoice Approval  
Lanes (Participants):  
 • AP Clerk (Mary)  
 • Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
 • Department Manager (Carlos)  
 • AP Supervisor (Rita)  
 • Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  
 • System

1. Start Event: “Invoice Arrives” (by email/mail)  
    Trigger: AP Clerk

2. Task [AP Clerk]: “Check for Purchase Order Number on Invoice”  
    Data Object: Invoice

3. Exclusive Gateway “PO Present?”  
   • Path A: No PO on Invoice  
   • Path B: PO present

— Path A1 (No PO, standard goods/services) —  
4A. Task [AP Clerk]: “Send Request to Supplier for PO”  
    Message  Supplier Relationship Manager / Supplier

5A. Task [Supplier Relationship Manager]: “Obtain and Provide PO to AP”  
    Message  AP Clerk

6A. Sequence Flow  back to step 2 (re-check for PO)

— Path A2 (No PO, informal/contracted services) —  
4B. Task [AP Clerk]: “Escalate to AP Supervisor”  
5B. Task [AP Supervisor]: “Evaluate invoice; decide:  
       • Create Retrospective PO  
       • OR Reject Invoice”  
6B. Exclusive Gateway “Retrospective PO Created?”  
     – Yes  flow back to step 2 (resume)  
     – No  End Event “Invoice Rejected”

— Path B (PO present) —  
7. Task [AP Clerk]: “Log Invoice in Accounting System”  
    System records Invoice+PO

8. Task [AP Clerk  System]: “Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation”

9. Task [Purchasing Officer]: “Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services”  
    Data Object: Goods/Services Receipt Confirmation

10. Task [AP Clerk & Purchasing Officer]: “Match Invoice Line Items against PO”  

11. Exclusive Gateway “Discrepancy Detected?”  
    • No  continue to step 12  
    • Yes  step 11A

11A. Task [AP Clerk (& Purchasing)]: “Clarify Discrepancy”  
      Could involve emails to Purchasing or Supplier  
      If involves contractprice check  Supplier Relationship Manager “Advise correct price per contract”

11B. Exclusive Gateway “Discrepancy Resolved?”  
     – Yes  return to step 9 (re-confirm)  
     – No  step 11C

11C. Task [AP Clerk]: “Escalate to AP Supervisor”  
11D. Task [AP Supervisor (& Karen/Dept Heads)]: “Resolve Exception”  
      Activities may include supplier calls, retrospective PO creation, inter-dept coordination  
      Output: corrected invoice or decision to reject

11E. Sequence Flow  back to step 9 (resume confirmation & match)

12. Task [System]: “Send Approval Request to Department Manager”  
     Automatic email with invoice, PO, confirmation, match result

13. Task [Department Manager]: “Review Invoice & PO; Approve or Reject”  

14. Exclusive Gateway “Manager Decision”  
    • Approve  step 15  
    • Reject/Hold  step 14A

14A. Task [Department Manager]: “Hold and Investigate”  
      Sends back to AP Clerk (or may escalate to AP Supervisor)  
      Sequence  step 11A (Clarify Discrepancy) or step 11C (Supervisor)

15. Task [AP Clerk]: “Schedule Invoice for Payment”  
      Added to next payment run in system

16. End Event: “Invoice Scheduled for Payment”

Notes on Ambiguities & Variations:  
• In some interviews, Purchasing Officer (Dan) implied he “approves” the match; in ours the final sign-off is by the department manager.  
• Mary (AP Clerk) always logs the invoice; Dan “checks details” but does not log. We model log  confirm  match as separate tasks.  
• Manager rejections (step 14A) happen infrequently (once every few months) but follow the same clarify/escalate loop.  
• Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) participates only on exceptions: missing PO, pricingcontract disputes.  
• The “informal services” exception (Path A2) arises when no formal PO exists; the AP Supervisor decides on retrospective PO vs. rejection.  
• After any exception is cleared, flow returns to receipt confirmation (step 9).  

This textual model defines tasks, roles, sequence flows, decision gateways, artifacts (invoices, PO, confirmations), and exception loops clearly enough to be rendered into a BPMN diagram.
