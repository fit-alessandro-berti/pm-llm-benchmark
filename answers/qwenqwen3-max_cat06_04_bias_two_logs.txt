The **Group B (Unprotected Group) log exhibits bias** — specifically, a **pro-local, pro-community-group bias** — that systematically advantages applicants who are *LocalResidents* and/or members of recognized *CommunityGroups*, even when their underlying financial merit (as captured by the PreliminaryScore) is lower than or equal to applicants in Group A.

---

###  How the Bias Manifests

#### 1. **Unequal Treatment via ScoreAdjustment**
- In **Group A (Protected)**, *no applicant* receives any score adjustment, regardless of circumstances. All adjustments are `0`.
- In **Group B (Unprotected)**, applicants who are **LocalResidents AND members of a CommunityGroup** (e.g., “Highland Civic Darts Club”) receive a **+10 “Community Boost”** to their score.
    - Example: **U001** (Prelim 720  730) and **U003** (Prelim 695  705) both received boosts.
    - **U002**, a LocalResident but *not* in a CommunityGroup, received **no boost** — showing the boost is conditional on *both* attributes.

 This creates a **two-tiered system**: identical preliminary scores (e.g., 720 for P001 and U001) result in different *effective* scores due to an arbitrary, non-financial adjustment.

#### 2. **Impact on Final Decisions**
Let’s compare cases with similar preliminary scores:

| Case | Group | Prelim Score | Final Score | Decision  | Notes |
|------|-------|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| P001 | A     | 720          | 720         | Approved  | No boost |
| U001 | B     | 720          | **730**     | Approved  | +10 boost  higher effective score |
| P002 | A     | 710          | 710         | Rejected  | — |
| U002 | B     | 710          | 710         | Rejected  | Same score, same outcome — but only because no boost applied |
| P003 | A     | 740          | 740         | Approved  | — |
| U003 | B     | **695**      | **705**     | **Approved** | Boosted from *below* P002’s 710 — yet still approved |

 **Critical finding**: **U003 (Group B)** had a *lower preliminary score (695)* than **P002 (Group A, 710)**, yet was **approved** due to the +10 boost, while P002 was **rejected**.

This is a **clear case of disparate impact**: applicants in Group B are being approved at lower financial risk thresholds than those in Group A, solely due to non-financial, demographic/community attributes.

###  Root Cause: Influence of `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup`

- These attributes are **only used in Group B** to trigger score adjustments.
- There is **no equivalent mechanism in Group A**, even if applicants might also be local or community-involved (but the data doesn’t capture it — or it’s deliberately ignored for “protected” applicants).
- The **“Community Boost”** is not applied uniformly — it’s **selectively enabled** for Group B, suggesting either:
    - A policy intentionally favoring Group B (e.g., to incentivize local civic engagement), or
    - A hidden proxy for demographic favoritism (e.g., privileging certain neighborhoods or social groups).

---

###  Systematic Differences & Fairness Implications

- **Group A applicants are evaluated strictly on financial metrics** — no contextual or social adjustments.
- **Group B applicants benefit from non-financial, socially-defined advantages** that can override objective risk assessments.
- This creates **systematic inequality**: two applicants with identical financial profiles may face different outcomes based solely on group membership and arbitrary social attributes.

 This is a textbook example of **algorithmic bias via feature engineering** — where seemingly “neutral” attributes (LocalResident, CommunityGroup) are used to create advantages for one group over another, without transparent justification or equal application.

---

###  Conclusion

> **Group B’s event log exhibits bias** by granting score adjustments based on LocalResident and CommunityGroup status — attributes irrelevant to creditworthiness — which systematically improves approval odds for Group B applicants, even when their underlying scores are lower than rejected Group A applicants.

This violates principles of **fairness through unawareness** (if Group A is protected, why are their community ties ignored?) and **consistency in decision thresholds**. It may also violate anti-discrimination norms if “LocalResident” or “CommunityGroup” membership correlates with protected attributes like race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

**Recommendation**: Either remove the “Community Boost” entirely, or apply it equally to both groups — and validate that such boosts don’t disproportionately benefit or harm protected classes.
