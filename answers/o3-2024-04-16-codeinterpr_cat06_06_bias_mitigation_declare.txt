Explanation of the added constraints and how they mitigate bias
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Existence of BiasMitigationCheck and ManualReview  
   • Guarantees that every case contains at least one explicit bias audit and one human double check, preventing “silent” automated decisions.

2. Co-existence (ManualReview  FinalDecision)  
   • Ensures that no FinalDecision (Approve/Reject) is issued without a ManualReview, and every ManualReview is meaningful (it leads to a decision).  
   • Provides symmetrical coverage: if either of the two events is present, the other must also appear somewhere in the trace.

3. Response after sensitive data access  
   • Whenever the process reads a sensitive attribute (age, gender, race) it is obliged to execute a BiasMitigationCheck at some later point, anchoring a formal fairness assessment in every such situation.  
   • The subsequent response BiasMitigationCheck  ManualReview forces a humanin-the-loop inspection of the mitigation outcome.

4. Succession from ManualReview to FinalDecision  
   • Prevents a “review-only” loop by requiring that a decision will eventually follow, keeping the process productive while preserving fairness.

5. Non-succession sensitive-attribute  FinalDecision  
   • Explicitly forbids an immediate jump from reading sensitive information to issuing the FinalDecision, blocking the typical pattern of snap judgements that create disparate impact.  
   • The process is compelled to insert at least one intervening activity (e.g., BiasMitigationCheck, ManualReview) between the two events.

Together these declarative rules embed mandatory bias checks and human oversight into the control-flow, substantially reducing the risk that sensitive attributes directly and unfairly influence the loan-approval outcome.
