### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**

**Case 2** violates the normative rules in two ways:
- **Ordering Violation:** The Risk Assessment was performed before the Credit Check. According to the normative constraints, the Credit Check must always occur before the Risk Assessment. This is a clear violation of the strict sequence.
- **Contradictory Action:** After the loan was rejected, the process included "Finalize Documentation," which is not allowed. The normative rules state that if the loan is rejected, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation.

**Reasoning:** These violations are serious because they break the strict sequence and logic of the process. The process is designed to ensure that decisions are made based on a proper evaluation of creditworthiness and risk, and skipping or reversing steps undermines this logic.

### **2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions**

**Case 3** fails to meet the desiderata conditions in two ways:
- **Timing of Credit Check:** The Credit Check was performed more than 24 hours after the application was received. While this is not a strict violation, it is suboptimal because the desiderata recommend completing the Credit Check within a short time window (e.g., 24 hours).
- **Timing of Informing Applicant:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision. Again, this is not a strict violation, but it is suboptimal because the desiderata recommend informing the applicant promptly (e.g., within 48 hours).
- **Missing Follow-up Call:** There was no Follow-up Call before closing the case. While this is not a strict requirement, it is a recommended best practice to ensure alignment with the applicant.

**Reasoning:** These deviations are not severe because they do not violate the strict normative rules. However, they represent suboptimal behavior because they delay the process and miss an opportunity to ensure alignment with the applicant. The desiderata are designed to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction, so failing to meet them is less than ideal.

### **3. Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors**

**Case 2:**
- **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check:** This could be due to a human error or a miscommunication in the process. For example, the team responsible for the Risk Assessment might have mistakenly started their work before the Credit Check was completed.
- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection:** This might be due to a lack of clear guidelines or training for the team handling the process. They might have assumed that documentation needs to be finalized regardless of the loan decision.

**Case 3:**
- **Delayed Credit Check:** The delay in performing the Credit Check could be due to resource constraints (e.g., a backlog of applications or limited staff availability). While this is not ideal, it might be understandable in a high-volume environment.
- **Delayed Informing Applicant:** The delay in informing the applicant could be due to internal processing delays or a lack of urgency in communicating the decision. This might indicate a need for better process management or automation to ensure timely communication.
- **Missing Follow-up Call:** The absence of a Follow-up Call might be due to oversight or a lack of emphasis on this step in the process. It could also be a result of resource constraints or prioritization of other tasks.

**General Justification:** While the normative rules are strict and must be followed, the desiderata are more flexible and can be influenced by external factors such as resource availability, workload, or operational challenges. In some cases, deviations from the desiderata might be unavoidable, but they should still be addressed to improve the overall efficiency and quality of the process.
