### Logic Behind Case Identification and Activity Naming:

- **Case ID**: A case is identified as a coherent session of user activities until they switch to a completely different application or context (e.g., switching from Microsoft Word to Google Chrome indicates the start of a new case). 

- **Activity Naming**: High-level, process-related activities are derived by grouping related actions under logical steps such as "Open Document," "Edit Document," "Draft Content," etc. This is done to abstract low-level activities like "FOCUS" and "TYPING" into higher-level tasks meaningful for process analysis.

### Summary:
The provided Windows system log was transformed into a structured event log suitable for process mining. The interpretation focused on identifying distinct user work sessions (cases) by tracking application switches, which allowed grouping events coherently around logical units of work. Raw low-level actions were abstracted into meaningful activities that describe high-level steps in the process—preparing and finalizing a report involving word processing, email correspondence, document review, budgeting adjustments, and summarization.
