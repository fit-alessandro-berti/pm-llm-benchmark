This visualization shows a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** depicting an order fulfillment workflow across four organizational lanes/swimlanes:

## 1. **Seller Lane (Top)**
- **Trigger**: Monthly morning schedule
- **Process flow**:
  - Check order for completeness
  - Verify if customer is already in database
  - If not, add customer to database
  - Check customer's order
  - Send order details
  - Receive product
  - Draft invoice
  - Process ends

## 2. **Production Lane**
- **Trigger**: Receives order details
- **Process flow**:
  - Plan production (with potential material not faulty loop)
  - Manufacture product
  - Mark product as complete
  - Sends completion signal forward

## 3. **Procurement Lane**
- **Subprocess**: "Material Compensation Subprocess"
  - Order materials
  - Return material option (shown with dotted line)
  - Check materials
  - Order cancellation option available
  - Connects to production planning

## 4. **Warehouse Lane (Bottom)**
- **Trigger**: Product complete signal
- **Process**: Send product
- **Output**: Product sent to customer

## Key BPMN Elements Present:
- **Events**: Start events (circles), intermediate events (double circles), end events (bold circles)
- **Activities**: Rounded rectangles (tasks)
- **Gateways**: Diamond shapes (decision points)
- **Message flows**: Dashed lines between lanes
- **Sequence flows**: Solid arrows within lanes
- **Data objects**: Database icon

The diagram illustrates cross-functional collaboration in order processing, from customer verification through production, procurement, and delivery.
