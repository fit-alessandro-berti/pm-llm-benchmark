### Anomalies Identification

Based on the temporal profile model, the following anomalies are identified:

- The **R to P** (Receive to Approve) average time is unusually low (25 hours) with a very low standard deviation.
- The **P to N** (Approve to Notify) average time is excessively long (7 days) with a high standard deviation.
- The **A to C** (Assign to Close) average time is relatively quick (2 hours) without intermediate steps.
- The **E to N** (Evaluate to Notify) average time is suspiciously short (5 minutes).

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

1. **Low STDEV in R to P**: Claims are being approved within a rigidly managed timeframe, possibly not aligning with actual processing times, indicating a system trying to force closure regardless of processing efficiency.
2. **Long P to N**: There might be a significant backlog in processing notifications after approvals or a lack of resources for timely notification, causing delays.
3. **Quick A to C**: Claims are being closed immediately after assignment, possibly indicating either a lack of thorough evaluation or the system skipping necessary steps.
4. **Short E to N**: This might indicate a skipping of evaluation or an immediate assignment of responsibility to a resource for notification without proper evaluation, suggesting a bypass of critical steps.

### Verification Queries

1. **Claims where R to P is Anomalous:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS receive_time, ce2.timestamp AS approve_time
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   WHERE ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp < (SELECT avg_time_in_seconds FROM temporal_profile WHERE (activity1, activity2) = ('R', 'P')) * 3600;
   ```

2. **Claims with Long P to N:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS approve_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'P'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp > (SELECT avg_time_in_seconds FROM temporal_profile WHERE (activity1, activity2) = ('P', 'N')) * 3600;
   ```

3. **Claims with Quick A to C:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS assign_time, ce2.timestamp AS close_time
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C'
   WHERE ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp < (SELECT avg_time_in_seconds FROM temporal_profile WHERE (activity1, activity2) = ('A', 'C')) * 3600;
   ```

4. **Claims with Short E to N:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'E'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp < (SELECT avg_time_in_seconds FROM temporal_profile WHERE (activity1, activity2) = ('E', 'N')) * 3600;
   ```
