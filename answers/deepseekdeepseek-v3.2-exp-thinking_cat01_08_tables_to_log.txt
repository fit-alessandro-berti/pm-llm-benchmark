We are going to create an event log with the following columns:
 - Case ID: order_id
 - Activity Name: We'll define activities for each step in the process.
 - Timestamp: The time when the activity occurred.
 - Resource/Actor: The person or system responsible for the activity.
 - Other Attributes: We can include additional details like item_id, quantity, delivery_id, invoice_id, payment_id, etc. as needed.

 Steps and events we can derive:

 1. Order Created: from Orders table (order_date)
    - Activity Name: "Order Created"
    - Resource: sales_person_id

 2. Item Picked: from Order Lines table (item_picking_date)
    - Activity Name: "Item Picked"
    - Resource: picker_id
    - Note: There can be multiple picking events per order (one per item or per line). We'll create one event per order line.

 3. Order Dispatched: from Delivery table (delivery_dispatch_date)
    - Activity Name: "Order Dispatched"
    - Resource: carrier_id (but note: carrier_id is a company, so we might not have a person. We can use the carrier_id as the resource, and if we want to map to a name, we can use the Resources table. However, the prompt says Resource/Actor is optional but recommended. We'll include the carrier_id and then if we want to show the carrier name, we can use the Resources table. But note: the Resources table has resource_id and resource_name. We can join on carrier_id to get the carrier's name. However, the event log should be at the event level, so we can either use the carrier_id or the carrier's name. Since the Resources table maps carrier_id to a company name, we can use that as the resource.

 4. Order Arrived: from Delivery table (delivery_arrival_date)
    - Activity Name: "Order Arrived"
    - Resource: carrier_id (same as above)

 5. Invoice Issued: from Invoice table (invoice_issue_date)
    - Activity Name: "Invoice Issued"
    - Resource: billing_person_id

 6. Payment Received: from Payments table (payment_date)
    - Activity Name: "Payment Received"
    - Resource: We don't have a direct resource for payment, but we can use the payment method or leave it blank? Alternatively, we can note that the payment was recorded by the system. Since the Payments table doesn't have a resource, we can omit the resource for payment events or set it to NULL.

 However, note that the prompt says: "If the tables contain information about which department or user performed the activity, include a 'Resource' or 'Actor' column." For payments, we don't have a resource, so we can leave it blank.

 But wait, the Payments table doesn't have a resource, but the Invoice table has a billing_person_id. However, the payment is a separate event and we don't know who recorded the payment. So we'll leave Resource blank for payment events.

 Alternatively, we can think of the payment as being done by the customer, but we don't have that information. So we'll leave it blank.

 Let's plan the events for each order:

 For each order, we have:
   - One "Order Created" event (from Orders)
   - One or more "Item Picked" events (from Order Lines)
   - One or more "Order Dispatched" events (from Delivery, one per delivery)
   - One or more "Order Arrived" events (from Delivery, one per delivery)
   - One or more "Invoice Issued" events (from Invoice)
   - One or more "Payment Received" events (from Payments, but note: payments are linked to invoices, which are linked to orders)

 We have to be careful: the same order can have multiple deliveries, multiple invoices, and multiple payments.

 We'll create one row per event and order them by timestamp.

 We'll also include additional attributes as needed. Since we are building a event log for process mining, we want to capture the sequence of activities for each case (order).

 Let's list the events for each order:

 Order 1001:
   - Order Created: 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z, Resource: SP-001
   - Item Picked for ITEM-001: 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z, Resource: WH-001
   - Item Picked for ITEM-002: 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z, Resource: WH-002
   - Order Dispatched: 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z (delivery_dispatch_date for DLV-5001), Resource: CR-01
   - Order Arrived: 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z (delivery_arrival_date for DLV-5001), Resource: CR-01
   - Invoice Issued: 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z, Resource: BL-001
   - Payment Received: 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z (for INV-1001), Resource: (blank)

 We note that the same order might have multiple deliveries (like order 1002) and multiple invoices (like order 1002) and multiple payments (like order 1002, but note: each payment is for a specific invoice).

 We'll generate the events in chronological order.

 We have to decide on the level of granularity for the events. For example, for picking, we have one event per order line. For delivery, we have one dispatch and one arrival per delivery. For invoice, one event per invoice. For payment, one event per payment.

 We'll use the following approach:

 1. From Orders: 
      Event: "Order Created"
      Timestamp: order_date
      Resource: sales_person_id

 2. From Order Lines:
      Event: "Item Picked"
      Timestamp: item_picking_date
      Resource: picker_id
      Additional attributes: item_id, quantity

 3. From Delivery:
      Event: "Order Dispatched"
      Timestamp: delivery_dispatch_date
      Resource: carrier_id
      Additional attributes: delivery_id, delivery_note

      Event: "Order Arrived"
      Timestamp: delivery_arrival_date
      Resource: carrier_id
      Additional attributes: delivery_id, delivery_note

 4. From Invoice:
      Event: "Invoice Issued"
      Timestamp: invoice_issue_date
      Resource: billing_person_id
      Additional attributes: invoice_id, invoice_amount

 5. From Payments:
      Event: "Payment Received"
      Timestamp: payment_date
      Resource: (blank)
      Additional attributes: payment_id, payment_method, payment_reference

 We'll combine all these events and sort by order_id and timestamp.

 We'll also consider that an order might not have all the events (for example, if it's not yet delivered or not yet paid). But in the given data, we have complete records for the provided orders.

 Let's create the event log:

 Steps:

 1. Create a list of events from each table.

 2. Union all these events.

 3. Sort by order_id (Case ID) and timestamp.

 4. We can also include the resource name from the Resources table if we want, but the prompt says the Resource/Actor is optional but recommended. We have the resource_id in the events, but we can map it to a name if we have the Resources table. However, the prompt says we can use the optional tables. Let's map the resource_id to the resource_name for the events that have a resource_id that exists in the Resources table.

 5. We'll leave the resource for payment events as NULL.

 However, note that the Resources table has resource_id and resource_name. We can do a left join on the resource_id to get the resource_name for events that have a resource_id. But note: the carrier_id is in the Resources table? Yes, because we have CR-01, CR-02, etc.

 But wait, the Resources table has:
   - Sales Person (SP-*)
   - Warehouse Staff (WH-*)
   - Carrier (CR-*)
   - Billing Clerk (BL-*)

 So we can map:

   - For "Order Created": sales_person_id -> resource_name
   - For "Item Picked": picker_id -> resource_name
   - For "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived": carrier_id -> resource_name
   - For "Invoice Issued": billing_person_id -> resource_name

 We'll create a mapping dictionary from the Resources table.

 Alternatively, we can do:

   SELECT resource_id, resource_name FROM Resources

 and then use that to map.

 Since we are generating a table in Markdown, we can do:

   Step 1: Extract events from Orders and map resource.
   Step 2: Extract events from Order Lines and map resource.
   Step 3: Extract events from Delivery and map resource.
   Step 4: Extract events from Invoice and map resource.
   Step 5: Extract events from Payments (no resource).

 Then, we combine and sort.

 Let's create the event log:

 We'll create a table with columns:
   Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, [Other Attributes]

 For Other Attributes, we can have a JSON string or multiple columns? Since we are outputting in Markdown, we can have fixed columns and then put additional attributes in a separate column as a string, or we can have columns for each attribute we want to include.

 However, the prompt says: "Other Attributes (if available): Any additional relevant data."

 We can include:

   - For Order Created: customer_id, customer_type, order_priority
   - For Item Picked: item_id, quantity
   - For Order Dispatched: delivery_id, delivery_note
   - For Order Arrived: delivery_id, delivery_note
   - For Invoice Issued: invoice_id, invoice_amount
   - For Payment Received: payment_id, payment_method, payment_reference

 But note: having too many columns might make the event log wide. Alternatively, we can have one column for "Additional Attributes" that contains a string with the key-value pairs.

 However, for process mining, it's common to have event attributes in separate columns. But we don't know the exact requirements. Let's include the most important ones as separate columns and then put the rest in a JSON-like string? Or we can have a fixed set of columns and then put the rest in an "attributes" column.

 Since the prompt doesn't specify, let's include:

   - Case ID: order_id
   - Activity Name
   - Timestamp
   - Resource (the resource_name from the Resources table, or the resource_id if not found? We'll use the resource_name if available, otherwise resource_id. But in our data, we have mapping for all.

 We'll also include:

   - For Order Created: customer_id, order_priority
   - For Item Picked: item_id, quantity
   - For Order Dispatched: delivery_id
   - For Order Arrived: delivery_id
   - For Invoice Issued: invoice_id, invoice_amount
   - For Payment Received: payment_id, payment_method

 We can leave out some details to keep the table concise, but the prompt says "if available". We can also note that we are including the delivery_note in the attributes for delivery events? Let's include it as an additional attribute.

 We'll create the following structure:

   Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp | Resource | item_id | quantity | delivery_id | invoice_id | invoice_amount | payment_id | payment_method | ... (other attributes)

 But this would be too wide and many columns would be NULL for events that don't have them.

 Alternatively, we can have:

   Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, and then a column for "Details" which is a string that contains the other attributes.

 But for process mining, it's better to have categorical attributes in separate columns. However, we don't know which ones are important. Let's follow the minimum and then include a "Details" column for the rest.

 The minimum is Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource.

 We can also include:

   - For Order Created: customer_type, order_priority
   - For Item Picked: item_id, quantity
   - For Delivery events: delivery_id, carrier_id (which is already in Resource, but we have the id and the name? We have the resource as the carrier name from the Resources table.

 Since we are going to output in Markdown, let's keep the table simple and include:

   Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, and then a column for "Additional Attributes" that is a string of key-value pairs.

 Alternatively, we can have:

   Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, [Other Attributes as separate columns]

 But the set of other attributes is not the same for every activity. So we can have:

   - For all events: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource
   - Then for each activity, we can have additional columns that are non-empty only for that activity.

 However, the prompt says: "One row per event" and "include, at a minimum, the following columns: ...". So we can add more columns.

 Let's decide on the following:

   - Case ID: order_id
   - Activity Name: as above
   - Timestamp: the timestamp of the event
   - Resource: the resource_name (from the Resources table) for events that have a resource_id, and for payments we leave blank.

   Additional columns:

   - item_id (for Item Picked)
   - quantity (for Item Picked)
   - delivery_id (for Order Dispatched and Order Arrived)
   - invoice_id (for Invoice Issued and Payment Received? Actually, Payment Received is linked to an invoice, so we can include invoice_id in Payment Received as well, but note: the Payments table has invoice_id, so we can include it.

   We can also include:

   - For Order Created: customer_id, customer_type, order_priority
   - For Item Picked: (already have item_id and quantity)
   - For Order Dispatched and Order Arrived: delivery_note (if we want) and carrier_id (but we already have resource for carrier name, but note: the resource we are using is the carrier name, so we don't have the carrier_id? We have the carrier_id in the Delivery table and we are using that to get the resource_name. So we can include the carrier_id as an additional attribute? But we don't have the carrier_id in the event log because we are using the resource_name. So if we want to keep the carrier_id, we can include it in the Additional Attributes.

 Since we are going to output in Markdown and the table might be wide, let's create a table with:

   Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, Additional Attributes

 In the Additional Attributes, we can put a string that contains the other information.

 Example for Order Created for order 1001:

   Additional Attributes: "customer_id: CUST-ABC, customer_type: Retail, order_priority: High"

 For Item Picked:

   Additional Attributes: "item_id: ITEM-001, quantity: 2"

 But note: we are already including item_id and quantity as separate columns? We decided to have them as separate? Let's change our mind and put everything except Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource in the Additional Attributes.

 So the structure:

   Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp | Resource | Additional Attributes

 We'll build the Additional Attributes as a string of key-value pairs, comma separated.

 Steps:

 1. Orders -> Event: Order Created
    - Case ID: order_id
    - Activity Name: "Order Created"
    - Timestamp: order_date
    - Resource: (from Resources table for sales_person_id)
    - Additional Attributes: 
        customer_id: <customer_id>, customer_type: <customer_type>, order_priority: <order_priority>

 2. Order Lines -> Event: Item Picked
    - Case ID: order_id
    - Activity Name: "Item Picked"
    - Timestamp: item_picking_date
    - Resource: (from Resources table for picker_id)
    - Additional Attributes: 
        item_id: <item_id>, quantity: <quantity>

 3. Delivery -> Event: Order Dispatched
    - Case ID: order_id
    - Activity Name: "Order Dispatched"
    - Timestamp: delivery_dispatch_date
    - Resource: (from Resources table for carrier_id)
    - Additional Attributes: 
        delivery_id: <delivery_id>, delivery_note: <delivery_note>

 4. Delivery -> Event: Order Arrived
    - Case ID: order_id
    - Activity Name: "Order Arrived"
    - Timestamp: delivery_arrival_date
    - Resource: (from Resources table for carrier_id)
    - Additional Attributes: 
        delivery_id: <delivery_id>, delivery_note: <delivery_note>

 5. Invoice -> Event: Invoice Issued
    - Case ID: order_id
    - Activity Name: "Invoice Issued"
    - Timestamp: invoice_issue_date
    - Resource: (from Resources table for billing_person_id)
    - Additional Attributes: 
        invoice_id: <invoice_id>, invoice_amount: <invoice_amount>

 6. Payments -> Event: Payment Received
    - Case ID: order_id (we get this via invoice_id -> order_id from Invoice table? But note: the Payments table has invoice_id, and the Invoice table has order_id. So we need to link Payments to order_id via Invoice.

    How to get order_id for a payment?
      - We have invoice_id in Payments, and we can get the order_id from the Invoice table.

    So we'll join Payments with Invoice to get the order_id.

    Then:
        Case ID: order_id (from Invoice)
        Activity Name: "Payment Received"
        Timestamp: payment_date
        Resource: (blank)
        Additional Attributes: 
            payment_id: <payment_id>, payment_method: <payment_method>, payment_reference: <payment_reference>, invoice_id: <invoice_id>

 But note: the Payments table doesn't have order_id, so we must join with Invoice.

 We'll do:

   SELECT p.*, i.order_id
   FROM Payments p
   JOIN Invoice i ON p.invoice_id = i.invoice_id

 Then we can get the order_id.

 Now, let's build the event log step by step.

 We'll use the following SQL-like steps (but we are doing it in code, so we'll use the given tables and then combine):

   Step 1: Map Resources to their names.

   We have a Resources table, so we can create a mapping:

   resource_mapping = {
        'SP-001': 'Alice Brown',
        ... 
   }

   We'll use this mapping to replace resource_id with resource_name.

   Alternatively, we can do:

      For each event that has a resource_id (like sales_person_id, picker_id, carrier_id, billing_person_id) we replace with the resource_name.

   Steps:

   Let's create a list of events.

   For Orders:
      for each row in Orders:
          event = {
            case_id: order_id,
            activity: 'Order Created',
            timestamp: order_date,
            resource: resource_mapping[sales_person_id],
            additional_attributes: f"customer_id: {customer_id}, customer_type: {customer_type}, order_priority: {order_priority}
          }

   For Order Lines:
      for each row in Order Lines:
          event = {
            case_id: order_id,
            activity: 'Item Picked',
            timestamp: item_picking_date,
            resource: resource_mapping[picker_id],
            additional_attributes: f"item_id: {item_id}, quantity: {quantity}"
          }

   For Delivery:
      for each row in Delivery:
          event_dispatch = {
            case_id: order_id,
            activity: 'Order Dispatched',
            timestamp: delivery_dispatch_date,
            resource: resource_mapping[carrier_id],
            additional_attributes: f"delivery_id: {delivery_id}, delivery_note: {delivery_note}"
          }
          event_arrival = {
            case_id: order_id,
            activity: 'Order Arrived',
            timestamp: delivery_arrival_date,
            resource: resource_mapping[carrier_id],
            additional_attributes: f"delivery_id: {delivery_id}, delivery_note: {delivery_note}"
          }

   For Invoice:
      for each row in Invoice:
          event = {
            case_id: order_id,
            activity: 'Invoice Issued',
            timestamp: invoice_issue_date,
            resource: resource_mapping[billing_person_id],
            additional_attributes: f"invoice_id: {invoice_id}, invoice_amount: {invoice_amount}"
          }

   For Payments:
      We need to join with Invoice to get order_id.
      for each row in Payments (after joining with Invoice on invoice_id to get order_id):
          event = {
            case_id: order_id,
            activity: 'Payment Received',
            timestamp: payment_date,
            resource: '',  # blank
            additional_attributes: f"payment_id: {payment_id}, payment_method: {payment_method}, payment_reference: {payment_reference}, invoice_id: {invoice_id}"
          }

   Then, we combine all events and sort by case_id and timestamp.

   We'll output the event log in Markdown.

 Let's code accordingly.

 However, note: the data is given in tables, so we are going to write the code in a way that we can run it on the given data.

 We'll assume we have the following data structures:

   orders = [ ... ]
   order_lines = [ ... ]
   delivery = [ ... ]
   invoice = [ ... ]
   payments = [ ... ]
   resources = [ ... ]

 We'll create a resource mapping dictionary from the resources list.

 Steps in code:

   resource_mapping = {}
   for resource in resources:
        resource_mapping[resource['resource_id']] = resource['resource_name']

 Then, we create events:

   events = []

   # 1. Orders
   for order in orders:
        events.append({
            'Case ID': order['order_id'],
            'Activity Name': 'Order Created',
            'Timestamp': order['order_date'],
            'Resource': resource_mapping.get(order['sales_person_id'], order['sales_person_id']),  # if not found, use the id
            'Additional Attributes': f"customer_id: {order['customer_id']}, customer_type: {order['customer_type']}, order_priority: {order['order_priority']}"
        })

   # 2. Order Lines
   for line in order_lines:
        events.append({
            'Case ID': line['order_id'],
            'Activity Name': 'Item Picked',
            'Timestamp': line['item_picking_date'],
            'Resource': resource_mapping.get(line['picker_id'], line['picker_id']),
            'Additional Attributes': f"item_id: {line['item_id']}, quantity: {line['quantity']}"
        })

   # 3. Delivery
   for deliv in delivery:
        events.append({
            'Case ID': deliv['order_id'],
            'Activity Name': 'Order Dispatched',
            'Timestamp': deliv['delivery_dispatch_date'],
            'Resource': resource_mapping.get(deliv['carrier_id'], deliv['carrier_id']),
            'Additional Attributes': f"delivery_id: {deliv['delivery_id']}, delivery_note: {deliv['delivery_note']}"
        })
        events.append({
            'Case ID': deliv['order_id'],
            'Activity Name': 'Order Arrived',
            'Timestamp': deliv['delivery_arrival_date'],
            'Resource': resource_mapping.get(deliv['carrier_id'], deliv['carrier_id']),
            'Additional Attributes': f"delivery_id: {deliv['delivery_id']}, delivery_note: {deliv['delivery_note']}"
        })

   # 4. Invoice
   for inv in invoice:
        events.append({
            'Case ID': inv['order_id'],
            'Activity Name': 'Invoice Issued',
            'Timestamp': inv['invoice_issue_date'],
            'Resource': resource_mapping.get(inv['billing_person_id'], inv['billing_person_id']),
            'Additional Attributes': f"invoice_id: {inv['invoice_id']}, invoice_amount: {inv['invoice_amount']}"
        })

   # 5. Payments
   # First, create a mapping from invoice_id to order_id from the Invoice table?
   invoice_order_mapping = {}
   for inv in invoice:
        invoice_order_mapping[inv['invoice_id']] = inv['order_id']

   for payment in payments:
        order_id = invoice_order_mapping.get(payment['invoice_id'])
        if order_id is None:
            # Skip if no matching invoice? But in our data, every payment has an invoice.
            continue
        events.append({
            'Case ID': order_id,
            'Activity Name': 'Payment Received',
            'Timestamp': payment['payment_date'],
            'Resource': '',  # blank
            'Additional Attributes': f"payment_id: {payment['payment_id']}, payment_method: {payment['payment_method']}, payment_reference: {payment['payment_reference']}, invoice_id: {payment['invoice_id']}"
        })

   Then, sort events by Case ID and Timestamp.

   Finally, output the events in a Markdown table.

 Let's code accordingly.

 However, note: the Payments table doesn't have order_id, so we must use the mapping.

 Let's write the code in Python-like pseudocode and then output the Markdown table.

 We are given the tables as Markdown, so we can convert them to lists of dictionaries.

 Let's assume we have the following variables:

   orders = [
        {'order_id': '1001', 'order_date': '2024-01-01T09:00:00Z', ...},
        ...
   ]

 We'll do:

   events = []

   # 1. Orders events
   for o in orders:
        events.append({
            'Case ID': o['order_id'],
            'Activity Name': 'Order Created',
            'Timestamp': o['order_date'],
            'Resource': resource_mapping.get(o['sales_person_id'], o['sales_person_id']),
            'Additional Attributes': f"customer_id: {o['customer_id']}, customer_type: {o['customer_type']}, order_priority: {o['order_priority']}"
        })

   # 2. Order Lines events
   for ol in order_lines:

   # 3. Delivery events (two per delivery)
   for d in delivery:
        events.append({
            'Case ID': d['order_id'],
            'Activity Name': 'Order Dispatched',

            'Additional Attributes': f"delivery_id: {d['delivery_id']}, delivery_note: {d['delivery_note']}"
        })

   # 4. Invoice events
   for i in invoice:
        events.append({
            'Case ID': i['order_id'],
            'Activity Name': 'Invoice Issued',
            'Timestamp': i['invoice_issue_date'],
            'Resource': resource_mapping.get(i['billing_person_id'], i['billing_person_id']),
            'Additional Attributes': f"invoice_id: {i['invoice_id']}, invoice_amount: {i['invoice_amount']}"
        })

   # 5. Payment events
   # First, create a mapping from invoice_id to order_id from the Invoice table.
   inv_to_order = {}
   for i in invoice:
        inv_to_order[i['invoice_id']] = i['order_id']

   for p in payments:
        order_id = inv_to_order.get(p['invoice_id'])
        if order_id is None:
            # Skip if no matching invoice? But in our data, every payment has an invoice.
            continue
        events.append({
            'Case ID': order_id,
            'Activity Name': 'Payment Received',
            'Timestamp': p['payment_date'],
            'Resource': '',
            'Additional Attributes': f"payment_id: {p['payment_id']}, payment_method: {p['payment_method']}, payment_reference: {p['payment_reference']}, invoice_id: {p['invoice_id']}"
        })

   Now, sort events:

   events_sorted = sorted(events, key=lambda x: (x['Case ID'], x['Timestamp']))

   Then, output in Markdown.

 Let's create the Markdown table:

   | Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp | Resource | Additional Attributes |
   |---------|---------------|-----------|----------|----------------------|

   Then for each event in events_sorted, output a row.

 Let's do it.

 Note: We are assuming that the given data is complete and we don't have missing resource mappings.

 Let's code accordingly.

 However, note: the Delivery table has two events per delivery: dispatch and arrival. We are creating two separate events.

 Let's generate the event log.

 We'll write the code in a way that we can run it on the provided data.

 We are given:

   orders = [
        {'order_id': '1001', 'order_date': '2024-01-01T09:00:00Z', 'customer_id': 'CUST-ABC', 'customer_type': 'Retail', 'sales_person_id': 'SP-001', 'order_priority': 'High'},
        ... 
   ]

 We'll create the resource_mapping from the Resources table.

 Resources table:

   resources = [
        {'resource_id': 'SP-001', 'resource_name': 'Alice Brown', 'role': 'Sales Person'},
        ...
   ]

 Let's code accordingly.

 We'll now generate the event log for the given data.

 Note: The data for order 1004 is present in Orders and Order Lines, but not in Delivery, Invoice, Payments? Let's check:

   Orders: 1004 exists.
   Order Lines: 1004 exists.
   Delivery: 1004 does not exist.
   Invoice: 1004 does not exist.
   Payments: 1004 does not exist.

 So for order 1004, we only have Order Created and Item Picked events.

 We'll include them.

 Let's code.</think>Based on the provided ERP tables, I'll create a comprehensive event log for process mining. Here's my approach:

**Assumptions Made:**
1. `order_id` is used as the Case ID for all process instances
2. Each order line picking is treated as a separate "Item Picked" event
3. Each delivery has both "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events
3. Payments are linked to orders through invoices
4. Resource names are mapped using the Resources table

**Event Log:**

| Case ID | Activity Name     | Timestamp               | Resource       | Additional Attributes                                      |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
