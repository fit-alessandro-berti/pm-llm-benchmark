If you look at the controlflow as you've modelled it, the only place where the score can move upward after the preliminary scoring is in that `xor_local_check` block. Applicants who happen to fall into whatever “local affiliation” you’ve defined go down a path where D is executed and, by your own comment, “leads to a subtle score uplift.” Applicants who don’t meet that criterion skip straight to the manual review, and don’t get the benefit of that uplift.

Two consequences of modelling it this way are:

- You’re introducing an explicit differential treatment on the basis of an attribute that isn’t part of the applicant’s creditworthiness per se. Over a population, people with the qualifying affiliation will have a systematically higher chance of clearing the manual review or ending up with better terms because their borderline cases are pushed over the line.

- Even if “local affiliation” isn’t a protected class in law, it may be correlated with protected characteristics (race, national origin, socioeconomic status, etc.), so the uplift can have knockon disparate impacts. It also raises fairness concerns in its own right: giving an incremental advantage to members of a favoured community group bakes in a form of preferential treatment that others cannot access.

From a fairness and equity perspective, it’s important to be transparent about this branching, to assess whether the uplift is justified by legitimate business needs, and to monitor outcomes to ensure it isn’t skewing the final decisions in ways you didn’t intend.
