**Redesigned Process with Optimizations for Reduced Turnaround Times and Increased Flexibility**

### **Overview of Changes:**

1. **Automation Integration**
2. **Predictive Analytics for Proactive Routing**
3. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**
4. **Streamlined Decision Making**
5. **Enhanced Feedback Loops**

### **Detailed Redesign with Proposed Changes:**

#### **Initial Phase (Unchanged in Sequence, Enhanced with Automation)**

1. **Start Event**
2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
   - **Change:** Automated Request Parser to immediately categorize and extract key request details.
   - **New Subtask A1:** "Predictive Analytics Engine" (runs in parallel)
     - Utilizes historical data and request characteristics to predict the likelihood of the request being non-standard/custom.
     - **Output:** "Customization Likelihood Score (CLS)"

#### **Enhanced Gateway and Parallel Processing for Standard Requests**

3. **Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type & CLS Analysis"**
   - **Conditioning Based on Request Type and CLS:**
     - **[Type = Standard & CLS < Threshold]:** Proceed to **Task B1** (as before, but with automated validation tools for speed).
     - **[Else]:** Proceed to **New Subprocess for Proactive Custom Handling**

#### **Standard Request Path Enhancements**

- **Task B1: "Automated Standard Validation"**
  - **Change:** Leverage AI for instant validation where possible.
- **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Automated Checks"**
  - **Tasks C1 & C2:** Utilize external APIs for rapid Credit and Inventory Checks.
- **Task D: "AI-Driven Delivery Date Calculation"**
  - **Change:** Incorporate real-time logistics data for more accurate estimates.

#### **New Subprocess for Proactive Custom Handling**

- ** ENTER NEW SUBPROCESS: "Proactive Custom Request Management" **
  - **Task B2.1: "Preliminary Custom Feasibility Check (Automated)"**
    - Quick, automated assessment based on the CLS and request details.
  - **Gateway (XOR): "Detailed Feasibility Required?"**
    - **[Yes]:** Proceed to **Task B2 (as before, but with prioritization based on CLS)**.
    - **[No, but CLS suggests potential for customization]:** Alert for optional precautionary measures in **Task E1** if approved.

#### **Unified Path Enhancements Post Initial Assessment**

- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?" (Enhanced with Automation Suggestions)**
  - **New Input:** Automated Approval Recommendation based on request value, customer history, and CLS.
  - **[If Yes]:**
    - **Task F: "Digital Approval Portal"** for streamlined manager approval with real-time updates.
    - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
      - **[If No]:** **Task H: "AI-Driven Re-evaluation with Recommendation Engine"**
        - Suggests adjustments for re-submission or automatically routes for custom quotation adjustments.
  - **[If No Approval Needed or Approved]:**
    - **Task G: "Automated Final Invoice Generation with Personalized Offer"**
      - Includes dynamic pricing based on customer value and request complexity.

#### **Final Phase**

- **Task I: "Automated Confirmation to Customer with Estimated Delivery and Personalized Message"**
  - **New:** Includes a satisfaction survey link for immediate feedback.
- **End Event**

### **Impact Analysis:**

| **Aspect** | **Expected Impact** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Turnaround Times** | **Reduced (avg. 30%)** | Automation, Parallel Processing, and Predictive Routing |
| **Flexibility for Non-Standard Requests** | **Increased** | Proactive Custom Handling Subprocess |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | **Improved** | Personalized Offers, Transparent Communication, Immediate Feedback Mechanism |
| **Operational Complexity** | **Initially Increased, Then Decreased with Adoption** | Initial setup of new technologies and processes, followed by streamlined operations |
