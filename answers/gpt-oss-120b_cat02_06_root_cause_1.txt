We need to answer tasks: identify cases with long total resolution times, determine root causes, explain factors, propose recommendations. Provide analysis, maybe compute durations. Use LaTeX for math. Provide tables. No code needed. Use proper formatting.

**1. Cases with unusually long total‑resolution times**

| Case ID | First event → Last event | Total resolution time |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 101 | 2024‑03‑01 08:00 → 2024‑03‑01 10:15 | 2 h 15 min |
| 102 | 2024‑03‑01 08:05 → 2024‑03‑02 09:15 | **1 d 1 h 10 min** |
| 103 | 2024‑03‑01 08:10 → 2024‑03‑01 09:30 | 1 h 20 min |
| 104 | 2024‑03‑01 08:20 → 2024‑03‑02 08:30 | **1 d 0 h 10 min** |
| 105 | 2024‑03‑01 08:25 → 2024‑03‑03 09:30 | **2 d 1 h 5 min** |

The “average” resolution time for the five tickets is  

\[
\bar{t}= \frac{2\text{h}15\text{m}+1\text{d}1\text{h}10\text{m}+1\text{h}20\text{m}+1\text{d}0\text{h}10\text{m}+2\text{d}1\text{h}5\text{m}{}}{5}
\approx 1\text{d} 2\text{h} \; .
\]

Cases **102**, **104**, and especially **105** are far above this average (by > 12 h, > 12 h, and > 30 h respectively).  
Thus, **102, 104 and 105** are the out‑liers that merit deeper investigation.

**2. Potential root causes**

| Case | Notable pattern(s) | Likely contributor(s) |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **102** | • 2 h 30 min between *Assign to Level‑1* (09:00) and *Escalate to Level‑2* (11:30).  <br>• 2 h 30 min between *Escalate* (14:00) and *Resolve* (next day 09:00). | **Escalation delay** – the ticket waited long before being escalated, and the Level‑2 team needed additional time to finish the investigation. |
| **104** | • 3 h 30 min between *Assign to Level‑1* (09:30) and *Investigate* (13:00).  <br>• 19 h 0 min between *Investigate* (13:00) and *Resolve* (next day 08:00). | **Long idle periods** before investigation and a **overnight hand‑off** (investigation stopped at 13:00, work resumed next morning). |
| **105** | • 1 h 0 min between *Assign* (09:00) and *Investigate* (09:10) – fine.  <br>• 1 h 0 min between *Investigate* (09:10) and *Escalate* (10:00).  <br>• 1 d 5 h 0 min between *Escalate* (14:00 next day) and *second Investigate* (14:00).  <br>• 19 h 0 min between *second Investigate* (14:00) and *Resolve* (next day 09:00). | **Multiple escalations** – the ticket was escalated, then left idle for a full day before the Level‑2 team resumed investigation.  <br>• **Hand‑off gaps** – after escalation, the ticket sat in a “waiting for specialist” queue for 24 h, inflating the cycle time. |

**Common themes**

| Theme | How it inflates cycle time |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Escalation latency** | The moment an issue is flagged for a higher‑level team, the ticket often remains in a queue for several hours or a full day before the specialist starts work. |
| **Idle time before investigation** | After assignment, tickets sometimes sit idle (e.g., 3 h 30 min in case 104) before the agent actually begins the investigation. |
| **Overnight hand‑offs** | When work stops in the late afternoon and resumes the next morning, the “waiting” period is counted as part of the ticket’s total duration. |
| **Repeated escalations** | Case 105 shows two escalation points; each creates a new waiting window, compounding the delay. |

**3. How these factors increase cycle times & Recommendations**

### 3.1 Mechanism of delay

| Factor | Process‑model impact |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Escalation latency** | In a typical process model, *Escalate → Investigate (Level‑2) → Resolve* is a sequential chain. If the transition *Escalate → Investigate* is delayed, the whole chain is stretched, turning a short‑lived “investigate” step into a multi‑day activity. |
| **Idle time before investigation** | The *Assign → Investigate* gap is a “waiting” activity that adds directly to the total lead time, even though no value‑adding work occurs. |
| **Overnight hand‑offs** | When the process is not 24 h‑continuous, any activity that ends in the evening automatically incurs a “forced wait” until the next shift starts. This is a systematic, predictable delay that can be quantified as *shift‑gap time*. |
| **Repeated escalations** | Each escalation introduces a new waiting queue. The cumulative effect is additive: \(\text{total time}= \sum_i (\text{waiting}_i + \text{processing}_i)\). More escalations → larger sum. |

### 3.2 Recommendations

| Recommendation | Expected effect |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Introduce a Service‑Level Agreement (SLA) for escalations** – e.g., “Escalated tickets must be assigned to a Level‑2 agent within 2 h.” | Reduces the *Escalate → Investigate* gap (observed 2 h 30 min → ≤ 2 h). |
| **Implement a “pull‑forward” policy for pending investigations** – agents should start the *Investigate* step within 30 min of assignment, unless a known blocker exists. | Cuts idle time (e.g., case 104’s 3 h 30 min gap). |
| **Adopt a 24‑hour “follow‑up” rule** – if a ticket is still open at shift end, a hand‑off note is sent and the next shift begins work within 1 h, not the next calendar day. | Eliminates systematic overnight waiting; reduces the 19 h gap seen in cases 104 and 105. |
| **Escalation triage board** – a small, dedicated team reviews escalations every hour and routes them immediately, preventing tickets from staying in the escalation queue for a full day. | Directly addresses the 24‑hour wait after escalation in case 105. |
| **Root‑cause analysis for repeated escalations** – capture why a ticket needed two escalations (e.g., missing information, ambiguous classification). Use this data to improve the initial triage rules, thereby reducing the number of escalations. | Fewer escalations → fewer waiting windows. |
| **Process mining dashboards** – visualise the *Assign → Investigate* and *Escalate → Investigate* intervals for each case in real time. Early detection of outliers triggers corrective actions (e.g., a reminder to the Level‑2 team). | Enables proactive management rather than post‑mortem analysis. |

### 3.3 Quick‑win impact estimate

Assuming the above SLAs are met:

| Case | Original total time | Target reduction | New total time (approx.) |
|------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 102 | 1 d 1 h 10 min | –2 h (Escalation SLA) –4 h (overnight hand‑off) | ~1 d 19 min |
| 104 | 1 d 0 h 10 min | –3 h 30 min (investigate start) –4 h (overnight) | ~20 h 40 min |
| 105 | 2 d 1 h 5 min | –2 h (first escalation SLA) –24 h (second escalation) –4 h (overnight) | ~1 d 19 h 5 min |

All three out‑liers would fall **within or close to the average** (≈ 1 d 2 h) after implementing the recommendations, indicating a substantial performance gain.

### **Take‑away**

- **Escalations** and **overnight hand‑offs** are the dominant sources of delay in the presented ticket‑resolution process.
- By tightening escalation response times, reducing idle periods before investigation, and ensuring continuous hand‑offs across shifts, the organization can bring the longest cases (102, 104, 105) down to the typical 1‑day resolution window.
- Deploying real‑time process‑monitoring (process‑mining dashboards) will help sustain these improvements and quickly surface any new bottlenecks.
