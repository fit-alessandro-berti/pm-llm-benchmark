<think>
Okay, I need to create two POWL models based on the given hiring process description. The first one should have potential unfairness, and the second one should eliminate that bias. Let me start by recalling the process steps and the key points where bias might occur.

From the description, the process has several stages: Resume Parsing, Skill Assessment, Cultural Fit Check with a possible XOR branch for Community Affiliation, and Managerial Review. The unfairness comes from the XOR branch where applicants with certain affiliations get a subtle advantage.

For the first model (with potential unfairness), I need to include an XOR choice after the Skill Assessment. One branch is the standard CulturalFitCheck, and the other is a CommunityAffiliationCheck that gives an advantage. The rest of the steps should follow normally.

For the second model (without unfairness), there should be no XOR branch. All applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck. The CommunityAffiliationCheck shouldn't exist here. The rest of the steps remain the same, ensuring fairness.

Let me list the activities as per the description:

- ReceiveApplication
- DataCompletenessCheck
- RequestMoreInfo (loop)
- SkillAssessment
- CulturalFitCheck
- CommunityAffiliationCheck (only in the first model)
- ManagerialReview
- FinalDecision

Now, structuring the first model (with unfairness):

1. Start with ReceiveApplication.
2. Then DataCompletenessCheck. If incomplete, loop back to RequestMoreInfo. This is a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo.
3. After data is complete, proceed to SkillAssessment.
4. After SkillAssessment, there's an XOR choice: either CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck.
5. Both branches then go to ManagerialReview.
6. Finally, FinalDecision.

Wait, but the CommunityAffiliationCheck is part of the XOR. So after SkillAssessment, the process splits into two paths. The CommunityAffiliationCheck would be a separate activity that gives a subtle advantage. Then both paths lead to ManagerialReview.

For the second model (without unfairness):

1. Same as above, but after SkillAssessment, there's no XOR. Instead, all go directly to CulturalFitCheck, then to ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

I need to make sure that in the first model, the XOR is between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. In the second model, the XOR is removed, and only CulturalFitCheck is present.

Now, translating this into POWL syntax. Let me recall the structure:

- Transitions with labels.
- OperatorPOWL for XOR and loops.
- StrictPartialOrder for partial orders.

For the first model (Potential Unfairness):

- The loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So a loop operator between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Wait, the loop is triggered if the data is incomplete. So the loop is a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop would be * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo). But in the example given, the loop is between A and B, where you do A, then B, then repeat. So maybe the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. But the actual process is: after DataCompletenessCheck, if incomplete, go to RequestMoreInfo, then back to DataCompletenessCheck. So the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop is * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo).

Then after that, SkillAssessment.

Then the XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. So X (CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck).

Then both of those branches go to ManagerialReview, and then to FinalDecision.

Wait, but in the model, the XOR would be a choice, and after that, both paths lead to ManagerialReview. So the structure would be:

After SkillAssessment, the XOR splits into two paths. Each path then leads to ManagerialReview. Then FinalDecision.

So the XOR is between two transitions: CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then both of those transitions are followed by ManagerialReview. Then FinalDecision.

But in POWL, how to represent that? The XOR would be the operator, and then after the XOR, the next steps. So the structure would be:

After SkillAssessment, the XOR node (XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck). Then, both of those activities are followed by ManagerialReview, which is then followed by FinalDecision.

But how to model that? The XOR node would have two children: CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, after the XOR, the next step is ManagerialReview. But in reality, both branches (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck) must lead to ManagerialReview. So the XOR is followed by a sequence of ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Wait, but in POWL, the nodes are arranged with partial orders. So after the XOR, both branches need to be followed by ManagerialReview. So the XOR is a choice, and after that, ManagerialReview is executed. So the structure would be:

After the XOR (which is the choice between the two paths), the next step is ManagerialReview, which is then followed by FinalDecision.

But how to model that in the POWL? The XOR node would be a child of the previous node (SkillAssessment). Then, the XOR node has two children: CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, after the XOR, there's a partial order where both paths lead to ManagerialReview. But since the XOR is a choice, once one of the branches is taken, the other is not. However, after the XOR, the next step is ManagerialReview, which is a single activity. So the structure would be:

SkillAssessment -> XOR (CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

But in POWL, the XOR is an operator, and the next steps are after that. So the XOR is a node, and then the next nodes are in a partial order.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

After SkillAssessment, there's an XOR node with two children: CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, after the XOR, there's a sequence of ManagerialReview followed by FinalDecision. So the XOR is followed by a sequence of ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

But how to represent that? The XOR is a node, and then the next node is ManagerialReview, which is part of a partial order.

Alternatively, the XOR node is followed by a partial order where both paths (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck) lead to ManagerialReview. But since XOR is a choice, once one path is taken, the other is not. However, in the model, after the XOR, regardless of which path is taken, the process goes to ManagerialReview.

So the structure would be:

SkillAssessment  XOR (CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

But in POWL, the XOR is an operator, and the next steps are after that. So the XOR node would be followed by a sequence of ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So the code would be:

A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
F = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E, F])

# The loop is between B and C, so the loop is * (B, C)
# Then after the loop, proceed to D (SkillAssessment)
# Then the XOR node, followed by G and H.

But how to structure the partial order? The overall structure would be:

- ReceiveApplication  DataCompletenessCheck (loop with RequestMoreInfo)  SkillAssessment  XOR (CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

So the StrictPartialOrder would have all these nodes, with the necessary orderings.

But the loop is between B and C, which is a loop. So the loop is a separate node. Then, after the loop, D (SkillAssessment) is next.

Wait, the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck (B) and RequestMoreInfo (C). So the loop is * (B, C). Then, after the loop, we proceed to D (SkillAssessment).

So the structure is:

ReceiveApplication  loop (B, C)  D  xor (E, F)  G  H.

But in POWL, the StrictPartialOrder would have all these nodes, with the orderings:

- A (ReceiveApplication) must come before the loop (B and C). But the loop is a separate node. Wait, no. The loop is a node that contains B and C. So the loop is a single node that has B and C as children in a loop. Then, after the loop, D is executed.

Wait, maybe the loop is a node that is a child of the StrictPartialOrder. So the overall structure is:

StrictPartialOrder with nodes: A (ReceiveApplication), loop (which is a loop between B and C), D, xor (E and F), G, H.

The orderings would be:

A  loop  D  xor  G  H.

But how to model that? The loop is a node, and the order is A  loop, loop  D, D  xor, xor  G, G  H.

So the code would be:

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])
xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E, F])

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, loop_node, D, xor_node, G, H])
root.order.add_edge(A, loop_node)
root.order.add_edge(loop_node, D)
root.order.add_edge(D, xor_node)
root.order.add_edge(xor_node, G)
root.order.add_edge(G, H)

But in the loop_node, the children are B and C, and the loop operator is between them. So the loop is a node that represents the loop between B and C. Then, after the loop, D is executed.

Similarly, the xor_node is between E and F. Then, after the xor, G and H are executed in sequence.

This should represent the first model with the XOR branch.

For the second model (without unfairness), the XOR is replaced by a single CulturalFitCheck. So after SkillAssessment, there's no XOR. Instead, it's a direct path to CulturalFitCheck, then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

So the nodes would be:

A (ReceiveApplication), loop_node (B and C), D (SkillAssessment), E (CulturalFitCheck), G (ManagerialReview), H (FinalDecision).

The orderings are similar, but without the XOR node. So:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, loop_node, D, E, G, H])
root.order.add_edge(A, loop_node)
root.order.add_edge(loop_node, D)
root.order.add_edge(D, E)
root.order.add_edge(E, G)
root.order.add_edge(G, H)

This way, all applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck, no XOR branch, thus eliminating the bias.

I need to make sure that in the first model, the XOR is present, and in the second model, it's not. Also, the CommunityAffiliationCheck is only in the first model.

Let me check the activities again. The first model includes CommunityAffiliationCheck, the second does not. The second model has CulturalFitCheck as the only option after SkillAssessment.

So the code for the first model would include the XOR with E and F, and the second model has only E.

I think this should work. Now, translating this into the actual POWL code with the correct classes and operators.

POWL (PARTIALLY ORDERED WORKFLOW LANGUAGE) MODELS

---

### **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
F = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop: DataCompletenessCheck  RequestMoreInfo (loop)
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])

# XOR: CulturalFitCheck vs. CommunityAffiliationCheck
xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E, F])

# Build the workflow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, loop_node, D, xor_node, G, H])
root.order.add_edge(A, loop_node)
root.order.add_edge(loop_node, D)
root.order.add_edge(D, xor_node)
root.order.add_edge(xor_node, G)
root.order.add_edge(G, H)
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Loop:** If `DataCompletenessCheck` fails, the process loops back to `RequestMoreInfo` until data is complete.  
- **XOR Choice:** After `SkillAssessment`, the process splits into two paths:  
  - `CulturalFitCheck` (standard evaluation).  
  - `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (gives subtle advantage to applicants with local ties).  
- **Bias Risk:** The `CommunityAffiliationCheck` introduces a subjective advantage, creating unfairness in the hiring process.

### **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop: DataCompletenessCheck  RequestMoreInfo (loop)
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])

# Build the workflow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, loop_node, D, E, G, H])
root.order.add_edge(A, loop_node)
root.order.add_edge(loop_node, D)
root.order.add_edge(D, E)
root.order.add_edge(E, G)
root.order.add_edge(G, H)
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Loop:** Same as above, ensuring data completeness.  
- **No XOR Branch:** All applicants undergo a **single, standardized** `CulturalFitCheck`.  
- **Fairness:** Eliminates the biased `CommunityAffiliationCheck` path, ensuring all candidates are evaluated equally.
