The diagram is a Sankey diagram that illustrates the flow of fines over time, from their imposition to their resolution. The overall structure consists of three main horizontal sections labeled 'Send Finc,' 'Insert Finc Notification,' and 'Send for Credit Collection,' which represent different stages in the process of handling fines. The vertical axis at the bottom represents time, spanning from January 25, 2000, to April 24, 2013. The flow lines, depicted in various shades of red and gray, connect these stages, indicating the progression of fines through the system. The red lines represent fines that were ultimately sent for credit collection, while the gray lines represent fines that were resolved without reaching the credit collection stage. The diagram visually conveys the temporal progression and resolution of fines, highlighting the pathways and transitions between different stages of fine management.
