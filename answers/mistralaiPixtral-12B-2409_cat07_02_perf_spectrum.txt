The diagram appears to be a Sankey diagram, which is used to visualize the flow of quantities between different stages. The overall structure consists of three main horizontal sections: "Send Finc" at the top, 'Insert Finc Notification' in the middle, and 'Send for Credit Collection' at the bottom. The lines, or flows, connect these sections, indicating the movement or transition of data or processes between them. The lines are color-coded, with red and gray lines representing different paths or types of transitions. The red lines likely indicate a specific subset of data or a particular process, while the gray lines represent other data or processes. The diagram spans a timeline from 2000 to 2013, suggesting that it tracks the flow of data or processes over time. The primary message of the diagram is to illustrate the pathways and transitions of data or processes within a system, highlighting the interactions and flows between different stages over a specified period.
