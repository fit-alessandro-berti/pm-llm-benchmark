**BPMNLike Textual Process Model**

```
Invoice Arrival (Event) --> Check PO Number (Check)
    |
   Yes -->
      Invoice Review: Verify quantities/ pricing against Purchase Order 
          -> Match confirmed? (Yes  Forward to Purchasing Dept.) 
          -> Discrepancy  Email Supplier / Accountant for clarification
    |     
   No  --> Reject Invoice (Reject) 
```

**Sequence Flow**

1. **Invoice Arrival**: The invoice is received, typically via email or system.
2. **Check PO Number**: Verification of a valid Purchase Order number; if absent, the process halts with rejection.
3. **Invoice Review**: Detailed verification against the purchased goods/services to ensure pricing and quantity match expectations.

**Decision Points (Gateways)**

- **PO Confirmation Gate**: The invoice must align in all critical details—quantities, prices, delivery charges—with the associated Purchase Order. If not matched:
  - Immediate rejection of invoice.
  - Escalation: Request for corrected PO from supplier or clarification request to AP clerk.

**Roles/Participants (Role Nodes)**

- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** 
  - Receives invoices via email/email system
  - Checks validity of purchase order number; forwards nonPO invoices back.
  - Logs and matches invoice data against Purchase Order in the accounting system.  
  - Sends matching status to Purchasing for confirmation.

- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**:
  - Confirms receipt of goods/services upon receiving invoice
  - Reviews PO details: quantity, price, delivery charges
  - Handles discrepancies by contacting suppliers or accounts payable clerk.
  - Ensures PO reference is present before proceeding; escalates missing information to AP Clerk.

- **Department Manager (Carlos):** 
  - Receives final approval notification from either Accounts Payable or Purchasing once all conditions are met.
  - Executes the payment schedule after manager’s approval if everything checks out.  
  - Handles special cases such as rejected invoices through direct oversight and resolution of irregularities by AP Clerk.

- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**:
  - Manages exceptions where verification fails or unresolved issues arise
  - Escalates to Purchasing when PO missing, data discrepancies occur; liaises between departments for rectification.
  
**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**

- **Invoices**: Originate as electronic documents and move through the process. 
- **Purchase Orders (POs)**: Required inputs during verification; outputs include confirmed match or rejection flags. 
- **Approval Notifications & Correspondences:** Systemgenerated emails requesting manager signoff, supplier confirmations for PO numbers/deliveries.

**Exceptions/Variations**

1. **Missing PO Numbers**: Leads to rejections (rejects) at step 2.
2. **Discrepancies in Quantities/Prices**: Escalate through AP Clerk  Supplier; may result in invoice rejection or correction request.
3. **InformedOnly Invoices** – If a service contract lacks a formal PO, the process loops to department head involvement for retrospective assignment.

**Uncertainty (Ambiguity)**

- The interview data allows no specific trace of exceptions where alternate paths diverge beyond explicit “reject” outcomes or manager approvals.
- For example: 
  - "Sometimes if discrepancies can’t be resolved easily I have to escalate it." – This suggests an exception that could vary, but details are not captured in the provided transcript.  

**Resulting BPMNLike Model**

The model captures core steps of invoice validation and approval as described by Mary, Dan, Carlos, Rita, and Karen with decision points at PO match confirmation and escalation triggers for discrepancies or missing information.
