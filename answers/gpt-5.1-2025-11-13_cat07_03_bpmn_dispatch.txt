The diagram is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) process map that shows how a computer hardware shop prepares and dispatches goods. It is organized in horizontal swimlanes representing roles/departments:

- **Logistics** (top lane)  
- **Dispatch of goods / Secretary** (middle lane)  
- **Warehouse** (bottom lane)

### Main flow

1. **Start event – “Ship goods”**  
   The dispatch process begins when goods need to be shipped.

2. **Clarify shipment method**  
   Using the **order details**, the secretary determines how the goods should be shipped.

3. **Decision: “Special handling?”**  
   - **No**  the process goes directly to *Check if insurance is required*.  
   - **Yes**  a subprocess starts to involve external logistics companies:
     - **Get 3 offers from logistic companies**  
     - **Select logistic company and place order**  
     - The chosen logistics company is then integrated back into the main flow.

4. **Check if insurance is required**  
   Customer information is consulted. A gateway labeled “If insurance necessary” decides:
   - If insurance is needed, go to **Insure parcel** in the Logistics lane, then back to the main flow.
   - In all cases the process continues to **Write package label** (gateway annotated “always”).

5. **Warehouse packaging**  
   In parallel with some of the above, the Warehouse:
   - **Package goods**  
   - If packaging takes longer than **48 hours**, a timer triggers **Notify customer about delay**.  
   - When packaging is finished, it joins back with the administrative flow at a parallel gateway.

6. **Consolidation**  
   Once:
   - the administrative activities (labeling, insurance, logistics selection) and  
   - the physical packaging  
   are both completed, the process continues.

7. **Fill out shipment paperwork**  
   All documents for shipment are prepared.

8. **Move package to pickup area**  

9. **End event – “Shipment prepared”**  
   The goods are now ready to be picked up and shipped.

Overall, the visualization describes the coordination between office staff, logistics decisions, and warehouse activities required to prepare a shipment, including handling of special logistics, insurance, and possible delays.
