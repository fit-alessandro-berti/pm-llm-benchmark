 Event abstraction is a technique used in process mining to simplify complex process models derived from event logs. The main idea behind event abstraction is to group similar events together and represent them as a single event, thereby reducing the complexity of the model while preserving the important behaviors observed in the event log.

Here are some ways to effectively utilize the concept of event abstraction to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models:

1. Identify similar events: The first step in event abstraction is to identify similar events that can be grouped together. This can be done based on various attributes of the events, such as their activity names, resource names, or time stamps. For example, all events related to a particular activity, such as "order processing," can be grouped together.
2. Define abstraction criteria: Once similar events have been identified, the next step is to define the criteria for abstraction. This involves deciding which attributes of the events to preserve and which to abstract away. For example, you might choose to abstract away the specific resource names associated with each event, but preserve the activity names and time stamps.
3. Create abstract events: Based on the abstraction criteria, you can then create abstract events that represent the groups of similar events. For example, an abstract event might be created for all "order processing" events that occurred within a certain time period.
4. Redraw the process model: Once the abstract events have been created, you can redraw the process model to reflect the abstraction. This might involve removing some of the detail from the model and focusing on the higher-level behaviors observed in the event log.
5. Validate the abstraction: It's important to validate the event abstraction to ensure that it accurately represents the behaviors observed in the event log. This can be done by comparing the abstract model to the original model and checking for any significant differences.

By using event abstraction to simplify complex process models, you can make them more readable and manageable, and easier to understand for stakeholders who may not be familiar with the underlying details of the process. Additionally, event abstraction can help to identify common patterns and trends in the event log, which can be used to improve the process or identify areas for further investigation.
