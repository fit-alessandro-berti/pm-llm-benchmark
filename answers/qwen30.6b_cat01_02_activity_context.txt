Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to understand the process in the event log. Each case starts with an Initiate Request, then various activities like Verify Documents, Call Customer, Submit Additional, etc. But some activities repeat, so I need to figure out their meaning and rename them accordingly.

Starting with C001. The first activity is Initiate Request. Then, when the agent checks documents, that's Verify Documents. But then there's a Call Customer with incomplete docs. Wait, so the initial process might be: customer submits, agent checks, then they call for more info. Then they submit the scan, which leads to another Verify. Then they submit something else, maybe adjust the account? Wait, in C001, the activity "Submit Additional" is mentioned, but the next activity after that is "Verify Documents again". So maybe the process is: submit the scan, then re-check documents. Then they proceed to adjust the account? Wait, in C001, there's an adjustment after the submit. So maybe the process is: submit scan, verify documents (re-check), then adjust account (submit additional?), then verify again. 

But in C001, the activity "Submit Additional" happens, but then the next activity is "Verify Documents again". So maybe "Submit Additional" is a step where they upload the scan, which leads to "Verify Documents" again. Then they adjust the account, leading to "Verify Documents" again. So perhaps the activity "Submit Additional" is renaming to something like "Upload Scan" to indicate uploading the scanned document. Then "Verify Documents" is reusing the same name but with context. But in C001, they have two instances of "Verify Documents": once after the scan submission and once after the adjustment. So maybe "Verify Documents" is renaming to "Double-Verify" to show that it's a two-step process. 

Similarly, for C002. The first activity is Initiate Request again, then Verify Documents, Call Customer, Adjust Account, etc. So maybe "Call Customer" can be renamed to "Follow-Up Call" to show that it's a step after the initial call. Then "Adjust Account" could be renamed to "Internal Correction" to indicate that it's an internal step. 

For C003, the process is walk-in, check ID, call customer, adjust account, re-verify, approve. So "Call Customer" could be renamed to "Check Customer" to show that it's a step for verification. "Adjust Account" is internal correction, so maybe "Internal Correction" again. 

Now, I need to make sure each renamed activity clearly reflects their context. For example, "Submit Additional" in C001 becomes "Upload Scan" to indicate uploading a document. "Verify Documents" in C001 becomes "Double-Verify" to show two steps. 

So, compiling all these, the revised log would have each activity renamed with their new context. Then, justifying each rename briefly. That should cover all the steps.

Here's the revised event log with renamed activities to better reflect their contextual roles:

**Revised Event Log:**

| Case ID | Activity          | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| C001    | Upload Scan      | 2024-05-01 10:10:00 | CustomerSelfServe| Customer uploads the requested ID scan (upload).              |
| C001    | Double-Verify     | 2024-05-01 10:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Re-check documents after upload (double verification).         |
| C001    | Follow-Up Call    | 2024-05-01 10:45:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Outbound call to confirm adjustments made.                |
| C001    | Internal Correction | 2024-05-01 11:25:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Adjust account details internally due to missing info.         |
| C001    | Re-Verify Docs    | 2024-05-01 11:50:00 | BranchOfficer   | Re-verify docs after account adjustment.                   |
| C001    | Final Approval    | 2024-05-01 12:30:00 | Supervisor     | Final approval given.                                      |

**Justification of New Names:**

1. **"Upload Scan"** reflects the act of uploading a scanned document.  
2. **"Double-Verify"** indicates a two-step process involving re-checking documents.  
3. **"Internal Correction"** highlights an internal correction step.  
4. **"Re-Verify Docs"** specifies that it involves re-verification of documents.  
5. **"Final Approval"** clearly states the final action taken.

These renamed activities disambiguate the process flow and highlight key steps in the workflow.
