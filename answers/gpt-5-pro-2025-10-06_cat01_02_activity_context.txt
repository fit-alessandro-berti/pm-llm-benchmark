Here’s how the meanings shift when an activity recurs, and how I’ve renamed them to reflect that context.

Activities that recur and how their meaning changes
- Verify Documents (C001, C003): 
  - First occurrence is the initial identity/doc check right after the request.
  - Second occurrence is a re-verification triggered by an update: in C001 after the customer submits missing docs; in C003 after an internal account adjustment.
- Call Customer (C002):
  - First call is to clarify a discrepancy before making changes.
  - Second call is a follow-up to confirm adjustments were applied.

Renaming logic used
- Verify Documents:
  - “Verify Documents - Initial Check” when it’s the first verification on the case.
  - “Verify Documents - Recheck After Customer Submission” when it follows “Submit Additional.”
  - “Verify Documents - Recheck After Internal Adjustment” when it follows “Adjust Account.”
- Call Customer:
  - “Call Customer - Request Missing Documents” when the purpose is to obtain docs.
  - “Call Customer - Clarify Account Discrepancy” when the purpose is clarification prior to adjustments.
  - “Call Customer - Confirm Adjustments” when confirming post-adjustment changes.
  - “Call Customer - Request Return to Branch” when asking a walk-in customer to come back.

Brief justification
- The triggers for re-naming are explicit in the Additional Context and sequence:
  - Phrases like “re-checks,” “after account adjustment,” and “follow-up” indicate a re-verification or confirmation step rather than an initial action.
  - Position in the sequence (before vs. after Submit Additional or Adjust Account) distinguishes initial checks from rechecks.
  - Call purposes (“clarify discrepancy,” “confirm adjustments,” “request missing docs,” “return to branch”) are stated in the context and drive the call-type labels.
