### **Detected Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model**  

1. **Receive to Approve (R ‚Üí P) shows an unusually low standard deviation**  
   - Average time: **25 hours** (~1.04 days)  
   - Standard deviation: **1 hour** (very low variability)  
   - **Why it's suspicious:** In real-world processes, the time from receiving a claim to approval should vary depending on claim complexity, adjuster workload, and external factors. A rigid, predictable pattern suggests automation, enforced deadlines, or artificial constraints.  

2. **Approve to Notify (P ‚Üí N) has an abnormally long average delay with high variability**  
   - Average time: **7 days**  
   - Standard deviation: **2 days**  
   - **Why it's suspicious:** A long and inconsistent delay between approval and customer notification might indicate a backlog, system inefficiency, or cases where notifications are manually triggered rather than automated.  

3. **Assign to Close (A ‚Üí C) is happening too fast**  
   - Average time: **2 hours**  
   - Standard deviation: **1 hour**  
   - **Why it's suspicious:** If a claim is being closed right after an adjuster is assigned, it suggests that some claims are being dismissed without proper evaluation or approval. This could indicate data entry issues, system errors, or an unusual workflow where some claims are resolved informally.  

4. **Evaluate to Notify (E ‚Üí N) happens too quickly**  
   - Average time: **5 minutes**  
   - Standard deviation: **1 minute**  
   - **Why it's suspicious:** If claims are evaluated and notifications are sent almost immediately, it may suggest a process where evaluations are not actually being performed, or notifications are being sent in an automated, preemptive manner.

### **Hypotheses on Possible Causes**  

1. **Systemic Automation or Rigid Scheduling**  
   - The low standard deviation in **Receive to Approve (R ‚Üí P)** suggests that approvals may be automated or follow a strict schedule that does not reflect real processing variability.  

2. **Manual Bottlenecks in Customer Notification**  
   - The high variability in **Approve to Notify (P ‚Üí N)** could indicate that notifications depend on manual intervention, possibly due to a backlog of approvals waiting for customer outreach.  

3. **Premature Claim Closures**  
   - The fast **Assign to Close (A ‚Üí C)** transition might mean certain claims are being marked as resolved without actually undergoing proper evaluation. This could happen due to:  
     - Duplicate claims being closed quickly.  
     - Fraud detection causing instant rejections.  
     - Certain adjusters bypassing evaluations under specific conditions.  

4. **Process Skipping or Automation Glitches**  
   - The near-instant **Evaluate to Notify (E ‚Üí N)** transition suggests that evaluations may be either:  
     - A formality with automatic pre-approvals.  
     - System glitches where notifications are sent before real assessments occur.

### **Verification Using SQL Queries**  

#### **1. Identify claims with unusually fast "Receive to Approve" (R ‚Üí P) times**  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, 
       MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'R') AS receive_time, 
       MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'P') AS approve_time, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'P') - 
                           MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'R'))) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'P') - 
                           MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'R'))) < 72000  -- Less than 20 hours
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds ASC;
```
üîç **Purpose:** Finds claims where approval is happening too quickly after receipt, indicating potential automated processing.  

---

#### **2. Check if long "Approve to Notify" (P ‚Üí N) delays correlate with specific adjusters or claim types**  
```sql
SELECT a.adjuster_id, a.name, c.claim_type, 
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))) AS avg_time_p_to_n_seconds
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON c.claim_id = a.adjuster_id
GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name, c.claim_type
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))) > 432000  -- More than 5 days
ORDER BY avg_time_p_to_n_seconds DESC;
```
üîç **Purpose:** Identifies whether certain adjusters or claim types are responsible for excessive notification delays.  

---

#### **3. Detect claims closed immediately after assignment (A ‚Üí C)**  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, a.timestamp AS assign_time, cl.timestamp AS close_time, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cl.timestamp - a.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events a
JOIN claim_events cl ON a.claim_id = cl.claim_id AND a.activity = 'A' AND cl.activity = 'C'
JOIN claims c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cl.timestamp - a.timestamp)) < 7200  -- Less than 2 hours
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds ASC;
```
üîç **Purpose:** Flags claims that are being closed immediately after assignment, possibly skipping evaluation.  

---

#### **4. Identify claims where "Evaluate to Notify" (E ‚Üí N) is happening suspiciously fast**  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, e.timestamp AS evaluate_time, n.timestamp AS notify_time, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 300  -- Less than 5 minutes
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds ASC;
```
üîç **Purpose:** Finds claims where notifications are sent almost immediately after evaluations, indicating possible skipping of steps.

### **Summary of Key Findings and Actions**  

| **Anomaly** | **Possible Cause** | **Verification Query** |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Rigid Approval Timing (R ‚Üí P)** | System automation, fixed schedules | Query 1: Check fast approvals |
| **Delays in Notification (P ‚Üí N)** | Manual backlog, resource constraints | Query 2: Correlate delays with adjusters/claim types |
| **Fast Claim Closures (A ‚Üí C)** | Premature resolution, fraud detection, duplicate claims | Query 3: Find claims closed immediately after assignment |
| **Instant Notifications (E ‚Üí N)** | Process skipping, automation glitch | Query 4: Detect near-instant evaluations |

By running these queries, we can pinpoint where the anomalies are occurring and investigate further to determine if they are system-driven, user-driven, or indicative of deeper process inefficiencies. üöÄ
