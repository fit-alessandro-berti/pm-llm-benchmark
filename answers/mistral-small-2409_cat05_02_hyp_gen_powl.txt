### Identifying the Anomalies

1. **Loop between Evaluation and Approval**:
   - The process model includes a loop where the claim is evaluated and then approved repeatedly. This is unusual because, typically, a claim should be evaluated once and then approved once.

2. **XOR that may Skip Customer Notification**:
   - The model has an XOR structure that allows skipping the customer notification step. This might be problematic if customer notification is a required step in the process.

3. **Premature Claim Closure**:
   - The model allows closing the claim (`C`) directly after assigning an adjuster (`A`), bypassing the evaluation, approval, and notification steps. This could lead to claims being closed without proper review.

### Generating Hypotheses on Why These Anomalies Exist

1. **Changes in Business Rules**:
   - The business rules might have changed recently, and the process model was only partially updated to reflect these changes, leading to anomalies.

2. **Miscommunication Between Departments**:
   - There might have been miscommunication between the claims department, adjusters, and the process modeling team, resulting in an incomplete or incorrect process design.

3. **Technical Errors**:
   - There could be technical errors or bugs in the workflow system that allow non-standard execution paths, leading to the observed anomalies.

4. **Inadequate Constraints in Process Modeler's Tool**:
   - The tool used to design the process model might have inadequate constraints or controls, allowing the creation of anomalous process flows.

### Verifying Hypotheses Using the Database

To verify these hypotheses, you can run the following database queries against the `claims`, `adjusters`, and `claim_events` tables.

#### 1. Identify Claims Closed Without Proper Evaluation or Approval

```sql
-- Find claims that were closed without an evaluation step
SELECT c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type, c.submission_date
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
WHERE e.claim_id IS NULL AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
);

-- Find claims that were closed without an approval step
SELECT c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type, c.submission_date
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'P'
WHERE e.claim_id IS NULL AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
);
```

#### 2. Locate Claims That Were Approved Multiple Times

```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id, COUNT(*) as approval_count
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity = 'P'
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

#### 3. Check if Customer Notification Steps Are Frequently Skipped

```sql
-- Check the proportion of claims that do not have a notification step
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_claims, COUNT(ce.claim_id) as notified_claims
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'N'
WHERE ce.claim_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Compare with total claims
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_claims
FROM claims;
```

By running these queries, you can identify real-world instances of the anomalies described in the process model and gather evidence to support or refute the hypotheses regarding the causes of these anomalies.
