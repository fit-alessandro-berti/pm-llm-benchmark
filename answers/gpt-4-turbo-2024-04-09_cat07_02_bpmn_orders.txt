The provided visualization is a complex process flow diagram that outlines various business operations within a company. This diagram is divided into three main sections: Sales, Production, and Warehouse. Here’s a breakdown of each section and the subprocesses involved:

### Sales
1. **Check customer’s order**
   - Starts on Monday morning when an order arrives.
   - The process involves checking if the customer is already in the database and if the order is complete.
   - If the customer is not in the database, they are added.
   - This stage ends with sending order details for further processing.

2. **Draft invoice**
   - Occurs towards the end of the sales process, where an invoice is prepared after the product is sent.

### Production
1. **Plan production**
   - Triggered by the arrival of order details.
   - It includes planning and then manufacturing the product.
   - A check occurs to ensure the material used is not faulty.

2. **Material Compensation Subprocesses**
   - Starts if materials need ordering or are checked for quality.
   - Defective materials may lead to order cancellation or material return.

### Warehouse
1. **Send product**
   - After the product is completed in production, it's ready to be sent from the warehouse.
   - This subprocess ensures the product is sent to the requisite destination.

Each section relies on successful completion of activities in the preceding section to continue operations without interruptions. The diagram uses standard symbols for process mapping like circles for starting/ending points, diamonds for decision points, and arrows showing the flow of the process. The diagram is well-structured with dashed lines indicating the transition of tasks between different sections, ensuring clarity in understanding the flow across different departments.
