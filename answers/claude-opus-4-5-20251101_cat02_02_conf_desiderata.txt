# Loan Application Process Analysis

## 1. Normative Rule Violations

### Case 2: **Two Serious Violations**

**Violation 1: Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check**
- At 08:20, Risk Assessment was conducted
- Credit Check didn't occur until 09:00 (40 minutes later)
- **Rule violated:** "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment"
- This is a clear sequencing violation that undermines the process logic—how can risk be properly assessed without first knowing the applicant's credit status?

**Violation 2: Finalize Documentation after Rejection**
- Loan Decision was "Rejected" at 09:30
- Finalize Documentation was performed at 10:00
- **Rule violated:** "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case"
- This is explicitly prohibited—there's no loan to document if the application was rejected.

### Cases 1 and 3: **No Normative Violations**
Both cases follow the required sequence correctly:
- Case 1: Perfect execution of the approved loan path
- Case 3: Correct sequence for an approved loan (despite timing delays)

## 2. Desiderata Violations (Suboptimal but Not Serious)

### Case 3: **Three Desiderata Deviations**

| Desideratum | Expected | Actual | Gap |
|-------------|----------|--------|-----|
| Credit Check timing | Within 24 hours of application | ~49 hours later | +25 hours |
| Inform Applicant timing | Within 48 hours of decision | ~75 hours later | +27 hours |
| Follow-up Call | Recommended before closing | Not performed | Missing |

**Assessment:** While Case 3 follows all mandatory rules correctly, it represents suboptimal service quality. The applicant experienced unnecessary delays and missed the courtesy follow-up.

### Cases 1 and 2: **Desiderata Compliance**
- **Case 1:** Exemplary—Credit Check within 30 minutes, applicant informed within 2 hours. No Follow-up Call recorded, but this is minor.
- **Case 2:** Despite normative violations, timing desiderata were actually met (Credit Check and notification occurred promptly). No Follow-up Call, but given the rejection and other issues, this is the least of concerns.

## 3. Possible Interpretations and Justifications

### Case 2 Interpretations:

| Violation | Possible Explanation | Validity |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| Risk Assessment before Credit Check | Perhaps a preliminary risk screening was mistakenly logged as full Risk Assessment, or there was a system error in timestamp recording | **Weak justification**—the rule exists to ensure informed decisions |
| Documentation after Rejection | Staff may have prepared documentation anticipating approval, or there's a misunderstanding about what "Finalize Documentation" means (perhaps it's rejection paperwork?) | **Weak justification**—if rejection paperwork is needed, it should be a different activity type |

### Case 3 Interpretations:

| Deviation | Possible Explanation | Validity |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| 49-hour Credit Check delay | Weekend/holiday intervened, third-party credit bureau delays, or complex applicant history requiring manual review | **Reasonable**—external dependencies may cause delays |
| 75-hour notification delay | Weekend intervened (Jan 14 decision  Jan 16 notification suggests possible weekend gap), or applicant was difficult to reach | **Reasonable**—communication delays are common |
| Missing Follow-up Call | Applicant confirmed everything via email/portal, or call was made but not logged | **Reasonable**—this is explicitly optional |

## Summary Table

| Case | Normative Compliance | Desiderata Compliance | Overall Assessment |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 |  Fully compliant |  Mostly compliant (no follow-up call) | **Exemplary** |
| 2 |  Two serious violations |  Timing met | **Non-compliant—requires review** |
| 3 |  Fully compliant |  Multiple timing delays, no follow-up | **Compliant but suboptimal** |
