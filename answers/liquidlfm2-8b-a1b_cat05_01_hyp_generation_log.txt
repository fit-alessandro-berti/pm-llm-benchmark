### Analysis and Identification of Anomalies/Desirable Patterns in Event Logs

The provided event logs for **order processing activities** reveal several key observations relevant to identifying undesirable or suspicious behaviors:

---

### 1. **Late Shipment Confirmation (Case 1001, Timestamp: 2024-02-01 09:45:00)**  
- Event: *Confirm Shipment* recorded **13 minutes late** relative to the first credit check on case 1001.  
- Resource: *LogisticsMgr_1* confirms shipment **09:45:00**, while the CreditCheck event was at 09:00:00.  
- Likely Explanation: Possible process delays due to resource unavailability, system bottlenecks, or escalation needed — but absence of early proactive notification.  
- **Anomaly Signal:** Preferable early confirmation triggers automatic alerts; late confirmation represents potential delay risk.

---

### 2. **Late Credit Check Confirmation (Case 1002, Timestamp: 2024-02-01 09:10:00)**  
- Credit check completed **37 minutes after order registration** (08:23 + 37 = 09:10).  
- Although within typical window (e.g., <1 hour), the pattern repeats across cases (1001, 1002, 1003), suggesting systemic delay.  
- **Anomaly Signal:** Consistent late credit initiations may indicate underwhelming compliance with credit policies or operational lag in risk review.

---

### 3. **Dubious Invoice Timing (Case 1003: Receive Payment = 2024-02-02 10:00:00)**  
- Invoice issued only **2 days after warehouse shipment confirmation** (09:45:00 Feb 1), but this is acceptable. However, the flow could benefit from stricter sequencing:  
- Issue Invoice follows credit check and shipment confirmation, aligning well.  
- **Anomaly Signal:** Payment receipt preceding full processing (e.g., stock validation complete, finances cleared) risks revenue recognition errors or fraud exposure if invoices issued prematurely.

---

### 4. **Early Shipment Attempt Failed (Case 1003, Timestamp: 2024-02-01 09:40:00)**  
- Shipment scheduled **on repeated early attempt** (`attempted_early=Y`), but confirmed only at 09:45.  
- Resource *LogisticsMgr_2* failed or refused early shipment, requiring manual intervention.  
- **Anomaly Signal:** Frequent retries flag timing issues or system delays — check workflow logic triggering early shipment permission.

---

### 5. **Lack of Resource Role Mapping in Events Beyond Logistics and Credit**  
- No `WarehouseClerk`, `FinanceTeam`, or `SalesRep` actions model logging clear role context tied to *resource_id* (e.g., tracking staff). This limits traceability of role-specific delays or errors.  
- **Hypothesis:** Missing structured role assignment in `order_event_log` hides efficiency bottlenecks per functional team.

---

### 6. **Discrepancy Between Order Value and Process Length**  
- High-value orders (e.g., case 1002, $2000.00; case 1004, $3000.00) follow similar late confirmations.  
- Long confirmation delays on premium orders risk revenue leakage if fraudulent activity masks late processing flags.  
- **Anomaly Signal:** Value thresholds should correlate with processing time controls — long high-value cases deserve prioritization.

## Recommended Investigative SQL Queries (to root cause anomalies)

These queries test hypotheses around timing delays, role context, and control thresholds.

---

**1. Identify Late Confirmations by Activity Type**

```sql
SELECT 
    event_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    resource,
    case_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND timeline->'CONFIRM_SHIPMENT' > INTERVAL '1 hour' THEN 'High Delay'
        WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND timeline->'PERFORM_CREDIT_CHECK' > INTERVAL '1 hour' THEN 'Late Credit Initialization'
        WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' AND timeline->'RECEIVE_PAYMENT' > timeline->'ORDER_PROCESSING_START' + INTERVAL '6 hours' THEN 'Postponed Payment Ref'
    END AS delay_hours,
    CASE 
        WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND timeline->'CONFIRM_SHIPMENT' <= timeline->'ORDER_PROCESSING_START' + INTERVAL '6 hours' THEN 'On-time'
        ELSE 'Delayed'
    END AS confirmation_status
FROM order_event_log
-- Define timeline wrapper (assume all events stored as single record; or join with event window)
WITH event_window AS (
    SELECT
      event_id,
      (
        event_id = order_events.event_id
      ) AS is_start,  -- naive check; replace with time window joins
      event_id,
      activity,
      timestamp,
      CASE 
          WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN 'ORDER_PROCESSING_START'
          WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 'PERFORM_CREDIT_CHECK'
          WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 'CONFIRM_SHIPMENT'
          WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN 'SHIP_GOODS'
          WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 'ISSUE_INVOICE'
          WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 'RECEIVE_PAYMENT'
          ELSE 'UNKNOWN'
      END AS activity_category
FROM order_event_log order_events
-- Join with event timeline using partitioning or self-join
JOIN order_event_log AS base
  ON base.event_id = order_events.event_id
WHERE 
  CASE 
    WHEN activity_category = 'Confirm Shipment' AND 
         base.timestamp > (
             base.event_window.ORDER_PROCESSING_START + INTERVAL '6 hours'
         ) THEN 'late_shipment'
    WHEN activity_category = 'Perform Credit Check' AND 
         base.timestamp > (
             base.event_window.ORDER_PROCESSING_START + INTERVAL '1 hour'
         ) THEN 'late_credit_check'
    WHEN activity_category = 'Receive Payment' AND 
         base.timestamp > (
             base.event_window.ORDER_PROCESSING_START + INTERVAL '6 hours'
         ) THEN 'late_payment'
  OR TRUE
ORDER BY timestamp;
```

---

**2. Count Late Events Per Team (Resource Role)**

```sql
SELECT 
  resource,
  role,
  COUNT(*) AS late_count,
 mysqli.fetchall() OR »;

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
  r.resource,
  r.role,
  COUNT(e.event_id) AS late_events
FROM order_event_log e
LEFT JOIN resources r ON e.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY r.resource_id ORDER BY timestamp) < e.timestamp
  AND (LAG(timestamp) - e.timestamp) > INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY r.resource_id, r.role
ORDER BY late_events DESC;
```

*(Note: PostgreSQL `LAG()` captures temporal gaps; use with caution on large datasets.)*

---

**3. Check Role-Field Association Across Events**

```sql
SELECT e.activity, r.role, e.timestamp
FROM order_event_log e
JOIN resources r ON e.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE e.activity NOT IN ('Register Order', 'Order Processing')
ORDER BY e.timestamp;
```

*Goal: Identify events lacking a clear `role` to spot untracked human inputs or system gaps.*

---

**4. High-Value Order Flow with Late Timing**

```sql
WITH high_value_orders AS (
  SELECT event_id, timestamp, case_id
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE order_value > 1000.00
  ORDER BY timestamp
)
SELECT
  h.event_id,
  h.timestamp,
  r.resource,
  r.role,
  ho.order_value,
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM h.timestamp, 'hee') AS hours_since_start
FROM high_value_orders h
JOIN resources r ON h.resource = r.resource_id
JOIN order_event_log e ON h.event_id = e.event_id
WHERE h.order_value > 1000.00
-- Estimate start via Register Order
SELECT abs(extract(epoch from e.timestamp) - extract(epoch from e REGISTER_ORDER.timestamp)) / (60*60) AS hours_since_start
FROM order_event_log e
ORDER BY hours_since_start DESC;
```

*verify if delays correlate with high revenue flows.*

### Conclusion

These queries target root causes of delays, policy non-compliance, and untracked role actions. They expose latency in credit, shipment, and invoicing — core risk points in order fulfillment. Improving timeline tracking via `event_window` window functions and enriching tables with explicit roles will strengthen anomaly detection and process authority visibility.

*Note: Adjust time window logic and join strategies based on actual schema (e.g., temporal partitioning, event clustering).*
