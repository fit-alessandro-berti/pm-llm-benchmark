# Activity Disambiguation Analysis

## Step 1: Identifying Recurring Activities and Contextual Shifts

| Activity | Case | Occurrences | Context Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Verify Documents` | C001 | 2× | First = initial check; Second = re-check after missing ID submitted |
| `Verify Documents` | C003 | 2× | First = initial physical check; Second = re-check after account adjustment |
| `Call Customer` | C002 | 2× | First = clarify a discrepancy; Second = confirm adjustments were made |
| `Call Customer` | C001, C003 | 1× each | Different purpose: C001 = request missing docs; C003 = ask customer to return |

---

## Step 2: Renaming Logic

### `Verify Documents`  Split into two distinct roles:

- **`Initial Document Verification`** — The first-pass check at the start of a case, before any issues are discovered or resolved.
- **`Document Re-Verification`** — A second check triggered by a prior resolution event (e.g., the customer submitted missing documents or an account correction was made). The context explicitly uses words like "re-checks" and "re-verify," confirming this is a reactive, follow-up verification.

### `Call Customer`  Split into purpose-specific names:

| Case | Original | Renamed | Contextual Clue |
|---|---|---|---|
| C001 | `Call Customer` | `Call Customer – Request Missing Documents` | "agent calls to request missing docs" |
| C002 (1st) | `Call Customer` | `Call Customer – Clarify Account Discrepancy` | "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy" |
| C002 (2nd) | `Call Customer` | `Call Customer – Confirm Adjustments` | "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made" |
| C003 | `Call Customer` | `Call Customer – Request Return to Branch` | "Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return" |

## Step 4: Justification of Naming Choices

### `Initial Document Verification`
> **Clues:** Always the *first* event after `Initiate Request`. The context describes a standard, unprompted check ("Agent checks identity documents," "Identity verification," "Physical verification of ID"). No prior action triggered this step — it is the default process gate.

### `Document Re-Verification`
> **Clues:** Always preceded by a corrective action (C001: customer submitted missing scan; C003: account was adjusted). The original context text explicitly uses re-verification language ("re-checks," "Re-verify"). Position in the flow (occurring after a mid-process intervention) and the reactive wording together confirm this is a second-pass, not a repeat of the initial check.

### `Call Customer – Request Missing Documents`
> **Clues (C001):** Positioned immediately after a failed initial verification. The context states the purpose directly: "agent calls to *request missing docs*." The call is a document-collection action, not a clarification or confirmation.

### `Call Customer – Clarify Account Discrepancy`
> **Clues (C002, 1st call):** Positioned before any internal adjustment. Context states "Outbound call to *clarify account discrepancy*" — the issue has been identified but not yet resolved. This is an investigative/diagnostic call.

### `Call Customer – Confirm Adjustments`
> **Clues (C002, 2nd call):** Positioned *after* `Adjust Account`. Context states "Follow-up call to *confirm adjustments made*." This is a verification/closure call, not an investigative one. Its position after the fix and the word "confirm" make the intent unambiguous.

### `Call Customer – Request Return to Branch`
> **Clues (C003):** Unique situational context: "Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them *return*." This is a physical-presence coordination call, meaningfully different from the document or adjustment calls in C001 and C002.
