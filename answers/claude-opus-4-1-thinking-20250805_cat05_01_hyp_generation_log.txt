## Analysis of Event Log Anomalies

After examining the provided event log data, I've identified several concerning anomalies and process violations that warrant investigation:

### Identified Anomalies

**Case 1002 - Premature Shipping:**
- Shipment was confirmed and goods were shipped BEFORE credit check and stock validation
- Credit check performed after goods already shipped (defeating its purpose)
- High risk of shipping to uncreditworthy customers

**Case 1003 - Missing Controls:**
- Stock validation step completely skipped
- Goods shipped before shipment confirmation
- Confirmation came after shipping (retroactive confirmation)
- Risk of shipping unavailable inventory

**Case 1004 - Payment Before Service:**
- Payment received before any verification steps
- Invoice issued AFTER payment received (reversed order)
- No credit check or stock validation performed
- Extremely unusual pattern suggesting potential fraud or system error

### Hypotheses for These Anomalies

1. **System Integration Issues**: Different systems may not be properly synchronized
2. **Manual Override/Bypass**: Staff circumventing controls for "priority" customers
3. **Training Deficiencies**: New staff not following proper procedures
4. **Time Pressure**: Rush orders leading to shortcuts
5. **Fraud Risk**: Unusual payment patterns could indicate money laundering or fraudulent activities
6. **System Gaming**: Staff manipulating process to meet KPIs

### SQL Queries for Investigation

```sql
-- 1. Identify all cases with out-of-sequence activities
WITH expected_sequence AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as actual_seq,
        CASE activity
            WHEN 'Register Order' THEN 1
            WHEN 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
            WHEN 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
            WHEN 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
            WHEN 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
            WHEN 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
            WHEN 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
        END as expected_seq
    FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity || ' (Expected: ' || expected_seq || ', Actual: ' || actual_seq || ')', ' -> ' 
               ORDER BY timestamp) as process_flow,
    COUNT(*) as total_activities
FROM expected_sequence
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING MAX(expected_seq) < MAX(actual_seq) 
    OR MIN(expected_seq) > MIN(actual_seq);

-- 2. Find cases where shipping occurs before critical checks
SELECT 
    oel.case_id,
    o.order_value,
    o.order_type,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) as ship_time,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) as credit_check_time,

    MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) < 
        COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END), '2099-12-31'::timestamp)
    OR
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) < 
        COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END), '2099-12-31'::timestamp);

-- 3. Identify missing mandatory activities by case
WITH mandatory_activities AS (
    SELECT unnest(ARRAY['Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 
                        'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment']) as activity

CROSS JOIN mandatory_activities ma
LEFT JOIN case_activities ca ON c.case_id = ca.case_id AND ma.activity = ca.activity
JOIN orders o ON c.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE ca.activity IS NULL
GROUP BY c.case_id, o.order_value
ORDER BY missing_count DESC, o.order_value DESC;

-- 4. Detect payment before invoice anomalies
SELECT 
    oel1.case_id,
    o.order_value,
    oel1.timestamp as payment_time,
    oel2.timestamp as invoice_time,
    oel1.resource as payment_receiver,

FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
JOIN orders o ON oel1.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
    AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
    AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;

-- 5. Analyze resource behavior patterns for potential fraud or training issues
SELECT 
    r.resource_id,
    r.role,
    r.department,
    COUNT(DISTINCT oel.case_id) as cases_handled,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
        WHEN oel.activity NOT IN (
            SELECT activity 
            FROM order_event_log oel2 
            JOIN resources r2 ON oel2.resource = r2.resource_id 
            WHERE r2.role = r.role 
            GROUP BY activity 
            HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
        ) THEN oel.case_id 
    END) as unusual_activity_cases,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (

FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
GROUP BY r.resource_id, r.role, r.department
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT oel.case_id) > 0;

-- 6. Time-based anomaly detection - activities happening too quickly
WITH activity_pairs AS (
    SELECT 
        oel1.case_id,
        oel1.activity as activity1,
        oel2.activity as activity2,
        oel1.timestamp as time1,
        oel2.timestamp as time2,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (oel2.timestamp - oel1.timestamp))/60 as minutes_between
    FROM order_event_log oel1
    JOIN order_event_log oel2 
        ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id 
        AND oel2.timestamp > oel1.timestamp

        ELSE 'Normal'
    END as flag
FROM activity_pairs
WHERE minutes_between < 15

-- 7. Cross-department handoff analysis to detect segregation of duties violations
WITH dept_transitions AS (
    SELECT 
        oel1.case_id,

            AND oel3.timestamp > oel1.timestamp
            AND oel3.timestamp < oel2.timestamp
    )
)
SELECT 
    case_id,
    from_dept,
    COUNT(DISTINCT to_dept) as unique_handoffs,
    same_dept_count,
    CASE 
        WHEN same_dept_count > 3 THEN 'WARNING: Multiple activities in same department'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END as sod_flag
FROM dept_transitions
GROUP BY case_id, from_dept, same_dept_count
HAVING same_dept_count > 3;

-- 8. Comprehensive anomaly scoring for each case
WITH case_anomalies AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        -- Check for out of order activities
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' AND EXISTS (
                SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oel2 
                WHERE oel2.case_id = oel.case_id 
                    AND oel2.activity IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock')
                    AND oel2.timestamp > oel.timestamp
            ) THEN 3 ELSE 0 END) as shipping_before_checks,
        -- Check for missing activities
        7 - COUNT(DISTINCT activity) as missing_activities,
        -- Check for payment before invoice
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' AND EXISTS (
                SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oel2 
                WHERE oel2.case_id = oel.case_id 
                    AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
                    AND oel2.timestamp > oel.timestamp
            ) THEN 2 ELSE 0 END) as payment_before_invoice,
        -- Check for rapid succession
        COUNT(CASE 
            WHEN EXISTS (
                SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oel2 
                WHERE oel2.case_id = oel.case_id 
                    AND oel2.timestamp > oel.timestamp
                    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (oel2.timestamp - oel.timestamp))/60 < 5
            ) THEN 1 END) as rapid_activities
    FROM order_event_log oel
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT 
    ca.*,
    o.order_value,
    o.order_type,
    (shipping_before_checks * 3 + missing_activities * 2 + payment_before_invoice * 2 + rapid_activities) as risk_score,
    CASE 
        WHEN (shipping_before_checks * 3 + missing_activities * 2 + payment_before_invoice * 2 + rapid_activities) >= 5 THEN 'HIGH RISK'
        WHEN (shipping_before_checks * 3 + missing_activities * 2 + payment_before_invoice * 2 + rapid_activities) >= 3 THEN 'MEDIUM RISK'
        WHEN (shipping_before_checks * 3 + missing_activities * 2 + payment_before_invoice * 2 + rapid_activities) > 0 THEN 'LOW RISK'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as risk_level
FROM case_anomalies ca
JOIN orders o ON ca.case_id = o.case_id
ORDER BY risk_score DESC;
```

These queries will help identify:
- Process violations and their severity
- Resource-specific patterns that might indicate training needs or malicious behavior
- Systemic issues with timing and sequencing
- Cases requiring immediate audit attention
- Patterns that could indicate fraud or system manipulation

The investigation should prioritize high-risk cases (especially case 1004 with payment before service) and implement immediate controls to prevent future occurrences.
