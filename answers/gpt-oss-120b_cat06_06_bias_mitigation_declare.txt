We need to output updated dictionary with added constraints. Provide rationale. Ensure formatting: code block with python. Use proper dictionary syntax. Add new constraints: maybe under "coexistence", "response", "noncoexistence", "nonsuccession". Provide entries.

We need to keep existing entries and add new ones. For unary constraints maybe add existence for ManualReview? Could add existence: ManualReview must exist. Also maybe add noncoexistence between CheckApplicantRace and Reject without BiasMitigationCheck.

Define activities: CheckApplicantRace, BiasMitigationCheck, ManualReview, Approve, Reject, Approve_Minority, Reject_Minority maybe.

Add to "coexistence": mapping from decision steps for sensitive applicants to ManualReview. For example, "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {...}} and "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {...}}.

Add to "response": ensure that after CheckApplicantRace, must have BiasMitigationCheck before decision. Could use response constraint: "CheckApplicantRace" -> "BiasMitigationCheck". Also "BiasMitigationCheck" -> "Approve"/"Reject". But we need to ensure not immediate. Use nonsuccession: prevent direct succession from CheckApplicantRace to Approve/Reject. So add entries under "nonsuccession": "CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve": {...}}, "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {...}}.

Add "succession": maybe "BiasMitigationCheck" -> "Approve" and "Reject". Also "succession": "BiasMitigationCheck" -> "Approve_Minority"/"Reject_Minority". Or use "response". Let's add under "response": "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {...}, "Reject": {...}}.

Add existence for BiasMitigationCheck maybe.

Add init maybe not needed.

Add "absence": maybe ensure absence of direct decision after race check without manual review. But we already have nonsuccession.

Add "noncoexistence": maybe ensure that ManualReview does not coexist with no decision? Not needed.

We'll produce updated dictionary.

Make sure to keep original entries unchanged, just add new ones. Provide rationale after code.

Let's craft.

### Rationale for the added constraints

| Constraint type | New entry (example) | Why it helps mitigate bias |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **existence** (unary) | `"ManualReview"` and `"BiasMitigationCheck"` | Guarantees that every trace contains a manual fairness review and an explicit bias‑mitigation step, making them unavoidable parts of the process. |
| **coexistence** (binary) | `"Approve_Minority"` → `"ManualReview"` and `"Reject_Minority"` → `"ManualReview"` | If a decision concerning a sensitive demographic is taken, a manual review must also be present, ensuring extra scrutiny for those cases. |
| **response** (binary) | `"CheckApplicantRace"` → `"BiasMitigationCheck"` | After the system observes a sensitive attribute, it must first run a mitigation check before any further actions. |
| **response** (binary) | `"BiasMitigationCheck"` → decision activities (`Approve`, `Reject`, …) | Guarantees that a decision can only be made *after* the mitigation check has been executed, preventing decisions based solely on raw attribute data. |
| **succession** (binary) | `"BiasMitigationCheck"` → decision activities | Reinforces the temporal ordering: the mitigation check must be the immediate predecessor of any decision, closing the window for biased shortcuts. |
| **nonsuccession** (negative binary) | `"CheckApplicantRace"` → decision activities | Disallows a direct succession from a sensitive‑attribute check to a decision, eliminating the possibility of an immediate biased outcome without the mitigation step. |

Together, these constraints embed fairness checks into the process model, ensuring that:

* Sensitive attribute observations trigger an explicit bias‑mitigation activity.
* Decisions for sensitive applicants cannot be made without a manual review.
* The process flow enforces a safe ordering that blocks “race‑check → reject/approve” shortcuts.

By encoding these rules in DECLARE, any trace that violates them will be flagged as non‑conformant, prompting process designers to redesign or add missing fairness steps.
