**Comprehensive Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels**

### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

**Data Preprocessing and Integration**
- **Challenge**: Speedy Parcels’ data comes from multiple sources (GPS, scanners, dispatch, maintenance), requiring alignment of timestamps, case IDs, and activity granularity. Mismatches (e.g., scanner events lack GPS precision, maintenance logs lack vehicle location) could lead to gaps.
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - **Event Alignment**: Use *vehicle-day* as the case ID and align timestamps across systems (e.g., sync scanner’s “Arrive Customer” with GPS coordinates at that timestamp).
  - **Data Enrichment**: Augment scanner events with GPS speed/location and maintenance logs with route context (e.g., tag unscheduled stops with nearby route segments).
  - **Handling Missing Data**: Interpolate GPS points during scanner-only events (e.g., assume vehicle is stationary at customer location during “Delivery Success”).
  - **Outlier Detection**: Filter unrealistic speeds or impossible location jumps (e.g., 100 km/h in urban areas).

**Process Discovery**
- Use **Inductive Miner** to derive a petri net of the end-to-end process, highlighting activities like “Depart Depot,” “Delivery Success/Fail,” “Traffic Delay,” and “Unscheduled Stop.”
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps of geographic clusters of traffic delays (GPS data) and bottlenecks (e.g., repeated stops at a congested intersection). Timeline views could show idle durations between “Arrive” and “Depart Customer.”

**Conformance Checking**
- Compare discovered models with dispatch system’s planned routes using **Token-based Replay**.
- **Deviations to Detect**:
  - **Sequence Deviations**: Drivers skipping stops, extra stops (e.g., unplanned detours).
  - **Timing Differences**: Significant delays between “Route Assigned” and “Depart Depot” (start-of-shift inefficiencies).
  - **Resource Mismatches**: Assigned driver/vehicle not present at events (e.g., scanner shows D105 but GPS has V15).
- **Metrics**: Fitness score (percentage of events conforming to plan), log movement cost (penalty for deviations).

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

**KPI Calculation**
- **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR)**: Ratio of “Delivery Success” within customer time windows (extracted from dispatch data) to total successful deliveries.
- **Average Time per Stop**:  between “Arrive Customer” and “Depart Customer” (aggregate per route).
- **Travel/Service Time Ratio**: (Total GPS moving time) / (total scanner “Arrive”-“Depart” durations).
- **Fuel per km/package**: Total fuel used (from maintenance logs) / (total km traveled × packages delivered).
- **Traffic Delay Frequency**: Count GPS events with “Low Speed Detected” or unscheduled stops clustered geographically.

**Bottleneck Techniques**
- **Root-Cause Analysis with Decision Trees**: Train a model on route features (geographic sector, time slot) to predict high delivery times.
- **Geo-Visualization**: Overlay GPS speeds on route maps to identify persistent traffic hotspots.
- **DoT Thresholds**: Tag stops with “Excessive Dwell Time” (>95th percentile of service times).

**Example Bottlenecks**:
- **High Traffic Zones**: 6.1E longitude shows repeated 5:00–9:00 AM slowdowns (GPS clusters).
- **Parking Delays**: Urban stops (50.81N) have “Arrive”-“Delivery” gaps averaging 12 mins (scanner notes “Finding parking”).
- **Driver-Specific Variability**: D302’s routes have 30% more deviations than median.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

**Potential Root Causes and Validations**
- **Suboptimal Route Planning (Static)**:
  - **Validation**: Compare planned vs. actual paths. Many delivery stops deviate from dispatch routes, especially after failed deliveries (re-routing is ad-hoc).
- **Inaccurate Travel Times**:
  - **Validation**: Correlate GPS-based travel times vs. dispatch estimates. Routes underestimate delays by 40% in peak hours.
- **Traffic Congestion Patterns**:
  - **Validation**: Cluster GPS slowdowns; identify 7:30–8:30 AM/5:00–6:00 PM congestion peaks along major corridors.
- **High Service Time Variability**:
  - **Validation**: Compare dwell times by package size. “Fragile” packages (scanner-tagged) require 50% longer handling.
- **Vehicle Breakdowns**:
  - **Validation**: Correlate “Unscheduled Stop” with maintenance logs. 15% of breakdowns occur within 3 hours of “Depart Depot.”

**Variant Analysis**
- Compare high-OTDR (Timely) vs. low-OTDR (Delayed) routes. Timely routes avoid 50.8N/6.1E zones, use rear access doors (shorter dwell time).

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing with Real-Time Traffic Integration**
- **Inefficiency**: Static routes ignore live traffic/weather, causing backups.
- **Root Cause**: Dispatch system uses average travel times, not real-time data.
- **Proposal**: Ingest live traffic feeds (e.g., Google Maps API) into dispatch, triggering route recalculations when GPS detects delays.
- **Process Mining Support**: Identify routes with >20% deviation from planned times; map these to traffic clusters.
- **Expected Impact**: 15% improvement in OTDR, 10% fuel savings (reduced idling).

**Strategy 2: Delivery Territory Optimization Using Historical Performance**
- **Inefficiency**: Unbalanced workload among routes (some drivers handle 50% more packages/day).
- **Root Cause**: Territories assigned without considering package density/dwell time variability.
- **Proposal**: Cluster delivery points by “geo-cells” (1km² grids) and assign based on historical KPIs (avg time per cell, failure rate).
- **Process Mining Support**: Segment log by delivery density, correlate with stop/start times.
- **Expected Impact**: 20% reduction in avg time per stop, 12% cut in overtime costs.

**Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**
- **Inefficiency**: Unscheduled breakdowns (3.2 breaks/vehicle/month) disrupt deliveries.
- **Root Cause**: Reactive maintenance (breakdowns trigger repairs).
- **Proposal**: Train ML models on maintenance logs + GPS telemetry (e.g., idle duration, speed/acceleration patterns) to predict failures 72 hours in advance.
- **Process Mining Support**: Link “Unscheduled Stop” events with prior 48-hour GPS data (e.g., frequent ignition cycles before breakdown).
- **Expected Impact**: 30% fewer breakdowns, 5% lower maintenance costs.

### **5. Constraints Monitoring and Continuous Optimization**

**Operational Constraints**
- **Driver Hours**: Schedule re-routes to only suggest changes within 8-hour shift limits (from driver log start/end times).
- **Vehicle Capacity**: Correlate package load data (from dispatch) with “Failed Delivery” rates. Overload alerts when capacity >90%.
- **Customer Time Windows**: Overlay delivery times with window constraints; flag routes missing windows by >30 mins.

**Monitoring Dashboard**
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Daily OTDR (by route/driver).
  - Fuel efficiency trend (km/L).
  - Breakdown frequency per vehicle.
- **Process Views**:
  - “Hotstop” map: Current/recent slowdowns for dispatchers.
  - Driver performance scorecard: Rank drivers by OTDR and breakdown rates.
  - Maintenance anomaaly detector: Flag vehicles with unusual idle patterns (early warning for breakdowns).

**Post-Implementation Check**
- Quarterly process conformance checks to validate model adherence.
- Alert thresholds for regression (e.g., OTDR drops below 85% for 3 consecutive days).

This approach transforms Speedy Parcels’ data into actionable insights, addressing both symptoms (delays) and root causes (static routing, reactive maintenance). By embedding process mining into daily operations, the company can sustain efficiency gains and rapidly adapt to new challenges.
