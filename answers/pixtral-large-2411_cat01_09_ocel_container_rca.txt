Based on the provided directly follows graph and the event log data, several specific performance issues can be identified. Here are some root causes for the performance issues in the process:

1. **High Duration for Certain Activities**:
   - **Order Empty Containers -> Pick Up Empty Container (Container)**: The duration is extremely high (368943.92), indicating a significant delay in picking up empty containers after they are ordered.
   - **Place in Stock -> Bring to Loading Bay (Container)**: The duration is very high (743380.51), suggesting that containers remain in stock for a long time before being brought to the loading bay.
   - **Depart -> Depart (Transport Document)**: The duration is very high (1051301.41), indicating that vehicles might be waiting or delayed significantly after departure.

2. **Frequent Repetitive Activities**:
   - **Load Truck -> Load Truck (Truck and Container)**: This activity sequence has a high frequency (8559 events), which might indicate inefficiencies in the loading process, such as multiple loads for the same truck or container.
   - **Load to Vehicle -> Load to Vehicle (Vehicle)**: This sequence also has a high frequency (1827 events), suggesting that vehicles are being loaded multiple times, which could be inefficient.
   - **Book Vehicles -> Book Vehicles (Vehicle)**: This sequence has a high frequency (585 events) and a high duration (295965.56), indicating potential inefficiencies in the booking process.

3. **Bottlenecks in Specific Activities**:
   - **Weigh -> Place in Stock (Forklift)**: The duration is relatively high (26927.52), which might indicate delays in placing containers in stock after weighing.
   - **Register Customer Order -> Create Transport Document (Customer Order)**: The duration is high (329005.22), suggesting delays in creating transport documents after registering customer orders.

4. **Inefficiencies in Rescheduling**:
   - **Reschedule Container (Various Object Types)**: The sequences involving rescheduling containers (e.g., Reschedule Container -> Load to Vehicle, Reschedule Container -> Book Vehicles) have high durations, indicating that rescheduling processes are time-consuming and might be causing delays.

5. **High Frequency with Low Object Count**:
   - **Load to Vehicle -> Load to Vehicle (Forklift)**: Although the frequency is high (1753 events), the number of objects involved is low (3), suggesting that a few forklifts are handling a disproportionately high number of loads, which could lead to bottlenecks.

6. **Long Durations for Critical Activities**:
   - **Drive to Terminal -> Load Truck (Truck)**: The duration is very high (84119.09), indicating significant delays in loading trucks after driving to the terminal.
   - **Load to Vehicle -> Depart (Vehicle)**: The duration is high (72985.89), suggesting delays in departing after loading vehicles.

Addressing these specific issues could involve optimizing the scheduling of activities, improving the efficiency of repetitive tasks, and reducing delays in critical processes.
