Below is a compact POWL model that describes the behaviour visible in the five example traces.

Legend:  
• X (…)   = XOR-choice (exclusive OR)  
• * (…)   = LOOP (first child is the “do-once / exit”, second child is the “redo” branch)  
•        = silent transition (skip)


1. Atomic activities (Transitions)

OR  = Transition(label="OR")          # Order Received  
MS  = Transition(label="MS")          # Material Sourcing  
QS  = Transition(label="QS")          # Quality Screening  
AS  = Transition(label="AS")          # Assembly  
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")         # In-line Quality Check  
TST = Transition(label="TST")         # Testing  
RT  = Transition(label="RT")          # Re-Testing  
PK  = Transition(label="PK")          # Packaging  
LB  = Transition(label="LB")          # Labelling  
DP  = Transition(label="DP")          # Distribution Planning  
D   = Transition(label="D")           # Dispatch  
   = SilentTransition()              # used to model “skip labelling”

2. Compound POWL nodes

# 2.1  Assembly / in-line quality loop  
LOOP_AS_IQC = * ( AS , IQC )
# semantics: execute AS once, then optionally (IQC  AS) can repeat

# 2.2  Testing / re-testing loop  
LOOP_TST_RT = * ( TST , RT )
# semantics: execute TST once, then optionally (RT  TST) can repeat

# 2.3  Optional labelling  
XOR_LB = X ( LB ,  )
# either do LB or silently skip it

3. Global partial-order shell

root = PO = ( nodes = { OR, MS, QS,
                        LOOP_AS_IQC,
                        LOOP_TST_RT,
                        PK,
                        XOR_LB,
                        DP,
                        D },
              order = { OR   MS,
                        MS   QS,
                        QS   LOOP_AS_IQC,
                        LOOP_AS_IQC  LOOP_TST_RT,
                        LOOP_TST_RT  PK,
                        PK   XOR_LB,
                        XOR_LB  DP,
                        DP   D } )


Readable flow

OR  MS  QS  * ( AS , IQC )  * ( TST , RT )  PK  X ( LB ,  )  DP  D

Explanation of how the model fits the log

1. The strict sequence OR–MS–QS appears in every case.
2. After each assembly pass (AS), in-line quality checks (IQC) may force one or more extra AS/IQC rounds: modelled with the first LOOP.
3. After testing (TST) the product may fail and require one or more RT–TST rounds: modelled with the second LOOP.
4. Packaging (PK) is always performed next.
5. Labelling (LB) is optional (present in cases 1,3,4,5; absent in case 2): modelled with XOR(LB, ).
6. Distribution planning (DP) and Dispatch (D) always follow in this strict order.
7. No concurrency relations were observed, so every edge is a precedence edge.

This POWL structure captures all traces in the example log and allows exactly the observed optional and looping behaviour.
