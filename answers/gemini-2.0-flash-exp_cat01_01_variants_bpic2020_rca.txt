Okay, let's analyze the provided process variants and their performance data to identify root causes for performance issues. We'll focus on the data and specific process steps, avoiding general comments.

Here's a breakdown of the potential root causes based on the provided data:

**1. Rework Loops Due to Rejections:**

*   **Dominant Issue:** The most significant performance problems arise from complex rework loops involving rejections and resubmissions.  Many variants show patterns like:
    *   `...REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE...`
    *   `...REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE...`
    *   `...REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE...`
    *   and more complex examples containing multiple rejections
*   **Impact:** These rejections and loops drastically increase the process time (performance values) as evident by the higher performance and complex variants.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   **Administration Rejections:** Rejections by 'ADMINISTRATION' are the most frequent source of rework. This suggests that the initial submission is not meeting the criteria specified by Administration, and this issue has a large impact due to how common this is.
    *   **Supervisor Rejections:** Rejections by 'SUPERVISOR' also cause rework loops. This might mean the initial approval criteria from the administration did not align with the supervisor requirements or those criteria were not checked upfront.
    *   **Pre-Approver Rejections:** While less frequent, 'PRE_APPROVER' rejections also contribute to rework loops and high performance times. It is important to note that the number of times that a document goes to a pre-approver it goes to a supervisor afterwards meaning that even if the rejection by pre-approver doesn't happen, it still has a big impact on the overall performance.
*   **Data Observation:** Variants with multiple rejection loops have significantly higher performance times (e.g., 2,542,497.917 or even 3,502,608.250).
*   **Example:** The variant with frequency 4 shows the largest performance of 3,502,608.250 with 3 loops and the variant with frequency 5 shows performance of 13,805,869.200 with a single rejection

**2. Impact of 'BUDGET OWNER' Approval and Rejection:**

*  **Impact:**  The process flow involving 'BUDGET OWNER' shows that adding a approval step or a rejection step creates performance issues. This indicates that the inclusion of a Budget Owner in the approval workflow is a potential point for delays.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   The most common pattern with Budget Owner is :`...Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> ...`. The performance for this variant is not bad (1,084,338.407) but the same variant with a single rejection `...Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER` has a worse average performance.
    *   The problem is exacerbated when there is a rejection by the budget owner as it creates a rework loop (e.g., with frequency 20 or 4).
*   **Data Observation:** Variants that have 'BUDGET OWNER' in the normal approval flow have lower performance than the ones without, and the ones with rejections have a substantially higher performance.

**3.  "MISSING" Rejections**

*   **Issue:** The "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" activity appears in several variants, indicating a system or data issue. This rejection happens only after the supervisor has approved the document.
*   **Impact:** This rejection introduces unnecessary loops and delays, contributing to higher performance times.
*  **Data Observation:** Although the frequency is relatively low, the performance tends to be high compared to other flows such as the one with the budget owner.

**4. Variations in the Standard Process Flow**

*   **Issue:** The variations in the number of approval steps such as having PRE_APPROVER or BUDGET OWNER as extra steps can be a contributing factor to the overall performance. The default path is having ADMINISTRATION and SUPERVISOR in the approval flow.
*   **Impact:** The additional steps add to the overall time of the process as shown by the average time of variants containing these steps.

**5. Direct to 'SUPERVISOR' Approval**

*   **Issue:**  Some variants skip 'ADMINISTRATION' and go directly to 'SUPERVISOR', indicated by the flow: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> ...`.
*   **Impact:**  While seemingly faster, the fact that the frequency of this is lower than the standard path implies it could be an exception.
* **Data Observation:** The performance time for this is still higher than the path going directly with administration and supervisor with no budget owner or pre-approver, indicating this path is an exception. Also, there are cases where the document gets rejected by MISSING implying it's not a good or standard path.

**6. Performance of Single Occurrences**
* **Issue:** Some of the variants with smaller frequencies show the biggest performance issues.
* **Impact:** This indicates that the biggest outliers are not the frequent variants, but the very rare ones.
* **Data Observation:** The variants with frequencies 4, 5, 6 and others with single-digit frequencies show performance times which exceed 2,000,000 or even 10,000,000.

**Summary of Root Causes (Data-Specific):**

*   **Rework loops caused by rejections (especially by Administration and Supervisor) are the biggest driver of poor performance.**
*  **The inclusion of "BUDGET OWNER" either for approval or rejection contributes to higher performance times.**
*   **Rejections due to "MISSING" data after Supervisor approval suggests a system or data issue.**
*  **Variations of the approval flow create extra steps which create higher performance times.**
*   **Process variations which skip steps or have rare flows tend to perform worse.**

**Recommendations based on Data:**

1.  **Investigate the high number of rejections by 'ADMINISTRATION' and 'SUPERVISOR'**: Understand why documents are being rejected, and improve criteria definition.
2.  **Review the 'BUDGET OWNER' approval and rejection process:** Analyze if this step can be optimized or if there is a reason that many rejections by this role are happening.
3.  **Address "MISSING" Rejections:** Find out why this happens and solve it as it is a clear data and process fault.
4.  **Examine the 'PRE_APPROVER' approval process:** Determine why the inclusion of this step introduces delays into the process.
5.  **Establish a standard process flow with few variants**: Investigate and address the reasons for the deviations from the normal flow of approvals and rejections.
6.  **Address outliers:** Investigate the outliers which happen with low frequency as they might be indicative of an underlying problem which is not frequent but very costly.

**Further Analysis (If Possible):**

*   **Time spent in each step:** If available, data on the average time spent in each activity (not just the total time per variant) would provide valuable insights.
*   **Reasons for rejections:** Gathering the most common reasons for rejections can help improve training and process design.
*   **User or data attribute analysis:** Investigating patterns of rejections by specific employees or related to specific data attributes can uncover more specific root causes.

By addressing these specific points, you should be able to significantly improve the performance of the declaration process.
