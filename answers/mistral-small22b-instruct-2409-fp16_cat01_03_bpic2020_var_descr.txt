 Based on the provided data, here's a description of the process:

1. **Employee Initiation**: The process begins when an employee submits a declaration (likely for reimbursement or approval of some kind).

2. **Administration Review**: After submission, the administration reviews the declaration. They can either approve it, reject it, or send it back to the employee for correction.
   - If approved, the process moves forward.
   - If rejected or sent back, the employee makes changes and resubmits the declaration.

3. **Additional Reviews**: Depending on the organization's structure and rules, additional reviews may be required after administration approval:
   - **Budget Owner Review**: In some cases, a budget owner reviews the declaration before it can proceed. They can either approve or reject it.
   - **Pre-approver Review**: In other scenarios, a pre-approver reviews and approves the declaration. This step might not be present in all cases.

4. **Supervisor Approval**: After passing the initial review(s), a supervisor provides the final approval for the declaration. They can either finalize the approval or reject it, sending it back to the employee.
   - If rejected, the employee resubmits the declaration, and the process repeats from step 1.

5. **Payment Request**: Once the declaration is finally approved, a request for payment is made.

6. **Payment Handling**: Finally, the payment is handled based on the approved declaration. This marks the end of the process for that specific declaration.

Here are some additional points based on the data:
- The frequency column indicates how many times a particular sequence occurred.
- The performance column represents the total monetary value associated with those sequences (likely the sum of all approved declarations in each sequence).
- Some sequences end with the supervisor rejecting the declaration, which leads to resubmission and restarts the process. Other sequences successfully end with payment handling after final approval.
- The data includes variations in the review process, with some declarations requiring additional reviews (like Budget Owner or Pre-approver) before final approval by the supervisor.
