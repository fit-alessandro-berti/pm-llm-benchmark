This visualization depicts a **process model** represented as a **Petri net**, a formal graphical tool used to model workflows and concurrent processes.

### Overall process description:
- **Start activity (`a`)**: The process begins with *register request*.
- The process then branches into three possible activities:
  - `b`: *examine thoroughly*
  - `c`: *examine casually*
  - `d`: *check ticket*
- These examination and check steps eventually converge at activity `e`: *decide*.
- After `e`, the process branches again:
  - `g`: *pay compensation*
  - `h`: *reject request*
- Both `g` and `h` lead to the final activity `z`: *end*.
- There is also a *reinitiate request* action (`f`) which loops back to earlier activities, indicating a retry or further examination.

### Gateway logic:
The process uses **logic gateways**, illustrated with black dots connected to squares, which define the flow of control:
- **XOR-split/join**: Only one path is taken or synchronized.
- **AND-split/join**: All outgoing paths must be taken simultaneously; all incoming must synchronize.
- **OR-split/join**: Any subset of outgoing paths; any synchronization of available incoming paths.

### Gateway legend:
The **grey panel in the bottom right corner** explains these notations:
- **XOR-split and XOR-join**: single-choice branching and merging.
- **AND-split and AND-join**: parallel branching and synchronization.
- **OR-split and OR-join**: inclusive branching and synchronization.

### Process behavior insights:
- The model supports **different examination paths** — concurrent or alternative.
- Possible **loops** if the request is *reinitiated* (activity `f`).
- After a decision (`e`), the process branches into either *pay* or *reject* before concluding.

### Summary:
This is a **workflow Petri net** illustrating a decision process — likely a **claims or service request handling workflow** — with concurrency, choice, and iteration handled via explicit gateway logic. The visualization provides clarity on which paths can be taken in parallel, exclusively, or inclusively.
