Section 1: Analyze resource behavior and assignment patterns

1.1 Metrics to compute from the event log
Build a case table, activity table, and resource table. Use timestamps (start/complete) and attributes (priority, category, required skill, tier, agent skills) to compute:

Across tiers
- Arrival rate by priority/category/skill and hour/day.
- Queueing and service times per tier: waiting time to first work, handling time per touch, total touch time, idle time between touches.
- First-contact resolution (FCR) at L1: % of tickets closed without escalation; FCR by category/skill/priority/channel.
- Escalation rate and depth: % escalated to L2, L3; number of handovers; escalation latency (time from L1 end to L2 start).
- Reassignment rate: count and % of cases with 1 reassignment; reassignment loops (e.g., L2L2, L2L1).
- SLA attainment per tier path: on-time close %, lateness distribution.

Per agent
- Workload distribution: tickets started/closed per agent per period; WIP; average concurrent WIP; utilization (busy time/shift time, derived from work start/end).
- Performance metrics: average handling time per activity; variance; throughput per day; FCR for L1 agents; resolution quality (reopen rate); SLA hit rate for cases touched.
- Skill usage: share of time spent on tasks matching agent’s declared skills vs. outside-skill tasks; mix by required skill.
- Queue latency contributed: average wait before/after this agent in path (position-based).

Per skill
- Demand vs. capacity by skill over time: tickets requiring ‘Networking-Firewall’, ‘DB-SQL’, etc. vs. available skill-hours by shift.
- Skill match rate: % of activities executed by agents who have the required skill; mismatch rates by category.
- Specialist dilution: % of specialist time spent on tasks that do not require their top skills; top-5 specialists by dilution.

1.2 Process mining techniques
- Discovery of actual assignment flows: Mine a process model (e.g., inductive miner) using activities like Assign L1/L2/L3, Work Start/End, Escalate, Reassign. Overlay performance (throughput times, waiting times) and frequencies to see typical paths, loops, and delays.
- Handover-of-work social network: Build resource/resource and role/resource graphs based on consecutive events on the same case. Metrics: handover frequency, betweenness centrality (bottleneck agents), density within/between tiers, common escalation paths by skill.
- Role discovery: Cluster resources by activity profiles and skills actually used to infer latent roles (e.g., “L2-DB”, “L2-Network”, “L1-Access Mgmt”). Compare inferred roles vs. documented tiers/skills to detect misalignments.
- Conformance checking: Encode intended assignment logic (e.g., L1 triage; L2 only after Escalate; skills must match; no L3 unless L2 touch exists) as a Petri net or declare constraints, then compute fitness/precision and per-constraint violations (e.g., % of tasks performed by non-matching skills, assignments that skipped dispatcher rules).
- Performance annotation by resource path: Compare round-robin intention vs. actual load allocation using replay logs; detect bias (certain dispatchers self-assign to known agents).

1.3 Skill utilization analysis
- Construct a “required-skill to executed-by-skill” matrix: rows = required skill (from Required Skill attribute or predicted), columns = agent skill tags. Quantify matches, near-misses, and mismatches.
- Proficiency weighting: If proficiency levels exist (e.g., novice/intermediate/expert), compute weighted skill match; measure cases where experts handle novice-tier tasks.
- Time-slicing analysis: By hour/day, compare skill demand with staffed skill capacity; identify recurrent gaps (e.g., DB-SQL spikes on Mondays 10–14h with only one skilled agent on shift).
- Segment by priority: Are experts diverted to P3/P4 work while P2 suffers? Compute expert-time share spent on P2/P3/P4.

Section 2: Identify resource-related bottlenecks and issues

2.1 Bottlenecks and how to pinpoint them
- Insufficient skill availability
  - Signal: Long queueing before first L2/L3 touch for tickets requiring a specific skill; high variance; recurring peak-hour backlogs.
  - Quantify: Average wait to first touch by required skill; heatmap by hour/day. Compute skill utilization: busy time/capacity; times with >85% utilization correlated with SLA misses.
- Delays from reassignments
  - Signal: Cases with >1 reassignment have significantly longer resolution times.
  - Quantify: Average added delay per reassignment (delta throughput time vs. matched cohort with similar priority/category). Report % SLA breaches with 1 reassignment.
- Incorrect initial assignments
  - Signal: High proportion of L1 touches followed by immediate Escalate with short L1 handling times; assignments to L2 that are then re-routed to another L2 skill.
  - Quantify: Mis-triage rate: % cases where first assignee lacks required skill; average triage-induced delay (AssignWork StartEscalateAssign L2).
- Overloaded vs underutilized agents
  - Signal: Agent-level queue latency contributions and utilization dispersion.
  - Quantify: Gini coefficient of workload, top/bottom decile utilization; correlation between agent utilization and their cases’ SLA breach rate.
- Assignment patterns vs SLA
  - Signal: Specific paths (e.g., L1L2L2 reassign) have higher breach odds.
  - Quantify: Logistic regression or uplift modeling: features = number of reassignments, skill mismatch flags, wait before first skilled touch, agent workload at assignment, priority; outcome = SLA breach. Report odds ratios.

2.2 Example quantified outputs
- Each reassignment adds a median 3.4 hours waiting; cases with 2 reassignments breach SLAs 2.1x more often.
- P2 Network-Firewall: 38% wait >2 hours for first L2 touch during 11:00–15:00; specialist utilization >95% then; 27% of P2 breaches linked to this skill bottleneck.
- L1 mis-triage: 24% of P3 Software-App routed to L2-DB-SQL after initial L2-App; median extra delay 1.6 hours per mis-triage.
- Expert dilution: L2 DB-SQL experts spend 31% of time on P3/P4 non-DB tasks; P2 DB tickets wait 1.2 hours longer on days when dilution >25%.

Section 3: Root cause analysis for assignment inefficiencies

3.1 Likely root causes
- Round-robin ignoring skills and workload: Conformance gaps showing frequent assignment to agents without required skill; variance in wait times linked to overloaded assignees.
- Incomplete/incorrect skill profiles: Role discovery shows agents performing certain skills not documented; mismatch matrix has many near-miss or unknown classifications.
- Poor initial categorization/skill tagging: High mis-triage rate from L1; free-text descriptions not leveraged; channel differences (phone vs portal) show higher error on portal.
- Lack of real-time visibility: Assignments made to busy agents; queue-aware dispatch absent; spikes not handled by flexible staffing.
- L1 capability gaps: Low FCR in categories where historical data shows other L1s can resolve; inconsistent knowledge usage.

3.2 Analytic methods to evidence root causes
- Variant analysis: Compare “happy path” cases (0 reassignments, 1 escalation) vs “problem path” (2 reassignments). Contrast features: initial category accuracy, dispatcher, time-of-day, agent skill match, channel, text features, required skill prediction confidence.
- Decision mining (e.g., decision trees on Escalate/Assign choices): Inputs = ticket attributes, L1 agent, dispatcher, queue lengths; Outputs = escalation choice, target skill. Identify systematic mis-routes (some dispatchers/agents produce higher mis-triage rates).
- Text mining for categorization quality: Use NLP on ticket descriptions to see where category/required-skill labels are wrong or missing; link to mis-triage.
- Capability analysis: FCR by L1 agent and category controlling for priority; identify training gaps.

Section 4: Data-driven resource assignment strategies

Strategy A: Skill-based routing with proficiency and certification
- Issue addressed: Mis-triage, reassignment loops, specialist dilution.
- Approach: Maintain a dynamic skill matrix with proficiency levels and recency. At assignment, select agents whose skills match required skill predicted from ticket features. Prefer highest fit with adequate proficiency; cap expert time on low-priority tasks.
- Data needed: Updated agent skill profiles, predicted required skill per ticket (from historical mapping or ML classifier), agent proficiency, shift calendars.
- How it uses insights: Uses required-skill to executed-by-skill matrix and mis-triage hotspots to define routing rules; conformance results guide constraints.
- Expected benefits: 20–40% reduction in reassignments; faster time to first skilled touch; improved SLA compliance on P2/P3; better specialist focus.

Strategy B: Workload-aware, queue-length and availability-based assignment
- Issue addressed: Overloaded agents and uneven utilization; long waits due to assigning to busy resources.
- Approach: Implement a dispatcher algorithm that considers current queue length, agent utilization, and estimated handling time per category/skill. Use shortest-expected-processing-time-first with skill feasibility. Incorporate priority aging.
- Data needed: Real-time WIP per agent, historical handling time distributions by agent/skill, agent calendars, priority SLAs.
- Insights leveraged: Utilization dispersion and queue latency contributions; time-of-day demand profiles.
- Expected benefits: 10–25% reduction in waiting time to first touch; lower SLA breaches due to load balancing; increased fairness in workload.

Strategy C: Predictive triage and required-skill classification using NLP
- Issue addressed: Incorrect initial categorization; unnecessary L2 involvement.
- Approach: Train a model on historical tickets (text, category, priority, channel) to predict required skill, likelihood of L1 resolution, and expected tier. Provide confidence score and recommended assignee pool. For high-confidence L1-resolvable cases, route to L1 specialist; for low-confidence, route to specialized L2 directly.
- Data needed: Event log with outcomes, ticket texts, historical reassignments and escalations, agent performance data.
- Insights leveraged: Variant analysis separating smooth vs problematic cases; decision mining rules.
- Expected benefits: 15–30% reduction in mis-triage; higher L1 FCR; fewer escalations.

Strategy D: Dynamic tier blending and flex staffing
- Issue addressed: Skill bottlenecks at peak times; P2 delays.
- Approach: Create a cross-trained “surge” pool (experienced L1/L2) who can be temporarily allocated to high-demand skills or priorities based on real-time demand thresholds. Use schedule optimization to align skill capacity to predicted peaks.
- Data needed: Demand forecasts by skill/priority, agent cross-skill proficiency, shift rosters.
- Insights leveraged: Time-sliced skill demand/capacity gaps; peak analysis.
- Expected benefits: 20%+ reduction in peak wait times; improved P2 SLA during busy windows.

Strategy E: Escalation and reassignment guardrails
- Issue addressed: Excessive reassignments and ping-pong.
- Approach: Enforce business rules: require evidence of performed diagnostics before escalation; require skill verification before accepting a reassignment; auto-route to correct sub-skill when reassignment loops detected; limit intra-tier ping-pong with rule-based approvals.
- Data needed: Conformance rules from mined model; skill ontology; diagnostic checklist completion events.
- Insights leveraged: Conformance checking identifying most common loop patterns and their delay impact.
- Expected benefits: Fewer reassignments; 1–2 hours saved per prevented loop; increased FCR quality.

Section 5: Simulation, implementation, and monitoring

5.1 Business process simulation before rollout

Operational alerts
- Real-time: Breach risk predictions; queue length thresholds by skill; utilization >90%; trigger surge pool activation.
- Weekly reviews: Outliers (agents with high mis-triage, categories with rising reassignment rate), root-cause drill-downs.

Quantifiable success targets
- Reduce average reassignments per case by 25–40% within 3 months.
- Improve P2 on-time SLA by 10–15 points; reduce time-to-first-skilled-touch by 30%.
- Increase L1 FCR by 5–10 points in targeted categories.
- Decrease specialist dilution by 20%, correlating with fewer P2 breaches in specialist domains.

By grounding routing decisions in mined skill-demand patterns, workload realities, and predictive triage, and validating via simulation before scaling, TechSolve can systematically reduce delays, cut reassignments, protect specialist time, and improve SLA performance. Continuous monitoring with conformance and social network views ensures sustained alignment between intended and actual resource assignment behavior.
