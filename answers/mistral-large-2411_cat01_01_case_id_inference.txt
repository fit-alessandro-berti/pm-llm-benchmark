To determine the groupings of events into separate cases, we need to look at the sequence of activities, timing, and common attributes such as patient age and gender. Here’s how we can group these events:

### Case 1:
- **Patient Age:** 45
- **Patient Gender:** M
- **Departments Involved:** ER, Radiology

1. **Event 1:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: insurance=private`

### Summary:
- **Case 1:** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
