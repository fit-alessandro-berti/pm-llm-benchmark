Here is the updated DECLARE model with new constraints designed to mitigate bias, along with a rationale for the additions.

To model the fairness checks, we introduce several new, conceptual activities into the process:
*   `CheckSensitiveAttribute`: Represents any activity that involves observing a sensitive attribute (e.g., race, age, gender).
*   `ManualReview`: A mandatory second look or human-in-the-loop verification step.
*   `BiasMitigationCheck`: An automated or manual check specifically designed to flag and correct for potential bias.
*   `NegativeDecision`: Represents a final decision that is unfavorable to the applicant (e.g., 'Reject').
*   `PositiveDecision`: Represents a final decision that is favorable to the applicant (e.g., 'Approve').

### Updated DECLARE Model

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # ADDED: If a sensitive attribute is checked, a manual review must also occur in the trace.
        "CheckSensitiveAttribute": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # ADDED: If a sensitive attribute is checked, a bias mitigation check must eventually follow.
        "CheckSensitiveAttribute": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        # ADDED: If a decision is made (positive or negative), a bias mitigation check must have occurred beforehand.
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {
            "NegativeDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "PositiveDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },

    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        # ADDED: A negative decision cannot immediately follow the checking of a sensitive attribute.
        "CheckSensitiveAttribute": {"NegativeDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints

The new constraints are designed to enforce fairness and prevent discriminatory outcomes by adding mandatory checks and balances to the process flow.

1.  **`coexistence("CheckSensitiveAttribute", "ManualReview")`**
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure extra scrutiny for applications involving sensitive demographic data.
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint mandates that whenever a sensitive attribute is part of the process trace (`CheckSensitiveAttribute`), a `ManualReview` must also occur. This prevents fully automated or hasty decisions for these cases, enforcing a "human-in-the-loop" review to catch and correct potential biases that an automated system might perpetuate.

2.  **`nonsuccession("CheckSensitiveAttribute", "NegativeDecision")`**
    *   **Purpose:** To prevent immediate, reactive negative decisions based on sensitive information.
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint forbids a `NegativeDecision` from occurring *immediately* after a `CheckSensitiveAttribute`. It enforces a "cooling-off" period, requiring at least one other activity to happen in between. This makes it more difficult for the process to reflect a direct, knee-jerk reaction to sensitive data and encourages intermediate, more objective evaluation steps.

3.  **`response("CheckSensitiveAttribute", "BiasMitigationCheck")` and `precedence("BiasMitigationCheck", ...)`**
    *   **Purpose:** To enforce a mandatory "fairness checkpoint" before any final decision is made in cases involving sensitive data.
    *   **Rationale:** This combination of constraints creates a powerful fairness gateway:
        *   The **`response`** constraint ensures that if a `CheckSensitiveAttribute` happens, a `BiasMitigationCheck` is triggered and *must* eventually occur later in the trace.
        *   The **`precedence`** constraint ensures that for any `NegativeDecision` or `PositiveDecision` to occur, the `BiasMitigationCheck` must have already happened.
    *   Together, these rules guarantee that no final decision can be made on a case involving sensitive attributes without first passing through a dedicated bias-auditing step.
