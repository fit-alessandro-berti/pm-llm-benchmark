To group the events into separate cases, we need to identify which events belong to the same patient's journey through the hospital. We will use the attributes patient_age, patient_gender, and timestamp to infer the case groupings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:

Step-by-Step Reasoning
Identify Unique Patient Combinations:

Patient 1: 45, M
Patient 2: 62, F
Patient 3: 28, M
Group Events by Patient:

Patient 1 (45, M):

Registration
Initial triage
X-ray imaging
Doctor consultation
Patient discharged
Patient 2 (62, F):

Registration
Initial triage
Lab test requested
Lab test completed
Doctor consultation
Prescription created
Patient discharged
Patient 3 (28, M):

Registration
Doctor consultation
Surgery preparation
Surgery performed
Recovery room
Patient discharged
