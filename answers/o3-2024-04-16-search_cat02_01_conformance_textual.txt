Below is a concise verdict for every case, followed by the rule(s) that are broken.  
Only the cases that break at least one rule are marked “Non-conformant”.

Key rules distilled from the normative text  
R-1  “Check inventory” must be done before any of the following: Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Cancel order.  
R-2  Two alternative paths exist:  
A (Fulfilment)Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order  
B (Cancellation) Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order  
R-3  In the fulfilment path the strict order Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order must be kept.  
R-4  If “Cancel order” occurs, no Authorize payment, Package items or Ship order may appear afterwards.  
R-5  “Close order” must be the very last activity.

(Everything else follows the fulfilment path, but the premature packaging is disallowed.)

Case 3Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  CloseNon-conformant  
• Authorize payment appears even though the case eventually cancels  violates choice between Path A and B (R-2).  
• Ship order occurs after Cancel order  violates R-4.  
(Thus two separate violations.)
