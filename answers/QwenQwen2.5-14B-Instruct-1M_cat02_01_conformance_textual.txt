### Analysis of Event Log Cases Against the Normative Process Description

#### Case 1:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order
- **Compliance:** This case adheres to the normative process. The order was checked for inventory, payment was authorized after inventory check, items were packaged after payment authorization, and the order was shipped and closed in the correct sequence.

#### Case 2:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:** The order was packaged before the payment was authorized. According to the normative process, "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment". This sequence violates the rule that packaging should only happen after payment authorization, which ensures that the payment method is valid and approved before proceeding to prepare the items for shipment.

#### Case 3:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:** The order was authorized for payment even though it was subsequently canceled. The normative process clearly states that "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging, and it should not occur if the order is to be canceled. Additionally, "Ship order" should not occur after a cancellation. The correct sequence for a canceled order should be "Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order".

#### Case 4:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order
- **Compliance:** This case adheres to the normative process for an insufficient inventory scenario. The order was checked for inventory, canceled because of insufficient stock, and then properly closed.

#### Case 5:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:** The order was shipped without being packaged. According to the normative process, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items". This sequence violates the rule that items must be prepared for shipment before they can be shipped, ensuring that the correct and complete items are sent to the customer.

### Summary of Violations:
- **Case 2:** Violates the rule that "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment".
- **Case 3:** Violates the rule that "Authorize payment" should not occur if the order is to be canceled, and "Ship order" should not occur after a cancellation.
- **Case 5:** Violates the rule that "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items".

These deviations from the normative process highlight the importance of adhering to the defined sequence of activities to ensure proper order handling and customer satisfaction.
