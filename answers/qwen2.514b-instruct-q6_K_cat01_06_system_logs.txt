### Process Mining Event Log Transformation

Given the system log provided, we aim to convert it into an event log that can be analyzed with process mining tools. Below is a transformation of the logs based on our objectives:

### Explanation

**Case Identification and Grouping:**

To determine cases, we primarily look at the context of user interactions with documents or applications over a session. Each logical unit of work (e.g., editing a document, responding to an email) is grouped into a single case.

- **Case 1:** Represents continuous work on Document1.docx followed by switching to and replying to an email.
- **Case 2:** Focuses on reviewing Report_Draft.pdf with some highlighting action.
- **Case 3:** Involves working on Budget_2024.xlsx, then returning to Document1.docx for updates.
- **Case 4:** Concludes the work session by editing Quarterly_Report.docx.

**Activity Naming:**

We aim for a higher-level abstraction of actions that can be understood in a business process context:

- "Switch To" is used when transitioning between applications or documents, indicating the start of a new task within the same case.
- Actions like "Scroll," "Highlight," and "Type" are grouped into more meaningful activities such as "Write Report," "Reply to Email," etc., based on their intent in the workflow.

This transformation simplifies the interpretation by analysts while maintaining essential details for process understanding.
