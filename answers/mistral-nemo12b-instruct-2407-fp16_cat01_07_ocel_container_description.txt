Based on the provided object-centric event log and its directly follows graph, here's a description of the underlying process:

1. **Customer Order Management**
   - A new customer order is registered.
   - For each order, a transport document is created.

2. **Transport Document Management**
   - Vehicles are booked for the transport based on the transport document.
   - Empty containers are ordered to accommodate the goods.
   - The process then branches into two main paths:

     **Path 1: Direct Transport**
     - The booked vehicles depart directly, carrying the goods in the containers.

     **Path 2: Container Handling and Rescheduling (if needed)**
     - Containers are picked up empty and loaded with goods at the loading bay using forklifts.
       - Forklifts bring containers to the loading bay, weigh them, load them onto vehicles, or place them in stock.
       - If a container needs to be weighed before loading, it's brought to the weighing station first.
     - Containers are then driven to the terminal for further processing.
     - At the terminal, containers may undergo several activities:
       - They can be loaded directly onto another vehicle ('Load to Vehicle') or depart immediately if no further action is needed.
       - If there's an issue or a need for rescheduling, containers might go through 'Reschedule Container' activity before being loaded onto a vehicle or departing.

3. **Vehicle Management**
   - Vehicles can be booked in advance ('Book Vehicles'), and they may also undergo rescheduling if needed.
   - Once ready, vehicles depart with the loaded containers.

4. **Handling Unit (Goods) Management**
   - Goods are collected from their source.
   - After being loaded onto a truck, goods are driven to the terminal for further processing or departure.

Here's a simplified process flow based on the most frequent paths:

1. Register Customer Order
2. Create Transport Document
3. Book Vehicles
4. Order Empty Containers
5. Pick Up Empty Container
6. Load Truck (Handling Unit)
7. Drive to Terminal (Truck)
8. Load Truck (Container) -> Load to Vehicle (Vehicle) -> Depart (Vehicle, Handling Unit)

For some containers, additional steps may be required due to rescheduling or weighing:

1. Weigh (Container)
2. Place in Stock (Container)
3. Bring to Loading Bay (Container)
4. Reschedule Container (Transport Document, Vehicle, Container)
