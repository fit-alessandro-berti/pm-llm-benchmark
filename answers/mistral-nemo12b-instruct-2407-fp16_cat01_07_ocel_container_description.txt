Based on the provided data, which appears to be a process mining dataset, we can infer the following supply chain processes involving Customer Orders and Transport Documents:

1. **Customer Order Process:**

   - The process begins with "Register Customer Order".
   - After registration, a "Transport Document" is created for each order.
   - Each order (frequency of objects = 594) takes approximately 329005.22 seconds (around 91 hours and 36 minutes) to complete the "Create Transport Document" event.

2. **Transport Document Process:**

   - After a transport document is created, vehicles are booked for each order (594 documents, one booking per document).
   - Booking vehicles takes about 22207.07 seconds (around 6 hours and 13 minutes) on average.
   - Once vehicles are booked, empty containers need to be ordered for each transport document (593 documents). Ordering containers takes approximately 43935.45 seconds (around 12 hours and 8 minutes).
   - After ordering containers, the process moves towards "Depart". However, some containers may need rescheduling due to various reasons like delays or cancellations.
     - "Reschedule Container" can occur from both "Order Empty Containers" and after an attempted "Depart".
     - The total duration for these rescheduling events varies significantly (255614.86 seconds to 298469.31 seconds).
   - When containers are successfully scheduled, they depart. There's also a "Reschedule Container" loop before departure, which involves another set of delays.
     - The average time for the initial "Depart" event is approximately 1051301.41 seconds (around 292 hours and 8 minutes), while rescheduling before departure takes around 275189.97 seconds (around 76 hours and 27 minutes).
   - There's also a self-loop in "Depart", suggesting that departures might be delayed or rescheduled due to various reasons.

3. **Interleaved Processes with Customer Order Process:**

   - Apart from the main process, there are several events related to customer orders that occur simultaneously:
     - "Place in Stock" -> "Weigh"
     - "Load to Vehicle" -> "Weigh"
     - "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Weigh"
     - "Weigh" -> "Load to Vehicle"
     - "Weigh" -> "Bring to Loading Bay"
   - These events involve weighing and moving customer orders between different locations, ultimately leading to the loading of vehicles for transportation.

4. **Self-Loops:**

   - There are self-loop events observed in "Place in Stock", "Load to Vehicle", "Bring to Loading Bay", and "Weigh". These loops suggest that objects could revisit these states before proceeding further, indicating potential rework or delay.

5. **Object Frequencies and Durations:**

   - The frequency of objects (customer orders) in most events is 3, suggesting that batches of three orders are processed together.
   - The duration for each event varies significantly, reflecting the complexity and variability in processing times within this supply chain process.

Based on these observations, it seems that the underlying processes involve complex order management, inventory handling, transportation planning, and rescheduling due to various uncertainties or disruptions.
