1) What key insights from market research most influence the decision to proceed with prototype design, and how are conflicting signals reconciled?
2) How do we determine the optimal point to split into parallel component procurement, and what criteria trigger reprioritization among suppliers?
3) What are the trade-offs between single-sourcing versus multi-sourcing for each critical component, and how do we quantify resilience gains versus cost premiums?
4) How do geopolitical risks, tariffs, and export controls shape supplier selection and contingency planning in each region?
5) What lead time reduction opportunities exist across the parallel procurement streams without increasing quality risk or supplier fatigue?
6) How do we decide between air freight and ocean freight beyond demand urgency—e.g., evaluating carbon footprint, cost-to-serve, and brand impact?
7) What decision thresholds define when a failed quality check should trigger rework versus scrap, and how are these thresholds calibrated over time?
8) How is 24/7 assembly balanced with workforce well-being, automation ROI, and defect rates to maintain both productivity and quality?
9) What mechanisms ensure that packaging, labeling, and regulatory documentation stay synchronized with fast-changing market requirements?
10) How do we measure and act on variability in customs clearance times across regions to reduce bottlenecks and inventory holding costs?
11) What data-sharing agreements and interfaces are in place with regional distribution centers to enable real-time visibility and exception management?
12) How are demand forecasts reconciled between retail, e-commerce, and VIP/pre-order channels, and who arbitrates when priorities conflict?
13) What KPIs best capture the effectiveness of the parallel distribution streams (e.g., on-time-in-full, cost-to-serve, cycle time, return rates)?
14) How do we systematically detect and mitigate bullwhip effects when adjusting supplier orders due to demand changes?
15) What scenario planning and stress testing frameworks are used to evaluate disruptions (supplier failure, port closures, regulatory shifts)?
16) How do we ensure ethical sourcing and ESG compliance across multiple countries, and how are non-compliance risks escalated and remediated?
17) What governance structure defines decision rights at each gateway, and how do we document and audit these decisions for continuous improvement?
18) How are lessons learned from rework, scrap, and returns fed back into R&D, supplier quality management, and assembly processes?
19) What technology stack (e.g., digital twins, advanced planning systems, IoT) could most significantly improve end-to-end synchronization and responsiveness?
20) How do we balance inventory positioning across regional DCs to optimize service levels while minimizing working capital and obsolescence risk?
