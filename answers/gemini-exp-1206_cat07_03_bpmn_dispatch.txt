This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the process of dispatching goods from a computer hardware shop. The diagram is divided into three swimlanes, representing the departments involved:

1. **Logistics:** This swimlane handles the insurance of the parcel.
2. **Dispatch of goods - Computer Hardware Shop (Secretary):** This swimlane represents the core process, including:
    *   Starting with "Ship goods" event.
    *   Clarifying the shipment method.
    *   Checking if insurance is required based on customer information.
    *   Getting offers from logistic companies.
    *   Writing package label.
    *   Selecting a logistic company and placing the order.
    *   Handling special cases, possibly needing to go back to clarify shipment method
3. **Warehouse:** This swimlane is responsible for:
    *   Packaging goods.
    *   Notifying the customer if there's a delay (more than 48 hours).
    *   Filling out shipment paperwork.
    *   Moving the package to the pickup area.
    *   Ending with "Shipment prepared" event.

**Key elements in the diagram:**

*   **Events:** Circles represent events like "Ship goods" (start) and "Shipment prepared" (end).
*   **Activities:** Rounded rectangles represent tasks like "Clarify shipment method," "Insure parcel," and "Package goods."
*   **Gateways:** Diamonds represent decision points or parallel actions. For example, the diamond labeled "Special handling?" is a decision gateway, while the diamond after "Write package label" and before "Select logistic company" is a parallel gateway.
*   **Data Objects:** The document icon represents "Order details", and the cylinder icon represents "Customer information".
*   **Sequence Flows:** Arrows show the order of activities.

**Overall, the diagram depicts a well-defined process for shipping goods, including decision points for special handling and insurance, parallel tasks for getting logistics offers and writing labels, and a clear handover between the secretary and the warehouse.**
