The graphic is a BPMN-style, cross-functional “swimlane” diagram showing how an order moves through four departments—Sales, Production, Procurement and Warehouse—from receipt all the way through shipping and invoicing. Here’s how it breaks down:

• Sales lane (top):  
  – Start: a timer event (“Monday morning”) kicks things off.  
  – “Check order for completeness” (task)  “Check if customer is already in the database” (task).  
  – Exclusive gateway: if the customer is new, a task “Add customer to the database” writes to a database (data object icon), then rejoins the “customer in database” path.  
  – Next task “Send order details” is a send-task that emits message flows (dashed arrows) into both Production and Procurement lanes.  
  – Finally, an intermediate message-catch event (“Product sent”) triggers the “Draft invoice” task, then the process ends (circle with thick border).  

• Production lane (second):  
  – Message-catch start event (“Order details arrive”) kicks off production planning.  
  – Task “Plan production” flows into an exclusive gateway.  
    • If materials are available (“Material not faulty” message from Procurement), it proceeds to “Manufacture product” (task).  
    • When manufacturing completes, an intermediate message-throw event (“Product complete”) fires, sending a dashed message into Warehouse.  

• Procurement lane (third):  
  – Message-catch start event (“Order details arrive”) begins procurement’s work.  
  – A collapsed subprocess labeled “Material Compensation Subprocess” contains two tasks—“Order materials” and, if needed, “Return material” (with a compensation marker)—to handle faulty deliveries.  
  – After the subprocess, task “Check materials” inspects incoming stock.  
    • If materials pass inspection, an intermediate message-throw event (“Material not faulty”) sends a dashed message back to Production’s gateway so manufacturing can proceed.  
    • If materials fail or cannot be corrected, the flow goes to an end event labeled “Order cancellation.”  

• Warehouse lane (bottom):  
  – Message-catch start event (“Product complete”) arrives from Production.  
  – Task “Send product” packages and ships to the customer.  
  – An intermediate message-throw event (“Product sent”) notifies Sales (dashed message) that shipping is done, and the warehouse flow ends.  

Visually, solid arrows are sequence flows within each lane; dashed arrows are message flows between lanes. Start events include a timer (Sales) and message events (all others), intermediate catch/throw message events coordinate hand-offs, and end events mark cancellation, shipment and invoicing completions. The subprocess in Procurement is marked to show compensation (the ability to “undo” an order if materials must be returned). Overall, the diagram captures a typical order-to-cash cycle, with customer-data validation, interdepartmental messaging, material-quality checks and final delivery plus invoicing.
