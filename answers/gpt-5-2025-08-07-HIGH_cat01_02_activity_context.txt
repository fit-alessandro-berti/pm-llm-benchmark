Here’s how the same activity names change meaning within a case, and how I’ve disambiguated them.

1) Recurring activities and their changing meanings
- Case C001
  - Verify Documents appears twice:
    - First: initial identity check right after request initiation.
    - Second: a re-check triggered by the customer’s subsequent document upload.
- Case C002
  - Call Customer appears twice:
    - First: to clarify an account discrepancy before any changes.
    - Second: to confirm the adjustments after they’ve been made.
- Case C003
  - Verify Documents appears twice:
    - First: initial, in-person verification at the branch.
    - Second: a re-verification after an internal account adjustment.

2) Renaming scheme (only recurring activities were disambiguated; a couple of singletons were made more explicit for clarity)
- Verify Documents (first in case) -> Verify Documents - Initial
- Verify Documents (after customer adds docs) -> Verify Documents - Recheck After Additional Docs
- Verify Documents (after internal adjustment) -> Verify Documents - Recheck After Account Adjustment
- Call Customer (before adjustment to clarify) -> Call Customer - Clarify Discrepancy (Pre-Adjustment)
- Call Customer (after adjustment to confirm) -> Call Customer - Confirm Adjustments (Post-Adjustment)
- Optional clarity applied consistently:
  - Call Customer (request missing docs) -> Call Customer - Request Missing Docs
  - Call Customer (ask to return to branch) -> Call Customer - Return to Branch
  - Submit Additional -> Submit Additional Documents

4) Justifications (contextual clues)
- “Verify Documents - Initial”: First verification step in each case; placement right after initiation and context mentions identity check/physical verification.
- “Verify Documents - Recheck After Additional Docs”: Occurs after “Submit Additional Documents”; agent explicitly re-checks with new material.
- “Verify Documents - Recheck After Account Adjustment”: Occurs after “Adjust Account”; context says “Re-verify docs after account adjustment.”
- “Call Customer - Clarify Discrepancy (Pre-Adjustment)”: Precedes “Adjust Account”; context says clarify discrepancy.
- “Call Customer - Confirm Adjustments (Post-Adjustment)”: Follows “Adjust Account”; context says confirm adjustments made.
- “Call Customer - Request Missing Docs”: Context says verification incomplete; call requests missing documents.
- “Call Customer - Return to Branch”: Context says customer stepped out; purpose is to have them return.
- “Submit Additional Documents”: Clarifies that the “additional” being submitted are documents (ID scan).
