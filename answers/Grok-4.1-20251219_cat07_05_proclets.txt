The provided visualization appears to be a set of diagrams from a scientific or academic context (likely related to software engineering, process modeling, or healthcare information systems). It illustrates concepts involving "proclets" — lightweight, interacting workflow processes used in flexible workflow management systems (a concept from research on artifact-centric or inter-organizational workflows).

The image is divided into three main parts: (a), (b), and (c). Here's a breakdown of each:

### (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels
This is a detailed **activity diagram** (or workflow diagram using rounded rectangles for actions, diamonds for decisions, and arrows for flow) showing the interaction between two proclet classes: **Lab visit** (on the left) and **Lab test** (on the right).

- **Lab visit** side (involving roles like doctor, lab assistant, and "Everything fine"):
  - Starts with "Order entry" by the doctor.
  - Lab assistant "Take blood sample".
  - Decision: "Judge results" (highlighted in green).
    - If not fine: "Do tests again" → "Send report" (highlighted in red) → loop back.
    - If fine: Proceed to end.
  - Interactions involve sending/receiving data via ports/channels (e.g., T7, T8, Q1, Q2, T9, T3).

- **Lab test** side (involving order system, HIS (Hospital Information System), chemical analyst):
  - Triggered by "Order system".
  - "Perform test" → "Make report".
  - Decision to "Finish lab test" or "Provide updated report".
  - Loops for re-testing if needed ("Receive updated result").

- **Connections**: The two proclets communicate asynchronously through **two channels** (dashed ovals labeled with ports like T7→T9, Q1→Q1, etc.), exchanging messages (e.g., test orders, results, reports). This shows how independent processes (proclets) collaborate without a central controller.

### (b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes
This is a simplified **UML-like class diagram** (rectangular boxes with relationships):
- **Lab visit** box on the left, connected to **Lab test** box on the right.
- Cardinalities:
  - One **Lab visit** requires 1..1 (exactly one) initial **Lab test**.
  - One **Lab visit** requires 1..* (one or more) additional **Lab tests** (likely for re-tests).
- This defines the structural relationship: A lab visit instance depends on one or more lab test instances.

### (c) Example of a performative
This is a **table** illustrating a single message (or "performative") in the communication between proclets:
- Columns: Time, Channel, Sender, Receivers, Action, Content, Scope, Direction.
- Example row (at 11:00):
  - Sender: Order system
  - Receivers: Lab test – HGB John (likely a specific lab test instance for patient John, measuring Hemoglobin)
  - Action: Create
  - Content: "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
  - Scope: Private
  - Direction: OUT (outgoing message)

Overall, the visualization demonstrates **proclet-based workflow modeling** in a medical lab scenario: how a patient's lab visit process interacts with separate lab test processes via message channels (performative communications), allowing flexibility for iterations (e.g., re-tests) while maintaining structured relationships. This is likely from research on distributed, artifact-centric business processes (e.g., papers by Wil van der Aalst or similar on proclets). The highlights (green/red) emphasize key decision and reporting points where loops occur.
