**Explanation:**

This problem requires us to infer sequences of patient journeys from a mixed series of hospital events. The provided dataset has a high degree of complexity with the events not explicitly attributing to a patient. 

To address this, we track an active case structure based on assuming unique sequences of 'Register patient', and concluding new patient cases based on the logical thread identified from recurring services such as "Surgery performed" which might accompany a follow-up of 'Recovery room' or 'Doctor consultation'. Broad events indicating completion like "Patient discharged" may also signify a new case setup for a new patient.

This problem's solution relies on this observation and assumption of implicit case partitioning based on such patterns. In a more complex scenario, a machine learning model may also be trained to detect such sequences' patterns for better inference.

The provided script attempts to ascertain and print grouping of events into 'cases' based on the assumptions made based on the sample dataset.
  
**Note:** We don't add the output key to every event as it's not a requirement of the problem but could be useful in real scenarios for forming a full picture of per-case events.
