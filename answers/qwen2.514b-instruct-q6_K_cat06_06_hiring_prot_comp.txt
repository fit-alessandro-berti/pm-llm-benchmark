To identify unfair differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group, we can compare various aspects like process frequencies, execution times, complexity (number of steps), and performance outcomes.

### Key Differences Identified:

1. **Process Complexity and Frequency:**
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of simpler processes with fewer steps, such as:
     - `Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge`
     - `Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge`
   - These are more frequently executed compared to similar but more complex processes in the unprotected group.
   
2. **Complex Processes with Longer Steps:**
   - The protected group shows a lower frequency of extremely detailed and complex processes that involve multiple examinations (e.g., Thorough Examination, Expert Examination), which often lead to higher performance times due to their complexity:
     - `Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge`
   - These are executed more frequently by the unprotected group.

3. **Discrepancy in Process Execution Times:**
   - The protected group experiences longer overall execution times for processes due to higher frequencies of treatment unsuccessful cycles, such as:
     - `Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Discharge`
     - `Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment (frequency = 51)`
   
4. **Frequency and Performance of Complex Processes:**
   - The unprotected group has a much higher frequency for complex processes that involve multiple examination stages, such as:
     - `Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge`
     - These are executed with similar performance times to less complex processes in the protected group.
   
5. **Outcome of Complex Processes:**
   - The unprotected group tends to have more instances where a patient's treatment is unsuccessful and requires further diagnosis and treatment cycles, leading to increased process complexity and execution time:
     - `Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge`
   
### Potential Implications:

- **Fairness in Access to Comprehensive Care:** 
  The protected group may not have the same level of access or be provided with the necessary detailed medical processes (like Thorough Examinations) that might lead to more effective treatments and fewer unsuccessful treatment cycles.
  
- **Quality of Treatment:**
  It appears there is a disparity where the protected group might receive less complex, potentially simpler and quicker but possibly less thorough care compared to the unprotected group.

### Conclusion:
The main differences lie in the complexity of processes executed and their frequency distribution between the two groups. The protected group often experiences more straightforward, direct treatments with fewer steps, whereas the unprotected group frequently undergoes more detailed examinations and diagnostic procedures, which are generally associated with longer but potentially more effective treatment cycles. This suggests that the protected group might receive less comprehensive care compared to the unprotected group, leading to potential disparities in healthcare outcomes.
