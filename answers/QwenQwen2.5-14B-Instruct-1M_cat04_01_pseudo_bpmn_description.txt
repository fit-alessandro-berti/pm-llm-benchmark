### Detailed Explanation of the Business Process

The pseudo-BPMN diagram outlines a structured business process for handling customer requests, distinguishing between standard and custom requests. Each step in the process is designed to ensure that customer requests are appropriately evaluated, approved, and fulfilled. Below is a detailed breakdown of each step, the purpose of each step, and how the process flows.

#### 1. **Start Event**
- **Purpose**: Initiates the process.
- **Action**: Triggers the BPMN workflow.

---

#### 2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose**: Captures the initial customer request.
- **Action**: Records the details of the customer request and identifies the type of request (standard or custom).

---

#### 3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**
- **Purpose**: Determines the type of request (Standard or Custom) to route the process accordingly.
- **Action**: Evaluates the type of request and branches the process into two distinct paths.

---

#### 3.1 **Path 1: Standard Request**
- **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
  - **Purpose**: Validates the standard request to ensure it meets basic criteria.
  - **Action**: Checks for completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the request.

- **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
  - **Purpose**: Initiates parallel checks to ensure the request can be processed.
  - **Action**: Splits the process into two parallel tasks that run concurrently.

    - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**
      - **Purpose**: Verifies the customer's creditworthiness.
      - **Action**: Checks if the customer meets the credit criteria.

    - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
      - **Purpose**: Ensures the availability of requested items.
      - **Action**: Checks if the required items are in stock or can be delivered within the expected timeframe.

- **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
  - **Purpose**: Reintegrates the results of the parallel checks.
  - **Action**: Combines the outcomes of the credit and inventory checks to proceed further.

- **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
  - **Purpose**: Determines the delivery date based on inventory availability and processing time.
  - **Action**: Calculates and sets the delivery date for the standard request.

---

#### 3.2 **Path 2: Custom Request**
- **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
  - **Purpose**: Evaluates whether the custom request is feasible.
  - **Action**: Analyzes the feasibility of the custom request, including technical and logistical challenges.

- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
  - **Purpose**: Determines whether the custom request can be fulfilled.
  - **Action**: Evaluates the feasibility analysis and branches the process based on the result.

    - **If Feasible (Yes)**
      - **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
        - **Purpose**: Creates a detailed quotation for the custom request.
        - **Action**: Prepares a quote that outlines the cost, timeline, and any special considerations for the custom request.

    - **If Not Feasible (No)**
      - **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
        - **Purpose**: Informs the customer that the custom request cannot be fulfilled.
        - **Action**: Sends a rejection notice with an explanation and any options for standard products.

- **End Event**
  - **Purpose**: Ends the process for non-feasible custom requests.

#### 4. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
- **Purpose**: Determines whether managerial approval is required for the next steps.
- **Action**: Evaluates the request and branches the process based on approval requirements.

    - **If Approval Needed (Yes)**
      - **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
        - **Purpose**: Seeks managerial approval to proceed with the next steps.
        - **Action**: Sends the request for approval to the manager.

      - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
        - **Purpose**: Evaluates the manager's approval decision.
        - **Action**: Branches the process based on the approval status.

          - **If Approval Granted (Yes)**
            - **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
              - **Purpose**: Creates the final invoice for the customer.
              - **Action**: Generates the invoice with all relevant details.

          - **If Approval Not Granted (No)**
            - **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
              - **Purpose**: Reassesses the request to find a solution.
              - **Action**: Re-evaluates the request to determine the next steps. Depending on the path (Standard or Custom), it loops back to either Task E1 (Custom Path) or Task D (Standard Path) for reevaluation and further processing.

    - **If No Approval Needed (No)**
      - **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
        - **Purpose**: Creates the final invoice for the customer.
        - **Action**: Generates the invoice with all relevant details.

---

#### 5. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- **Purpose**: Notifies the customer about the status of their request.
- **Action**: Sends a confirmation notice to the customer, which includes the final invoice or any other relevant details.

---

#### 6. **End Event**
- **Purpose**: Marks the completion of the process.
- **Action**: Finalizes the process and concludes the customer request handling.

### Summary of Key Points:
- **Standard Requests** follow a path of validation, parallel checks, and delivery date calculation, requiring approval only if necessary.
- **Custom Requests** undergo feasibility analysis, and if feasible, a quotation is prepared; if not, a rejection notice is sent.
- **Approval Steps**: Are triggered based on the complexity or value of the request, ensuring managerial oversight for higher-risk decisions.
- **Loopbacks**: Allow for reevaluation and reprocessing when necessary, ensuring the customer's needs are fully met.

This structured approach ensures that customer requests are handled efficiently, transparently, and in compliance with internal procedures and customer expectations.
