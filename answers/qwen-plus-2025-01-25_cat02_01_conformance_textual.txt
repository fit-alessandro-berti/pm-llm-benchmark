### Step 1: Analyze the Normative Process

The normative process outlines two main scenarios:
1. **Sufficient Inventory Path**: 
   - Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package  Ship  Close
   - Constraints:
     - "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory."
     - "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment."
     - "Ship order" must occur after "Package items."
     - "Close order" must be the final activity.

2. **Insufficient Inventory Path**:
   - Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close
   - Constraints:
     - "Cancel order" must occur after "Check inventory."
     - Activities like "Package items," "Authorize payment," or "Ship order" should not occur after "Cancel order."
     - "Close order" must be the final activity.

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Case in the Event Log

#### **Case 1**
Activities: Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package  Ship  Close  
- This follows the sufficient inventory path exactly as described.
- **No violations.**

#### **Case 2**
Activities: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize Payment  Ship  Close  
- Violation: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." According to the normative process, payment must be authorized before packaging can begin.
- **Violation Explanation**: The sequence deviates from the rule that "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment."

#### **Case 3**
Activities: Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Cancel  Ship  Close  
- Violations:
  1. After "Cancel order," the process includes "Ship order," which is explicitly forbidden in the insufficient inventory path.
  2. The cancellation scenario does not include "Close order" immediately after "Cancel order," but instead continues with an invalid activity ("Ship order").
- **Violation Explanation**: Once an order is canceled, no fulfillment activities (e.g., shipping) should occur. Additionally, "Close order" should follow directly after "Cancel order."

#### **Case 4**
Activities: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
- This follows the insufficient inventory path exactly as described.
- **No violations.**

#### **Case 5**
Activities: Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Ship  Close  
- Violation: "Ship order" occurs without a preceding "Package items." According to the normative process, items must be packaged before they can be shipped.
- **Violation Explanation**: The sequence skips the mandatory "Package items" step, violating the rule that "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items."

### Step 3: Summary of Violations

| Case ID | Violations                                                                 |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | None                                                                      |
| 2       | "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."                        |
| 3       | "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"; improper sequencing after cancel.|
| 4       | None                                                                      |
| 5       | "Ship order" occurs without preceding "Package items."                   |

### Final Answer:

The cases that violate the normative process are **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5**. Below are the specific violations for each:

1. **Case 2**: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
2. **Case 3**: "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," and the sequence after cancellation is incorrect.
3. **Case 5**: "Ship order" occurs without a preceding "Package items." 

Thus, the final answer is:  
**{Case 2, Case 3, Case 5}**
