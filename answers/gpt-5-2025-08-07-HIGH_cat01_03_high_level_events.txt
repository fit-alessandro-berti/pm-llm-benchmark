Proposed high-level activities (with rationale)
- Material Preparation
  - Why: All actions transform a raw sheet into a ready-to-weld workpiece. They are temporally contiguous and include identification (scan), positioning (place, align), and conditioning (preheat). Resources are preparatory (operator, robot, heating).
- Welding Assembly
  - Why: Tool pickup followed by weld actions form a coherent manual/assisted assembly phase producing the joint. Same operator and tightly clustered timestamps.
- In-line Weld Quality Verification
  - Why: Immediate post-weld sensor-based measurement(s) that validate the weld before any finishing; distinct resource type (quality sensor).
- Surface Finishing (Coating and Cure)
  - Why: Application and thermal drying are a single finishing phase, executed by coating/heating machines, temporally adjacent.
- Final Visual Inspection
  - Why: Human pass/fail check after finishing; distinct objective and resource (operator C), and it is terminal for the sample flow.

Generalizable grouping rules (anchor- and pattern-based)
- Step detection order per case (sorted by timestamp):
  1) Material Preparation
     - Entry trigger: first occurrence of any of [Retrieve raw metal sheet].
     - Include any of [Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet] occurring until the next assembly anchor appears.
     - Exit on the first of [Pick up welding tool, any activity matching “Weld …”, Measure …, Apply protective coating, Visual check], with preference to assembly if both assembly and QA appear.
  2) Welding Assembly
     - Entry trigger: [Pick up welding tool] or first “Weld …” if tool pickup is missing.
     - Include all “Weld …” and related tool operations until a QA/finishing anchor appears.
     - Exit on any of [Measure … (quality), Apply protective coating, Visual check].
  3) In-line Weld Quality Verification
     - Entry trigger: any “Measure …” by a Quality Sensor resource type.
     - Include consecutive sensor-based weld checks.
     - Exit when a non-QA finishing/inspection anchor follows.
  4) Surface Finishing (Coating and Cure)
     - Entry trigger: [Apply protective coating] or similar finishing action.
     - Include [Dry coating, Cure …, Bake …] until a new phase anchor (e.g., visual inspection) appears.
  5) Final Visual Inspection
     - Entry trigger: [Visual check] or similar human visual/QA activity.
     - Include subsequent visual checks for the same case if contiguous.
- Time adjacency heuristic: Use anchors first. If ambiguous, group activities within the same phase if inter-event gaps  3 minutes.
- Resource heuristics: Prefer grouping by step-specific resource types (e.g., robot/heating in preparation; operator B in welding; quality sensor in QA; coating/heating units in finishing; operator C in final inspection).
- Fallbacks: If an expected anchor is missing, infer the step using the first matching included activity. If activities appear out of order but belong to the same step and are within the adjacency window, keep them in that step.

How to apply this to the full log
- Partition events by CaseID, sort by timestamp.
- Walk the sequence once per case, emitting a new step when you hit an entry trigger; add subsequent events that match the step’s includedActivities until an exit trigger is encountered.
- Use the 3-minute adjacency rule only when anchors are ambiguous or missing.
- Capture step-level summaries (start, end, duration, main resources, key measurements like IntegrityScore and CoatingType).
- The resulting high-level trace per case should follow: Material Preparation  Welding Assembly  In-line Weld Quality Verification  Surface Finishing (Coating and Cure)  Final Visual Inspection.
