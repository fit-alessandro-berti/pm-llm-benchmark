Based on the provided flow data, I'll attempt to describe the underlying process. Please note that some assumptions might be made due to the complexity and potential ambiguities in the data.

**Process Name:** Employee Declaration and Payment Approval Process

**High-Level Overview:**

1. **Initiation**: An employee submits a declaration.
2. **Multi-Step Approval**: The declaration undergoes various approval stages involving different roles (Administration, Pre-Approver, Budget Owner, Supervisor).
3. **Outcome-Based Routing**: Depending on the outcome (Approved or Rejected) at each stage, the declaration is routed to the next appropriate step or back to the employee.
4. **Payment Processing**: Upon final approval, a payment request is initiated, which then gets handled.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Process:**

### Initiation

* **Start:** Declaration Submitted by Employee
	+ Possible initial states before submission are hinted at (e.g., "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE") but not fully detailed in the flow.

### Approval Process

1. **First Approval**
	* **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**  **Declaration APPROVED/REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**
		- **Approved**: Proceeds to either Budget Owner or Pre-Approver approval (parallel paths suggested by different frequencies and performances).
		- **Rejected**: Returns to Employee for resubmission.

2. **Intermediate Approvals (Parallel Paths)**
	* **To Budget Owner:**
		- **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**  **Declaration APPROVED/REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**
			- **Approved**: Proceeds to Supervisor for Final Approval.
			- **Rejected**: Returns to Employee.
	* **To Pre-Approver (and then directly to Supervisor):**
		- **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**  **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**  **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**

3. **Final Approval**
	* Various approved paths converge to **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
		- Also, some declarations bypass intermediate approvals and go directly from Employee to Supervisor for Final Approval (less frequent).

### Rejection Loops

* At multiple stages, if a declaration is **REJECTED**, it loops back to the **Employee** for resubmission, often with variations in performance metrics suggesting different handling times based on who rejected it (Administration, Pre-Approver, Budget Owner, Supervisor).

### Payment Process

1. **Request Payment**
	* Triggers after **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**.
2. **Payment Handled**
	* Direct outcome of Request Payment, with a notable performance metric suggesting this step takes significantly longer than others.

### Anomalies/Observations:

- **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING**: Infrequent and appears in two positions—after Final Approval (leading to Employee resubmission) and receiving from Payment Request (with no clear next step, potentially an error or unusual case).
- **FOR_APPROVAL States**: Rare transitions involving "FOR_APPROVAL" states by different roles suggest either a preparatory step before formal approval or an alternate, less frequently used pathway.
- **Direct Transitions**: Some direct transitions from Submission to Final Approval (or rejection at various stages back to the employee) indicate potential bypassing of intermediate steps based on unidentified criteria.

**Recommendations for Further Analysis:**

1. **Clarify MISSING Role/State**: Understand the context and handling of "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING".
2. **Uncover Criteria for Bypassing Intermediate Approvals**: Identify why some declarations skip certain approval stages.
3. **Investigate Performance Metrics**: Analyze reasons behind significant variations in performance (handling times) across different steps and transitions, potentially optimizing slower processes.
4. **Visualize with a BPMN Diagram**: Translate this textual description into a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram for clearer visualization and stakeholder communication.
