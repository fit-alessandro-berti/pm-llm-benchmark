Explanation of Added Constraints
Existence Constraints:

CheckSensitiveAttributes: Ensures that the process includes a step to check sensitive attributes.
ManualReview: Ensures that a manual review step is part of the process.
BiasMitigationCheck: Ensures that a bias mitigation check is included in the process.
Coexistence Constraints:

FinalDecision and ManualReview: Ensures that any final decision (Approve, Reject) coexists with a manual review to ensure fairness.
CheckSensitiveAttributes and BiasMitigationCheck: Ensures that any check of sensitive attributes is followed by a bias mitigation check.
Response Constraints:

CheckSensitiveAttributes and BiasMitigationCheck: Ensures that a bias mitigation check must follow any check of sensitive attributes.
BiasMitigationCheck and FinalDecision: Ensures that a final decision must follow a bias mitigation check.
Succession Constraints:

CheckSensitiveAttributes and BiasMitigationCheck: Ensures that a bias mitigation check directly follows any check of sensitive attributes.
BiasMitigationCheck and FinalDecision: Ensures that a final decision directly follows a bias mitigation check.
Non-succession Constraints:

CheckSensitiveAttributes and FinalDecision: Prevents a direct succession from a check of sensitive attributes to a final decision, ensuring that a bias mitigation check is always performed in between.
Rationale
Coexistence Constraints: By ensuring that FinalDecision coexists with ManualReview, we introduce a human oversight step that can help catch and correct any biased decisions. Similarly, by ensuring that CheckSensitiveAttributes coexists with BiasMitigationCheck, we ensure that any sensitive attribute checks are followed by a step to mitigate potential bias.
Response and Succession Constraints: These constraints ensure that any decision-making process involving sensitive attributes is preceded by a bias mitigation check, reducing the likelihood of immediate biased outcomes.
Non-succession Constraints: By preventing a direct succession from CheckSensitiveAttributes to FinalDecision, we ensure that there is always an intermediate step (bias mitigation check) to prevent immediate biased decisions.
These constraints collectively help in mitigating bias by ensuring that decisions are made only after proper checks and reviews, especially when sensitive attributes are involved. This approach promotes fairness and consistency in the loan application process.
