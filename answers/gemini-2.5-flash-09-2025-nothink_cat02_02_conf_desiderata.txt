## Analysis of Process Behavior Against Normative Rules and Desiderata

This analysis evaluates the provided event log against the two sets of constraints: the **Normative Constraints** (strict rules that must be followed) and the **Desiderata** (recommended best practices).

### 1. Analysis of Normative Rule Violations (Strict Constraints)

The normative rules define the mandatory sequence and conditional behavior (e.g., the flow if the loan is approved vs. rejected). Violations of these rules are considered severe process failures.

#### Case 1 Analysis
| Activity | Order | Normative Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Application Received | 1 | OK |
| Credit Check | 2 | OK (Precedes Risk Assessment) |
| Risk Assessment | 3 | OK |
| Loan Decision (Approved) | 4 | OK |
| Inform Applicant | 5 | OK (Follows Decision) |
| Finalize Documentation | 6 | OK (Required when Approved) |
| Close Case | 7 | OK (Follows Finalization) |

**Conclusion for Case 1:** **No Normative Violations.** This case followed the strict sequence required for an approved loan.

#### Case 2 Analysis
| Activity | Order | Normative Status | Violation Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Application Received | 1 | OK | |
| **Risk Assessment** | **2** | **VIOLATION** | **Normative Rule:** Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. Here, Risk Assessment occurred first. |
| Credit Check | 3 | OK | |
| Loan Decision (Rejected) | 4 | OK | |
| **Finalize Documentation** | **5** | **VIOLATION** | **Normative Rule:** If the loan is rejected, documentation must *not* be finalized before closing the case. |
| Close Case | 6 | OK | |

**Conclusion for Case 2:** **Severe Normative Violations.**
1. **Sequencing Error:** Risk Assessment was performed before the Credit Check.
2. **Conditional Error:** Final Documentation was performed after the loan was rejected.

#### Case 3 Analysis
| Activity | Order | Normative Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Application Received | 1 | OK |
| Credit Check | 2 | OK (Precedes Risk Assessment) |
| Risk Assessment | 3 | OK |
| Loan Decision (Approved) | 4 | OK |
| Inform Applicant | 5 | OK (Follows Decision) |
| Finalize Documentation | 6 | OK (Required when Approved) |
| Close Case | 7 | OK (Follows Finalization) |

**Conclusion for Case 3:** **No Normative Violations.** This case followed the strict sequence required for an approved loan, despite some timing issues (addressed below).

### Summary of Normative Violations

| Case ID | Normative Violations | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | None | Adherent |
| **2** | **Yes:** Sequencing error (Risk before Credit Check) and Conditional error (Finalizing documentation after rejection). | Severe Process Failure |
| **3** | None | Adherent |

### 2. Analysis of Desiderata Failures (Recommended Practices)

Desiderata relate to timing and preferred optional steps (Follow-up Call). Failure to meet these conditions represents suboptimal behavior but is not a process failure.

**Key Desiderata:**
1. Credit Check completed within 24 hours of Application Received.
2. Inform Applicant completed within 48 hours of Loan Decision.
3. Follow-up Call performed before Close Case (encouraged).

#### Case 1 Desiderata Analysis

| Event Pair | Start Time | End Time | Duration | Requirement | Desiderata Met? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| App Received  Credit Check | 09:00 | 09:30 | 30 min | < 24 hrs | **Met** |
| Decision  Inform Applicant | 11:00 | 13:00 | 2 hrs | < 48 hrs | **Met** |
| Follow-up Call | - | - | - | Performed? | Unknown/Not Recorded |

**Conclusion for Case 1:** All measurable timing desiderata were met.

#### Case 2 Desiderata Analysis

*Note: Since Case 2 violated normative rules, the timing is less relevant, but we evaluate it anyway.*

| Event Pair | Start Time | End Time | Duration | Requirement | Desiderata Met? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| App Received  Credit Check | 08:00 | 09:00 | 1 hr | < 24 hrs | **Met** |
| Decision  Inform Applicant | 09:30 | (Missing) | - | < 48 hrs | Cannot be assessed (Inform Applicant missing) |
| Follow-up Call | - | - | - | Performed? | Unknown/Not Recorded |

**Conclusion for Case 2:** The single measurable timing desideratum (Credit Check speed) was met.

#### Case 3 Desiderata Analysis

| Event Pair | Start Time | End Time | Duration | Requirement | Desiderata Met? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| App Received  Credit Check | 2024-01-12 09:00 | 2024-01-14 10:00 | **~49 hours** | < 24 hrs | **Failed** |
| Decision  Inform Applicant | 2024-01-14 12:00 | 2024-01-16 15:00 | **~51 hours** | < 48 hrs | **Failed** |
| Follow-up Call | - | - | - | Performed? | **Failed** (Text specifically notes "No Follow-up Call") |

**Conclusion for Case 3:** All timing and optional desiderata were failed, indicating suboptimal and slow execution, although the process flow itself was correct.

### Summary of Desiderata Failures (Suboptimal Behavior)

| Case ID | Credit Check Timing | Inform Applicant Timing | Follow-up Call Performed | Suboptimal Behavior? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Met | Met | Unknown | Low |
| **2** | Met | N/A | Unknown | Low (Timing was fast, despite process error) |
| **3** | **Failed** (>48h) | **Failed** (>51h) | **Failed** | High (Slow execution and skipped optional step) |

---

### 3. Interpretation and Justification

#### Case 1
This case represents **ideal process execution**. All strict rules were followed rapidly, and timing recommendations were met.

#### Case 2
This case demonstrates severe confusion or intentional circumvention of rules.
*   **Sequencing Error (Risk before Credit Check):** This might suggest human error, a systemic flaw where staff prioritize high-level assessment before necessary checks, or possibly a system override allowing pre-assessment based on preliminary data, which violates the strict rule requiring the formal Credit Check first.
*   **Conditional Error (Finalize Documentation after Rejection):** This is a critical violation. The justification is difficult, but it could imply staff confusion (mistakenly executing the 'approved' branch), malicious activity, or a system failure that allowed an invalid state transition.

#### Case 3
This case is **normatively compliant but highly inefficient/suboptimal**.
*   **Timing Failures:** The extended delays in performing the Credit Check (49 hours) and informing the applicant (51 hours) indicate significant bottlenecks, resource constraints, or low priority given to this application compared to the ideal service level.
*   **Skipping Follow-up Call:** This indicates a lack of commitment to thorough customer service or simply a cost-cutting/efficiency measure, sacrificing a recommended practice for speed (despite the case being slow overall).

**Justification:** Case 3 successfully completed the process but failed to meet service level agreements (SLAs) or best practice recommendations. The justification is that the process *worked*, but the organization responsible is not meeting its desired quality standards.
