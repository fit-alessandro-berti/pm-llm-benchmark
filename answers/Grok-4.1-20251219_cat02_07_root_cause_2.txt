### 1. Identification of Cases with Performance Issues

To identify cases with significantly longer durations, I calculated the total lead time for each case as the difference between the timestamp of the first event ("Submit Claim") and the last event ("Close Claim").

| Case ID | Complexity | Region | Start Timestamp       | End Timestamp         | Duration          | Notes |
|---------|------------|--------|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| 2001    | Low        | A      | 2024-04-01 09:00      | 2024-04-01 10:30       | 1 hour 30 minutes | Very fast, no document requests |
| 2004    | Low        | B      | 2024-04-01 09:20      | 2024-04-01 10:45       | 1 hour 25 minutes | Very fast, no document requests |
| 2002    | Medium     | B      | 2024-04-01 09:05      | 2024-04-02 11:00       | ~26 hours         | One document request, moderate delay |
| 2003    | High       | A      | 2024-04-01 09:10      | 2024-04-03 09:30       | ~48 hours         | Two document requests, significant delay |
| 2005    | High       | B      | 2024-04-01 09:25      | 2024-04-04 14:30       | ~77 hours         | Three document requests, longest duration |

**Cases with performance issues (significantly longer durations):**
- **Case 2005** (High complexity, Region B): Clearly the outlier at ~77 hours (over 3 days).
- **Case 2003** (High complexity, Region A): ~48 hours (2 days) – also notably longer than the others.
- The low-complexity cases (2001 and 2004) completed in under 2 hours, and the medium case (2002) took about 1 day.

### 2. Analysis of Attributes and Root Causes

#### By Complexity
- **Low complexity** (2001, 2004): Both completed same-day in ~1.5 hours. No "Request Additional Documents" events.
- **Medium complexity** (2002): One document request → delay to next day (~26 hours total).
- **High complexity** (2003, 2005): Multiple document requests (2 in 2003, 3 in 2005) → much longer durations.
  
**Clear correlation**: Higher complexity strongly correlates with more frequent "Request Additional Documents" activities, which introduce waiting time (likely for customer response) and extend the overall lead time.

#### By Region
- **Region A**:
  - Low (2001): ~1.5 hours
  - High (2003): ~48 hours
- **Region B**:
  - Low (2004): ~1.5 hours
  - Medium (2002): ~26 hours
  - High (2005): ~77 hours

Both regions handle low-complexity claims quickly. The longest case (2005) is in Region B, but the second-longest (2003) is in Region A. Region alone does not explain the variation—complexity appears to dominate. However, Region B's high-complexity case (2005) took longer than Region A's (2003), suggesting possible regional differences in handling efficiency.

#### By Resource (focusing on key roles)
- **Evaluation & Document Requests** (usually same adjuster):
  - Adjuster_Mike (Region A, cases 2001 low & 2003 high): 0 requests (low) vs. 2 requests (high).
  - Adjuster_Lisa (Region B, cases 2002 medium, 2004 low, 2005 high): 0 requests (low), 1 request (medium), 3 requests (high).
  
The same adjusters handle different complexity levels appropriately (more requests for higher complexity). The longest delays occur when Adjuster_Lisa handles high complexity (case 2005: three requests spread over several days).

- **Approval**:
  - Manager_Ann handles most faster cases.
  - Manager_Bill handles both high-complexity cases (2003 and 2005).

No strong evidence that specific individual resources are inherently slow; delays align more with complexity.

**Primary root cause**: **Claim complexity**. High-complexity claims require multiple rounds of requesting additional documents, each introducing significant waiting time (hours to days).

**Secondary contributing factor**: Possible regional or adjuster-specific differences in managing high-complexity claims. The worst-performing case (2005) combines high complexity with Region B and Adjuster_Lisa.

### 3. Explanations and Mitigation Suggestions

**Why complexity drives delays**:
- High-complexity claims likely involve more ambiguous or incomplete initial submissions, necessitating repeated information gathering from the customer.
- Each "Request Additional Documents" event creates a bottleneck: the process pauses until the claimant responds, and response times can vary widely (overnight or longer).

**Why Region B's high-complexity case was worst**:
- Potential differences in workload, customer demographics, or internal procedures in Region B could lead to slower resolution of document requests or longer customer response times.

**Suggestions to mitigate**:
1. **Proactive documentation for high-complexity claims**:
   - Flag claims as high-complexity early (e.g., based on claim type/amount) and provide claimants with comprehensive checklists at submission to reduce subsequent requests.

2. **Dedicated high-complexity handling**:
   - Create specialized teams or adjusters for high-complexity claims with expertise to minimize iterative requests.
   - Assign high-complexity cases to the best-performing resources (e.g., if data shows some adjusters resolve them faster).

3. **Improve customer communication**:
   - Implement automated reminders/SMS/email follow-ups after document requests to speed up claimant responses.
   - Offer guided upload portals or support hotlines for complex claims.

4. **Regional benchmarking and best-practice sharing**:
   - Compare document request frequency and resolution times between Region A and B for high-complexity claims.
   - Identify and replicate practices from the faster region (e.g., Region A's high case took ~48 hours vs. Region B's ~77 hours).

5. **Process monitoring**:
   - Set KPIs for cycle time by complexity level and alert managers when multiple document requests occur on the same case.

Implementing these targeted improvements, especially around upfront information collection and customer response acceleration, should significantly reduce lead times for high-complexity claims without affecting the already efficient low-complexity ones.
