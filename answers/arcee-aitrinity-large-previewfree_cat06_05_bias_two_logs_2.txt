Looking at these two logs, the key difference is the "+5 (Association Boost)" that appears in Group B. That's a direct, explicit adjustment based on whether someone belongs to a professional group, and it's applied at multiple stages—during the cultural fit check, in the final interview, and in the hiring decision.

This means two people with the same underlying qualifications can end up with different final scores just because one has a certain affiliation. For example, U003's cultural fit goes from 58 to 63 after the boost, enough to swing the outcome from "Not Hired" to "Hired," even though their raw scores are lower than P001's. That's a clear case where the decision isn't purely merit-based.

The bias here is favoritism toward those in the LocalBusinessLeadersClub, which can create unfair advantages for already-connected candidates and disadvantage equally or more qualified applicants who lack that membership. Over time, this can reinforce existing inequalities, reduce diversity, and undermine trust in the fairness of the hiring process.
