## Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

The temporal profile model reveals several unusual patterns:

*   **Receive to Approve (R to P):** The standard deviation of 1 hour is very small compared to the average time of approximately 25 hours. This suggests an unusually consistent timeframe for approval that may not reflect the natural variability of the process.
*   **Approve to Notify (P to N):** The average time of 7 days is exceptionally long for a notification following an approval. The high standard deviation of 2 days further indicates significant inconsistency in this step.
*   **Assign to Close (A to C):**  An average time of 2 hours to close a claim after assignment seems short, particularly without consistent intermediate steps like evaluation or approval being explicitly observed in the profile.
*   **Evaluate to Notify (E to N):** An average time of only 5 minutes between evaluation and notification appears unusually rapid, potentially indicating skipped steps or a lack of thoroughness in the evaluation process.

## Possible Reasons for Anomalies

Several factors could be contributing to these anomalies:

*   **Systemic Delays:** Manual processes or system limitations might be causing delays in certain steps, such as the prolonged time between approval and notification (P to N).
*   **Automated Processes Skipping Checks:**  Rapid transitions, like the short duration between evaluation and notification (E to N), might be due to automated processes that are bypassing necessary validation or review steps.
*   **Resource Bottlenecks:**  Inconsistent resource availability, such as a shortage of adjusters, could lead to variable waiting times, contributing to the high standard deviation seen in the P to N transition.
*   **Inconsistent Data Entry:**  Delays or errors in data entry could artificially inflate or deflate the time intervals between activities.
*   **Direct Closure of Simple Claims:** Claims that are straightforward or fall below a certain threshold might be fast-tracked, leading to quick closure times after assignment (A to C).
*   **Batch Processing:** Certain activities, especially notifications, might be processed in batches at fixed intervals, creating artificial clusters of activity and influencing the average times.

## Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

Here are some SQL queries to investigate these anomalies further:

**1. Identify Claims with Unusual Approval Times (R to P):**

```sql
WITH ReceiveApproveTimes AS (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS receive_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_time
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
    WHERE ce.activity IN ('R', 'P')
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2
)
SELECT
    rat.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (rat.approve_time - rat.receive_time)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM
    ReceiveApproveTimes rat
WHERE
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (rat.approve_time - rat.receive_time)) < (90000 - 3600) OR
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (rat.approve_time - rat.receive_time)) > (90000 + 3600)
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds DESC;
```

**2. Investigate Long Delays Between Approval and Notification (P to N):**

```sql
WITH ApproveNotifyTimes AS (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_time
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
    WHERE ce.activity IN ('P', 'N')
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2
)
SELECT
    ant.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ant.notify_time - ant.approve_time)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM
    ApproveNotifyTimes ant
WHERE
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ant.notify_time - ant.approve_time)) > (604800 + 2 * 172800)
ORDER BY
    time_diff_seconds DESC;
```

**3. Identify Claims Closed Quickly After Assignment (A to C):**

```sql
WITH AssignCloseTimes AS (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS assign_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS close_time
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
    WHERE ce.activity IN ('A', 'C')
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2
)
SELECT
    act.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (act.close_time - act.assign_time)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM
    AssignCloseTimes act
WHERE
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (act.close_time - act.assign_time)) < 7200
ORDER BY
    time_diff_seconds;
```

**4. Correlate Fast Evaluation-Notification with Claim Type (E to N):**

```sql
WITH EvalNotifyTimes AS (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        c.claim_type,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS eval_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_time
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
    WHERE ce.activity IN ('E', 'N')
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id, c.claim_type
    HAVING
        COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2
)
SELECT
    ent.claim_type,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ent.notify_time - ent.eval_time))) AS avg_time_diff_seconds
FROM
    EvalNotifyTimes ent
GROUP BY
    ent.claim_type
ORDER BY
    avg_time_diff_seconds;
```

**5. Check for Resource Bottlenecks in Approval-Notification (P to N):**

```sql
WITH ApproveNotifyTimes AS (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.resource END) AS approver
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
    WHERE ce.activity IN ('P', 'N')
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2
)
SELECT
    ant.approver,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ant.notify_time - ant.approve_time))) AS avg_time_diff_seconds
FROM
    ApproveNotifyTimes ant
GROUP BY
    ant.approver
ORDER BY
    avg_time_diff_seconds DESC;
```

These queries will help identify specific instances and patterns related to the observed anomalies, enabling a more targeted investigation into the root causes and potential solutions.
