Re-reading the three cases shows that only two activities ever repeat inside the SAME case:  

• Verify Documents  
• Call Customer  

Because their purpose shifts as the case evolves, the generic names hide those differences.  
Below is (1) the revised log with disambiguated activity names, followed by (2) short justifications.

-------------------------------------------------
2. Why each rename was chosen
-------------------------------------------------

Verify Documents  
• Initial Document Verification – first pass immediately after the customer’s request, always before any extra information or corrections exist.  
• Document Re-Verification after Additional Submission / after Account Adjustment – the second pass, triggered only because something changed (extra docs uploaded in C001; account data corrected in C003). The wording names the trigger so anyone can see *why* the verification is repeated.

Call Customer  
• Outbound Call – Request Missing Documents – purpose is to obtain outstanding paperwork (C001).  
• Outbound Call – Clarify Account Discrepancy – purpose is to gather information to correct records (C002, first call).  
• Outbound Call – Confirm Account Adjustment – purpose is to confirm that the earlier fix satisfied the customer (C002, second call).  
• Outbound Call – Recall Customer to Branch – purpose is to bring the walk-in customer back on-site (C003).

These renamed labels keep the original action (verification or call) at the front, then append a concise “why/when” phrase that differentiates each occurrence, making process mining or analysis far clearer without altering non-repeating activities.
