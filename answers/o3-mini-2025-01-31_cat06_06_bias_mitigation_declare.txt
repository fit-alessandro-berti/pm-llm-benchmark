Below is one valid updated version of the declare_model in which new biasmitigating constraints have been added. In this version we introduce the following measures:

1. Under coexistence we require that any decision made for a sensitive applicant (using, for example, activities “Approve_Minority” or “Reject_Minority”) must be accompanied with a “ManualReview” in the trace. This is intended to ensure that a human “check” is performed when sensitive demographic information is involved.  
2. Under response we add a constraint for the sensitive attribute event “CheckApplicantRace” so that whenever this event occurs a “BiasMitigationCheck” must eventually occur. This helps guarantee an intermediate verification step before any decision can be made based on the sensitive information.  
3. Under nonsuccession we prevent a direct succession from the sensitive attribute event “CheckApplicantRace” to decision events “Approve” or “Reject”. This rule avoids immediate decisions after observing sensitive attributes, reducing the risk of biased immediate outcomes.

The updated dictionary is shown below:

Explanation of Additions:

• In coexistence, adding rules for “Approve_Minority” and “Reject_Minority” to coexist with “ManualReview” ensures that if a decision concerning a sensitive demographic is made, it is always accompanied by a manual, human review. This is a safeguard against purely automated biased decisions.

• In response, introducing a rule that after “CheckApplicantRace” the process must eventually perform a “BiasMitigationCheck” enforces an additional verification step before any consequential decision follows. This check helps to reduce the potential for unmitigated bias triggered by sensitive information.

• In nonsuccession, prohibiting an immediate transition from “CheckApplicantRace” to critical decision activities (“Approve” and “Reject”) prevents the process from making a snap decision directly after processing sensitive attributes—thus further reducing bias risks.

Together, these constraints promote fairness by ensuring that decisions which might be influenced by sensitive applicant attributes are subject to intermediate checks and human review, guarding against disproportionate or prejudicial outcomes in the loan application process.
