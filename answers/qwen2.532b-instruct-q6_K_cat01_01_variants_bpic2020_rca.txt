To identify the root causes of performance issues within your process, we need to focus on specific parts of the process where delays or inefficiencies may occur based on the provided data. Here are some key observations:

1. **High Rejection Rates by Key Decision Makers**:
   - Processes that involve rejections by ADMINISTRATION (frequencies: 36, 29, 18, 5) and SUPERVISOR (frequencies: 77, 49, 22, 10, 6) often result in higher performance times. This indicates delays due to repeated submissions and approvals after rejections.
   - High rejection rates at these stages suggest that there might be unclear criteria for approval or insufficient initial validation of declarations by the EMPLOYEE.

2. **Multiple Approvals**:
   - Processes with multiple approval steps, such as involving both ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER (frequencies: 188, 49, 20), tend to have higher performance times compared to those that only involve one or two approvals.
   - This suggests that each additional step in the process increases the overall time taken. Each approval step introduces potential delays, especially if there are back-and-forth communications for clarifications.

3. **Specific Process Variants with High Performance Times**:
   - Some specific variants have notably high performance times, such as the one where ADMINISTRATION rejection is followed by multiple submissions and approvals (frequency 575), or the process involving PRE_APPROVER and SUPERVISOR after initial rejections (frequency 8).
   - The variant `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER` also shows higher performance times, indicating that budget approval is a significant bottleneck.

4. **Incomplete Declarations**:
   - Variants where the declaration process stops before reaching payment handled (e.g., frequency = 134 for SAVED by EMPLOYEE, or frequencies involving rejections without further action) indicate issues with incomplete submission processes.
   - These could be due to missing information in declarations leading to frequent rework and delays.

5. **Complex Rejection Paths**:
   - Variants like `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Multiple Submissions` (frequencies: 36, 29) suggest that complex rejection paths are causing significant delays.
   - This could be due to unclear guidelines or lack of automated feedback mechanisms to guide the employee in resubmitting correctly.

Based on these observations, the root causes for performance issues can be summarized as:
- **Unclear Approval Criteria**: Leading to multiple rejections and resubmissions.
- **Excessive Approval Steps**: Increasing the overall time taken due to each step's delays and potential back-and-forth communications.
- **Inefficient Rejection Handling**: Resulting in complex paths that need to be streamlined for clarity and efficiency.

Addressing these specific areas could significantly improve process performance.
