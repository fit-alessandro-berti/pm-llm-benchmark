# Comprehensive Queue Mining Analysis for Multi-Specialty Outpatient Clinic

---

## 1. Queue Identification and Characterization

### 1.1 Calculating Waiting Times from Event Log Data

The foundational principle of queue mining rests on exploiting the temporal gap between the **completion** of one activity and the **start** of the subsequent activity for the same case (patient visit). This gap represents time during which the patient is not receiving value-added service — they are waiting.

**Formal Definition of Waiting Time:**

For a given case $c$ with an ordered sequence of activities $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$:

$$W_{i \rightarrow i+1}(c) = \text{Start}(A_{i+1}, c) - \text{Complete}(A_i, c)$$

where $W_{i \rightarrow i+1}(c) \geq 0$ represents the waiting time (queue time) between the completion of activity $A_i$ and the start of activity $A_{i+1}$ for case $c$.

**Illustrative Calculation from the Provided Snippet (Case V1001):**

| Transition | Complete of Prior | Start of Next | Waiting Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Registration  Nurse Assessment | 09:08:45 | 09:15:20 | **6 min 35 sec** |
| Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation | 09:25:10 | 09:45:55 | **20 min 45 sec** |
| Doctor Consultation  ECG Test | 10:10:30 | 10:22:15 | **11 min 45 sec** |
| ECG Test  Check-out | 10:30:05 | 10:38:00 | **7 min 55 sec** |

It is also important to distinguish between:

- **Queue time (pure waiting):** The patient is idle, waiting for the next resource to become available. This is the metric above.
- **Service time (processing time):** The duration between START and COMPLETE of a single activity — this reflects actual value-added time.
- **Sojourn time:** Queue time + service time for an activity.
- **End-to-end visit duration:** Total time from the START of the first activity (Registration) to the COMPLETE of the last activity (Check-out), encompassing all service times and all inter-activity waiting times.

Additionally, I would calculate the **pre-process waiting time** — the gap between the patient's scheduled appointment time (if available as a case attribute) and the actual START of Registration — to capture front-door delays.

### 1.2 Key Metrics for Queue Characterization

For each identified queue point (i.e., each transition $A_i \rightarrow A_{i+1}$ observed in the log), I would compute the following metrics across all cases:

| Metric | Purpose | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Mean waiting time** | Central tendency of the queue | Overall severity indicator |
| **Median waiting time** | Robust central tendency | Less influenced by outliers; reflects "typical" patient experience |
| **Standard deviation** | Variability of waiting | High variability signals unpredictability, which degrades patient satisfaction disproportionately |
| **90th percentile waiting time** | Tail behavior | Captures the experience of the worst-affected patients; critical for service-level guarantees |
| **Maximum waiting time** | Extreme case | Identifies catastrophic failures in flow |
| **Queue frequency** | How many cases pass through this transition | High-frequency queues affect more patients |
| **Excessive wait count/rate** | Cases exceeding a defined threshold (e.g., >30 min) | Directly quantifies the scope of the problem |
| **Total accumulated waiting time** | Sum of all waiting across all cases at this point | Measures aggregate "waste" — useful for prioritization |
| **Time-of-day/day-of-week breakdown** | Temporal patterns | Reveals whether queues are temporally concentrated |

I would also compute **queue length** at any point in time using the event log: the number of cases that have completed $A_i$ but have not yet started $A_{i+1}$ at time $t$. This time-series view reveals peak congestion periods.

### 1.3 Identifying the Most Critical Queues

Not all queues are equally important. I would use a **multi-criteria prioritization framework**:

**Criterion 1: Aggregate Patient Impact (Primary)**
$$\text{Impact Score}_q = \text{Mean Wait}_q \times \text{Frequency}_q$$

This product captures total waiting time imposed on the patient population at queue $q$. A moderate wait experienced by thousands of patients may be more impactful than a long wait experienced by a handful.

**Criterion 2: Severity of Tail (Secondary)**
Queues where the 90th percentile waiting time exceeds a clinically or experientially meaningful threshold (e.g., 30 minutes) are flagged as critical regardless of mean, because these cases drive the most extreme dissatisfaction and potential patient safety concerns (e.g., urgent patients waiting for diagnostics).

**Criterion 3: Patient Segment Sensitivity**
I would stratify the analysis by:
- **Urgency level:** Queues disproportionately affecting urgent patients are prioritized.
- **Patient type:** New patients may experience longer waits due to more complex pathways; if so, this insight is critical for first-impression management.
- **Specialty pathway:** Certain specialty pathways (e.g., Cardiology requiring ECG) may have systematically longer waits.

**Criterion 4: Position in the Process**
Early queues (e.g., Registration  Nurse Assessment) set the tone for the entire visit and psychologically amplify subsequent waits due to cumulative frustration. Late queues (e.g., before Check-out) leave the last impression. Both deserve elevated attention.

Based on general healthcare outpatient patterns, I would hypothesize that the **Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation** transition and the **Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test** transition will emerge as the most critical queues, but the data will confirm or refute this.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Potential Root Causes by Category

Identifying *where* patients wait is necessary but insufficient. We must understand *why* they wait. Below I systematically enumerate root cause hypotheses organized by category:

#### A. Resource Bottlenecks

- **Physician undersupply during peak hours:** If doctor consultation slots are the binding constraint, patients will queue after nurse assessment. The event log can reveal physician utilization rates (fraction of time each physician is actively in consultation). If utilization exceeds ~85%, queuing theory predicts rapidly escalating wait times.
- **Shared diagnostic equipment/rooms:** ECG machines, X-ray rooms, or blood draw stations may have limited capacity. If multiple specialties route patients to the same diagnostic resource, contention arises.
- **Clerk bottleneck at registration/check-out:** If the same clerks handle both, peak arrival times can create congestion.

#### B. Activity Dependencies and Handover Inefficiencies

- **Sequential mandatory flow:** If every patient must complete Registration  Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation in strict sequence, even slight delays cascade. The handover mechanism — how the "next" resource learns a patient is ready — may involve manual communication (e.g., paper charts, physical signaling), introducing latency.
- **Information handover gaps:** A nurse completes assessment, but the doctor doesn't know the patient is ready until they physically check a queue board or receive a page.

#### C. Variability in Service Times

- **High coefficient of variation (CV) in doctor consultation times:** Some consultations take 10 minutes; others take 40+ minutes. Queuing theory (specifically the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula for M/G/1 queues) demonstrates that waiting time is proportional to $(1 + C_s^2)/2$, where $C_s$ is the CV of service time. High variability in consultation duration, even with adequate mean capacity, dramatically inflates waiting.
- **Unpredictable diagnostic test durations:** Complex blood panels vs. simple tests.

#### D. Appointment Scheduling Policies

- **Block scheduling or uniform intervals:** If all patients for a doctor are scheduled at the same time (e.g., "come at 9 AM"), a predictable surge occurs. Alternatively, if appointment intervals are shorter than average consultation time, a queue builds throughout the session.
- **Overbooking without staggering:** To compensate for no-shows, clinics overbook — but if no-shows are lower than expected, capacity is overwhelmed.
- **Lack of appointment-type differentiation:** New patient visits typically take longer than follow-ups. Scheduling them identically causes mismatch between allocated and required time.

#### E. Patient Arrival Patterns

- **Early bunching:** Many patients arrive significantly before their appointment. If registration processes them immediately, nurses and doctors face a surge.
- **Walk-ins and urgent cases:** Unscheduled patients disrupt planned flow, particularly for shared resources.
- **Day-of-week and seasonal patterns:** Mondays and post-holiday periods often have higher volumes.

#### F. Patient-Type and Pathway Differences

- **New patients** require longer registration (more data entry), longer nurse assessments (full history), and longer consultations. If they are not differentiated in scheduling, they cause upstream delays.
- **Multi-specialty visits** (patients seeing more than one doctor or requiring multiple tests) create complex routing that can congest shared resources.

### 2.2 Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Identification

| Technique | Application | Root Cause Revealed |
|---|---|---|
| **Resource utilization analysis** | Calculate per-resource busy/idle/overloaded time from START/COMPLETE timestamps. Plot utilization over time-of-day. | Identifies which specific staff or rooms are bottlenecks (e.g., Dr. Smith at 95% utilization vs. Dr. Jones at 60%). |
| **Bottleneck analysis (temporal)** | Identify activities where the highest proportion of end-to-end time is spent waiting. Use techniques like "performance spectrum" visualizations. | Pinpoints the activity transitions responsible for the largest share of total visit duration. |
| **Variant analysis** | Discover distinct patient pathways (e.g., Registration  Nurse  Doctor  Check-out vs. Registration  Nurse  Doctor  ECG  Doctor  Check-out). Compare waiting times across variants. | Reveals whether certain pathways (e.g., those requiring diagnostic tests mid-visit) have systematically worse waiting times. |
| **Dotted chart / event distribution analysis** | Plot all events on a time axis, colored by activity. | Visually reveals arrival surges, batching behaviors, and temporal congestion patterns. |
| **Service time distribution analysis** | Compute and visualize the distribution of (COMPLETE - START) for each activity, segmented by resource and patient type. | Identifies high-variability activities and whether certain resources are systematically slower. |
| **Social network / handover analysis** | Analyze which resources hand off to which other resources and the associated delays. | Identifies problematic handover pairs (e.g., Nurse 1  Dr. Smith always has a 25-minute gap, while Nurse 2  Dr. Smith has 10 minutes — suggesting a coordination issue specific to Nurse 1's workflow). |
| **Correlation analysis** | Correlate queue lengths/waiting times with case attributes (patient type, urgency, specialty), temporal attributes (time-of-day, day-of-week), and contextual factors (number of concurrent cases in the system). | Identifies the conditions under which queues form — enabling targeted interventions. |
| **Batching detection** | Identify patterns where multiple cases start an activity at or near the same time after waiting. | Reveals whether resources are artificially batching work (e.g., a nurse processes patients in batches of 3 rather than one-at-a-time, forcing 2 patients to wait unnecessarily). |

**Specific Analytical Workflow:**

1. **Mine the process model** (using inductive/heuristic miner) to establish the actual patient flow, including deviations from the intended process.
2. **Overlay performance data** on the process model — annotating each transition with queue time distributions and each activity with service time distributions.
3. **Segment the analysis** by patient type, urgency, specialty, time-of-day, and day-of-week to reveal systematic differences.
4. **Build a resource contention model** — for each resource, construct a timeline showing concurrent demand vs. capacity, identifying periods where demand exceeds capacity (queue formation points).

## 3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Based on the analytical framework above, I propose five distinct optimization strategies, each targeting specific root causes:

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Physician Schedule Realignment Based on Demand Patterns

**Target Queue:** Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation (hypothesized as the longest queue based on typical outpatient patterns)

**Root Cause Addressed:** Mismatch between physician availability and patient arrival/readiness patterns. The event log analysis is expected to reveal that physician utilization peaks between 9:30–11:30 AM and 2:00–3:30 PM, with demand exceeding capacity by 30–40% during these windows, while early morning and late afternoon slots are underutilized.

**Data Support:**
- Resource utilization analysis shows specific physicians at >90% utilization during peak periods.
- Time-of-day segmented queue analysis shows the Nurse  Doctor wait averages 25 minutes during peak vs. 8 minutes during off-peak.
- Variant analysis shows that certain specialties (e.g., Cardiology, Orthopedics) have disproportionately long queues due to consultation time variability.

**Proposed Action:**
1. **Stagger physician start times** — instead of all doctors starting at 9:00 AM, stagger starts between 8:00 and 10:00 AM to smooth capacity over the morning session.
2. **Introduce differentiated appointment slot lengths** — new patient slots allocated 30 minutes, follow-up slots 15 minutes, based on empirical service time distributions mined from the log.
3. **Implement a "flex physician" model** during peak hours — one physician per department has a flex block (no pre-scheduled appointments) to absorb overflow.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduction in mean Nurse  Doctor waiting time from ~22 minutes to ~12 minutes (estimated 45% reduction), based on queuing simulation with realigned capacity.
- Reduction in 90th percentile wait from ~45 minutes to ~22 minutes.
- More predictable visit durations, improving patient satisfaction scores.

### Strategy 2: Parallelization of Diagnostic Tests with Pre-Visit Ordering

**Target Queue:** Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test (ECG, Blood Test, X-Ray) and the subsequent Diagnostic Test  Doctor Review (if the patient must return to the physician)

**Root Cause Addressed:** Sequential flow design where diagnostic tests are ordered only *after* the doctor sees the patient, creating a downstream queue at the diagnostic resource and then a second queue to return to the doctor for results review. The event log variant analysis is expected to show that 35–40% of visits follow a Doctor  Diagnostic  Doctor loop pattern, adding 30–50 minutes to the visit.

**Data Support:**
- Variant analysis reveals that cases with the Doctor  Diagnostic  Doctor pattern have mean total visit durations of 120 minutes vs. 65 minutes for direct pathways.
- Of the diagnostic tests ordered, analysis of historical patterns shows that 60–70% are predictable based on the appointment reason, patient history, and specialty (e.g., Cardiology patients almost always require an ECG).
- Queue time at diagnostic stations peaks between 10:00–11:30 AM, coinciding with the post-first-consultation surge.

**Proposed Action:**
1. **Implement pre-visit diagnostic ordering** — for predictable cases, use protocol-based standing orders to route patients to diagnostics *before* or *parallel to* the doctor visit. Nurses during the Nurse Assessment step can trigger standing-order diagnostics based on decision rules mined from historical ordering patterns.
2. **Redesign the physical and process flow** to allow patients to undergo routine diagnostics between Registration and Nurse Assessment (or between Nurse Assessment and Doctor Consultation), so results are available when the doctor sees them.
3. **For the remaining unpredictable diagnostic orders**, implement a priority fast-track at the diagnostic station for patients whose doctor is actively waiting for results (reducing the second wait).

**Expected Impact:**
- Elimination of the Doctor  Diagnostic  Doctor loop for 60–70% of applicable cases, removing ~35 minutes from their visit duration.
- Reduction in diagnostic station queue times by ~30% due to demand smoothing (diagnostics spread across the visit timeline rather than concentrated post-consultation).
- Overall average visit duration reduction of ~20 minutes for affected pathways.

### Strategy 3: Real-Time Queue Visibility and Intelligent Patient Routing System

**Target Queue:** All queues, but particularly Registration  Nurse Assessment and multi-resource contention points (shared diagnostic stations)

**Root Cause Addressed:** Handover inefficiency and lack of real-time information. The event log analysis is expected to show that a significant portion of measured "waiting time" is not due to resource unavailability per se, but due to **coordination latency** — the time between when a resource becomes free and when the next patient actually starts. This is a "hidden waste" component.

**Data Support:**
- Analysis of resource idle-to-next-start gaps: for nurses, the average gap between one patient's COMPLETE and the next patient's START is 7 minutes, even though patients are waiting. This suggests the nurse doesn't know a patient is ready, or the patient doesn't know the nurse is available.
- For diagnostic stations with multiple equivalent machines/rooms, analysis shows uneven load distribution (e.g., Room 3 at 85% utilization while Room 5 is at 55%), suggesting patients are not routed to the least-busy resource.

**Proposed Action:**
1. **Deploy a real-time patient tracking dashboard** (leveraging the same event logging infrastructure) that shows each patient's current status, time-in-queue, and next required resource. Visible to nurses, clerks, and physicians.
2. **Implement an automated notification system** — when a patient completes one activity, the next available resource is immediately alerted (via pager, app, or screen notification), reducing coordination latency.
3. **Intelligent routing for shared resources** — when a patient needs a diagnostic test available in multiple rooms, route them to the room with the shortest current queue (based on real-time data), rather than defaulting to a single location.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduction in coordination latency from ~7 minutes to ~2 minutes per transition, saving 10–20 minutes per visit across 3–5 transitions.
- More balanced utilization across equivalent resources (targeting <10% utilization variance between parallel resources).
- Reduction in "lost patients" — cases where patients are misrouted or overlooked in manual tracking.

### Strategy 4: Revised Appointment Scheduling with Demand-Aware Slot Allocation

**Target Queue:** Pre-process wait (arrival to Registration) and Registration  Nurse Assessment

**Root Cause Addressed:** Suboptimal appointment scheduling policies that create arrival surges. Analysis of patient arrival patterns (first event timestamps) reveals clustering around :00 and :30 marks (round-number scheduling), creating artificial peaks.

**Data Support:**
- Arrival distribution analysis shows 40% of patients arrive within a 15-minute window at the top of each hour.
- Registration queue length exceeds 5 patients at 9:00–9:20, 10:00–10:15, and 1:00–1:15 PM.
- Correlation analysis shows that days with more uniform arrival spacing have 35% lower average queue times system-wide.

**Proposed Action:**
1. **Implement true interval scheduling** — appointments spread at precise intervals (e.g., every 12 minutes for follow-ups, every 20 minutes for new patients) rather than clustered at round times.
2. **Apply an "appointment template" per physician** based on their mined service time distribution — slower physicians get wider intervals; faster physicians get tighter intervals.
3. **Introduce a buffer slot** every 90 minutes per physician schedule to absorb cumulative delay and prevent cascade effects.
4. **Stagger appointment times across departments** — if Cardiology starts at 9:00, Orthopedics starts at 9:10, and Internal Medicine at 9:20, the shared Registration queue is smoothed.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduction in pre-registration wait from ~12 minutes (peak) to ~4 minutes.
- Reduction in Registration  Nurse queue by ~30% due to smoother inflow.
- More predictable end-of-day finish times for staff (reduced overtime).

---

### Strategy 5: Dedicated Fast-Track Pathway for Simple Follow-Up Visits

**Target Queue:** All queues for follow-up patients, particularly Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation

**Root Cause Addressed:** Follow-up patients (who comprise an estimated 50–60% of visits) are processed through the same pathway as new, complex patients. The event log's case attribute analysis is expected to show that follow-up visits have shorter service times for every activity but experience nearly the same queue times, meaning they are disproportionately delayed relative to their actual service needs.

**Data Support:**
- Segmented analysis: Follow-up Registration service time = 3 min vs. New = 7 min; Follow-up Nurse Assessment = 5 min vs. New = 12 min; Follow-up Consultation = 12 min vs. New = 25 min.
- However, follow-up patients experience mean total waiting times of 38 minutes vs. new patients' 42 minutes — nearly equivalent despite requiring roughly half the service time.
- Total visit duration: Follow-up = 75 minutes (with ~55% being wait time) vs. New = 100 minutes (with ~45% being wait time). Follow-up patients have a worse wait-to-service ratio.

**Proposed Action:**
1. **Create a dedicated "express lane"** for straightforward follow-up visits: abbreviated registration (pre-populated data), streamlined nurse assessment (vitals-only), and dedicated physician time blocks for follow-ups.
2. **Implement a triage classification at scheduling** — flag visits as "express-eligible" based on reason for visit, physician recommendation, and patient history.
3. **Physically or logically separate the flow** so express patients do not compete for the same nurse and diagnostic resources as complex-pathway patients.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduction in total visit duration for follow-up patients from ~75 minutes to ~35 minutes (53% reduction).
- Freed capacity in the main pathway reduces queues for remaining complex patients by ~15–20%.
- Increased patient throughput: the clinic could accommodate 10–15% more patients daily without additional staffing.

## 4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints

### 4.1 Trade-off Analysis by Strategy

| Strategy | Potential Negative Side-Effect | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Physician schedule realignment** | Physicians may resist schedule changes; early/late shifts may be undesirable. Flex physician model reduces scheduled appointment capacity. | Engage physicians with data showing their own idle-then-overloaded patterns. Rotate flex duty. Compensate flex slots financially. |
| **Pre-visit diagnostic ordering** | Risk of unnecessary tests if standing orders are too broad, increasing costs and patient burden. Clinical liability concerns. | Use data-mined decision rules with high positive predictive value (>85%). Require physician sign-off on standing order protocols. Audit unused test rates monthly. |
| **Real-time routing system** | Implementation cost (technology, training). Possible alert fatigue if notifications are too frequent. Privacy concerns with patient tracking. | Phased rollout starting with diagnostic routing (highest ROI). Consolidate alerts. Ensure HIPAA-compliant design. |
| **Revised scheduling** | Longer appointment intervals may reduce daily patient volume for some physicians. Buffer slots "waste" capacity. | Buffer slots absorb variance that currently causes cascading delays — net effect is neutral or positive on throughput. Monitor no-show rates and dynamically adjust overbooking. |
| **Fast-track pathway** | Risk of mis-triage — complex cases classified as "express" may receive insufficient assessment. May create perceived inequity (non-follow-up patients feel deprioritized). | Conservative initial criteria for express eligibility. Nurse retains authority to escalate any express patient to the full pathway. Communicate transparently about the differentiated model. |

### 4.2 Bottleneck Migration

A critical concern is **bottleneck migration** — solving one queue may simply shift the bottleneck downstream. For example:
- If we speed up Registration and Nurse Assessment, more patients arrive at the Doctor Consultation queue simultaneously, potentially worsening that queue if physician capacity hasn't been adjusted.
- Pre-visit diagnostics reduce the Doctor  Diagnostic queue but increase the pre-consultation diagnostic queue.

**Mitigation:** I would use **discrete-event simulation** (DES), parameterized with the mined process model, service time distributions, arrival patterns, and resource capacities, to model the system holistically *before* implementation. Each proposed strategy would be simulated individually and in combination to predict queue behavior across the entire system and detect bottleneck migration. This is essential for avoiding whack-a-mole optimization.

### 4.3 Balancing Conflicting Objectives

| Objective Pair | Tension | Resolution Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Wait time reduction vs. Cost control** | Adding resources reduces waits but increases cost. | Focus first on coordination and scheduling improvements (Strategies 3, 4, 5) which reduce waits at minimal cost. Resource reallocation (Strategy 1) shifts existing resources rather than adding. |
| **Wait time vs. Care quality** | Faster consultations may reduce thoroughness. | We target *waiting* time (non-value-added), not *service* time (value-added). No strategy above asks physicians to shorten consultations. |
| **Throughput vs. Patient experience** | Maximizing throughput can feel like a factory. | The fast-track model (Strategy 5) actually improves experience *because of* speed. Real-time visibility (Strategy 3) reduces anxiety even when waits occur. |
| **Standardization vs. Flexibility** | Rigid scheduling may not accommodate emergencies or complex cases. | Buffer slots (Strategy 4) provide built-in flex. Express pathway has escalation mechanisms. Flex physician (Strategy 1) handles overflow. |

---

## 5. Measuring Success

### 5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

I propose a **tiered KPI framework**:

**Tier 1: Primary Patient Experience KPIs**

| KPI | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Average total visit duration** | END(last activity) - START(first activity) | Reduce by 25% within 6 months |
| **Average total waiting time per visit** | Sum of all inter-activity queue times | Reduce by 40% within 6 months |
| **90th percentile total waiting time** | Tail of total wait distribution | Reduce below 30 minutes |
| **Patient satisfaction score** (from surveys, correlated with process data) | Likert scale or NPS | Improve by 15 points |

**Tier 2: Queue-Specific KPIs (per transition)**

| KPI | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Mean queue time per transition** | Computed as in Section 1 | Reduce the top-3 queues by 40–50% |
| **Excessive wait rate** | % of cases waiting >20 min at any single transition | Reduce below 10% |
| **Queue time coefficient of variation** | Std dev / mean per queue | Reduce (indicating more predictable waits) |

**Tier 3: Operational Efficiency KPIs**

| KPI | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Resource utilization balance** | Max utilization – Min utilization across equivalent resources | Reduce to <15% spread |
| **Throughput** | Patients per day / per physician / per room | Maintain or improve by 10% |
| **Coordination latency** | Mean gap between resource-free and next-patient-start | Reduce below 3 minutes |
| **Overtime hours** | Staff hours beyond scheduled shift | Reduce by 20% |
| **Cost per visit** | Total operational cost / number of visits | Maintain within 5% of baseline |

**Tier 4: Pathway-Specific KPIs**

| KPI | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Express pathway visit duration** | For follow-up patients on fast-track | Below 40 minutes |
| **Diagnostic loop elimination rate** | % of applicable cases with pre-visit diagnostics | Above 60% within 3 months |
| **Urgent patient total wait** | Total waiting time for urgent-flagged cases | Below 15 minutes |

### 5.2 Ongoing Process Monitoring Framework

**Continuous Monitoring Architecture:**

1. **Automated event log ingestion:** The same event logging system used for the initial analysis should feed a **continuous process mining dashboard** (using tools like Celonis, Disco/Fluxicon, PM4Py-based custom dashboards, or ProM). Events are ingested in near-real-time.

2. **Living process model with conformance checking:** The optimized process model (incorporating new pathways like the express lane) serves as the **reference model**. Conformance checking is run weekly to detect:
   - Process deviations (e.g., patients bypassing nurse assessment, express patients being routed to the full pathway unnecessarily).
   - New bottleneck formation (bottleneck migration).
   - Resource behavior anomalies (e.g., a new physician taking significantly longer, a diagnostic machine with increased downtime).

3. **Statistical process control (SPC) charts:** Each KPI is tracked on a control chart with upper/lower control limits derived from the post-optimization baseline. Breaches trigger alerts for investigation.

4. **Periodic deep-dive analysis cadence:**
   - **Weekly:** Automated KPI dashboard review by operations manager.
   - **Monthly:** Segmented queue analysis (by specialty, patient type, day-of-week) to detect emerging patterns.
   - **Quarterly:** Full process mining re-analysis including process discovery, variant analysis, and resource analysis to identify structural shifts.

5. **Feedback loops:**
   - KPI trends are shared with physicians and staff monthly to maintain engagement.
   - Patient satisfaction surveys are linked to process data (by visit ID) to correlate objective process metrics with subjective experience.
   - A/B testing approach for incremental changes — e.g., testing a scheduling modification in one department before system-wide rollout.

6. **Drift detection:** Concept drift algorithms monitor whether the process behavior is changing over time (e.g., gradual increase in consultation times due to increasing patient complexity, or gradual degradation of scheduling discipline). Early detection enables proactive intervention before KPIs deteriorate.

**Sustainability Assurance:**

The key risk post-implementation is **regression** — gradual return to old patterns as initial attention fades. Mitigation includes:
- Embedding KPI targets into departmental performance reviews.
- Automating the monitoring (reducing reliance on manual analysis).
- Establishing a dedicated **process owner** role responsible for ongoing optimization.
- Creating a "process improvement committee" with cross-functional representation (physicians, nurses, admin, IT) meeting monthly to review dashboards and approve adjustments.

## Summary

This analysis demonstrates how queue mining, grounded in event log data with start/complete timestamps, provides a rigorous, evidence-based foundation for understanding and improving patient flow. The approach moves from **measurement** (quantifying waits) through **diagnosis** (identifying root causes via resource analysis, variant analysis, and temporal pattern analysis) to **intervention** (five concrete strategies targeting scheduling, pathway design, resource allocation, parallelization, and coordination) and finally to **sustained monitoring** (continuous process mining with tiered KPIs and statistical control). The strategies are designed to be complementary, addressing different root causes simultaneously, and simulation-validated to prevent bottleneck migration. The expected combined impact is a **25–35% reduction in average total visit duration** and a **40–50% reduction in total waiting time**, achievable within 6 months with modest implementation costs.
