Alright, let's start by carefully examining the event log. The goal is to identify activities that appear multiple times within the same case and understand how their meaning changes based on their context.

First, let's list all the activities and see which ones are repeated within a single case:

Looking at Case C001:
1. Initiate Request
2. Verify Documents
3. Call Customer
4. Submit Additional
5. Verify Documents (again)
6. Approve Request

Here, "Verify Documents" appears twice.

Case C002:
1. Initiate Request
2. Verify Documents
3. Call Customer
4. Adjust Account
5. Call Customer (again)
6. Approve Request

Here, "Call Customer" appears twice.

Case C003:
1. Initiate Request
2. Verify Documents
3. Call Customer
4. Adjust Account
5. Verify Documents (again)
6. Approve Request

Here, "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer" appear twice.

So, the recurring activities are:
1. Verify Documents
2. Call Customer

Now, let's analyze the context for each occurrence of these activities.

**Verify Documents:**
- In C001:
  - First occurrence: "Agent checks identity documents."
  - Second occurrence: "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided."
- In C002:
  - Only one occurrence: "Identity verification."
- In C003:
  - First occurrence: "Physical verification of ID."
  - Second occurrence: "Re-verify docs after account adjustment."

So, the first verification is typically the initial check, while the second is a re-verification after some additional steps (like submitting additional documents or adjusting the account).

**Call Customer:**
- In C001:
  - "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs."
- In C002:
  - First: "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy."
  - Second: "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made."
- In C003:
  - "Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return."

Here, the first call is often to request missing information or clarify discrepancies, while the second (when present) is a follow-up to confirm adjustments or other actions.

Now, let's think about how to rename these activities to reflect their contextual differences.

For "Verify Documents":
1. First occurrence: Maybe "Initial Document Verification"
2. Second occurrence: "Re-Verify Documents" or "Final Document Verification"

But looking at the context, the first verification is initial, and the second is after some action (like submitting additional docs or adjusting the account). Maybe better to name them based on the purpose:
1. First: "Initial Document Verification"
2. Second: "Post-Adjustment Document Verification" or "Final Document Verification"

But in C001, the second is after submitting additional docs, so maybe "Re-Verify Documents After Additional Submission"

But to keep it general, perhaps:
1. First: "First Document Verification"
2. Second: "Second Document Verification"

But that's not very descriptive. Maybe better to use the context:
For the first one, it's the initial check. For the second, in C001 it's after additional docs, in C003 it's after account adjustment. Maybe "Re-Verify Documents" for the second one in all cases.

But to be more precise, perhaps:
- First occurrence: "Initial Document Verification"
- Second occurrence: "Document Re-Verification"

For "Call Customer":
In C001: "Verification Call" (since it's to request missing docs for verification)
In C002: first is to clarify discrepancy, second is to confirm adjustments. Maybe:
1. First: "Clarification Call"
2. Second: "Confirmation Call"

In C003: the call is to have the customer return, so maybe "Customer Recall Call"

But to generalize:
First call: often to request missing info or clarify issues. Maybe "Initial Customer Call"
Second call: often to confirm or follow up. Maybe "Follow-Up Customer Call"

Now, let's consider if there are other recurring activities. Looking at the log, "Call Customer" and "Verify Documents" are the main ones that repeat. "Initiate Request" and "Approve Request" appear once per case, so no need to rename them. "Submit Additional" and "Adjust Account" appear once per case where they occur, so no need to rename them unless they repeat, which they don't in the given log.

Now, let's draft the new names:

For "Verify Documents":
- First occurrence: "Initial Document Verification"
- Second occurrence: "Re-Verify Documents"

For "Call Customer":
- First occurrence: "First Customer Contact Call"
- Second occurrence: "Follow-Up Customer Call"

But looking at the contexts:
For C001: first call is for missing docs, second is not present (only one call)
Wait, C001 has one call, C002 has two, C003 has one.

Wait, in C001, there's only one "Call Customer" event, so we don't need to rename it there. Similarly for C003. Only C002 has two "Call Customer" events, so maybe we only need to rename for cases where the activity repeats.

But since our task is to rename activities that appear multiple times within the same case, and in some cases, they appear only once, we might need to consider that the renaming is only necessary when the activity appears more than once in a case. However, the task is to rename activities that appear multiple times within a single case, meaning that if an activity appears multiple times in any case, we need to rename its instances to reflect their context.

In this log, "Verify Documents" appears twice in C001 and C003, and "Call Customer" appears twice only in C002. So we need to rename the instances of these activities where they repeat in a case.

So for "Verify Documents" in C001 and C003, we need to distinguish between the two occurrences. Similarly for "Call Customer" in C002.

Let me think of more precise names based on the context:

For "Verify Documents":
1. In C001: first is "Initial Document Check", second is "Final Document Verification" (since it leads to approval)
2. In C003: first is "Initial Document Check", second is "Post-Adjustment Document Check"

But to have consistent naming, maybe:
First occurrence: "Initial Document Verification"
Second occurrence: "Final Document Verification" (in C001, it leads to approval; in C003, it's after adjustment)

But in C001, the second verification is after submitting additional docs, so maybe "Post-Submission Document Verification"

For "Call Customer" in C002:
1. First: "Clarification Call" (for account discrepancy)
2. Second: "Confirmation Call" (for adjustments)

Now, to generalize, we can use these context-specific names for all cases where the activity repeats.

Now, let's create the revised log with the renamed activities.

First, for "Verify Documents":
- First occurrence in a case: "Initial Document Verification"
- Second occurrence in a case: "Final Document Verification"

But in C003, the second verification is after account adjustment, not necessarily final. Maybe better to call it "Re-Verify Documents" for the second occurrence.

Similarly for "Call Customer":
- First occurrence: "Initial Customer Call"
- Second occurrence: "Follow-Up Customer Call" (as in C002)

Now, let's apply these to the log.

**Case C001:**
1. Initiate Request
2. Verify Documents  Initial Document Verification
3. Call Customer  (only one, so keep as is, but since it's the only one, maybe no need to rename, but to be consistent with other cases where it repeats, perhaps keep the original name)
Wait, since in some cases it repeats and in some it doesn't, maybe we only rename when there are multiple instances in a case.

So for C001 and C003, since "Verify Documents" appears twice, we rename the two instances. For C002, since "Call Customer" appears twice, we rename those two instances. In other cases where the activity appears only once, we keep the original name.

So:

**Revised names:**
For "Verify Documents":
- First occurrence in a case: "Initial Document Verification"
- Second occurrence in a case: "Final Document Verification"

For "Call Customer":
- First occurrence in a case: "Initial Customer Call"
- Second occurrence in a case: "Follow-Up Customer Call"

Now, let's rename the events in the log.

**Revised Event Log:**

```

| C002    | Initiate Request             | 2024-05-02 08:05:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C002    | Initial Document Verification| 2024-05-02 08:15:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Identity verification.                                     |

| C003    | Initiate Request             | 2024-05-03 11:20:00 | BranchReception  | Walk-in customer at branch.                                |
| C003    | Initial Document Verification| 2024-05-03 11:25:00 | BranchOfficer    | Physical verification of ID.                               |
| C003    | Call Customer                | 2024-05-03 11:50:00 | BranchOfficer    | Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return.   |
| C003    | Adjust Account               | 2024-05-03 12:05:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Internal correction due to missing info.                   |
| C003    | Final Document Verification  | 2024-05-03 12:20:00 | BranchOfficer    | Re-verify docs after account adjustment.                   |
| C003    | Approve Request              | 2024-05-03 12:30:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |
```

Now, justify the naming choices:

**Initial Document Verification vs. Final Document Verification:**
- In cases where "Verify Documents" appears twice, the first is the initial check, and the second is after some additional action (like submitting docs or adjusting the account), which is typically a final check before approval.

**Initial Customer Call vs. Follow-Up Customer Call:**
- In cases where "Call Customer" appears twice, the first is typically to clarify or request missing information, and the second is to confirm or follow up on previous actions.

Now, for the presentation, we'll present the revised log with these renamed activities and the justifications.

**Justification:**
1. "Verify Documents" was renamed to "Initial Document Verification" for the first occurrence and "Final Document Verification" for the second occurrence in a case. This distinction is based on their position in the process flow: the first is an initial check, while the second occurs after additional steps and typically precedes final approval.

2. "Call Customer" was renamed to "Initial Customer Call" for the first occurrence and "Follow-Up Customer Call" for the second occurrence in a case (where applicable). This reflects that the first call is often to address initial issues or request information, while the second is to confirm resolutions or adjustments.

```

**Justification for Renaming Choices:**

1. **"Verify Documents" renamed to "Initial Document Verification" and "Final Document Verification":**
   - The first occurrence of "Verify Documents" in a case is always an initial check of the customer's documents, as indicated by the context (e.g., "Agent checks identity documents," "Physical verification of ID"). Renaming this to "Initial Document Verification" makes its purpose clear.
   - The second occurrence happens after some additional action (submitting documents or adjusting the account), and it precedes final approval. Therefore, it's renamed to "Final Document Verification" to reflect its role in confirming that all documents are now in order for approval.

2. **"Call Customer" renamed to "Initial Customer Call" and "Follow-Up Customer Call":**
   - In cases where "Call Customer" appears twice (e.g., C002), the first call is typically to clarify issues or request missing information (e.g., "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy"), so it's renamed to "Initial Customer Call."
   - The second call is a follow-up to confirm that previous actions were successful (e.g., "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made"), hence the name "Follow-Up Customer Call."
   - In cases where "Call Customer" appears only once (e.g., C001, C003), the original name is retained as it doesn’t require disambiguation.

These renamings ensure that the activities clearly reflect their contextual differences, improving the clarity of the process flow.
