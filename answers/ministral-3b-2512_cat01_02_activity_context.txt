### **Analysis & Renaming of Recurring Activities**

The log contains two activities that appear multiple times within the same case:
1. **`Verify Documents`** – Appears twice in **Case C001** and once in **Case C003** (though the second occurrence in C003 is distinct due to context).
2. **`Call Customer`** – Appears twice in **Case C002** and once in **Case C003**.

---

### **1. Renaming `Verify Documents`**
The meaning of `Verify Documents` changes based on:
- **First occurrence**: Initial document review (often after submission).
- **Second occurrence**: Re-verification after additional context (e.g., missing documents or adjustments).

#### **Renamed Activities:**
- **`Initial Document Review`** (First occurrence)
- **`Re-Verify Documents`** (Second occurrence)

---

### **2. Renaming `Call Customer`**
The meaning of `Call Customer` changes based on:
- **First occurrence**: Follow-up due to incomplete verification (missing documents).
- **Second occurrence**: Follow-up to confirm adjustments made after an internal change.

#### **Renamed Activities:**
- **`Follow-Up for Missing Documents`** (First occurrence in C001)
- **`Confirm Adjustments`** (Second occurrence in C002)
- **`Recall Customer`** (First occurrence in C003, since the customer left the branch)

---

### **3. Renaming `Adjust Account`**
This activity appears only once in **Case C002** and **Case C003**, but its context differs slightly:
- **Case C002**: Adjusts account after an outbound call to clarify discrepancies.
- **Case C003**: Adjusts account due to missing information (not directly tied to a call).

#### **Renamed Activity:**
- **`Internal Account Adjustment`** (Generalized, as the meaning is consistent in both cases)

### **Justification of Naming Choices**
1. **`Initial Document Review` vs. `Re-Verify Documents`**
   - The first occurrence is a **one-time check** after submission.
   - The second occurrence is a **follow-up verification** after additional context (e.g., missing documents or adjustments).

2. **`Follow-Up for Missing Documents` vs. `Confirm Adjustments`**
   - The first `Call Customer` in **C001** is due to **incomplete verification** (missing documents).
   - The second `Call Customer` in **C002** is a **follow-up to confirm changes** made after an internal adjustment.

3. **`Recall Customer` (C003)**
   - The call in **C003** is different because the customer **left the branch**, requiring an officer to **recall** them.

4. **`Internal Account Adjustment`**
   - This term is used consistently because the meaning (adjusting account details internally) is the same in both cases, regardless of the trigger.

This renaming ensures that the log clearly distinguishes between different stages of the same activity, improving traceability and process understanding.
