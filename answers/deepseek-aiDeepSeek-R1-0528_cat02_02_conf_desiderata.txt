We are given an event log with three cases. We need to check for violations of normative rules (strict) and desiderata (recommended but not strict).

Normative Rules (Strict):
1. Sequence must be: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case
2. Specific ordering rules:
   - Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
   - Risk Assessment must occur before Loan Decision.
   - Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision.
   - If approved: Finalize Documentation must occur before Close Case.
   - If rejected: do not finalize documentation before closing the case.

What is not allowed:
- Skipping activities in the sequence.
- Changing the order (e.g., Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
- Performing Finalize Documentation after a rejection.
- Closing the case without following the decision logic.

Desiderata (Recommended):
1. Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours after application is received.
2. Inform Applicant should be done within 48 hours of the loan decision.
3. It is encouraged to perform a Follow-up Call before closing the case (but not required).

Now, let's analyze each case:

Case 1:
- Activities in order: 
  Application Received (2024-01-10 09:00)
  Credit Check (2024-01-10 09:30) -> within 24 hours? Yes (same day, within 30 minutes)
  Risk Assessment (2024-01-10 10:00) -> after Credit Check? Yes
  Loan Decision (Approved) (2024-01-10 11:00) -> after Risk Assessment? Yes
  Inform Applicant (2024-01-10 13:00) -> after Loan Decision? Yes (within 2 hours, so within 48 hours)
  Finalize Documentation (2024-01-10 13:30) -> because approved, and before Close Case? Yes
  Close Case (2024-01-10 14:00)

Normative rules: 
  - Sequence is correct: Application Received -> Credit Check -> Risk Assessment -> Loan Decision -> Inform Applicant -> Finalize Documentation -> Close Case (and since approved, finalize is required).
  - No violations.

Desiderata:
  - Credit Check within 24 hours: yes (30 minutes after application).
  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of loan decision: loan decision at 11:00, inform at 13:00 same day -> within 2 hours, so yes.
  - Follow-up Call: not present, but it's only recommended. So this is a desideratum violation? Actually, the desideratum says "sometime before closing the case", but it's not present. However, it's not a strict rule. So we note that it's missing but it's not a normative violation.

Case 2:
- Activities:
  Application Received (2024-01-11 08:00)
  Risk Assessment (2024-01-11 08:20) -> This is before Credit Check? Yes, and Credit Check hasn't happened yet -> violates normative rule: Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
  Credit Check (2024-01-11 09:00) -> now happens after Risk Assessment -> which is out of order.
  Loan Decision (Rejected) (2024-01-11 09:30)
  Finalize Documentation (2024-01-11 10:00) -> but loan was rejected -> normative violation: should not finalize documentation after rejection.
  Close Case (2024-01-11 10:30)

Normative violations:
  1. Ordering: Risk Assessment was done before Credit Check (violates "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment").
  2. After rejection, they performed Finalize Documentation (which is not allowed).

Desiderata:
  - Credit Check: happened at 09:00, which is 1 hour after application (08:00) -> within 24 hours? Yes (1 hour).
  - Inform Applicant: missing? Wait, the log does not have "Inform Applicant" activity at all. 
    But normative rule requires that Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. So skipping an activity (Inform Applicant) is a normative violation? 
    Let me check the log: 
      Case 2: 
        Application Received
        Risk Assessment
        Credit Check
        Loan Decision (Rejected)
        Finalize Documentation
        Close Case

    We don't see "Inform Applicant". This is a violation of the normative sequence: the step "Inform Applicant" is skipped.

    So actually, there are three normative violations in Case 2:
      a) Skipped "Inform Applicant" (which is required in the sequence).
      b) Ordering: Risk Assessment before Credit Check.
      c) Finalize Documentation after rejection.

Desiderata:
  - Even if we check timing: 
      Credit Check was within 24 hours? Yes (1 hour).
      Inform Applicant: not present -> so we cannot check timing. But note: the absence of Inform Applicant is a normative violation, so desiderata for timing of Inform Applicant is irrelevant.

  - Follow-up call: not present -> but that's only a desideratum.

Case 3:
- Activities:
  Application Received (2024-01-12 09:00)
  Credit Check (2024-01-14 10:00) -> more than 24 hours? 
      From 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00: 
          Jan 12: 15 hours (from 09:00 to 24:00) -> 15 hours
          Jan 13: full day -> 24 hours
          Jan 14: 10 hours (from 00:00 to 10:00) -> 10 hours
          Total: 15+24+10 = 49 hours -> more than 24 hours -> violates desideratum (but not normative).
  Risk Assessment (2024-01-14 11:00) -> after Credit Check? Yes (same day, one hour later)
  Loan Decision (Approved) (2024-01-14 12:00)
  Inform Applicant (2024-01-16 15:00) -> 
      Time from Loan Decision (2024-01-14 12:00) to Inform Applicant (2024-01-16 15:00):
          Jan 14: 12 hours (from 12:00 to 24:00) -> 12 hours
          Jan 15: 24 hours
          Jan 16: 15 hours (from 00:00 to 15:00) -> 15 hours
          Total: 12+24+15 = 51 hours -> more than 48 hours -> violates desideratum.
  Finalize Documentation (2024-01-17 09:00)
  Close Case (2024-01-17 10:00)

Normative rules:
  Sequence: 
      Application Received -> Credit Check -> Risk Assessment -> Loan Decision -> Inform Applicant -> Finalize Documentation -> Close Case.
  Since approved, Finalize Documentation is required and it is done before Close Case.

  Check order:
      Credit Check before Risk Assessment: yes.
      Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: yes.
      Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: yes (but late, which is only desideratum).
      Finalize Documentation after approval: yes, and before Close Case.

  So no normative violations.

Desiderata:
  - Credit Check took 49 hours (more than 24) -> violation of desideratum.
  - Inform Applicant took 51 hours (more than 48) -> violation of desideratum.
  - Follow-up call: not present -> violation of desideratum.

Summary:

Normative Violations:
- Case 1: None.
- Case 2: 
    1. Skipped "Inform Applicant" (required step).
    2. Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check (order violation).
    3. Finalize Documentation performed after rejection (not allowed).
- Case 3: None.

Desiderata Violations:
- Case 1: Missing Follow-up Call (but note: the desideratum says "sometime before closing", so missing it is a violation of the recommendation). However, the log does not show it. Also, timing for Credit Check and Inform Applicant were good.
- Case 2: 
    - Credit Check was within 24 hours? Actually, it was done within 1 hour -> so no timing violation for Credit Check.
    - Inform Applicant: skipped -> so we cannot check timing, but skipping is a normative violation so we don't consider desiderata for timing of this step? Actually, the desiderata for timing of Inform Applicant would only apply if the step exists. Since it doesn't, we don't have a desideratum violation for timing of Inform Applicant? But note: the desiderata says "applicant is informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision)" - but if the step is skipped, then the desideratum about timing doesn't apply because the step is missing. However, the main issue is the normative violation of skipping the step.
    - Follow-up call: missing -> violation of desideratum.
- Case 3:
    - Credit Check: took 49 hours (>24) -> violation.
    - Inform Applicant: took 51 hours (>48) -> violation.
    - Follow-up call: missing -> violation.

Suggestions for interpretations:

Case 2: 
  The normative violations are severe. The process did not follow the required sequence. 
  Why might this happen? 
    - Perhaps an error: the Risk Assessment was done by mistake before the Credit Check. 
    - Also, the step "Inform Applicant" was skipped entirely. This might be an oversight.
    - Finalizing documentation for a rejected loan might be a mistake (maybe the employee did not update the system correctly).

Case 3: 
  The delays might be due to high workload or a backlog. The missing follow-up call might be because the team was busy. 
  Since these are only desiderata, it's not a critical issue but indicates areas for improvement.

Case 1: 
  It followed the normative rules and met the timing desiderata, but the follow-up call was missing. 
  Why? Maybe the team decided that for a straightforward approval, a follow-up call was not necessary? Or it might be an oversight.

Note: The desiderata violations are not severe, but they represent suboptimal behavior (delays and missing an optional step).

Final Output:

1. Normative Violations:
   - Case 1: None.
   - Case 2: 
        a) Skipped the mandatory step "Inform Applicant".
        b) Performed Risk Assessment before Credit Check (violating the order).
        c) Performed Finalize Documentation after a rejection (which is not allowed).
   - Case 3: None.

2. Desiderata Violations:
   - Case 1: Missing Follow-up Call (suboptimal: it's recommended to have a follow-up call before closing).
   - Case 2: Missing Follow-up Call (suboptimal).
   - Case 3: 
        a) Credit Check was delayed (49 hours, exceeding the recommended 24 hours).
        b) Inform Applicant was delayed (51 hours, exceeding the recommended 48 hours).
        c) Missing Follow-up Call.

3. Interpretations:
   - Case 2: The violations of normative rules might be due to human error or a system glitch. For example, an employee might have accidentally performed Risk Assessment before the Credit Check was available, skipped informing the applicant (which is a serious oversight), and then incorrectly finalized documentation for a rejected loan (which should not happen). This case requires investigation and correction.
   - Case 3: The delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant might be due to a backlog of applications or resource constraints. The missing follow-up call might be due to time pressure. While not critical, these delays could lead to customer dissatisfaction and should be addressed to improve service quality.
   - Case 1: The missing follow-up call might be a conscious decision to skip it for efficiency in a straightforward case, or an oversight. Since it's only recommended, it's less critical.

### Analysis of Event Log

#### 1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Constraints)
**Case 2** violates normative rules for the following reasons:  
- **Order Violation:**  
  - `Risk Assessment` (2024-01-11 08:20) occurs *before* `Credit Check` (2024-01-11 09:00).  
  - **Rule broken:** *Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment*.  
- **Contradictory Action:**  
  - `Finalize Documentation` (2024-01-11 10:00) is performed *after* a `Loan Decision (Rejected)`.  
  - **Rule broken:** *If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case*.  
- **Skipped Activity:**  
  - `Inform Applicant` is missing entirely after `Loan Decision`.  
  - **Rule broken:** *Sequence requires Inform Applicant after Loan Decision*.  

**Cases 1 and 3** adhere to all normative rules.  

---

#### 2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended Practices)  
**Case 1**:  
- **Follow-up Call** is missing (recommended before closing).  
- *No timing issues*: Credit Check (30min after application) and Inform Applicant (2hr after decision) meet recommendations.  

**Case 2**:  
- **Follow-up Call** is missing (recommended before closing).  
- *Timing is acceptable*: Credit Check occurs within 1hr of application (within 24hr window).  

**Case 3**:  
- **Credit Check Timing**:  
  - Occurs on 2024-01-14 10:00 (49hr after application on 2024-01-12 09:00).  
  - **Violation:** Exceeds 24hr recommendation.  
- **Inform Applicant Timing**:  
  - Occurs on 2024-01-16 15:00 (51hr after decision on 2024-01-14 12:00).  
  - **Violation:** Exceeds 48hr recommendation.  
- **Follow-up Call** is missing (recommended before closing).  

> **Clarification on Desiderata**:  
> These deviations (delays/missing follow-up) are **not severe** but indicate suboptimal efficiency or customer engagement. They do not break core process integrity.  

---

#### 3. Interpretations & Justifications  
**Case 2 (Normative Violations)**:  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**:  
  Likely a **human error** (e.g., employee skipped prerequisites due to oversight or miscommunication).  
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**:  
  Potentially a **system error** (e.g., automated task triggered incorrectly) or **procedural lapse** (e.g., employee ignored decision status).  
- **Missing Inform Applicant**:  
  Suggests **process negligence** (e.g., forgotten step in rejection handling).  

**Case 3 (Desiderata Violations)**:  
- **Delayed Credit Check (49hr)**:  
  Justified by **high workload** (e.g., application received before a weekend) or **manual dependency** (e.g., external data delays).  
- **Delayed Inform Applicant (51hr)**:  
  Could stem from **approval complexity** (e.g., additional internal approvals) or **resource constraints**.  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**:  
  **Prioritization trade-off** (e.g., focus on backlog clearance over optional steps).  

**Case 1 (Desiderata Violation)**:  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**:  
  May reflect **efficiency-driven choice** (e.g., deemed unnecessary for a smooth approval) or **time pressure**.

### Summary Table  
| Case | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Violations? |  
|------|------------------------|------------------------|  
| 1    | None                  | Missing Follow-up Call |  
| 2    | **Yes** (Order skip + Invalid action) | Missing Follow-up Call |  
| 3    | None                  | Late Credit Check + Late Inform + Missing Follow-up |  

**Key**:  
- Normative violations = **Process failure** (requires correction).  
- Desiderata violations = **Improvement opportunity** (optimize timing/communication).
