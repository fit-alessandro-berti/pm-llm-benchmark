## **BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

### **Overview**
This textual model captures the **Invoice Approval Process** based on interviews with Accounts Payable (AP), Purchasing, Department Management, and Supplier Relationship roles. It reflects the **typical flow**, **decision points**, **roles/participants**, **artifacts**, and **exceptions/variations**. This representation is designed to be clear and unambiguous so that it can be directly translated into a BPMN diagram.
