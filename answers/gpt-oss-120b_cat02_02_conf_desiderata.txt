We need to answer the three tasks. Provide clear identification per case. Explain normative violations: case 2 violates because Risk Assessment before Credit Check, and Finalize Documentation after rejection. Also maybe missing Inform Applicant? Actually case 2 has no Inform Applicant, but normative says Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. So also missing that. So multiple violations.

Case 1 follows all normative rules, no violations. Case 3 follows normative sequence (Application, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Decision, Inform, Finalize, Close). No Inform before decision? It's after decision, okay. No finalization after rejection (approved). So normative okay.

Desiderata: case 2 also has timing? Credit Check after 20 min? That's within 24h, okay. Inform Applicant missing, but timing not relevant. But also no follow-up call. That's a desideratum violation for all cases (none have follow-up). Also case 3 violates timing: credit check after >24h, inform after >48h. So note.

Provide suggestions/interpretations: maybe delays due to workload, risk assessment before credit check could be due to parallel processing but violates rule; could be data entry error. For case 2 finalizing docs after rejection maybe a mistake, could be automated step not disabled. Provide recommendations.

Make sure to format with bullet points, maybe tables. Use LaTeX for any math? Not needed. Provide clear answer.

**1. Normative‑rule violations**

| Case | Violation(s) | Why it breaks the hard constraints |
|------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| **1** | – | No violation – the case follows the exact sequence **Application → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Decision (Approved) → Inform → Finalize Documentation → Close**. |
| **2** | 1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**  <br>2. **Missing “Inform Applicant”**  <br>3. **Finalizing documentation after a rejection** | 1. The rule *“Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment”* is broken (the log shows Risk Assessment at 08:20, Credit Check at 08:20 + 40 min).  <br>2. The normative rule *“Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision”* is not satisfied – there is no “Inform Applicant” event at all.  <br>3. After a **Rejected** decision the process must go straight to *Close Case*; the activity *Finalize Documentation* is prohibited in that branch. |
| **3** | – | All required activities appear in the correct order and the decision‑branch logic is respected (Approved → Finalize Documentation → Close). No hard‑rule breach. |

**2. Desiderata (recommended but not mandatory) failures**

| Case | Desideratum not met | Explanation (why it is only a “soft” breach) |
|------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **1** | None | All timings are within the suggested windows and a follow‑up call is *optional* – its absence does not constitute a violation. |
| **2** | • No **Follow‑up Call** (optional)  <br>• Timing of “Inform Applicant” cannot be judged (activity missing) | The follow‑up call is a best‑practice; skipping it is merely sub‑optimal. |
| **3** | • **Credit Check** performed **> 24 h** after the application (≈ 49 h)  <br>• **Inform Applicant** sent **> 48 h** after the decision (≈ 51 h)  <br>• No **Follow‑up Call** | The two timing windows are recommendations; exceeding them does not break the process logic, but it may affect customer satisfaction. The missing follow‑up call is again a non‑critical omission. |

**3. Possible interpretations / justifications**

| Case | Observation | Reasonable interpretation (still respecting the constraints) |
|------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **2** | *Risk Assessment* logged before *Credit Check*. | The organization may have run a **pre‑screen** risk model that does not need credit‑bureau data, and later performed the formal credit check for compliance. However, because the normative rule explicitly requires the credit check first, the log likely reflects a **data‑entry error** or a **mis‑ordered automated trigger**. |
| **2** | *Finalize Documentation* after a **Rejected** decision. | An **automated workflow** might have a “finalize” step that is always triggered, and the operator forgot to disable it for rejections. The step is harmless (no documents to sign) but violates the rule that finalization is only for approved loans. |
| **2** | Missing *Inform Applicant*. | The notification could have been sent **outside the system** (e.g., via a manual phone call) and therefore not recorded in the event log. From a compliance standpoint, the rule still expects a recorded “Inform Applicant” event, so the log shows a breach. |
| **3** | Credit check delayed > 24 h and inform‑outcome delayed > 48 h. | The delay may be due to **high workload**, **weekend/holiday processing**, or the need for **additional documentation** from the applicant before the credit bureau could be queried. While not ideal, the process still respects the mandatory ordering. |
| **3** & **2** | No *Follow‑up Call*. | The follow‑up call is optional; perhaps the team decided the **email notification** and the **final documentation** were sufficient, or the call was omitted to reduce operational cost. This is acceptable under the desiderata definition. |

### Summary

| Case | Normative‑rule status | Desiderata status |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **1** | ✅ Compliant | ✅ All recommendations met |
| **2** | ❌ Violates three hard rules (order, missing inform, illegal finalization) | ⚠️ Misses optional follow‑up (soft) |
| **3** | ✅ Compliant | ⚠️ Violates two timing recommendations and optional follow‑up (soft) |

**Recommendations**

1. **For case 2** – Review the workflow engine to enforce the *Credit Check → Risk Assessment* order and to suppress the *Finalize Documentation* step when the decision is “Rejected”. Ensure that every decision triggers a recorded *Inform Applicant* event (even if the communication is manual).  
2. **For case 3** – Consider adding **SLA monitoring** that flags activities exceeding the 24‑hour (credit check) and 48‑hour (inform) windows, allowing the team to intervene before the deadline.  
3. **Across all cases** – Introduce a **“Follow‑up Call”** activity in the model (optional) and optionally log it, so that the desideratum can be measured and improved over time.
