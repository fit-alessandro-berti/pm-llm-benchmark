Okay, let's trace the events and infer the cases. The primary identifiers we can use are `patient_age` and `patient_gender`, combined with the chronological sequence and logical flow of hospital activities (e.g., Register -> Triage -> Consult -> Test/Imaging -> Consult -> Discharge/Admit).

**Inferred Case 1: Patient (45, M) - ER Visit for Fracture**

1.  **Event 1:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z`, `activity: Register patient`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 45`, `patient_gender: M` - *Case starts here.*
2.  **Event 4:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z`, `activity: Initial triage`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 45`, `patient_gender: M` - *Logical next step after ER registration.*

**Inferred Case 2: Patient (62, F) - ER Visit for Infection**

1.  **Event 2:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z`, `activity: Register patient`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F` - *Case starts here.*
2.  **Event 5:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z`, `activity: Initial triage`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F` - *Logical next step after ER registration.*
3.  **Event 8:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z`, `activity: Lab test requested`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F` - *Doctor orders tests after triage.* `additional_info: test_type=blood_panel`
4.  **Event 10:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z`, `activity: Lab test completed`, `department: Laboratory`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F` - *Lab completes the requested test.*
5.  **Event 11:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z`, `activity: Doctor consultation`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F` - *Consultation after lab results.* `additional_info: diagnosis=minor_infection`
6.  **Event 14:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z`, `activity: Prescription created`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F` - *Prescription based on diagnosis.* `additional_info: medication=antibiotics` (consistent with infection).
7.  **Event 17:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z`, `activity: Patient discharged`, `department: ER`, `patient_age: 62`, `patient_gender: F` - *Discharged from ER.* `additional_info: followup=pharmacy_pickup` (consistent with prescription).

**Inferred Case 3: Patient (28, M) - Scheduled Surgery**

1.  **Event 3:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z`, `activity: Register patient`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M` - *Case starts here (note: Surgery dept).*
2.  **Event 6:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z`, `activity: Doctor consultation`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M` - *Pre-op consultation.* `additional_info: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery` (consistent with Surgery dept registration).
3.  **Event 9:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z`, `activity: Surgery preparation`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M` - *Preparation for the scheduled surgery.*
4.  **Event 13:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z`, `activity: Surgery performed`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M` - *The surgery itself.* `additional_info: procedure=arthroscopy` (consistent with knee surgery).
5.  **Event 16:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z`, `activity: Recovery room`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M` - *Post-operative recovery.*
6.  **Event 18:** `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z`, `activity: Patient discharged`, `department: Surgery`, `patient_age: 28`, `patient_gender: M` - *Discharged after recovery.* `additional_info: followup=physiotherapy_sessions` (consistent with knee surgery).

**Summary of Case Groupings by Event Number:**

*   **Case 1 (Patient 45, M):** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
*   **Case 2 (Patient 62, F):** Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
*   **Case 3 (Patient 28, M):** Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

This grouping is based on the unique combination of `patient_age` and `patient_gender` for each inferred case, combined with the chronological order and logical sequence of activities within typical hospital workflows (ER vs. Surgery). The department information and `additional_info` further corroborate these distinct patient journeys.
