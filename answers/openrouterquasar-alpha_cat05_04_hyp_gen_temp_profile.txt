### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

- **Receive ("R")  Approve ("P"):**  
  Average duration is approximately 25 hours (~1.04 days), but standard deviation is only 1 hour. Such tight variability around a long interval suggests an unnaturally rigid schedule or system-imposed timing rather than natural variation — potentially an automated trigger, batch approval, or data entry artifact.

- **Approve ("P")  Notify ("N"):**  
  Average is 7 days with a large standard deviation of 2 days. This wide spread indicates inconsistent delays — ranging from prompt notification to much longer waits — perhaps caused by process bottlenecks, backlog, or manual follow-ups varying in punctuality.

- **Assign ("A")  Close ("C"):**  
  On average only 2 hours elapse between assignment and closure. This is unexpectedly brief if intermediate steps (e.g., Evaluate, Approve) are essential, signaling potential step bypassing or superficial closure of certain claims.

- **Evaluate ("E")  Notify ("N"):**  
  A rapid 5-minute average transition suggests automation, skipped approvals, or premature notifications before all assessments are properly completed.

### Hypotheses Explaining Temporal Anomalies

- **Rigid Timing (low STDEV RP):**  
  Approval processes might be automated, batch-processed at fixed intervals, or have systematically delayed approvals to align with business cycles. Alternatively, timestamps might be system-generated rather than recording actual human response times.

- **Inconsistent Notification Lag (high avg/STDEV PN):**  
  Delays from approval to notification may arise from manual outreach bottlenecks, differing notification channels (email vs. phone), or backlog fluctuations. Holidays or staff shortages might also cause inconsistent waits.

- **Premature Closures (short AC times):**  
  Certain low-value or non-covered claims might be fast-tracked to closure without full evaluation. Alternatively, misclassification or procedural shortcuts might skip expected steps.

- **Over-automation or Step Skipping (fast EN):**  
  Notifications may be automatically triggered immediately upon record update without waiting for formal approval, or approval might be omitted entirely for some claim types.

### Proposed SQL Queries for Verification

**1. Identify claims with rigid approval timing (RP with very low variability):**
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       ce1.timestamp AS receive_time,
       ce3.timestamp AS approve_time,
       EXTRACT(epoch FROM ce3.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)/3600 AS hours_diff
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce3 ON ce1.claim_id = ce3.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce3.activity = 'P'
ORDER BY hours_diff;
-- Look for clustering tightly around ~25 hours
```

**2. Detect claims with long or highly variable time from approval to notification (PN):**
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id,
       ce.timestamp AS approve_time,
       ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
       EXTRACT(epoch FROM ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)/86400 AS days_diff
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
ORDER BY days_diff DESC;
-- Flagging claims where days_diff significantly exceeds 7 or is unusually short
```

**3. Find claims closed swiftly after assignment (AC in <1 hour):**
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id,
       ce.timestamp AS assign_time,
       ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
       EXTRACT(epoch FROM ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)/60 AS diff_minutes
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
  AND EXTRACT(epoch FROM ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp) < 3600
ORDER BY diff_minutes;
```

**4. Check if such fast-closed claims also skip Evaluate ("E") or Approve ("P"):**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM (
    SELECT ce.claim_id
    FROM claim_events ce
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
      AND EXTRACT(epoch FROM ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp) < 3600
) AS c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce3 ON c.claim_id = ce3.claim_id AND ce3.activity IN ('E', 'P')
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(ce3.event_id) = 0;
-- Claims closed quickly without Evaluation or Approval events
```

**5. Correlate long notification delays after approval with adjuster, region, or claim type:**
```sql
SELECT a.adjuster_id,
       a.region,
       cl.claim_type,
       AVG(EXTRACT(epoch FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)/86400) AS avg_days_approve_to_notify,
       COUNT(*) AS num_claims
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN claims cl ON ce1.claim_id = cl.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.name
WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.region, cl.claim_type
ORDER BY avg_days_approve_to_notify DESC;
-- Identify segments contributing most to notification delays
```

**6. Analyze correlations between anomalies and claim amounts/types:**
```sql
SELECT cl.claim_type,
       CASE 
         WHEN cl.claim_amount < 1000 THEN 'low'
         WHEN cl.claim_amount < 5000 THEN 'medium'
         ELSE 'high'
       END AS claim_value_band,
       AVG(EXTRACT(epoch FROM ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)/3600) AS avg_hours_receive_to_approve,
       AVG(EXTRACT(epoch FROM ce4.timestamp - ce3.timestamp)/86400) AS avg_days_approve_to_notify
FROM claims cl
JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = cl.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce2.claim_id = cl.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
JOIN claim_events ce3 ON ce3.claim_id = cl.claim_id AND ce3.activity = 'P'
JOIN claim_events ce4 ON ce4.claim_id = cl.claim_id AND ce4.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY cl.claim_type, claim_value_band
ORDER BY claim_type, claim_value_band;
-- Assess if anomalous timings correspond to claim size or type
```

These analyses can pinpoint whether anomalies stem from process design, resource allocation, automation triggers, data entry delays, or selective claim handling, guiding further investigation or process refinement.
