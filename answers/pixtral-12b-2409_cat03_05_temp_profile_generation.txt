Certainly! Below is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for a subset of activity pairs in the global supply chain process. The times are estimated based on typical durations for each activity and the overall process flow.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (24 * 3600, 4 * 3600),  # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: 1 day avg, 4 hours stddev
    ('OP', 'RC'): (7 * 24 * 3600, 2 * 24 * 3600),  # Order Placement to Receive Components: 7 days avg, 2 days stddev
    ('RC', 'QI'): (4 * 3600, 2 * 3600),  # Receive Components to Quality Inspection: 4 hours avg, 2 hours stddev
    ('QI', 'CA'): (8 * 3600, 2 * 3600),  # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: 8 hours avg, 2 hours stddev
    ('CA', 'PT'): (12 * 3600, 3 * 3600),  # Component Assembly to Product Testing: 12 hours avg, 3 hours stddev
    ('PT', 'PK'): (6 * 3600, 1 * 3600),  # Product Testing to Packaging: 6 hours avg, 1 hour stddev
    ('PK', 'WS'): (2 * 3600, 500 * 60),  # Packaging to Warehouse Storage: 2 hours avg, 8 minutes stddev
    ('WS', 'DT'): (3 * 24 * 3600, 1 * 24 * 3600),  # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: 3 days avg, 1 day stddev
    ('DT', 'AS'): (7 * 24 * 3600, 2 * 24 * 3600),  # Distribution to After-Sales Support: 7 days avg, 2 days stddev
    ('SS', 'RC'): (9 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Supplier Selection to Receive Components: 9 days avg, 3 days stddev
    ('OP', 'CA'): (10 * 24 * 3600, 2 * 24 * 3600),  # Order Placement to Component Assembly: 10 days avg, 2 days stddev
    ('RC', 'PT'): (14 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Receive Components to Product Testing: 14 days avg, 3 days stddev
    ('QI', 'PK'): (16 * 3600, 4 * 3600),  # Quality Inspection to Packaging: 16 hours avg, 4 hours stddev
    ('CA', 'PK'): (20 * 3600, 3 * 3600),  # Component Assembly to Packaging: 20 hours avg, 3 hours stddev
    ('PT', 'WS'): (18 * 3600, 3 * 3600),  # Product Testing to Warehouse Storage: 18 hours avg, 3 hours stddev
    ('PK', 'AS'): (10 * 24 * 3600, 2 * 24 * 3600),  # Packaging to After-Sales Support: 10 days avg, 2 days stddev
    ('DT', 'AS'): (1 * 3600, 1 * 3600),  # Distribution to After-Sales Support: 1 hour avg, 1 hour stddev
    ('SS', 'QI'): (11 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection: 11 days avg, 3 days stddev
    ('SS', 'CA'): (13 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Supplier Selection to Component Assembly: 13 days avg, 3 days stddev
    ('SS', 'PT'): (15 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Supplier Selection to Product Testing: 15 days avg, 3 days stddev
    ('SS', 'PK'): (16 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Supplier Selection to Packaging: 16 days avg, 3 days stddev
    ('SS', 'WS'): (17 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Supplier Selection to Warehouse Storage: 17 days avg, 3 days stddev
    ('SS', 'DT'): (18 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Supplier Selection to Distribution: 18 days avg, 3 days stddev
    ('SS', 'AS'): (19 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Supplier Selection to After-Sales Support: 19 days avg, 3 days stddev
}

This dictionary includes a representative subset of activity pairs, considering both directly connected and indirectly connected activities. The average times and standard deviations are estimated based on typical durations for each activity in a global supply chain process.
