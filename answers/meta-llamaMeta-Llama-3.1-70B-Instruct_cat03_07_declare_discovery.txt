To generate a DECLARE model for the given process, we will create a Python dictionary that contains the declarative rules as described in the problem statement. 

We will define the following rules:

- Existence: all activities occur at least once.
- Initialization: the process starts with the "Create Fine" activity.
- Response: after "Create Fine", "Send Fine" occurs.
- Chain Response: "Send Fine" is directly followed by "Insert Fine Notification".
- Chain Response: "Insert Fine Notification" is directly followed by "Add penalty".
- Response: after "Add penalty", either "Payment" or "Send for Credit Collection" occurs.
- Response: after "Insert Fine Notification", either "Payment" or "Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture" occurs.

Here is the Python code that generates the DECLARE model:

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Add penalty': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send for Credit Collection': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Appeal to Judge': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'response': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): {'support': 0.5, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'): {'support': 0.5, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Payment'): {'support': 0.5, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'): {'support': 0.5, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'chainresponse': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    }
}
```

This model captures the basic structure of the process and the relationships between the activities. However, please note that this is a simplified model and may not capture all the nuances of the process. The DECLARE model can be further refined and extended to include additional rules and constraints as needed.
