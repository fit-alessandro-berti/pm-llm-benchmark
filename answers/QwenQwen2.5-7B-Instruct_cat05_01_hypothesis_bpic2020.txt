Certainly! Below is a list of 20 relevant questions related to the process, along with a confidence score (on a scale of 1 to 10) for each question based on how frequently the process variants involve the activities mentioned.

1. **How often is the declaration submitted directly by the employee without any further approvals?**
   - **Confidence Score:** 8
   - This is frequent in the process and involves the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" step.

2. **Do employees usually request payment directly after getting final approval from the supervisor?**
   - **Confidence Score:** 7
   - This is a common step following the "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and "Request Payment" steps.

3. **How many instances involve a declaration being rejected by the administrative team more than once?**
   - **Confidence Score:** 9
   - This is seen in several variants, indicating it's a frequently occurring issue.

4. **Are there common reasons that lead to rejection by the budget owner, and how does this affect the approval process?**
   - **Confidence Score:** 7
   - This step is crucial before the final supervisor approval, making it a critical path.

5. **How often does a declaration require multiple rejections by the administration or employee before final submission?**
   - **Confidence Score:** 9
   - Several variants show this step multiple times.

6. **Is there a correlation between the number of rejections and the overall performance metric of the process?**
   - **Confidence Score:** 8
   - This is evident in the frequency and performance metrics of high-rejection cases.

7. **Do pre-approvals significantly affect the overall performance and frequency of the payment processing?**
   - **Confidence Score:** 8
   - This is seen in several steps involving the "PRE_APPROVER" and "APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER."

8. **How do rejections by the supervisor affect the final performance of the process?**
   - **Confidence Score:** 9
   - Several variants show supervisor rejections before final approval.

9. **Are there significant differences in performance between processes that go through the budget owner and those that do not?**
   - **Confidence Score:** 7
   - This involves steps with "APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER."

10. **Does the frequency of rejections by the supervisor or the budget owner impact the final performance?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 8
    - Multiple variants illustrate this.

11. **How does having multiple approvals (by administration, budget owner, and supervisor) impact the overall process performance?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 8
    - This involves the variants with multiple approvals.

12. **Are there any common patterns that lead to multiple rounds of rejections and resubmissions?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 9
    - Several variants suggest issues leading to repeated rejections and resubmissions.

13. **How does the inclusion of the pre-approver affect the overall process flow and performance?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 8
    - Variants involving "APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER" are frequent.

14. **Does the presence of missing data or incomplete information lead to delays and increased rejection rates?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 8
    - Several variants involve missing data leading to rejections and resubmissions.

15. **Is there an impact on performance if the declaration is not resubmitted after each rejection?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 9
    - Several variants show missed resubmissions leading to further rejections.

16. **Does the frequency of the re-submission of declarations after rejections significantly affect the overall process performance?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 8
    - This is common across many variants involving multiple rejections.

17. **Are there significant differences in process performance that can be attributed to different pre-approval teams?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 7
    - This involves the "PRE_APPROVER" and "APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER" roles.

18. **Do variations in the number of approvals (single vs. multiple) significantly impact the frequency and performance of the process?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 8
    - Several variants involve different numbers of approvals.

19. **Is there a relationship between the presence of pre-approvals and the frequency of rejections by the supervisors?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 7
    - Variants with both a pre-approver and subsequent supervisor approval steps are common.

20. **Does the presence of a missing declaration lead to significant performance impacts?**
    - **Confidence Score:** 9
    - Several variants involve declarations being rejected due to missing information or steps.

These questions cover various aspects of the process and can help in identifying areas for improvement and potential bottlenecks.
