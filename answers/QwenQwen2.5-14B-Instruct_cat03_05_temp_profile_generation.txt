To address the task, we need to construct a Python dictionary that represents the temporal profile of a complex global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics. We will provide estimated average times and standard deviations for a subset of activity pairs that may be separated by multiple steps in the process. The goal is to illustrate the variability and complexity involved in a real-world supply chain.

Here is a representative subset of the temporal profile for the given supply chain activities:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (1, 0.25),  # Supplier Selection followed by Order Placement
    ('OP', 'RC'): (30, 5),    # Order Placement followed by Receive Components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (1, 0.5),   # Receive Components followed by Quality Inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (2, 0.75),  # Quality Inspection followed by Component Assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (7, 1),     # Component Assembly followed by Product Testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (1, 0.25),  # Product Testing followed by Packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (1, 0.5),   # Packaging followed by Warehouse Storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (15, 2),    # Warehouse Storage followed by Distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (30, 5),    # Distribution followed by After-Sales Support
    ('SS', 'PT'): (38, 6),    # Supplier Selection followed by Product Testing
    ('SS', 'PK'): (39, 6.5),  # Supplier Selection followed by Packaging
    ('SS', 'WS'): (40, 7),    # Supplier Selection followed by Warehouse Storage
    ('SS', 'DT'): (60, 10),   # Supplier Selection followed by Distribution
    ('SS', 'AS'): (90, 15),   # Supplier Selection followed by After-Sales Support
}
```

In this example, the values are provided in days for simplicity, where `1` typically represents one day. For instance:

- The average time from `Supplier Selection` to `Order Placement` (`SS` to `OP`) is estimated to be 1 day with a standard deviation of 0.25 days.
- The average time from `Order Placement` to `Receive Components` (`OP` to `RC`) is estimated to be 30 days with a standard deviation of 5 days.
- The average time from `Supplier Selection` to `Product Testing` (`SS` to `PT`) is estimated to be 38 days with a standard deviation of 6 days, and so on.

The aim here is to demonstrate the variability and complexity in the timing of events across the supply chain, including indirect relationships between activities separated by multiple steps. The actual numerical values should be determined based on real data and operational insights for a practical application.
