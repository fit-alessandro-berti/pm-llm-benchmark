We need to output a Python dictionary mapping activity pairs (tuples) to (average_time, standard_deviation). Must not provide explicit numerical values? Actually prompt says "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." Wait: "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." I think they want us to output dictionary with estimated times but not give explicit numbers? That seems contradictory. Probably they want us to generate dictionary with placeholder values? Or maybe they want us to produce dictionary without specifying actual numbers (like "average_time" and "standard_deviation" as expressions)? But they ask "Produce a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile. ... assign an estimated average time and standard deviation." So we need to provide actual numbers? But earlier they say "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." Possibly they mean we should not give explicit numeric example in the prompt before generating dictionary; they want the LLM to generate the dictionary with estimated times. So we should output dictionary with actual numbers (estimated). But they also say "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt". That likely refers to the earlier instruction for the LLM not to include numbers in prompt? Actually the user is giving a scenario and asks us to produce dictionary. They say "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." This might be a meta instruction for the LLM: they want the LLM to not put numbers in the prompt text but just generate dictionary with estimated times. So we can output dictionary with numbers.

Thus we can create a dictionary mapping pairs like ('SS','OP'), ('OP','RC'), ('RC','QI'), ('QI','CA'), ('CA','PT'), ('PT','PK'), ('PK','WS'), ('WS','DT'), ('DT','AS'), also include non-direct pairs like ('SS','CA'), ('SS','PT'), ('OP','QI'), etc. Provide average_time and standard_deviation as plausible numbers (seconds maybe). Use realistic ranges: supplier selection maybe 86400 seconds (1 day) with stdev 7200; order placement maybe 172800 seconds (2 days) with stdev 14400; receive components maybe 43200 (12 hours) with stdev 7200; quality inspection maybe 21600 (6 hours) with stdev 3600; component assembly maybe 43200 (12 hours) with stdev 5400; product testing maybe 86400 (1 day) with stdev 10800; packaging maybe 7200 (2 hours) with stdev 1080; storage maybe 3600 (1 hour) with stdev 720; distribution maybe 129600 (3 days) with stdev 36000; after-sales support maybe 345600 (4 days) with stdev 21600.

Also include non-neighbor pairs with larger average times.

We'll output dictionary with keys as tuple of pair activities, values as tuple (avg, std). Use parentheses.

Let's craft about 15 pairs.

We'll ensure include pairs that are not directly connected but eventually following each other, like ('SS','CA'), ('SS','PT'), ('OP','QI'), ('OP','PK'), etc.

I'll produce dictionary with keys as ('A','B') strings? Use activity abbreviations: 'SS','OP','RC','QI','CA','PT','PK','WS','DT','AS'.

We'll map:

('SS','OP'): (86400, 7200)
('OP','RC'): (43200, 10800)
('RC','QI'): (21600, 3600)
('QI','CA'): (43200, 5400)
('CA','PT'): (86400, 10800)
('PT','PK'): (7200, 1080)
('PK','WS'): (3600, 720)
('WS','DT'): (129600, 36000)
('DT','AS'): (345600, 21600)

Add non-consecutive:

('SS','CA'): (259200, 36000) # SS->OP->RC->QI->CA approx 2.5 days? Actually we can compute sum but we can assign.

('SS','PT'): (388800, 43200)

('OP','QI'): (86400, 14400)

('OP','PK'): (108000, 18000)

('OP','WS'): (162000, 25200)

('RC','PK'): (108000, 18000)

('RC','WS'): (144000, 21600)

('QI','WS'): (129600, 18000)

('PT','WS'): (129600, 18000)

('DT','AS'): already included.

('SS','DT'): (216000, 36000)

('SS','AS'): (518400, 43200)

('DT','AS'): we have.

We need to ensure each key is a tuple.

Will produce dictionary literal.

I'll include a comment? Probably not.

Just output dictionary.

Let's produce final answer.
