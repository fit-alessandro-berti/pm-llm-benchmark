Based on the provided attributes, several could be considered sensitive for fairness concerns in the context of a rental application process:

* **`case:citizen`:**  Knowing whether a case is associated with a citizen or not could introduce bias against or in favor of specific groups of people.
* **`case:gender`:**  Using a person's gender as a factor in any decision-making process related to rentals is a direct violation of fair practices.
* **`case:german speaking`:**  This attribute could lead to bias in favor or against candidates based on their language skills.  It could be tied to immigration status or perceived socioeconomic status.
* **`case:married`:** This attribute could also be discriminatory as it can be associated with stereotypes and may correlate with other sensitive factors.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Correlation with other attributes:**  Even if an attribute, like `case:married`, appears innocuous in isolation, it may correlate with other sensitive attributes (e.g., `case:citizen`, `case:german speaking`). This means that using it in a model could indirectly discriminate against certain groups.
* **Context is crucial:** The specific application and how these attributes are used *within the process* needs to be carefully examined.  For example, if the data includes information indicating a preference to rent to married couples who are German speakers in particular locations, this would point to potential biases in the system.  If the attribute is included to simply identify a case load and not affect any decision-making criteria, it's less problematic.
* **Impact Assessment:**  A thorough impact assessment is required to determine the potential harms of using these attributes.  This requires analyzing how these attributes might disproportionately affect different groups.

**Attributes *not* necessarily sensitive (in this context):**

* **`concept:name`:**  While names could raise privacy concerns, it's unlikely that this data, on its own, is intended to introduce bias if de-identified.
* **`resource`:** While resource is meaningful, it's less immediately sensitive in terms of bias.  It could have indirect effects if there is a correlation between specific resource types and biases, but the key is how it's used.

**Recommendations:**

1. **De-identification:**  Wherever possible, de-identify or remove sensitive attributes from the data used to train models.
2. **Bias Mitigation Techniques:**  Use bias mitigation techniques during model training.
3. **Fairness Metrics:**  Measure the fairness of models using appropriate fairness metrics.
4. **Impact Assessment:**  Conduct a thorough impact assessment to identify and address potential discrimination risks.
5. **Transparency and Explainability:** Make sure any rental decision-making process is transparent and explainable. This helps stakeholders understand why a particular decision was made, allowing for accountability.

In summary, `case:citizen`, `case:gender`, `case:german speaking`, and `case:married`  should be treated with extreme caution, as their inclusion could result in unfair or discriminatory outcomes in the rental process.  A rigorous analysis of their use and potential correlations with other factors is essential.
