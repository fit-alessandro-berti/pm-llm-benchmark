The provided image visualizes the workflow and timeline for processing different types of orders, including Purchase Requisition Items, Sales Orders, and Purchase Orders.

For each order type, the process starts with a "Start" node and follows a sequence of steps with the time taken for each step indicated in milliseconds (ms).

The Purchase Requisition Item workflow involves creating the requisition, approving it, sending the order, checking stock, and either processing the return or approving payment before ending.

The Sales Order workflow is simpler, involving creating the order, packing the goods, shipping the goods, and confirming delivery before ending.

The Purchase Order workflow is the shortest, starting with creating the order, then closing it after a brief 180ms total duration.

The visualization uses a flowchart-like structure with nodes for each step and arrows showing the sequence and time durations. This allows comparing the relative complexity and time required for fulfilling the different order types in this system.
