To solve for a BPMN-like process model based on the provided interview transcripts, let us first identify the main activities, participants, decision points, and flow of events described.

### Important Activities/Tasks Mentioned:
1. **Receive Invoice (usually by email)**
2. **Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number on Invoice**
3. **If no PO, send back to supplier for more details**
4. **If there is a PO, log invoice into the accounting system**
5. **Forward invoice to purchasing department (to confirm goods/services received)**
6. **Wait for confirmation from the purchasing department**
7. **Match invoice line items against the PO in the system**
8. **If everything matches, send the invoice to the department manager for approval**
9. **If there is a discrepancy (incorrect pricing or missing items), email the purchasing team to clarify**
10. **If the discrepancy can’t be resolved easily, escalate to the AP supervisor (Rita)**
11. **Once manager approves, schedule the invoice for payment**
12. **Contact supplier directly if there’s a discrepancy (this could be done by the Purchasing Officer or Accounts Payable Supervisor or Supplier Relationship Manager)
13. **If there is no PO for some invoices (services contracted informally), work with department heads to create a retrospective PO or decide if the invoice should be rejected.

### Main Participants Mentioned:
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**

Based on the interviews, a structured BPMN-like process model can be described as follows:

1. **Start Event:** "Invoice Received" (usually by email)
    
2. **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk):** "Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number on Invoice"
    
3. **Gateway (Exclusive - XOR):** 
    - If "No PO Number on Invoice":
        - **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk):** "Send Back to Supplier for More Details" (which might involve looping until a valid PO is provided or until another action is taken such as creating a retrospective PO if no PO was initially issued).
    - If "Invoice has a PO Number":
        - **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk):** "Log Invoice into Accounting System"
        - **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk):** "Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department"
    
4. **Task (Purchasing Officer):** "Confirm Goods or Services Were Received"
    
5. **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk):** "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System"
    
6. **Gateway (Exclusive - XOR):**
    - If "Discrepancy Found" (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items):
        - **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk):** "Email Purchasing Team to Clarify"
        - *Further Gateway (Exclusive - XOR):*
            - If "Discrepancy Resolved":
                - Return to "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System" task until all issues are resolved.
            - If "Discrepancy Not Resolved Easily":
                - **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk):** "Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)"
                - **Task (Accounts Payable Supervisor):** "Handle Exception" (which might involve contacting suppliers, working with department heads to create a retrospective PO, or deciding if the invoice should be rejected)
                - Once resolved, return to "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System" task.
    - If "No Discrepancy" (everything matches):
        - **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk):** "Send to Department Manager for Approval"
    
7. **Task (Department Manager):** "Review Invoice Details and Approve"
    
8. **Gateway (Exclusive - XOR):**
    - If "Manager Approves":
        - **Task (Accounts Payable Clerk):** "Schedule Invoice for Payment"
    - If "Manager Rejects":
        - **Task (Department Manager):** "Reject Invoice" (which might require investigating further or holding the invoice until issues are resolved).
    
9. **End Event:** "Invoice Scheduled for Payment" (once all checks are completed and approval obtained).

### Textual BPMN-like Process Model Description

#### Start Event:
1. **Invoice Received (by email)**
    
#### Main Flow:
1. **Task: Check for Valid PO Number on Invoice (Accounts Payable Clerk)**
   - If no PO number:
       - **Task: Send Back to Supplier for More Details (Accounts Payable Clerk) (loop until valid PO is provided or another action is taken)**
   - If there is a PO number:
       - **Task: Log Invoice into Accounting System (Accounts Payable Clerk)**
       - **Task: Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department (Accounts Payable Clerk)**
    
2. **Task: Confirm Goods or Services Were Received (Purchasing Officer)**
    
3. **Task: Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in the System (Accounts Payable Clerk)**
   - If everything matches:
       - **Task: Send to Department Manager for Approval (Accounts Payable Clerk)**
   - If there is a discrepancy:
       - **Task: Email Purchasing Team to Clarify (Accounts Payable Clerk)**
       - If discrepancy resolved:
           - Return to "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System" task.
       - If discrepancy not resolved easily:
           - **Task: Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Accounts Payable Clerk)**
           - **Task: Handle Exception (Accounts Payable Supervisor)**
               - Possible actions include:
                   - Contacting suppliers.
                   - Coordinating between departments.
                   - Creating a retrospective PO for invoices without POs (for informally contracted services).
                   - Deciding if the invoice should be rejected.
           - Once resolved, return to "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System" task.

4. **Task: Review Invoice Details (Department Manager)**
   - If approved:
       - **Task: Schedule Invoice for Payment (Accounts Payable Clerk)**
   - If rejected:
       - **Task: Investigate Further (Department Manager or Accounts Payable Clerk)**
       - Loop back to "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System" if necessary.

#### End Event:
1. **Invoice Scheduled for Payment (End of Process)**

### Additional Notes:
1. The "Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)" participates only in resolving discrepancies where direct contact with suppliers is needed.
2. The "Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)" handles exception cases where the normal process flow encounters significant issues.
3. "Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor" and "Handle Exception" should be part of a sub-process for resolving complex discrepancies.
4. The "Contact Supplier" task might be done by the Purchasing Officer (Dan), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), or Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) depending on the nature of the issue.

This BPMN-like textual process model should provide a clear structure for someone to convert into a visual BPMN diagram while highlighting the main steps, decision points, and roles involved in the described invoice approval process.

BPMN-like Textual Process Model for Invoice Approval Process:

Start Event:
1. "Invoice Received" (usually by email).

Main Flow:
1. Task (Accounts Payable Clerk): "Check for Valid PO Number on Invoice."
    Exclusive Gateway (XOR):
    - If "No PO Number on Invoice":
        Task (Accounts Payable Clerk): "Send Back to Supplier for More Details."
        (Loop until valid PO is provided or another action is taken such as creating a retrospective PO if no PO was initially issued.)
    - If "Invoice has a PO Number":
        Task (Accounts Payable Clerk): "Log Invoice into Accounting System."
        Task (Accounts Payable Clerk): "Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department."

2. Task (Purchasing Officer): "Confirm Goods or Services Were Received."

3. Task (Accounts Payable Clerk): "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System."
    Exclusive Gateway (XOR):
    - If "Discrepancy Found" (e.g., incorrect pricing or missing items):
        Task (Accounts Payable Clerk): "Email Purchasing Team to Clarify."
        Another Exclusive Gateway (XOR):
            If "Discrepancy Resolved":
                Return to "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System" task.
            If "Discrepancy Not Resolved Easily":
                Task (Accounts Payable Clerk): "Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)."
                Task (Accounts Payable Supervisor): "Handle Exception."
                (Actions might include contacting suppliers, working with department heads to create a retrospective PO, or deciding if the invoice should be rejected.)
                Once resolved, return to "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System" task.
    - If "No Discrepancy" (everything matches):
        Task (Accounts Payable Clerk): "Send to Department Manager for Approval."

4. Task (Department Manager): "Review Invoice Details and Approve."
    Exclusive Gateway (XOR):
    - If "Manager Approves":
        Task (Accounts Payable Clerk): "Schedule Invoice for Payment."
        Proceed to End Event.
    - If "Manager Rejects":
        Task (Department Manager): "Reject Invoice."
        (This might require investigating further or holding the invoice until issues are resolved.)

End Event:
1. "Invoice Scheduled for Payment."
