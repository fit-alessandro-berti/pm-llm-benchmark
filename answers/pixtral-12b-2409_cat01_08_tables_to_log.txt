### Explanation:
1. **Case ID**: Each `order_id` is used as the unique identifier for the process instance.
2. **Activity Name**: Events are derived from key steps in the lifecycle of each order, such as "Order Created," "Items Picked," "Order Dispatched," "Order Arrived," "Invoice Issued," and "Payment Received."
3. **Timestamp**: Each event includes the relevant timestamp from the respective tables.
4. **Resource/Actor**: The resource or actor responsible for the event is included where available, such as salespersons, warehouse staff, carriers, and billing clerks.
5. **Other Attributes**: Additional relevant data is included, such as item details, invoice amounts, and delivery notes.

This event log captures the sequence of activities for each order, ensuring chronological correctness and providing a comprehensive view of the business process.
