### Case Evaluations

#### 1. Identifying Violations of Normative Rules

**Case 2:**
- **Violations:**
  - The **Risk Assessment** activity was performed before the **Credit Check**. This directly violates the normative ordering rule that requires the credit check to be completed prior to the risk assessment.
  - After deciding to **reject** the loan, the documentation was **finalized** before closing the case. This is a violation of the rule that specifies documentation should not be finalized if the loan is rejected.
  
**Summary for Case 2:**
- **Violating Normative Rules:** Yes
- **Reasons for Violation:** Sequence of activities was not followed, and actions taken were contradictory to the established rules.

#### 2. Identifying Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions

**Case 3:**
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - The **Credit Check** was performed **more than 24 hours** after the application was received. This delays the credit check, which is recommended to occur within 24 hours after application receipt.
  - The time taken to **inform the applicant** after the loan decision was made (more than 48 hours) is longer than the recommended timeframe.
  - There was **no Follow-up Call** made before closing the case, which is suggested to ensure alignment.

**Summary for Case 3:**
- **Meeting Desiderata Conditions:** No
- **Reasons for Violations:** Although the normative rules were adhered to, the timing and follow-up practices suggested as best practices were not followed.

### Observations and Justifications

- **Case 1** follows all normative and desiderata conditions without any violations or suboptimal behaviors. This example illustrates the ideal process for handling a loan application.

- The observed behaviors in **Case 2** highlight a significant breakdown in following the strict rules governing the loan application process. This indicates either miscommunication or lack of understanding of the process requirements among the staff involved.

- The delays noted in **Case 3** could be indicative of operational inefficiencies or staffing issues that may have impacted the ability to expedite the credit check and inform the applicant in a timely manner. 

- The absence of a follow-up call, while not strictly mandated, reflects a possible oversight in communication strategy and customer engagement practices that could enhance the applicant's experience.

### Recommendations

- **For Case 2:** Immediate retraining on process adherence is essential to prevent such significant violations. Ensure staff comprehensively understand the required sequence to avoid future missteps. 

- **For Case 3:** Evaluate the team's workload and operational processes responsible for timely credit checks and communication. Encourage staff to integrate follow-up calls as a standard process to enhance client engagement, even if not strictly required.

In summary, while cases can deviate from normative rules with serious implications, optimally meeting the recommended best practices (desiderata) is crucial for efficiency and client satisfaction in the loan application process.
