### Part 1: Identification of Normative Rule Violations

#### **Case ID 2:**
- **Violation Details:**
  - **Activity Order Violation:** The log shows that the "Risk Assessment" was conducted before the "Credit Check." This is a direct violation of the normative rule that states that a Credit Check must be completed before any risk evaluation is conducted.
  - **Inappropriate Action After Rejection:** The log indicates that after the loan decision was made (Rejected), there was an attempt to "Finalize Documentation." This contradicts the rule that documentation should not be finalized following a loan rejection. 

**Summary:** Case 2 violates the normative rules by doing Risk Assessment out of order and trying to finalize documentation after rejection.

#### **Case ID 3:**
- **No direct normative violations** are present in Case 3. All processes adhere to the defined strict sequence of activities; however, the timings raised in Part 2 clarify desirability.

### Part 2: Identification of Desiderata Violations

#### **Case ID 2:**
- This case violates several normative rules, which have been previously outlined, thus it doesn’t require any additional evaluation regarding desirata.

#### **Case ID 3:**
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - **Delayed Credit Check:** The "Credit Check" was conducted 2 days (48 hours) after the application was received, which is beyond the recommended 24-hour window.
  - **Late Applicant Notification:** The "Inform Applicant" activity was performed 2 days (48 hours) after the loan decision was made, violating the recommended timeframe to inform within 48 hours post-decision.
  - **Missing Follow-up Call:** There was no "Follow-up Call" after the Loan Decision, which is encouraged but not strictly required.

**Summary:** While Case 3 adheres to normative rules, it represents suboptimal behavior by not meeting the recommended timeframes for Credit Check completion and applicant notification, and it also lacks a follow-up call.

### Justifications for Behaviors in Alignment with Constraints and Recommendations

1. **Case ID 2 Justification:**
   - The behavior in Case 2 suggests a possible oversight in applying the rules, potentially indicating a training issue or a misunderstanding of the process flow among staff. Such errors can often arise in environments with high volumes of applications, leading to lapses in procedural adherence.

2. **Case ID 3 Justification:**
   - For Case 3, while the Credit Check delayed more than 24 hours, it could be argued that operational bottlenecks or a high application volume contributed to the delay. Such situations occur when processing teams are inundated, where completing assessments promptly can understandably be challenging.
   - The delay in notifying the applicant could similarly be attributed to resource constraints, where ensuring timely communication may be impacted by workload or other operational factors. Additionally, the absence of a follow-up call may be due to prioritization of closing cases over supplementary communication, especially if staff are under pressure to process high quantities of applications.

In conclusion, while normative rules in Cases 2 and 3 were broken in different ways, identifying the origins of these aberrations is vital for fostering improved compliance and enhancing the overall processing experience.
