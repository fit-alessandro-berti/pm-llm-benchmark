The two logs differ in one crucial respect: only the “unprotected” cases ever pick up a positive ScoreAdjustment (+10) by virtue of being LocalResidents and belonging to a CommunityGroup.  No such adjustment ever shows up in the protectedgroup log.  That skew in turn drives who ultimately gets approved:

1.  ScoreAdjustment policy  
   – In Group B (Unprotected), every case with LocalResident=TRUE and a nonNone CommunityGroup picks up +10 points in both PreliminaryScoring and at ManualReview.  
   – In Group A (Protected), LocalResident is always FALSE (so “no boost”) and CommunityGroup is always None, and ScoreAdjustment remains 0 throughout.

2.  Impact on final scores and decisions  
   – U003 starts with a raw 695 (below any plausible approval threshold), but the +10 boost takes it to 705 and it is Approved.  
   – By contrast P002 starts at 710 (well above 695) but gets no boost and is Rejected.  
   – Even when raw scores tie (P001 vs. U001 both raw 720), only the unprotected U001 gains +10 and ends up with 730—yet both P001 and U001 are Approved in this small sample.  The real smoking gun is that boosts allow unprotected applicants to succeed on weaker raw merits.

3.  How the bias manifests  
   – Systematic advantage to unprotected locals in community groups: they get a builtin “community” bonus.  
   – Protected applicants (nonlocal, no community tag) never see that bonus, no matter how similar their raw profiles.  
   – Downstream rules (the Rules Engine) simply acts on the adjusted score, so any early favoritism completely skews the final tally.

In short, the algorithmic pipeline is biased in favor of the unprotected group by selectively applying a +10 “Community Boost.”  Identical or weaker raw scores in Group B can translate into approvals that Group A applicants, lacking the same treatment, never receive.
