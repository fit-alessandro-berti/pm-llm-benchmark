Upon analyzing the data provided, some notable differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group can be identified:

1. Frequency: The protected group has significantly fewer occurrences in their process variants compared to the unprotected group. For example, the most frequent process variant in the protected group has a frequency of 960, while the most frequent process variant in the unprotected group has a frequency of 2709.
2. Complexity: The process variants in the protected group are generally more complicated and involve more steps compared to the process variants in the unprotected group. For instance, some process variants for the protected group involve multiple visits for collateral assessment, while the unprotected group typically has a simpler process.
3. Time: The protected group has a longer average performance time compared to the unprotected group. The average performance time for the protected group is 219999.156, while the average performance time for the unprotected group is 340005.309. This suggests that the processes for the protected group take more time to complete.
4. Rejection Rates: The protected group seems to have a higher rejection rate compared to the unprotected group. Many process variants in the protected group end with loan rejections, while the unprotected group has more process variants that result in loan agreements being signed.

Based on these observations, the main differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group are the frequency, complexity, time taken, and rejection rates. The protected group appears to experience more rejections, and the processes are generally more complex and take longer.
