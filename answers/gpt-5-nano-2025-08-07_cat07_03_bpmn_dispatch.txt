This is a crossfunctional process flow (a BPMNstyle diagram) that shows the endtoend process of processing a customer order and shipping the goods. It is drawn as swimlanes that represent different roles/ departments (e.g., Logistics/Dispatcher, Warehouse, Secretary), with tasks, decisions, and flow lines connecting them.

Key elements and flow:
- Start with “Ship goods” and the order details.
- Clarify the shipment method and check for special handling.
- If insurance is required, insure the parcel; otherwise write the package label. There is a decision point about insurance.
- If insurance is involved, there’s a followup decision/flow to insure and then proceed to labeling.
- A parallel path shows getting three offers from logistics companies and then selecting a logistics provider and placing the order.
- The process culminates in packing the goods in the warehouse (noted as taking about 48 hours), filling out shipment paperwork, and moving the package to the pickup area.
- Finally, the shipment is marked as prepared.

Overall, it maps responsibilities across departments and highlights decision points (insurance, special handling, choosing a carrier) and the sequential/parallel steps to get a shipment ready. If you’d like, I can extract a stepbystep list or convert it into a BPMN/XML representation.
