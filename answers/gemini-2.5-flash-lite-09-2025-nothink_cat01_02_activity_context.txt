This analysis focuses on disambiguating activities that appear more than once within the same support case (C001, C002, and C003).

## 1. Identification and Interpretation of Recurring Activities

The following activities recur across the cases:

| Activity Name | Occurrences & Contextual Differences |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Verify Documents** | Occurs multiple times in C001 and C003. The first instance is usually the initial check. Subsequent instances are specific re-verifications after an external event (like receiving missing documents or after an account adjustment). |
| **Call Customer** | Occurs multiple times in C001, C002, and C003. The first call often seeks *missing information* or *clarification*. Subsequent calls might be *follow-ups* to confirm internal system changes or procedural actions. |
| **Adjust Account** | Occurs in C002 and C003. While it only appears once per case in this sample, it is a key contextual step following a customer interaction (like a clarification call), often preceding a final verification step. (It's noted here as a critical context setter, even if not strictly recurring in the same way as the others.) |

## 2. Renaming Strategy

The goal is to use suffixes or prefixes that capture the *reason* or *sequence* of the activity.

| Original Activity | Contextual Instance | Suggested New Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Verify Documents** | Initial check/Standard verification | `Verify Documents - Initial Check` |
| **Verify Documents** | Re-verification after customer provided input (C001) or after an internal correction (C003) | `Verify Documents - Re-check` |
| **Call Customer** | Initial contact to request information or clarify an issue. | `Call Customer - Information Request` |
| **Call Customer** | Subsequent contact to confirm internal system changes. | `Call Customer - Follow-up Confirmation` |
| **Call Customer** | Contact related to procedural status (Customer stepped out). | `Call Customer - Status Update` |
| **Adjust Account** | Internal change based on prior interaction. | `Adjust Account - Internal Correction` |

## 4. Justification for Naming Choices

| Original Activity | Renamed Activity(s) | Contextual Clue for Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Verify Documents** | `Verify Documents - Initial Check` / `Verify Documents - Re-check` | The first occurrence is the standard, initial attempt. Subsequent occurrences happen *after* an external factor (new document submission or an internal adjustment), indicating a subsequent, conditional check rather than the first one. |
| **Call Customer** | `Call Customer - Information Request` / `Call Customer - Follow-up Confirmation` / `Call Customer - Status Update` | The purpose of the call changes. The initial call (C001, C002) is proactive to get missing data. The second call in C002 is explicitly a *follow-up* to confirm an internal action (`Adjust Account`). The C003 call is unique, relating to the customer's *physical presence* rather than data missingness. |
| **Adjust Account** | `Adjust Account - Internal Correction` | Although not recurring in this small sample, naming this step clarifies that this action is an **internal system adjustment**, usually triggered by information gathered during the preceding customer interaction, setting up the need for a final re-verification. |
