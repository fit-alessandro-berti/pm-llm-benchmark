Let's analyze each case carefully based on the **normative constraints** (hard rules) and **desiderata** (recommended but not strictly required).

---

## 1. Normative Rule Violations

### Case 1
| Activity | Order Check & Comments |
|-|-|
| Application Received | Correct start |
| Credit Check | Happens after application received - correct |
| Risk Assessment | Happens after credit check - correct |
| Loan Decision (Approved) | After risk assessment - correct |
| Inform Applicant | After loan decision - correct |
| Finalize Documentation | Allowed only if loan approved; here loan is approved, so correct |
| Close Case | After finalizing documentation - correct |

**Verdict:** No normative violations in Case 1.

---

### Case 2  
| Activity | Issue? |
|-|-|
| Application Received | Correct start |
| Risk Assessment | Occurs **before** Credit Check - **Normative violation** (credit check must happen first) |
| Credit Check | Out of order, after Risk Assessment |
| Loan Decision (Rejected) | Correct order |
| Finalize Documentation | **Not allowed after rejection** - normative violation |
| Close Case | Correct placement |

**Normative violations in Case 2:**  
- Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check (order violation).  
- Finalize Documentation done after rejection (not allowed).

---

### Case 3  
| Activity | Issue? |
|-|-|
| Application Received | Correct start |
| Credit Check | After application received - good order |
| Risk Assessment | After Credit Check - good order |
| Loan Decision (Approved) | After Risk Assessment - good order |
| Inform Applicant | After Loan Decision - good order |
| Finalize Documentation | After Loan Decision, since approved - good order |
| Close Case | After Finalize Documentation - correct order |

**Verdict:** No normative violations. All activities are done in correct sequence and with proper conditions.

## 2. Desiderata (Recommended but not strict) Violations

### Case 1  
- Credit Check completed within 24 hours?  
  - Application at 09:00, Credit Check at 09:30  within 24 hours, good.  
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision?  
  - Loan Decision at 11:00, Inform Applicant at 13:00  within 48 hours, good.  
- Follow-up Call before Close Case?  
  - No follow-up call listed  desideratum violated (recommended but not mandatory).

### Case 2  
- Credit Check within 24 hours?  
  - Application at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00  within 24 hours, good.  
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours?  
  - Inform Applicant step not explicitly listed (only Loan Decision, then Finalize Documentation, no Inform Applicant)  missing Inform Applicant activity?  
  - Actually, no Inform Applicant event is recorded  missing step (normative violation if mandatory)  
- Follow-up Call before Close Case?  
  - No follow-up call  desideratum violated

### Case 3  
- Credit Check within 24 hours?  
  - Application at Jan 12 09:00, Credit Check at Jan 14 10:00 (more than 48 hours!)  *desideratum violation*  
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours?  
  - Loan Decision Jan 14 12:00, Inform Applicant Jan 16 15:00 (~51 hours later, more than 48 hours)  *desideratum violation*  
- Follow-up Call before Close Case?  
  - None listed  *desideratum violated*

## 3. Interpretations and Justifications

- **Case 1:** Strictly compliant with all normative rules and close adherence to desiderata, except for lack of follow-up call which is recommended only.
  
- **Case 2:**
  - Normative violations suggest process errors or mismanagement:  
    - Risk Assessment performed prematurely, indicating possible confusion or missing information.  
    - Finalize Documentation after rejection suggests error (e.g., staff misunderstanding when to finalize docs or system glitch).  
  - Missing Inform Applicant step could be another oversight or incorrectly logged in the log.  
  - Lack of follow-up call is acceptable as it's recommended only.

- **Case 3:**
  - No normative violations, process steps in correct order and conditions respected.  
  - Delays in performing Credit Check and Inform Applicant activities may be due to workload or backlog — these delays are undesirable but not forbidden.  
  - No follow-up call may reflect resource constraints or prioritization decisions, but it's best practice to have it.

# **Summary**

| Case | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Violations | Explanation / Notes |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | None | Missing Follow-up Call | Process executed correctly; follow-up call missing but not mandatory |
| 2 | Yes (order violation and finalize after rejection) | Missing Inform Applicant, No Follow-up Call | Process steps out of order; contradictory actions performed; missing notifications; follow-up call skipped |
| 3 | None | Credit Check & Inform Applicant late; No Follow-up Call | Process order respected; delays occur in timing of key steps; recommended follow-up call missing |
