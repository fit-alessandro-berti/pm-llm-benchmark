Based on the normative process description, I'll analyze each case to identify violations:

## Case 1:  Compliant
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

This case follows the expected flow perfectly for sufficient inventory scenario. No violations detected.

## Case 2:  Violates Process
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"
- The normative description explicitly states: "Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping
- This case packages items at 10:00 but doesn't authorize payment until 10:30
- This violates the logical flow where payment must be confirmed before preparing items for shipment

## Case 3:  Multiple Violations
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **Illogical flow combination:** The case includes both fulfillment activities (Authorize payment) and cancellation
   - Once inventory is checked, the process should either proceed to fulfillment OR cancellation, not both
   - Authorizing payment followed by cancellation suggests conflicting decisions

2. **Ship after Cancel:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"
   - The description explicitly states: "Ship order" should never occur after a cancellation
   - It's illogical to ship an order that has been canceled
   - The description notes that after cancellation, no fulfillment activities (packaging/shipping) should occur

## Case 4:  Compliant
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

This case follows the expected flow for insufficient inventory scenario. The short sequence (Receive  Check  Cancel  Close) is exactly as described for cancellation cases.

## Case 5:  Violates Process
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** Missing "Package items" activity
- The normative description indicates that items must be packaged before shipping
- This case jumps directly from payment authorization to shipping at 11:00, skipping the packaging step
- The description states "Package items" should occur after authorization and before shipping

## Summary:
- **Compliant cases:** 1, 4
- **Non-compliant cases:** 2, 3, 5
- **Most severe violation:** Case 3 (combines cancellation with fulfillment activities and ships after cancellation)
- **Most common violation type:** Incorrect sequencing of fulfillment activities (Cases 2 and 5)
