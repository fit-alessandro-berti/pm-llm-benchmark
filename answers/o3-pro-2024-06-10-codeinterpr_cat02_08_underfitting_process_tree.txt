1. One concrete trace that can be replayed by the process-tree but is forbidden from a business point of view is  

   Receive_Order    Check_Inventory    Ship_Order    Authorize_Payment    Package_Items    Close_Order

2. Why this trace is wrong although the model accepts it:

   • In the business reality of an Order-to-Cash process the order may only be shipped after (a) the customer’s payment has been authorised and (b) the items have been packed.  
   • In the given tree the three activities Authorize_Payment, Package_Items and Ship_Order are placed under a PARALLEL () operator.  
     – A PARALLEL node obliges the model to execute all its children exactly once, but it puts no ordering constraints on them; they can occur in any order or even be interleaved.  
     – Therefore the trace above, in which Ship_Order happens first and the payment authorisation and the packaging are done afterwards, is still perfectly “fitting” for the model.  
   • From a domain perspective the trace is invalid because it would mean goods were dispatched before payment was secured and before they were even packed, which clearly violates the mandatory business rules for Order-to-Cash.

(Additional, also-possible anomaly: if the XOR branch “cancel order” is chosen, the tree produces two consecutive Close_Order events – Cancel_Order  Close_Order inside the branch and a second Close_Order that sits after the XOR – but one Close_Order should be enough. This shows the same under-constraining problem of the model.)
