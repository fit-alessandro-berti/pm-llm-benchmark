1. Which cases take unusually long?

Estimated total ticket-life (first to last time-stamp)

• Case 103 –  1 h 20 min  
• Case 101 –  2 h 15 min  
• Case 102 –  25 h 10 min  
• Case 104 –  24 h 10 min  
• Case 105 –  49 h 05 min  

Using the “quick” cases 101 & 103 as a baseline ( 1–2 h), anything above, say, 8 h is an outlier.  
=> Cases 102, 104 and 105 are the clear long-runners; 105 is extreme.

2. What patterns drive the long cycle times?

a. Escalation to Level-2  
   • Appears only in cases 102 & 105 – both long.  
   • Waiting time after escalation until the L2 team starts work is high:  
     – Case 102: 11:30  14:00 (2 h 30 min)  
     – Case 105: 10:00 (1 Mar)  14:00 (2 Mar) ( 28 h!)  
   • Once L2 finishes investigating, another long wait precedes “Resolve Ticket” (19 h in both 102 & 105).  
    Escalation queue and/or hand-off back to L1 is a major bottleneck.

b. Long gap between “Assign to Level-1 Agent” and “Investigate Issue”  
   • Case 104: 09:30  13:00 (3 h 30 min)  
   • No escalation, yet total cycle rises to a full day mainly because the first investigation starts late; the overnight pause before “Resolve Ticket” adds another 19 h.

c. Overnight/next-day completion of “Resolve Ticket”  
   • In all three slow cases the ticket sits untouched overnight after the first investigation.  
   • Indicates that agents stop work near end-of-shift instead of finishing or that they wait for customer confirmation or a 3rd-party fix.

d. Triage is not the culprit  
   • Triage times vary by only 10–40 min and show no correlation with total duration.

3. Why these factors inflate cycle time & how to address them

Factor 1 – Escalation delays  
• Each hand-off introduces a queue and context-switch.  
• Long waits (especially 28 h in case 105) suggest limited L2 capacity or unclear ownership after escalation.  
Recommendations:  
  – Add/redistribute L2 staffing during peak hours.  
  – Define an SLA for “time-to-first-touch” after escalation (e.g., 2 h).  
  – Enable “swarming” or real-time consultation so L1 can solve more issues without formal escalation.  
  – Provide clearer ownership rules: the ticket stays with L2 until resolved.

Factor 2 – Late start of investigation  
• Idle time between assignment and investigation (3 h) shows workload imbalance or ticket batching.  
Recommendations:  
  – Introduce work-in-progress limits per agent.  
  – Use skill-based routing to assign only when an agent is actually ready.  
  – Monitor “assignment-to-investigation” lag as a KPI.

Factor 3 – Overnight waiting before resolution/closure  
• If investigation ends near shift change, tickets wait ~19 h for the next step.  
Recommendations:  
  – Schedule hand-offs earlier in the day or enable shift overlap so another agent can finish the ticket the same day.  
  – For tasks awaiting external input, send automated reminders and mark them “waiting for customer” to exclude them from internal SLA calculations.

Factor 4 – Multiple investigations on the same ticket (case 105)  
• Re-investigation after escalation shows information loss at hand-off.  
Recommendations:  
  – Capture investigation notes in a template that travels with the ticket.  
  – Encourage joint L1-L2 sessions instead of restarting analysis.

Overall insight  
Escalations combined with idle gaps around shift boundaries are the dominant drivers of the long cycle times. Reducing escalation queue length, smoothing workload across shifts, and improving knowledge transfer at hand-offs should bring the long cases back in line with the fast 1–2 hour resolution benchmark.
