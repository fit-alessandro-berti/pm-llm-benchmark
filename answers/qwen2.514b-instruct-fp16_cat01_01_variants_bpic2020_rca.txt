From the provided data, we can identify several root cause scenarios contributing to poor performance within the declaration approval process:

### 1. **Multiple Rejection Scenarios:**
   - **High Frequency of Rejections:**
     Several sequences show high frequencies where declarations are rejected multiple times before finally being submitted again or approved:
       - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE ( frequency = 8)`
       - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 7)`

   **Analysis:**
     - Each rejection leads to additional steps, including resubmissions and possibly more reviews, which significantly extend the process time.

### 2. **Sequential Rejections After Multiple Approvals:**
   - Sequences where declarations are approved by one or more stakeholders but ultimately rejected later:
       - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 6)`
       - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 7)`

   **Analysis:**
     - After multiple approvals, rejections occur, leading to more processing delays and additional steps.

### 3. **Rejection by Administration Early in the Process:**
   - High rejection rates early on from the administration:
       - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION (frequency = 5)`
   
   **Analysis:**
     - Rejections at this stage halt the entire process and require significant rework, increasing overall cycle time.

### 4. **Rejection by Pre-Approver:**
   - Sequences where declarations are rejected early by pre-approvers:
       - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER (frequency = 8)`

   **Analysis:**
     - Rejections at this stage require the employee to start over or correct issues before resubmission, leading to delays.

### 5. **Complexity in Resubmission and Approval Steps:**
   - Scenarios where declarations are rejected multiple times and then successfully submitted after corrections:
       - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 6)`
       - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 8)`

   **Analysis:**
     - These sequences involve numerous steps of rework and resubmission, contributing significantly to performance degradation.

### Recommendations:
1. **Improve Initial Quality Control:**
   - Ensure that initial declarations are as accurate as possible to reduce the likelihood of early-stage rejections.
2. **Streamline Rejection Handling:**
   - Provide clear feedback at each rejection stage so employees can quickly correct issues and resubmit successfully.
3. **Optimize Approval Workflow:**
   - Identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in approval processes that lead to subsequent rejections.
4. **Enhance Pre-Approval Steps:**
   - Strengthen pre-approval mechanisms to catch more errors early, reducing the need for multiple submissions and approvals.

By addressing these specific root causes, you can improve the overall performance and efficiency of the declaration process.
