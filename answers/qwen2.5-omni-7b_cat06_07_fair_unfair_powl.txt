### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = SilentTransition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for data completeness
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[receive_application, request_more_info])

# Define XOR branching for cultural fit check
xor_cultural_fit = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_check, community_affiliation_check])

# Define sequence of steps
sequence_steps = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.SEQ, children=[
    skill_assessment,
    xor_cultural_fit,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Combine loop and XOR branching into a single POWL model
model_with_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop_data_completeness, xor_cultural_fit, sequence_steps])
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = SilentTransition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for data completeness
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[receive_application, request_more_info])

# Define sequence of steps without XOR branching
sequence_steps = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.SEQ, children=[
    skill_assessment,
    cultural_fit_check,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Combine loop and sequence steps into a single POWL model
model_without_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop_data_completeness, sequence_steps])
```

These two models represent the hiring process described, with the first model including the potential unfairness due to the XOR branching that provides a subtle advantage based on community affiliations, and the second model ensuring fairness by eliminating any such branching.
