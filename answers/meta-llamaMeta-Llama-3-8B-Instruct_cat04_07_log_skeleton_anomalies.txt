What a delightfully long list of constraints!

After reviewing the constraints, I've spotted some anomalies and potential issues in the proposed process model:

1. **Circular dependency**: The model has many circular dependencies, where an activity A can be triggered by an activity B, and activity B can be triggered by activity A. This can lead to infinite loops or inconsistent behavior. For example:
	* Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER can be triggered by Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, and vice versa.
	* Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR can be triggered by Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER, and vice versa.
2. **Conflicting constraints**: Some constraints contradict each other or are unclear. For example:
	* Equivalence: ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING') implies that the two activities are interchangeable, but Directly-Follows Constraints: ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING') suggests that the second activity only occurs immediately after the first.
	* Activity Occurrences: Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR has an upper bound of 1, yet it can be triggered repeatedly based on the Equivalence constraints.
3. **Inconsistent OCR bounds**: Some activities have inconsistent bounds or no bounds specified. For example:
	* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; and yet, it can be triggered multiple times based on the Equivalence constraints.
4. **Potential deadlocks**: The model might create deadlocks due to the numerous Never-Together constraints. For example:
	* ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE') and ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE') can create a deadlock.

Please review and refine the process model to address these issues. Consider simplifying the model, clarifying constraints, and ensuring that there are no circular dependencies, conflicting constraints, or deadlocks.
