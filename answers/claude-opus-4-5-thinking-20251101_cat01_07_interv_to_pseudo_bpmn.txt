## 6. Ambiguities and Uncertainties Noted

| Item | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Rework loop timing** | Unclear how long the process waits for supplier to send corrected invoice after return | Mary, Dan |
| **Escalation criteria** | "Cannot be resolved easily" is subjective; no specific criteria defined | Mary |
| **Retrospective PO authority** | Unclear who specifically authorizes creation of retrospective PO | Rita |
| **Manager rejection frequency** | Occurs "once every couple of months" - may need formal exception path | Carlos |
| **Karen's involvement trigger** | Exact conditions for involving Supplier Relationship Manager not explicit | Karen |
| **System automation scope** | Only manager notification explicitly mentioned as automated; other steps may also be system-triggered | Mary, Carlos |
