Based on the provided data, it appears that a series of operations related to shipping and logistics are being tracked in terms of sequence and their timing. The data can be parsed into several key operations and relationships between them:

### Key Operations:
1. **Register Customer Order**: This initiates the process with creation of a transport document.
2. **Create Transport Document**: After the customer order is registered, this operation creates the necessary transport documents (likely picking up details, destinations, etc.) for handling the shipment.
3. **Book Vehicles** & **Order Empty Containers**: These steps are part of preparing to ship goods and include reserving vehicles or containers needed for transportation.
4. **Depart**: This represents the actual departure of a vehicle carrying the container with shipped items.
5. **Reschedule Container**: If there is any delay, this operation could be used to re-schedule a container either before or after it has departed.

### Sequence and Timing:
- The process starts with registering the customer order, which initiates the entire logistical journey (indicated by high frequency of subsequent events).
- Creating transport documents follows shortly thereafter, likely providing necessary details for logistics.
- Booking vehicles and ordering empty containers are sequential steps in the preparation phase, typically taking significant time to arrange.
- The **Depart** event signifies that the actual shipment has begun, marking a transition from preparation to execution.
- There's also a **Reschedule Container** step used when delays or other issues necessitate changing departure plans.

### Timing Analysis:
The durations given provide insight into how long each phase takes:
- "Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document": Occurs at the highest frequency with significant time (329,005.22 seconds), suggesting a bottleneck early in the process.
- Steps involving **Book Vehicles**, **Order Empty Containers**, and the various departure states are also lengthy, indicating substantial preparation periods before shipment can occur.

### Summary:
The data indicates that customer orders lead to comprehensive logistics planning with multiple steps: order registration triggering document creation; booking vehicles or containers; preparing for shipping (likely waiting times); and finally the departure of vehicles. Each step seems to be an individual phase in a broader logistical process, with significant time investments at key points like document creation and preparation stages.

This structure highlights the need for efficient scheduling and coordination across multiple phases of logistics operations, including pre-departure planning and actual shipment execution.
