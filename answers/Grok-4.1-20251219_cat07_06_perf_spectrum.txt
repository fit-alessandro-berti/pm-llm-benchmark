This visualization is an **alluvial diagram** (also known as a parallel sets plot or a variant of a Sankey diagram), commonly used to show flows, changes, or distributions across categorical stages, often over time or through a process.

### Key Elements
- **Vertical axes (stages)**: There are three main categorical stages represented from top to bottom:
  1. **Send Fine** (top): The initial action of issuing or sending a fine/penalty.
  2. **Insert Fine Notification** (middle): A subsequent step, likely recording, notifying, or processing the fine in a system.
  3. **Send for Credit Collection** (bottom): The final escalation step, referring the unpaid fine to a credit collection agency or process (e.g., for debt recovery, impacting credit scores).

- **Flows (colored bands/lines)**: The curved, varying-width bands represent groups of individual cases (fines issued to people or entities). 
  - The **width** of each band is proportional to the number/volume of cases in that flow.
  - Bands are colored on a gradient: darker gray at the top, transitioning to lighter gray/pink, and redder tones toward the bottom (with some prominent red bands).

- **Time axis (bottom)**: The x-axis shows a timeline from January 25, 2000 (left) to April 24, 2013 (right), with a midpoint around September 9, 2006. The flows are spread horizontally across this period, indicating when cases occurred or progressed.

### What It Shows
This diagram tracks the **progression of fines through an enforcement or debt collection process over time**:
- All cases start at "Send Fine" (thick, uniform dark band at the top, representing a large volume of fines issued across the period).
- They then flow to "Insert Fine Notification" (middle), where the band fans out slightly, showing some variation in processing.
- Finally, a portion diverges downward to "Send for Credit Collection" (bottom), while others appear to remain or fade out (possibly indicating paid fines, resolutions, or cases that didn't escalate).

The **converging/funneling effect** toward the bottom right, with prominent red bands, highlights that **only a subset of fines escalate to credit collection**, and this subset is smaller than the total issued. The red coloring likely emphasizes these escalated (unpaid or problematic) cases, making them stand out against the gray (perhaps paid or resolved) ones.

### Likely Context
This appears to depict a **fine enforcement pipeline**, such as traffic fines, administrative penalties, or governmental debts (e.g., in a country like the Netherlands or similar, where "fine notification" is a common term in penalty systems). It illustrates:
- High volume of fines sent initially.
- Most go through notification.
- A decreasing proportion reach aggressive collection, possibly showing efficiency improvements, better payment rates over time, or policy changes reducing escalations.

The change in behavior around the mid-2000s (where flows start diverging more noticeably) might reflect a system or policy shift affecting how fines were handled.

Overall, the visualization effectively demonstrates that while many fines are issued, far fewer end up in formal credit collection—visually emphasizing the "filtering" effect of the process.
