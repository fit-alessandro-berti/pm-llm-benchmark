# Manufacturing Process Event Log Aggregation Analysis

## 1. Identified High-Level Steps

Based on the event log analysis, I propose the following five high-level process steps:

| High-Level Step | Sequence | Events Included | Duration (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Material Preparation & Setup** | 1 | Retrieve, Scan, Place, Align, Preheat | ~1 minute |
| **Welding & Assembly** | 2 | Pick tool, Weld corners A & B | ~20 seconds |
| **Quality Inspection (In-Process)** | 3 | Measure weld integrity | ~10 seconds |
| **Finishing & Protection** | 4 | Apply coating, Dry coating | ~45 seconds |
| **Final Quality Verification** | 5 | Visual check | ~15 seconds |

## 2. Detailed Grouping Justification

### **Step 1: Material Preparation & Setup**
**Low-level events grouped:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
- **Logical sequence:** These events form a coherent workflow where the raw material is identified, positioned, and prepared for processing.
- **Temporal proximity:** All events occur within ~15-20 seconds per case.
- **Resource coordination:** Mix of manual operator actions (retrieval, scanning, placement) followed by automated preparation (alignment, preheating).
- **Semantic cohesion:** All activities are prerequisites before active manufacturing begins; they represent the "setup" or "staging" phase.
- **State transition:** The material transitions from raw inventory to a prepared, ready-to-process state.

---

### **Step 2: Welding & Assembly**
**Low-level events grouped:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
- **Logical sequence:** Tool acquisition is immediately followed by its use; all represent the active assembly/joining phase.
- **Resource consistency:** All performed by Operator B (skilled welding operator), indicating a specialized task.
- **Temporal clustering:** Events occur within ~15 seconds, representing a continuous work session.
- **Process function:** These events represent the core value-adding manufacturing step where components are joined together.
- **Dependency:** Picking up the tool is a prerequisite for welding; the two corner welds are sequential applications of the same process.

---

### **Step 3: Quality Inspection (In-Process)**
**Low-level events grouped:**
- Measure weld integrity

**Rationale:**
- **Logical separation:** This is a distinct quality checkpoint immediately after welding.
- **Resource type:** Automated Quality Sensor performs independent verification (not operator-dependent).
- **Process gate:** This is a critical control point that validates the welding phase before proceeding to finishing.
- **Temporal marker:** Occurs after welding (~10 seconds post-weld), signifying end of assembly phase.
- **Modularity:** While technically a single event, it represents a distinct quality assurance function and merits its own process step for traceability.

---

### **Step 4: Finishing & Protection**
**Low-level events grouped:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:**
- **Logical sequence:** Coating application is immediately followed by the required drying step; together they represent a single finishing operation.
- **Resource coordination:** Coating Unit and Heating Unit work in tandem—one applies, one cures.
- **Temporal proximity:** Events occur within ~45 seconds with no other activities between them.
- **Functional unity:** Both activities are part of the "finishing" phase aimed at protecting the welded assembly.
- **Process dependency:** Drying cannot occur without prior coating application.
- **State transition:** The product transitions from bare metal to protected/finished state.

---

### **Step 5: Final Quality Verification**
**Low-level events grouped:**
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
- **Process gate:** This is the final approval checkpoint before the product leaves the manufacturing line.
- **Resource type:** Performed by Operator C (separate from production operators), representing independent quality assurance.
- **Temporal position:** Occurs last, after all manufacturing and intermediate inspection steps.
- **Semantic function:** Represents final human validation of overall product quality.
- **Output determinant:** Results in pass/fail decision that determines product release or rework.
