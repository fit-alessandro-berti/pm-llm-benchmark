The following are the two specified POWL models, one representing the hiring process with potential unfairness and the other without it.

**1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

In this model, we include an XOR branching after the skill assessment. One branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other to a "CommunityAffiliationCheck." This branching creates a potential for bias by giving applicants with local or specific affiliations an implicit advantage.

Here is the python code for the POWL model with potential unfairness:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Transitions
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# XOR for Cultural Fit and Community Affiliation Check
CulturalOrAffiliation = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Loops for Data Completeness
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Main Process Flow
Main = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, DataLoop, SkillAssessment, CulturalOrAffiliation, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
Main.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)
Main.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)
Main.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalOrAffiliation)
Main.order.add_edge(CulturalOrAffiliation, ManagerialReview)
Main.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**

In this model, we ensure no XOR branching exists for community affiliation checks. All applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation, and there is no path where community affiliation gives a subtle advantage.

Here is the python code for the POWL model without unfairness:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Transitions
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loops for Data Completeness
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Main Process Flow
Main = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, DataLoop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
Main.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)
Main.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)
Main.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
Main.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
Main.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Comparison**

1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**: The presence of the XOR branch introduces a path where applicants are assessed differently based on community affiliation, leading to potential bias.
2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness**: Removing the XOR branch ensures that all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process, eliminating this potential source of bias.

These two models reflect the described hiring process with and without the bias-introducing step. The first model includes the XOR operator that can create unfairness, while the second model ensures no such possibility exists by using a uniform evaluation path.
