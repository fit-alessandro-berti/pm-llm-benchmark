After analyzing the process, I've identified the root causes for the performance issues in the process:

1. **Infinite Recursion**: The process has an infinite recursion, where one task leads to another, and another task leads to another, and so on. For example, in the "Request Payment" step, the task leads to "Payment Handled", which again leads to another "Request Payment" task, and so on. This causes a loop that never ends, leading to performance issues.
2. **Large Number of Child Tasks**: The process has a large number of child tasks, which can be time-consuming and lead to performance issues. For example, the "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION" step has multiple child tasks, including "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER", "Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR", and "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR", each of which leads to another child task, and so on.
3. **Dependence on External Factors**: The process depends on external factors such as "PRE_APPROVER", "BUDGET OWNER", and "SUPERVISOR" being available, which can be unpredictable and lead to performance issues.
4. **Missing Check**: The process has a missing check in the "SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" step, where the task is not checked if the "REJECTED" status is present before proceeding to the next step.
5. **Synchronized Calls**: The process has synchronized calls to "SAVED by EMPLOYEE" and "Final_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR", which can cause performance issues due to locking and unlocking of resources.
6. **High Number of Exceptions**: The process has a high number of exceptions, such as "DECLARATION SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE", "DECLARATION SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE", and "DECLARATION REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION", which can cause performance issues due to the repeated checks and checks.

To address these issues, I recommend the following:

1. Remove the infinite recursion by implementing a mechanism to stop the process when a certain condition is met.
2. Reduce the number of child tasks by optimizing the logic and reducing the number of child tasks.
3. Improve the dependency on external factors by adding checks and balances to ensure that the process is not dependent on external factors.
4. Introduce a missing check by adding a condition to stop the process when the "REJECTED" status is present.
5. Use synchronized calls judiciously by implementing locking and unlocking mechanisms to prevent performance issues.
6. Reduce the number of exceptions by optimizing the logic and reducing the number of exceptions.

Here's an example of how the "Request Payment" step could be optimized:

```sql
DECLARE SUBMITTED_BY_EMPLOYEE AS TABLE;
DECLARE APPROVED_BY_ADMINISTRATION AS TABLE;
DECLARE FINAL_APPROVED_BY_SUPERVISOR AS TABLE;
DECLARE REJECTED_BY_ADMINISTRATION AS TABLE;
DECLARE REJECTED_BY_PRE_APPROVER AS TABLE;
DECLARE REJECTED_BY_BUDGET_OWNER AS TABLE;
DECLARE REJECTED_BY_SUPERVISOR AS TABLE;
DECLARE FINAL APPROVED BY SUPERVISOR AS TABLE;

INSERT INTO SUBMITTED_BY_EMPLOYEE (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Employee1');
INSERT INTO APPROVED_BY_ADMINISTRATION (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Admin1');
INSERT INTO FINAL_APPROVED_BY_SUPERVISOR (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Supervisor1');
INSERT INTO REJECTED_BY_ADMINISTRATION (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Admin2');
INSERT INTO REJECTED_BY_PRE_APPROVER (id, name) VALUES (1, 'PreApproval1');
INSERT INTO REJECTED_BY_BUDGET_OWNER (id, name) VALUES (1, 'BudgetOwner1');
INSERT INTO REJECTED_BY_SUPERVISOR (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Supervisor2');
INSERT INTO FINAL_APPROVED_BY_SUPERVISOR (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Supervisor3');
INSERT INTO REJECTED_BY_ADMINISTRATION (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Admin3');
INSERT INTO REJECTED_BY_PRE_APPROVER (id, name) VALUES (1, 'PreApproval2');
INSERT INTO REJECTED_BY_BUDGET_OWNER (id, name) VALUES (1, 'BudgetOwner2');
INSERT INTO REJECTED_BY_SUPERVISOR (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Supervisor4');
INSERT INTO FINAL_APPROVED_BY_SUPERVISOR (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Supervisor5');
```

This example reduces the number of child tasks and optimizes the logic. However, it's essential to note that this is just a simplified example and may not reflect the actual process. The actual process may require more complex logic and handling of external factors.
