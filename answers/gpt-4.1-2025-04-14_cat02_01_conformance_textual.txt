Let's analyze each case in the event log step by step, comparing their activity sequences to the **normative process**, and identify any violations.

---

## Reference: Normative Sequences

**A. Fulfillment Path (sufficient inventory):**  
`Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`

**B. Cancellation Path (insufficient inventory):**  
`Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`

**Key constraints:**
- Authorize payment **only after** Check inventory, and **before** packaging.
- “Package items” **only after** Authorize payment, **before** Ship order.
- “Ship order” **only after** packaging, **never after cancellation**.
- “Close order” **must be the final activity**.
- **If canceled, only “Close order” follows**—no fulfillment steps after “Cancel order”.

## Event Log Analysis

### **Case 1**

| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-05 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-05 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-05 11:00    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-05 12:00    | Package items      |
| 2023-10-05 13:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-05 14:00    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**  
Matches the Fulfillment Path sequence exactly.

**Result:**  
 **No violations.**

### **Case 2**

| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-06 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-06 09:30    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-06 10:00    | Package items      |    
| 2023-10-06 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-06 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-06 11:30    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- "Package items" **occurs before** "Authorize payment".
- According to the process, payment **must be authorized before packaging** (“Package items” should only occur after verification of payment).

**Result:**  
 **Violation: "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment."**  
- This sequence **violates the constraint** that items should only be packaged after payment has been authorized.

### **Case 3**

| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-07 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-07 09:20    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-07 09:40    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-07 10:00    | Cancel order       |
| 2023-10-07 10:30    | Ship order         |   
| 2023-10-07 11:00    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order".
    - The normative text says **if inventory is insufficient, go directly to "Cancel order"**; authorization of payment isn’t supposed to happen (payment should not be authorized for unfulfillable orders).
    - Could conceivably allow a payment authorization attempt for investigation, but “Ship order” after cancellation is a clear violation.
- "Ship order" occurs **after "Cancel order"**, which is explicitly marked as illogical/forbidden in the description.

**Result:**  
 **Violations:**
  1. **"Authorize payment" occurred before "Cancel order" (but cancellation scenario should not include payment authorization).**
  2. **"Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order", which is explicitly prohibited.**

### **Case 4**

| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-08 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-08 09:10    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-08 09:20    | Cancel order       |
| 2023-10-08 09:50    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**  
Matches the Cancellation Path sequence. No fulfillment steps after cancellation.

**Result:**  
 **No violations.**

---

### **Case 5**

| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-09 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-09 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-09 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-09 11:00    | Ship order         |    
| 2023-10-09 11:30    | Close order        |

**Analysis:**
- Missing "Package items" between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".
- The process explicitly says: “Once the payment is authorized, items should be packaged before proceeding to shipping.”
- Shipping cannot occur without prior packaging.

**Result:**  
 **Violation: "Ship order" occurred without preceding "Package items".**

## **Summary Table**

| Case | Violates Normative Process? | Explanation |
|------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 1    |  No                       | Follows correct (fulfillment) sequence. |
| 2    |  Yes                      | "Package items" before "Authorize payment"; violates required order. |
| 3    |  Yes                      | "Authorize payment" in cancel path; "Ship order" after "Cancel order". |
| 4    |  No                       | Follows correct (cancellation) sequence. |
| 5    |  Yes                      | "Ship order" without prior "Package items"; violates required order. |

## **Explanations for Each Violation**

### **Case 2**  
- **What’s wrong:** "Package items" comes *before* "Authorize payment".
- **Normative reference:** Payment must be authorized before packaging is performed.
- **Interpretation:** Prepping goods before ensuring payment is authorized is not allowed.

### **Case 3**  
- **What’s wrong:**  
   1. "Authorize payment" occurs, but process then cancels order (should not authorize payment on unfulfillable/cancelled orders).
   2. "Ship order" occurs *after* "Cancel order" (never permitted).
- **Normative reference:**  
   - Cancellation path should *not* include payment or fulfillment steps.
   - Never ship after cancellation.
- **Interpretation:** Either insufficient inventory was found (making payment and shipment moot and forbidden), or the order was mishandled after being canceled.

### **Case 5**  
- **What’s wrong:** "Ship order" follows directly after "Authorize payment" (no "Package items" in between).
- **Normative reference:** Items must be packaged before shipping.
- **Interpretation:** Shipping cannot happen without packaging step.

# **Final List of Violating Cases:**

**Cases 2, 3, and 5** violate the normative process flow.

- **Case 2:** "Package items" before "Authorize payment."
- **Case 3:** "Authorize payment" and "Ship order" after cancellation.
- **Case 5:** "Ship order" without "Package items."

Cases **1** and **4** are valid and follow the normative process.
