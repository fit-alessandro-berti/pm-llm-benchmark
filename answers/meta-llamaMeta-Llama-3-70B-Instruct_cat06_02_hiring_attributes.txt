Based on the provided event log and attributes, the following attributes are potentially sensitive for fairness:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a citizen or not. Citizenship status can be a protected attribute in many jurisdictions, and discrimination based on citizenship status is illegal in many countries.
2. `case:gender`: This attribute indicates the gender of the applicant. Gender is a protected attribute in many jurisdictions, and discrimination based on gender is illegal in many countries.
3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute indicates whether the applicant speaks German or not. While language proficiency may be a legitimate requirement for certain jobs, it can also be a proxy for national origin or ethnicity, which are protected attributes in many jurisdictions.
4. `case:religious`: This attribute indicates whether the applicant has a religious affiliation or not. Religious beliefs and affiliations are protected attributes in many jurisdictions, and discrimination based on religion is illegal in many countries.

These attributes are commonly considered sensitive because they can be used as proxies for protected characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or gender, which are protected by anti-discrimination laws in many jurisdictions. Fairness metrics and techniques can be applied to ensure that the hiring process is free from bias and discrimination with respect to these attributes.
