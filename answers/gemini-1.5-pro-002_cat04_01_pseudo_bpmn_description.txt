This process describes how a customer request is handled, differing based on whether the request is standard or custom.

**Process Breakdown:**

1. **Start Event:** The process begins when a customer submits a request.

2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request":**  This involves receiving and registering the customer's request details.

3. **Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type":** This exclusive gateway determines the subsequent path based on the type of request (standard or custom). Only one path is taken.

4. **Standard Request Path:**
    * **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation":** Standard checks are performed to ensure the request is valid (e.g., format, completeness).
    * **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks":** This parallel gateway triggers two checks concurrently:
        * **Task C1: "Credit Check":** Verifies the customer's creditworthiness.
        * **Task C2: "Inventory Check":** Confirms product availability in stock.
    * **Join:**  The process waits here until both the credit and inventory checks are completed.
    * **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date":** Based on the inventory and other factors, the estimated delivery date is calculated.


5. **Custom Request Path:**
    * **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis":** Determines if the custom request is technically and practically feasible.
    * **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?":** This gateway determines the next step based on the feasibility study's outcome.
        * **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation":** If feasible, a custom quotation is prepared, detailing the cost and timeline.
        * **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice":** If not feasible, the customer is informed with a rejection notice. This leads directly to the end of the process for this request.

6. **Convergence Point & Approval Check:** After either the standard or custom path is completed (up to Task D or E1), the process converges.
    * **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?":** Checks if management approval is required. This could be based on the request value, custom complexity, or other factors.
        * **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval":** If approval is needed, the request is submitted to a manager for review and decision.
        * **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?":** Based on the manager's decision:
            * **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice":** If approved, the final invoice is generated.
            * **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions":** If rejected, the conditions of the request (e.g., delivery date, specifications) are re-evaluated. This creates a loop back to either:
                * **Task E1:** For custom requests, requiring a revised quotation.
                * **Task D:** For standard requests, requiring a recalculation of the delivery date (perhaps due to inventory changes or other constraints).

7. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer":**  Once the invoice is generated (Task G), a confirmation is sent to the customer regardless of the request type.

8. **End Event:** The process concludes.


**Key Differences based on Request Type:**

* **Standard requests** follow a more streamlined path with automated checks and calculations.
* **Custom requests** require a feasibility analysis and potentially a quotation process, adding complexity and the possibility of rejection.

**Triggers for Approvals and Rework:**

* **Approvals** are triggered based on specific criteria (not defined here but likely related to cost, risk, or customization complexity).
* **Rework** (loop back) is triggered if managerial approval is denied, prompting re-evaluation and adjustments to either the custom quotation or the standard request's delivery date.


This detailed explanation clarifies the steps, decision points, and different paths within the process, highlighting the variations based on request type and the conditions that trigger approvals or rework.  A visual BPMN diagram would further enhance the understanding of this process.
