Sure, here's a possible Log Skeleton model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:

{
    'equivalence': {('approve_purchase', 'confirm_receipt')},
    'always_before': {'approve_purchase': {'confirm_receipt'}},
    'always_after': {'confirm_receipt': {'close_case'}},
    'never_together': {('approve_purchase', 'confirm_receipt'), ('confirm_receipt', 'close_case')},
    'activ_freq': {'approve_purchase': {0, 1}, 'confirm_receipt': {1}, 'close_case': {1}},
    'directly_follows': {'approve_purchase': 'confirm_receipt', 'confirm_receipt': 'close_case'}
}

In this model, the 'approve_purchase' activity is equivalent to the 'confirm_receipt' activity, meaning that their occurrences should match. The 'approve_purchase' activity must always occur before the 'confirm_receipt' activity. After the 'confirm_receipt' activity occurs, the 'close_case' activity must be executed. The 'never_together' constraint ensures that the 'approve_purchase' and 'confirm_receipt' activities cannot coexist in the same case. The 'activ_freq' dictionary specifies the allowed number of occurrences for each activity. The 'directly_follows' constraint indicates that the 'approve_purchase' activity is followed by the 'confirm_receipt' activity, and the 'confirm_receipt' activity is followed by the 'close_case' activity.
