Here are the two POWL models for the described hiring processes at GlobalTeq Solutions:

### **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

This model includes the XOR branching after the skill assessment, where one branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation and the other gives an advantage through a “CommunityAffiliationCheck.”

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Transitions
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_more_info])

# XOR branching for cultural fit
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_affiliation_check])

# Workflow structure
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, data_completeness_loop, skill_assessment, cultural_fit_xor, managerial_review, final_decision])

# Ordering of activities
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_completeness_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, skill_assessment)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_xor, managerial_review)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

### **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**

This model removes the XOR branching and ensures all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation, eliminating the community affiliation bias.

```python
# Transitions (same as above)
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_more_info])

# Workflow structure without XOR branching
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, data_completeness_loop, skill_assessment, cultural_fit, managerial_review, final_decision])

# Ordering of activities
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_completeness_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, skill_assessment)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit)
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, managerial_review)
root_fair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

### Key Differences:
1. **Unfair Model**:
   - Incorporates an XOR branch after the skill assessment.
   - One branch evaluates all applicants via the standard cultural fit process.
   - The other branch privileges certain applicants through a “CommunityAffiliationCheck.”

2. **Fair Model**:
   - No XOR branching; all applicants follow the same process for cultural fit evaluation.
   - Ensures uniform treatment, eliminating the subtle bias from community affiliations.

These models capture the process's essence and clearly highlight the difference between fairness and potential bias.
