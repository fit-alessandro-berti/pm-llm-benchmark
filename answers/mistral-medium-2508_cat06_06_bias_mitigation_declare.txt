Here's the updated `declare_model` with new constraints to mitigate bias, followed by an explanation of each addition:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},  # Ensure manual review exists in traces
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Ensure bias check exists
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # If race is checked, bias check must follow
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # If gender is checked, bias check must follow
    },
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Manual review must coexist with minority rejections
        "Reject_Female": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Manual review must coexist with female rejections
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Decision must respond to bias check
    },
    "precedence": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Decision must be preceded by bias check
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Race check must be followed by bias check
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Prevent direct succession from race check to rejection
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Prevent direct succession from gender check to rejection
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of Added Constraints:

1. **Existence Constraints**:
   - Added `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` to ensure these activities must exist in every valid trace. This guarantees that fairness checks are always performed.

2. **Responded Existence**:
   - If `CheckApplicantRace` or `CheckApplicantGender` occurs, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must follow. This prevents decisions from being made immediately after sensitive attribute checks.

3. **Coexistence**:
   - For `Reject_Minority` and `Reject_Female`, a `ManualReview` must coexist in the trace. This ensures that rejections for sensitive groups are always reviewed manually.

4. **Response/Precedence**:
   - A `FinalDecision` must respond to and be preceded by a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This enforces that decisions are only made after bias checks.

5. **Succession**:
   - `CheckApplicantRace` must be followed by `BiasMitigationCheck`. This prevents direct transitions from sensitive attribute checks to decisions.

6. **Non-Succession**:
   - Prevents direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` or `CheckApplicantGender` to `Reject`. This avoids immediate biased outcomes after sensitive attribute checks.

### How These Constraints Reduce Bias:
- **Manual Review for Sensitive Groups**: Ensures that rejections for minority or female applicants are always manually reviewed, reducing the risk of automated bias.
- **Mandatory Bias Checks**: Forces the process to perform bias mitigation checks before making decisions, especially after sensitive attribute checks.
- **Prevent Direct Transitions**: Blocks immediate transitions from sensitive attribute checks to rejections, ensuring intermediate fairness steps are taken.
- **Trace-Level Fairness**: By requiring coexistence and succession of fairness checks, the model ensures that bias mitigation is embedded in the process flow.

This updated model enforces fairness by design, making it harder for biased decisions to occur without proper oversight.
