### **1. Identifying Cases with Performance Issues**
First, let's calculate the **total duration** (from **Submit Claim** to **Close Claim**) for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time (Submit Claim) | End Time (Close Claim) | Duration (Days) |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00          | 2024-04-01 10:30       | **0.05 days**   |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05          | 2024-04-02 11:00       | **1.46 days**   |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10          | 2024-04-03 09:30       | **2.39 days**   |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20          | 2024-04-01 10:45       | **0.06 days**   |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25          | 2024-04-04 14:30       | **3.56 days**   |

**Observation:**
- **Cases 2002, 2003, and 2005** are significantly slower than **2001 and 2004**.
- **Case 2005 (3.56 days)** is the worst performer, followed by **2003 (2.39 days)** and **2002 (1.46 days)**.

### **2. Analyzing Root Causes Using Attributes**
Now, let's examine how **Resource, Region, and Complexity** correlate with long durations.

#### **A. Complexity Impact**
| Case ID | Complexity | # of "Request Additional Documents" | Duration (Days) |
|---------|------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 2001    | Low        | 0                                   | 0.05            |
| 2002    | Medium     | 1                                   | 1.46            |
| 2003    | High       | 2                                   | 2.39            |
| 2004    | Low        | 0                                   | 0.06            |
| 2005    | High       | 3                                   | 3.56            |

**Key Insight:**
- **High-complexity claims (2003, 2005)** take **far longer** than low-complexity ones.
- **Multiple "Request Additional Documents" events** (especially in **2003 and 2005**) significantly delay approval.
- **Medium-complexity (2002)** also suffers but less severely (only 1 request).

**Hypothesis:**
- **High-complexity claims require more back-and-forth with claimants**, increasing processing time.
- **Multiple document requests** (e.g., 3 in **2005**) create bottlenecks.

---

#### **B. Resource Impact**
| Case ID | Resource Handling "Request Additional Documents" | Duration (Days) |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 2002    | Adjuster_Lisa (1 request)                        | 1.46            |
| 2003    | Adjuster_Mike (2 requests)                       | 2.39            |
| 2005    | Adjuster_Lisa (3 requests)                       | 3.56            |

**Key Insight:**
- **Adjuster_Lisa** handles **both the slowest cases (2002, 2005)**.
- **Adjuster_Mike** also handles a slow case (**2003**), but with fewer requests.
- **Possible Issue:** **Adjuster_Lisa may be overloaded or less efficient** in handling document requests.

**Hypothesis:**
- **Some adjusters are slower in processing requests**, leading to delays.
- **Lack of standardization in document request handling** may cause inconsistencies.

#### **C. Regional Impact**
| Case ID | Region | Duration (Days) |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| 2001    | A      | 0.05            |
| 2002    | B      | 1.46            |
| 2003    | A      | 2.39            |
| 2004    | B      | 0.06            |
| 2005    | B      | 3.56            |

**Key Insight:**
- **Region B (2002, 2005)** has **two of the slowest cases**, while **Region A (2003)** has one slow case.
- **Region B’s slow cases involve Adjuster_Lisa**, suggesting **regional resource inefficiencies**.

**Hypothesis:**
- **Region B may have fewer adjusters or higher claim volumes**, leading to bottlenecks.
- **Adjuster_Lisa’s workload is concentrated in Region B**, increasing delays.

---

### **3. Proposed Explanations & Mitigation Strategies**
#### **Root Causes of Performance Issues:**
1. **High Complexity  More Document Requests  Longer Processing**
   - High-complexity claims require **multiple rounds of document collection**, increasing lead time.
   - **Example:** Case **2005** had **3 document requests** before approval.

2. **Adjuster Efficiency Variations**
   - Some adjusters (e.g., **Adjuster_Lisa**) are **slower in processing requests**, leading to delays.
   - **Example:** Both **2002 and 2005** were handled by **Adjuster_Lisa**, both being slow.

3. **Regional Workload Imbalances**
   - **Region B** has **higher slow-case concentration**, possibly due to **resource shortages**.
   - **Example:** **2002 and 2005 (both in Region B)** were slow, while **2004 (also in B)** was fast.

4. **Lack of Standardization in Document Requests**
   - Some claims require **unnecessary or redundant document requests**, prolonging processing.

#### **Mitigation Strategies:**
| **Root Cause** | **Solution** |
|----------------|-------------|
| **High complexity  More requests** | - **Pre-approval screening** to reduce unnecessary document requests. <br> - **Automated document verification** (e.g., AI-based checks). <br> - **Prioritize high-complexity claims** for dedicated adjusters. |
| **Adjuster inefficiencies** | - **Training & performance reviews** for slow adjusters (e.g., **Adjuster_Lisa**). <br> - **Assign faster adjusters** to high-complexity cases. <br> - **Implement workload balancing** to prevent overloading. |
| **Regional bottlenecks** | - **Reallocate resources** from low-demand (Region A) to high-demand (Region B). <br> - **Expand adjuster team in Region B** if volume is high. <br> - **Cross-training adjusters** to handle peak loads. |
| **Unnecessary document requests** | - **Standardize document request criteria** to avoid redundant requests. <br> - **Implement a "first-time right" policy** to reduce rework. <br> - **Use AI to flag incomplete claims early**, reducing delays. |

---

### **Final Recommendations:**
1. **Prioritize high-complexity claims** with dedicated adjusters to reduce document request cycles.
2. **Monitor adjuster performance** and reassign slower workers (e.g., **Adjuster_Lisa**) to less critical tasks.
3. **Balance regional workloads** by redistributing adjusters from low-demand (Region A) to high-demand (Region B).
4. **Automate document verification** to minimize manual delays.
5. **Implement a "first-time right" policy** to reduce redundant document requests.

By addressing these root causes, the insurance claims process can achieve **consistent, faster processing** while maintaining accuracy.
