The visualization is a UML-style modeling example showing how two “proclet” (process + object) classes interact in a lab workflow, plus a simple class diagram and a message/log example.

**(a) Process interaction (left): “Lab visit”  “Lab test”**
- Two separate process fragments are shown:
  - **Lab visit** (left): *Order entry  Take blood sample  Receive result  (if needed) Do tests again  Receive updated result  Send report*.
  - **Lab test** (right): *Perform test  Make report  Finish lab test*, with an alternate path for retesting: *Perform test again  Provide updated report*.
- The two processes communicate via **two channels** (dashed boxed areas):
  - **Order system**: used to send a test request from the lab visit to the lab test process.
  - **HIS** (Hospital Information System): used to return results/updated results back to the lab visit.
- Small numbered markers on the channels indicate message/interaction points (e.g., requests going out, results coming back).
- Roles (e.g., doctor, lab assistant, chemical analyst) are annotated next to activities, and decision points like “Everything fine” indicate branching.

**(b) Class diagram (top-right)**
- Shows two proclet classes:
  - **Lab visit**
  - **Lab test**
- Relationship: a **Lab visit requires 1..*** Lab test(s), and each **Lab test is associated with 1** Lab visit (multiplicity shown as 1..1 on the Lab visit side and 1..* on the Lab test side).

**(c) Performative/message example (bottom)**
- A table illustrates an example communication record with fields like **Time, Channel, Sender, Receivers, Action, Content, Scope, Direction**.
- Example shown: at **11:00**, via **Order system**, sender **Lab visit – John** to receiver **Lab test – HGB**, action **Create**, content “Can you perform a HGB test for John?”, scope **Private**, direction **OUT**.
