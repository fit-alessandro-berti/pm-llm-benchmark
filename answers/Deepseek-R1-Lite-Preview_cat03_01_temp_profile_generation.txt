### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Identify Activities**: Determine the key activities in the Purchase-to-Pay process.
   - Purchase Request (PR)
   - Purchase Order (PO)
   - Goods Receipt (GR)
   - Invoice Receipt (IR)
   - Invoice Verification (IV)
   - Payment Request (PRQ)
   - Payment Execution (PE)

2. **Determine Activity Pairs**: Consider all possible pairs of activities that can occur eventually in sequence within a trace.

3. **Estimate Average Time (AVG)**: Calculate or estimate the average time between each pair of activities. These times are often based on historical data or organizational standards.

4. **Estimate Standard Deviation (STDEV)**: Determine the variability in the time between activities. This reflects how much the actual times deviate from the average.

5. **Convert Time to Seconds**: Since the example provided uses seconds, convert all time estimates to seconds.

6. **Create the Temporal Profile**: Organize the data into a Python dictionary with the specified format.

### Temporal Profile for Purchase-to-Pay Process

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Purchase Request', 'Purchase Order'): (86400, 3600),    # 1 day avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('Purchase Request', 'Goods Receipt'): (172800, 7200),    # 2 days avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('Purchase Request', 'Invoice Receipt'): (172800, 7200),  # 2 days avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('Purchase Request', 'Invoice Verification'): (172800, 7200),  # 2 days avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('Purchase Request', 'Payment Request'): (259200, 10800), # 3 days avg, 3 hours stdev
    ('Purchase Request', 'Payment Execution'): (345600, 14400), # 4 days avg, 4 hours stdev
    ('Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'): (86400, 3600),       # 1 day avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('Purchase Order', 'Invoice Receipt'): (86400, 3600),     # 1 day avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('Purchase Order', 'Invoice Verification'): (86400, 3600), # 1 day avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('Purchase Order', 'Payment Request'): (172800, 7200),    # 2 days avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('Purchase Order', 'Payment Execution'): (259200, 10800), # 3 days avg, 3 hours stdev
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): (86400, 3600),      # 1 day avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Verification'): (86400, 3600), # 1 day avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Payment Request'): (172800, 7200),     # 2 days avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Payment Execution'): (259200, 10800),  # 3 days avg, 3 hours stdev
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Invoice Verification'): (3600, 3600), # 1 hour avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Request'): (86400, 3600),    # 1 day avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Execution'): (172800, 7200), # 2 days avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('Invoice Verification', 'Payment Request'): (86400, 3600), # 1 day avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('Invoice Verification', 'Payment Execution'): (172800, 7200), # 2 days avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('Payment Request', 'Payment Execution'): (86400, 3600)   # 1 day avg, 1 hour stdev
}
```

**Notes**:

- **Time Units**: All times are in seconds.
  - 1 hour = 3600 seconds
  - 1 day = 86400 seconds

- **Activity Pairs**: The dictionary includes pairs of activities that can eventually follow each other in a trace, not just directly.

- **Standard Deviation**: Reflects variability in the time between activities; in this example, it's set proportionally to the average time.

- **Process Execution**: This profile can be used to detect deviations in the process execution based on the given ZETA value.
