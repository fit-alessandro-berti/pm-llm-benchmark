To model the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions using POWL, we will define two models: one that includes a potential source of unfairness due to community affiliation checks and another that ensures a fair process by removing such checks.

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model, we will have an XOR choice after the skill assessment stage that either leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation or to a community affiliation check that potentially biases the evaluation.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions for each activity
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for ensuring data completeness
dataCompletenessLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define XOR choice for cultural fit or community affiliation check
culturalOrCommunityCheck = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the main process order
processOrder = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, dataCompletenessLoop, SkillAssessment, culturalOrCommunityCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
processOrder.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, dataCompletenessLoop)
processOrder.order.add_edge(dataCompletenessLoop, SkillAssessment)
processOrder.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, culturalOrCommunityCheck)
processOrder.order.add_edge(culturalOrCommunityCheck, ManagerialReview)
processOrder.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# The model with potential unfairness
unfairModel = processOrder
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

In this model, we ensure that all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process, eliminating any special community-based branches.

```python
# Define transitions for each activity (same as before)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for ensuring data completeness (same as before)
dataCompletenessLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the main process order without the XOR branch
processOrder = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, dataCompletenessLoop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
processOrder.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, dataCompletenessLoop)
processOrder.order.add_edge(dataCompletenessLoop, SkillAssessment)
processOrder.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
processOrder.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
processOrder.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# The model without unfairness
fairModel = processOrder
```

In these models, the process with potential unfairness includes an XOR choice that allows for a separate, potentially biased community affiliation check. The process without unfairness ensures all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation, thereby maintaining fairness in the hiring process.
