ANOMALIES IN THE DECLARE MODEL  

1. Mandatory-but-forbidden Evaluation  
   • Constraint “existence C” makes Close (C) obligatory in every trace,  
   • Constraint “noncoexistence E  C” forbids any trace that contains both Evaluation (E) and Close (C).  
   Result: every valid trace must contain C, therefore no trace is allowed to contain E. This directly contradicts the intended flow, where E is a required step before Approval and Close.

2. Redundant / Unrealizable Response Rule  
   • “responded_existence E  A” says that if E occurs, Assign (A) must also occur (order unspecified).  
   • Because E is already impossible (see #1), the response rule can never fire, making it redundant and signalling an inconsistency in specification.

3. Order-of-operations Gap  
   • The response rule does not require A to occur before E; the model would allow E first and A later (or even concurrently), which violates business logic that an adjuster must be assigned before evaluation.

4. Missing Critical Precedence Relationships  
   • No rule enforces E  P (Evaluation before Approval) or P  N  C.  
   • Thus traces such as R  A  C or R  A  P  C are formally legal even though they skip evaluation and/or customer notification.

5. Only Partial Start Constraint  
   • “init R” correctly forces Receive to be first, but nothing forbids new activities (e.g., A) from occurring again after C, potentially creating post-closure work that should be impossible.

HYPOTHESES FOR WHY THE ANOMALIES APPEAR  

1. Requirement Misinterpretation  
   Someone may have read “E must not close the claim” as “E and C cannot coexist,” mistakenly encoding it as a non-coexistence instead of “E must precede C”.

2. Unsynchronized Policy Updates  
   The firm might have introduced a rule making C mandatory while forgetting to remove an older rule that temporarily suspended evaluations (e.g., for small-value claims), leaving contradictory remnants in the model.

3. Incomplete Mining / Noise in Event Logs  
   An automated discovery algorithm could have mined constraints from a log that happened to contain no E+C traces due to sampling error or missing event types, falsely inferring non-coexistence.

4. Performance-Driven Shortcuts  
   Under pressure to accelerate payouts, analysts may have added “existence C” (to ensure closure) but kept “noncoexistence E C” to justify bypassing time-consuming evaluations, hoping to catch anomalies manually instead.

SQL-BASED VERIFICATION STRATEGIES  

-- 1. Claims that were closed without ever being evaluated  
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1
              FROM claim_events e
              WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
                AND e.activity = 'C')
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
                  FROM claim_events e
                  WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
                    AND e.activity = 'E');

-- 2. Traces that violate the model’s “noncoexistence” (both E and C present)  
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) > 0
   AND COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) > 0;

-- 3. Evaluations performed before an adjuster was assigned (order anomaly)  
WITH first_eval AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS eval_time
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'E'
  GROUP BY claim_id)
SELECT f.claim_id, f.eval_time
FROM first_eval f
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events a
    WHERE a.claim_id = f.claim_id
      AND a.activity = 'A'
      AND a.timestamp < f.eval_time);

-- 4. Approvals executed with no prior evaluation (skipping E entirely)  
SELECT DISTINCT p.claim_id
FROM claim_events p
LEFT JOIN claim_events e
  ON e.claim_id = p.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
WHERE p.activity = 'P'
  AND e.event_id IS NULL;

-- 5. Activities logged after the claim was closed (post-closure leakage)  
SELECT later.claim_id, later.activity, later.timestamp AS after_close_time
FROM claim_events c
JOIN claim_events later
  ON later.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE c.activity = 'C'
  AND later.timestamp > c.timestamp;

-- 6. Assign events performed by a resource that is not a registered adjuster  
SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.resource
FROM claim_events ce
LEFT JOIN adjusters a
  ON a.adjuster_id::TEXT = ce.resource
WHERE ce.activity = 'A'
  AND a.adjuster_id IS NULL;

Running these queries will reveal whether the contradictory rules occur in real event data, quantify their frequency, and spotlight particular claims that breach the intended process flow or the DECLARE model itself.
