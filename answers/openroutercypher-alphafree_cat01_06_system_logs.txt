- **Case001:** The focus on "Document1.docx" and subsequent activities (tying and saving) were grouped under "Case001".
- **Case002:** Email activities from switching to Chrome to replying to the email were identified as another unit of work, "Case002".
- **Case003:** The interaction with the "Report_Draft.pdf" (opening, scrolling, highlighting) was defined as "Case003".
- **Case004:** Activities related to the "Budget_2024.xlsx" were grouped as "Case004".
- **Case005:** Editing and closing "Quarterly_Report.docx" were separated out as "Case005" after the user's engagement with the spreadsheet.
- Returning to "Document1.docx" was seen as resuming work on the initial case ("Case001") until finalized.

**Activity Naming:**
- **FOCUS/SWITCH:** Interpreted as "Open Document" or similar based on the new application and document.
- **TYPING:** Translated contextually to "Edit Text", "Edit Emails", or "Edit Spreadsheet".
- **SAVE, CLICK, SCROLL:** Converted to action activities like "Save Document", "Reply Email", or "Read PDF Scroll Down".
