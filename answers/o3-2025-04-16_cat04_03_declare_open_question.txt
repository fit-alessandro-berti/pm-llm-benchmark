Below is one possible “reading” of the model if we imagine it is governing the life-cycle of a single loan file (i.e., one customer’s application).  In practice a DECLARE model is only a set of logical sentences (“if-then” and “always/never”) but, when we translate them into everyday language, we can see the concrete intentions that usually hide behind them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  The activities in plain business language
---------------------------------------------------------------------
• Receive Application (A) – the formal intake of the customer’s request.  
• Preliminary Credit Check (B) – a light-weight but mandatory first risk screen.  
• Gather Additional Documents (C) – collect pay slips, tax returns, IDs, etc.  
• Assemble Loan Offer Package (D) – draft term sheet, interest, collateral list.  
• Quality Assurance Review (E) – second-pair-of-eyes / compliance audit.  
• Authorize Contract Terms (F) – obtain the official signature from an approving officer.  
• Transfer Funds (G) – push the money to the customer’s account.  
• Notify Customer (H) – send the decision / next-steps letter or e-mail.  
• Proceed Without Compliance (Z) – an explicitly forbidden, “red-flag” activity.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  What each constraint adds to the story
---------------------------------------------------------------------
(For brevity, “S” = source activity and “T” = target activity)

A. Presence / absence rules  
   • existence(A) and existence(C) – every case must begin by receiving an application and must eventually obtain the extra documents.  
   • absence(Z) – breaking compliance (“Z”) must never happen.  
   • exactly_one(B) – the preliminary check can never be skipped, repeated, or re-run “until it looks good”; it has to be done once and only once.  

B. Start rule  
   • init(A) – the very first thing on the timeline must be “Receive Application”.  Nothing can precede it (e.g., you cannot start by booking collateral or wiring money).  

C. Causal “if S happens then T must follow” patterns  
   • response(A  B) – once the file is received you are obliged to perform the credit check at some point later.  
   • succession(B  C) – tightens the previous rule: (i) after B, C is mandatory; (ii) C cannot occur unless B happened before.  This protects against requesting documents before even knowing whether the applicant clears the credit hurdle.  
   • precedence(E  F) – Authorising contract terms (F) is illegal unless the QA review (E) has already been completed.  
   • chainresponse(D  G) – whenever the offer is assembled (D), the very next executed task must be the fund transfer (G).  No other step may interleave in between; this is typical where the assembly step already contains a final sanction code that directly triggers core-banking disbursement.  
   • chainsuccession(E  D) – if the QA review happens, then immediately afterwards the offer package must be (re-)assembled.  Together with the previous rule it forms an E  D  G “fast lane”.  

D. Mutual presence rules  
   • responded_existence(D  E) – if we ever create an offer package, a QA review must exist somewhere in the same case (even if not immediately after).  
   • coexistence(C  F) – asking for extra documents implies that somebody will later authorise the terms and vice-versa.  This couples risk documentation with final approval.  

E. “Either/or” rules  
   • altresponse(G  H) – After funds are transferred we must eventually either notify the customer (H) … actually this alt-response reads “G followed by H OR some other branch that is not modelled here”.  A typical interpretation is: the customer can be notified electronically (H) or, in another path in the full model, implicitly via an account statement.  
   • altprecedence(H  G) – the symmetrical rule: if the customer is notified, we must previously have either transferred the funds OR satisfied some alternative prerequisite.  The combination of the two ensures that “G and H” usually happen together but still allows edge cases (e.g., notification from an external CRM).  
   • altsuccession(C - E) – Gathering documents must be followed by either a QA review (E) or an alternative compliance activity not shown here (e.g., external auditor sign-off).  

F. Prohibitions (negative constraints)  
   • noncoexistence(G, A) – you may never see “Receive Application” and “Transfer Funds” inside the same trace; i.e., the loan cannot be disbursed in the exact same logical “case” that logs the intake.  In real life this may reflect a separation between the sales case and the back-office funding case.  
   • nonsuccession(H  B) – once the customer has been notified (H), you must never again perform another preliminary credit check (B).  This stops tampering with approved risk data.  
   • nonchainsuccession(F  H) – immediately after the contract terms are authorised you are forbidden to notify the customer; something else (e.g., fund transfer or internal booking) has to happen first.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  How the rules jointly enforce control, quality and transparency
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Sequencing core risk checks  
    • init + exactly_one + response + succession guarantee an “A  B  C” staircase that is present in every single loan file, executed once, and in the right order.  
    • chainprecedence(F  B) makes sure the risk posture established in B is still valid when the final terms are signed; it disallows “post-approval” credit checks.  

2.  Dualcontrol and compliance  
    • responded_existence and coexistence make every offer package (D) pass through QA (E) and final authorisation (F).  Each actor leaves an audit trace that regulators love.  
    • The “absence(Z)” hard stop reflects zero tolerance for bypassing compliance (e.g., money laundering rules, fair-lending checks, GDPR consent).  Declarative constraints raise an alarm as soon as Z is logged.

3.  Fast yet safe disbursement  
    • chainresponse(D  G) plus chainsuccession(E  D) implement a controlled “fast lane” once QA approves: E  D  G, with no opportunity to sneak in manual edits.  
    • noncoexistence(G, A) physically separates the disbursement ledger from the customer-facing sales log, limiting insider fraud opportunities.

4.  Clean case closure  
    • altresponse(G  H) and nonsuccession(H  B) ensure the case ends neatly: customer is told once money is out and risk data are frozen.  
    • nonchainsuccession(F  H) forces technical booking steps (perhaps collateral registration or mortgage inscription) between approval and customer notification so that “legal perfection” is secured before the client is told.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Likely business goals and regulatory pressures behind such strictness
---------------------------------------------------------------------
• Basel III / CRR capital rules – demand demonstrable, single-version-of-truth credit scores performed before any irrevocable commitment.  
• Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) & KYC – drive the mandatory gathering of supporting documents (C) and forbid “Proceed Without Compliance (Z)”.  
• Consumer-protection / Truth-in-Lending – require that the offer (D) be quality-checked (E) and formally authorised (F) before the customer sees it.  
• SOX / internal-controls – separation-of-duties realised through QA and Authorise tasks and through noncoexistence of intake and disbursement logs.  
• Operational-risk minimisation – exactly_one credit check, non-repetition of key approvals, tight chain constraints, all aimed at eliminating “loop-holes” that could be exploited or produce inconsistent data.  
• Customer experience KPIs – chainresponse D  G delivers funds promptly once the file is green-lighted, while altresponse ensures the customer is always informed.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  In summary
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The DECLARE sheet encodes a robust, compliance-oriented lending pipeline.  By declaring “what must (or must never) be true” instead of rigid flowcharts, the bank gains flexibility: cases that respect all rules are automatically legal, even if they follow different paths (e.g., alternative notifications).  At the same time, the model is unforgiving about critical checkpoints—credit assessment, documentation, QA, approval, and eventual customer communication.  This mixture of freedom and hard-stops is exactly what regulators and risk managers expect from a modern, controlled and transparent loan-origination process.
