1. Which cases are noncompliant?  
  • Case 2  
  • Case 3  
  • Case 5  

Cases 1 and 4 follow one of the two admissible paths and are therefore compliant.

2. Explanation of the violations  

The normative description allows only two canonical paths:

A. Stock sufficient (“fulfilment” path)  
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

B. Stock insufficient (“cancellation” path)  
Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

From the text we extract the key rules that every trace must respect:

R1  Check inventory must precede any Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order or Cancel order.  
R2  Authorize payment, if it occurs, must be followed by Package items and may never be followed by Cancel order.  
R3  Package items may only occur after Authorize payment and before Ship order.  
R4  Ship order may only occur after Package items and must never occur after Cancel order.  
R5  Cancel order, once executed, must be followed only by Close order.  
R6  Close order is the last activity of every case.

Below we show how each deviating case breaks one or more of those rules.


Case 2  
Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close

• Package items is executed before Authorize payment (violates R3: “Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping”).  
• Because the authorization is done after packaging, the normal fulfilment sequence is disrupted.


Case 3  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close

• Cancel order appears after Authorize payment (violates R2: cancellation is not allowed once payment is authorised).  
• After Cancel order the trace continues with Ship order (violates R4 and R5: nothing except Close may follow a cancellation, and shipping is expressly forbidden after a cancel).  
• Ship order after cancellation also implies shipping an order that was already cancelled, conflicting with the basic business logic described.


Case 5  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close

• Package items is missing and Ship order is executed directly after Authorize payment (violates R3: packaging must take place between authorisation and shipping).  

Because these traces breach at least one of the mandatory ordering constraints derived from the textual specification, they are classified as deviations from the normative process.
