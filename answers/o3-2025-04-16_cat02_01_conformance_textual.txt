Detailed reasoning, case by case

Case 1  
Sequence: Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order  
Explanation: This is exactly the “sufficient-inventory” path described in the normative text. No rules are violated.

Case 2    violates process
Sequence: Receive  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
Violations  
1. “Package items” occurs before “Authorize payment”.  
   ­– Text states: “Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping.”  
2. Because of the above, “Authorize payment” is not positioned “before packaging” as required.

Case 3    violates process
Sequence: Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order  
Violations  
1. Shipping after a cancellation.  
   ­– Text states: “‘Ship order’ should … never [occur] after a cancellation.”  
2. Cancellation after payment authorization is illogical in the described model.  
   ­– In the “insufficient inventory” branch the path should be Check  Cancel  Close with no payment, packaging or shipping.  
3. (Consequence) Payment is authorised even though the order is eventually cancelled, which contradicts the intent that payment is only authorised when the order will be fulfilled.

Case 4  
Sequence: Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order  
Explanation: This is the prescribed “insufficient-inventory” path (Receive, Check, Cancel, Close). No violations detected.

Case 5    violates process
Sequence: Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
Violations  
1. Missing “Package items” between authorisation and shipping.  
   ­– Text states: “Package items” must occur after authorisation and before shipping because “items must be prepared before they can be shipped.”  
2. Consequently, “Ship order” occurs without prior packaging, breaching the mandated order of activities.

Summary of violated rules  
• Rule: Package items only after Authorize payment and before Ship order.  
  – Broken in Case 2 (too early) and Case 5 (omitted).  
• Rule: Ship order never after Cancel order.  
  – Broken in Case 3.  
• Rule: Cancellation path should not contain payment authorisation, packaging or shipping.  
  – Broken in Case 3 (payment + shipping present).
