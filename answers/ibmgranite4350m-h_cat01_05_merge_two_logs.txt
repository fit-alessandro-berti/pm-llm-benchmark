### Merged Event Log

### Reasoning for Merging and Handling

- **Matching Events**: The system attempted to align events by comparing `order_id` from both logs. If the order IDs matched, it aligned them; otherwise, one event was left separate as a match.
  
- **Handling Slight Timestamp Differences**:
  - The timestamps in Log A are reported at seconds granularity (e.g., 10:00), while those in Log B are slightly off by several milliseconds (e.g., 09:59.58 vs. 10:01.29).
  - In the merged output, all events were aligned using a small timestamp tolerance of approximately ±0.5 seconds to consider them as identical.
  
- **Attribute Integration**:
  - All event attributes from both logs were included in the merged records for consistency and completeness.

- **Chronological Order**: The final order reflects chronological sequence based on the earliest occurrence timestamps, ensuring that all events are presented in a logical timeline.

This process ensures that similar activities across different systems receive unified data while preserving information unique to each system.
