Below is each case copied from the log, followed by an assessment against the intent of the normative description.

-------------------------------------------------
Case 1  
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order  

Assessment: This is exactly the “happy-path” (sufficient inventory).  
Result: COMPLIANT.

-------------------------------------------------
Case 2  
Receive  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  

Violations  
1. “Package items” precedes “Authorize payment”.  
   • The text says payment “should only occur after ‘Check inventory’ and before packaging”.  
   • Therefore packaging must not start until payment is authorised.  

Everything that follows is built on this wrong order, so the case is non-compliant.  
Result: NON-COMPLIANT.

-------------------------------------------------
Case 3  
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order  

Violations  
1. Cancellation followed by fulfilment.  
   • After “Cancel order”, the only remaining step may be “Close order”.  
   • “Ship order” after cancellation is explicitly ruled out (“never after a cancellation”).  
2. Questionable payment authorisation.  
   • If the inventory is insufficient (hence the cancellation), payment should **not** be authorised at all.  
   • Even if we tolerated the authorisation, the subsequent shipment still breaks the rules.  

Result: NON-COMPLIANT.

-------------------------------------------------
Case 4  
Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order  

Assessment: This is the correct short path for insufficient inventory.  
Result: COMPLIANT.

-------------------------------------------------
Case 5  
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  

Violations  
1. Missing “Package items”.  
   • Shipping must be preceded by packaging; the step is completely absent.  
2. Because packaging is missing, “Ship order” is effectively occurring in the wrong position in the flow.

Result: NON-COMPLIANT.

-------------------------------------------------
Summary

• Compliant cases: 1 and 4  
• Non-compliant cases: 2, 3, and 5  

The non-compliant cases violate one or more of the following normative rules distilled from the textual description:

a. Authorise payment must be after Check inventory and before Package items.  
b. Package items must be after Authorise payment and before Ship order.  
c. Ship order must be after Package items and must never occur after a Cancel order.  
d. Once Cancel order occurs, the only remaining step allowed is Close order.  
e. Close order must be the final activity in every case.

Each flagged case breaches at least one of these constraints, as detailed above.
