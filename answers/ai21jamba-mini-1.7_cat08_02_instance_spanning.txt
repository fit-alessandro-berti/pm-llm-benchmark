### 1. **Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**

#### Identifying Constraints

Using process mining techniques, we can leverage the event log to formally identify and quantify the impact of the instance-spanning constraints:

1. **Shared Packing Stations:**
	- **Analysis Approach:** Use the event log to compute the **utilization rate** of Cold-Packing stations over time. Identify instances where orders wait for resource availability. Heatmaps and resource allocation visualizations can reveal contention patterns.
	- **Metrics:**
		- Resource utilization rate: Percentage of time each Cold-Packing station is occupied.
		- Average waiting time for Cold-Packing: Calculated as the difference between the start of the "Packing" activity and the end of the preceding activity.
		- Delay factor: Ratio of waiting time to total processing time for affected orders.
	- **Within- vs. Between-Instance Factors:** Filter the log to separate timing differences caused by inherent activity duration (within-instance) from external dependencies (between-instance).
2. **Shipping Batches:**
	- **Analysis Approach:** Analyze order batch formation patterns using sequence enrichment and grouping techniques. Identify delays caused by waiting for batch completion.
	- **Metrics:**
		- Batch completion time: Time taken for all orders in a batch to complete shipping label generation.
		- Average delay per order due to batching: Calculated as the difference between order completion time and the start of batch shipping label generation.
	- **Impact:** Orders batched together might face delays despite being ready for the next step, increasing end-to-end times.
3. **Priority Handling:**
	- **Analysis Approach:** Identify express orders using event attributes and measure delays imposed on standard orders due to resource sharing.
	- **Metrics:**
		- Priority interruption rate: Percentage of express orders causing standard orders to pause.
		- Excess turnaround time (eTAT): Difference between actual and expected turnaround time for standard orders due to express order handling.
4. **Hazardous Material limits:**
	- **Analysis Approach:** Track the count of hazardous material orders undergoing activities simultaneously and identify violations using compliance rules.
	- **Metrics:**
		- Compliance rate: Ratio of orders processed within limits to total hazardous material orders.
		- Violation frequency: Count of instances where hazardous material limits were exceeded.

#### Metrics and Differentiation

- **Within-Instance Factors:** Analyze individual task durations and variability using statistical tools like coefficient of variation (CV).
- **Between-Instance Factors:** Use sequence mining to link delays to external constraints, such as shared resources or batching triggers.

### 2. **Analyzing Constraint Interactions**

#### Interaction Examples

1. **Cold-Packing and Priority Handling:**
	- Express orders requiring cold-packing might preempt standard orders waiting for cold-packing, further delaying standard orders and increasing overall throughput variance.
2. **Batching and Hazardous Material Limits:**
	- If multiple hazardous material orders are batched together, this could overload the regulatory limit, causing delays in processing the entire batch.
3. **Shared Resources and Batching:**
	- A cold-packing station occupied by a standard order delays batch completion, leading to cascading delays for other orders in the batch.

#### Implications

Constraint interactions highlight the need for a **holistic optimization approach** that accounts for the interplay of these factors. For example, decoupling cold-packing and batching might mitigate delays while maintaining compliance with hazardous material limits.

### 3. **Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**

#### Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Shared Stations

- **Primary Constraint:** Cold-Packing station contention.
- **Changes Proposed:**
	- Implement a dynamic assignment mechanism using predictive analytics (based on order data) to reserve Cold-Packing stations preemptively.
	- Use simulation to model demand patterns and optimize allocation.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced waiting time for both cold-packing and other packing activities.

#### Strategy 2: Revised Batching Logic

- **Primary Constraints:** Batching and Priority Handling.
- **Changes Proposed:**
	- Adjust batch formation logic to prioritize express orders while maintaining batch size limits to minimize delays for standard orders.
	- Introduce intermediate batch triggers to handle urgent express orders without delaying others excessively.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Faster order completion for express items while minimizing additional delay to standard orders.

#### Strategy 3: Scheduling Rules with Priority and Regulatory Limits

- **Primary Constraints:** Hazardous Material Limits and Priority Handling.
- **Changes Proposed:**
	- Develop scheduling rules that consider regulatory limits and express order priorities in sequence. Use queue prioritization based on urgency scores (e.g., express > hazardous > standard).
- **Expected Outcomes:** Improved compliance and reduced priority-related bottlenecks.

#### Strategy 4: Process Decoupling

- **Primary Constraint:** Interdependencies across activities.
- **Changes Proposed:**
	- Move hazardous material checks earlier in the process to decouple them from packing and quality checks.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Simplified workflow and reduced delays for other order types.

### 4. **Simulation and Validation**

#### Simulation Approach

- Use **event-driven simulation** to replicate fulfillment center operations, embedding identified constraints.
- Modify simulation parameters to test proposed strategies (e.g., varying Cold-Packing allocation, batch triggers).

#### Specific Focus Areas

- Resource contention at Cold-Packing stations.
- Impact of batch triggers on completion times.
- Regulatory limit violations under different scenarios.
- Effects of priority handling on standard order delays.

#### Metrics for Validation

- Throughput rate.
- End-to-end delay metrics.
- Compliance rates.
- Resource utilization efficiency.

### 5. **Monitoring Post-Implementation**

#### Key Metrics

- **Resource Utilization:** Station occupancy rates and waiting times.
- **Order Flow:** Batch completion times and delays due to batching.
- **Priority Handling:** Standard order delays caused by express orders.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Hazardous material limit adherence.

#### Dashboards

- **Real-Time Monitoring:**
	- Resource heatmaps and order queues.
	- Alert systems for imminent constraint violations.
- **Trend Analysis:**
	- Historical trend comparisons to track improvements in KPIs (e.g., reduced delays, higher throughput).

#### Continuous Improvement

- Periodic log analysis to validate sustained impact and refine strategies as operational patterns evolve.
