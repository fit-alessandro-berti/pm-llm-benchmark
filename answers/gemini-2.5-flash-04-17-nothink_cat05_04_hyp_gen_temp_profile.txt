Here are the identified anomalies in the temporal profile model, potential hypotheses for their existence, and suggested SQL queries for verification.

**Identified Anomalies:**

*   **Receive to Approve (R to P):** The average time is approximately 25 hours with a very low standard deviation (1 hour). This narrow range around a relatively short timeframe for a potentially complex activity like approval is unusual.
*   **Approve to Notify (P to N):** The average time is a significant 7 days with a large standard deviation (2 days). This indicates a substantial delay in the notification step after approval, and the delay is highly variable.
*   **Assign to Close (A to C):** A relatively short average time of 2 hours with a 1-hour standard deviation between assignment and closure. This is significantly shorter than the expected full process flow.
*   **Evaluate to Notify (E to N):** A very short average time of only 5 minutes with a small standard deviation of 1 minute. This suggests an almost immediate transition between evaluation and notification.

**Hypotheses for Anomalies:**

*   **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
    *   **Automated Approval for Certain Claims:** Some claims might be automatically approved shortly after receipt if they meet specific criteria, leading to a cluster of rapid approvals and thus a low standard deviation.
    *   **Batch Processing:** Approvals might be handled in batches on a daily basis, creating a narrow window of processing times.
    *   **Data Entry Error:** The timestamp for approval might be incorrectly recorded as occurring very close to the receipt timestamp for a significant subset of claims.
*   **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
    *   **Manual Notification Process Bottleneck:** The notification process might be manual and handled by a limited resource, leading to a backlog after claims are approved.
    *   **External Dependency:** Notification might be dependent on an external system or process that is not always readily available or has inconsistent performance.
    *   **Waiting Period:** There might be a deliberate waiting period after approval before notification is sent, possibly related to compliance or internal procedures. The variability could be due to weekend/holiday effects or resource availability.
*   **A to C (Assign to Close):**
    *   **Premature Closure/Cancellation:** Some claims might be closed or cancelled shortly after being assigned without undergoing the full evaluation or approval process. This could be due to reasons like duplicate claims, customer withdrawal, or immediate rejection.
    *   **Fast-Tracked Claims:** A specific category of simple claims might be fast-tracked and closed very quickly after assignment.
    *   **Data Entry Error:** The timestamp for the 'C' event might be incorrectly entered as occurring very soon after the 'A' event.
*   **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
    *   **Automated Notification after Evaluation:** The system might automatically trigger the notification as soon as the evaluation is marked as complete.
    *   **Single System Interaction:** Both the evaluation and notification steps might be recorded almost simultaneously within the same system interaction or transaction.
    *   **Skipping Intermediate Steps:** The process might be skipping intermediate steps that would normally occur between evaluation and notification, leading to the rapid transition.

**SQL Queries for Verification:**

Here are some SQL queries to investigate the proposed hypotheses:

**1. Investigate R to P Anomaly (Suspiciously Low STDEV):**

*   **Query:** Find claims where the time between the first 'R' event and the first 'P' event is within a very narrow window around the average:

    ```sql
    WITH ClaimTimestamps AS (
        SELECT
            claim_id,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS receive_timestamp,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_timestamp
        FROM claim_events
        GROUP BY claim_id
        HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
           AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT
        ct.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.approve_timestamp - ct.receive_timestamp)) AS duration_seconds,
        c.claim_type,
        c.claim_amount
    FROM ClaimTimestamps ct
    JOIN claims c ON ct.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.approve_timestamp - ct.receive_timestamp)) BETWEEN 86400 - 300 AND 86400 + 300 -- Within 5 minutes of 1 day (example narrow window)
    ORDER BY duration_seconds;
    ```
    *   *Purpose:* Identify claims fitting the narrow temporal range to see if they share characteristics (claim type, amount, etc.).

*   **Query:** Check if the 'P' event often occurs at specific times of day or on certain days, suggesting batch processing:

    ```sql
    SELECT
        TO_CHAR(timestamp, 'HH24:MI') AS approval_time_of_day,
        COUNT(*) AS number_of_approvals
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 2 DESC;
    ```
    *   *Purpose:* Look for peaks in approval activity at consistent times, indicating batch processing.

**2. Investigate P to N Anomaly (Long Average, High STDEV):**

*   **Query:** Find claims with very long or very short durations between 'P' and 'N':

    ```sql
    WITH ClaimTimestamps AS (
        SELECT
            claim_id,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_timestamp,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_timestamp
        FROM claim_events
        GROUP BY claim_id
        HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
           AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT
        ct.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.notify_timestamp - ct.approve_timestamp)) AS duration_seconds,
        ce_p.resource AS approver_resource,
        ce_n.resource AS notifier_resource,
        c.claim_type,
        c.region -- Assuming region can be linked via claims table
    FROM ClaimTimestamps ct
    JOIN claim_events ce_p ON ct.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id AND ct.approve_timestamp = ce_p.timestamp AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
    JOIN claim_events ce_n ON ct.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id AND ct.notify_timestamp = ce_n.timestamp AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
    JOIN claims c ON ct.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.notify_timestamp - ct.approve_timestamp)) > 604800 * 1.5 -- More than 1.5 times the average (example)
       OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.notify_timestamp - ct.approve_timestamp)) < 604800 * 0.1 -- Less than 0.1 times the average (example)
    ORDER BY duration_seconds;
    ```
    *   *Purpose:* Identify claims with extreme P-N durations and check associated resources or claim characteristics.

*   **Query:** Analyze P-N duration by the resource performing the 'N' activity:

    ```sql
    WITH ClaimTimestamps AS (
        SELECT
            claim_id,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_timestamp,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_timestamp
        FROM claim_events
        GROUP BY claim_id
        HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
           AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT
        ce_n.resource AS notifier_resource,
        AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.notify_timestamp - ct.approve_timestamp))) AS avg_duration_seconds,
        STDDEV_POP(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.notify_timestamp - ct.approve_timestamp))) AS stdev_duration_seconds,
        COUNT(*) AS number_of_notifications
    FROM ClaimTimestamps ct
    JOIN claim_events ce_n ON ct.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id AND ct.notify_timestamp = ce_n.timestamp AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 2 DESC;
    ```
    *   *Purpose:* See if certain resources are associated with longer or more variable notification times.

**3. Investigate A to C Anomaly (Short Average, Skipping Steps):**

*   **Query:** Find claims where 'C' occurs shortly after 'A' and there are no 'E' or 'P' events in between:

    ```sql
    WITH ClaimTimestamps AS (
        SELECT
            claim_id,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS assign_timestamp,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS close_timestamp
        FROM claim_events
        GROUP BY claim_id
        HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
           AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
           AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) > MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END)
    ),
    ClaimsWithIntermediateSteps AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
        FROM claim_events
        WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P')
    )
    SELECT
        ct.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.close_timestamp - ct.assign_timestamp)) AS duration_seconds,
        ce_a.resource AS assigning_resource,
        ce_c.additional_info AS close_reason -- If available
    FROM ClaimTimestamps ct
    LEFT JOIN ClaimsWithIntermediateSteps cis ON ct.claim_id = cis.claim_id
    JOIN claim_events ce_a ON ct.claim_id = ce_a.claim_id AND ct.assign_timestamp = ce_a.timestamp AND ce_a.activity = 'A'
    JOIN claim_events ce_c ON ct.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id AND ct.close_timestamp = ce_c.timestamp AND ce_c.activity = 'C'
    WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.close_timestamp - ct.assign_timestamp)) < 7200 * 2 -- Less than twice the average (example)
      AND cis.claim_id IS NULL; -- No 'E' or 'P' events found
    ```
    *   *Purpose:* Identify claims that appear to be closed quickly after assignment without standard intermediate steps and check if they have common characteristics or closing reasons.

**4. Investigate E to N Anomaly (Very Short Average):**

*   **Query:** Find claims where the time between 'E' and 'N' is extremely short and examine the resources involved:

    ```sql
    WITH ClaimTimestamps AS (
        SELECT
            claim_id,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS evaluate_timestamp,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_timestamp
        FROM claim_events
        GROUP BY claim_id
        HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
           AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
           AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) > MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END)
    )
    SELECT
        ct.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.notify_timestamp - ct.evaluate_timestamp)) AS duration_seconds,
        ce_e.resource AS evaluator_resource,
        ce_n.resource AS notifier_resource
    FROM ClaimTimestamps ct
    JOIN claim_events ce_e ON ct.claim_id = ce_e.claim_id AND ct.evaluate_timestamp = ce_e.timestamp AND ce_e.activity = 'E'
    JOIN claim_events ce_n ON ct.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id AND ct.notify_timestamp = ce_n.timestamp AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
    WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ct.notify_timestamp - ct.evaluate_timestamp)) < 60 * 1 -- Less than 1 minute (example)
    ORDER BY duration_seconds;
    ```
    *   *Purpose:* Identify instances of very rapid E-N transitions and see if specific resources or claim types are involved.

*   **Query:** Check for claims where 'E' and 'N' events have the exact same timestamp or occur within milliseconds of each other:

    ```sql
    WITH ClaimTimestamps AS (
        SELECT
            claim_id,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS evaluate_timestamp,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_timestamp
        FROM claim_events
        GROUP BY claim_id
        HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
           AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_timestamp - evaluate_timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM ClaimTimestamps
    WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_timestamp - evaluate_timestamp)) <= 0.001; -- Within 1 millisecond (adjust based on timestamp precision)
    ```
    *   *Purpose:* Directly investigate if these steps are being recorded almost simultaneously, suggesting automation or linked system actions.
