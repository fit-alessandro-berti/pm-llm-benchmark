Okay, I need to create a Python dictionary for the temporal profile of a supply chain process. The user wants the average and standard deviation for each pair of activities that follow each other in any process execution. The activities are SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. 

First, I should list all possible activity pairs where the first activity comes before the second in a trace. Not just direct successors but any that follow eventually. For example, even if SS is followed by OP, but also pairs like SS to RC, SS to QI, etc., but not the reverse.

The temporal profile entries should be based on realistic estimates. Let me think of the typical steps in this process:

1. SS (Supplier Selection) comes first. Then OP (Order Placement) probably follows right after, maybe with a short delay. So the average between SS and OP might be a few days? Maybe average 3 days (259200 seconds), SD could be a day or so (86400 seconds). But since the user wants the numbers in seconds, I need to convert days into seconds. Wait, the example given in the prompt uses seconds. So 1 day is 86400, 1 hour is 3600. 

2. After OP comes receiving components (RC). The time between OP and RC depends on supplier's lead time. Let's say average is 7 days (604800 seconds), with SD maybe 2 days (172800 seconds).

3. Then comes Quality Inspection (QI). The delay between RC and QI could be a day or two. So average 1.5 days (129600 seconds), SD 0.5 days (43200).

4. Then Component Assembly (CA) after QI. Maybe a day's work. Average 1 day (86400), SD 12 hours (43200).

5. Product Testing (PT) after CA. Testing might take a few days. Maybe 2 days (172800), SD 0.5 days (43200).

6. Packaging (PK) after PT. Maybe a day. So 86400 avg, SD 24h (same as avg).

7. Then Warehouse Storage (WS). The time between PK and WS could be immediate, but maybe there's some time. Maybe a few hours? Like 12 hours (43200) avg, SD 4 hours (14400).

8. Distribution (DT) after WS. So the time between PK and DT might depend on shipping. Let's say average 5 days (432000 seconds), SD 2 days (172800). 

9. After DT, there's After-Sales Support (AS), but that might come later, perhaps months later? Maybe the time between DT and AS is longer. Let's say average 30 days (2592000), SD 10 days (864000). But maybe AS is not directly after DT? Hmm, the process might have AS as a follow-up after sale, so the pair DT to AS could have a long time. Alternatively, maybe AS is triggered by a customer request, so the delay could be variable. 

But the problem says to consider all pairs that eventually follow each other. So for example, SS to RC: the time from SS to RC would be OP and RC steps, so the average would be OP to RC plus the delay between SS and OP? Wait, no, the temporal profile is the time between the two in the trace, regardless of intermediate steps. Wait, the temporal distance between SS and RC is the actual time between their timestamps. So for the pair (SS, RC), it's the time from SS's end to RC's start, or the total time between their occurrence in the trace. 

So I need to think of the average time between any two activities where the first occurs before the second in a trace. For example, the pair (SS, DT) would have a time that's the sum of all the steps from SS to DT, but with some variance. But since the average and SD are given as the temporal distances between those two in the logs, I need to estimate for each pair.

But how many pairs do I need to include? The user says "representative subset" and "complexity by considering pairs separated by multiple steps." So I need to include not just adjacent pairs but also some non-adjacent ones.

Let me start by listing possible key pairs. Let's consider some steps:

The process order probably is SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS. But maybe not all directly. For example, after WS, the DT might happen immediately, but maybe there's a delay. Also, AS happens after DT, but maybe not immediately. 

So the direct pairs would be:

SS-OP, OP-RC, RC-QI, QI-CA, CA-PT, PT-PK, PK-WS, WS-DT, DT-AS.

But also pairs like SS-RC (SS to RC), SS-QI, etc. Up to all possible ordered pairs where the first is before the second.

But to make it complex, I should include some of these non-adjacent pairs. Let me pick a few key ones.

First, the direct pairs:

1. (SS, OP): Let's say average is 2 days (172800 seconds?), but maybe the user's example uses seconds. Wait, the example in the problem uses (86400, 3600) for A to B. So all times are in seconds. So for SS to OP, maybe the average is 3 days (259200 seconds), SD 1 day (86400). Maybe the selection takes a few days, so the delay between choosing a supplier and placing the order is a few days.

2. (OP, RC): Order placement to receiving. The time here is the supplier's shipping time. Say average 7 days (604800 sec), SD 2 days (172800).

3. (QI comes after RC. So (RC, QI): Maybe 1 day (86400), SD 12 hours (43200).

4. (CA after QI: So (QI, CA) could be a day (86400), SD 6 hours (21600).

5. (PT after CA: (CA, PT): 1 day (86400), SD maybe 12 hours.

6. (PK after PT: (PT, PK) maybe a day, SD 0.5 days (43200).

7. (WS after PK: (PK, WS) maybe a few hours? Like 12 hours (43200), SD 4 hours (14400). Or maybe WS is immediate after PK, so average 6 hours (21600), SD 2 hours (7200).

8. (WS to DT: (WS, DT): The time until distribution. Suppose it takes about 5 days (432000 seconds) on average, SD 2 days (172800). Or maybe if they wait a while before shipping, but sometimes it's done quickly. Hmm, maybe 3 days (259200), SD 1 day.

9. (DT to AS: After distribution, AS might be after a while, but maybe support is ongoing. But the temporal distance here could be variable. Maybe 30 days (2592000), SD 10 days (864000).

Now, some non-adjacent pairs:

(Suppose the trace is SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS)

So the pair (SS, RC) would be the time from SS to RC. That's SS to OP (2 days) plus OP to RC (7 days), total 9 days. So average 777600 seconds (9*86400). The SD would be the sum of the SDs of the individual steps, but since variances add, but maybe the SD is sqrt( (SD1^2 + SD2^2) ). But for simplicity, maybe the average is 9 days, SD maybe 3 days (259200). 

Similarly, (SS, QI) would be SS to OP (2) + OP to RC (7) + RC to QI (1 day), total 10 days. So 864000 seconds, SD around 3 days (259200).

Another pair like (SS, DT) would be the total time from SS to DT. Let's see:

SS to OP: 2 days, OP to RC:7, RC to QI:1, QI to CA:1, CA to PT:1, PT to PK:1, PK to WS: 0.5 days (assuming PK takes a day?), then WS to DT is 3 days. So adding all: 2+7+1+1+1+1+0.5+3 = 15.5 days. So average 1339200 seconds. SD would accumulate, but hard to estimate. Maybe SD as 5 days (432000).

Another pair: (RC, DT). The time from receiving components until distribution. The time would be all steps from RC to DT. That's RC to QI (1), QI to CA (1), etc., leading up to WS to DT (3). So total steps from RC to DT would be (1+1+1+1+0.5+3) = 7.5 days. So 648000 sec, SD 2-3 days.

Alternatively, perhaps the SD for longer steps would be higher. 

Also, maybe pairs like (QI, DT) would have a long time.

Also, some pairs like (SS, AS) would be the entire process from start to AS, which is the full cycle. That's 15.5 + time from DT to AS (say DT to AS is a year? No, AS is after sale, perhaps the temporal distance could be months. Wait, but the temporal profile is for all pairs in the traces. Since AS is the last step, the temporal distance between SS and AS would be the entire process duration plus any delay after DT. But maybe the AS can be triggered anytime after DT, so perhaps the time between DT and AS could be days or weeks. Maybe average 14 days (1209600 sec), SD 7 days (604800).

Alternatively, maybe the AS activity happens multiple times, but in the traces, the AS might follow DT. So the pair (DT, AS) could have an average of 1 month (2592000 seconds? 30 days), SD 10 days.

Hmm. Since the user wants a subset, maybe include some key pairs.

Let me think of some key pairs to include:

Direct pairs:

- SS-OP, OP-RC, RC-QI, QI-CA, CA-PT, PT-PK, PK-WS, WS-DT, DT-AS.

Indirect pairs like:

- SS-RC, SS-QI, SS-Ca, etc. Let's pick some of these.

Maybe also:

- SS to CA: the time from SS to CA would be the sum of the steps between them. Suppose average 10 days (864000 sec?), SD 3 days (259200).

- SS to DT: maybe 2 weeks (1209600 seconds), SD 3 days (259200).

- RC to DT: that would be the time from receiving components to distribution. Suppose that's 10 days (864000), SD 3 days.

- QI to DT: similar.

Also, maybe some later pairs like (WS, AS): but AS comes after DT, which is after WS, so the time from WS to AS is WS to DT (3 days) plus DT to AS (14 days?), so 17 days? But the pair (WS, AS) would be that.

Alternatively, the temporal distance between WS and DT is 3 days, and between DT and AS is 30 days. So WS to AS would be 3+30=33 days, but that's just an example.

Alternatively, maybe some non-sequential pairs like SS to DT, SS to AS, OP to PK, etc.

Let me try to list a few pairs with estimated averages and SDs.

Possible entries:

Start with direct pairs:

('SS', 'OP'): (2 days = 172800, SD 24h (86400? Wait, 2 days average, SD perhaps 1 day? Wait, let's think in days converted to seconds:

Let me pick numbers for each pair:

Direct pairs:

('SS', 'OP'): avg 2 days (172800 sec), SD 1 day (86400).

('OP', 'RC'): 7 days (604800), SD 2 days (172800).

('RC', 'QI'): 1 day (86400), SD 0.5 days (43200).

('QI', 'CA'): 1 day (86400), SD 0.5 days (43200).

('CA', 'PT'): 1 day (86400), SD 0.5 days (43200).

('PT', 'PK'): 1 day (86400), SD 0.5 days (43200).

('PK', 'WS'): 0.5 days (43200), SD 12 hours (43200? Wait 0.5 days is 43200 sec. SD maybe 0.25 days? 21600.

('WS', 'DT'): 3 days (259200), SD 1 day (86400).

('DT', 'AS'): Let's say support requests come in after a month on average, so 30 days (2592000 sec), SD 10 days (864000).

Now non-direct pairs:

('SS', 'RC'): SS to RC is the time from SS to OP (2 days) plus OP to RC (7 days) = 9 days (777600 sec?), so average 9 days (9*86400=777600), SD sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) days? Not sure, but SD could be 3 days (259200).

('SS', 'DT'): The total time from SS to DT is the sum of all steps from SS through to DT. Let's calculate:

SS to DT includes the steps up to DT. Let's see:

SS to OP: 2 days.

OP to RC: 7.

RC to QI: 1.

QI to CA: 1.

CA to PT: 1.

PT to PK:1.

PK to WS: 0.5.

WS to DT:3.

Total: 2+7=9, +1+1+1+1+0.5+3 = total 15.5 days. So 15.5 *86400= 1,343,040 sec. Let's round to 15 days (1,296,000). SD could be 5 days (432,000).

Another pair: ('RC', 'DT') would be from when RC happens until DT. That's the time from receiving components until shipping. So that's the time from RC to DT. 

The steps between RC and DT are QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, then to DT. So the time from RC to DT would be (1+1+1+1+0.5+3)= 7.5 days. So 648,000 sec (7.5*86400=648,000). SD maybe 2 days (172,800).

Another pair: (SS, AS). The total process from SS to AS would be 15.5 + DT to AS time. If DT to AS is 30 days, then total is about 45 days? So average 3,888,000 sec (45 days), SD 15 days (1,296,000).

Alternatively, maybe the AS can happen anytime after DT, so the average between SS and AS is the SS to DT time plus DT to AS time. But maybe the temporal distance between SS and AS is just the full process plus AS's delay. 

Alternatively, perhaps the AS could occur multiple times, but in the trace, the first occurrence of AS would be after DT, so the average between SS and AS is SS to DT plus the time from DT to first AS. Suppose that DT to AS is 14 days on average, so total 15.5+14 = 29.5 days (25552800? Wait no, 29.5 *86400 = 2555280 seconds? Wait 29.5 *86400 = 29.5 *86400 = let's see 29*86400=2,505,600 plus 0.5 *86400=43200  total 2,548,800 sec. So average 2,550,000, SD maybe 7 days (604,800 sec? 7*86400=604800).

Now, some other pairs:

('SS', 'DT') as above.

('OP', 'DT') would be the time from Order Placement to Distribution, which is the sum of OP to DT steps. So OP to DT is 7+1+1+1+1+0.5+3 = 14.5 days. So 12,441,600 seconds (14.5*86400). Hmm, 14.5 * 86400 = 12,444,000? Not sure exact, but approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I'll need to pick a few pairs and estimate their times.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects some of the longer pairs like (SS, DT), (SS, AS), (RC, DT), (QI, DT), etc.

Including some of these in the dictionary.

Also, some other pairs like (SS, PK): from SS to PK is the time from SS to PK. 

Alternatively, maybe I should pick a subset that includes some direct and some indirect pairs to meet the requirement of a representative subset with some separated steps.

Let me compile the dictionary entries, making sure that the keys are tuples of activity pairs, and the values are (avg, stdev) in seconds.

Let me list them step by step.

First, the direct pairs:

('SS', 'OP'): (2 days = 172800, SD 86400 (1 day)).

('OP', 'RC'): (7 days (604800), SD 2 days (172,800).

('RC', 'QI'): 1 day (86400), SD 0.5 days (43200).

('QI', 'CA'): same as above.

('CA', 'PT'): same as previous steps (1 day, SD 0.5 days).

('PT', 'PK'): 1 day, SD 0.5 days.

('PK', 'WS'): 0.5 days (43200), SD 0.25 (21600).

('WS', 'DT'): 3 days (259200), SD 1 day (86400).

('DT', 'AS'): 14 days (1,209,600 seconds?), or maybe 30 days? Wait, if AS is after the product is distributed, maybe the first AS could be a day later, but perhaps the temporal distance between DT and AS is variable. Let's say average 7 days (604,800 seconds), SD 3 days (259,200). So (604800, 259200).

Now non-direct pairs:

('SS', 'RC')  2+7=9 days  777,600 (9 days?), so (777600, 259200 SD).

('SS', 'QI') would be SS to OP (2) + OP to RC (7) + RC to QI (1)  total 10 days (864,000 seconds), SD maybe 3 days (259,200).

('SS', 'DT')  the total time up to DT is 2+7 (OP to RC) +1+1+1+1+0.5 +3  let's see:

Total steps from SS to DT:

SS to OP:2

OP to RC:7  total 9.

RC to QI:1  10.

QI to CA:1 11.

CA to PT:1 12.

PT to PK:1 13.

PK to WS:0.5 13.5.

WS to DT:3  total 16.5 days  16.5 * 86400 = 1,425,600 sec. SD would be the sum of individual SDs? Not sure, but maybe SD is 5 days (432,000).

So ('SS', 'DT'): (1,425,600, 432,000).

('RC' to 'DT': that's the same as from RC to DT. The time after RC is 7 days (since RC to DT is the remaining steps: RC to QI etc. up to DT. Which was 7 days from RC to DT (RC to DT is (1+1+1+1+0.5+3)= 7.5 days  648,000 sec, SD 2 days (172,800).

Another pair: (SS, PK). The time from SS to PK is the steps up to PK. Let's see:

SS to PK: SS to OP (2) + OP to RC (7) + RC steps to PK. So total: 2+7=9 (up to RC), then RC to QI (1), QI to CA 1, CA to PT 1, PT to PK 1  total from RC to PK is 4 days. So total from SS to PK is 9+4=13 days  1,123,200 sec. SD maybe 3 days (259,200).

Also, (SS, AS) would be the entire process plus the AS delay. Let's assume from SS to AS is 16.5 + (DT to AS time). Suppose DT to AS is 14 days (like DT occurs, then after some days AS happens. Let's say average 20 days (1,728,000 sec), SD 5 days (432,000).

Alternatively, maybe the temporal distance from SS to AS is the sum of all steps up to DT plus the DT to AS. So 16.5 days (for SS to DT) plus, say DT to AS average of 14 days (total 30.5 days). So 30.5 *86400 = 26,352,00 seconds (approx 26,35200?) Wait 30.5 * 86400 = 26,35200. But maybe the average is 30 days (2,592,000 sec?), SD 10 days (864,000).

Including some more pairs:

('OP', 'QI'): the time from OP to QI is OP to RC (7 days) plus RC to QI (1), so 8 days (691,200 sec?), SD sqrt(2^2 + 0.5^2 days? Not sure. Maybe SD is 2.5 days (216,000 sec).

Alternatively, the SD could be higher. Maybe for simplicity, the SD is average's 0.3? Not sure, but the user just wants estimated values.

Alternatively, maybe I can choose some pairs with varying averages and SDs.

Also, maybe pairs like (QI, DT): from Quality Inspection to distribution. The time from QI to DT would be the steps from QI to CA, etc. So QI to DT is (QI to CA (1) + CA to PT (1) + ... up to DT. Let's compute:

QI  CA (1), CAPT (1), PTPK (1), PKWS (0.5), WSDT (3). So total is 1+1+1+0.5+3 = 6.5 days. So average 561,600 seconds (6.5*86400).

SD maybe 2 days (172,800).

Another pair: (SS, WS): the time from SS to WS is up to WS. Let's see:

SS to WS: 2+7 (OP to RC) +1+1+1+1+0.5  total days? Let's see:

SS to WS:

SS to OP:2, OP to RC:7 9, then RC to QI (1) 10, QI to CA (1) 11, CA to PT (1 12), PT to PK (1 13), PK to WS (0.5 13.5 days. So 13.5 days (1,166,400 sec), SD 3 days (259,200).

Alternatively, maybe the average is 13.5 days, SD 3 days.

Alternatively, perhaps I can structure the dictionary with several such entries. 

Also, some other pairs like (PK, AS): from packaging to AS. The time would be PK to WS (0.5 days), then WS to DT (3), DT to AS (14). So PK to AS would be 0.5+3 + say DT to AS is 14. So total 0.5+3+14=17.5 days (1,512,000 seconds?), SD 5 days (432,000).

Alternatively, maybe I need to pick a subset without overcomplicating. Let's pick around 10-15 pairs.

Alternatively, the user might expect including some non-sequential pairs like (SS, QI), (SS, DT), (RC, DT), (SS, AS). 

Let me try to write out the dictionary with some of these:

temporal_profile = {

('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 86400),  # 2 days avg, 1 day SD

('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 172800),  # 7 days, SD 2 days.

('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200),

('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 43200),

('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200),

('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 43200),

('PK', 'WS'): (43200, 21600),  # 0.5 days, SD 0.25 days (21600 sec).

('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400), # 3 days, SD 1 day.

('DT', 'AS'): (1209600, 518400), # 14 days average, SD 6 days (6*86400=518,400).

Then some indirect pairs:

('SS', 'RC'): (777600, 259200), # 9 days, SD 3 days (3*86400).

('SS', 'DT'): (1,425,600, 432,000), # 16.5 days (14 days?), but let's say 16 days: 1,382,400 (16 days), SD 5 days (432,000).

('RC', 'DT'): (648,000, 172,800. # 7.5 days (648,000), SD 2 days (172,800).

('SS', 'QI'): (10 days  864,000, SD 3 days (259200).

('PK', 'DT'): (3.5 days? From PK to WS (0.5) then 3 days to DT  total 4 days (345,600 sec?), so (345,600, 115,200).

Wait, PK to DT is PK to WS (0.5) and then WS to DT (3), so total 3.5 days  302,400 seconds (3.5*86400). 3.5*86400 = 302,400. So (302400, 100,000? Maybe SD 1.5 days (129600).

Alternatively, maybe I should go with the numbers as I initially thought.

Another pair like (SS, WS): 13.5 days (1,166,400 sec), SD 3 days.

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects some pairs like (SS, DT), and (SS, AS).

Also, maybe (WS, AS) would be the time from WS to AS is 3+14 (DT to AS's 14 days?), but the pair (WS, AS) would be WS to DT (3) plus DT to AS (14), so 17 days (1,451,520?), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, the temporal distance between WS and AS is the time from WS to AS. Since the path is WS  DT  AS, so the time between WS and DT is 3 days, then DT to AS 14 days, total 17 days. But the temporal distance between WS and AS can vary. So average 17 days (1,468,800 seconds), SD 5 days (432,000).

Alternatively, perhaps the temporal distance for (WS, AS) would be the time from when WS occurs until AS occurs. So it's the time from WS to DT (3 days) plus DT to AS (14)  17 days, but the SD might be high.

But maybe for simplicity, pick a few of these.

Let me try to compile a dictionary with around 10-12 entries, including some direct and indirect pairs.

Also, maybe include some other pairs like (SS, PK) or (CA, WS).

Wait, for example, ('CA', 'DT') would be the time from Component Assembly to Distribution, which is the time from CA to DT. The steps after CA are PT, PK, then the rest. Let's see:

CA to PT: 1 day, PT to PK 1, PK to WS 0.5, WS to DT 3  total 5.5 days. So 475,200 sec (5.5*86400=475,200. SD maybe 1.5 days (129,600).

Alternatively, perhaps some other pairs like (SS, CA): the time from SS to CA is the steps from SS to CA. Let's see: SS to OP (2) + OP to RC (7) + RC steps to CA (1+1=2 days)  total 10 days (864,000), SD 3 days (259,200).

Alternatively, the user might prefer a variety.

Let me try to write the entries step by step:

Sample entries:

('SS', 'OP'): (172800 (2 days), 86400),

('OP', 'RC'): (604800 (7 days), 172800 (2 days SD),

('RC', 'QI'): (86400 (1 day), 43200 (0.5 days SD),

('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 43200),

('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200),

('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 43200),

('PK', 'WS'): (43200 (0.5 days), 21600),

('WS', 'DT'): (259200 (3 days), 86400),

('DT', 'AS'): (1209600 (14 days), 518400 (6 days SD),

Then indirect pairs:

('SS', 'RC'): (777600 (9 days), 259200 (3 days SD),

('SS', 'DT'): (1, 42 days? Wait earlier calculation was 16.5 days (14 days?) Let's say 15 days (1,296,000 sec), SD 5 days (432,000).

('SS', 'AS'): (15+14=29 days? Let's say 28 days (24,192,000 sec? Wait 28 *86400=2,419,200 seconds. SD 7 days (604,800).

Wait maybe 28 days is too much, perhaps the AS is triggered later, but maybe the temporal distance is longer. Let's say 25 days (2,160,000 seconds?), but perhaps better to pick averages based on the path.

Alternatively, perhaps the temporal distance between SS and AS is 29 days (total process time up to DT plus the DT to AS. If the process takes 16.5 days (from SS to DT), then AS after 14, total 30.5 days. So 30.5 *86400 = 26,35200 sec, SD 10 days (864,000).

Hmm, but the numbers need to be in the dictionary as tuples.

Also, another pair like ('SS', 'WS'): time from SS to WS is up to WS. The days would be up to WS. Let's see:

SS to WS is:

SS to OP (2) + OP to RC (7) + RC to QI (1), QI to CA (1), CA to PT (1), PT to PK (1), PK to WS (0.5). Total 2+7+1+1+1+1+0.5 = 13.5 days  1,166,400 seconds, SD 3 days (259,200).

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the most critical pairs and some key indirect ones.

Perhaps include pairs like:

('SS', 'DT'), ('SS', 'AS'), ('RC', 'DT'), ('SS', 'WS'), ('QI', 'DT'), ('CA', 'DT').

Alternatively, also include some other like (RC, PK): the time from RC to PK includes all steps between them. RC to PK is RC to QI (1), QI to CA (1), etc up to PK. That's 1+1+1+1+1 (from PT to PK)  5 days (432,000 sec). So ('RC', 'PK')  5 days (432,000), SD 2 days (172,800).

Alternatively, perhaps including some of these.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects pairs like (SS, DT) and (SS, AS).

Also, perhaps (SS, DT) would be a good example of a non-adjacent pair.

Also, pairs like (SS, QI) would be 2 (SS-OP) +7 (OP-RC) +1 (RC-QI)  total 1
