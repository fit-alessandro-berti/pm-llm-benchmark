Below is a structured approach to analyzing and improving the order fulfillment process—particularly focusing on the challenges posed by instance-spanning constraints (shared cold-packing stations, shipping batch dependencies, priority handling, and hazardous material concurrency limits). Each section corresponds to a key element of the analysis and optimization effort.


1. IDENTIFYING INSTANCE-SPANNING CONSTRAINTS AND THEIR IMPACT


1.1 Constraints and How to Detect Them in the Event Log

• Shared Cold-Packing Stations  
  – Detection: Identify all orders flagged “Requires Cold Packing” and analyze timestamps when they start “Packing” at cold stations (e.g., Station C1, C2, … C5). The event log will show resource contention if multiple cold-eligible orders arrive at roughly the same time but must queue because only a few cold stations are available.  
  – Impact Indicator: Waiting times before “Packing (Start)” for cold-required orders; frequency of station “idle” vs. “overloaded” states.

• Shipping Batches  
  – Detection: Look for timestamps of “Shipping Label Generation” and observe if some orders’ starts or completions are significantly delayed until other orders (same destination region) complete previous steps. The log might mark a “System (Batch Bx)” resource to indicate batch label creation.  
  – Impact Indicator: Time lag between “Quality Check (Complete)” and “Shipping Label Generation (Start)”; number of orders per batch; average and maximum waiting time for a batch to fill.

• Priority Order Handling (Express Orders)  
  – Detection: Track orders flagged as “Express” and examine transitions into critical steps (e.g., Packing). Look for resource preemption events (e.g., standard order’s Packing paused/stopped or reallocated because an express order arrived).  
  – Impact Indicator: Delays experienced by standard orders (e.g., mid-activity interruption, requeueing time), time saved for express orders.

• Hazardous Material Limits  
  – Detection: Identify orders with “Hazardous Material = TRUE” and examine concurrency constraints in Packing and Quality Check activities. The event log can show simultaneous active hazard orders. If more than 10 appear at once, that indicates a rule violation or a forced queue.  
  – Impact Indicator: Count of concurrent hazardous orders in Packing or Quality Check; additional waiting time if the concurrency limit (10) is reached.

1.2 Quantifying the Impact of Each Constraint

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics:
• Waiting Time for Cold-Packing:  
  – “Packing (Start) Time” – “Previous Activity (Complete) Time” for cold-required orders.  
• Waiting Time for Batch Formation:  
  – “Shipping Label Gen. (Start) Time” – “Quality Check (Complete) Time.”  
• Delays Due to Priority Interruptions:  
  – For standard orders: “Resource Idle Time,” “Interruption Duration,” or “Re-queue Time” when an express order preempts.  
• Throughput Reduction from Hazardous Material Limits:  
  – Frequency of hitting the 10-order concurrency limit; queue times for hazardous orders if capacity is reached.

1.3 Differentiating Within-Instance vs. Between-Instance Delays

• Within-Instance Delays:  
  – Long activity durations (e.g., especially complex packing tasks for a single order), rework loops if an item fails Quality Check for that same order.  
  – Measured by analyzing durations purely within a single order instance from “Activity Start” to “Activity Complete.”

• Between-Instance Delays:  
  – Queues formed due to busy cold stations, waiting for shipping batches, or being preempted by higher-priority orders.  
  – Measured by comparing an order’s earliest possible start time (if the resource were free) to its actual start time (because the resource was occupied by another order, or the batch was still forming).

By reconstructing the process with a process mining tool and applying conformance or performance analytics, analysts can break down each order’s “inactive” time into sub-causes (resource-blocked, batch-wait, hazard-limit queue, etc.).


2. ANALYZING CONSTRAINT INTERACTIONS


2.1 Interplay of Express Orders and Limited Cold-Packing

• If an express order also requires cold-packing, it not only limits cold station capacity but also triggers priority preemption. Standard cold orders may be forced to wait longer than usual.  
• High concurrency of express cold-required orders can create significant bottlenecks, especially during peak times.  

2.2 Batching vs. Hazardous Material Concurrency

• Multiple hazardous orders heading to the same region might try to complete Packing and Quality Check in parallel. Because only 10 hazardous material orders can be processed simultaneously, queue buildup could delay these hazardous orders reaching the “Shipping Label Generation” step in time to form a batch.  
• Large shipping batches of hazardous orders may compound the concurrency limit, as multiple hazardous orders crowd the same time window.

2.3 Why Understanding Interactions Is Critical

• Resolving a cold-packing bottleneck in isolation (e.g., adding more cold stations) might improve flow but could cause more rapid arrival of hazardous materials at Quality Check, testing the concurrency limit.  
• Batching logic must consider both priority orders (to not delay them unnecessarily) and concurrency constraints (to avoid large spikes of hazardous orders).  
• Failure to account for these interactions can cause unintended queue shifts or new bottlenecks.


3. DEVELOPING CONSTRAINT-AWARE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES


Below are three distinct strategies to address and mitigate these instance-spanning constraints.

3.1 Dynamic Resource Allocation for Shared Stations

• Constraints Addressed: Cold-Packing Station Contention; Priority Handling Interruptions.  
• Proposed Changes:  
  – Implement a real-time scheduling system that monitors queue lengths at standard packing stations versus cold-packing stations. When the queue for cold-packing grows beyond a threshold, the system can temporarily reconfigure one standard station (if feasible) for cold packing.  
  – For express orders, define rules such that only if a standard order is near completion (e.g., < 2 minutes left) do we let it finish instead of immediately preempting it. Otherwise, preemption stands.  
• Data/Analysis Leverage:  
  – Use historical logs to determine average handling time per station type and peak concurrency rates.  
  – Simulate potential scenarios to identify the threshold for reassigning stations.  
• Expected Outcomes:  
  – Reduced queue time at cold stations; fewer disruptions to standard orders.  
  – Balanced utilization across all packing stations.

3.2 Revised Batching Logic with Dynamic Triggers

• Constraints Addressed: Shipping Batch Delays; Priority Handling; Hazardous Concurrency (indirectly).  
• Proposed Changes:  
  – Instead of waiting to form large homogeneous batches by destination, introduce a maximum wait threshold (e.g., 15 minutes). If that threshold is reached, generate the shipping labels for the orders that have completed Quality Check.  
  – Allow “express” and “hazardous” orders to bypass certain batch waits if their lead times approach a violation of delivery or safety constraints.  
  – Provide an option for partial shipping batch generation if a queue of hazardous orders is waiting, but the concurrency limit is also approaching for the next step.  
• Data/Analysis Leverage:  
  – Predict typical arrival patterns of orders for each region using historical data.  
  – Calculate cost/benefit of smaller, more frequent batches vs. large consolidated batches.  
• Expected Outcomes:  
  – Faster shipping label generation for completed orders; fewer orders stuck waiting on slow-arriving batch partners.  
  – Ability to handle priority and hazardous orders more flexibly without impacting the entire batch.

3.3 Hazardous Material Scheduling and Capacity Adjustments

• Constraints Addressed: Hazardous Material Concurrency (max 10).  
• Proposed Changes:  
  – Introduce a planning mechanism that schedules start times for Packing/Quality Check for hazardous orders to avoid hitting the concurrency cap. For example, staggering arrivals in smaller waves.  
  – If feasible, train additional staff or expand the specialized area so that, under safe regulatory guidelines, slightly more hazardous orders can be processed concurrently (if rules or capacity expansions allow).  
  – Implement a priority system among hazardous orders themselves, ensuring that those nearing shipping deadlines (or express + hazardous) do not get bottlenecked.  
• Data/Analysis Leverage:  
  – Historical concurrency patterns to identify typical time slots with high hazard-material density.  
  – Analysis of order lead times to decide optimal sequencing.  
• Expected Outcomes:  
  – Smoother flow for hazardous orders; fewer peaks reaching concurrency limits.  
  – Less waiting time for both hazardous and non-hazardous orders due to improved scheduling distribution.


4. SIMULATION AND VALIDATION


4.1 Simulation Approach

• Construct a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) Model:  
  – Define processes for each activity (Item Picking, Packing, Quality Check, Shipping Label Generation) with realistic durations and resource constraints.  
  – Model instance-spanning constraints:  
    1. Limited cold-packing stations.  
    2. Shipping batch logic with dynamic triggers.  
    3. Express priority preemption rules.  
    4. Hazardous concurrency limit of 10.  
• Input Data:  
  – Use the last three months of event log data for arrival rates, order types, hazard percentages, typical process durations, and resource availability patterns.

4.2 Evaluation of Proposed Strategies

• Configure multiple simulation “scenarios” corresponding to each optimization strategy and a baseline scenario (current process).  
• KPIs to Track in Simulation:  
  – Average total lead time (Order Received  Shipping Label Generation).  
  – Resource utilization rates at each station type.  
  – Queue length and waiting times, broken down by constraint cause (cold station queue, batch formation delay, express preemption, hazardous concurrency limit).  
  – On-time delivery performance (percentage of orders meeting target shipping times).  

4.3 Ensuring Realistic Representation of Constraints

• In the model logic, impose the concurrency caps strictly (no more than 10 hazardous items in Packing/QC simultaneously).  
• Implement rules to let express orders preempt resources, measure the cost of re-queuing standard orders.  
• Reflect batch formation triggers (time-based or density-based) and ensure that some orders wait if they share a shipping region.


5. MONITORING POST-IMPLEMENTATION


5.1 Key Metrics and Dashboards

• Real-Time Resource Utilization:  
  – Display the occupancy rate of cold-packing stations vs. standard stations.  
  – Track any changes over time after implementing dynamic resource allocation.  
• Average and Maximum Queue Times Pre-Packing, Pre-QC, and Pre-Shipping Label:  
  – Specifically label these queues by cause: shared resource, batch wait, priority interruption.  
• Hazard Concurrency Tracking:  
  – Ongoing monitor of how often the system reaches the concurrency limit (and how long it stays at that limit).  
• Turnaround Time for Each Order Type:  
  – Standard, Express, Hazardous, and Cold-required orders each having separate cycle time dashboards.  

5.2 Assessing Effectiveness of Constraint Management

• Compare Pre- and Post-Implementation Performance:  
  – Look for reduced wait times at bottlenecks and improved on-time shipping rates.  
• Continuous Conformance Checking:  
  – Use process mining’s conformance analysis to detect if the new policies (e.g., partial batch triggers, resource reallocation) are being followed.  
  – If deviations are frequent, refine the policy or investigate the root cause.  
• Adaptive Feedback Loop:  
  – As seasonal demand changes, collect new data and adjust policies (e.g., station reallocation thresholds or maximum wait times for batch formation).


CONCLUSION


By systematically identifying instance-spanning constraints in the event data (shared cold-packing, batching, priority handling, hazardous material concurrency) and analyzing their interactions, the fulfillment center can devise targeted optimizations. Employing process mining to isolate “between-instance” waiting times versus purely “within-instance” delays guides more accurate bottleneck identification. The three proposed strategies—dynamic resource allocation for stations, revised batching logic, and improved hazardous material scheduling—are all aimed at reducing these cross-order delays. Thorough simulation (with discrete-event modeling) ensures that each strategy’s impact on key performance indicators can be validated before rollout. Finally, a robust monitoring framework using process mining dashboards will track the effectiveness of these interventions over time, ensuring that the instance-spanning constraints are managed effectively and delivery performance improves in a sustainable manner.
