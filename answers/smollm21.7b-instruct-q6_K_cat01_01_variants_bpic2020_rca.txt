To identify the root causes of performance issues in the process, let's go through each variant step by step:

1. Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration APPROVED by EMPLOYEE:
   - Frequency: 4618
   - Performance: 810187.903

   This process has a high frequency of executions, which suggests that this stage is frequently executed and may be contributing to the overall performance issue.

2. Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION:
   - Frequency: 2473
   - Performance: 1084338.407

   The performance of this process is relatively high, but it still has a higher frequency than the previous stage. This may indicate that there are multiple instances of this process being executed simultaneously.

3. Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER:
   - Frequency: 1392
   - Performance: 854633.975

   Similar to the previous stage, this process also has a high frequency of executions and may be contributing to the performance issue.

4. Declaration SUBMITTED -> Request Payment:
   - Frequency: 134
   - Performance: 0.000

   This process appears to have minimal or no impact on performance, which is expected as it doesn't involve any complex execution steps.

Based on these observations, the potential root causes for the performance issues could be related to the high frequency of executions in stages 1 and 2 (Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration APPROVED by EMPLOYEE and Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION), which may be contributing to resource utilization or bottlenecks. Additionally, it's possible that there are multiple instances of these stages being executed simultaneously, further exacerbating the performance issue.

However, without more information about the process, such as its complexity and any potential bottlenecks or constraints, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact root causes for the performance issues. Further analysis or investigation would be required to identify the specific causes and develop a solution.
