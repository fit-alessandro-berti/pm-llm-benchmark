# Advanced Process Mining-Driven Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### Process Flow Reconstruction and Analysis

**Event Log Processing and Flow Discovery:**
I would employ a multi-layered process mining approach to reconstruct actual job flows:

- **Process Discovery using Alpha Algorithm or Inductive Miner:** Extract process models for each job type or product family, revealing the actual routing patterns versus planned routings
- **Directly-Follows Graph (DFG) Analysis:** Identify the most frequent task sequences and detect routing variations or exceptions
- **Conformance Checking:** Compare discovered models against standard operating procedures to identify deviations

**Temporal Analysis Framework:**
Create time-based process views by segmenting the event log into time windows (daily, weekly, monthly) to identify temporal patterns in scheduling performance.

### Specific Process Mining Techniques and Metrics

**Flow Time and Lead Time Analysis:**
- **Case Duration Analysis:** Calculate job completion times from "Job Released" to final "Quality Inspection End" events
- **Throughput Time Distribution Mining:** Use statistical process mining to identify lead time distributions by job complexity, priority, and routing patterns
- **Makespan Analysis:** For each time period, calculate the time from first job start to last job completion to understand overall production efficiency

**Queue Time and Waiting Analysis:**
- **Queue Mining:** Extract waiting times by measuring duration between "Queue Entry" and "Setup Start" events for each resource
- **Resource Utilization Patterns:** Calculate productive time ratios:
  ```
  Utilization = (Setup Time + Processing Time) / Total Available Time
  Setup Ratio = Setup Time / (Setup Time + Processing Time)
  ```
- **Starvation Analysis:** Identify periods where machines are idle due to lack of work using gap analysis between task completion and next task start

**Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Analysis:**
Implement a sophisticated setup time mining approach:

1. **Setup Sequence Extraction:** For each machine, create ordered sequences of jobs with their characteristics (material type, part family, tooling requirements)
2. **Setup Time Regression Analysis:** Build predictive models:
   ```
   Setup_Time = f(Previous_Job_Type, Current_Job_Type, Tool_Change_Required, 
                  Fixture_Change_Required, Time_Since_Last_Similar_Job)
   ```
3. **Setup Matrix Construction:** Create transition matrices showing average setup times between different job types

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### Fundamental Limitations Analysis

**Static Rule Limitations:**
- **Dynamic Environment Mismatch:** Current rules don't adapt to changing shop floor conditions, machine availability, or varying job mix
- **Local Optimization Trap:** Each work center optimizes locally without considering global impact, leading to suboptimal system performance
- **Information Latency:** Decisions made on outdated information due to lack of real-time integration

**Process Mining-Based Root Cause Differentiation:**

**Scheduling Logic vs. Capacity Issues:**
1. **Capacity Utilization Analysis:** If bottleneck resources consistently operate at >85% utilization, issues may be capacity-related
2. **Schedule Efficiency Analysis:** Compare actual performance against theoretical optimal schedules using the same capacity constraints
3. **Variability Analysis:** High coefficient of variation in processing times may indicate process issues rather than scheduling issues

**Real-Time Visibility Gaps:**

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules (EDDR)

**Core Logic:**
Implement multi-factor dynamic dispatching rules that adapt in real-time based on current shop floor conditions:

```
Priority_Score = w1 × Slack_Ratio + w2 × Bottleneck_Impact + w3 × Setup_Efficiency + 
                 w4 × Downstream_Congestion + w5 × Historical_Delay_Risk

Where:
- Slack_Ratio = (Due_Date - Current_Time) / Remaining_Processing_Time
- Bottleneck_Impact = Processing_Time_at_Bottleneck / Total_Remaining_Time
- Setup_Efficiency = 1 / Predicted_Setup_Time_for_Current_Sequence
- Downstream_Congestion = Queue_Length_at_Next_Operations
- Historical_Delay_Risk = P(Delay | Job_Characteristics, Current_Conditions)
```

**Process Mining Integration:**
- **Weight Calibration:** Use machine learning on historical event data to optimize weights w1-w5
- **Setup Time Prediction:** Leverage mined setup transition matrices for accurate setup time estimation
- **Delay Risk Modeling:** Build predictive models using historical job characteristics and their delay patterns

1. **Predictive Task Duration Modeling:**
   ```
   Task_Duration ~ Lognormal(, ) where ,  = f(Operator_Skill, Job_Complexity, 
                                                   Machine_Condition, Time_of_Day)
   ```

2. **Proactive Bottleneck Prediction:** Use Monte Carlo simulation to identify probable future bottlenecks 2-4 hours ahead

3. **Dynamic Schedule Regeneration:** Automatically regenerate schedules when predicted performance deviates significantly from targets

### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization through Intelligent Batching (STOIB)

**Core Logic:**
Implement a two-tier scheduling approach separating sequence optimization from timing optimization:

1. **Job Clustering:** Group jobs by setup similarity using hierarchical clustering on job characteristics
2. **Sequence Optimization:** Within clusters, use traveling salesman problem (TSP) algorithms to minimize total setup time
3. **Batch Timing Optimization:** Schedule optimized batches considering due dates and resource availability

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Minimize: (Setup_Time[i,j] × X[i,j]) +  × (Tardiness[k])
Subject to: Capacity constraints, Due date constraints, Precedence constraints
Where X[i,j] = 1 if job j follows job i on the same machine
```
