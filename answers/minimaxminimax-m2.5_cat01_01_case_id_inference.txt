The problem: We need to group the events into cases (patient journeys). There is no explicit case ID. However, we have event attributes that allow grouping. We need to consider attributes like patient_age, gender, department, and especially activities sequence (e.g., registration then triage etc.) The events are interleaved across three patients: likely three separate cases. Let's examine each line: 
1. Register patient at ER, age45 M. 
2. Register patient at ER, age62 F. 
3. Register patient at Surgery, age28 M. So we have three distinct patients (maybe three cases). Then subsequent events must align: For case of patient age45 M: 
- 4: Initial triage (age45 M). 
- 7: X-ray imaging (age45 M). 
- 12: Doctor consultation (age45 M). 
- 15: Patient discharged (age45 M). That seems like a case.

Case for patient age62 F:
- 5: Initial triage (age62 F). 
- 8: Lab test requested (age62 F). 
- 10: Lab test completed (age62 F). 
- 11: Doctor consultation (age62 F). 
- 14: Prescription created (age62 F). 
- 17: Patient discharged (age62 F). That matches.

Case for patient age28 M (Surgery):
- 3: Register patient (Surgery). 
- 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery) (though it's also called "Doctor consultation" but with reason=scheduled_knee_surgery, that seems like a pre-op consult). 
- 9: Surgery preparation. 
- 13: Surgery performed. 
- 16: Recovery room. 
- 18: Patient discharged. Also maybe some discharge? Indeed event 18 is discharge.

Thus grouping is straightforward: we assign case IDs: case1 for age45 M; case2 for age62 F; case3 for age28 M.

We could perhaps name them as case1, case2, case3. Or assign "Case A", "Case B", "Case C" accordingly.

We need to output case IDs and list of event numbers per case. Likely they'd want something like:

- Case #1 (patient_age 45, male): events 1,4,7,12,15.
- Case #2 (patient_age 62, female): events 2,5,8,10,11,14,17.
- Case #3 (patient_age 28, male): events 3,6,9,13,16,18.

But check if any events may belong to other cases incorrectly: Check events 2 is registration for 62F; 5 is triage; 8 is lab test requested; 10 lab test completed; 11 doctor consultation; 14 prescription; 17 discharge. Yes consistent.

Check events for case3: 3 registration; 6 doctor consultation; 9 surgery preparation; 13 surgery performed; 16 recovery room; 18 discharge.

Thus the answer: 3 separate cases.

Maybe we can also produce a table: case ID, patient attributes, events.

Thus final answer: we can assign case IDs: C001 for age45M; C002 for age62F; C003 for age28M.

The answer can be in plain text.

We also might discuss any ambiguous grouping. Let's double-check if any events could be ambiguous: e.g., the 'Doctor consultation' at 08:13:00 for case3; then 'Doctor consultation' at 08:22:54 for case2 and at 08:23:10 for case1. These have same activity but different patients. So they are clearly separated.

One could also consider department attribute: the 'Register patient' events are for two different departments: ER for cases 1 and 2, Surgery for case3. That also helps.

Thus answer is straightforward.

Also might need to ensure that events are in chronological order within each case.

Thus final answer: grouping: 

Case 1: events 1,4,7,12,15 (and maybe include any additional events like "X-ray imaging"? Already included.)

Case 2: events 2,5,8,10,11,14,17.

Case 3: events 3,6,9,13,16,18.

One might ask: Should we also include event numbers for other attributes: e.g., "Lab test requested" is event 8, then "Lab test completed" is event 10.

Thus final answer: Provide grouping.

I think they want something like:

Case A (45-year-old male) - includes events 1,4,7,12,15.

Case B (62-year-old female) - includes events 2,5,8,10,11,14,17.

Case C (28-year-old male) - includes events 3,6,9,13,16,18.

Thus answer.

I'll also mention that case IDs can be arbitrary, but we use #1, #2, #3.

We can also illustrate in a table:

| Case | Patient age | Gender | Department (initial) | Event numbers |
|------|-------------|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 45 | M | ER | 1,4,7,12,15 |
| 2 | 62 | F | ER | 2,5,8,10,11,14,17 |
| 3 | 28 | M | Surgery | 3,6,9,13,16,18 |

Yes. Also note that event 6 is "Doctor consultation" but it's in Surgery department

**Inferred case groupings**

The 18 events can be split into three distinct patient journeys.  
The grouping is based on the combination of **patient_age+patient_gender** (which is unique for each patient) and the logical flow of activities (registration  triage  …  discharge).

| Case ID | Patient (agegender) | First department | Event numbers (in chronological order) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Case1** | 45yearoldMale | ER (registration) | 1  4  7  12  15 |
| **Case2** | 62yearoldFemale | ER (registration) | 2  5  8  10  11  14  17 |
| **Case3** | 28yearoldMale | Surgery (registration) | 3  6  9  13  16  18 |

**Explanation**

- **Case1 (45M)** – starts with *Register patient* (event1) in the ER, followed by *Initial triage*, *Xray imaging*, *Doctor consultation* (diagnosis of hairline fracture), and ends with *Patient discharged* (event15).  
- **Case2 (62F)** – begins with *Register patient* (event2) in the ER, then *Initial triage*, *Lab test requested/completed*, *Doctor consultation* (diagnosis of minor infection), *Prescription created*, and finally *Patient discharged* (event17).  
- **Case3 (28M)** – starts with *Register patient* (event3) in the Surgery department, proceeds with *Doctor consultation* (preop), *Surgery preparation*, *Surgery performed* (arthroscopy), *Recovery room*, and ends with *Patient discharged* (event18).

All other attributes (timestamp, department, resource, additional_info) are consistent with these three sequences, confirming that the events belong to three separate cases.
