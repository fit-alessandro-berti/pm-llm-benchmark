To identify the root causes of performance issues in the given process based on the provided directly-follows graph, we need to analyze patterns and anomalies in event frequencies and durations. Here are some key observations and potential root causes:

### 1. **Handling Unit:**
   - **"Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck"**: 
     - **Duration**: 7820.93 seconds (approximately 2.17 hours).
     - This is a relatively long duration, which could indicate inefficiencies in the collection process or loading process.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Inefficient resource allocation (e.g., not enough forklifts or workers).
       - Bottlenecks in the goods collection area.
       - Poor scheduling of trucks.

### 2. **Truck:**
   - **"Load Truck" -> "Load Truck"**: 
     - **Frequency (events)**: 8559
     - **Duration**: 5259.71 seconds (approximately 1.46 hours).
     - This suggests a high frequency of repeated loading activities, which could indicate inefficiencies or errors in the loading process.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Incorrect initial loading that requires re-loading.
       - Miscommunication between different teams involved in loading.
   - **"Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck"**: 
     - **Duration**: 84119.09 seconds (approximately 23.37 hours).
     - This is a very long duration, suggesting significant delays in the process.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Traffic congestion or route inefficiencies.
       - Delays at the terminal due to lack of available loading bays.

### 3. **Container:**
   - **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container"**: 
     - **Duration**: 368943.92 seconds (approximately 4.27 days).
     - This is a very long duration, indicating significant delays in the process of ordering and picking up empty containers.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Supplier delays in delivering empty containers.
       - Inefficient order processing or communication issues with suppliers.
   - **"Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay"**: 
     - **Duration**: 743380.51 seconds (approximately 8.6 days).
     - This is a very long duration, suggesting significant delays in moving containers from stock to the loading bay.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Inefficient storage and retrieval processes.
       - Lack of space or poor organization in the stock area.
   - **"Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle"**: 
     - **Duration**: 177997.60 seconds (approximately 2.06 days).
     - This is a long duration, indicating delays in rescheduling and loading containers.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Inefficient rescheduling processes.
       - Lack of coordination between different teams involved in rescheduling.

### 4. **Vehicle:**
   - **"Book Vehicles" -> "Load to Vehicle"**: 
     - **Duration**: 283101.01 seconds (approximately 3.28 days).
     - This is a very long duration, suggesting significant delays between booking vehicles and loading them.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Inefficient vehicle allocation process.
       - Delays in the arrival of booked vehicles.
   - **"Reschedule Container" -> "Book Vehicles"**: 
     - **Duration**: 22237.92 seconds (approximately 6.18 hours).
     - This is a relatively long duration, indicating delays in rescheduling and re-booking vehicles.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Inefficient rescheduling processes.
       - Poor communication between teams involved in rescheduling.

### 5. **Forklift:**
   - **"Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay"**: 
     - **Duration**: 112600.53 seconds (approximately 1.3 days).
     - This is a very long duration, suggesting significant delays in moving containers from stock to the loading bay.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Inefficient forklift operations.
       - Poor organization and retrieval processes in the stock area.

### 6. **Customer Order:**
   - **"Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document"**: 
     - **Duration**: 329005.22 seconds (approximately 3.81 days).
     - This is a very long duration, indicating significant delays in processing customer orders.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Inefficient order processing systems.
       - Delays in communication or data entry processes.

### 7. **Transport Document:**
   - **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart"**: 
     - **Duration**: 1007066.16 seconds (approximately 11.64 days).
     - This is a very long duration, suggesting significant delays in the entire process from ordering empty containers to departure.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Supplier delays.
       - Inefficient order processing and communication.
   - **"Depart" -> "Reschedule Container"**: 
     - **Duration**: 255614.86 seconds (approximately 2.96 days).
     - This is a long duration, indicating significant delays in rescheduling after departure.
     - **Possible Root Causes**:
       - Inefficient rescheduling processes.
       - Delays in communication or coordination.

### Summary of Root Causes:
- **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Not enough forklifts, trucks, or workers.
- **Bottlenecks and Delays**: In collection areas, loading bays, and stock areas.
- **Supplier Delays**: Long delays in receiving empty containers.
- **Poor Communication and Coordination**: Between different teams and processes.
- **Inefficient Processes**: Order processing, rescheduling, and vehicle allocation.

Addressing these root causes through process improvements, better resource management, and enhanced communication can significantly improve the overall performance of the logistics process.
