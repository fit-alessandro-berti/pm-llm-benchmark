## 1) Normative-rule compliance (strict / must-hold)

### Case 1 — **Compliant**
**Observed sequence:**  
Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case

**Why it’s compliant:**  
- Credit Check precedes Risk Assessment.  
- Risk Assessment precedes Loan Decision.  
- Inform Applicant occurs after the decision.  
- Approval path includes Finalize Documentation **before** Close Case.  
- No contradictory actions.

---

### Case 2 — **Violates normative rules**
**Violations:**
1. **Ordering violation:** Risk Assessment occurs **before** Credit Check.  
   - Required: Credit Check  Risk Assessment  
   - Actual: Risk Assessment (08:20)  Credit Check (09:00)

2. **Contradictory action after rejection:** Finalize Documentation occurs **after** Loan Decision (Rejected).  
   - Required for rejection: **Close Case without** finalizing documentation  
   - Actual: Loan Decision (Rejected) 09:30  Finalize Documentation 10:00  Close Case 10:30

**Conclusion:** Case 2 is non-compliant with the mandatory process logic.

---

### Case 3 — **Compliant (normatively)**
**Observed sequence:**  
Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case

**Why it’s compliant:**  
All mandatory ordering constraints and the “approved  finalize before close” rule are satisfied. Timing issues do **not** affect normative compliance here (they belong to desiderata).

---

## 2) Desiderata (recommended / nice-to-have) deviations

### Desiderata checks referenced
- **Credit Check within 24 hours** of Application Received (recommended).  
- **Inform Applicant within 48 hours** of Loan Decision (recommended).  
- **Follow-up Call** sometime before Close Case (encouraged, optional).

### Case 1 — **Meets desiderata**
- Credit Check: 30 minutes after receipt (within 24h).  
- Inform Applicant: 2 hours after decision (within 48h).  
- Follow-up Call: not listed, but it’s only encouraged; absence is a mild deviation only if you treat it as expected best practice. (You didn’t flag it here, so I’ll consider Case 1 operationally “good”.)

### Case 2 — **No clear desiderata timing breach, but case is normatively invalid**
- Credit Check is within 1 hour of receipt, Inform Applicant is not recorded at all (note: **Inform Applicant is a normative requirement in your model**, but the log doesn’t show it for Case 2).  
  - If we take the log literally, **missing “Inform Applicant” would be another normative violation** because it must happen after Loan Decision.  
  - Your annotations didn’t mention it, so this may be an omission in the extracted log rather than actual execution behavior.

### Case 3 — **Fails desiderata (suboptimal but not severe)**
1. **Late Credit Check:**  
   - Application Received: 2024-01-12 09:00  
   - Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00  
   - Delay  49 hours  exceeds the recommended 24h window.

2. **Late Inform Applicant:**  
   - Loan Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00  
   - Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00  
   - Delay  51 hours  exceeds the recommended 48h window.

3. **No Follow-up Call:**  
   - Encouraged but not required  counted as a “best-practice miss,” not a serious violation.

## 3) Possible interpretations / justifications (consistent with rules vs. recommendations)

### Case 2 (normative violations) — plausible explanations
- **Data-entry / event logging delay:** The Credit Check might have been performed earlier but recorded late, making it *appear* after Risk Assessment.  
- **Parallel/exception handling not captured by the normative model:** The organization might sometimes do a *preliminary* risk triage before a formal credit check (but this would contradict the stated strict rules and should be treated as non-compliance unless the model is updated).
- **Finalize Documentation after rejection:**  
  - Could be mis-labeled activity (e.g., “Finalize Documentation” actually means “finalize rejection paperwork/archiving”). If so, the activity taxonomy needs refinement, because the current label conflicts with the strict “no finalization after rejection” rule.

### Case 3 (desiderata deviations) — plausible explanations
- **External dependency delays:** Credit check may depend on third-party bureaus, identity verification, or missing applicant documents, causing the >24h delay.  
- **Communication backlog or applicant unreachable:** Informing the applicant might have been attempted earlier but only succeeded later; the system may log “Inform Applicant” only when successful contact is confirmed.  
- **No follow-up call:** Could be intentionally skipped because the case was straightforward, or replaced by another communication channel not logged as “Follow-up Call.”

### Case 1 (ideal execution) — interpretation
- Represents the intended “happy path” execution with both normative compliance and good adherence to the recommended service-level behaviors.

---

### Summary
- **Normative violations:** **Case 2** (wrong order + finalization after rejection; and potentially missing “Inform Applicant” depending on whether the log is complete).  
- **Desiderata failures:** **Case 3** (late credit check, late informing, no follow-up call).  
- **Best overall:** **Case 1**.
