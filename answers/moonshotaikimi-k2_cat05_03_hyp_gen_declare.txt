## 1. Identified Anomalies in the DECLARE Model

### Contradiction between Existence and Non-Coexistence
- **Existence constraint** requires that activity "C" (Close Claim) must occur in every trace
- **Non-coexistence constraint** between "E" (Evaluate Claim) and "C" (Close Claim) prohibits these activities from occurring in the same trace
- This creates a paradox: "C" must exist, but the evaluation required before closing cannot coexist with it

### Precedence Constraint with Missing Dependencies
- **Precedence constraint** only requires "R" (Receive Claim) to precede "C" (Close Claim)
- This allows a trace like `["R", "C"]` without any of the required intermediate steps (Assign, Evaluate, Approve, Notify)

### Responded Existence without Enforcement
- **Responded existence** requires that if "E" (Evaluate) occurs, then "A" (Assign) must have occurred
- However, the non-coexistence between "E" and "C" makes this irrelevant, as any trace with "E" cannot contain "C", making the trace incomplete

## 2. Hypotheses for Model Anomalies

**Policy Drift Scenario**: The organization initially required evaluation to be the final step before claim resolution, but later added a separate closing procedure without updating the non-coexistence constraint.

**Decentralized Requirements**: Different teams may have contributed constraints independently - a compliance team ensuring proper evaluation requirements while operations focused on faster claim resolution.

**Misinterpretation of Business Rules**: The non-coexistence constraint might have been intended to prevent evaluation AFTER closing (not completely prohibiting coexistence), but was expressed incorrectly.

**Emergency Bypass Mechanism**: The model might represent a system where critical claims can be immediately closed after reception during emergencies, bypassing standard procedures.

**Data Artifact**: The constraints might be derived from historical data anomalies where evaluation events were recorded as failed or cancelled before the actual closing occurred, creating false patterns.

## 3. SQL-Based Investigation Strategies

### Checking for Close Without Evaluation
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.submission_date,
    ce_close.timestamp as close_time
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id
WHERE ce_close.activity = 'C'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM claim_events ce_eval 
    WHERE ce_eval.claim_id = c.claim_id 
    AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
);
```

### Identifying Evaluation That Precedes Closing
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    coalesce(eval.timestamp, '1900-01-01') as eval_time,
    close.timestamp as close_time
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events eval ON c.claim_id = eval.claim_id AND eval.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN claim_events close ON c.claim_id = close.claim_id AND close.activity = 'C'
WHERE eval.claim_id IS NOT NULL 
AND close.claim_id IS NOT NULL
AND eval.timestamp < close.timestamp;
```

### Verifying Assign-Evaluate Connection
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    assign.resource as assigned_adjuster,
    evaluate.resource as evaluating_resource
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events assign ON c.claim_id = assign.claim_id AND assign.activity = 'A'
JOIN claim_events evaluate ON c.claim_id = evaluate.claim_id AND evaluate.activity = 'E'
GROUP BY c.claim_id, assigned_adjuster, evaluating_resource;
```

### Checking Simple R-C Traces
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.claim_type,
    min(receive.timestamp) as receive_time,
    max(close.timestamp) as close_time,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) as distinct_activities
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events receive ON c.claim_id = receive.claim_id AND receive.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events close ON c.claim_id = close.claim_id AND close.activity = 'C'
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM claim_events ce_filter 
    WHERE ce_filter.claim_id = c.claim_id 
    AND ce_filter.activity NOT IN ('R', 'C')
)
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2;
```

### Claims Skipped Assign Phase
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.submission_date,
    eval.timestamp as eval_time
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events eval ON c.claim_id = eval.claim_id AND eval.activity = 'E'
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM claim_events assign 
    WHERE assign.claim_id = c.claim_id 
    AND assign.activity = 'A'
);
```
