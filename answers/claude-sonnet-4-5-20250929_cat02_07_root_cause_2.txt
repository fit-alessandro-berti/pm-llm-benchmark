# Performance Analysis: Insurance Claims Processing

## 1. Case Duration Analysis

Let me first calculate the total duration for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Duration | Complexity | Region |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 2001 | 2024-04-01 09:00 | 2024-04-01 10:30 | **1.5 hours** | Low | A |
| 2002 | 2024-04-01 09:05 | 2024-04-02 11:00 | **~26 hours** | Medium | B |
| 2003 | 2024-04-01 09:10 | 2024-04-03 09:30 | **~48.3 hours** | High | A |
| 2004 | 2024-04-01 09:20 | 2024-04-01 10:45 | **1.4 hours** | Low | B |
| 2005 | 2024-04-01 09:25 | 2024-04-04 14:30 | **~77 hours** | High | B |

### Cases with Performance Issues:
- **Case 2005**: 77 hours (WORST performer - 51x slower than baseline)
- **Case 2003**: 48.3 hours (32x slower than baseline)
- **Case 2002**: 26 hours (17x slower than baseline)

*Baseline: Cases 2001 & 2004 (~1.5 hours)*

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### A. **Complexity Level - PRIMARY ROOT CAUSE**

| Complexity | Avg Duration | # Additional Doc Requests | Pattern |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Low | 1.45 hours | 0 | Fast, straightforward |
| Medium | 26 hours | 1 | Moderate delay |
| High | 62.65 hours | 2-3 | Severe delays |

**Key Finding**: High complexity cases require **multiple rounds** of document requests:
- Case 2003 (High): **2 document requests** (at 11:00 and 17:00 on Day 1)
- Case 2005 (High): **3 document requests** (spanning 3 consecutive days)

**Impact**: Each additional document request cycle adds approximately 20-24 hours of delay, likely due to:
- Customer response time
- Document review cycles
- Back-and-forth communication

---

### B. **Resource Assignment - SECONDARY FACTOR**

#### Manager Assignment Patterns:
- **Manager_Ann** (Cases 2001, 2002, 2004): Handles Low/Medium complexity, approvals are timely
- **Manager_Bill** (Cases 2003, 2005): Only handles High complexity cases, showing significant delays

| Manager | Cases Handled | Avg Time to Approval |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Manager_Ann | 2001, 2002, 2004 | Quick approvals |
| Manager_Bill | 2003, 2005 | 23+ hour delays before approval |

**Potential Issues**:
- Manager_Bill may be overloaded with complex cases
- Possible bottleneck in approval authority for high-complexity claims
- May require additional scrutiny/escalation for high-value claims

#### Adjuster Performance:
- **Adjuster_Lisa** (Region B, Cases 2002, 2004, 2005): Handles 3 cases including the worst performer (2005)
- **Adjuster_Mike** (Region A, Cases 2001, 2003): More consistent performance in Region A

---

### C. **Regional Factors - MINOR INFLUENCE**

| Region | Cases | Avg Duration | Complexity Mix |
|--------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| A | 2001, 2003 | 24.9 hours | 1 Low, 1 High |
| B | 2002, 2004, 2005 | 34.5 hours | 1 Low, 1 Medium, 1 High |

**Observation**: Region B shows slightly longer average durations, but this appears **confounded by complexity distribution**. Region B handled 2 out of 3 problematic cases, but when controlling for complexity (comparing Low-complexity cases), regional differences are minimal:
- Case 2001 (Region A, Low): 1.5 hours
- Case 2004 (Region B, Low): 1.4 hours

## 3. Detailed Root Cause Summary

### **Primary Issue: Document Request Cycles in High-Complexity Cases**

**Pattern Observed**:
- **Multiple sequential document requests** create cascading delays
- Case 2005: 3 requests over 3 days (Day 1 at 11:30, Day 2 at 17:00, Day 3 at 15:00)
- Case 2003: 2 requests on Day 1 (11:00 and 17:00)

**Why This Happens**:
1. **Incomplete initial requests**: Adjusters may not identify all missing documents in first review
2. **Iterative discovery**: New information reveals need for additional documentation
3. **Customer response delays**: External dependency on claimant providing documents
4. **Sequential processing**: Each document batch requires separate review cycle

---

## 4. Recommended Mitigation Strategies

### **Immediate Actions (Quick Wins)**

1. **Upfront Document Checklist for High-Complexity Claims**
   - Create comprehensive checklists based on claim type
   - Request ALL potentially needed documents in first contact
   - Reduce from 2-3 cycles to 1 cycle
   - **Expected impact**: 40-50% reduction in high-complexity case duration

2. **Resource Rebalancing**
   - Review Manager_Bill's workload and approval queue
   - Consider splitting high-complexity approvals across multiple managers
   - Implement approval time SLAs (e.g., 4-hour review window)
   - **Expected impact**: 20-30% reduction in approval delays

3. **Proactive Customer Communication**
   - Implement automated reminders for document submission
   - Provide clear submission portals with real-time status
   - Set 24-hour response expectations
   - **Expected impact**: 15-20% faster customer response times

### **Medium-Term Improvements**

4. **Risk-Based Triage System**
   - Fast-track low-complexity claims (current baseline is good)
   - Assign dedicated specialists to high-complexity cases
   - Implement parallel processing where possible (document review + eligibility verification)

5. **Adjuster Training & Support**
   - Train Adjuster_Lisa on efficient document gathering for complex cases
   - Develop case complexity assessment tools
   - Implement peer review for initial document requests on high-complexity cases

6. **Process Automation**
   - Automated document completeness checks
   - AI-assisted initial claim evaluation to predict required documents
   - Digital document upload with validation

### **Long-Term Strategic Changes**

7. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Build models to predict complexity at submission
   - Identify patterns in document requirements by claim type
   - Proactively route cases to appropriate resources

8. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Establish KPIs: 
     - Low complexity: <4 hours
     - Medium complexity: <24 hours  
     - High complexity: <48 hours
   - Track document request cycles as key metric
   - Monitor resource utilization and bottlenecks

## 5. Expected Outcomes

Implementing these recommendations should achieve:

- **High-complexity cases**: Reduce from 62.7 hours to **<36 hours** (43% improvement)
- **Document requests**: Reduce from 2-3 cycles to **1 cycle** for 70% of complex cases
- **Overall process**: Achieve 90% of cases completed within 48 hours
- **Customer satisfaction**: Improved due to clearer expectations and faster resolution

The root cause is clear: **complexity-driven iterative document requests** create the most significant delays, with resource bottlenecks (Manager_Bill) as a secondary contributing factor.
