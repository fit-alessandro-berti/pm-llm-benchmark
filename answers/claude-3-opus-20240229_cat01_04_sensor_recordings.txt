Based on the patterns in the event log, I have identified the following groups of events that likely correspond to distinct manufacturing activities:

1. Events 1-3, 13-15: Idle/Standby
   - Temperature: ~20°C 
   - Pressure: 1 bar
   - Vibration: 0 Hz
   - Material Flow: 0 units/s
   - Tool Position: 0 mm
   - Energy: ~0.4-0.5 kWh

   These events likely represent the machine in an idle or standby state, as all sensor readings are at baseline levels with minimal energy consumption.

2. Events 4-6: Cutting Metal
   - Temperature: 50-58°C
   - Pressure: 1-1.5 bar 
   - Vibration: 30-38 Hz
   - Material Flow: 5 units/s
   - Tool Position: 5-10 mm
   - Energy: 2-3 kWh

   The elevated temperature, vibration, material flow, and energy usage, along with the changing tool position, suggest that these events correspond to a cutting operation.

3. Events 7-8: Assembling Parts
   - Temperature: 40°C
   - Pressure: 2 bar
   - Vibration: 10 Hz 
   - Material Flow: 2 units/s
   - Tool Position: 15 mm
   - Energy: 2 kWh

   The moderate and stable readings across all sensors, with reduced material flow and a fixed tool position, point to an assembly operation where parts are being put together.

4. Event 9: Welding
   - Temperature: 80°C
   - Pressure: 2 bar
   - Vibration: 50 Hz
   - Material Flow: 0 units/s
   - Tool Position: 15 mm 
   - Energy: 5 kWh

   The high temperature, vibration, and energy consumption, along with zero material flow, strongly indicate a welding operation.

5. Events 10-12: Quality Inspection
   - Temperature: 25-30°C
   - Pressure: 1 bar
   - Vibration: 1-5 Hz
   - Material Flow: 0-1 units/s 
   - Tool Position: 15-20 mm
   - Energy: 1-1.6 kWh

   The relatively low and stable readings across most sensors, with slight vibration and minimal material flow, suggest a quality inspection phase where the assembled product is being checked.

In summary, the labeled activities are:

- Idle/Standby: Events 1-3, 13-15
- Cutting Metal: Events 4-6 
- Assembling Parts: Events 7-8
- Welding: Event 9
- Quality Inspection: Events 10-12

This analysis demonstrates how process mining techniques can be applied to raw sensor data to infer meaningful activities and gain insights into a manufacturing process.
