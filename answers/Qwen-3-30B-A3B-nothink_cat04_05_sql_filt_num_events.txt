Here's a well-structured **DuckDB SQL query** that fulfills the requirements of the benchmark:

---

###  **DuckDB SQL Query: Filter Cases with  6 Events**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

---

###  **Explanation:**

- **Subquery**:
  - Groups the events by `case_id`.
  - Uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to filter out `case_id`s that have more than six events.
  - Returns only the `case_id`s that meet the condition.

- **Main Query**:
  - Selects all rows from `event_log` where the `case_id` is in the result of the subquery.
  - This effectively returns **all events** from **cases with 6 or fewer events**.

---

###  **Example Use Case:**

If `event_log` contains:

| case_id | activity | timestamp |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| 1       | A        | t1        |
| 1       | B        | t2        |
| 2       | C        | t3        |
| 2       | D        | t4        |
| 2       | E        | t5        |
| 2       | F        | t6        |
| 2       | G        | t7        |

Then the query will **exclude `case_id = 2`** (since it has 7 events), and return all rows for `case_id = 1`.

Let me know if you'd like a version that also includes the count per case or uses a `JOIN` approach.
