Let's analyze the event log for anomalies in the P2P (Procure-to-Pay) process by looking for deviations from the standard workflow.

### **Standard P2P Process Sequence (High Level Overview):**
1. **Initiation:** Employee creates a Purchase Requisition.
2. **Approval:** Purchase Requisition is reviewed/approved (usually by manager or controller).
3. **Purchase Order (PO):** PO is generated based on the requisition.
4. **Vendor Acknowledgment/Receipt:** Goods received (either goods receipt or vendor confirms receipt).
5. **Invoice Receipt:** Invoice is received from vendor.
6. **Matching:** Invoice is matched to the PO and Requisition (for accuracy).
7. **Paying:** Payment is released after approval (sometimes after matching and verification).
8. **Completion/Closure:** Case is closed after payment or other end event.

Some variations exist based on organization, but the above is a typical linear or near-linear sequence.

## **Analysis of the Event Logs**

### **Case 1001**
1. **Requisition  Approve  PO  Receive Goods  Invoice Received  Match PO  Release Payment  Close**
   - This follows the expected order.
   - **No obvious anomalies detected.**

However, there are some timing gaps between steps (e.g., between receiving goods and invoice received, and between matching and payment release), but these are not necessarily anomalies unless the timing is extremely unrealistic.

### **Case 1002**
Let's map the events in order:
1. Create Requisition (08:30)
2. Issue PO (08:40)
3. **(Jump!) Receive Goods (02-03 07:00)**
4. Vendor Invoice Received (02-03 07:15)
5. Release Payment (02-03 08:00)
6. Approve Requisition (02-04 09:00)  **This is problematic!**
7. Receive Goods (02-05 08:00)  **But goods were already received earlier?**
8. Match Invoice (02-05 08:00)
9. Close Case (02-06 16:00)

#### **Anomalies Identified:**
- **Approve Purchase Requisition before PO is issued and before goods are received?**
  - Normally, approval comes *after* the PO is created (since the requisition is based on business need, then PO is generated, then it's approved). Here, the requisition is approved before the PO is issued. While this could occur in some organizations (if PO issuance is part of the approval step), it's unusual to see the approval happen so soon after creation and before the PO is even generated. This could indicate a workflow gap or a misassignment of responsibilities.
- **Receive Goods Twice (02-03 and 05-08)?**
  - First goods receipt at 02-02 10:00, then another at 02-05 08:00 — no evidence of a second delivery, but the event log shows two separate "Receive Goods" events with no explanation. This could indicate a data entry error, duplicate entry, or possibly two deliveries (but the process flow suggests only one should be expected for a single PO).
- **Release Payment Before Matching?**
  - Release Payment at 02-03 08:00, before "Match Invoice to PO" at 02-05 08:00. In standard P2P, matching is a critical step to ensure invoice accuracy and alignment with PO and requisition — releasing payment before this step is risky and non-compliant with typical controls (e.g., 3-way match in some organizations).
  - This could lead to incorrect payments if the invoice does not match the PO/requisition.

#### **Summary of Issues in Case 1002:**
- **Approval before PO issuance**
- **Multiple Receive Goods entries without clear reason**
- **Payment released before invoice matching**
  - All of these violate best practices and could result in financial errors, fraud risk, or process non-compliance.

### **Case 1003**
Mapping the events:
1. Create Requisition (02-02 09:00)
2. Approve Requisition (02-02 09:10)
3. Issue PO (02-02 10:00)
4. (Long gap)
5. Release Payment (02-08 11:00)  **Released before receiving goods or matching invoice?**
6. Invoice Received (02-09 12:00)
7. Receive Goods (02-10 13:00)  Should this come before invoice receipt?
8. Match Invoice (02-11 14:00)
9. Close Case (02-12 10:00)

#### **Anomalies Identified:**
- **Release Payment Before Goods Receipt or Invoice Matching:**
  - Payment released on 02-08 before any evidence of goods receipt (02-10) or invoice matching (02-11). This is highly unusual and a major control failure — payment should only be released after confirming goods have been received and the invoice matches the PO.
- **Receive Goods After Invoice Received:**
  - Normally, goods receipt comes before invoice receipt (the vendor sends the invoice after delivery). Here, invoice received (12:00) comes before goods receipt (13:00), which is illogical unless the data entries are swapped or there is confusion in event logging.
- **Long Delays and Out-of-Order Steps:**
  - There are significant time gaps and process steps occurring out of sequence. This suggests potential workflow issues, lack of process discipline, or possible data entry errors.

#### **Summary of Issues in Case 1003:**
- **Payment released prematurely**
- **Incorrect order of invoice vs. goods receipt events**
- **Major process deviations and possible data integrity issues**

### **Case 1004**
Mapping events:
1. Create Requisition (05-10:00)
2. Approve Requisition (05-10:15)
3. Receive Goods (05-06 09:00)  Immediately after requisition approval and before PO issuance!
4. Issue PO (05-06 09:15)
5. Invoice Received (05-07 08:00)  Before goods received? Wait, goods received was 09:00, invoice at 08:00 — out of order.
6. Match Invoice (05-07 09:00)
7. Release Payment (05-08 11:00)

#### **Anomalies:**
- **Receive Goods Before PO Issued:**
  - Requisition approved, PO issued, but goods received before the PO is even created. This is not typical — usually the PO is issued to authorize the order, then goods are received.
- **Invoice Received Before Goods Received:**
  - Invoice event before goods event — again, the logical sequence is reversed.
- **Possible Payment Release Before Full Validation:**
  - Payment is released at 11:00 after some steps, but not sure if matching was done. However, the out-of-sequence steps suggest process gaps.

## **Summary of Anomalies and Their Implications**

### **Common Anomalies Observed Across Cases:**
1. **Early Approval or Release of Payment:**
   - Approving requisitions or releasing payments before the PO is issued or before key controls (like matching) are completed. This exposes the company to payment errors and potential fraud.
2. **Out-of-Order Event Sequencing:**
   - Receiving goods or receiving invoices before their logical predecessors (e.g., invoice before goods received, or goods received before PO).
   - These indicate data entry errors, workflow misconfigurations, or lack of process enforcement.
3. **Duplicate or Unexplained Events:**
   - Multiple "Receive Goods" events with no explanation — could be data errors or actual multiple deliveries, but needs investigation.
4. **Long Delays and Non-Conforming Timelines:**
   - Steps are taking much longer than usual or are skipped entirely, which could indicate systemic process issues or bottlenecks.

---

## **Why These Are Problematic (From a P2P and Controls Perspective):**

- **Financial Risk:** Early payment release without proper validation can result in overpayment, incorrect payments, or paying for the wrong goods.
- **Compliance Issues:** Many procurement and internal control frameworks (like SOX) require strict process sequencing and approvals before payment is authorized.
- **Reputational Damage:** These anomalies can indicate poor process management, which may affect supplier relationships and stakeholder confidence.
- **Root Cause Investigation Needed:** Such anomalies suggest the need for process mapping, user training, system configuration reviews, or potential data quality issues.

## **Recommendations / Next Steps:**

1. **Process Mapping and Gap Analysis:** Map the actual process to the standard and identify deviations.
2. **User Training and Workflow Audits:** Review user roles and permissions to ensure proper segregation of duties.
3. **System Validation:** Check for data entry errors, duplicate entries, or system misconfigurations (e.g., workflow logic).
4. **Strengthen Controls:** Implement mandatory checklists (e.g., require matching before payment) and enforce event sequencing in the ERP system.
5. **Investigate Anomalous Cases:** Look into cases 1002 and 1003 in detail — they exhibit the most severe deviations.
6. **Audit Trail Enhancement:** Ensure all events are logged with sufficient context and timestamps for traceability.

---

## **Conclusion**

The most significant anomalies are found in **Case 1002 and 1003**, where:
- Approval and payment release occur before logical process steps (PO issuance, goods receipt, invoice matching).
- Events such as receiving goods and receiving invoices are out of order.
- These deviations violate standard P2P controls and could result in financial and operational harm.

Addressing these issues is critical to restoring a robust, compliant, and accurate procurement process.
