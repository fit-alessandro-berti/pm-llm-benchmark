Anomalies  
1. Noncoexistence vs. Mandatory Closure  
   - The model’s NonCoexistence constraint forbids “E” (Evaluate) and “C” (Close) occurring in the same trace, yet an Existence constraint demands that every trace include “C.”  
   - Meanwhile, RespondedExistence forces every “A” (Assign) to be followed by an “E.” Since Assign is logically required before evaluation, any claim that proceeds normally to evaluation can never be closed—contradicting the mandatory closure rule.  

2. Impossible Workflow Completion  
   - Init enforces “R” (Receive) as the first activity, Precedence enforces that “R” precedes “C,” RespondedExistence enforces that “A” precedes “E,” and NonCoexistence forbids “E” and “C” together.  
   - Taken together, these rules make it impossible for any trace to contain all required steps from Receive through Close without violating at least one constraint.  

3. Contradictory Precedence and NonCoexistence  
   - Precedence(C, R) says you must have R before C.  
   - NonCoexistence(E, C) says you cannot have E if you have C.  
   - But business logic requires E before P before N before C—so you cannot both evaluate and close, yet you cannot close without evaluating.  

Hypotheses for Why These Anomalies Arose  
• Misinterpreted Requirements  
  – An analyst may have thought “we must block any closed claim from showing evaluation errors” and encoded that as NonCoexistence(E, C) without realizing it blocks all closures.  
• Piecemeal Policy Updates  
  – A late decision to enforce strict Quality Control (QC) might have introduced NonCoexistence(E, C) to prevent postapproval edits, but other constraints weren’t updated to match.  
• Data Sparsity or Noise  
  – If historical logs rarely captured “C” and “E” together due to logging gaps, an automated miner may have inferred a spurious noncoexistence rule.  
• SpeedOverQuality Pressure  
  – Under pressure to close claims faster, someone may have tried to allow skipping evaluation, then reversed course—leading to contradictory rules left in the model.  

SQLBased Verification Strategies  

1. Find claims that were Closed without any Evaluation  
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) > 0
  AND COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) = 0;
```

2. Find claims where Evaluation and Closing coexist (violates NonCoexistence(E,C))  
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) > 0
  AND COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) > 0;
```

3. Find claims that were Evaluated without ever being Assigned (violates RespondedExistence(AE))  
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) > 0
  AND COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN 1 END) = 0;
```

4. Identify claims that never Closed (violates Existence(C))  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'C'
) closed ON c.claim_id = closed.claim_id
WHERE closed.claim_id IS NULL;
```

5. Verify proper ordering of RAEPNC per claim  
```sql
WITH events AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='R' THEN timestamp END) AS tR,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='A' THEN timestamp END) AS tA,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='E' THEN timestamp END) AS tE,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='P' THEN timestamp END) AS tP,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='N' THEN timestamp END) AS tN,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='C' THEN timestamp END) AS tC
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT *
FROM events
WHERE 
  (tR IS NULL OR tA < tR)
  OR (tE < tA)
  OR (tP < tE)
  OR (tN < tP)
  OR (tC < tN);
```

Use these queries to detect realworld violations of the contradictory DECLARE constraints, helping you decide which rules are spurious and need revision.
