- Verify Documents
  - Initial intake check right after request submission.
  - Re-verification after the customer provides missing documents.

- Call Customer
  - To request missing documents needed for verification.
  - To clarify an account discrepancy before making adjustments.
  - To confirm that adjustments have been made.
  - To recall a walk-in customer back to the branch.

2) Renaming scheme for recurring activities

  - Verify Documents - Post-Submission Recheck
  - Verify Documents - Post-Adjustment Recheck
  - Verify Documents - Branch Intake

4) Justification of naming choices
- Verify Documents - Initial Intake: Occurs immediately after Initiate Request; first-pass document/identity check.
- Verify Documents - Post-Submission Recheck: Triggered after customer supplies missing documents (C001 Submit Additional); purpose is to re-validate with new evidence.
- Verify Documents - Post-Adjustment Recheck: Follows Adjust Account; ensures data consistency after internal changes (C003).
- Verify Documents - Branch Intake: In-branch physical verification (C003), distinct channel and resource.

- Call Customer - Request Missing Docs: Outbound call to obtain required documents for verification (C001).
- Call Customer - Clarify Discrepancy: Pre-adjustment clarification to understand the issue (C002 first call).
- Call Customer - Confirm Adjustments: Post-adjustment confirmation with the customer (C002 second call).
- Call Customer - Recall to Branch: Operational call to bring a walk-in customer back to the desk (C003), distinct purpose from verification or confirmation.
