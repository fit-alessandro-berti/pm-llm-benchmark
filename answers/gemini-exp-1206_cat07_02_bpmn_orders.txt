This is a business process diagram, likely created using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), illustrating the workflow of an order fulfillment process. It's divided into four swimlanes representing different departments:

*   **Sales:** This lane depicts the initial stages, starting on Monday morning, including checking order completeness, verifying customer information in the database, adding new customers, sending order details, and drafting invoices.
*   **Production:** This lane outlines the production process, initiated by order details arrival. It includes planning production, manufacturing the product, and handling potential material faults.
*   **Procurement:** This lane details the material procurement subprocess, triggered by order details. It involves ordering materials, handling returns, checking materials, and managing order cancellations.
*   **Warehouse:** This lane illustrates the final stage of sending the product after it's completed.

The diagram uses various BPMN symbols to represent different elements:

*   **Circles:** Represent events (start, intermediate, end).
*   **Rectangles:** Represent tasks or activities.
*   **Diamonds:** Represent gateways (decisions or parallel actions).
*   **Arrows:** Represent the flow of the process.

The diagram shows a clear sequence of events, handoffs between departments, and decision points. It provides a high-level overview of how an order is processed from the initial sales inquiry to the final product delivery.
