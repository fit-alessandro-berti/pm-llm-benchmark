### Questions to Clarify the Property Onboarding Process

1. **Initial Contact and Documentation Review**: Can you walk me through a typical example of what happens when a landlord first contacts the regional office? For instance, how do you initially assess whether their request aligns with your company's portfolio focus, and what are the most common types of missing or outdated documents that coordinators encounter?

2. **Documentation Verification**: Beyond requesting updates for missing documents, how does the property coordinator decide if a document is sufficiently "up-to-date," and what criteria or timelines do they use to prioritize urgent versus non-urgent requests from landlords?

3. **Property Details Recording**: When entering property details like square footage, amenities, or expected rental prices into the central database, how do you ensure accuracy and consistency, especially if the landlord's information conflicts with publicly available data or initial assessments?

4. **Property Manager Assignment**: What specific metrics or thresholds does the coordinator use to evaluate a property manager's "current workload" or "track record with unique requirements," and how often do factors like geographic specialization override others in the assignment decision?

5. **Introductory Meeting**: During the introductory call or meeting between the property manager and landlord, what are the key discussion points that most frequently lead to adjustments in expectations, such as pet policies or maintenance responsibilities, and how are any agreed-upon special conditions formally documented?

6. **Scheduling Inspections and Photography**: How does the property manager coordinate the timing between the photographer's visit and the certified inspector's assessment to minimize disruptions, and what qualifications or standards do you require for external photographers and inspectors?

7. **Handling Inspection Issues**: If the inspector's report identifies safety or habitability issues, can you describe the step-by-step collaboration between the property manager and landlord to resolve them? For example, under what circumstances would the company cover repair costs versus expecting the landlord to handle them entirely?

8. **Marketing Preparation**: How does the digital marketing team incorporate feedback from the property manager or landlord when creating online listings and brochures, and what market trend data sources do they rely on to adjust pricing models for a new property?

9. **Property Activation**: Once marketing materials are ready, what internal approvals or checkpoints are required before activating the property in the rental portal, and how do you handle cases where the activation reveals discrepancies in the database entries?

10. **Tenant Screening Process**: In the tenant screening phase, how do you weigh different factors like credit scores, employment verification, or previous landlord references when multiple qualified applicants are competing, and what role does the property manager play in deciding whether to pursue negotiations for lease terms?

11. **Lease Negotiation and Finalization**: When negotiating with prospective tenants—such as offering discounts or prioritizing longer leases—what guidelines does the property manager follow to balance the landlord's preferences with the company's overall profitability goals, and how are custom requests from tenants evaluated?

12. **Quality Checks and Audits**: Who typically initiates the compliance officer's review of the lease, and what are the most frequent fair housing regulation issues that arise during this step? Similarly, how does the financial analyst's verification of rental pricing interact with the property manager's input on market conditions?

13. **IT Integration**: During the IT department's check for online listing and data integration, what common integration challenges have you seen, and how are they resolved to ensure seamless access for tenants and internal teams?

14. **Exception Handling**: For properties requiring special insurance or custom lease clauses insisted upon by the landlord, how does this alter the standard sequencing of the process, and what escalation paths exist if the property manager and landlord cannot agree on these elements?

15. **Overall Timing, Sequencing, and Communication**: Across the entire onboarding lifecycle, what is the typical duration from initial contact to tenant move-in, and how do delays in one phase (e.g., inspection repairs) impact subsequent steps? Additionally, how do tools like CRMs and project management software facilitate communication among regional offices, landlords, and support teams, especially in multi-city scenarios?
