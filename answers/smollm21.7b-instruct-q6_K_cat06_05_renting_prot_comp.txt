Based on the provided data, the main differences between the treatment of protected and unprotected groups can be summarized as follows:

1. The rejection rate for protected group is significantly higher than that of the unprotected group across most process variants. For example, in Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant ( frequency = 2490), the rejected count stands at 67% of the total occurrences.

2. The rejection rate for extensive screening is higher among protected group than unprotected group for most process variants, indicating that more protective measures are being used against those who apply and get rejected multiple times. For example, in Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant ( frequency = 1022), the percentage of rejections is around 48%.

3. Protected group tends to have a higher acceptance rate than unprotected group for some process variants like Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent when compared to Repeated Application. For example, in Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent ( frequency = 156), the percentage of accepted events is around 90%.

4. While there are some process variants where protected group performs better than unprotected group, such as in Repeated Application to Apply for Viewing Appointment and Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent, the overall trend indicates a potential bias towards protecting the former group.

5. The differences are not uniform across all process variants and seem to be influenced by various factors such as rejection rates, acceptance rates, and frequency of repeated applications. However, it can be inferred that protected groups might benefit from more stringent screening mechanisms used in the system.
