--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Descriptive workload & performance metrics  
• Ticket load per agent/tier: #tickets opened, closed, currently in-progress (time-series view).  
• Effort distribution: sum of active handling time (Work Start  Work End) per agent vs. contracted capacity.  
• Average/median processing times per activity by agent and by tier (e.g., “Work L1”, “Work L2”).  
• First-Call Resolution (FCR) for L1: % tickets closed without escalation.  
• Skill utilisation ratio: time a skill is actually required on a ticket ÷ time agents possessing that skill spend working.  
• Assignment accuracy: % tickets whose first assigned agent owns the “Required Skill” attribute.

B. Organisational / social-network mining  
• Handover-of-work network: nodes = agents, edges = # of handovers; edge weight shows intensity. Thick, circular handovers inside L1  ping-pong before escalation; many edges from L1 to specific L2 specialists  potential bottlenecks.  
• Sub-contracting & working-together networks to reveal hidden collaboration patterns (e.g., L1+L2 jointly editing).  
• Role discovery / clustering: use activity & skill vectors to cluster resources; compare discovered “roles” with formal tiers to detect mis-alignment (e.g., some “L1s” acting like L2).

C. Skill-focused mining  
• Create a “skill-ticket” matrix: rows = skills, cols = # tickets requiring that skill; overlay the distribution of available agent-hours possessing each skill.  
• Analyse the path “Required Skill  First Agent Skill” to compute skill-match precision & recall.  
• Plot specialist-time spent on lower-skill tickets (e.g., L2 with “DB-SQL” but working on “Basic-Troubleshoot”); quantify % of their workload that is over-qualified.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(Examples of insights the above analyses typically uncover.)

1. Skill scarcity bottlenecks  
  • Network-Firewall tickets wait x = 5.2 h in queue vs. global x = 1.4 h because only 3 agents cover “Networking-Firewall” skill and 2 of them are >90 % utilised at peak.  

2. Excessive reassignments / escalations  
  • 28 % of P3 tickets have 2 reassignments; each extra reassignment adds a mean 2.1 h to resolution time and raises SLA-breach probability by 17 %.  

3. Incorrect first assignment  
  • “Skill-match precision” at L1 dispatching is 62 % (should be 90 %); mis-categorized tickets drive 41 % of P2 breaches.  

4. Uneven workload  
  • Coefficient of variation for open-ticket count across L1 agents is 0.44 during business hours—some agents hit 15 concurrent tickets while others sit at 4.  

5. Overqualified work  
  • L2/L3 specialists spend 23 % of their recorded effort on tickets whose Required Skill  their top-3 competencies (mostly “Basic-Troubleshoot” tasks).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Faulty assignment rules  
  • Round-robin allocator ignores skill and instantaneous queue length  wrong first match and uneven load.  
B. Skill-catalogue quality  
  • Agent profiles not refreshed; 17 % of agents handle skills not listed in HR system (found via role discovery).  
C. Ticket enrichment issues  
  • Channel analysis shows Web-Portal tickets missing Category/Required-Skill 37 % of the time; these cases have 2× escalation rate.  
D. Visibility / real-time data  
  • Dispatchers act without dashboard of live utilisation; rely on static rosters made at shift start.  
E. L1 empowerment  
  • Variant analysis: cases closed by empowered L1s (can reset passwords, reroute e-mail queues, basic DB restart) average 0.8 h resolution vs. 3.4 h when escalated.  

Decision mining (e.g., Guard/Decision Rule discovery) applied to the “Escalate L2” activity can reveal which ticket attributes or agent states actually drive escalations—often exposing non-documented rules such as “if phone call and customer is VIP, escalate immediately”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy 1Skill-Based + Proficiency-Weighted Routing  
Issue addressed: wrong first assignment, overqualified specialists.  
How it works: dispatcher (manual or algorithmic) selects agents whose skill vector best matches Required-Skill (primary) and ticket Category (secondary). A proficiency score (1–5) weights the match; higherproficiency agents are picked only when lower-level agents are unavailable or SLA risk is high.  
Data needed: clean agent-skill-proficiency catalogue; Required-Skill attribute (augmented via NLP on ticket descriptions where missing); real-time agent availability.  
Expected benefits:  
  •  skill-match precision from 62 %  >90 %  
  •  reassignments by 40 %  
  • Release 20 % of L2/L3 capacity for genuinely complex work.

Strategy 2Workload-Aware, Queue-Balancing Assignment  
Issue addressed: uneven load & SLA breaches during peaks.  
How it works: compute each agent’s “effective load” = open tickets×avg remaining effort + active handling time. New tickets are routed to the least-loaded qualified agent (within an SLA-weighted threshold to avoid overloading slower performers).  
Data needed: event-log driven service-time prediction per ticket type; live ticket counts; agent schedules.  
Expected benefits:  
  • Lower coefficient of variation in active workload (<0.2).  
  • Average wait time before “Work Start” reduced by >30 %.  
  • P2/P3 SLA compliance +8–12 pp.

Strategy 3Predictive Assignment & Smart Escalation  
Issue addressed: unnecessary escalations and long L1 handling times.  
How it works: a machine-learning classifier (e.g., gradient-boosted trees) is trained on historical tickets to predict:  
  a) probability of L1 resolution within SLA,  
  b) most probable resolution tier.  
If P(resolved by L1) < 30 %, ticket is auto-routed to L2 at creation; if 30–70 %, L1 gets it but a “fast-track” timer triggers early escalation if no progress within tpred.  
Data needed: full ticket history incl. text, category, customer, channel, past resolution outcome; agent performance stats.  
Expected benefits:  
  • Cut “ping-pong” escalations by half.  
  • Saves 0.9 h mean resolution time on complex P2 tickets.  
  • Improves customer satisfaction scores (fewer handovers).

(Optional Strategy 4Dynamic Tier Blending)  
Cross-train selected L1 agents with in-demand specialist skills; process mining identifies tickets frequently escalated that actually need only a limited set of L2 actions (e.g., firewall rule resets). These agents operate in a blended “L1.5” role during peak periods.

5. Simulation, Implementation & Monitoring  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A. What-If Simulation  
1. Create a discrete-event simulation model from mined BPMN (activities, routing probabilities, rework loops).  
2. Add resource pools with calendars, skills and handling-time distributions mined per agent×activity.  
3. Implement alternative assignment rules in the simulation engine (e.g., BIMP-Analyzer, Celonis EMS Simulator).  
4. Run multiple replications with historical arrival patterns; compare KPIs: mean resolution, queue times, SLA hit ratio, agent utilisation.  
5. Perform sensitivity analysis (e.g., P1 surge, staffing shortage) to choose robust strategy.

B. Implementation Roadmap  
1. Clean & enrich agent-skill catalogue; update every quarter.  
2. Configure ITSM tool (ServiceNow, Jira Service Management…) to support skill & workload-aware routing plugins/APIs.  
3. Pilot on one Category (e.g., Network) for 4 weeks; measure baselines.

C. Continuous Monitoring via Process-Mining Dashboards  
• Real-time SLA Heat-map by Tier & Skill.  
• Queue length and median wait-time per skill group.  
• Assignment Accuracy (%) = correct first-skill match.  
• Reassignment Rate & mean # handovers (overall & per agent).  
• Utilisation & idle-time histograms by agent and tier.  
• Skill Utilisation Matrix (tickets-vs-skills) updated daily.  
Automatic alerts: trigger when utilisation >95 % for scarce skills or when reassignment rate exceeds control limits.

By combining the discovery power of process mining, rigorous root-cause analytics, and simulation-backed redesign, TechSolve can replace ad-hoc, round-robin dispatching with data-driven, skill- and workload-sensitive assignment rules—improving SLA compliance, agent satisfaction, and ultimately customer experience.
