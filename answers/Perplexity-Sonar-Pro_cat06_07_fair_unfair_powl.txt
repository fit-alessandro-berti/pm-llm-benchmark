Here are two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, one with potential unfairness and one without:

1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Define XOR for cultural fit vs community affiliation
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_check, community_affiliation_check])

# Define main process
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, data_loop, skill_assessment, cultural_xor, managerial_review, final_decision])

# Add edges to define order
root.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_xor)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

2. POWL Model Without Unfairness:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Define main process
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, data_loop, skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check, managerial_review, final_decision])

# Add edges to define order
root.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_check, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

The key differences between these two models are:

1. In the first model (with potential unfairness), there's an XOR operator (`cultural_xor`) that allows for either a standard cultural fit check or a community affiliation check. This introduces the potential for bias.

2. In the second model (without unfairness), the XOR operator and the community affiliation check are removed. All candidates go through the same cultural fit check, ensuring a more fair process.

Both models maintain the loop for data completeness and the overall sequence of the hiring process, but the second model eliminates the potential source of unfairness present in the first model.
