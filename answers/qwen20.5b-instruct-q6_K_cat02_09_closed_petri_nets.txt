Sure! Here are some alternative ways to think about the concepts that I provided in my previous answer:

  * Target Position: In contrast to a source place, where something is initially present, target position refers to the location or state of an event or process.
  * Immediate Transition: Just as a source place allows for immediate access and movement, target position provides a point of reference from which events can be observed and controlled in response to external factors.
  * Live Transition: Aspects of an object's behavior change over time, leading to the emergence of new behaviors or states. In contrast, a target position does not necessarily require any observable state at a particular time for transitions to occur.
  * Bounded Net: A bounded net represents a system with a specified number of states (or nodes) that can only be visited and manipulated by the agent performing the transition.
  * Free Choice Net: Similarly to a bounded net, a free choice net allows agents to make choices based on their own preferences or actions. However, unlike in a bounded net, these choices are not necessarily constrained by the system's rules of behavior.

I hope that these alternative concepts provide a more comprehensive perspective on what is meant by different types of systems and processes in Petri nets.
