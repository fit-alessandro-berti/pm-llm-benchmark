### Process Mining Event Log Transformation

#### Logic for Grouping Events into Cases

To create meaningful cases, events are grouped based on **application usage context** and **document-specific activity sequences**. A case represents a logical work session in which a user interacts with a specific application or document. For example:

- **Microsoft Word Work Sessions**: Activities such as typing, saving, and switching focus within the same document are grouped under one case.
- **Email Handling in Gmail**: Events related to opening, replying, and sending emails in Gmail are treated as a separate case.
- **PDF Review**: Activities on a specific PDF in Adobe Acrobat are grouped under one case.
- **Budget Work in Excel**: Excel sessions focused on updating or saving a specific file are treated as a single case.

#### Logic for Activity Naming

Raw action names are generalized to higher-level, standardized activity names:

- "FOCUS"  "Switch to [Application/Document]"
- "TYPING"  "Edit [Application/Document]" or "Draft in [Application/Document]"
- "SAVE"  "Save [Application/Document]"
- "CLICK"  Generalized action such as "Open Email" or "Reply to Email"
- "SCROLL"  "Scroll through [Application/Document]"
- "HIGHLIGHT"  "Highlight text in [Application/Document]"

The narrative aims to provide a coherent sequence of user actions focused on the purpose of each work session.

### Summary of Logic

1. **Case Identification**: Events were grouped based on the application/document in focus and the sequence of actions. Work sessions were distinct if there was a switch to a different application or file.
2. **Activity Naming**: Low-level actions were generalized to make the log more interpretable for process analysis. For example, "FOCUS" and "TYPING" were combined into activities like "Draft in [Document]" or "Edit [Document]."
3. **Temporal Structure**: Events are structured to reflect the flow of user actions over time, ensuring logical storytelling for process analysis.

This transformed event log is suitable for analysis with standard process mining tools to understand workflows, identify bottlenecks, and optimize user efficiency.
