# Procure-to-Pay Anomaly Analysis

## Executive Summary
All four cases contain significant anomalies that deviate from standard P2P process controls and best practices. These anomalies represent control weaknesses, compliance risks, and potential fraud indicators.

## Detailed Anomaly Analysis

### **CASE 1001: Compliant (Baseline)**
 **No anomalies detected**

This case follows the standard P2P sequence:
1. Create  Approve  Issue PO  Receive Goods  Invoice  Match  Pay  Close

---

### **CASE 1002: Critical Anomalies**

#### **Anomaly 1: Approval AFTER PO Issuance**
- **Sequence:** Create Requisition (08:30)  Issue PO (08:40)  **Approve Requisition (02-03 08:00)**
- **Problem:** The requisition was approved **3 days after** the purchase order was already issued. This violates fundamental authorization controls.
- **Risk:** 
  - Unauthorized procurement occurring without proper approval
  - Potential fraud or policy violation
  - No financial authority check before commitment

#### **Anomaly 2: Payment BEFORE Goods Receipt and Invoice Matching**
- **Sequence:** Invoice Received (02-03 07:15)  **Release Payment (02-03 07:15)**  Receive Goods (02-04 09:00)  Match Invoice (02-05 08:00)
- **Problem:** Payment released simultaneously with invoice receipt, before goods were received or invoice was matched to the PO.
- **Risk:**
  - Three-way match control completely bypassed (PO  Invoice  Receipt)
  - Payment made for goods never verified as received
  - High exposure to invoice fraud or duplicate payments
  - No quality assurance on goods before payment commitment

#### **Anomaly 3: Out-of-Sequence Activity**
- Goods received **after** payment released (Feb 2-04 vs Feb 2-03)
- This is a critical control break: paying before verifying goods receipt

---

### **CASE 1003: Critical Anomalies**

#### **Anomaly 1: Severe Sequencing Violation – Payment BEFORE Receipt and Invoice**
- **Sequence:** Issue PO (02-02)  **Release Payment (02-08)**  Vendor Invoice (02-09)  Receive Goods (02-10)
- **Problem:** Payment released 6 days before invoice received and 8 days before goods received.
- **Risk:**
  - Extreme control breakdown: paying without any supporting documentation
  - Potential payment to fraudulent vendors
  - No verification that goods will ever be received
  - Possible duplicate payments if invoice arrives later
  - Cash flow management failure

#### **Anomaly 2: Invoice Receipt AFTER Payment**
- Payment (02-08)  Invoice (02-09)  Goods (02-10)
- **Problem:** This reverses the standard flow entirely
- **Risk:**
  - Payment without documented invoice reference
  - Reconciliation nightmare
  - Audit trail is compromised

#### **Anomaly 3: Goods Receipt as LAST step before matching**
- Receive Goods (02-10)  Match Invoice to PO (02-11)
- **Problem:** 3-way match should occur before payment, not after
- **Risk:**
  - Defective goods acceptance without recourse options
  - Return/rejection becomes complicated after payment

---

### **CASE 1004: Critical Anomalies**

#### **Anomaly 1: PO Issued AFTER Goods Received**
- **Sequence:** Approve Requisition (02-05 10:15)  **Receive Goods (02-06 09:00)**  **Issue PO (02-06 09:15)**
- **Problem:** Goods received before purchase order was formally issued
- **Risk:**
  - Unplanned procurement; goods received on faith/verbal agreement
  - No formal terms and conditions established before receipt
  - Vendor could claim different pricing/terms than expected
  - Receipt documentation has no corresponding PO to validate against
  - Potential unauthorized or off-contract purchases

#### **Anomaly 2: Goods Received Without PO (Implicit)**
- Since PO issued after receipt, the receiving department accepted goods without formal purchase authorization
- **Risk:**
  - Quality/quantity acceptance without contractual baseline
  - No specification reference for verification
  - Possible acceptance of wrong items

## Summary Table of Anomalies

| Case | Critical Issues | Severity | Root Control Broken |
|------|-----------------|----------|---------------------|
| 1001 | None |  Compliant | N/A |
| 1002 | Late approval; Early payment (no 3-way match) | **HIGH** | Authorization & 3-way match |
| 1003 | Payment before invoice & goods; Extreme sequencing | **CRITICAL** | All core controls |
| 1004 | PO issued after goods receipt | **HIGH** | Procurement authorization |

---

## Standard P2P Best Practices Violated

| Control | Violated In | Requirement |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Approval before commitment** | 1002 | Requisition must be approved BEFORE PO issuance |
| **3-Way Match** | 1002, 1003 | PO  Invoice  Receipt must all exist before payment |
| **Payment after receipt** | 1002, 1003 | Goods/services must be received BEFORE payment |
| **Payment after matching** | 1003 | 3-way match must complete BEFORE payment release |
| **PO before receipt** | 1004 | PO must be issued BEFORE goods acceptance |

## Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **Case 1002:** Investigate the payment; verify goods actually received and match quality/quantity to invoice
2. **Case 1003:** **URGENT** - Trace payment; confirm goods eventually delivered; audit vendor; check for duplicate invoices
3. **Case 1004:** Verify goods specifications against late PO issuance; assess if vendor can still modify terms
4. **System-wide:** Implement workflow constraints preventing:
   - PO issuance without prior approval
   - Payment without completed 3-way match
   - Payment before goods receipt
