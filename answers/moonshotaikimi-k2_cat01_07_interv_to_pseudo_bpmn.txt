BPMN-like Textual Process Model  
Invoice Approval (Accounts-Payable domain)

1. START  
   Trigger: Supplier e-mailsinvoice to AP-Shared Mailbox.

2. Task T0 – “Initial Invoice Receipt”  
   Performer: Accounts Payable Clerk (AP-Clerk)  
   – Open e-mail and attachments.  
   – Inspect whether the invoice bears a valid PO-number.

3. Exclusive Gateway G1 – PO-number present?  
   • Path 1a – PO absent  
     – Task T1 – “Request PO Clarification”  
       Performer: AP-Clerk  
       Action: Reply to supplier asking for PO or re-issued invoice (loop-back to START).  
   • Path 1b – PO present  
     – Task T2 – “Log Invoice in ERP*”  
       Performer: AP-Clerk  
       Artifact Output: Invoice record in state “Await PO-Receipt Confirmation”.

4. Task T3 – “Forward to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation”  
   Performer: AP-Clerk  
   Channel: ERP* auto-email + internal task in system queue  
   Roles involved: Purchasing Officer.

5. Task T4 – “Verify Receipt / Match to PO”  
   Performer: Purchasing Officer  
   Data: Invoice record + PO  
   Actions  
   – Open linked PO.  
   – Compare quantities, unit prices, delivery charges, special notes.  
   Decision: mark in ERP as “Receipt confirmed” OR “Fees discrepant”.

6. Exclusive Gateway G2 – Receipt & prices correct?  
   • Path 2a – Discrepancy detected  
     – Task T5 – “Resolve Discrepancy”  
       Loosely ordered sub-conversation  
       5-a Supplier contacted by Purchasing OR Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM).  
       5-b Supplier issues credit note or replacement invoice  returns to START.  
       5-c If still unresolved AND AP-Clerk cannot proceed  escalate (see Exception Sub-Process).  
   • Path 2b – All correct  
     – Task T6 – “Send Confirmation to AP”  
       Action: Purchasing Officer marks “Receipt & Price OK” in ERP; automatic e-mail to AP-Clerk triggers next task.

7. Task T7 – “Final PO/Invoice Line-level Match”  
   Performer: AP-Clerk  
   Inputs: Invoice record + PO  
   Decision: exact match OR residual mismatch (e.g., rounding, freight).

8. Exclusive Gateway G3 – Mismatch remains?  
   • Path 3a – Mismatch:  
        Escalate immediately to Exception Sub-Process.  
   • Path 3b – Match or mismatch cleared:  
        Proceed to Approval.

9. Task T8 – “Submit for Manager Approval”  
   Performer: System auto-task (AP Clerk triggered it via prior step).  
   Artifact: Approval link sent as e-mail / portal notification.

10. Task T9 – “Manager Review & Approve/Reject”  
    Performer: Department Manager  
    Portal view: Invoice PDF, PO extract, receipt confirmation note.  
    Gateways:  
    – G4 Approve?  
      • Approve  Invoice state “Approved for Payment”.  
      • Reject  task T10 “Hold Invoice” + manual query to AP-Clerk  loop back to earlier step.

11. Task T11 – “Schedule Payment Run”  
    Performer: AP-Clerk (regular weekly cycle)  
    Inputs: “Approved” invoices  
    Output: Payments file transmitted to treasury / bank.

12. END – Invoice process instance closed.

Exception Sub-Process (Escalation) – label “Handle Exception”  
Entry triggers:  
- Step 5 if Purchasing cannot resolve discrepancy.  
- Step 7 if AP-Clerk cannot resolve line-level mismatch.  
- Separate start: invoice received with no PO (informal contract) if supplier insists.

Performed by: Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)  
Main steps:  
   a. Contact supplier & relevant departments.  
   b. Create retrospective PO (if allowed) OR reject invoice.  
   c. Return cleaned invoice to normal flow at point of failure (step 1 or step 4 depending on resolution).

Parallel/background lane: Supplier Relationship Manager  
Shadow participates in steps T5, Exception Sub-Process to expedite external clarifications.

Data-objects explicitly mentioned  
Invoice PDF, PO PDF, ERP invoice record, credit notes, corrective invoices, confirmation e-mails.

Unresolved / noted ambiguities  
- “Renegotiating pricing after PO issued” is not explicitly modeled; assumed handled as Exception.  
- Payment scheduling cadence (weekly vs ad-hoc) is out of scope; end event only marks “Scheduled”.
