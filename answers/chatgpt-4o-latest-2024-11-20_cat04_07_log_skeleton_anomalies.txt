Here are some anomalies in the proposed **Log Skeleton process model**, based on the declarative constraints provided:

### 1. **Conflicting Constraints**
There seem to be contradictions between constraints of different categories. For example:

#### a) "Never Together" vs. "Equivalence"
- Equivalence constraints imply that two activities will always co-exist in the same case and will occur the same number of times. However, "Never Together" specifies that some of these activities cannot co-exist.
  - **Conflict Example:** 
    - Equivalence: `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')` forces these two to co-exist.
    - Never Together: `('Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')` implies these two cannot co-exist in a case—but the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" frequently appears linked in equivalence and other dependencies.

This creates conflicting expectations about which activities can co-exist within the process.

#### b) "Always Before" vs. "Never Together"
- If an "Always Before" constraint exists between two activities, they must both exist in a trace to enforce the temporal ordering. However, "Never Together" prevents their co-existence.
  - **Conflict Example:** 
    - Always Before: `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')`—this mandates that if the first activity occurs, the second must precede it.
    - Never Together: `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE')` indirectly conflicts because "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" and downward paths for case evolutions often eventually tie into employee "SAVED" items—it effectively blocks the potential use weak paths based of dependency focuslog-related pullingATURE
