### Identifying Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors

1. **Out-of-Order Activities**:
   - Based on the normal process flow, activities in some cases do not follow the prescribed sequence.
     - **Case ID 1002**: 
       - "Confirm Shipment" occurs before "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock". 
       - This could indicate potential pre-authorization without adequate validation.
     - **Case ID 1003**:
       - "Ship Goods" occurs before "Confirm Shipment", which contradicts the normal process flow.
   - **Case ID 1004**:
       - "Receive Payment" occurs before "Issue Invoice". Typically, payment follows the generation of an invoice.

2. **Activity Skipping**:
   - Some cases show missing activities from the normal process flow:
     - **Case ID 1002**:
       - Missing "Receive Payment".
     - **Case ID 1004**:
       - Missing "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock".
   - Failing to perform complete steps might lead to errors like shipping goods without proper stock validation or fulfilling orders without checking payment.

3. **Delayed or Accelerated Steps**:
   - **Case ID 1004**: 
     - "Ship Goods" is performed exceptionally quickly—within 25 minutes of the order registration. This could violate existing service-level agreements, policies, or be considered suspicious.
   - **Case ID 1001**:
     - There is a 5-day delay between "Issue Invoice" and "Receive Payment". Unusually long delays might indicate payment collection inefficiency.

4. **Resource Utilization Anomalies**:
   - Resource roles may be used inappropriately:
     - **Case ID 1004**:
       - A "Cashier" captured payment without a prior invoice being issued. This could point to compliance issues.
   - **Case ID 1002**:
     - "Confirm Shipment" is performed by LogisticsMgr_2 before any stock validation or credit checks by Finance. This might indicate procedural bypasses or a possible training issue with the resource.

### Potential Hypotheses for Anomalies

#### Hypothesis 1: Procedural Bypasses by Logistics Department
   - Anomalies where "Confirm Shipment" or "Ship Goods" occur earlier than expected might suggest either a lack of safeguards in the system enforcing procedural steps or deliberate bypasses by staff for expediency.

#### Hypothesis 2: System Timing/Fragmentation Issues
   - Out-of-order events (e.g., where "Confirm Shipment" occurs before validation steps) may indicate issues with asynchronous event logging or system lag between departments, corrupting the process flow.

#### Hypothesis 3: Departmental Misalignment or Training Gaps
   - Cases where resources inappropriately perform activities (e.g., "Cashier" capturing payment before invoice issuance) likely highlight a lack of role-specific accountability or training issues.

#### Hypothesis 4: Priority Orders Overriding Process
   - Priority orders (e.g., **Case ID 1002**) might intentionally or unintentionally bypass normal steps to expedite shipping. This could be either policy-driven or a misclassification of an order's urgency.

#### Hypothesis 5: Resource Workload or Mismanagement
   - Delayed payments or skipped steps might be caused by overwhelmed or poorly allocated resources across departments (e.g., underutilization or overloading of finance team roles like "Cashier").

### Proposed SQL Queries

#### 1. **Identify Out-of-Order Activities Across All Cases**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       case_id, 
       event_id, 
       activity, 
       timestamp 
   FROM 
       order_event_log 
   WHERE 
       case_id IN (
           SELECT case_id 
           FROM (
               SELECT 
                   case_id, 
                   STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence 
               FROM 
                   order_event_log
               GROUP BY 
                   case_id
           ) AS sequences
           WHERE 
               activity_sequence NOT LIKE '%Register Order -> Perform Credit Check -> Validate Stock -> Confirm Shipment -> Ship Goods -> Issue Invoice -> Receive Payment%'
       )
   ORDER BY 
       case_id, timestamp;
   ```
   **Purpose**: Identifies all cases where activities occurred out of the prescribed order.

---

#### 2. **List Cases Missing Key Activities**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       o.case_id, 
       STRING_AGG(e.activity, ', ' ORDER BY e.timestamp) AS completed_activities
   FROM 
       orders o
   LEFT JOIN 
       order_event_log e
   ON 
       o.case_id = e.case_id
   GROUP BY 
       o.case_id
   HAVING 
       NOT (
           STRING_AGG(e.activity, ', ' ORDER BY e.timestamp) LIKE '%Register Order%' AND
           STRING_AGG(e.activity, ', ' ORDER BY e.timestamp) LIKE '%Perform Credit Check%' AND
           STRING_AGG(e.activity, ', ' ORDER BY e.timestamp) LIKE '%Validate Stock%' AND
           STRING_AGG(e.activity, ', ' ORDER BY e.timestamp) LIKE '%Confirm Shipment%' AND
           STRING_AGG(e.activity, ', ' ORDER BY e.timestamp) LIKE '%Ship Goods%' AND
           STRING_AGG(e.activity, ', ' ORDER BY e.timestamp) LIKE '%Issue Invoice%' AND
           STRING_AGG(e.activity, ', ' ORDER BY e.timestamp) LIKE '%Receive Payment%'
       );
   ```
   **Purpose**: Detects orders that are missing one or more required process activities.

---

#### 3. **Focus on Early Shipment Events**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       o.case_id, 
       o.order_type, 
       o.order_value, 
       e1.timestamp AS ship_time, 
       e2.timestamp AS register_time, 
       (e1.timestamp - e2.timestamp) AS time_diff
   FROM 
       order_event_log e1
   JOIN 
       order_event_log e2
   ON 
       e1.case_id = e2.case_id
   JOIN 
       orders o
   ON 
       e1.case_id = o.case_id
   WHERE 
       e1.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND 
       e2.activity = 'Register Order'
   ORDER BY 
       time_diff ASC;
   ```
   **Purpose**: Highlights cases where "Ship Goods" occurs suspiciously soon after "Register Order".

---

#### 4. **Investigate Resource Misassignments**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       e.case_id, 
       e.event_id, 
       e.activity, 
       e.resource, 
       r.role, 
       r.department
   FROM 
       order_event_log e
   LEFT JOIN 
       resources r
   ON 
       e.resource = r.resource_id
   WHERE 
       (e.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND r.role NOT LIKE '%Cashier%')
       OR
       (e.activity = 'Validate Stock' AND r.department NOT LIKE '%Logistics%');
   ```
   **Purpose**: Identifies cases where activities were performed by resources with inappropriate roles/departments.

---

#### 5. **Analyze Delayed Activities (e.g., Late Payments)**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       e1.case_id, 
       e1.activity AS issue_invoice, 
       e1.timestamp AS invoice_time, 
       e2.activity AS receive_payment, 
       e2.timestamp AS payment_time, 
       (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp) AS delay
   FROM 
       order_event_log e1
   JOIN 
       order_event_log e2
   ON 
       e1.case_id = e2.case_id
   WHERE 
       e1.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND 
       e2.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND 
       e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
   ORDER BY 
       delay DESC;
   ```
   **Purpose**: Captures cases where payment delays significantly deviate from typical timeframes.

---

#### 6. **Check for Priority Orders with Skipped Validation Steps**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       o.case_id, 
       o.order_type, 
       o.order_value, 
       a.completed_activities
   FROM 
       orders o
   LEFT JOIN (
       SELECT 
           case_id, 
           STRING_AGG(activity, ', ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS completed_activities
       FROM 
           order_event_log
       GROUP BY 
           case_id
   ) AS a
   ON 
       o.case_id = a.case_id
   WHERE 
       o.order_type = 'priority' AND 
       (
           completed_activities NOT LIKE '%Perform Credit Check%' OR
           completed_activities NOT LIKE '%Validate Stock%'
       );
   ```
   **Purpose**: Focuses on priority orders missing essential validation steps.
