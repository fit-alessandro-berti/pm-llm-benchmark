Sure! Here is an example of a POWL model for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator
# Define the transition and silent transitions for the process
A = Transition(label="Request for Purchase Order")
B = Transition(label="Approve Purchase Order")
C = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
D = Transition(label="Send Purchase Order to Supplier")
E = Transition(label="Receive Purchase Order")
F = SilentTransition()
# Define the loop node for the approval process
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, F])
# Define the XOR node for the supplier response
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D, E])
# Define the main process as a strict partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])
# Define the order between the nodes
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
# Define the order between the loop and the XOR node
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
# Define the order between the XOR node and D and E
root.order.add_edge(xor, D)
root.order.add_edge(xor, E)
```

This code defines a Purchase-to-Pay process where a request for a purchase order is made, then either approved or denied, and either a purchase order is created or the process is finished. The process also includes a loop for the approval process and a XOR node for the supplier response. The order between the nodes is defined using the `add_edge` method of the `StrictPartialOrder` class.
