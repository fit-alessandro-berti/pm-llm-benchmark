Based on the provided data, some of the attributes that can be considered sensitive for fairness include:

* "hand in job application" - The activity "Hand In Job Application" may trigger a check based on certain characteristics, such as location or age. This could lead to biases against candidates who do not fit those profiles.
* "gender" - This attribute might have an impact depending on the context. It is sensitive for gender equality and can lead to unintended consequences if used improperly.

* "german speaking" - It could influence decisions based on language proficiency, which is related to cultural and linguistic diversity.

* "religious" - Similar to gender sensitivity, this attribute also has implications regarding respect for religious beliefs.

* "resource type" - The resource type (e.g., HR-dummy, Senior Partner) indicates whether the applicant will have an easier or a harder time getting through a process. This can affect job opportunities and fairness based on resources.

These attributes are sensitive due to their potential impact on various aspects of an individual's life and ability, especially if they discriminate against particular demographics or groups.
