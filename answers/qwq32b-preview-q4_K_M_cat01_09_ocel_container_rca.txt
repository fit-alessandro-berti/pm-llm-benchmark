To identify the root causes of performance issues in this object-centric event log, we need to analyze the directly follows graphs for each object type and look for patterns or anomalies that could indicate bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or other problems. Here's a step-by-step analysis based on the provided data:

### 1. Handling Unit

- **"Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck"**: High frequency (10553 events), which seems normal.
- **Duration**: 7820.93 units.

This suggests that the time taken to collect goods and load them onto trucks is significant but might be acceptable depending on the context.

### 2. Truck

- **"Load Truck" -> "Load Truck"**: Frequency (8559 events), duration (5259.71).
- **"Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal"**: Frequency (1989 events), duration (10999.07).
- **"Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck"**: Frequency (1988 events), duration (84119.09).

**Potential Issue:**

- The duration for "Drive to Terminal" to "Load Truck" is extremely high (84119.09). This could indicate that trucks are taking a long time to return or prepare for the next load, which might be a bottleneck.

### 3. Container

This object type has multiple transitions with varying frequencies and durations. Some notable ones:

- **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container"**: Frequency (1995 events), duration (368943.92). This is a very high duration, suggesting that ordering and picking up empty containers takes a significant amount of time.
  
  - **Potential Issue:** The process of ordering and picking up empty containers is time-consuming and may be causing delays in the overall process.

- **"Pick Up Empty Container" -> "Load Truck"**: Frequency (1994 events), duration (38659.62). Still high but less than the previous transition.
  
  - **Potential Issue:** The time between picking up containers and loading them onto trucks is also, which could be contributing to overall process delays.

- **"Weigh" -> "Place in Stock"**: Frequency (1814 events), duration (1960.09).
- **"Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay"**: Frequency (1794 events), duration (743380.51). This is another very high duration.
  
  - **Potential Issue:** The time taken to bring containers from stock to the loading bay is excessively long, which could be a major bottleneck.

- **"Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle"**: Frequency (1931 events), duration (2428.91).
- **"Load to Vehicle" -> "Depart"**: Frequency (1956 events), duration (89846.62). Again, a high duration.
  
  - **Potential Issue:** The time from loading containers onto vehicles to departing is substantial, indicating possible delays in vehicle readiness or other preparatory steps.

### 4. Vehicle

- **"Load to Vehicle" -> "Load to Vehicle"**: Frequency (1827 events), duration (1960.59).
- **"Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles"**: Frequency (585 events), duration (295965.56). Very high duration.
  
  - **Potential Issue:** The process of booking vehicles is taking an unusually long time, which could be a bottleneck.

- **"Load to Vehicle" -> "Depart"**: Frequency (127 events), duration (72985.89).
- **"Book Vehicles" -> "Load to Vehicle"**: Frequency (122 events), duration (283101.01). Another high duration.
  
  - **Potential Issue:** The transition from booking vehicles to loading them is time-consuming, indicating potential inefficiencies in vehicle allocation or preparation.

- **"Book Vehicles" -> "Reschedule Container"**: Frequency (19 events), duration (371476.42).
- **"Reschedule Container" -> "Reschedule Container"**: Frequency (16 events), duration (40895.81).
- **"Reschedule Container" -> "Book Vehicles"**: Frequency (12 events), duration (22237.92).
- **"Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle"**: Frequency (7 events), duration (152433.14).
- **"Load to Vehicle" -> "Book Vehicles"**: Frequency (2 events), duration (5679.00).

**Potential Issues:**

- Rescheduling containers seems to be involving multiple transitions with high durations, suggesting that rescheduling is a time-consuming process and may be indicative of underlying issues in container management or vehicle availability.

### 5. Forklift

- Multiple transitions with frequencies in the thousands but relatively low durations compared to other object types.
  
  - **Potential Issue:** While forklift activities seem efficient in terms of duration, their high frequency might indicate overutilization or potential bottlenecks if forklifts are a limited resource.

### 6. Customer Order

- **"Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document"**: Frequency (594 events), duration (329005.22).
  
  - **Potential Issue:** The time between registering a customer order and creating a transport document is very high, which could be leading to delays in fulfilling orders.

### 7. Transport Document

- **"Create Transport Document" -> "Book Vehicles"**: Frequency (594 events), duration (22207.07).
- **"Book Vehicles" -> "Order Empty Containers"**: Frequency (593 events), duration (43935.45).
- **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart"**: Frequency (561 events), duration (1007066.16). This is an extremely high duration.
  
  - **Potential Issue:** The time from ordering empty containers to departing is extraordinarily long, suggesting significant delays in this part of the process.

- **"Depart" -> "Depart"**: Frequency (142 events), duration (1051301.41).
- **"Reschedule Container" -> "Depart"**: Frequency (33 events), duration (275189.97).
- **"Depart" -> "Reschedule Container"**: Frequency (21 events), duration (255614.86).
- **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Reschedule Container"**: Frequency (13 events), duration (298469.31).
- **"Reschedule Container" -> "Reschedule Container"**: Frequency (2 events), duration (8635.50).

**Potential Issues:**

- The high durations in transitions involving "Depart" and "Reschedule Container" suggest that there are prolonged periods where vehicles are not moving or containers are being rescheduled, leading to inefficiencies.

### Summary of Root Causes

1. **Long Durations in Ordering and Picking Up Empty Containers:**
   - The process from ordering empty containers to picking them up is taking an excessively long time.
   
2. **Inefficient Stock Management:**
   - High durations in bringing containers from stock to the loading bay indicate potential issues with stock location, organization, or transportation methods.

3. **Vehicle Booking and Preparation Delays:**
   - The process of booking vehicles and preparing them for loading is time-consuming, leading to delays in the overall process.

4. **Rescheduling Activities:**
   - Frequent rescheduling of containers and vehicles indicates underlying issues with planning or resource availability, leading to inefficiencies and increased processing times.

5. **Initial Order Processing:**
   - The time between registering a customer order and creating a transport document is too long, potentially causing delays in fulfilling customer requests.

To address these issues, the following actions could be considered:

- Optimize the process of ordering and picking up empty containers to reduce waiting times.
- Improve stock management practices to make container retrieval more efficient.
- Streamline vehicle booking and preparation processes to minimize delays.
- Review and optimize rescheduling procedures to reduce the need for rescheduling and decrease associated processing times.
- Expedite the initial order processing steps to ensure quicker response times to customer orders.

By focusing on these areas, the overall performance and efficiency of the process can be significantly improved.
