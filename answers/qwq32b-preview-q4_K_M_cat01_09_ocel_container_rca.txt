So I've been given this big directly follows graph from an object-centric event log, and I need to find out what's causing performance issues in the process. There are a lot of different object types and transitions between activities, each with frequencies in terms of events and objects, and durations. It's a bit overwhelming at first, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a directly follows graph is. In process mining, a directly follows graph shows sequences of activities that directly follow one another in the event log. Each edge in the graph represents a transition from one activity to another, and the frequency indicates how many times this sequence occurs.

Given that it's object-centric, different object types have their own flows, which means the process likely involves multiple interconnected subprocesses, each centered around a particular type of object.

My goal is to identify root causes for performance issues. Performance issues could manifest as bottlenecks, where certain activities take too long or have too much work piled up, or as cycles or loops that don't contribute value and just extend the process time.

So, I should look for activities with high frequencies, long durations, or cycles that might be causing delays.

Let's start by looking at each object type one by one.

First, Handling Unit:

- "Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck" with a frequency of 10553 events and objects, duration 7820.93.

This seems like a straightforward transition, and the duration is relatively low compared to some others I'll see later.

Next, Truck:

- "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" with 8559 events, 6 objects, duration 5259.71.

Wait, "Load Truck" following itself? That suggests that trucks are being loaded multiple times, possibly without any other activities in between. The frequency is high, but the number of objects is only 6, meaning there are 6 trucks being loaded multiple times.

- "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal" with 1989 events, 6 objects, duration 10999.07.

So after loading, trucks drive to the terminal.

- "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck" with 1988 events, 6 objects, duration 84119.09.

Interesting, after driving to the terminal, they load trucks again. This could indicate a cycle where trucks keep going back for more loading, which might not be efficient.

Looking at these transitions for Trucks, it seems like there's a cycle: Load Truck -> Drive to Terminal -> Load Truck, repeating multiple times for the same trucks. This could be a root cause of performance issues if trucks are making unnecessary trips.

Maybe there should be a point where trucks stop loading and proceed to another stage without returning to load again.

Next, Container:

This has a lot of transitions, so I'll need to go through them carefully.

- "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" with 8559 events, 1896 objects, duration 5259.71.

Similar to Trucks, containers are being loaded multiple times onto the same trucks.

- "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" with 1995 events, objects, duration 368943.92.

That's a very long duration for picking up empty containers. Over 368 days seems excessive.

- "Pick Up Empty Container" -> "Load Truck" with 1994 events, objects, duration 38659.62.

Again, a relatively long duration.

- "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal" with 1989 events, objects, duration 10999.07.

Similar to Trucks.

- "Drive to Terminal" -> "Weigh" with 1989 events, objects, duration 2559.54.

- "Load to Vehicle" -> "Depart" with 1956 events, objects, duration 89846.62.

Over 89 days for this transition is significant.

- "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle" with 1931 events, objects, duration 2428.91.

- "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" with 1814 events, objects, duration 1960.09.

- "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" with 1794 events, objects, duration 743380.51.

That's over 8 days, which is very long.

- "Weigh" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" with 175 events, objects, duration 1157.41.

- "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Reschedule Container" with 36 events, objects, duration 7110.06.

- "Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle" with 35 events, objects, duration 177997.60.

Over 177 days for rescheduling and then loading to vehicle seems too long.

Looking at Containers, there are several transitions with very long durations, especially "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" with over 846 days, which is enormous. This suggests that containers are sitting in stock for a very long time before being brought to the loading bay, which is a major performance issue.

Additionally, the cycle involving "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" might be inefficient if not all containers need to go through this loop.

Perhaps some containers could bypass placing in stock and go directly to loading bay to reduce waiting times.

Next, Vehicle:

- "Load to Vehicle" -> "Load to Vehicle" with 1827 events, 127 objects, duration 1960.59.

Vehicles are being loaded multiple times, similar to trucks.

- "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" with 585 events, 124 objects, duration 295965.56.

Over 34 days for booking vehicles repeatedly seems too long.

- "Load to Vehicle" -> "Depart" with 127 events, objects, duration 72985.89.

Over 84 days from loading to departing is significant.

- "Book Vehicles" -> "Load to Vehicle" with 122 events, objects, duration 283101.01.

Over 3 days for booking to loading.

- "Book Vehicles" -> "Reschedule Container" with 19 events, objects, duration 371476.42.

Over 4 days.

- "Reschedule Container" -> "Reschedule Container" with 16 events, objects, duration 40895.81.

Over 4 days.

- "Reschedule Container" -> "Book Vehicles" with 12 events, objects, duration 22237.92.

- "Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle" with 7 events, objects, duration 152433.14.

Over 1.8 days.

- "Load to Vehicle" -> "Book Vehicles" with 2 events, objects, duration 5679.00.

This seems more reasonable.

In the Vehicle object type, there are cycles involving booking vehicles and rescheduling containers, which might be causing delays due to repeated bookings and rescheduling.

Perhaps there's a need to streamline the booking process or reduce the need for rescheduling.

Next, Forklift:

- Several transitions with frequencies in the thousands but only 3 objects, suggesting that forklifts are being used intensively.

- Durations vary from a few hours to over a day.

Given that there are only 3 forklifts handling thousands of events, this could be a bottleneck.

Maybe more forklifts are needed to handle the workload.

Lastly, Customer Order and Transport Document:

- "Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document" with 594 events, objects, duration 329005.22.

Over 3 days, which seems acceptable.

- "Create Transport Document" -> "Book Vehicles" with 594 events, objects, duration 22207.07.

Under 2 days.

- "Book Vehicles" -> "Order Empty Containers" with 593 events, objects, duration 43935.45.

Over 4 days.

- "Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart" with 561 events, objects, duration 1007066.16.

Over 11 days.

- "Depart" -> "Depart" with 142 events, 160 objects, duration 1051301.41.

This self-loop on depart seems odd. Maybe it's a mistake or there's confusion in the logging.

- "Reschedule Container" -> "Depart" with 33 events, objects, duration 275189.97.

Over 3 days.

- "Depart" -> "Reschedule Container" with 21 events, objects, duration 255614.86.

Over 2.9 days.

- "Order Empty Containers" -> "Reschedule Container" with 13 events, objects, duration 298469.31.

Over 3.4 days.

- "Reschedule Container" -> "Reschedule Container" with 2 events, objects, duration 8635.50.

Under a day.

Looking at these transitions, the duration from ordering empty containers to departing is over 11 days, which seems too long.

Additionally, there are cycles between depart and rescheduling containers, which might indicate issues with container availability or scheduling.

Potential root causes:

1. **Long waiting times for containers in stock:** The transition "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" has an extremely long duration of over 846 days. This suggests that containers are stagnating in stock for extended periods, leading to significant delays in the process.

2. **Repeated loading of trucks and vehicles:** The self-loops in "Load Truck" and "Load to Vehicle" indicate multiple loadings without intermediate activities, which might not be necessary and could be optimized to reduce handling times.

3. **Inefficient rescheduling processes:** There are multiple transitions involving rescheduling containers, with long durations, suggesting that the rescheduling process is time-consuming and possibly poorly managed.

4. **Insufficient resources:** With only a few forklifts handling thousands of events, there may be bottlenecks in moving containers and loading vehicles.

5. **Cycles in truck activities:** The cycle "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck" might indicate that trucks are making multiple unnecessary trips, extending the process time.

6. **Long durations in booking vehicles:** The duration for booking vehicles is several days, which could be improved for better efficiency.

To summarize, the key areas to investigate for performance improvements are:

- Optimizing the flow of containers from placement in stock to loading bay to reduce waiting times.

- Reviewing the necessity of multiple loadings for trucks and vehicles to minimize handling steps.

- Streamlining the rescheduling process to reduce delays associated with it.

- Considering increasing the number of forklifts to handle the workload more efficiently.

- Evaluating the truck routing to eliminate unnecessary trips.

- Improving the vehicle booking process to reduce booking times.

Each of these areas could potentially yield significant improvements in process performance by reducing bottlenecks and eliminating non-value-added activities.
