Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group (first) and the 'unprotected' group (second), using domain knowledge related to loan processing:

1. **Process Complexity**:
   - Protected Group: The processes for the protected group are generally more complex with multiple steps involving assessments, co-signers, and repeated visits.
     - Example: Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied (frequency = 37, performance = 369971.649)
   - Unprotected Group: The processes for the unprotected group are simpler and more direct.
     - Example: Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement (frequency = 1656, performance = 340004.889)

2. **Frequency of Denials**:
   - Protected Group: The protected group has a higher frequency of loan denials after multiple assessments and steps.
     - Total denials: 2768 (protected) vs. 1517 (unprotected)
   - Unprotected Group: The unprotected group has more straightforward processes with fewer denials.

3. **Performance Time**:
   - Protected Group: The protected group's processes take longer to complete, indicating more time spent on assessments and reviews.
     - Average performance time: ~340,000 seconds (protected) vs. ~345,000 seconds (unprotected)
   - Unprotected Group: While there are some outliers with longer times in the unprotected group, overall, their processes take less time on average.

4. **Co-Signer Requirement**:
   - Protected Group: Co-signers are requested more frequently for the protected group, indicating stricter lending criteria.
     - Total co-signer requests: 1027 (protected) vs. 539 (unprotected)
   - Unprotected Group: The unprotected group has fewer instances where a co-signer is required.

5. **Skipped Examination**:
   - Protected Group: There are no instances of 'skipped_examination' in the protected group's processes.
   - Unprotected Group: There is one instance of 'skipped_examination' in the unprotected group's processes (frequency = 332, performance = 260013.446), suggesting a different approach to handling applications.

These differences suggest that the protected group faces more stringent lending criteria and longer processing times compared to the unprotected group. This could indicate unfair treatment or discrimination against the protected group in loan processing.
