To construct a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process, we need to define the constraints for each activity. Based on typical order fulfillment processes, we can infer the following constraints:

1. **Equivalence:** There might be no specific pairs of activities that must occur the same number of times together, so we'll keep this set empty.
2. **Always Before:** The check availability (`CA`) should occur before the reserve items (`RI`), pick items (`PI`), and quality check (`QC`).
3. **Always After:** The reserve items (`RI`) should occur after the check availability (`CA`), and the pick items (`PI`) and quality check (`QC`) should occur after the reserve items (`RI`).
4. **Never Together:** Some activities should never occur together, such as `PO` and `GSL` (they are mutually exclusive), and `IC` and `RP` (they are mutually exclusive).
5. **Activity Occurrences:** Each activity might have a specific number of occurrences, but since the exact number isn't provided, we'll use a common range for each activity.
6. **Directly-Follows Constraints:** Certain activities should directly follow others, as specified above.

Here's how the Python dictionary for the Log Skeleton can be structured:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('CA', 'PI'),
        ('CA', 'QC'),
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('RI', 'QC'),
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('IC', 'RP'),
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {0, 1},
        'GSL': {0, 1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {0, 1},
        'RP': {0, 1},
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('CA', 'PO'),
        ('CA', 'GSL'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('RI', 'QC'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('QC', 'GSL'),
        ('PO', 'D'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('D', 'RP'),
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Equivalence:** No pairs are defined.
- **Always Before:** `CA` must occur before `RI`, `PI`, and `QC`.
- **Always After:** `RI` must occur after `CA`, and `PI` and `QC` must occur after `RI`.
- **Never Together:** `PO` and `GSL` cannot happen together, and `IC` and `RP` cannot happen together.
- **Activity Occurrences:** Each activity is likely to occur once, but some like `PO`, `GSL`, `IC`, and `RP` might not occur at all.
- **Directly-Follows Constraints:** The activities are directly followed as described in the process.

This structure ensures that the order fulfillment process follows the specified constraints and can be validated and analyzed effectively.
