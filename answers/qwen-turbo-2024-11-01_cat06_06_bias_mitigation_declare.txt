Certainly! Below is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints added to mitigate potential biases in the loan application process. Each new constraint is designed to ensure fairness and consistency in decision-making, particularly when sensitive attributes are involved.

### Updated `declare_model` Dictionary

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {

        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},

    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},

### Explanation of Added Constraints

1. **Existence of Additional Activities:**
   - **`ManualReview`:** Ensures that a manual review step exists in the process.
   - **`BiasMitigationCheck`:** Introduces a bias mitigation check step to ensure fairness.
   - **`CheckApplicantRace`:** Adds a step to check the applicant's race.
   - **`Approve_Minority`:** Adds a decision step for approving minority applicants.
   - **`Reject_Minority`:** Adds a decision step for rejecting minority applicants.

2. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - **`Approve_Minority` & `Reject_Minority`:** Ensure that a `ManualReview` step always coexists with a decision step involving minority applicants. This prevents decisions from being made without a thorough review.

3. **Response Constraints:**
   - **`BiasMitigationCheck` & `FinalDecision`:** Enforces that a `BiasMitigationCheck` must occur before a `FinalDecision` is made, ensuring that sensitive information is reviewed for fairness.

4. **Precedence Constraints:**
   - **`CheckApplicantRace` & `BiasMitigationCheck`:** Ensures that a `BiasMitigationCheck` follows the `CheckApplicantRace` step, preventing immediate decisions based solely on sensitive attributes.

5. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - **`CheckApplicantRace` & `FinalDecision`:** Ensures that a `FinalDecision` cannot directly follow a `CheckApplicantRace` step, preventing immediate biased outcomes.

By adding these constraints, the process ensures that sensitive attributes are properly reviewed and mitigated before any final decisions are made, thereby reducing the risk of bias in the loan application process.
