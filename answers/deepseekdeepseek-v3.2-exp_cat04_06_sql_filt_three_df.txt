Here's a DuckDB SQL query that solves your problem:

```sql
WITH cases_with_sequence AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      timestamp,
      LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
      LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
      LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
      LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
  ) sequenced_events
  WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
    AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAYS
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_with_sequence)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

**Explanation of the approach:**

1. **Identify the sequence with timing condition:**
   - Use window functions (`LEAD`) to look ahead at the next two activities and their timestamps for each event
   - Filter for rows where the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'
   - Calculate the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events
   - Only keep cases where this time difference exceeds 5 days

2. **Exclude matching cases:**
   - Use a `NOT IN` clause to filter out all events from cases that were identified in the first step
   - Return all events from cases that don't meet the exclusion criteria

3. **Final result:**
   - Returns all columns from the original event log
   - Only includes events from cases that either:
     - Don't have the specified sequence at all, OR
     - Have the sequence but the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is 5 days or less

The query handles the requirement by first identifying the problematic cases, then excluding all events from those cases from the final result set.
