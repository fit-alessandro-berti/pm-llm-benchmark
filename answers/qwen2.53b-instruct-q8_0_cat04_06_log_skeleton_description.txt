The given data appears to be a series of interdependent and conditional actions or activities, likely related to financial approval processes within an organization. Let's break down the elements and constraints provided:

1. **Types of Activities:**
   - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`: This is where an employee submits their request.
   - `Request Payment`: Indicates a specific type of declaration that might be submitted for payment handling.
   - `Payment Handled`: Indicates completion or resolution related to the financial processing of payments.
   - Various approval declarations: `Final_APPROVED`, `Approve by ADMINISTRATION`, and `FOR_APPROVAL` by different approvers (`SUPERVISOR`, `PRE_APPROVER`, `BUDGET OWNER`). These indicate approvals that lead to either further actions (e.g., payment handling) or rejections of the request.

2. **Key Actors:**
   - Employee submits initial declarations.
   - Superiors (SUPervisor and ADMINISTRATION) make approval decisions which can be final or intermediate.
   - Pre-approver is another level of review that can lead to further action or rejection before reaching superiors.
   - Budget Owner might be involved in specific budgetary checks.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The `DIRECTLY-FOLLOWS` constraints help establish the sequence and dependencies between actions:
     - (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`) suggests that a request for approval can either get rejected or be re-submitted.
     - (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`, `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`) implies intermediate steps (pre-approvals) can lead to further actions before reaching the final supervisor approval.
     - (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`): This indicates that an initial submission must first go through administrative review before moving on.

4. **Logical Flow:**
   - An employee submits a request for payment or financial declaration (e.g., Declaration).
   - This declaration is then routed to pre-approvals, who can either approve, reject, or leave it pending further action.
   - If approved by the pre-approver, the request may go through additional layers of review. 
   - Upon reaching the final approval levels (SUPervisor and ADMINISTRATION), the request will either be finalized for payment handling or rejected.
   - Rejections can happen at any point from submission to final approval, with different reasons (e.g., `REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`, `REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`).

5. **Summary:**
   The data outlines a hierarchical process where initial requests are submitted by employees and then sequentially reviewed through multiple layers of decision-making until the request is either finalized for payment or rejected at various stages.
   
This structure suggests that any action in this chain impacts subsequent actions, with each rejection potentially leading to further rework or delays before the final approval stage. The system seems designed around a risk management strategy where approvals are staggered and closely monitored throughout its lifecycle.

The overall goal of such an approval process is likely ensuring accountability, adherence to organizational rules, and proper use of funds.
