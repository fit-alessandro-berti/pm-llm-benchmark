Certainly! Let's analyze the declarative constraints provided to better understand the process model and its structure. Each constraint describes a relationship between different activities within the process, which influences how they can occur relative to each other.

### Equivalence Constraints:
These constraints indicate that two activities must always co-occur (if one occurs, so does the other). For example:

1. **('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')**
2. **('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER')**
3. **('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')**

These imply that when a `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL` occurs under either the `ADMINISTRATION` or `SUPERVISOR`, it is always followed by an additional specific action (`FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` or `APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`). The `REJECTED by MISSING` constraint also ensures that whenever there's a `FOR_APPROVAL` with `SUPERVISOR`, it must be preceded by a `REJECTED by MISSING`.

### Always Before Constraints:
These constraints specify that one activity must always occur before another. For example:

1. **('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')**
2. **('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')**

This means that whenever a `FOR_APPROVAL` occurs under either the `SUPERVISOR` or `PRE_APPROVER`, it must be followed immediately by a `SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`.

### Always After Constraints:
These constraints specify when one activity must occur after another. For example:

1. **('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')**
2. **('Payment Handled', 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE')**

This implies that whenever a `FOR_APPROVAL` occurs under `PRE_APPROVER`, it must be followed immediately by a `REJECTED by MISSING`. Also, after the completion of `Payment Handled`, there must be an occurrence of `REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`.

### Never Together Constraints:
These constraints indicate activities that cannot co-occur in any single case. For example:

1. **('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION')**
2. **('Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE')**

This ensures that a `FOR_APPROVAL` with the `SUPERVISOR` cannot be followed by a `REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`, and similarly, saving an employee’s declaration (`SAVED by EMPLOYEE`) cannot co-occur with rejecting it (`REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`).

### Activity Occurrences:
These constraints specify how many times specific activities can occur in the process model. For example:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7**
   - This means the `SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` activity can appear from 0 to 7 times.
   
2. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4**
   - This means the `APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION` activity can appear from 0 to 4 times.

### Directly-Follows Constraints:
These constraints specify a direct sequence where one activity must follow another. For example:

1. **('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')**
2. **('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')**

This implies that whenever there is an occurrence of `FOR_APPROVAL` under either the `SUPERVISOR` or `PRE_APPROVER`, it must be followed immediately by a `REJECTED by MISSING`.

### Process Description:
Based on the given constraints, here’s how you can describe the process:

1. **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL** (by ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER): This is a core activity that starts the approval process.
2. **SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: Once a `FOR_APPROVAL` occurs, it must be submitted to an employee.
3. **REJECTED by MISSING**: If the submission leads to rejection, there’s a specific phase where this happens (e.g., missing information).
4. **APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**: There are multiple ways the `FOR_APPROVAL` can be approved.
5. **REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**: There are similar rejection paths.
6. **Payment Handled**: After some approvals or rejections, there is a step where payment handling occurs.

### Example Flow:
Let's consider an example flow based on the constraints:

1. `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL` by `SUPERVISOR`.
2. `REJECTED by MISSING`.
3. A submission (`SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) must follow.
4. After submission, there could be further approvals or rejections:
   - **APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**.
   - **APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER** (which can lead to additional `FOR_APPROVAL` activities).
   - **REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**, leading to a final rejection and handling the payment (`Payment Handled`).

### Summary:
The process is driven by declarations of approvals or rejections, with each step having specific constraints on when other actions should occur. The model ensures that all paths through the process are well-defined and mutually exclusive in terms of co-occurrences (except for certain equivalence relationships).
