**2. Potential rootcause patterns**

| Pattern | Evidence in the log | Why it hurts cycle time |
|---------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Escalation to a higherlevel team** | Cases102 and105 contain an “Escalate to Level2 Agent” event. | Handoffs introduce waiting for the next team’s availability, additional coordination, and often a reset of the investigation clock. |
| **Long idle periods between activities** | • 104: Assign09:30  Investigate13:00 (3.5h wait)  <br>• 105: Escalate09:10  Investigate14:00 next day (28h wait)  <br>• 102: Escalate11:30  Investigate14:00 (2.5h wait)  <br>• 102: Investigate14:00  Resolve09:00 next day (19h wait) | Idle time is “wasted” capacity – the ticket sits in a queue while the responsible resource is unavailable or not yet assigned. |
| **Repeated investigation after escalation** | 105 shows two “Investigate Issue” events (before and after escalation). | The first investigation is effectively discarded, so work is duplicated and the overall timeline stretches. |
| **Crossday handoffs** | 104 and 102 close on the next calendar day; 105 spans two full days. | When work spills over midnight, it often means the ticket was not addressed within the same shift, leading to handoff delays and loss of momentum. |
| **Lack of parallel work** | All cases follow a strictly sequential chain (Receive  Triage  Assign  Investigate  Resolve  Close). | If any step is delayed, the whole case stalls; no “fasttrack” or parallel investigation is possible. |

**3. How these factors increase cycle time & recommendations**

| Factor | Impact on cycle time | Practical recommendations |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **Escalations** | Adds at least one extra handoff and often a waiting period for the higherlevel team. | • Define a **SLA for escalation response** (e.g., Level2 must acknowledge within 30min). <br>• Use a **triage matrix** to route only truly complex tickets to Level2, reducing unnecessary escalations. |
| **Idle time between activities** | Directly inflates the total duration; the ticket is “blocked”. | • Implement **automatic alerts** when a ticket stays >30min in a state. <br>• Adopt a **pullbased queue** (e.g., Kanban) so agents see and pick up waiting tickets immediately. |
| **Duplicate investigation after escalation** | Work done before escalation is wasted, extending the timeline. | • Allow the **original investigation notes** to be transferred automatically to Level2, avoiding rework. <br>• Consider **parallel investigation**: while escalation is pending, the Level1 agent can continue gathering information. |
| **Crossday handoffs** | Shifts change, causing tickets to sit idle overnight. | • Align **shift schedules** with SLA windows, or provide **oncall coverage** for critical tickets. <br>• Use **overnight automation** (e.g., autoassign to a nightshift pool). |
| **Strict sequential flow** | Any delay propagates downstream. | • Introduce **parallel activities** where possible (e.g., start resolution while investigation is still ongoing if the issue is partially understood). <br>• Apply **process mining** to identify “fasttrack” subpaths for lowcomplexity tickets. |

### Quick win checklist for the current data set

1. **Escalation SLA** – enforce a 30min acknowledgment for Level2; currently 102 waited ~28h before the second investigation, 105 waited ~28h after escalation.  
2. **Queue visibility** – a dashboard that highlights tickets idle >1h between “Assign” and “Investigate”.  
3. **Knowledge transfer** – automatically attach the Level1 investigation notes to the Level2 ticket to avoid reinvestigation.  
4. **Shift handoff protocol** – ensure tickets in “Investigate” at shift end are either resolved or formally handed over, not left idle overnight.  

Implementing these measures should shrink the longtail cases (102,104,105) toward the baseline 1–3h range observed for tickets101and103, improving overall support performance.
