Sure, here is an example of a temporal profile dictionary for the given supply chain process activities. Note that the values provided are estimated and can vary based on real-world data:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 1800),  # Supplier Selection to Order Placement
    ('OP', 'RC'): (172800, 28800),  # Order Placement to Receive Components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 1800),  # Receive Components to Quality Inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 3600),  # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (10800, 2700),  # Component Assembly to Product Testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 1800),  # Product Testing to Packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 3600),  # Packaging to Warehouse Storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (43200, 14400),  # Warehouse Storage to Distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 28800),  # Distribution to After-Sales Support
    ('SS', 'RC'): (182400, 36000),  # Supplier Selection to Receive Components
    ('SS', 'QI'): (189600, 43200),  # Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection
    ('SS', 'CA'): (196800, 48000),  # Supplier Selection to Component Assembly
    ('SS', 'PK'): (204000, 51600),  # Supplier Selection to Packaging
    ('SS', 'WS'): (211200, 54000),  # Supplier Selection to Warehouse Storage
