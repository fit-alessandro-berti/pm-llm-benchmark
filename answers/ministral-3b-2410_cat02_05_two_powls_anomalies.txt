### Analysis of POWL Models

#### POWL Model 1

**Model Structure:**
- **Activities:** Post_Job_Ad, Screen_Candidates, Conduct_Interviews, Make_Hiring_Decision, Onboard_Employee, Add_to_Payroll, Close_Case
- **Order of Activities:**
  - Post_Job_Ad -> Screen_Candidates
  - Screen_Candidates -> Make_Hiring_Decision
  - Screen_Candidates -> Conduct_Interviews
  - Make_Hiring_Decision -> Onboard_Employee
  - Onboard_Employee -> Add_to_Payroll
  - Add_to_Payroll -> Close_Case

**Anomalies:**
1. **Concurrent Activities:** The model allows for concurrent execution of `Screen_Candidates` and `Conduct_Interviews` after `Post_Job_Ad`. In a standard process, these activities should be sequential.
2. **Unnecessary Path:** The path `Screen_Candidates -> Make_Hiring_Decision` is followed, but there is no direct path from `Make_Hiring_Decision` to `Conduct_Interviews`. This suggests that the decision to conduct interviews might be bypassed, which is not typical.

#### POWL Model 2

**Model Structure:**
- **Activities:** Post_Job_Ad, Screen_Candidates, Conduct_Interviews, Make_Hiring_Decision, Onboard_Employee, Add_to_Payroll, Close_Case
- **Order of Activities:**
  - Post_Job_Ad -> Screen_Candidates
  - Post_Job_Ad -> Conduct_Interviews
  - Conduct_Interviews -> Make_Hiring_Decision
  - Make_Hiring_Decision -> Onboard_Employee (with a loop)
  - Onboard_Employee -> Add_to_Payroll (with an XOR)
  - Add_to_Payroll -> Close_Case

**Anomalies:**
1. **Loop and XOR:** The use of a loop (`Onboard_Employee`) and an XOR (`Add_to_Payroll`) introduces complexity and potential for confusion. In a standard process, these activities should be straightforward and sequential.
2. **Concurrent Activities:** The model allows for concurrent execution of `Conduct_Interviews` and `Screen_Candidates` after `Post_Job_Ad`, which is not typical.
3. **Unnecessary Paths:** The loop and XOR operators suggest that there might be multiple ways to handle the `Onboard_Employee` and `Add_to_Payroll` activities, which could lead to confusion and inefficiency.

### Comparison and Justification

**POWL Model 1:**
- **Pros:** The model is relatively straightforward and follows a clear sequence of activities.
- **Cons:** The concurrent execution of `Screen_Candidates` and `Conduct_Interviews` and the bypass of the interview decision path are anomalies that deviate from standard practice.

**POWL Model 2:**
- **Pros:** The model introduces loops and XOR operators, which could theoretically allow for more flexibility in handling certain activities.
- **Cons:** The use of loops and XOR operators introduces complexity and potential for confusion. The concurrent execution of `Conduct_Interviews` and `Screen_Candidates` and the multiple paths for `Onboard_Employee` and `Add_to_Payroll` are significant deviations from standard practice.

### Conclusion

**Which Model More Closely Aligns with a Normative Version of the Hire-to-Retire Process?**

**POWL Model 1** more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process. While it has some anomalies, such as concurrent execution of `Screen_Candidates` and `Conduct_Interviews`, and the bypass of the interview decision path, these are less severe compared to the complexity and potential for confusion introduced by the loops and XOR operators in **POWL Model 2**.

The standard Hire-to-Retire process typically involves a clear sequence of activities with minimal branching or looping. Therefore, **POWL Model 1** is more aligned with this standard, despite its minor anomalies.
