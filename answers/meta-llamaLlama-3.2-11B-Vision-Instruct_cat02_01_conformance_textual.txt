**Violating Cases and Their Violations:**

1.  **Case 2:**
    *   **Violation:** "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment," which is the expected flow in cases where inventory sufficiency has been confirmed and payment authorization follows.
    *   **Reason:** The activities in Case 2 should have proceeded as follows: Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package, Ship, Close (since inventory was sufficient, as indicated by the series of consistent, order-fulfilling activities). However, it deviates from this by packaging before payment authorization.
2.  **Case 3:**
    *   **Violation:** After "Cancel order," the next activities were "Ship order" and then "Close order." In scenarios with insufficient inventory, after canceling the order, it should not proceed with shipping or close the order in the context provided since shipping cannot occur after a cancellation.
    *   **Reason:** Given that inventory was insufficient (as indicated by the direct move to "Cancel order" after checking inventory), the typical sequence would have been to immediately cancel the order and then finalize with closing the order. However, it incorrectly includes shipping activities after cancellation.
3.  **Case 4:**
    *   **Violation:** After checking inventory, the process proceeded to "Cancel order" and then immediately "Close order." This sequence diverges from the typical path for insufficient inventory, where a "Cancel order" activity would precede closing the order, as 'Close order' should only follow 'Ship order' if inventory is sufficient, or directly after 'Cancel order' in the case of insufficient inventory.
    *   **Reason:** The correct sequence for insufficient inventory scenarios is Check, Cancel, Close. This case, however, closes the order without shipping, directly following a cancellation, which doesn't align with the expected flow.
4.  **Case 5:**
    *   **Violation:** Although cases with enough inventory follow the intended sequence (Receive, Check, Authorize payment, Package, Ship, Close), Case 5 simply skips over "Check inventory" and proceeds directly to "Authorize payment." Since inventory is a crucial factor in whether an order should be fulfilled or canceled, omitting the inventory check is a violation.
    *   **Reason:** The critical step of "Check inventory" should precede "Authorize payment" since payment authorization should only occur after determining the inventory status. Omitting the inventory check means the payment authorization is not adequately preceded by the required step.
