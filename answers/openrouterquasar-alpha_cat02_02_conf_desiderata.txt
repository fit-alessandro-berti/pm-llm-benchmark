Certainly! Here's a detailed analysis based on the scenario, constraints, and event log.

### **1. Identification of Normative Rule Violations**

**Case 1:**  
- **No violations.**  
- **Reason:** This case perfectly follows the normative process:  
  - Proper activity order: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
  - Documentation is finalized because the loan is approved.  
  - No steps skipped or contradictory actions.

**Case 2:**  
- **Violations:**  
  - **Ordering Violation:** Risk Assessment occurs **before** the Credit Check (`Risk Assessment` at 08:20, `Credit Check` at 09:00), violating the rule that credit check **must precede** risk assessment.  
  - **Contradictory Action:** Despite a `Loan Decision (Rejected)`, the process performs `Finalize Documentation` before closure (Finalize at 10:00, Loan rejected at 09:30), which **should not happen** per the rule that documentation is **not** finalized on rejection.  
  
- **Summary:**  
  This case **breaks strict process rules** regarding task order as well as decision-conditional actions.

**Case 3:**  
- **No normative violations.**  
- **Reason:**  
  - Activity sequence is correct: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.  
  - Since the loan was approved, finalizing documentation before closing is correct.  
  - No steps skipped or contradictory actions.  
  - The delays noted are only desirable timing preferences, not strict violations.

### **2. Identification of Desiderata (Recommended but NOT strict) Deviations**

**Case 1:**  
- **Fully compliant**, no notable delay or skipped recommendations.  
- Credit check and notification occur promptly, and overall ideal behavior observed.

**Case 2:**  
- **Not assessed for desiderata due to normative violations.** When a case violates strict rules, desiderata become secondary; however, from timestamps, process timing looks prompt.

**Case 3:**  
- **Misses several desiderata, but no severe issues:**  
  - **Delay in Credit Check:**  
    - Application received: Jan 12, 09:00  
    - Credit check done: **January 14, 10:00** (~49 hours later), exceeding recommended 24 hours.  
  - **Delay in Informing Applicant:**  
    - Decision made: Jan 14, 12:00  
    - Inform applicant: **January 16, 15:00** (~51 hours later), exceeding the 48-hour recommendation.  
  - **Omitted follow-up call:**  
    - No follow-up call recorded before closing case.  
    - While encouraged to perform one, it is only a best practice, not a strict requirement.

- **Interpretation:**  
  These are **suboptimal behaviors** but **do not constitute strict violations**. They may indicate process inefficiencies or resource constraints rather than outright errors.

### **3. Interpretations and Justifications**

- **Normative violations (case 2) indicate serious process non-conformance**—likely causing compliance issues and potential risks.  
  - **Performing risk assessment before credit check** undermines the assessment's validity.  
  - **Finalizing documentation upon rejection** could lead to unnecessary work or even legal complications.  
  - Such errors suggest training or system enforcement gaps.

- **Desiderata deviations (case 3) show room for improvement:**  
  - **Delays** might be caused by workload, applicant responsiveness, or backlog.  
  - **No follow-up call** might be due to client non-availability or skipped to speed processing.  
  - These don't threaten compliance—only efficiency and customer satisfaction.

- **In practice:**  
  - Enforcing stricter checks for sequence and decision-dependent actions is critical.  
  - Following best practices (desiderata) helps improve service and reduce cycle times but can be balanced flexibly.

### **Summary Table**

| Case | Normative Violations | Desiderata Shortcomings | Comments |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| **1** | None                   | None                     | Ideal execution |
| **2** | Yes:  
• Risk before Credit Check  
• Finalization after Rejection | None notable (timing is prompt) | Strict process breach |
| **3** | None                   |  
• Late Credit Check (>24h)  
• Late Notification (>48h)  
• Skipped Follow-up Call | Suboptimal timing, acceptable |

---

**Overall:**  
- **Case 1** is fully compliant and ideal.  
- **Case 2** violates strict mandatory process rules and is non-conforming.  
- **Case 3** respects the mandatory order but deviates from non-strict best practices, indicating opportunities to enhance performance.
