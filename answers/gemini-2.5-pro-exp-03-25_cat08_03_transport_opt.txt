## Process Mining Consultancy Report: Speedy Parcels Delivery Operations Analysis

**Objective:** To analyze Speedy Parcels' last-mile delivery operations using process mining techniques on their collected event data, identify root causes for late deliveries and high operational costs, and recommend data-driven optimization strategies.

---

**1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

*   **Data Preprocessing and Integration:**
    *   **Goal:** Create a single, unified event log where each row represents a distinct event in the delivery process, linked to a specific case (e.g., a vehicle's operational day).
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **Case ID Definition:** Define a primary Case ID. `Vehicle-Day` (e.g., V12-20241205) seems suitable as it captures the operational context of a single vehicle for a day. Package-level analysis might require linking `Package ID` as an attribute or potentially creating sub-cases if granularity demands.
        2.  **Activity Definition:** Standardize event types into meaningful activities. Examples: `Start Shift`, `Load Vehicle` (inferred from first 'Scan at Depot' cluster), `Depart Depot`, `Travel`, `Arrive Customer`, `Service Customer` (combining Arrive/Success/Failed/Depart), `Delivery Success`, `Delivery Failed`, `Unplanned Stop` (derived from GPS idle time outside known locations), `Maintenance`, `Return Travel`, `Arrive Depot`, `End Shift`. GPS data needs abstraction: sequences of 'Moving' status become 'Travel'; 'Idle' status at non-customer/depot locations becomes 'Unplanned Stop' or potentially 'Traffic Delay' if correlated with low speed.
        3.  **Timestamp Alignment:** Ensure all timestamps are standardized (e.g., UTC) and chronologically ordered within each Case ID. Address potential discrepancies between systems (e.g., GPS time vs. Scanner time). Event correlation might be needed (e.g., matching a GPS 'Idle' event near a customer location with a 'Arrive Customer' scan).
        4.  **Attribute Enrichment:** Integrate relevant data points as event attributes: `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Package ID` (where applicable), `Location (Lat/Lon)`, `Speed`, `Vehicle Status`, `Planned Stop Number`, `Customer Time Window`, `Maintenance Type`, `Failed Delivery Reason`. Link planned route data from the dispatch system to the corresponding case.
    *   **Potential Challenges:**
        *   **Timestamp Synchronization:** Different systems might have clock drift or record events at different points (e.g., GPS reports location *before* scanner registers arrival). Requires careful correlation logic.
        *   **Data Granularity:** High-frequency GPS data needs aggregation to create meaningful 'Travel' or 'Idle' activities without overwhelming the log. Scanner events are discrete milestones.
        *   **Defining Activities:** Inferring activities like 'Travel' or 'Unplanned Stop' from raw GPS data requires careful rule definition (e.g., speed thresholds, geofencing known locations). Distinguishing planned waits from unplanned delays.
        *   **Data Quality:** Missing events (e.g., driver forgot to scan), inaccurate GPS readings, inconsistent data entry in maintenance logs. Requires data cleansing and potentially imputation or exclusion rules.
        *   **Linking Data:** Reliably connecting specific package scans to the overall vehicle-day case and correlating maintenance events occurring mid-route.

*   **Process Discovery:**
    *   **Technique:** Apply process discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner, Heuristics Miner) to the integrated event log.
    *   **Visualization:** Generate process maps visually representing the *actual* flow of activities. This map will show:
        *   The typical sequence: Depot -> Travel -> Stop (Arrive/Service/Depart) -> Travel -> ... -> Return Travel -> Depot.
        *   Variations: Loops for re-attempts after failed deliveries, detours for unscheduled maintenance, paths showing unplanned stops (e.g., long idle times inferred from GPS).
        *   Frequencies: Highlight common paths (dominant process) versus infrequent variations (edge cases, exceptions).
        *   Parallelism: If multiple packages are handled concurrently at a stop, this might appear.

*   **Conformance Checking:**
    *   **Technique:** Compare the discovered process models ("as-is") against the *planned* routes and schedules from the dispatch system ("to-be" or "should-be").
    *   **Method:** Use conformance checking algorithms that overlay event log traces onto the planned model or compare model structures.
    *   **Deviations to Look For:**
        *   **Sequence Deviations:** Drivers delivering stops in a different order than planned.
        *   **Unplanned Activities:** Activities occurring that were not part of the plan (e.g., `Unplanned Stop`, `Maintenance` during route, unexpected long `Idle` periods).
        *   **Skipped Activities:** Planned delivery stops that were missed entirely (not even attempted).
        *   **Timing Deviations:** Significant discrepancies between planned vs. actual durations for `Travel` activities (indicating traffic or routing issues) and `Service Customer` activities (indicating issues at the stop). Also, checking `Arrive Customer` against the planned time window.
        *   **Resource Deviations:** Unexpected driver or vehicle changes mid-route (less common but possible).

**2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Calculation:**
    *   **On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate:** `COUNT(Deliveries where Actual 'Arrive Customer' Timestamp <= End of Customer Time Window) / COUNT(Total Deliveries with Time Windows)`. Requires linking delivery events to dispatch data's time windows.
    *   **Average Time per Delivery Stop (Service Time):** `AVG(Timestamp('Depart Customer') - Timestamp('Arrive Customer'))`. Calculated per stop, can be aggregated by route, driver, area, etc.
    *   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** `SUM(Duration of 'Travel' activities) / SUM(Duration of 'Service Customer' activities)` per case (Vehicle-Day). High ratio suggests excessive driving relative to servicing customers.
    *   **Fuel Consumption Efficiency (Proxy):** `Total Distance Travelled (from GPS) / Total Packages Delivered` or `Total Distance Travelled / Total Operational Hours`. If fuel sensor data is available, calculate `Liters Consumed / km` or `Liters Consumed / Package`. Correlate high fuel use with excessive idle time (`SUM(Duration of 'Idle' activities where Speed = 0)`).
    *   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** `SUM(Duration from 'Depart Depot' to 'Arrive Depot') / SUM(Duration from 'Start Shift' to 'End Shift')`. Measures productive time vs. total paid time. Can also measure `Time Spent Moving / Total Operational Time`.
    *   **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:** Identify 'Travel' segments with average speed below a threshold (e.g., < 15 km/h in urban areas) or use explicit `Low Speed Detected` events. Calculate `COUNT(Delay Incidents)` and `AVG/SUM(Duration of Delays)`.
    *   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** `COUNT('Delivery Failed' events) / COUNT(Total Delivery Attempts ('Delivery Success' + 'Delivery Failed'))`. Can be broken down by reason code if available.
    *   **Cycle Time:** `AVG(Timestamp('Arrive Depot' at end of day) - Timestamp('Depart Depot' at start of day))` per case. Overall duration of the route.

*   **Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**
    *   **Performance Overlays on Process Map:** Visualize KPIs directly on the discovered process map. Highlight activities (nodes) or transitions (arcs) with long average durations (e.g., specific 'Travel' legs, long 'Service Customer' times at certain locations/customer types). Show average waiting times between activities.
    *   **Duration Analysis:** Analyze the distribution of durations for key activities (`Travel`, `Service Customer`, `Idle`). Identify activities with high averages, high variability, or long tails (extreme outliers).
    *   **Filtering and Comparative Analysis:** Filter the event log based on context (e.g., specific routes, time of day, day of week, driver, vehicle type, weather conditions if available) and compare process maps and KPIs. This helps isolate if bottlenecks are specific to certain conditions (e.g., "Route 5 always experiences long delays between 4-6 PM", "Driver X has significantly longer service times", "Van Type Y has more breakdowns").
    *   **Resource Analysis:** Analyze performance metrics per driver or vehicle (e.g., average stop time, travel speed, idle time, breakdown frequency) to see if bottlenecks are linked to specific resources.
    *   **Quantification:** Measure the impact by calculating the total time lost at bottlenecks (e.g., `Frequency of Bottleneck Activity * Average Excess Duration`). For example, calculate the total hours lost per month due to traffic delays on specific road segments identified via GPS analysis.

**3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

*   **Potential Root Causes:**
    *   **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Planned routes may not account for real-time conditions, historical traffic patterns discovered via GPS, access restrictions, or efficient drop-off sequencing, leading to longer travel times. (Conformance checking showing sequence deviations, long travel times).
    *   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:** Dispatch system's estimates might be overly optimistic or not granular enough, leading to unrealistic schedules and late deliveries. (Performance analysis showing consistent negative variance between actual vs. planned travel time).
    *   **Traffic Congestion:** High impact of predictable (rush hour) and unpredictable (accidents) traffic. (GPS analysis correlating low speeds/idle times with specific locations/times; bottleneck analysis showing long travel times on certain segments).
    *   **High Service Time Variability:** Unpredictable time spent at customer locations due to parking difficulties, building access issues, customer not ready, long walks, complex delivery requirements. (Duration analysis of 'Service Customer' activity showing high variance; possible correlation with location type or notes).
    *   **Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance:** Unscheduled downtime significantly disrupts routes and causes delays. Proactive maintenance might be lacking. (Analysis of `Maintenance` events, correlation with vehicle age/type/usage patterns from log).
    *   **Driver Behavior/Skill:** Differences in driving efficiency (speed, route adherence), parking strategies, organizational skills at the stop, or adherence to procedures. (Resource analysis comparing KPIs across drivers, variant analysis comparing driver paths for similar routes).
    *   **Failed Delivery Attempts:** Customer unavailability leads to wasted time, fuel, and effort, often requiring costly re-delivery routes. (High `Rate of Failed Deliveries`, analysis of reasons, loop patterns in process map for re-attempts).
    *   **Depot Operations:** Delays in loading or dispatching vehicles at the start of the day. (Analyzing time between `Start Shift` / `Route Assigned` and `Depart Depot`).

*   **Validation using Process Mining:**
    *   **Variant Analysis:** Compare the process maps and performance metrics of high-performing cases (e.g., on-time, low cost) versus low-performing cases (e.g., late, high cost). Identify structural differences (different paths taken) or performance differences (bottlenecks prominent only in low-performing variants). E.g., Compare routes with vs. without maintenance events. Compare drivers with high vs. low OTD rates.
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Correlate specific events or attributes with poor performance. E.g., Do routes with `Unplanned Stop` events have significantly higher cycle times? Does `Low Speed Detected` correlate strongly with late arrivals at the next stop? Is high 'Service Time' correlated with specific building types or delivery notes?
    *   **Dwell Time Analysis:** Analyze the duration of 'Idle' or 'Service Customer' states at different location types or under different conditions (e.g., time of day, package type) to pinpoint reasons for service time variability.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis Features (in Tools):** Some process mining tools offer dedicated features to statistically identify influencing factors on KPIs (e.g., identifying that 'Traffic Delay' events are the strongest driver of late deliveries).

**4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

Here are three distinct strategies:

1.  **Strategy: Implement Dynamic Routing and Predictive ETAs**
    *   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Excessive travel time, delays due to traffic, inability to react to real-time conditions.
    *   **Underlying Root Cause:** Static route plans, inaccurate travel time estimations, impact of traffic congestion.
    *   **Process Mining Support:** Conformance checking reveals deviations from planned routes and timings. Performance analysis pinpoints bottlenecks related to specific high-traffic segments and times identified from GPS `Low Speed Detected` / long `Travel` durations. Variant analysis shows successful routes often deviate dynamically.
    *   **Proposal:** Integrate real-time traffic data (from external providers) with the dispatch system. Use insights from historical GPS data (mined traffic patterns) to improve baseline estimates. Implement algorithms that can re-route vehicles dynamically based on current conditions and predictive ETAs derived from both real-time data and historical process mining insights (e.g., typical service times for *that specific area* or *customer type*).
    *   **Expected KPI Impact:** Reduced Average Travel Time, Improved OTD Rate, Reduced Fuel Consumption (less idling/rerouting), potentially improved Vehicle Utilization.

2.  **Strategy: Optimize Delivery Time Windows and Proactive Customer Communication**
    *   **Targeted Inefficiency:** High rate of failed deliveries, high service time variability, wasted resources on re-delivery attempts.
    *   **Underlying Root Cause:** Customer unavailability during fixed delivery windows, communication gaps.
    *   **Process Mining Support:** High frequency of `Delivery Failed` events in the process map, particularly loops indicating re-attempts. Analysis of failure reasons (if logged). High variance identified in `Service Customer` duration analysis. Correlation analysis may link failed deliveries to specific times or customer segments.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   Use historical delivery success/failure data (mined from scanner events) correlated with time-of-day and location to suggest optimized, possibly narrower, delivery windows during planning.
        *   Implement an automated notification system (SMS/email) providing customers with a more precise ETA (based on the dynamic routing system) and potentially options to reschedule easily if they won't be available. Offer options like 'Leave with neighbor' or 'Safe place delivery' captured via the scanner to reduce failures.
    *   **Expected KPI Impact:** Reduced Rate of Failed Deliveries, Reduced Average Time per Stop (less waiting/searching), Lower operational costs (fewer re-deliveries), Improved Customer Satisfaction.

3.  **Strategy: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling based on Usage Profiles**
    *   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Unscheduled vehicle breakdowns during routes, high emergency repair costs, associated delivery delays.
    *   **Underlying Root Cause:** Reactive maintenance schedules, potential correlation between specific usage patterns and failures not captured by standard mileage/time-based checks.
    *   **Process Mining Support:** Process maps showing disruptive `Maintenance` activities mid-route. Analysis correlating `Maintenance` event frequency/type with vehicle attributes (age, model) and *actual usage patterns* derived from the log (e.g., high idle times, frequent stop-starts typical of urban routes, high mileage on specific challenging routes, engine alerts captured via GPS).
    *   **Proposal:** Develop predictive maintenance models using machine learning on the event log data. Correlate historical maintenance records (`Maintenance Logs`) with detailed operational data (GPS-derived mileage, engine hours, idle time, route types, speed profiles, potentially sensor alerts if available). Identify patterns that predict failures *before* they happen. Schedule maintenance proactively based on these predicted risks rather than fixed intervals alone. Allocate vehicles to routes based on suitability and maintenance needs.
    *   **Expected KPI Impact:** Reduced frequency of unscheduled downtime, Lower emergency repair costs, Improved Vehicle Reliability, potentially extended vehicle lifespan, fewer delivery delays caused by breakdowns.

---

**5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

*   **Accounting for Constraints:**
    *   **Dynamic Routing:** Must incorporate driver working hours (HOS regulations), mandatory breaks, vehicle capacity limits, and committed customer time windows as hard constraints in the optimization algorithms. Process mining can help understand the *actual* duration of breaks and loading times to feed realistic parameters into planning.
    *   **Time Windows:** Optimized windows must still be feasible within driver shifts and route density. Customer communication strategies need to manage expectations. Simulation using process mining tools can test the impact of tighter windows on overall route feasibility.
    *   **Predictive Maintenance:** Maintenance needs to be scheduled to minimize operational disruption (e.g., during off-peak hours or synchronizing with low-demand days identified through historical volume analysis). Ensure sufficient fleet availability.

*   **Continuous Monitoring Plan:**
    *   **Dashboards:** Implement real-time or near-real-time process mining dashboards accessible to operations managers.
    *   **Key Metrics to Track:**
        *   Overall KPIs: OTD Rate, Average Cost per Delivery, Failed Delivery Rate, Vehicle Utilization.
        *   Process Conformance: Rate of sequence deviations, frequency of unplanned stops, adherence to planned timings.
        *   Bottleneck Monitoring: Track average durations for key activities/transitions identified as historical bottlenecks (e.g., travel time on specific road segments, service time in specific zones). Set alerts for when these exceed thresholds.
        *   Strategy-Specific Metrics: Track adoption and effectiveness of dynamic routing (e.g., frequency of re-routes, comparison of planned vs. actual ETAs), impact of communication strategy (e.g., reduction in specific failed delivery reason codes), predictive maintenance effectiveness (e.g., reduction in unscheduled repair incidents vs. prediction accuracy).
    *   **Process Views:** Regularly review updated process maps to visualize the impact of changes and identify any *new* emerging bottlenecks or undesirable variations resulting from the optimizations.
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Use the monitoring insights to continuously refine the optimization strategies, update planning parameters, and provide targeted feedback or training to drivers and dispatchers.

By implementing this comprehensive process mining approach, Speedy Parcels can move from suspecting inefficiencies to precisely identifying, quantifying, and addressing them with targeted, data-driven strategies, leading to improved punctuality, reduced costs, and enhanced customer satisfaction.
