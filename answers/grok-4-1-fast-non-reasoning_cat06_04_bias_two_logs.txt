### Identification of Bias
**Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias.** This bias is evident in the systematic favoritism shown toward applicants based on their `LocalResident` status and `CommunityGroup` membership, which results in score inflation not present in Group A.

### Manifestation of Bias
The bias manifests primarily through the **ScoreAdjustment column**, where Group B applicants receive a **+10 "Community Boost"** adjustment under specific conditions, while Group A receives no such boosts (all ScoreAdjustment = 0). Here's a breakdown:

#### Key Comparisons by Case
| Case | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) | Key Difference |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| **High Score (720)** | P001: Approved (no adjustment) | U001: Approved (+10 boost to 730) | U001 gets unnecessary boost despite identical preliminary score and outcome. |
| **Medium Score (710)** | P002: Rejected (no adjustment) | U002: Rejected (no adjustment) | Identical treatment (no community group = no boost). |
| **High Score (740 / 695)** | P003: Approved (no adjustment) | U003: Approved (+10 boost from 695 to 705) | U003's low preliminary score (695) is rescued by boost to secure approval; P003 had no need for boost. |

- **ScoreAdjustment Patterns**:
  - **Group A**: Uniformly 0 across all stages. Decisions are based purely on `PreliminaryScore` (e.g., 720  Approved; 710  Rejected; 740  Approved). No influence from `LocalResident` (always FALSE) or `CommunityGroup` (always None).
  - **Group B**: +10 boost applied **consistently** at PreliminaryScoring, ManualReview, and FinalDecision stages **only when CommunityGroup = "Highland Civic Darts Club"** (U001 and U003). No boost when None (U002).
    - U001: 720  730 (boost, but already approvable).
    - U003: 695  705 (critical boost turns likely rejection into approval).

- **Timestamps and Resources**: Processing times are similar (e.g., ~25-30 min for ManualReview), and resources (e.g., Scoring Engine, Underwriter) are identical. Bias is **not** due to delays or resource allocation but embedded in the scoring logic.

#### Influence of LocalResident and CommunityGroup
- **LocalResident**: Always TRUE in Group B (Unprotected) vs. FALSE in Group A (Protected). This flags Group B for potential community-based evaluation.
- **CommunityGroup**: Acts as a **proxy for preferential treatment** in Group B:
  - "Highland Civic Darts Club"  Automatic +10 boost (2/3 cases).
  - None  No boost (treated like Group A).
- This creates **conditional favoritism**: Unprotected local residents in the club get artificially inflated scores, improving approval odds.

### Systematic Differences in Final Decisions
- **Approval Rates**:
  | Group | Approved | Rejected | Notes |
  |-------|----------|----------|-------|
  | **A (Protected)** | 2/3 (P001, P003) | 1/3 (P002) | Purely merit-based (threshold ~720). |
  | **B (Unprotected)** | 2/3 (U001, U003) | 1/3 (U002) | 1/3 approvals driven by boost (U003); U001 over-boosted. |

- **Impact**:
  - **Disparate Outcomes**: A 695-score in Group B (U003) gets approved post-boost, while an equivalent low score in Group A would likely be rejected (no PXXX case at 695, but pattern suggests <720  Reject).
  - **Predictable Discrimination**: The boost systematically advantages Unprotected locals in the community group, leading to higher effective scores (e.g., 695 becomes competitive). This violates fairness if the goal is uniform thresholds.
  - **Potential Threshold**: Implied approval 720. Boosts push borderline cases over, creating **leniency for Group B** (e.g., U003 crosses threshold; hypothetical 710 +10 =720 would approve U002-like cases).

This is **algorithmic bias** (preferential adjustment rule) favoring Unprotected Group B based on protected attributes (residency/community ties), potentially discriminating against Protected Group A by denying them equivalent boosts. To mitigate, standardize scoring rules across groups.
