# High-Level Process Step Analysis

## Proposed High-Level Activities

Based on the event log analysis, I propose the following **4 high-level process steps**:

### 1. **Material Preparation**
### 2. **Welding Operations**
### 3. **Surface Treatment**
### 4. **Quality Inspection**

---

## Detailed Grouping and Rationale

### **1. Material Preparation**

**Low-level events included:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
- **Logical coherence**: All these activities prepare the raw material for the actual manufacturing work. They transform the material from storage to a work-ready state.
- **Temporal proximity**: These events occur consecutively at the beginning of the process (08:00:05 - 08:00:25).
- **Common objective**: The goal is to have properly identified, positioned, and thermally prepared material before any value-adding operations begin.
- **Resource pattern**: Involves material handling resources (operators, robotic arms, heating units) rather than manufacturing/assembly tools.
- **Prerequisites**: These steps establish the necessary conditions (proper identification, alignment, temperature) for subsequent operations.

**Time span**: ~20 seconds (08:00:05 - 08:00:25)

### **2. Welding Operations**

**Low-level events included:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
- **Functional unity**: All activities are directly related to the welding process, which is the primary value-adding operation.
- **Tool-centric grouping**: These events revolve around a specific tool (W-12) and represent a complete welding cycle.
- **Single operator sequence**: Performed consecutively by the same resource (Operator B) without interruption.
- **Process phase**: Represents the actual assembly/joining phase where parts are permanently connected.
- **Domain logic**: In manufacturing, tool pickup and its application are typically considered part of the same operational phase.

**Time span**: ~20 seconds (08:01:00 - 08:01:20)

---

### **3. Surface Treatment**

**Low-level events included:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:**
- **Process coupling**: These two activities are interdependent—coating must be dried after application.
- **Common purpose**: Both events serve the protective finishing of the product.
- **Sequential dependency**: Drying cannot occur without prior coating application; they form a complete sub-process.
- **Similar resource types**: Both use automated units (Coating Unit, Heating Unit) rather than manual operations.
- **Distinct phase**: Surface treatment is a separate manufacturing phase from joining/assembly, requiring different equipment and serving different quality objectives.

**Time span**: ~15-20 seconds (08:01:30 - 08:01:50)

---

### **4. Quality Inspection**

**Low-level events included:**
- Measure weld integrity
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
- **Verification purpose**: Both activities are non-value-adding verification steps to ensure product quality.
- **Quality control phase**: Represents checkpoints after key manufacturing operations (post-welding and final inspection).
- **Different inspection types**: Combines automated measurement (sensor-based) and manual inspection, providing comprehensive quality assurance.
- **Decision points**: These activities determine whether the product proceeds or requires rework.
- **Temporal distribution**: While not consecutive, both serve the same overarching quality assurance function—one validates the welding, the other provides final approval.

**Time span**: Distributed (08:01:20 and 08:02:00)

## Grouping Principles Applied

1. **Temporal Cohesion**: Events occurring in close succession with no intervening activities from different process phases
2. **Functional Similarity**: Activities serving the same manufacturing objective
3. **Resource Affinity**: Events using similar resource types or the same individual resource
4. **Dependency Relationships**: Activities that must occur in sequence to complete a sub-process
5. **Domain Knowledge**: Manufacturing best practices that logically group preparation, execution, and verification phases

## Benefits of This Abstraction

- **Process Understanding**: Reduces 13 low-level events to 4 understandable phases
- **Performance Analysis**: Enables timing analysis at meaningful process stages
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Makes it easier to identify which phase causes delays
- **Standardization**: Facilitates comparison across different cases
- **Communication**: Provides business-friendly terminology for process discussion

This abstraction maintains traceability to low-level events while providing actionable process intelligence.
