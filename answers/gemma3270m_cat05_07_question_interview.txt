Okay, I'm ready to help you refine your understanding of this property onboarding process. I will focus on clarifying key details, identifying key decision criteria, and exploring the nuances of various aspects. Please provide me with the interviewee's description of their property onboarding process. I will then generate a set of targeted, open-ended questions that will help me understand their thinking and provide you with valuable insights.
