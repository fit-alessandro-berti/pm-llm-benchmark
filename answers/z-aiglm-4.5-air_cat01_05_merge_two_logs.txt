### Merged Event Log

**Format:** `timestamp, order_id, source_systems, event_type, event_name, user_id, resource_id, notes`  
*(Note: Empty fields (`""`) indicate attributes not present in the original log.)*

### Reasoning for Event Matching & Merging

#### **1. Matching Strategy**
- **Primary Key:** Events matched by `order_id` (all events share `Order#1234`).
- **Timestamp Tolerance:** Used a **2-second tolerance** (per requirements). Events with timestamps 2 seconds apart are considered the same.
- **Timestamp Handling:**  
  - **Log A timestamps** were used as the primary timestamp for merged events (since Log A is the "primary timeline").  
  - Log B timestamps were retained as attributes in `notes` (if differing) or discarded if identical.  
  - Unmatched events retain their original timestamp.

#### **2. Event Merging Decisions**
| Log A Event          | Log B Event          | Match? | Timestamp Diff | Reason                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Order Received`     | `OrderReceived`      | **Yes** | 2 seconds      | Within tolerance (10:00:00 vs 10:00:02  Log A timestamp used).       |
| `Order Validated`    | `OrderValidation`    | **Yes** | 1 second       | Within tolerance (10:01:30 vs 10:01:31  Log A timestamp used).       |
| `Payment Processed`  | `PaymentCheck`       | **No**  | 5 seconds      | Exceeds 2-second tolerance (10:02:00 vs 10:02:05).                    |
| `Item Shipped`       | `Shipping`           | **Yes** | 2 seconds      | Within tolerance (10:05:00 vs 10:05:02  Log A timestamp used).       |
| `Item Delivered`     | *(No match in Log B)*| **No**  | N/A            | No Log B event at ~10:20:00.                                           |

#### **3. Handling Unmatched Events**
- **Log A Unmatched (`Payment Processed`, `Item Delivered`):**  
  Included as-is (`source_systems = A`). Missing attributes (e.g., `user_id`, `notes`) are blank.
- **Log B Unmatched (`PaymentCheck`, `Quality Check`):**  
  Included as-is (`source_systems = B`). Missing attributes (e.g., `event_type`) are blank.  
  - **`PaymentCheck`** (10:02:05): Not merged with `Payment Processed` due to timestamp mismatch.  
  - **`Quality Check`** (10:03:00): No corresponding Log A event (closest Log A event was 5:00 earlier).

#### **4. Attribute Integration**
- **Merged Events:** All attributes from both logs are included.  
  Example: `Order Received` + `OrderReceived`  Combines `event_type` (Log A) and `event_name`, `user_id`, etc. (Log B).  
- **Timestamp Conflicts:** Log A timestamps prioritized. Log B timestamps noted in `notes` if they differ (e.g., `PaymentCheck` timestamp included in `notes`).  
- **Naming Conventions:** Both `event_type` (Log A) and `event_name` (Log B) retained for merged events to preserve context.

#### **5. Chronological Order**
Events sorted by timestamp (ascending) using Log A timestamps as the primary reference. Unmatched events retain their original timestamps.

### Key Insights
- **Timestamp Offset Handling:** Log B timestamps were consistently 1–2 seconds earlier than Log A (e.g., `OrderReceived` at 10:00:02 vs. `Order Received` at 10:00:00). This suggests Log B events may be recorded at the *start* of processing, while Log A reflects *receipt*.
- **Missing Events:**  
  - Log A’s `Item Delivered` has no Log B counterpart  Log B may lack delivery tracking.  
  - Log B’s `Quality Check` has no Log A equivalent  Log A may skip quality control steps.
- **Tolerance Choice:** A 2-second tolerance balanced precision (avoiding false matches) and flexibility (accounting for system delays). Increasing tolerance to 5 seconds would merge `Payment Processed`/`PaymentCheck`, but this could risk conflating unrelated events.
