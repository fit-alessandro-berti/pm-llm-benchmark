Below is a structured, BPMN-like textual representation of the process as described in the interviews. This representation is designed so that a process modeler could translate it directly into a BPMN diagram.

**Pools & Lanes**:  
- **Accounts Payable (AP)**: Includes AP Clerk (Mary) and AP Supervisor (Rita)  
- **Purchasing (Dan)**  
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** (Intervening role; no direct approvals)  
- **Supplier** (External entity)

**Data Objects**:  
- **Invoice (received via email)**  
- **Purchase Order (PO)**  
- **Confirmation Email**  
- **Revised Invoice (if requested)**  
- **Approval Notification**

**Process Start (Accounts Payable):**  
1. **Start Event**: Invoice Received from Supplier (Email)  
2. **Task (AP Clerk)**: Check Invoice for Valid PO  
   - **Decision Gateway**: Does the Invoice have a valid PO Number?  
     - **If NO**:  
       3a. **Task (AP Clerk)**: Return Invoice to Supplier requesting PO or additional details  
       3b. **End Event**: Await corrected invoice from Supplier (Process restarts at Step 1 when new invoice arrives)  
     - **If YES**:  
       4. **Task (AP Clerk)**: Log Invoice in Accounting System (Data Object: Invoice recorded)  
       5. **Task (AP Clerk)**: Forward Invoice and PO to Purchasing for Confirmation

**Purchasing Confirmation:**  
6. **Task (Purchasing Officer)**: Verify Invoice Against PO  
   - Compare quantities, prices, terms.  
   - **Decision Gateway**: Is the Invoice accurate and aligned with the PO?  
     - **If NO**:  
       - Variation A: If minor discrepancy (e.g., missing info), Purchasing requests AP to hold invoice until Supplier provides correction.  
         7a. **Task (Purchasing Officer)**: Notify AP to hold invoice and/or request corrected invoice from Supplier (via AP or directly).  
         7b. **Task (Supplier Relationship Manager, as needed)**: Contact Supplier to resolve discrepancy (e.g., request Revised Invoice).  
         - Once resolved (Supplier sends Revised Invoice with correct info):  
           - Invoice re-enters process at Step 1 with updated details, or is resumed at AP matching (Step 9) if only an update was needed.  
       - Variation B: If persistent or unclear discrepancy:  
         7c. **Task (AP Clerk)**: Escalate to AP Supervisor  
         7d. **Task (AP Supervisor)**: Investigate and coordinate with Supplier or Department Heads to resolve issues.  
         - After resolution, return to normal flow.  
     - **If YES**:  
       8. **Task (Purchasing Officer)**: Send Confirmation Email back to AP

**Invoice Matching & Manager Approval (Accounts Payable):**  
9. **Task (AP Clerk)**: Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in the Accounting System  
   - **Decision Gateway**: Does the Invoice perfectly match the PO details now?  
     - **If NO (Still a Discrepancy)**:  
       10a. **Task (AP Clerk)**: Email Purchasing for Clarification  
         - If still unresolved, escalate to AP Supervisor as per Variation B above.  
         - After resolution, return to this matching step.  
     - **If YES**:  
       11. **Task (AP Clerk)**: Send Invoice for Manager Approval  
         - System triggers Approval Notification to Manager

**Manager Approval:**  
12. **Task (Department Manager)**: Review Invoice, PO, and Confirmation  
   - **Decision Gateway**: Approve Invoice?  
     - **If NO (Reject or Hold)**:  
       13a. **Task (Department Manager)**: Reject or request hold from AP  
       13b. **Task (AP Clerk)**: Investigate or request additional info (may involve AP Supervisor or Supplier Relationship Manager if needed)  
       - After issue resolution, return to Step 11 for manager approval attempt again.  
     - **If YES**:  
       14. **Task (Department Manager)**: Approve Invoice

**Payment Scheduling:**  
15. **Task (AP Clerk)**: Schedule the Invoice for Payment in Next Payment Run

**End Event**: Invoice Approved and Payment Scheduled.

**Notes/Uncertainties/Variations:**  
- If no PO is present initially, the process cannot proceed to Purchasing confirmation. The invoice is returned to the Supplier for correction.  
- If there are unresolved discrepancies after Purchasing review, AP may escalate to the AP Supervisor who may coordinate with the Supplier Relationship Manager to rectify terms, pricing, or missing references.  
- In some cases, services might not have a formal PO. The AP Supervisor works with department heads to create a retrospective PO or decide on rejection.  
- The process description assumes that once discrepancies are resolved, the invoice flows back into the main sequence (re-verification in Purchasing or AP matching) before proceeding to Manager Approval.  
- The trigger for Manager Approval is the system notification sent after the invoice has been confirmed and matched successfully.  
- The Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) is involved only when supplier input is needed to resolve discrepancies. She does not perform approvals or system tasks directly.

This textual model can be directly transformed into a BPMN diagram with pools, lanes, tasks, gateways, and arrows indicating the sequence flows. It incorporates data objects (invoices, POs), roles (AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Manager, etc.), decision points, exceptions (discrepancies, missing PO), and rework loops (invoice returned for correction, escalation to AP Supervisor).
