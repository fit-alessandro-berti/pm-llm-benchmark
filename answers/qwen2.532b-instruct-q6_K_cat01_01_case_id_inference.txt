To group the events into distinct "cases," we need to identify sequences of activities that logically belong together based on shared attributes like `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and a coherent progression through hospital processes (e.g., registration, triage, consultations, treatments, discharge). Here's how these events can be grouped:

### Case 1: Patient Age = 45, Gender = M
- **Event 1:** Register patient (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z)
- **Event 4:** Initial triage (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z)
- **Event 7:** X-ray imaging (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z)
- **Event 12:** Doctor consultation (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, misattributed due to similar timing, should be corrected based on triage_code or other identifiers)
- **Event 13:** Doctor consultation (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z) - Corrected
- **Event 15:** Patient discharged (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z)

### Case 2: Patient Age = 62, Gender = F
- **Event 2:** Register patient (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z)
- **Event 5:** Initial triage (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z)
- **Event 8:** Lab test requested (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z)
- **Event 10:** Lab test completed (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z)
- **Event 11:** Doctor consultation (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z) - Corrected
- **Event 14:** Prescription created (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z)
- **Event 17:** Patient discharged (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z)

### Case 3: Patient Age = 28, Gender = M
- **Event 3:** Register patient (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z)
- **Event 6:** Doctor consultation (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z)
- **Event 9:** Surgery preparation (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z)
- **Event 13:** Surgery performed (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z) - Corrected
- **Event 16:** Recovery room (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z)
- **Event 18:** Patient discharged (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z)

### Summary
Each case is defined by a sequence of events that logically follow from each other and share the same patient attributes. Events are ordered based on timestamps, department transitions, and activity types to infer the correct grouping:

**Case 1:** Patient Age = 45, Gender = M  
**Case 2:** Patient Age = 62, Gender = F  
**Case 3:** Patient Age = 28, Gender = M

By identifying these sequences, we can infer that each case corresponds to a distinct patient journey through the hospital.
