### Analysis and Renaming Approach

1. **Identified Recurring Activities**:
   - **Verify Documents**: Appears twice in C001 and twice in C003. In C001, the first is an initial check of identity documents (incomplete), while the second is a re-check after additional uploads. In C003, the first is an initial physical verification, while the second is a re-verification after an account adjustment. It appears once in C002 (initial identity verification), but I've renamed all occurrences for consistency in disambiguation.
   - **Call Customer**: Appears twice in C002. The first is to clarify an account discrepancy, while the second is a follow-up to confirm adjustments. It appears once in C001 (to request missing documents) and once in C003 (to request the customer return to the branch), but I've renamed all for consistency.
   - Other activities (e.g., Initiate Request, Approve Request, Adjust Account, Submit Additional) do not recur within any single case, so they are left unchanged. However, note that Initiate Request has contextual differences across cases (online vs. branch), but per the task focus on within-case recurrences, it remains as is.

2. **Renaming Strategy**:
   - Renames are based on the **Additional Context** column, which provides specific details about the purpose, timing, or nature of the activity (e.g., reason for call, type of verification, what triggers the re-occurrence).
   - New names are descriptive, incorporating key contextual clues to disambiguate roles in the process flow (e.g., purpose of call, whether verification is initial/physical/re-check).
   - This ensures that even if the original name was the same, the renamed activities highlight differences (e.g., no two "Call Customer" events have the same name, reflecting their unique contexts).

3. **Revised Event Log**:
   - Only the "Activity" column is updated for the identified recurring activities. Other columns remain unchanged.

4. **Justification of Naming Choices**:
   - **Verify Documents Renames**:
     - "Check Identity Documents" (C001 first): Reflects the initial focus on identity checks (clue: "Agent checks identity documents").
     - "Re-check Documents with ID Scan" (C001 second): Highlights the re-check triggered by new uploads (clue: "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided").
     - "Verify Identity" (C002): Emphasizes the standalone identity focus without re-check (clue: "Identity verification").
     - "Physical ID Verification" (C003 first): Captures the in-person nature (clue: "Physical verification of ID"; resource is BranchOfficer).
     - "Re-verify Documents After Adjustment" (C003 second): Indicates re-verification post-adjustment (clue: "Re-verify docs after account adjustment").
     - These names disambiguate by incorporating triggers (e.g., initial vs. re-check, physical vs. implied online) and position in the flow, ensuring contextual differences are clear within cases.

   - **Call Customer Renames**:
     - "Call to Request Missing Documents" (C001): Specifies the purpose of requesting docs due to incomplete verification (clue: "agent calls to request missing docs").
     - "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy" (C002 first): Reflects clarification of a discrepancy (clue: "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy").
     - "Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments" (C002 second): Highlights the follow-up nature for confirmation post-adjustment (clue: "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made").
     - "Call to Have Customer Return" (C003): Indicates the goal of recalling the customer to the branch (clue: "Officer calls to have them return").
     - These names differentiate by purpose (e.g., request docs vs. clarify vs. confirm vs. return), drawing directly from contextual clues to avoid ambiguity within cases like C002.

This approach ensures the activity names now uniquely represent their roles, improving process clarity without altering the underlying log structure.
