I can help you identify potential root causes for performance issues in your process based on the data provided. 

Here's a breakdown of observations and potential root causes:

**1. Rejection Loops:**

* **Frequent Rejections:** Notice the numerous process variants involving repeated rejections by Administration, Pre-Approver, Supervisor, or Budget Owner.  These loops significantly increase the time to completion ("performance").
    * **Potential Root Cause:**  Issues with initial application completeness, unclear requirements, inconsistent decision-making, lack of communication, or inadequate training contributing to rejections.

**2. Complex Approval Paths:**

* **Variants with Multiple Approvers:**  Some variants involve approvals from multiple parties (Administration, Budget Owner, Supervisor). This adds complexity and potential delays.
    * **Potential Root Cause:** 
        *  Overly complex approval hierarchies might be necessary but could be streamlined.
        *  Lack of clear delegation of authority could lead to bottlenecks.

**3. Missing Data Points:**

* **"REJECTED by MISSING":**  Occurrences of "REJECTED by MISSING" indicate potential data gaps or process breakdowns.
    * **Potential Root Cause:**  Incomplete data required for approval, missing system information, or unclear process steps.

**4. High-Performance, Low-Frequency Variants:**

*  Variants with high performance but low frequency (e.g.,  "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled") might not be indicative of overall process efficiency.
    * **Potential Root Cause:**  These are likely simpler cases, while the majority of processes have more complexities.

**5. "SAVED" Status:**

*  The "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" variant with zero performance suggests that applications are being saved without progressing.
    * **Potential Root Cause:**  Users might be abandoning applications, indicating potential issues with usability or complexity.


**Recommendations:**

1. **Analyze Rejection Patterns:**  Investigate the reasons behind rejections in each variant. Look for common themes, user feedback, and potential areas for improvement in application requirements.

2. **Map the Approval Flows:**  Visually map out the approval paths for each variant. Identify potential bottlenecks, redundancies, or areas where delegation could be improved.
3. **Address Missing Data Issues:**  Investigate the causes of "REJECTED by MISSING" and ensure all necessary data points are captured accurately and consistently.
4. **Simplify the User Experience:**  Review the application process for usability issues. Make it clear, concise, and easy for users to complete. 


Remember, this analysis is based on the provided data.  
A deeper dive into the system logs, user feedback, and process documentation will provide more specific insights into the root causes of performance issues.
