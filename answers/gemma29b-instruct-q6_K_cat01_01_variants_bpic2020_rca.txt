Based on the provided data, here are some potential root causes for performance issues in the process:

* **High Rejection Rates:**  Several paths show frequent rejections at various stages (SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER). This suggests potential issues with:
    * **Inconsistent criteria:** Decision-makers may not be applying approval criteria consistently.
    * **Lack of clarity:** Employees might not fully understand the requirements for approval.
    * **Communication breakdowns:** Issues with communication between parties could lead to misunderstandings and rejections.
* **Lengthy Processing Times:** Some paths involve multiple submissions and rejections, significantly extending the overall processing time. This could be due to:
    * **Redundant steps:**  The process might have unnecessary steps that add time without value.
    * **Slow response times:** Decision-makers might be taking too long to review and approve/reject requests.
* **Missing Data:** The presence of "REJECTED by MISSING" indicates a potential issue with data completeness or availability. This could lead to delays and rejections.


To pinpoint the exact root causes, further analysis is needed, including:

* **Analyzing rejection reasons:** Understanding why each request is rejected can reveal specific pain points.
* **Mapping process bottlenecks:** Identifying steps where delays occur can highlight areas for improvement.
* **Gathering feedback from stakeholders:**  Understanding the perspectives of employees, supervisors, and administrators can provide valuable insights.
