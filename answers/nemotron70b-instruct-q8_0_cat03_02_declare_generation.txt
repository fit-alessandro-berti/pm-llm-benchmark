Below is an example of a DECLARE model for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process, expressed as a Python dictionary. This P2P process involves the following activities:

1. **Create Purchase Order (CPO)**
2. **Send Purchase Order (SPO)**
3. **Receive Goods (RG)**
4. **Receive Invoice (RI)**
5. **Pay Invoice (PI)**
6. **Verify Goods (VG)**

For simplicity, the support and confidence for all rules are set to 1.0 as per your request, indicating that these constraints are fully supported by the process data and are considered with full confidence in the model.

```python
declare_model_p2p = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Goods': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Pay Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Verify Goods': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'absence': {},  # No activities are constrained to never happen
    'exactly_one': {},  # No activities are constrained to happen exactly once in the whole process
    'init': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },  # Process always starts with creating a purchase order
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },  # If SPO then RG, If RI then PI
    'coexistence': {},  # Not explicitly defined but could be inferred from responded existence in this example
    'response': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Verify Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },  # If CPO then eventually SPO, If RG then eventually VG
    'precedence': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Verify Goods', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}  # Corrected to reflect a plausible constraint
    },  # If RG then SPO has happened before, Adjusted VG and PI for logical flow
    'succession': {},  # Implicit through response and precedence constraints defined
    'altresponse': {}, 
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},
    'chainresponse': {
        ('Receive Goods', 'Verify Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },  # RG directly followed by VG
    'chainprecedence': {}, 
    'chainsuccession': {}, 
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}  # SPO and PI should not both occur without RG and RI in between
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        ('Verify Goods', 'Create Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}  # VG should not be directly followed by CPO
    },
    'nonchainsuccession': {} 
}
```

**Key Assumptions and Notes for the Model:**

- **Process Initiation:** The process always starts with `Create Purchase Order`.
- **Logical Flow:** After sending a purchase order, goods are received. Goods receipt triggers verification, and upon successful verification (implied, not explicitly modeled as an outcome), the invoice can be paid.
- **Payment Logic Clarification:** For a more realistic model, you might want to add constraints or activities related to invoice receipt before payment (`RI` before `PI`). This example simplifies the payment trigger but maintains logical flow integrity by emphasizing verification after goods receipt.
- **Non-Coexistence and Non-Succession Constraints:** These are examples. In real scenarios, analyze your process closely to determine if such constraints apply (e.g., can `SPO` and `PI` not co-occur without intermediate steps?).

**To Use This Model with pm4py:**

1. Ensure you have `pm4py` installed in your Python environment.
2. Copy the provided dictionary into a Python script or an interactive environment.
3. Apply various `pm4py` functions for analysis, conformance checking, or model enhancement based on your process mining goals.

Remember, this is a hypothetical example. Real-world DECLARE models should be derived from actual process data to accurately reflect the underlying business processes.
