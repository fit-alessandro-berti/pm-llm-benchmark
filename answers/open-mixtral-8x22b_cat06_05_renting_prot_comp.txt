Based on the provided process variants for the protected and unprotected groups, here are the main differences:

1. Rejection rate: The protected group has a higher rejection rate in the initial stages of the process compared to the unprotected group. There are more instances of rejection after viewing the property or after an extensive screening in the protected group.
2. Extensive screening: The protected group undergoes extensive screening more frequently than the unprotected group. This could indicate a potential bias in the screening process or requirements.
3. Tenant cancellation: Both groups have similar frequencies of tenant cancellations, but the performance times for the protected group are generally higher than those for the unprotected group. This suggests that the protected group may be staying in the properties for longer periods before canceling.
4. Missed rent payments and evictions: The protected group has instances of missed rent payments and evictions, while the unprotected group does not. This could indicate a potential financial disadvantage or hardship faced by the protected group.
5. Frequency and performance: The frequency of process variants and their performance times are generally lower for the protected group compared to the unprotected group. This could suggest that the protected group faces more barriers or delays in completing the process.

Overall, the main differences between the two groups appear to be related to rejection rates, screening processes, tenant cancellations, and financial factors. These differences may be indicative of potential biases or disparities in the treatment of the protected group.
