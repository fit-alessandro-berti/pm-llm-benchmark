To achieve the desired filtering of cases in DuckDB, we can use a combination of SQL subqueries and the `JOIN` operation. The approach involves the following steps:

1. Calculate the count of events for each `case_id`.
2. Filter out `case_id`s that have more than six events.
3. Return all events belonging to the remaining `case_id`s.

Here's how you can construct the SQL query in DuckDB to accomplish this task:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)

SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    case_event_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
ORDER BY
    e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Subquery (`case_event_counts`):**
   - We start by creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `case_event_counts`.
   - In this CTE, we select `case_id` and calculate the total number of events for each `case_id` using `COUNT(*)`.
   - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the events by `case_id`.
   - The `HAVING` clause filters out any `case_id` with more than six events (`COUNT(*) <= 6`).

2. **Main Query:**
   - We select all columns from the `event_log` table, aliased as `e`.
   - We perform an `INNER JOIN` with the `case_event_counts` CTE on `case_id` to retain only those events whose `case_id` has six or fewer events.
   - The `ORDER BY` clause organizes the results by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain chronological order within each case.

This query efficiently filters out any process instances (cases) with more than six events and retrieves the complete set of events for those cases with six or fewer events.
