The process described here appears to be a system for managing fines, probably in the domain of traffic violations or similar offenses. The general flow is as follows:

1. A fine is created (Create Fine).
2. The fine is then sent (Send Fine).
3. A notification of the fine is inserted into the system (Insert Fine Notification).
4. A penalty is added to the fine (Add penalty). 
5. The fine and penalty can then either be paid (Payment) directly or sent to a credit collection agency (Send for Credit Collection). 
   
Additional steps can occur in certain situations:

If an offender decides to appeal the fine, this is recorded in the system via Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture. The appeal is then sent to the prefecture (Send Appeal to Prefecture), and the system later receives the result of the appeal from the prefecture (Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture). The result is then notified to the offender (Notify Result Appeal to Offender). 

Based on the result, there can be different outcomes such as additional penalty, payment of fine, sending for credit collection, or even sending for an appeal to the judge (Appeal to Judge).

Each flux in this process is characterized by two main metrics: frequency, which represents how often that step occurs, and performance, which seems to measure some quality or effectiveness aspect of that step (although what exactly this represents isn't spelled out in the provided data).
