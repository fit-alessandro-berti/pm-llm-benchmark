Here is a Python code example that implements a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process in pm4py:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities in the process
request_purchase = Transition(label="Request Purchase")
create_po = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
send_po = Transition(label="Send Purchase Order to Supplier")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
receive_invoice = Transition(label="Receive Invoice")
review_invoice = Transition(label="Review Invoice")
approve_invoice = Transition(label="Approve Invoice")
pay_invoice = Transition(label="Pay Invoice")
send_acknowledgement = Transition(label="Send Acknowledgement to Supplier")
archive_po = Transition(label="Archive Purchase Order")

# Define silent transitions
skip_1 = SilentTransition()
skip_2 = SilentTransition()

# Define choice between reviewing and paying invoice
review_or_pay = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[review_invoice, pay_invoice])

# Define loop between receiving goods and receiving invoice
receive_goods_invoice_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[receive_goods, receive_invoice])

# Define partial order for the main process
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    request_purchase,
    create_po,
    send_po,
    receive_goods_invoice_loop,
    review_or_pay,
    approve_invoice,
    pay_invoice,
    send_acknowledgement,
    archive_po
])

# Define the order of execution
root.order.add_edge(request_purchase, create_po)
root.order.add_edge(create_po, send_po)
root.order.add_edge(send_po, receive_goods_invoice_loop)
root.order.add_edge(receive_goods_invoice_loop, review_or_pay)
root.order.add_edge(review_or_pay, approve_invoice)
root.order.add_edge(approve_invoice, pay_invoice)
root.order.add_edge(pay_invoice, send_acknowledgement)
root.order.add_edge(send_acknowledgement, archive_po)

# Print the model
print(root)
```
This code defines a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process, which includes the following activities:

1. Request Purchase
2. Create Purchase Order
3. Send Purchase Order to Supplier
4. Receive Goods
5. Receive Invoice
6. Review Invoice
7. Approve Invoice
8. Pay Invoice
9. Send Acknowledgement to Supplier
10. Archive Purchase Order

The model includes a
