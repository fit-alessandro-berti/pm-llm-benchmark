Here is an example of Python code that implements a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using pm4py:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
create_purchase_request = Transition(label="Create Purchase Request")
approve_purchase_request = Transition(label="Approve Purchase Request")
create_purchase_order = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
send_purchase_order = Transition(label="Send Purchase Order")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
inspect_goods = Transition(label="Inspect Goods")
pay_invoice = Transition(label="Pay Invoice")
reject_goods = Transition(label="Reject Goods")

# Define silent transitions
silent_transition1 = SilentTransition()
silent_transition2 = SilentTransition()

# Define choices
approve_or_reject_purchase_request = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[approve_purchase_request, silent_transition1])
pay_or_reject_invoice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[pay_invoice, reject_goods])

# Define loops
receive_and_inspect_goods = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[receive_goods, inspect_goods])

# Define partial orders
po1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[create_purchase_request, approve_or_reject_purchase_request, create_purchase_order])
po1.order.add_edge(create_purchase_request, approve_or_reject_purchase_request)
po1.order.add_edge(approve_or_reject_purchase_request, create_purchase_order)

po2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[send_purchase_order, receive_and_inspect_goods, pay_or_reject_invoice])
po2.order.add_edge(send_purchase_order, receive_and_inspect_goods)
po2.order.add_edge(receive_and_inspect_goods, pay_or_reject_invoice)

# Define root node
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[po1, po2])
root.order.add_edge(po1, po2)

print(root)
```
This code defines a POWL model for a Purchase-to-Pay process that includes the following activities:

1. Create Purchase Request
2. Approve Purchase Request
3. Create Purchase Order
4. Send Purchase Order
5. Receive Goods
6. Inspect Goods
7. Pay Invoice
8. Reject Goods

The process is modeled using a combination of choices, loops, and partial orders. The choices allow for different paths to be taken based on certain conditions, while the loops represent repetitive tasks. The partial orders define the order in which activities must be executed.

Note that this is just one possible way to model a Purchase-to-Pay process using pm4py, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and complexity of the process.
