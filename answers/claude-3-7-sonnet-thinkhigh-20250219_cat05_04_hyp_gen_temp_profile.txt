# Temporal Profile Analysis: Insurance Claims Processing Anomalies

## Identified Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

After examining the temporal profile model, I've identified several concerning patterns that suggest process inefficiencies:

### 1. Suspiciously Consistent Approval Timing (RP)
The average time between claim receipt and approval is approximately 25 hours (90,000 seconds) with a standard deviation of only 1 hour. This unusually small deviation suggests an artificial constraint rather than a natural process variance.

### 2. Excessive Notification Delay (PN)
There's an alarming 7-day average wait time between claim approval and customer notification, with a large 2-day standard deviation. This extended delay appears disconnected from good customer service practices.

### 3. Premature Claim Closure (AC)
Claims are being closed, on average, just 2 hours after adjuster assignment. This timing suggests claims may be closed without proper evaluation or approval steps occurring in between.

### 4. Unrealistic Evaluation-to-Notification Speed (EN)
The 5-minute average transition from evaluation to customer notification with only a 1-minute standard deviation indicates potentially automated or rushed notification without proper review.

### 5. Process Flow Gaps
The temporal profile lacks direct relationships between certain sequential activities (e.g., AE, EP), suggesting inconsistent process execution or data recording.

## Hypotheses for Anomalies

### For RP (Suspiciously Consistent Approval Timing):
1. **Scheduled Batch Processing**: Claims may be approved in daily batches at fixed times regardless of when they were received.
2. **Performance Metric Manipulation**: Staff might be backdating approvals to meet service level agreements.
3. **Artificial Timer System**: The system might enforce a minimum waiting period before allowing approval.
4. **Policy-Driven Timeline**: Company policy might dictate that approvals must happen within a specific window, creating artificial consistency.

### For PN (Excessive Notification Delay):
1. **Resource Bottleneck**: Insufficient staff handling notifications leading to backlogs.
2. **Financial Management Strategy**: Intentional delay to manage cash flow before disbursement.
3. **Weekly Batch Processing**: Notifications might be processed only once per week.
4. **System Integration Issues**: Disconnect between approval and notification systems.
5. **Secondary Review Process**: Hidden additional review steps might occur between approval and notification.

### For AC (Premature Claim Closure):
1. **Skip-Process Protocol**: Some claims might follow a streamlined path bypassing standard evaluation.
2. **Performance Incentives**: Adjusters might be rushing closures to improve productivity metrics.
3. **Claim Abandonment**: Claims could be closed when customers fail to provide additional required information.
4. **Auto-Rejection Process**: Certain claim types might be automatically rejected after initial review.
5. **Data Entry Errors**: Timestamps might be incorrectly recorded, creating the appearance of rushed processing.

### For EN (Unrealistic Notification Speed):
1. **Automated Notification System**: Notifications might be automatically triggered immediately after evaluation.
2. **Timestamp Discrepancy**: The system might record the notification at creation rather than delivery.
3. **Parallel Processing**: Notification preparation might begin during evaluation rather than after.
4. **Template-Based Communication**: Use of pre-approved templates might eliminate review time between evaluation and notification.

## SQL Verification Approaches

### Verify Suspicious Approval Timing (RP):

```sql
-- Check if approvals happen at consistent times of day (batch processing)
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM p.timestamp) AS approval_hour,
    COUNT(*) as approval_count
FROM claim_events p
WHERE p.activity = 'P'
GROUP BY approval_hour
ORDER BY approval_count DESC;

-- Identify claims with unnaturally consistent timing across different complexities
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp))) AS avg_seconds,
    STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp))) AS stddev_seconds
FROM claim_events r
JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON r.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE r.activity = 'R' AND p.activity = 'P'
GROUP BY c.claim_type, 
    CASE WHEN c.claim_amount < 1000 THEN 'Small'
         WHEN c.claim_amount < 5000 THEN 'Medium'
         ELSE 'Large' END
HAVING STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp))) < 4000;
```

### Verify Excessive Notification Delay (PN):

```sql
-- Check if notification delays correlate with claim amounts
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN c.claim_amount < 1000 THEN 'Small (<$1000)'
        WHEN c.claim_amount BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000 THEN 'Medium ($1000-$5000)'
        ELSE 'Large (>$5000)'
    END AS claim_size,
    COUNT(*) AS claim_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)))/86400 AS avg_days_to_notify
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY claim_size
ORDER BY avg_days_to_notify DESC;

-- Identify evidence of batch notification processing
SELECT 
    DATE(n.timestamp) AS notification_date,
    COUNT(*) AS notification_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.claim_id) AS distinct_claims
FROM claim_events n
JOIN claim_events p ON n.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
WHERE n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY notification_date
ORDER BY notification_count DESC;
```

### Verify Premature Claim Closure (AC):

```sql
-- Identify claims closed without proper evaluation or approval
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close.timestamp - assign.timestamp))/3600 AS hours_to_close,
    CASE WHEN e.event_id IS NULL THEN 'Missing' ELSE 'Present' END AS evaluation,
    CASE WHEN p.event_id IS NULL THEN 'Missing' ELSE 'Present' END AS approval
FROM claim_events assign
JOIN claim_events close ON assign.claim_id = close.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON assign.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON assign.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN claim_events p ON assign.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
WHERE assign.activity = 'A' AND close.activity = 'C'
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close.timestamp - assign.timestamp)) < 7200
ORDER BY hours_to_close;

-- Check if specific adjusters frequently close claims prematurely
SELECT 
    assign.resource AS adjuster,
    COUNT(*) AS quick_closure_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close.timestamp - assign.timestamp)))/60 AS avg_minutes_to_close
FROM claim_events assign
JOIN claim_events close ON assign.claim_id = close.claim_id
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON assign.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN claim_events p ON assign.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
WHERE assign.activity = 'A' AND close.activity = 'C'
  AND (e.event_id IS NULL OR p.event_id IS NULL)
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close.timestamp - assign.timestamp)) < 7200
GROUP BY assign.resource
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY quick_closure_count DESC;
```

### Verify Unrealistic Evaluation-to-Notification Speed (EN):

```sql
-- Check if notifications are sent without proper approval
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS seconds_between_eval_notify,
    CASE WHEN p.event_id IS NULL THEN 'Missing' ELSE 'Present' END AS approval_status
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN claim_events p ON e.claim_id = p.claim_id 
    AND p.activity = 'P' 
    AND p.timestamp BETWEEN e.timestamp AND n.timestamp
WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 300
ORDER BY seconds_between_eval_notify;

-- Identify if the same resource performs both evaluation and notification
SELECT 
    e.resource,
    COUNT(*) AS instances,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp))) AS avg_seconds
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
  AND e.resource = n.resource
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 300
GROUP BY e.resource
ORDER BY instances DESC;
```

### Verify Process Flow Gaps:

```sql
-- Identify claims with incomplete or out-of-sequence processing
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    STRING_AGG(ce.activity, '->' ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS activity_sequence
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type
HAVING STRING_AGG(ce.activity, '' ORDER BY ce.timestamp) NOT LIKE '%R%A%E%P%N%C%';

-- Analyze which activities are most commonly skipped by claim type
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_evaluation,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p.event_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_approval,
    SUM(CASE WHEN n.event_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_notification,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::NUMERIC / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) AS pct_missing_evaluation
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events r ON c.claim_id = r.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R'
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN claim_events p ON c.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
LEFT JOIN claim_events n ON c.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY pct_missing_evaluation DESC;
```
