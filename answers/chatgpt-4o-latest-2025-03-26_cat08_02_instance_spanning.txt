**Comprehensive Strategy for Optimizing Fulfillment Under Instance-Spanning Constraints Using Process Mining**

---

### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

To improve fulfillment performance, it's critical first to explicitly identify and quantify how each instance-spanning constraint affects the order lifecycle. Process mining techniques—such as performance analysis, conformance checking, bottleneck detection, and instance-aware metrics—can be employed over the event log to uncover the effects of cross-instance dependencies.

#### A. Constraint Identification and Metrics

**A.1 Shared Cold-Packing Stations Constraint**

- **Problem**: Scarcity of cold-packing stations (e.g., only 5 available) creates competition among orders requiring cold-packing.
- **Detection Method**:
  - Filter the event log for `Packing` steps where “Requires Cold Packing” is TRUE.
  - Analyze queuing delays prior to cold-packing start (calculated as the interval between preceding activity complete and cold-packing start).
  - Use resource utilization analysis to identify contention levels (e.g., resource occupancy exceeding 80% for prolonged periods).
- **Metrics to Evaluate Impact**:
  - Median and 95th percentile waiting time for cold-packing.
  - Utilization rate per cold-packing station.
  - Number of queuing instances per hour/day.
  - Average delay impact per order due to cold-packing.

**A.2 Batching for Shipping**

- **Problem**: Orders wait at the end of quality check or just prior to shipping label generation for batch aggregation.
- **Detection Method**:
  - Identify timestamps of `Shipping Label Generation` for grouped orders assigned to the same batch (e.g., “System (Batch B1)”).
  - Check the start and complete time of `Quality Check` for those cases to determine the spread.
- **Metrics to Evaluate Impact**:
  - Average waiting time between `Quality Check COMPLETE` and `Shipping Label Generation START`, grouped by region and batch.
  - Time difference between the first and last order’s QC completion in a batch.
  - Batch fill-rate efficiency (did they proceed with underfilled batches due to timeout?).
  - Number of delayed shipments due to batch incomplete.

**A.3 Priority Order Handling (Express Preemption)**

- **Problem**: Express orders can interrupt standard orders’ access to shared resources like packing stations.
- **Detection Method**:
  - Detect when an express order’s `START` activity timestamp coincides closely with a standard order’s `COMPLETE` timestamp at the same station.
  - Analyze resource re-assignment duration between standard and express tasks at the same station.
- **Metrics to Evaluate Impact**:
  - Frequency and duration of express preemption events.
  - Average delay of standard orders after losing resource to express order.
  - Impact on standard order turnaround times in presence/absence of express competition.

**A.4 Hazardous Materials Limit**

- **Problem**: A regulatory cap of 10 orders with hazardous materials concurrently active in `Packing` or `Quality Check`.
- **Detection Method**:
  - Create time-based snapshots (e.g., 1-minute intervals) of how many hazardous material orders are in either of the two stages simultaneously.
  - Match patterns of orders waiting to start these steps due to active count over limit.
- **Metrics to Evaluate Impact**:
  - Average number of times the limit is reached per day.
  - Delay in hazardous orders waiting for a slot in packing or QC.
  - Overall throughput impact on hazardous vs. standard orders.

#### B. Differentiating Within vs. Between-Instance Waiting

- **Within-instance waiting**: Use long activity duration to detect inefficiencies in single case processing (e.g., prolonged packing due to defective items).
- **Between-instance waiting**:
  - Waiting before activity start (e.g., cold packing starts late due to resource busy with another order).
  - Event correlation is necessary to detect shared resource contention.
  - Use timestamp gaps between sequential activities and correlate with resource occupancy logs.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

Understanding how these constraints interact is vital as addressing one in isolation may exacerbate others.

#### A. Express Orders Needing Cold-Packing

- **Impact**: Preemption by express orders on cold-packing can:
  - Block standard cold-pack-required orders, increasing their queue.
  - Lead to starvation in cold-pack queue for non-express orders during peak express influx.
  
#### B. Batching and Hazardous Material Limits

- **Impact**: If several hazardous orders are destined to the same region and batching is delayed:
  - They might cause persistent congestion in the QC/packing limit.
  - System might hold multiple hazardous orders almost completed but delayed due to regulatory cap, reducing throughput.
  
#### C. Cold-Packing and Batching Trade-offs

- Orders requiring cold-packing and belonging to same region but arriving at different times might:
  - Cause extended wait times in shipping to form batch.
  - Meanwhile, buffer space at cold-packing may stay occupied pre-shipment.

#### Importance of Modeling Interactions:

- Modeling these interactions clarifies:
  - Compound bottlenecks—e.g., cold-packing delays cascading into batching delays.
  - Risk of resource starvation for specific categories of orders.
  - How orders hold onto constrained resources longer than needed (due to downstream delays), worsening contention.
  
Understanding interactions enables trade-off-aware optimization: e.g., adjusting batching policy might help hazardous material throughput if it reduces occupancy time per order.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Dynamic Slot Reservation for Cold-Packing Stations

- **Constraint(s) Addressed**: Shared Cold-Packing, Priority Orders
- **Proposed Change**:
  - Implement a dynamic slot scheduling mechanism where a certain number of cold-packing slots are always available for express orders.
  - Use predictive modeling (via process mining logs) to forecast express order arrival rates by time-of-day/day-of-week.
- **Data/Analysis Utilized**:
  - Analyze three months of cold-packing usage, peak times, and express order patterns to calculate expected express load.
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - Minimized preemption events as express orders are directly allocated reserved slots.
  - Reduced average waiting time for both express and standard orders as resource contention is smoothed.

#### Strategy 2: Smart, Predictive Shipping Batch Formation

- **Constraint(s) Addressed**: Shipping Batching, Hazardous Material Limit Interaction
- **Proposed Change**:
  - Utilize historical data to predict likelihood of similar orders arriving within a timeframe (e.g., to a given region).
  - Dynamically form partial batches when waiting time exceeds SLA thresholds or hazardous material congestion is detected.
- **Data/Analysis Utilized**:
  - Mining historic batch sizes and inter-arrival times of orders to regions.
  - Break-even analysis to determine when to dispatch a smaller batch vs. wait.
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - Reduction in post-QC wait times.
  - Better flow of hazardous materials orders stuck due to batching blockage.
  - Enhanced SLA adherence for both standard and express shipping.

#### Strategy 3: Scheduling Policy for Hazardous Order Admission

- **Constraint(s) Addressed**: Regulatory Limit on Hazardous Orders
- **Proposed Change**:
  - Implement a scheduling rule that throttles or staggers the release of hazardous material orders into `Packing` and `QC` based on current active count.
  - A queue monitor prioritizes hazardous orders closer to SLA breach or decomposes non-critical ones.
- **Data/Analysis Utilized**:
  - Use event log to build time series of active hazardous orders.
  - Compute SLA risk scores to prioritize order admission into the critical zone.
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - Full regulatory compliance maintained without throttling throughput unnecessarily.
  - Reduced latency spikes during hazardous material peaks.
  - Improved fairness in processing.

  - Enforce constraint breach detection.

- **What-If Analyses**:
  - Simulate different express order volumes or cold-packing capacities.
  - Vary SLA thresholds to test outcomes.

#### C. KPIs to Measure in Simulation

- Order cycle time (mean, variance).
- Throughput per order type.
- Time spent waiting for:
  - Packing station (standard vs. cold).
  - Shipping batch formation.
- Hazardous order overflow frequency.
