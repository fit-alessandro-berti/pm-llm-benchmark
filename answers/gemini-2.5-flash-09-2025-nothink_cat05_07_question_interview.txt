## Targeted Questions for Interviewee Regarding Property Onboarding Process

Here is a list of targeted, open-ended questions designed to clarify and deepen the conceptual understanding of the described property onboarding process:

### 1. Clarifying Roles, Responsibilities, and Handoffs

1. **Property Coordinator vs. Property Manager Handoff:** What is the precise point of transition (the "handoff criteria") where the Property Coordinator's responsibility ends and the newly assigned Property Manager’s responsibility fully begins? Are there ever periods where both roles are concurrently involved in the same task?
2. **Decision Authority for Manager Assignment:** Who makes the final decision when assigning a Property Manager, and how are the various factors (workload, specialization, track record) weighted against each other in that decision?
3. **External Stakeholder Management:** Who is primarily responsible for coordinating and managing the schedule and output of the external professionals (photographer and certified inspector)? Is this centralized, or is it solely the responsibility of the assigned Property Manager?

### 2. Understanding Decision Criteria and Thresholds

4. **Documentation Deficiency Threshold:** When the Property Coordinator reviews the landlord’s documentation, what specific criteria determine if a document is considered "outdated" or "insufficient," requiring an update? Is there a formal checklist or compliance standard used?
5. **Inspection Failure Protocol:** If the certified inspector finds issues, what is the clear threshold for whether those issues must be addressed *before* marketing begins, versus issues that can be addressed concurrently or after tenant screening?
6. **Tenant Selection Criteria Weighting:** When the Property Manager negotiates lease terms and screens tenants, how are factors like lease length, credit score, employment stability, and previous landlord references weighted against each other, especially when dealing with multiple highly qualified applicants?

### 3. Sequencing and Timing Dependencies

7. **Parallel vs. Sequential Steps:** Which specific activities are strictly sequential (must wait for the previous step to complete) and which are permitted to run in parallel to expedite the process (e.g., can the digital marketing team begin preparing materials before the inspection report is finalized)?
8. **Time Benchmarks:** What is the typical or target Service Level Agreement (SLA) or benchmark time for the critical path activities, specifically: a) Document verification, b) Property Manager assignment, and c) Property listing activation after passing inspection?
9. **Leasing Agent Involvement:** At what point does a dedicated Leasing Agent get involved, if at all, and do they take over the Property Manager’s responsibilities for tenant screening, or do they simply act as support?

### 4. Handling Exceptions and Deviations

10. **Escalation Process for Discrepancies:** If the Financial Analyst finds that the agreed rental price deviates significantly from the company's profitability targets, what is the escalation path, and who has the final authority to either accept the lower price or negotiate further with the landlord?
11. **Handling Custom Lease Clauses:** When a landlord insists on a custom lease clause, what is the specific review and approval process to ensure it complies with local regulations and does not introduce unacceptable risk to the management company? Who within the legal or compliance team handles this review?
12. **Tracking Communication and Status:** Given the reliance on multiple tools (email, CRM, project management), how does the company ensure a single, authoritative source of truth for the current status of a property and the record of all key decisions and communications?

### 5. Quality Checks and Auditing Details

13. **Scope of the Compliance Audit:** Beyond ensuring adherence to fair housing regulations, what other specific compliance items does the Compliance Officer check for during their final review of the lease agreement?
14. **Integration Audit:** Can you elaborate on the types of errors or discrepancies the IT department typically looks for when verifying that the property data has been correctly integrated into the internal systems? What constitutes a "failed" integration audit?
