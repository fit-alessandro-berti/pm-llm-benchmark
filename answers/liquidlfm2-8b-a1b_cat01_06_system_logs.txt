### Explanation and Logic Summary

**Case Identification:**  
Events were grouped into **four major cases** based on logical work sessions reflecting user cognitive and operational flow:  
- **Case C001: Initial Report Drafting & Review** — building the main report in Microsoft Word, incorporating detailed edits and annotations in Adobe Acrobat. Reflects deep document creation and analytical editing.  
- **Case C002: Email Communication** — transition from document creation to collaboration via email. The switch from Word to Chrome marks clear intent to inform/request feedback.  
- **Case C003: Budget Update & Synthesis** — iterative updates in Excel with explicit versioning (“Insert new row for Q2”), grouping related financial work tasks.  
- **Case C004–C007: Closure & Finalization** — includes final edits, saves, cross-app transfers, and email dissemination to conclude work.

**Activity Naming & Standardization:**  
Low-level action verbs were abstracted into meaningful, analyst-readable activity names:  
- “Edit Document: Intro paragraph”  captures specific content focus.  
- “Reply to Email” + “Send Email”  condensed into email communication action.  
- “Insert new row for Q2”  standardized from raw “Insert Q2 figures update” to reflect intent.  
- “Finalize Document & Save”  umbrella term for closure events in Word.  

**Event Attributes:**  
Each event includes **Case ID**, **activity name**, and **Timestamp** aligning with standard process mining event log schema. Timestamps are adjusted to the actual event time, avoiding system clock ease—important for accurate temporal analysis. Additional context (e.g., “Open” + “Reply”) is inferred from sequences where partial data lacks clarity (e.g., “Send” depends on prior “Reply”).

**Narrative Flow:**  
The event log traces a coherent user journey:  
> User begins by deeply editing a Word report, advancing through a detailed draft review and collaborative email preparation. After finalizing financial content in Excel with versioning, the report is finalized, formatted, shared in email, and confirmed sent—culminating in document closure.

This narrative is reinforced by the **sequential yet modular** grouping of related actions as distinct cases, each capturing a meaningful phase of work. The design enables downstream process mining insights such as cycle time, bottlenecks (e.g., prolonged save/send sequences), and case-step correlation for performance analysis.
