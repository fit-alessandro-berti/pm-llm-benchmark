Here is the DuckDB SQL query that solves the specified problem:

```sql
-- Select all columns from the event_log table
SELECT
    t1.*
FROM
    event_log AS t1
WHERE
    -- Filter cases based on the count of events per case_id
    t1.case_id IN (
        SELECT
            case_id
        FROM
            event_log
        GROUP BY
            case_id
        -- Only include case_ids where the total count of events is 6 or less
        HAVING
            COUNT(*) <= 6
    );
```

### Alternative (Using Window Functions for potentially better performance on very large datasets):

A more modern or often more performant approach in SQL engines that support window functions effectively is to use a CTE or subquery to calculate the count without explicit grouping in the main filter:

```sql
WITH CaseCounts AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        -- Calculate the total number of events for the current case_id
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) as event_count
    FROM
        event_log
)
SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp
    -- Add other columns if necessary, excluding 'event_count' if it's not needed in the final output
FROM
    CaseCounts
WHERE
    event_count <= 6;
```
