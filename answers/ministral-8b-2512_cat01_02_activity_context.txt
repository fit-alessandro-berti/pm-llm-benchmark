### **Analysis & Renaming Strategy**

The log contains **three recurring activities** that change meaning based on their position in the workflow and associated context:

1. **`Verify Documents`**
   - **First occurrence**: Initial identity check (e.g., "Agent checks identity documents").
   - **Second occurrence**: Re-verification after missing documents are provided (e.g., "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided").
   - **Third occurrence (C003)**: Re-verification after an account adjustment.

2. **`Call Customer`**
   - **First occurrence (C001, C002, C003)**: Follow-up to request missing information (e.g., "Verification incomplete," "clarify account discrepancy," "Customer stepped out").
   - **Second occurrence (C002)**: Follow-up to confirm adjustments.

3. **`Adjust Account`**
   - Only appears once per case, but its role varies slightly (e.g., correcting discrepancies vs. internal corrections).

### **Renamed Activities & Justification**

#### **1. `Verify Documents`  Disambiguated as:**
- **`Initial Document Verification`** (First occurrence)
  - *Justification*: The first check is a baseline identity verification before any follow-ups.
- **`Re-Verify Documents`** (Second occurrence)
  - *Justification*: Indicates a repeat check after missing information is provided.
- **`Post-Adjustment Document Verification`** (C003)
  - *Justification*: Explicitly ties the verification to the prior account adjustment.

#### **2. `Call Customer`  Disambiguated as:**
- **`Request Missing Documents Call`** (C001)
  - *Justification*: The call is made because verification is incomplete.
- **`Clarify Account Discrepancy Call`** (C002, first call)
  - *Justification*: The call is to resolve an account issue, not just missing docs.
- **`Follow-Up Confirmation Call`** (C002, second call)
  - *Justification*: The call confirms adjustments were made correctly.
- **`Customer Absence Follow-Up Call`** (C003)
  - *Justification*: The call is to ensure the customer returns (not for missing docs or account issues).

#### **3. `Adjust Account` (No renaming needed, but context clarifies role)**
   - Already distinct in meaning (e.g., correcting discrepancies vs. internal corrections).

### **Key Improvements**
1. **`Verify Documents`** is now clearly segmented into:
   - **Initial check** (baseline verification).
   - **Re-verification** (after missing docs are provided).
   - **Post-adjustment check** (after account corrections).

2. **`Call Customer`** is now contextually precise:
   - **Missing docs**  `Request Missing Documents Call`.
   - **Account discrepancies**  `Clarify Account Discrepancy Call`.
   - **Follow-up confirmations**  `Follow-Up Confirmation Call`.
   - **Customer absence**  `Customer Absence Follow-Up Call`.

3. **`Submit Additional Documents`** was added (instead of reusing `Submit Additional`) to clarify the customer’s action.

This renaming ensures **process clarity** and **traceability** in workflow analysis.
