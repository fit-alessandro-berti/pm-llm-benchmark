To analyze potential unfair differences between the treatment of the "protected" and "unprotected" groups in the rental process, I will focus on several key factors, including frequency distribution, process complexity (number of process steps), and performance times (execution times in milliseconds). Here's a detailed comparison regarding each aspect:

---

### 1. **Frequency Disparity:**

- **Frequency of Rejection:**  
  - For the **protected group**, the total frequency of cases leading to prospective tenants being **rejected** at different stages is higher relative to the total number of cases. Here are some examples:
    - `"Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant"`: 1,036 times.
    - `"Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant"`: 484 times.
    - Total Rejection-Related Frequency (across various paths in protected group): 2,679.
  
  - For the **unprotected group**, rejection occurs with a similar defined process but with higher individual frequencies in fewer paths:
    - `"Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant"`: 2,490 times.
    - `"Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant"`: 365 times.
    - Total Rejection-Related Frequency (across 2 paths in unprotected group): 3,155.

    Although the unprotected group has a higher absolute frequency of rejection cases, the protected group sees a higher **relative complexity** of rejection paths.

- **Significant Difference:**
  - The **unprotected group** has fewer and more streamlined rejection processes with a smaller variance (most rejections happen through two main paths).
  - The **protected group** sees a broader variety of rejection paths (four different rejection scenarios). This might indicate a more complex or burdensome process for rejecting tenants from the protected group, leading to higher cases of early termination.

### 2. **Process Complexity (Process Steps):**

- **Protected Group:**
  - Some paths for this group involve more steps, such as `"Extensive Screening,"` even when the ultimate outcome is still rejection. For example:
    - `"Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (793 cases)`.
    - `"Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> etc."`
  
  - This complexity might suggest a higher burden or more time-consuming process for the protected group, as these sequences tend towards longer, multi-step evaluations. The **protected group** also sees more variation reaching non-favorable outcomes.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The process for the unprotected group seems more streamlined and primarily focuses on rejection after fewer steps or clear-cut approvals for move-in. For example:
    - `"Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant"` (2,490 cases).
    - The **protected group** sees more occurrences of paths that involve multiple loops of rent payments before they cancel apartments.
  
  - The unprotected group's **rejection or approval** process seems more efficient and quicker, often involving fewer intermediate steps before a final decision.

### 3. **Performance/Execution Time:**

- **Higher Execution Times for the Protected Group:**  
  Comparing similar rejection paths between the two groups:
  - For `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant`:
    - The **protected group** has an execution time of **89,999 ms**.
    - The **unprotected group** has a significantly faster execution time of **80,002 ms**.
  - This pattern holds for other rejection paths as well:
    - The **protected group** tends to have **higher execution times**, especially when there is extensive screening.
    - For example, in cases involving `"Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant"`:
      - Protected group: **540,011 ms**.
      - Unprotected group: **480,013 ms**.

- **Approval and Stay Duration:**
  - For instances where tenants **sign contracts and move in**, the **unprotected group** enjoys faster process completion times:
    - Protected group: `"Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment"`: **810,021.897 ms**.
    - Unprotected group: `"Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment"`: **640,003.769 ms**.
  
  - The **protected group** also has paths with **significantly higher performance times** in the cases of long-tenure rentals, appearing to face more delays to reach favorable outcomes.

### 4. **Unfair Differences (Potential Unfairness / Bias Indicators)**

Based on the insights gleaned from process complexity, performance times, and rejection rates, we can conclude:

- **Process Complexity Burden:** The **protected group** is subjected to more complex processes (with more steps), making it potentially more difficult for them to achieve favorable outcomes (leasing contracts) or resulting in prolonged processing times before rejection. This suggests that the protected group might be **facing additional scrutiny**, which could be seen as an unfair barrier to securing housing.
  
- **Longer Performance Times:** The **protected group** consistently experiences **longer process times**, both for rejection and approval pathways. This could indicate delays in reaching housing decisions, particularly if the group has to wait significantly longer for the same status updates as the unprotected group. These delays suggest potential **inefficiencies or additional administrative burdens** imposed on the protected group.

- **Extensive Screening Bias:** The protected group more frequently undergoes `"Extensive Screening"`, middle- to long-term processes, and possible baking-stage hoops exacerbating potential discrimination, where fewer resources may be executed clarer signals against neighborhoods renting more nimble
