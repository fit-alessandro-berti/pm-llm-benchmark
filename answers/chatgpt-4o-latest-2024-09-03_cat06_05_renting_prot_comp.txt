### Main Differences Between the Protected and Unprotected Groups

Analyzing the process variants for both the protected and unprotected groups in the context of property leasing/housing, several key differences emerge:

### 1. **Frequency of Rejections (Discrimination in Tenant Screening)**

- **Protected Group**:
  - Higher frequency of rejections, especially in simpler processes (e.g., without much paperwork or screening).
  - For example:
    - `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant` occurs **484 times** (performance = 89999.306).
    - `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant` occurs **1036 times** (performance = 270000.477).
  - There are more pathways that lead to rejection after additional steps, e.g., paperwork and extensive screening.

- **Unprotected Group**:
  - While rejections **do occur**, they tend to appear **less frequently** in simpler transactions.
  - For example:
    - `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant` occurs only **365 times** (performance = 80002.688).
    - `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant` occurs **674 times** (performance = 240000.654).

**Interpretation**: The protected group is facing disproportionately higher rejection rates compared to the unprotected group, especially in earlier or simpler stages of the process. This might indicate bias or prejudice that leads to automatic rejection, potentially without fair assessment.

### 2. **Waiting/Processing Time (Performance Evaluation)**

- **Protected Group**:
  - The average performance (execution time) for similar processes in the protected group often takes longer.
  - For example:
    - `Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant` takes roughly **540011.977** units of time for protected tenants vs. **480013.530** for unprotected tenants.

- **Unprotected Group**:
  - Comparatively, performance times (processing times) are consistently **faster** for similar steps.
  - For instance, the average time until rejection or approval is almost always lower for unprotected individuals in many phases, such as **400004.640** vs. **449997.746** for a typical process involving partial screening and rejection.

**Interpretation**: The protected group tends to undergo longer waiting times in multiple stages of the process. This could reflect inefficient processing or potentially deliberate stalling tactics that unfairly disadvantage protected tenants.

### 3. **Pathways Leading to Successful Outcomes (Contracts Signed)**

- **Protected Group**:
  - Very **few successful property rentals** result in long-term leases with multiple rent payments.
  - For example:
    - Instances where tenants move in and pay rent occur far less frequently. Even in the longest process variations, the frequency remains low (e.g., `frequency = 11` or fewer for long leases).

- **Unprotected Group**:
  - The **unprotected** group **achieves positive outcomes** more frequently.
  - For example:
    - Common scenarios like tenants paying multiple rent payments and eventually canceling the lease (post-moving in) occur often (e.g., `frequency = 268`, `frequency = 223`, etc.).

**Interpretation**: The protected group faces more barriers, leading to fewer instances of successfully obtaining housing, signing leases, and paying rent over a longer term. This indicates a disparity in access to successful lease completions.

### 4. **Extensive Screening Disparities**

- **Protected Group**:
  - **Extensive screening** (which theoretically should represent deeper checks) occurs earlier and more often for the protected group before reaching a point of rejection or approval.
  - Processes involving **extensive screening** tend to correlate with much longer overall performance times and **end more frequently** in rejections for the protected group.
  
- **Unprotected Group**:
  - While the unprotected group undergoes extensive screening, the frequency of positive outcomes (i.e., signed contracts followed by multiple rent payments) is significantly higher compared to the protected group, even after extensive screening.
  - For example:
    - `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In` shows a much higher frequency (e.g., **56 or 44 times** for longer leases with multiple rent payments) compared to fewer successful results for the protected group (e.g., `frequency = 6` or even less).

**Interpretation**: The extensive screening process tends to **disproportionately burden** the protected group and delays or denies access to housing. It may be indicative of systemic bias where more hurdles are placed on these applicants, even with similar credentials as unprotected applicants.

### 5. **Higher Occurrences of Lease Termination and Evictions in Protected Group**

- **Protected Group**:
  - A noticeable process variant involves **missed rent payments, warnings, and evictions** (e.g., `frequency = 6`) for the protected group.
  - This pathway suggests that those in the protected group who might manage to secure housing are more likely to face evictions.

- **Unprotected Group**:
  - There are **no clear eviction-related pathways** for the unprotected group in the reported sequences.
  
**Interpretation**: The protected group not only faces difficulties in accessing housing but also in retaining it. The occurrence of evictions in the protected group seems to reflect an elevated risk for forced lease termination, adding to the unequal treatment.

### Closing Thoughts

The process data suggests substantial **disparities in treatment** between protected and unprotected groups. These might indicate systemic issues such as discrimination in tenant screening, longer processing times for protected individuals, higher rejection rates, and fewer pathways to successful long-term leases for the protected group. Even when the protected group manages to secure a lease, they are faced with a higher risk of eviction compared to the unprotected group, underscoring an inequitable housing process.
