Normative baseline (simplified Hire-to-Retire)
- Post job ad  screen candidates  conduct interviews  make hiring decision
- If hire: onboard  add to payroll  close case
- If no hire: close case
- Close_Case should be the last event of the instance

Analysis of POWL Model 1
- Structure: A single partial order; all activities must occur once; ordering constraints:
  - Post  Screen
  - Screen  Decide and Screen  Interview
  - Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close
  - No constraints between Interview and Decide/Onboard/Payroll/Close beyond “after Screen”
- Anomalies
  - Major: Decision may precede interviews (Interview and Decide are unordered). The model permits hiring decisions without interviews.
  - Major: Interviews can occur after onboarding, after payroll, and even after closing the case, because Interview is only constrained by Screen. Example legal run: Post, Screen, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close, Interview.
  - Major: Close_Case is not guaranteed to be last (as shown above).
  - Major: No rejection path. Decide is always followed by Onboard; the process always hires and never closes directly after a negative decision.
  - Minor: Interviews are always mandatory (no way to skip interviews for a clearly qualified internal candidate), though this is less problematic than the issues above.
- What it gets right
  - Screening precedes interviews (Screen  Interview).
  - Payroll is mandatory and after onboarding (Onboard  Payroll), which aligns with a typical employee hire.

Analysis of POWL Model 2
- Structure: Partial order plus:
  - Loop(Onboard, skip): Onboard must occur at least once and may repeat
  - XOR(Payroll, skip): Payroll is optional
  - Ordering constraints:
    - Post  Screen and Post  Interview
    - Interview  Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close
- Anomalies
  - Major: Screen is only constrained by Post; it can happen anytime after posting, even after Close. Example legal run: Post, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Payroll (or skip), Close, Screen.
  - Major: No rejection path; Decide always leads into the onboarding loop (i.e., always hire).
  - Major: Payroll is optional (XOR with skip). For employee hires, skipping payroll is non-compliant.
  - Moderate: Onboarding can repeat arbitrarily via the loop, which is unusual for a single hire (could reflect rework but is typically modeled at a finer granularity).
  - Moderate: Interviews may start without completed screening (Screen is not a prerequisite). Often screening should gate interviews.
- What it gets right
  - Crucial precedence: decision after interviews (Interview  Decide).
  - Onboarding occurs after the decision; Close occurs after the hire path has been taken (though not last w.r.t. Screen).

Which model is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire?
- Model 2 is closer overall. It preserves the central causal backbone that interviews inform the hiring decision (Interview  Decide) and that onboarding follows the decision. In Model 1, the decision can be taken before any interview and interviews may even occur after the case is closed—this breaks the essence of the hiring logic and the meaning of Close_Case more severely.
- That said, Model 2 still has serious defects (optional payroll, always-hire, screening allowed after closure). But these are easier to fix structurally than the missing dependency between interviews and decision and the “post-closure interviews” permitted by Model 1.

Recommended fixes
- For Model 1
  - Add Interview  Decide; add Decide  XOR(Hire, Reject), where Hire  Onboard  Payroll and Reject  Close.
  - Constrain Close to be last (e.g., make Close succeed both Payroll and the Reject branch).
  - Optionally allow multiple interviews via a loop around Conduct_Interviews if needed.
- For Model 2
  - Make Screen a prerequisite: Screen  Interview (and optionally Screen  Decide).
  - Replace Decide  loop_onboarding with Decide  XOR(Hire, Reject), where Hire  Onboard and Reject  Close.
  - Remove the onboarding loop unless rework is explicitly intended; if rework is needed, model it at task level.
  - Make Payroll mandatory on the Hire path (remove XOR(skip) or move skip to model contractor/non-employee processes in a separate variant).
  - Ensure Close is the final sink after both the Hire and Reject branches.
