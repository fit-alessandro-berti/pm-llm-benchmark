## Step 1: Understand the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Process
The Procure-to-Pay process typically involves several key steps: creating a purchase requisition, approving the purchase requisition, issuing a purchase order, receiving goods, receiving a vendor invoice, matching the invoice to the purchase order, releasing payment, and closing the case. Understanding this sequence is crucial for identifying anomalies.

## Step 2: Examine the Event Log for Case 1001
For Case ID 1001, the sequence is: Create Purchase Requisition, Approve Purchase Requisition, Issue Purchase Order, Receive Goods, Vendor Invoice Received, Match Invoice to PO, Release Payment, Close Case. This sequence follows the typical P2P process flow.

## Step 3: Examine the Event Log for Case 1002
For Case ID 1002, the sequence is: Create Purchase Requisition, Issue Purchase Order, Vendor Invoice Received, Release Payment, Approve Purchase Requisition, Receive Goods, Match Invoice to PO, Close Case. This sequence is anomalous because "Issue Purchase Order" occurs before "Approve Purchase Requisition", and "Release Payment" happens before "Receive Goods" and "Match Invoice to PO". This is problematic as it suggests payment was made without proper approval of the requisition and before verifying the goods were received and the invoice matched the purchase order.

## Step 4: Examine the Event Log for Case 1003
For Case ID 1003, the sequence is: Create Purchase Requisition, Approve Purchase Requisition, Issue Purchase Order, Release Payment, Vendor Invoice Received, Receive Goods, Match Invoice to PO, Close Case. This sequence is anomalous because "Release Payment" occurs before "Vendor Invoice Received" and "Receive Goods". This is problematic as payment was made before receiving the goods and the invoice, violating typical P2P controls.

## Step 5: Examine the Event Log for Case 1004
For Case ID 1004, the sequence is: Create Purchase Requisition, Approve Purchase Requisition, Receive Goods, Issue Purchase Order, Vendor Invoice Received, Match Invoice to PO, Release Payment, Close Case. This sequence is anomalous because "Receive Goods" happens before "Issue Purchase Order". Typically, goods should be received after a purchase order has been issued. This could indicate an issue with the process or recording of events.

## Step 6: Summarize Anomalies and Potential Issues
- Case 1002: "Issue Purchase Order" before "Approve Purchase Requisition" and "Release Payment" before "Receive Goods" and "Match Invoice to PO". Potential issues include lack of proper approval before ordering and payment without verification of goods receipt and invoice matching.
- Case 1003: "Release Payment" before "Vendor Invoice Received" and "Receive Goods". Potential issue includes payment before receipt of goods and invoice.
- Case 1004: "Receive Goods" before "Issue Purchase Order". Potential issue includes receipt of goods without a proper purchase order.

## Step 7: Analyze Why These Anomalies Are Problematic
These anomalies can lead to financial, operational, and compliance risks. For example, releasing payment before receiving goods or verifying invoices can result in overpayment or payment for undelivered goods. Issuing a purchase order before approving the requisition can lead to unauthorized purchases. Receiving goods before issuing a purchase order can indicate a lack of control over procurement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1002, 1003, 1004}$
