In the context of fairness in process mining, sensitive attributes are those that could potentially introduce bias in the process outcomes. These attributes are typically related to personal characteristics that should not influence the treatment of individuals in a fair process. Based on the provided event log and attributes, the following attributes are sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates the citizenship status of the cases (True or False). It is a personal characteristic that can be sensitive as it could potentially lead to different treatment based on citizenship.

2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the cases (True or False). Gender is a sensitive attribute because it is a personal characteristic that should not influence the process outcomes in a fair system.

3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a German speaker (True or False). Language proficiency is another sensitive attribute as it can potentially lead to different treatment based on linguistic abilities.

These attributes are considered sensitive because they pertain to personal characteristics that could potentially introduce bias in the process. Ensuring fairness in the process would involve analyzing whether these attributes have a disproportionate impact on process outcomes and addressing any identified biases.
