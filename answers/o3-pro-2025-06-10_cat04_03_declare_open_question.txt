Below is a “business-side reading” of every activity and every constraint that appears in the DECLARE model, followed by an integrated view of how the whole rule-set supports the goals of a modern, strictly regulated loan-origination process.

--------------------------------------------------
1. What each activity means in day-to-day work
--------------------------------------------------
A  Receive Application – A clerk or an on-line front-end captures the customer’s request (forms, ID, purpose of loan, etc.).

B  Preliminary Credit Check – A single, automated pull of credit bureau data that produces a score and an initial risk class.

C  Gather Additional Documents – Income statements, pay slips, collateral evidence, KYC/AML documents, anything the first check flagged as missing.

D  Assemble Loan Offer Package – Back-office creates the proposed terms (amount, rate, tenor, covenants, fees).

E  Quality Assurance Review – Second-line control (risk/compliance) re-reads everything for completeness, legal correctness, and policy alignment.

F  Authorize Contract Terms – Formal sign-off (credit committee, automated decision engine, or manager approval).

G  Transfer Funds – Disbursement through core-banking, SWIFT or ACH.

H  Notify Customer – E-mail/SMS/letter with the decision, contract, or disbursement confirmation.

Z  Proceed Without Compliance – A red-flag action that must never occur (e.g., giving money before passing compliance).

--------------------------------------------------
2. What every constraint is doing for the business
--------------------------------------------------

EXISTENCE  
• Receive Application; Gather Additional Documents  
  – Both must happen at least once  every case is properly initiated and properly documented (baseline regulatory requirement).

ABSENCE  
• Proceed Without Compliance  
  – Must never occur  hard guard against non-compliant shortcuts (meets SOX / internal audit expectations).

EXACTLY-ONE  
• Preliminary Credit Check  
  – Done once and only once  prevents “fishing” for better scores and avoids paying multiple bureau fees; audit trail stays clean.

INIT  
• Receive Application  
  – First step of every trace  prevents “phantom” processing of people who never applied (GDPR lawful-basis requirement).

RESPONDED-EXISTENCE  
• Assemble Loan Offer Package  Quality Assurance Review  
  – Whenever a package is assembled, QA must eventually review it; QA may also appear in other circumstances, but can never be skipped after D.

COEXISTENCE  
• Gather Additional Documents  Authorize Contract Terms  
  – If extra docs were requested, final authorization is mandatory (avoids issuing terms based only on the preliminary check).

RESPONSE  
• Receive Application  Preliminary Credit Check  
  – Ensures risk is assessed before anything else; satisfies consumer-credit rules that a decision must be based on a documented credit evaluation.

PRECEDENCE  
• Quality Assurance Review  Authorize Contract Terms  
  – F must occur only if E has already happened; authorization cannot precede QA review (four-eyes principle).

SUCCESSION  
• Preliminary Credit Check  Gather Additional Documents  
  – After seeing the score, the organization must either confirm or improve the data set (standard risk-based KYC).

ALT-RESPONSE  
• Transfer Funds  Notify Customer  
  – At least one of the two must follow the other; both may occur, order is fixed by other rules. Guarantees the customer is informed or funds are moved—no silent failure.

ALT-PRECEDENCE  
• Notify Customer  Transfer Funds  
  – Symmetric partner to the previous rule: whichever of the two occurs, the other must have happened before or will happen after. Combined, they make the pair obligatory and order-agnostic.

ALT-SUCCESSION  
• Gather Additional Documents  Quality Assurance Review  
  – If documents are gathered, either QA review or some other activity leading to QA review must follow; gives flexibility but blocks abandonment.

CHAIN-RESPONSE  
• Assemble Loan Offer Package  Transfer Funds (immediately next)  
  – When terms are assembled and later accepted, the next step must be disbursement (no un-controlled intermediate steps, avoids tampering).

CHAIN-PRECEDENCE  
• Authorize Contract Terms  Preliminary Credit Check (immediately before)  
  – Signing off must be **directly** preceded by the credit result; ensures authorizers view the final risk profile, not an outdated one.

CHAIN-SUCCESSION  
• Quality Assurance Review  Assemble Loan Offer Package  
  – Once QA approves, the very next activity is to build/issue the offer, preserving the context QA validated.

NON-COEXISTENCE  
• Transfer Funds  Receive Application cannot both appear  
  – Implies disbursement must sit in a **different case** (e.g., funding executed in the core-banking system, not in the origination case) or points to a modeling artefact signaling separation of origination and settlement logs.

NON-SUCCESSION  
• Notify Customer    Preliminary Credit Check  
  – After telling the customer something, the process must not loop back to do another credit check; avoids changing the decision post-communication (consumer protection).

NON-CHAIN-SUCCESSION  
• Authorize Contract Terms  Notify Customer  
  – “Immediately after authorization do NOT notify” – forces at least one more internal step (e.g., book-entry posting) before external communication; reduces insider information risk.

--------------------------------------------------
3. How the rules fit together
--------------------------------------------------
1. Sequencing & completeness  
   • INIT + RESPONSE + SUCCESSION + CHAIN rules knit A  B  C  E  F  D  G/H into a tight, linear skeleton.  
   • EXISTENCE ensures no mandatory step is forgotten, while EXACTLY-ONE avoids costly repetitions.

2. Quality & compliance  
   • PRECEDENCE, COEXISTENCE and RESPONDED-EXISTENCE guarantee that every credit decision is double-checked (E) and formally sanctioned (F), meeting “four-eyes” and “maker–checker” controls from the EBA and Basel guidelines.  
   • ABSENCE (Z) plus NON-* constraints keep the path clear of policy breaches.

3. Transparency & auditability  
   • Each constraint leaves a deterministic trail: auditors can replay the log and know exactly why and when something occurred.  
   • ALT* constraints introduce flexibility without losing traceability; whichever path is chosen, it is explicitly documented.

--------------------------------------------------
4. Likely business and regulatory motives
--------------------------------------------------
• Consumer-credit regulation (Truth in Lending Act, EU CCD) – must base a lending decision on a documented credit assessment that is disclosed to the customer.  
• KYC/AML – Gather Additional Documents is mandatory when risk level is medium/high.  
• Basel II/III & IFRS 9 – Single credit check plus QA review supply the risk inputs for capital calculation and provisioning.  
• SOX / Internal Control Over Financial Reporting – No funds moved without a recorded, authorized approval chain.  
• GDPR & data-minimisation – Only one credit pull, stored in a controlled manner.  
• Reputational risk – ABSENCE of “Proceed Without Compliance” and NON-SUCCESSION after “Notify Customer” protect customer rights and the bank’s brand.

--------------------------------------------------
5. Bottom-line
--------------------------------------------------
The DECLARE model codifies a “trust-by-design” loan-origination pipeline. Mandatory steps (existence/init), one-time checks (exactly-one), controlled reviews (response/precedence/succession), and explicit prohibitions (absence, non-*) combine to ensure that:

• every loan starts with a valid request,  
• risk is assessed exactly once and before any contractual commitment,  
• additional evidence is collected whenever needed,  
• an independent quality gate reviews the offer,  
• authorization happens only after QA,  
• money moves only after all approvals, and  
• the customer is never left uninformed.

Such a rule-set satisfies both business imperatives (speed, customer trust, cost control) and a dense web of legal requirements, delivering a process that is at once efficient, auditable, and regulator-ready.
