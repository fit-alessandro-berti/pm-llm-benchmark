Here is the updated `declare_model`, with bias-mitigation constraints added alongside the original ones:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision":    {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}

        # After any sensitive-attribute check, a bias mitigation check must eventually occur

        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge":    {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "coexistence": {
        # Original process constraint
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # If a decision involves a minority applicant, there must also be a ManualReview
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority":  {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },

    },

        # No Approve/Reject unless a BiasMitigationCheck has occurred earlier
        "Approve": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject":  {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        # Original process constraint

        "CheckApplicantRace":   {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge":    {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {
        # Prevent any directsuccessive transition from a sensitive-attribute check to a decision
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject":  {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "CheckApplicantGender": {

        },
        "CheckApplicantAge": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject":  {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

Rationale for each added constraint:

• responded_existence (CheckApplicant*  BiasMitigationCheck)  
Whenever any sensitive attribute (race, gender, age) is inspected, the process must eventually perform a dedicated BiasMitigationCheck, ensuring no attributedriven decision goes unchecked.

• chainresponse (CheckApplicant*  BiasMitigationCheck)  
Strengthens the above by forcing the BiasMitigationCheck to occur immediately after the attribute check, preventing any intervening decision step.

• nonchainsuccession (CheckApplicant*  Approve/Reject)  
Prohibits a direct succession from a sensitiveattribute event to a decision, so that an “Approve” or “Reject” cannot immediately follow a raw attribute check without the mitigation step in between.

• precedence (Approve/Reject  BiasMitigationCheck)  
Ensures that every final decision is only taken if a bias mitigation activity has already occurred somewhere earlier in the trace.

• coexistence (Approve_Minority/Reject_Minority  ManualReview)  
Mandates that any decision involving a minority applicant cooccurs with a ManualReview elsewhere in the trace, adding human oversight for sensitive cases.
