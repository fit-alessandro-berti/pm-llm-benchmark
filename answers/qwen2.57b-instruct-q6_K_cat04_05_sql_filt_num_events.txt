Certainly! Below is a DuckDB SQL query that filters out cases with more than six events and returns only the events from cases that have six or fewer events in total:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
JOIN 
    case_event_counts cec
ON 
    el.case_id = cec.case_id
WHERE 
    cec.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `case_event_counts`:**
   - This CTE calculates the number of events (`event_count`) for each `case_id` by grouping the rows in the `event_log` table.
   
2. **Main Query:**
   - The main query joins the original `event_log` table with the `case_event_counts` CTE on the `case_id`.
   - It then filters out only those cases where the event count is 6 or fewer (`cec.event_count <= 6`).
   - Finally, it selects all columns from the `event_log` for these filtered cases.

This query ensures that you get a list of events only from those process instances (cases) that have six or fewer events.
