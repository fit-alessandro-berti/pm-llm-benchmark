The provided visualization consists of two main components:

1. **Process Flow Diagram** (top diagram):
   - Represents a sequence of activities in a process starting from the initial step (a) 'register request' leading to various tasks such as 'examine thoroughly' (b), 'examine casually' (c), and 'check ticket' (d). Each of these processes lead towards a decision point (e) 'decide', from which the flow can lead to either 'pay compensation' (g), 'reject request' (h), or reinitiate the request through 'reinitiate request' (f). The process ends at the step 'end' (z).
   - The diagram shows multiple decision points where paths split and converge, indicating that various outcomes can result based on different conditions or decisions made within the process flow.

2. **Gateways Legend** (bottom rectangle):
   - This is a legend or reference guide explaining different gateway types used in process diagrams like the one shown above. It shows symbols for "XOR-split", "AND-split", and "OR-split", each illustrating how process flows can diverge based on conditions or parallel paths. Corresponding "join" symbols for each type show how paths in the process can converge.
   - "XOR" (Exclusive OR) indicates that only one path can be taken out of the available options.
   - "AND" indicates that all paths will be taken simultaneously (parallel processing).
   - "OR" indicates that one or more paths can be taken, decided dynamically at runtime.

Together, these diagrams are likely used to plan or analyze a business process, providing clear visual instructions and decision-making protocols through various steps and conditions.
