Alright, let's start by identifying the key activities mentioned in the interviews. I'll go through each interview and list out the tasks described.

From Mary's interview:

Receive invoice (by email)
Check for valid purchase order (PO) number
If no PO, send back to supplier for more details
If PO present, log invoice into accounting system
Forward invoice to purchasing department for confirmation of goods/services received
Match invoice line items against PO
If match, send to department manager for approval
If discrepancy, email purchasing team to clarify
If discrepancy can't be resolved easily, escalate to supervisor
Once issues resolved and manager approves, schedule for payment
From Dan's interview:

Receive invoice from Accounts Payable
Check invoice details against PO (quantities, prices, delivery charges)
If discrepancy, contact supplier or ask AP to hold invoice until corrected
If correct, send confirmation email back to AP
If PO number missing, inform AP to get information before proceeding
From Carlos's interview:

Receive notification for approval after matching and confirmation
Review invoice details, PO, and confirmation
If all good, approve in the system
If suspicious, reject or ask AP to investigate further
From Rita's interview:

Handle exceptions when AP can't match invoice or Purchasing has issues
Contact suppliers or coordinate between departments
For invoices without PO (e.g., informal services), work with department heads to create retrospective PO or decide to reject
After resolving exceptions, invoice goes back to normal flow
From Karen's interview:

Get involved if AP or Purchasing finds invoice doesn't match agreed terms
Reach out to suppliers for missing PO or pricing discrepancies
Check contracts for correct pricing
Now, let's try to sequence these activities in a logical order, considering the flow described by the interviewees.

Starting with Mary:

Receive invoice
Check for PO
If no PO, send back to supplier
If PO present, log into system
Forward to Purchasing for confirmation
Then, Dan in Purchasing:

Receive invoice from AP
Check against PO
If discrepancy, contact supplier or hold invoice
If correct, confirm back to AP
Back to Mary:

After confirmation, match invoice against PO
If match, send to manager for approval
If discrepancy, email Purchasing to clarify or escalate to supervisor
Then, Carlos:

Receive notification
Review and approve or reject
Finally, Mary:

Schedule for payment after approval
Additionally, Rita handles exceptions, and Karen assists with supplier-related issues.

Now, let's think about the decision points or gateways.

First gateway: After receiving invoice, check for PO.

If no PO, send back to supplier (end of process for that invoice)
If PO present, proceed to log into system
Second gateway: After matching invoice against PO

If match, send to manager for approval
If discrepancy, email Purchasing or escalate
Third gateway: Manager's approval

If approved, schedule for payment
If rejected or needs investigation, go back to AP for further action
Also, there might be a loop for discrepancies: if Purchasing clarifies, it might go back to matching step.

Moreover, for exceptions handled by Rita, there could be a separate path or a subprocess.

Let me try to outline the main sequence:

Start: Receive invoice

Check for PO

a. If no PO, send back to supplier (end)

b. If PO present, log into system

Forward to Purchasing for confirmation

Purchasing checks invoice against PO

a. If discrepancy, contact supplier or hold invoice

i. If supplier corrects, proceed

ii. If not, might involve Karen or Rita

b. If correct, confirm back to AP

AP matches invoice against PO

a. If match, send to manager for approval

b. If discrepancy, email Purchasing to clarify or escalate to supervisor

Manager reviews and approves or rejects

a. If approved, schedule for payment (end)

b. If rejected, go back to AP for investigation

For the exceptions, perhaps there's a parallel path or a subprocess that can be triggered at certain points, like when a discrepancy can't be resolved easily.

Also, Karen's involvement seems to be more of a supporting role, providing information when needed.

Now, let's consider the roles involved:

Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary): receives invoice, checks PO, logs into system, forwards to Purchasing, matches invoice, sends to manager, schedules payment
Purchasing Officer (Dan): checks invoice against PO, confirms or reports discrepancies
Department Manager (Carlos): approves or rejects invoice
Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita): handles exceptions, coordinates resolution
Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen): assists with supplier-related issues
In terms of artifacts or data objects:

Invoice: the main document flowing through the process
Purchase Order (PO): referenced for matching
Confirmation email from Purchasing
Approval notification to manager
Payment schedule
Now, let's try to structure this into a BPMN-like textual description.

First, the main lane or pool could be "Accounts Payable," with sub-lanes for Clerk and Supervisor.

Then, another pool for "Purchasing," with the Officer.

Another pool for "Department Manager."

And perhaps another for "Supplier Relationship Manager," though her involvement might be more ad-hoc.

Wait, actually, in BPMN, pools typically represent different organizations or departments. Here, all seem to be within the same organization, so maybe lanes within a single pool.

Let's assume one pool for the organization, with lanes for:

Accounts Payable Clerk
Purchasing Officer
Department Manager
Accounts Payable Supervisor
Supplier Relationship Manager
Now, let's map the activities to these lanes.

Starting with Accounts Payable Clerk:

Receive invoice
Check for PO
If no PO, send back to supplier
If PO present, log into system
Forward to Purchasing
Then, Purchasing Officer:

Check invoice against PO
If discrepancy, contact supplier or hold invoice
If correct, send confirmation to AP
Back to Accounts Payable Clerk:

Match invoice against PO
If match, send to Manager for approval
If discrepancy, email Purchasing or escalate to Supervisor
Then, Department Manager:

Review and approve or reject
If approved, back to Accounts Payable Clerk:

Schedule for payment
If rejected, back to Accounts Payable Clerk for investigation.

Additionally, for exceptions, Accounts Payable Supervisor:

Handle exceptions, coordinate resolution
And Supplier Relationship Manager:

Assist with supplier issues when needed
Now, to make this more precise, let's define the sequence flows and gateways.

Let's start from the beginning.

Event: Start - Invoice received

Task: Check for PO (by AP Clerk)

Gateway: Exclusive gateway based on PO presence

If no PO, Task: Send back to supplier (by AP Clerk), then End event
If PO present, Task: Log into system (by AP Clerk)
Then, Task: Forward to Purchasing (by AP Clerk)

Message flow: Invoice sent to Purchasing

Task: Check invoice against PO (by Purchasing Officer)

Gateway: Exclusive gateway based on check result

If discrepancy, Task: Contact supplier or hold invoice (by Purchasing Officer)

This might involve a subprocess or a loop until resolved
For simplicity, let's say if resolved, proceed to confirmation
If not resolvable, perhaps escalate to Supervisor
If correct, Task: Send confirmation to AP (by Purchasing Officer)

Message flow: Confirmation sent to AP

Then, Task: Match invoice against PO (by AP Clerk)

Wait, actually, in Mary's description, after receiving confirmation from Purchasing, she matches the invoice against PO.

But in Dan's description, he already checked the invoice against PO.

Wait, there might be some overlap or redundancy here.

Let me check the transcripts again.

Mary says: "Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system."

Dan says: "I open up the PO and compare quantities, prices, and any delivery charges."

So, it seems that Purchasing checks the invoice against the PO for correctness, and then AP also matches it, perhaps as a double-check or for accounting purposes.

Alternatively, maybe Purchasing confirms receipt of goods/services, and AP matches the invoice details.

Wait, in Mary's first statement: "I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received."

Ah, so Purchasing confirms receipt, not necessarily checks the invoice details.

Wait, but Dan says: "check if the invoice details line up with what we ordered. I open up the PO and compare quantities, prices, and any delivery charges."

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps Purchasing does both: confirms receipt and checks the invoice details.

But in standard processes, often Purchasing confirms receipt, and AP matches the invoice to PO and receipt.

Let me see.

Actually, in many organizations, there's a three-way match: invoice, PO, and receiving document.

So, probably, Purchasing confirms that the goods were received (i.e., provides the receiving document), and then AP matches the invoice to the PO and the receiving document.

In Mary's statement, she says: "forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received."

Then, "Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system."

So, it seems that Purchasing confirms receipt, and AP matches invoice to PO, assuming that receipt confirmation implies that quantities match.

But Dan mentions checking quantities and prices, which suggests he might be doing more than just confirming receipt.

Alternatively, perhaps in this process, Purchasing does the full check.

But to reconcile, maybe Purchasing checks the invoice against the PO and confirms if it matches, including both receipt and details.

Then, AP might do a final verification before sending to manager.

But in Carlos's interview, he says: "Once the invoice has been matched to a PO and Dan confirms that everything is okay, I get a notification."

So, it seems that Dan confirms that everything is okay, meaning the invoice matches the PO and receipt.

Then, AP might not need to do another match.

Wait, but Mary says she matches after getting confirmation.

Perhaps it's a bit redundant, but let's assume that Purchasing confirms receipt and checks the invoice, then AP does a final match or verification before sending to manager.

Alternatively, maybe "matching" by AP is more about entering the data into the system for payment processing.

For simplicity, let's assume that Purchasing checks the invoice against PO and confirms receipt, then sends confirmation to AP, and AP proceeds to send to manager for approval, perhaps after some internal processing.

But to make it clearer, let's define it as:

AP Clerk: receives invoice, checks for PO, logs into system, forwards to Purchasing
Purchasing: confirms receipt of goods/services and checks invoice details against PO
If correct, sends confirmation to AP
If discrepancy, handles it (contacts supplier, etc.)
AP Clerk: upon receiving confirmation, prepares the invoice for approval (perhaps enters it into the system in a way that triggers the approval request)
Then, Manager: receives notification, reviews, and approves or rejects
If approved, AP Clerk schedules for payment
For exceptions, if Purchasing cannot resolve the discrepancy, it might be escalated to AP Supervisor.

Also, if the invoice has no PO, and it's for informal services, Rita might handle it by creating a retrospective PO.

So, let's try to incorporate that.

Additionally, Karen might be involved in communicating with suppliers, but perhaps that's part of the "contact supplier" task by Purchasing or AP.

For now, I'll focus on the main flow and exceptions.

Let me attempt to write the BPMN-like description.

Process: Invoice Approval Process

Pools:

Organization (with lanes: AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, AP Supervisor)
Start Event:

Invoice received (by AP Clerk)
Tasks:

AP Clerk: Check for PO

Gateway (Exclusive): PO present?

No: Task: Send back to supplier → End Event
Yes: Task: Log into system
AP Clerk: Forward invoice to Purchasing

Message Flow: Invoice to Purchasing
Purchasing Officer: Check invoice against PO and confirm receipt

Gateway (Exclusive): Invoice correct?

No: Task: Handle discrepancy (contact supplier, etc.)

This could be a subprocess, but for simplicity:

Task: Resolve discrepancy

Gateway (Exclusive): Resolved?

Yes: Proceed to confirmation
No: Escalate to AP Supervisor
Yes: Task: Send confirmation to AP

Message Flow: Confirmation to AP

AP Clerk: Prepare invoice for approval (e.g., enter into system for manager review)

Department Manager: Review and approve invoice

Gateway (Exclusive): Approved?

Yes: Task (AP Clerk): Schedule for payment → End Event

No: Task (AP Clerk): Investigate further

This might loop back to earlier steps or involve other actions, but for now, let's say it goes to End Event (invoice not approved)
Additionally, for the escalation:

From Purchasing, if discrepancy not resolved, escalate to AP Supervisor

AP Supervisor: Handle exception

This could involve various tasks, like contacting department heads, creating retrospective PO, etc.
After resolving, perhaps send back to Purchasing or AP Clerk to continue the process
But to keep it simple, let's assume that after handling the exception, the invoice either proceeds to confirmation or is refuted.

Similarly, if the manager rejects the invoice, AP Clerk investigates, which might involve similar exception handling.

Perhaps we can have a general "Exception Handling" subprocess that can be called at various points.

But for this textual description, I'll try to keep it linear.

Let me summarize the main flow:

Start: Invoice received

AP Clerk: Check for PO

If no PO: Send back to supplier → End
If PO present: Log into system → Forward to Purchasing
Purchasing: Check invoice and confirm receipt

If discrepancy: Try to resolve

If resolved: Send confirmation to AP
If not resolved: Escalate to AP Supervisor
If correct: Send confirmation to AP

AP Clerk: Prepare for approval → Send to Manager

Manager: Review and approve

If approved: AP Clerk schedules payment → End
If not approved: AP Clerk investigates → (potentially loop back or end)
For the AP Supervisor's role, perhaps when escalated, the Supervisor handles the exception, and if resolved, the invoice goes back to Purchasing or AP Clerk.

Similarly, if the manager rejects, AP Clerk might need to involve the Supervisor or take other actions.

But since the interviews don't specify exactly what happens after rejection or during exception handling, I'll keep it abstract.

Also, regarding Karen's role, since it's more supportive, I won't include a separate task for her, assuming that contacting suppliers might involve her indirectly.

Now, let's try to write it in a more structured way.

BPMN-like Textual Description:

Start Event: Invoice received

Lane: AP Clerk

Task: Check for PO

Exclusive Gateway: PO present?

No: Task: Send back to supplier → End Event
Yes: Task: Log invoice into system
Task: Forward invoice to Purchasing

Message Flow: Invoice to Purchasing

Lane: Purchasing Officer

Task: Check invoice against PO and confirm receipt

Exclusive Gateway: Invoice correct?

No: Task: Attempt to resolve discrepancy

Exclusive Gateway: Discrepancy resolved?

Yes: Task: Send confirmation to AP
No: Task: Escalate to AP Supervisor
Yes: Task: Send confirmation to AP

Message Flow: Confirmation to AP

Lane: AP Clerk

Task: Prepare invoice for manager approval
Lane: Department Manager

Task: Review invoice

Exclusive Gateway: Approve invoice?

Yes: Message Flow: Approval to AP
No: Message Flow: Rejection to AP
Lane: AP Clerk

Exclusive Gateway: Based on manager's decision

If approved: Task: Schedule for payment → End Event
If rejected: Task: Investigate further → End Event (for simplicity)
Additionally, for the escalation:

Lane: AP Supervisor

Task: Handle exception (when escalated from Purchasing)

After handling, perhaps Task: Return to normal flow (e.g., send back to Purchasing or AP Clerk)
But since the exact flow after exception handling isn't detailed, I'll leave it as is.

Wait, actually, in Rita's interview, she says: "After we clear up these exceptions, the invoice goes back into the normal flow: confirmation from Purchasing, approval by the Manager, then scheduling for payment."

So, after handling the exception, it goes back to the confirmation step.

Therefore, from the AP Supervisor, after handling the exception, it could go back to Purchasing to check again, or directly to AP Clerk to proceed.

For simplicity, let's assume it goes back to Purchasing to re-check.

So, modifying the earlier part:

From Purchasing, if discrepancy not resolved: Escalate to AP Supervisor

Then, AP Supervisor: Handle exception

After handling, send back to Purchasing to re-check.

Similarly, if the manager rejects, AP Clerk investigates, which might involve the Supervisor, and then potentially re-submit for approval.

But to avoid complexity, perhaps we can have a loop back.

Alternatively, for this description, I'll keep it as:

If manager rejects, AP Clerk investigates, and the process ends (invoice not approved).
But actually, in practice, there might be a rework loop, but since it's not specified, I'll keep it simple.

So, to finalize:

Final BPMN-like Textual Process Model:

Start Event: Invoice received

Lane: AP Clerk

Task: Check for Purchase Order (PO)

Exclusive Gateway: Is PO present?

No: Task: Send invoice back to supplier → End Event
Yes: Task: Log invoice into accounting system
Task: Forward invoice to Purchasing Department

Message Flow: Invoice sent to Purchasing

Lane: Purchasing Officer

Task: Check invoice against PO and confirm receipt of goods/services

Exclusive Gateway: Does invoice match PO and receipt?

No: Task: Attempt to resolve discrepancy (e.g., contact supplier)

Exclusive Gateway: Is discrepancy resolved?

Yes: Task: Send confirmation to AP
No: Task: Escalate to AP Supervisor
Yes: Task: Send confirmation to AP

Message Flow: Confirmation sent to AP

Lane: AP Clerk

Task: Prepare invoice for manager approval (e.g., trigger approval request in system)
Lane: Department Manager

Task: Review invoice details, PO, and confirmation

Exclusive Gateway: Approve invoice?

Yes: Message Flow: Approval notification to AP
No: Message Flow: Rejection notification to AP
Lane: AP Clerk

Exclusive Gateway: Based on manager's decision

If approved: Task: Schedule invoice for payment → End Event
If rejected: Task: Investigate further → End Event
Lane: AP Supervisor

Task: Handle exception (when escalated)
After handling, Task: Return invoice to Purchasing for re-check
Note: The process may have additional loops or subprocesses for handling exceptions and investigations, but they are not fully detailed in the interviews.

Also, the Supplier Relationship Manager may assist in contacting suppliers during discrepancy resolution, but this is not explicitly modeled.

This should provide a clear structure for the process based on the interview transcripts.

Below is a BPMN-like textual process model for the invoice approval process, derived from the interview excerpts provided by Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk), Dan (Purchasing Officer), Carlos (Department Manager), Rita (Accounts Payable Supervisor), and Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager). The model captures the key activities, sequence flow, decision points, roles, artifacts, and exceptions as described, consolidated into a clear and logical structure.

---

### **Invoice Approval Process: BPMN-like Textual Description**

#### **Process Overview**
This process outlines the steps for approving and scheduling payment for invoices received by the organization. It involves multiple roles within a single organizational pool, with handoffs between departments, decision points based on invoice validity and matching, and exception handling for discrepancies or missing information.

#### **Pool**
- **Organization**: Contains all process participants within the following lanes:
  - **Lane: Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)** - Mary
  - **Lane: Purchasing Officer** - Dan
  - **Lane: Department Manager** - Carlos
  - **Lane: Accounts Payable Supervisor (AP Supervisor)** - Rita
  - **Lane: Supplier Relationship Manager** - Karen (supporting role, not directly in main flow)

#### **Start Event**
- **Event**: Invoice Received
  - **Description**: An invoice arrives via email, initiating the process.
  - **Performed by**: AP Clerk

#### **Main Sequence Flow**

##### **Lane: Accounts Payable Clerk**
1. **Task**: Check for Purchase Order (PO)
   - **Description**: Verify if the invoice includes a valid PO number.
   - **Exclusive Gateway**: Is PO present?
     - **No**: Proceed to Task: Send Back to Supplier
       - **Task**: Send Back to Supplier
         - **Description**: Email the supplier requesting more details (e.g., PO number).
         - **End Event**: Process ends for this invoice.
     - **Yes**: Proceed to Task: Log Invoice into Accounting System
2. **Task**: Log Invoice into Accounting System
   - **Description**: Enter invoice details into the system for tracking.
3. **Task**: Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department
   - **Description**: Send the invoice to Purchasing for confirmation of goods/services received.
   - **Message Flow**: Invoice sent to Purchasing Officer.

##### **Lane: Purchasing Officer**
4. **Task**: Check Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt
   - **Description**: Compare invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) with the PO and verify that goods/services were received.
   - **Exclusive Gateway**: Does invoice match PO and receipt?
     - **No**: Proceed to Task: Attempt to Resolve Discrepancy
       - **Task**: Attempt to Resolve Discrepancy
         - **Description**: Contact the supplier for clarification or correction, potentially involving the Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) for support.
         - **Exclusive Gateway**: Is discrepancy resolved?
           - **Yes**: Proceed to Task: Send Confirmation to AP
           - **No**: Proceed to Task: Escalate to AP Supervisor
     - **Yes**: Proceed to Task: Send Confirmation to AP
5. **Task**: Send Confirmation to AP
   - **Description**: Email confirmation to AP Clerk that the invoice aligns with the PO and receipt.
   - **Message Flow**: Confirmation sent to AP Clerk.

##### **Lane: Accounts Payable Clerk**
6. **Task**: Prepare Invoice for Manager Approval
   - **Description**: Process the confirmed invoice in the system to trigger an approval request (e.g., automatic email notification to the manager).
   - **Note**: Mary mentions matching invoice line items against the PO after confirmation, which may overlap with Purchasing’s check. Here, it’s interpreted as a final verification or system preparation step.

##### **Lane: Department Manager**
7. **Task**: Review Invoice
   - **Description**: Review invoice details, PO, and Purchasing’s confirmation in the system.
   - **Exclusive Gateway**: Approve invoice?
     - **Yes**: Proceed via Message Flow: Approval Notification to AP
       - **Message Flow**: Approval notification sent to AP Clerk.
     - **No**: Proceed via Message Flow: Rejection Notification to AP
       - **Message Flow**: Rejection notification sent to AP Clerk.

##### **Lane: Accounts Payable Clerk**
8. **Exclusive Gateway**: Based on Manager’s Decision
   - **If Approved**:
     - **Task**: Schedule Invoice for Payment
       - **Description**: Add the invoice to the next payment cycle.
       - **End Event**: Process ends (invoice approved and scheduled).
   - **If Rejected**:
     - **Task**: Investigate Further
       - **Description**: Investigate discrepancies or suspicious items, potentially involving the AP Supervisor or Purchasing.
       - **End Event**: Process ends (invoice not approved, pending further action).
       - **Note**: Investigation could loop back to earlier steps (e.g., re-forward to Purchasing), but this is not explicitly detailed and is left as an end point for simplicity.

#### **Exception Handling**

##### **Lane: Accounts Payable Supervisor**
- **Task**: Handle Exception
  - **Trigger**: Escalated from Purchasing Officer when a discrepancy cannot be resolved.
  - **Description**: Coordinate resolution by contacting suppliers, working with department heads to create a retrospective PO (e.g., for informal services), or deciding to reject the invoice.
  - **Next Step**: After resolution, return the invoice to Purchasing Officer for re-checking.
    - **Message Flow**: Resolved invoice sent back to Purchasing.
  - **Note**: Rita indicates that resolved exceptions re-enter the normal flow (Purchasing confirmation → Manager approval → Payment scheduling).

##### **Lane: Supplier Relationship Manager**
- **Supporting Role**: Assist with Supplier Issues
  - **Description**: Provide support during discrepancy resolution (e.g., contacting suppliers for missing POs or pricing clarification) when looped in by Purchasing or AP.
  - **Note**: Karen’s involvement is ad-hoc and not a distinct task in the main flow.

#### **Artifacts/Data Objects**
- **Invoice**: Primary document flowing through the process.
- **Purchase Order (PO)**: Referenced for validation and matching.
- **Confirmation Email**: Sent from Purchasing to AP to confirm receipt and invoice accuracy.
- **Approval/Rejection Notification**: System-generated message from Manager to AP.
- **Payment Schedule**: Output document/schedule updated by AP Clerk.

#### **Notes on Variations and Ambiguities**
- **Overlap in Matching**: Mary mentions matching invoice line items against the PO after Purchasing’s confirmation, while Dan describes checking quantities and prices. This suggests potential redundancy. The model assumes Purchasing confirms receipt and checks details, with AP’s “matching” as a final verification or system entry step.
- **Post-Rejection Flow**: Carlos mentions rejection triggers investigation by AP, but the next steps are unclear. The model ends the process after investigation for simplicity, though a rework loop could exist.
- **Exception Resolution**: Rita’s handling of exceptions (e.g., retrospective POs) re-enters the main flow, assumed here to return to Purchasing for re-confirmation.
