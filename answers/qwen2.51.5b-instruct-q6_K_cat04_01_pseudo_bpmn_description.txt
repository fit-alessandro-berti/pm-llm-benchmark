The given pseudo-BPMN representation describes a process for handling customer requests in an enterprise environment, including aspects of validation, approval, and customization management. Let's break down each part:

### Purpose of Each Step

1. **Start Event**: This represents the beginning or initial stage of the request processing.
2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**: The actual receipt of a customer request is captured here.
3. **Gateway (XOR) Check Request Type**: After receiving the request, this gate allows for two different paths based on whether the request is standard or custom:
   - If the type is **standard**, the flow continues to Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation".
   - If the type is **custom**, a new path begins with Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis".
4. **Task B1/Task B2**: These tasks are part of different validation and analysis processes for standard or custom requests, ensuring they meet certain criteria.
5. **Gateway (AND) Run Parallel Checks**:
   - After passing through the validation steps, this step is reached when either a **standard** or a **custom** request has been processed successfully. It allows two additional tasks to be run simultaneously: Task C1: "Credit Check" and Task C2: "Inventory Check".
6. **Join**: This indicates that both tasks have completed.
7. **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**: Once the parallel checks are complete, this task calculates when the delivery date should occur.
8. **Task E1/E2**:
   - **If Type = Standard**, Task E1 ("Prepare Custom Quotation") is selected if a custom request has been identified earlier in the process.
   - If Type = Custom, Task E2 ("Send Rejection Notice") happens instead because no customization was necessary.
9. **End Event**: Indicates that all steps associated with this specific path are completed.
10. **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**:
    - This task represents the request for managerial approval on either a standard or custom basis, allowing further validation if necessary before moving to Task G: "Generate Final Invoice".
11. **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**:
    - If no manager approval is granted ("No Approval Needed"), this loop back to Task E2 (for Custom Path) or Task D (for Standard Path).
    - The process reverts to Step 3, where either a standard request or a custom analysis can be performed again.
12. **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**:
    - If approved by the manager ("Approval Needed"), Task G is executed to generate the final invoice for both standard and custom requests.
13. **Task F/G**: These tasks lead to different outcomes based on whether approval was needed or not, ensuring that all conditions are met before moving forward with an action like generating a final invoice.

### How Different Paths Converge/Loop Back

- **From Standard Path**:
  - After receiving the request (Start Event), validation checks begin. If they pass, parallel checks run concurrently.
  - Once completed, calculations for the delivery date are done.
  - Depending on whether additional approval was needed or not, different tasks follow through to either Task G ("Generate Final Invoice") or back to Task E1/Task D depending on a custom request.

- **From Custom Path**:
  - Similar initial setup but starting with different paths (Custom path).
  - Validation and parallel checks are performed similarly.
  - Calculations for the delivery date occur here as well, leading back to either Task G or Task E2 based on whether additional approval is required.

### How Tasks Differ Based on Standard/Custom

- **Standard Path**:
  - The standard validation ensures all necessary criteria are met before starting parallel checks and calculating a delivery date.
  - If the custom analysis (Task B1) indicates customization, it leads to Task E1 for preparing a quotation if required.

- **Custom Path**:
  - Custom requests undergo their own set of validations (Task B2).
  - After validating and checking the feasibility of customization, this path leads directly through Task C1/Task D without additional validation checks or parallel tasks that occur on the standard path.
  - If approval is not required ("No Approval Needed"), it goes straight to generating a final invoice.

### How Approvals/Re-work Steps are Triggers

- **Managerial Approval**:
  - For both standard and custom requests, if no manager's approval was granted, they loop back to Step 3 (re-evaluate conditions).
    - If the re-evaluation confirms that another request of either type needs a validation or additional checks before being processed further.
  
- **Custom Path Evaluation**:
  - When Task E2 ("Send Rejection Notice") is executed for a custom path, it signifies that no customization was possible. This directly leads to generating a final invoice (Task G).

This pseudo-BPMN structure ensures the process can adapt and optimize depending on whether a request is standard or custom while maintaining clear paths through validation, parallel checks, calculations, and approvals/management inputs.
