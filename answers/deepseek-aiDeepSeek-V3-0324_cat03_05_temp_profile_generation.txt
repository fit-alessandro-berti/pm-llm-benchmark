Here’s a Python dictionary representing a **temporal profile** for the given global supply chain process. The values are estimated based on typical industrial practices, with reasonable assumptions about average times and variability:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Supplier-related activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 14400),      # 1 day ± 4 hours (negotiation delays)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 172800),   # 2 weeks ± 2 days (supplier lead time)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1296000, 180000),   # ~15 days ± 2.1 days (SS to RC)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (14400, 3600),       # 4 hours ± 1 hour (inspection setup)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (1224000, 172800),   # ~14 days ± 2 days (OP to QI)
    
    # Manufacturing and testing
    ('QI', 'CA'): (28800, 7200),       # 8 hours ± 2 hours (inspection to assembly)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (43200, 10800),      # 12 hours ± 3 hours (assembly to testing)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (72000, 18000),      # 20 hours ± 5 hours (QI to PT)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 3600),       # 4 hours ± 1 hour (testing to packaging)
    
    # Logistics and after-sales
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 1800),        # 2 hours ± 30 mins (packaging to storage)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),     # 3 days ± 1 day (storage to distribution)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 259200),    # 1 week ± 3 days (distribution to after-sales)
    
    # Cross-stage pairs
    ('SS', 'PT'): (1382400, 216000),   # ~16 days ± 2.5 days (SS to PT)
    ('OP', 'PK'): (1339200, 216000),   # ~15.5 days ± 2.5 days (OP to PK)
    ('RC', 'DT'): (1209600, 259200),   # ~14 days ± 3 days (RC to DT)
    ('CA', 'AS'): (1209600, 302400),   # ~14 days ± 3.5 days (CA to AS)
}
```

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Supplier Lead Times**: Procurement steps (`SS` to `RC`) have high variability due to external dependencies.
2. **Manufacturing**: Assembly and testing delays scale with product complexity.
3. **Logistics**: Storage and distribution times depend on warehouse/delivery network efficiency.
4. **After-Sales**: Long-tail distribution due to unpredictable customer needs.

### Notes:
- Times are in **seconds** (e.g., 86400 = 1 day).
- Standard deviations reflect real-world unpredictability (e.g., supplier delays, testing failures).
- Pairs like `('SS', 'AS')` are omitted for brevity but can be derived by summing intermediate steps.
