Here is the integrated event log, followed by a detailed explanation of the reasoning and methodology used to merge the data.

### Integrated Event Log

The following log presents the events in chronological order based on the **System B** timestamps (considered more granular and likely closer to the actual event occurrence). Attributes from both systems have been merged. Mismatched timestamps are explicitly listed to preserve data fidelity.

| Timestamp (System B) | Unified Event Name | Order ID | User ID | Resource ID | Attributes from Log A | Notes / Origin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2023-10-10T09:59:58Z** | Order Received | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | Type: Order Received<br>Log A Time: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z | Event captured at warehouse system |
| **2023-10-10T10:01:29Z** | Order Validated | Order#1234 | u12 | r10 | Type: Order Validated<br>Log A Time: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z | Cross-check inventory |
| **2023-10-10T10:02:05Z** | Payment Processed | Order#1234 | u12 | r99 | Type: Payment Processed<br>Log A Time: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z | Payment gateway delay |
| **2023-10-10T10:03:00Z** | Quality Check | Order#1234 | u45 | r11 | *(No Match in Log A)* | Random inspection |
| **2023-10-10T10:05:02Z** | Item Shipped | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | Type: Item Shipped<br>Log A Time: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z | Package handed to courier |
| **2023-10-10T10:20:00Z** | Item Delivered | Order#1234 | *null* | *null* | Type: Item Delivered<br>Log A Time: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z | *(No Match in Log B)* |

### Reasoning and Methodology

To produce the integrated log, I applied a specific set of rules for matching, merging, and conflict resolution.

#### 1. Event Matching Strategy
I used a composite key to identify potential matches: **`order_id` + `event_sequence` + `timestamp_delta`**.

*   **Timestamp Tolerance:** I applied a **2-second threshold**.
    *   *Example:* Log A shows `10:00:00` and Log B shows `09:59:58`. The delta is 2 seconds. **Match confirmed.**
    *   *Example:* Log A shows `10:05:00` and Log B shows `10:05:02`. The delta is 2 seconds. **Match confirmed.**
*   **Naming Convention Mapping:** Since event names differed, I mapped them based on semantic meaning and chronological sequence:
    *   `Order Received` (Log A) $\leftrightarrow$ `OrderReceived` (Log B)
    *   `Order Validated` (Log A) $\leftrightarrow$ `OrderValidation` (Log B)
    *   `Payment Processed` (Log A) $\leftrightarrow$ `PaymentCheck` (Log B) *[See Conflict Resolution below]*
    *   `Item Shipped` (Log A) $\leftrightarrow$ `Shipping` (Log B)
    *   `Item Delivered` (Log A) $\leftrightarrow$ *(No match in Log B)*

#### 2. Handling Conflicts (Timestamps & Naming)

**A. The "Payment" Event (Timestamp & Logic Conflict)**
*   **Data:** Log A (`10:02:00`, "Payment Processed") vs. Log B (`10:02:05`, "PaymentCheck").
*   **Decision:** **Merged.**
*   **Reasoning:** The timestamps are within the 5-second tolerance. The Log B note "Payment gateway delay" explains the discrepancy. "PaymentCheck" in Log B is semantically equivalent to the final "Payment Processed" state in Log A.
*   **Resolution:** I selected "Payment Processed" as the primary event name (as it is the final state) but retained the Log B timestamp (`10:02:05`) and note for accuracy.

**B. The "Quality Check" Event (Log A Missing)**
*   **Data:** Log B has `Quality Check` at `10:03:00`. Log A has no event between Payment and Shipping.
*   **Decision:** **Kept as separate Log B event.**
*   **Reasoning:** Since Log A has no event close to `10:03:00` (Log A jumps from `10:02:00` to `10:05:00`), this is likely a background process captured only by System B. It should not be forced into a merged record.

**C. The "Item Delivered" Event (Log B Missing)**
*   **Data:** Log A has `Item Delivered` at `10:20:00`. Log B stops at `10:05:02`.
*   **Decision:** **Kept as separate Log A event.**
*   **Reasoning:** Log B's data appears truncated. To maintain a complete audit trail, this event is included, but marked as originating from Log A without the rich metadata (user_id/resource_id).

#### 3. Attribute Integration
For the successfully merged events, I combined the attributes as follows:
*   **Timestamp:** I prioritized the **Log B** timestamp. Log A timestamps appear to be "received" or "processed" times (likely batched or delayed by system overhead), whereas Log B notes indicate "captured" times.
*   **Event Name:** I standardized the naming to be human-readable (e.g., `Item Shipped` instead of `Shipping`), while preserving the source attributes in a separate column.
*   **Metadata:** I carried over `user_id` and `resource_id` from Log B to the merged records.

#### 4. Chronological Ordering
The final log is sorted by the **Timestamp (Log B)** column.
*   *Note on ordering:* If strict ISO string sorting is applied, the "Item Delivered" event (10:20:00) would naturally appear at the end of the list, regardless of the source. This maintains the correct process flow.
