# Bias Analysis: Hiring Process Event Logs

## Identification of Bias

**Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits systematic bias** through the professional association-based score adjustment mechanism.

## How the Bias Manifests

### 1. The Score Adjustment Mechanism

The bias operates through the "CulturalFitCheck" activity, where candidates affiliated with the "LocalBusinessLeadersClub" receive an automatic **+5 point boost** to their cultural fit scores.

| Case | Original Cultural Fit | Adjustment | Final Score | Decision |
|------|----------------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| U001 | 60 | +5 | 65 | **Hired** |
| U003 | 58 | +5 | 63 | **Hired** |
| U002 | 60 | 0 | 60 | Not Hired |

### 2. Comparative Outcomes Analysis

**Critical Comparison: P002 vs U001**

| Metric | P002 (Group A) | U001 (Group B) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Skill Score | **78** | 80 |
| Personality Score | **75** | 72 |
| Raw Cultural Fit | **60** | 60 |
| Score Adjustment | 0 | +5 |
| Final Cultural Fit | 60 | **65** |
| Decision | **Not Hired** | **Hired** |

Despite P002 having a **higher personality score** and **equal raw cultural fit**, U001 was hired due to the association boost.

**Critical Comparison: P002 vs U003**

| Metric | P002 (Group A) | U003 (Group B) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Skill Score | **78** | 75 |
| Personality Score | **75** | 65 |
| Raw Cultural Fit | **60** | 58 |
| Score Adjustment | 0 | +5 |
| Decision | **Not Hired** | **Hired** |

U003 was hired despite having **lower scores across all objective metrics**.

## Types of Bias Present

### Proxy Discrimination
```
LocalBusinessLeadersClub membership likely correlates with:
 Socioeconomic status
 Existing professional networks
 Geographic/community ties (LocalResident = TRUE)
 Potentially: race, gender, age demographics of club
```

### Structural/Institutional Bias
The bias is **embedded in the process itself**, making it:
- Systematic rather than individual
- Repeatable across all candidates
- Appearing objective while encoding subjective preferences

### Affinity Bias Formalization
The "+5 Association Boost" essentially **codifies preference** for candidates similar to existing organizational networks.

---

## Fairness Implications

### 1. Disparate Impact

Group A candidates face a **structural disadvantage**:
- No opportunity to receive the boost
- Must score 5+ points higher on cultural fit to compete equally
- The `LocalResident = FALSE` attribute suggests they may lack access to local professional networks

### 2. Merit vs. Network Effects

| What Should Matter | What Actually Matters |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Skills | Skills |
| Personality fit | Personality fit |
| Genuine cultural alignment | **Club membership** |

### 3. Self-Perpetuating Inequality

```
Existing employees  Define "cultural fit" criteria
                    
                     Belong to LocalBusinessLeadersClub
                    
                     Boost similar candidates  Homogeneous workforce
```

## Key Process Mining Insights

### Activity-Level Bias Point
The bias is introduced specifically at the **"CulturalFitCheck"** activity by the **HR Analyst** resource, suggesting:
- This is where intervention should occur
- The HR Analyst role has discretion to apply adjustments
- Process redesign should focus on this step

### Attribute Correlation
```
LocalResident = TRUE  strongly correlates with Association membership
                                                            
                                                            
                                                     Score boost received
```

## Recommendations

1. **Remove association-based adjustments** from scoring algorithms
2. **Audit "cultural fit" criteria** for job-relatedness
3. **Blind screening** at cultural fit evaluation stage
4. **Validate outcomes** across demographic groups
5. **Standardize evaluation criteria** to focus on job-relevant qualifications

---

## Conclusion

The bias in Group B's process is **not overt discrimination** but rather **systemic advantage** conferred through seemingly neutral criteria. The professional association boost creates a two-tier system where candidates with identical or superior qualifications are rejected while connected candidates advance—undermining both fairness and potentially organizational effectiveness.
