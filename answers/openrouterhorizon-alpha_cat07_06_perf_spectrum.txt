This is a timeline-based process visualization showing three event types and how individual cases move between them.

- The horizontal axis is time (from 2000 to 2013).
- The three labeled horizontal bands are process states: “Send Fine” (top), “Insert Fine Notification” (middle) and “Send for Credit Collection” (bottom).
- Each thin line represents one case instance. Vertical gray strokes in the top band mark occurrences of “Send Fine.”
- Slanted lines connect events for the same case as it progresses over time:
  - From the top band down to the middle band (Send Fine  Insert Fine Notification).
  - Then further down to the bottom band ( Send for Credit Collection).
- The red/pink lines highlight particular paths or longer durations; darker red indicates stronger emphasis/longer gaps, lighter pink indicates others.

Overall, the figure shows dense activity of “Send Fine” throughout the period, followed by many cases that eventually receive a fine notification and, after varying delays, a subset that are sent for credit collection. The long downward slants indicate substantial delays between steps for many cases.
