## Analysis of Order Event Log Anomalies and Proposed SQL Queries

Based on the provided event log data, several anomalies and potentially undesirable behaviors can be identified. Here's a breakdown of the anomalies, potential hypotheses, and corresponding SQL queries to investigate.

**Anomaly 1: Order 1004 - Confirm Shipment Event Without Prior Shipment Scheduling**

* **Observation:** Order 1004 has a "Confirm Shipment" event (event_id 25) occurring *before* the "Confirm Shipment" event (event_id 4) which indicates shipment scheduling. This deviates from the assumed process flow.
* **Hypothesis:**
    * **System Error:** A bug in the system might be causing events to be logged out of sequence.
    * **Manual Override:** A user might have manually confirmed shipment before the logistics team formally scheduled it.
    * **Data Entry Error:** The timestamp or event order might be incorrect in the log.
* **SQL Queries:**
    1. Find all order events where "Confirm Shipment" occurs before "Confirm Shipment" with a scheduled status:
       ```sql
       SELECT *
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
       AND timestamp < (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = 1004 AND activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND additional_info LIKE '%shipment_scheduled=Y%');
       ```
    2. Examine the resource performing the "Confirm Shipment" event for order 1004:
       ```sql
       SELECT *
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE case_id = 1004 AND event_id = 25;
       ```
    3. Check for any other related events around the time of the anomaly for order 1004:
       ```sql
       SELECT *
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE case_id = 1004
       ORDER BY timestamp;
       ```

**Anomaly 2: Order 1003 - Late Shipment Confirmation**

* **Observation:** Order 1003 has a "Confirm Shipment" event (event_id 19) with `late_confirmation=Y`. This suggests a delay in the confirmation process.
* **Hypothesis:**
    * **Logistical Bottleneck:** There might be a temporary overload or issue in the logistics department.
    * **System Delay:** The system might have experienced a delay in updating the shipment confirmation status.
    * **Policy Violation:** The system might have flagged a potentially late confirmation based on predefined rules.
* **SQL Queries:**
    1. Find all orders with late shipment confirmations:
       ```sql
       SELECT DISTINCT case_id
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND additional_info LIKE '%late_confirmation=Y%';
       ```
    2. Investigate the timeline of events for order 1003 leading up to the late confirmation:
       ```sql
       SELECT *
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE case_id = 1003
       ORDER BY timestamp
       LIMIT 20;
       ```
    3. Determine the typical time frame for shipment confirmation for similar orders (requires analyzing historical data - this query provides a starting point).
       ```sql
       SELECT AVG(timestamp - MIN(timestamp)) AS average_time_to_confirm
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
       AND timestamp BETWEEN (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Register Order' AND case_id = 1003) AND (SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND case_id = 1003);
       ```

**Anomaly 3: Order 1004 - Order Received Payment Before Confirmation Shipment**

* **Observation:** Order 1004 has a "Receive Payment" event (event_id 22) occurring before the "Confirm Shipment" event (event_id 25) and "Ship Goods" event (event_id 25). This is unexpected as payment typically precedes shipment.
* **Hypothesis:**
    * **Payment Processing Delay:** The payment might have been processed faster than the logistics confirmation.
    * **System Integration Issue:** There might be a delay in the system updating the order status after payment.
    * **Manual Payment Recording:** The payment might have been recorded manually before the shipment was confirmed.
* **SQL Queries:**
    1. List all orders where payment is received before shipment confirmation:
       ```sql
       SELECT *
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
       AND timestamp < (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = 1004 AND activity = 'Confirm Shipment');
       ```
    2. Examine the resources involved in the payment and shipment confirmation for order 1004:
       ```sql
       SELECT *
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE case_id = 1004
       AND (activity = 'Receive Payment' OR activity = 'Confirm Shipment');
       ```
    3. Compare the timestamps of payment and shipment events for order 1004:
       ```sql
       SELECT 'Payment Before Shipment' AS anomaly,
              p.timestamp AS payment_timestamp,
              s.timestamp AS shipment_timestamp,
              o.case_id
       FROM order_event_log p
       JOIN order_event_log s ON p.case_id = s.case_id AND p.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND s.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
       WHERE p.case_id = 1004
       AND p.timestamp < s.timestamp;
       ```

**Anomaly 4: Order 1004 - Order Received Payment without Invoice Issuance**

* **Observation:** Order 1004 has a "Receive Payment" event (event_id 22) before the "Issue Invoice" event (event_id 23).  This violates the expected order flow.
* **Hypothesis:**
    * **System Error:**  A system error might have prevented the invoice from being generated and logged.
    * **Manual Invoice Processing:** The invoice might have been issued and paid manually, bypassing the system log.
    * **Data Entry Error:** The invoice event might have been missed or logged incorrectly.
* **SQL Queries:**
    1. List all orders where payment is received before invoice is issued:
       ```sql
       SELECT *
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
       AND timestamp < (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = 1004 AND activity = 'Issue Invoice');
       ```
    2. Check the logs for the FinanceTeam members involved in order 1004:
       ```sql
       SELECT *
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE case_id = 1004
       AND resource IN (SELECT resource FROM resources WHERE department = 'Finance');
       ```

These are just initial investigations based on the limited data provided. Further analysis, including correlation with data from other tables (like `orders` and `resources`) and a longer historical dataset, would be necessary to confirm these hypotheses and understand the root causes of these anomalies.
