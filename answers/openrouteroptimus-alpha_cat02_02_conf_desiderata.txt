Let's systematically analyze the process log according to the **strict normative constraints** (Part 1) and **desiderata (best practice)** recommendations (Part 2):

---

## 1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Constraints)

### **Case 1**
| Activity Sequence: | Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case |

- **Check:**
  - All required activities are present.
  - No activity is skipped.
  - Order is correct.
  - For "Approved": Finalize Documentation occurs before Close Case.
- **Conclusion:**  
  **No normative violations.**

---

### **Case 2**
| Activity Sequence:  
  Application Received  Risk Assessment  Credit Check  Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case |

- **Violations:**
  1. **Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check**  
     - Violates: "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."
  2. **Finalize Documentation performed after a Rejection**  
     - Violates: "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."
  3. **Ordering Problem**  
     - The sequence is out of the prescribed order.
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Normative violations present:**
    - Step out of order (Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
    - Finalize Documentation after rejection (not allowed).

---

### **Case 3**
| Activity Sequence:  
  Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case |

- **Check:**
  - All required activities are present.
  - Correct order.
  - For "Approved": Finalize Documentation occurs before Close Case.
- **Conclusion:**  
  **No normative violations.**  
  (All required steps, correct order, conditions followed.)

## 2. Desiderata Violations (Best Practice Recommendations)

### **Desiderata (Best Practices) Checklist:**
- **Credit Check** within 24 hours of Application Received.
- **Inform Applicant** within 48 hours of Loan Decision.
- **Follow-up Call** performed before Close Case (optional/desideratum).

---

### **Case 1**
- **Credit Check is** 30 minutes after Application Received.  
  *(Within 24 hours – OK)*
- **Inform Applicant** is 2 hours after Loan Decision.  
  *(Within 48 hours – OK)*
- **No explicit Follow-up Call, but not specified as expected.*  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **No desiderata violations.**

---

### **Case 2**
- **Risk Assessment** performed before Credit Check, but that's a **normative violation** (already noted).
- **Assuming we only look at the timing/desiderata:**
  - **Credit Check** is at 09:00, Application Received at 08:00 – 1 hour later (OK).
  - **Inform Applicant** step is missing; instead, loan is rejected and Finalize Documentation is performed (which is also a normative violation).
  - **No evidence for Inform Applicant or Follow-up Call.**
- **Conclusion:**  
  - **Potential desiderata violation: "Inform Applicant" absent.**  However, in the strict sequence, rejection should still be communicated.
  - **No Follow-up Call prior to close.**
- **But since there is a normative violation, desiderata are secondary in this case.**

---

### **Case 3**
- **Credit Check**:  
  Application Received: 2024-01-12 09:00  
  Credit Check:      2024-01-14 10:00  
  Time lag: ~49 hours (more than 24 hours)  
  ** Violates "Credit Check within 24 hours" desideratum.**
- **Inform Applicant:**  
  Loan Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00  
  Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00  
  Time lag: 51 hours (more than 48 hours)  
  ** Violates "Inform Applicant within 48 hours" desideratum.**
- **No Follow-up Call event recorded before Close Case.**  
  ** Skipped optional Follow-up Call (a desideratum).**
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Desiderata violations:**  
  - Credit Check performed later than recommended.  
  - Inform Applicant later than recommended.  
  - Skipped Follow-up Call.  
  *(None of these are serious violations, but they're noted as suboptimal.)*

## 3. Interpretations and Possible Justifications

**Case 1:**  
- **Interpretation:** Model case. Both strict and best-practice recommendations are followed.  
- **No justifications needed.**

---

**Case 2:**  
- **Normative violations likely indicate either process error or log recording mistake:**
  - Performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check might mean a data entry or procedural error, or perhaps an urgency that overrode normal sequence.
  - Finalizing documentation after a rejection likely indicates misunderstanding of the process rules or a mistake; perhaps an attempt to record final correspondence, but according to normative constraints, this is not allowed.
- **Desiderata:** Inform Applicant is missing, and skipped Follow-up Call—could be due to the rejection making further steps seem unnecessary, but best practice would be to inform the applicant.

---

**Case 3:**  
- **Desiderata only:** Delays may be justified by workload, applicant unavailability, technical issues, or waiting for additional information.
  - Skipping Follow-up Call may reflect resource constraints or judgment that it's not needed.
- **But as long as the strict sequence is followed, these are just 'suboptimal' and not violations.**

## **Summary Table**

| Case | Normative Violation? | Reason                                         | Desiderata Missed?                 | Details                                       |
|------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1    | No                   | -                                              | No                                 | -                                             |
| 2    | **Yes**              | Risk Assessment before Credit Check, Finalizing after rejection | Possibly ("Inform Applicant" missing, no Follow-up Call) | See above                                    |
| 3    | No                   | -                                              | **Yes**                            | Credit Check >24h, Inform Applicant >48h, no Follow-up Call |

## **Summary Statements**

1. **Normative violations:**  
   - **Case 2** violates the strict process sequence (incorrect ordering, not allowed finalization after rejection).

2. **Desiderata violations (non-strict):**  
   - **Case 3** has delays in completing activities and misses the optional follow-up call.  
   - **Case 2** and **Case 3** also do not perform a follow-up call, but this is just 'suboptimal'.
   
3. **Interpretations:**  
   - Normative violations in Case 2 may stem from data entry or process mistakes or urgent exceptions, but are not permitted by policy.  
   - Desiderata delays likely reflect operational realities and are not cause for concern, though the process could be improved for efficiency and customer experience.

---

**Conclusion:**  
- **Case 2** is problematic and violates required rules.  
- **Case 3** could be improved but does not break any crucial process requirement.  
- **Case 1** is fully compliant and exemplary.
