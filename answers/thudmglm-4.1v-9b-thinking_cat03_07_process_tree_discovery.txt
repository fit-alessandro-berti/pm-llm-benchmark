<answer>To solve this problem, we need to construct a process tree that captures the observed behavior from the given event log. The process involves balancing fitness (capturing repeated activities), precision (capturing the sequence of activities), and simplicity (using standard operators). The key observations from the event log are:  
- A sequence of initial activities: `Receive Application (RA)  Validate Form (VF)  Assess Eligibility (AE)`,  
- A loop for `Request Missing Info (RMI)` with optional repetitions (up to 2 times in this log),  
- A sequence leading to final activities: `Approval Decision (AD)  Send Confirmation (SC)  Archive Case (AC)`.  


### Approach  
1. **Identify the Initial Sequence**: The first three activities (`RA`, `VF`, `AE`) are executed sequentially. This forms the starting part of the process.  
2. **Model the Loop for Repeated Activities**: After `AE`, there are repeated `RMI` activities (zero
