Okay, I need to tackle this problem step by step. Let me start by understanding the task. The user has given me an event log for customer support tickets and wants me to figure out which cases are taking too long, why, and suggest improvements. Alright, let me go through the data first.

First, I need to look at each case's timeline. The total resolution time is from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket". Let me list out each case's start and end times to calculate the duration. 

Starting with Case 101. The receive time is 2024-03-01 08:00, and close is 10:15 the same day. So that's 2 hours and 15 minutes. That seems pretty quick. 

Case 102: Received at 08:05 on the 1st and closed at 09:15 on the 2nd. Let's see, from 08:05 to 08:15 next day would be 24 hours and 10 minutes. Wait, but the close is on the 2nd at 09:15, so total is 25 hours and 10 minutes. That's way longer than 101. 

Case 103: Received at 08:10 on the 1st, closed at 09:30 the same day. Let's calculate that. From 08:10 to 09:30 is 1 hour 20 minutes. Very quick.

Case 104: Received at 08:20 on the 1st, closed at 08:30 on the 2nd. So that's about 24 hours and 10 minutes. Hmm, similar to 102.

Case 105: Received at 08:25 on the 1st, closed at 09:30 on the 3rd. That's over two days. Let me compute that. From March 1st 08:25 to March 3rd 09:30. That's 49 hours and 5 minutes. That's way longer than the others.

So, looking at the total durations:

- 101: ~2h15m
- 102: ~25h10m
- 103: ~1h20m
- 104: ~24h10m
- 105: ~49h5m

Comparing these, cases 102, 104, and especially 105 are taking way longer than 101 and 103. So the significantly longer ones are 102, 104, 105. The average of the others is maybe around 2 hours, so those three are outliers.

Now, to find out why. Let's look at each of these cases in detail.

Starting with Case 102:

Activities:

- Receive (8:05), Triage (8:30) – that's 25 minutes. Then assign to Level-1 at 9:00, which is 30 minutes after triage. Then investigate starts at 11:30? Wait no, between assign and investigate: Assign at 9:00, then next activity is escalate to Level-2 at 11:30. Wait, hold on. Wait, the log shows for case 102: after Assign to Level-1 at 9:00, next activity is Escalate to Level-2 at 11:30. Wait, so between Assign and Escalate there's a gap? Let me check the log again for case 102:

Looking at the table for case 102:

- After Assign to Level-1 Agent at 9:00, the next event is Escalate to Level-2 at 11:30. So between 9:00 and 11:30 that's 2.5 hours. Why the escalation? Maybe the Level-1 couldn't handle it, so they escalated. The investigation after escalation is at 14:00 (2 PM). Wait, the escalate step was at 11:30, then investigation by Level-2 starts at 14:00. So between escalate and investigate is 2.5 hours? Then the investigation takes until 14:00, then resolve the next day at 9:00. So the investigate to resolve is 18 hours? Wait, let's parse the timeline again for case 102:

Case 102:
- 8:05 Receive
- 8:30 Triage (25 mins)
- 9:00 Assign to Level-1 (30 mins after triage)
- Then, next step is Escalate to Level-2 at 11:30. So between Assign and Escalate: 2.5 hours. Maybe the Level-1 agent took a long time before escalating? Then after escalation, the investigation starts at 14:00 (3 hours later). Maybe waiting for Level-2 to pick it up? Then investigation ends when? The next step after investigation is at 14:00 (investigate issue), then resolve at 9:00 next day. So from 14:00 to 9:00 next day is 19 hours. That's a long time. Hmm. So the problem here might be the time between escalate and investigate, but actually the investigation to resolve is taking a day. Maybe the Level-2 team is slow? Or there's a delay after investigation. 

Wait, let me break down each case's activities with times between steps.

Case 102's total time is 25h10m. Let me see the steps:

Receive (8:05) -> Triage (8:30) – 25m. Then Assign (9:00) – 30m after triage. Then until escalate is 2.5 hours (from 9:00 to 11:30). So from assign to escalate: 2.5 hours. Then escalate to investigate: 14:00 is 2.5 hours after escalate. So from escalate to investigate is 2.5 hours. Then investigation starts at 14:00, then the next step is resolve at 9:00 next day (March 2nd 9:00). So that's 19 hours? Wait, from 14:00 to 24:00 is 10 hours, plus 9 hours next day? Total 19 hours? That's a long time for investigation to resolution. Then resolve to close is 15 mins. So the major delay here is between investigation and resolve. That's a big chunk.

Case 104: 

Case 104's timeline:

Receive at 8:20, close at 8:30 next day (March 2nd 08:30). So total time is 24h10m. Let's look at the steps:

Receive (8:20) -> Triage at 9:00 (40 minutes). Then Assign at 9:30 (30 minutes later). Then investigate starts at 13:00 (4 hours after assign). Wait, assign at 9:30, then next activity is investigate at 13:00 (4 hours later?). Wait, no, looking at the log for case 104, the steps are:

After Assign to Level-1 Agent at 9:30, the next step is Investigate Issue at 13:00. So that's 3.5 hours (from 9:30 to 13:00 is 3.5 hours). Then after Investigation, they resolve on March 2nd 8:00. Wait, so from investigate (13:00 on 1st) to resolve is next day at 8:00. That's 19 hours. So again, a big gap between investigation and resolve. Then resolve to close is 30 mins. So the major delay is between investigation and resolve. Hmm, similar to case 102. 

Case 105 is even worse. Let's check that:

Case 105: 

Received 8:25, closed 3/3 9:30. That's over two days. Breaking down:

Receive at 8:25, triage at 8:35 (10 mins). Then assign at 9:00 (25 mins). Then investigate at 9:10 (10 mins after assign. Then escalate at 10:00. Wait, after investigate, they escalate? Wait, the log shows after investigate at 9:10, then escalate at 10:00. So between investigate and escalate is 50 minutes. Then escalate to Level-2, then next activity is investigate again on March 2nd at 14:00. Wait, that's a big gap. From escalate at 10:00 on 1st to investigate again on 2nd 14:00. That's 28 hours. That's a big delay. Then after that investigate, resolve on 3rd at 9:00. So the big delays are between escalate and next investigate (28 hours), and then maybe after that. 

Wait, let me parse case 105 step by step:

Case 105's timeline:

- 8:25 Receive
- 8:35 Triage (10m)
- 9:00 Assign (25m later)
- 9:10 Investigate (10m after Assign)
- 10:00 Escalate (50m after investigation starts? Or after investigation? Wait, the log entries are:

Case 105's events:

- After Assign (9:00), the next activity is Investigate at 9:10 (so 10 mins later), then escalate at 10:00. So after starting investigation, they escalated after 50 minutes? Or maybe the investigation took some time, then escalate. Then escalate to Level-2 at 10:00. Then the next activity is Investigate Issue again at 14:00 on the same day (March 1st?) Wait, no, looking at the log for 105:

Wait the log shows for case 105: the escalate is at 10:00 (March 1st 10:00). Then next is "Investigate Issue" at 2024-03-02 14:00. Wait, that's the next day. So from 10:00 to 14:00 next day is 28 hours? Wait, March 1st 10:00 to March 2nd 14:00 is 28 hours. That's a huge delay between escalate and the next investigate step. So that's a problem. Then after that, the investigation on the 2nd at 14:00, then resolve on the 3rd 9:00. So between investigate and resolve is 23 hours. That's another big gap. 

So the big delays in 105 are between escalate and next investigate (28h), then investigate to resolve (23h). So why such big gaps?

Now, the problem is to find the root causes. So for cases 102, 104, and especially 105, the main issues are long waits after escalation, or between steps.

Looking at Case 102:

After escalate (at 11:30 on 1st), next step is investigate at 14:00 (2.5 hours later). Then from investigate (14:00) to resolve next day at 9:00 is 19 hours. That's a long delay between investigation and resolve. 

Case 104:

After investigate at 13:00 on 1st March, next is resolve on the 2nd at 8:00. So from 13:00 to next day 8:00 is 19 hours. Same as 102.

Case 105's big delays are after escalate. So perhaps when a ticket is escalated, there's a delay before the Level-2 team picks it up. Like, after escalate, the Level-2 might not start the investigation immediately. In case 102, the escalate to investigate is 2.5 hours. Maybe that's okay, but in case 105 it's 28 hours. That's a big issue. 

Another possible cause is that after investigation, the resolve step is taking too long. For 102 and 104, the time between investigation and resolve is overnight. Maybe the agents are not working during off-hours, so the clock stops? Or maybe they need to work during the next day. Wait, but the total time is counted including overnights? The problem states "cycle times", so including all time, even if it's after business hours. So maybe the Level-2 team is slow to take action after escalation, especially in case 105. 

Looking at the activities:

Another possible factor is the number of escalations. Cases 102, 104, 105 have escalations. Maybe escalated cases take longer? Let's see:

Looking at the cases:

Case 101: No escalation, resolves quickly.

Case 103: No escalation, resolves quickly.

Cases with escalation (102, 104, 105) are the slow ones. So escalations might be a contributing factor, but not the only one. Because even among escalated cases, 102 and 104 have 24-25 hours, but case 105 is way longer. 

Looking at case 102:

The escalation happened at 11:30 on the 1st, then the next step is Investigate Issue at 14:00 (same day). So the escalation to investigation is 2.5 hours. Then after investigation (14:00), resolve is next day at 9:00 (19 hours). Maybe the Level-2 team works during business hours, so overnight hours count as delay. But perhaps the Level-2 team is slow. 

In case 105, after escalate to Level-2 at 10:00 on the 1st, the next step is investigate on the 2nd at 14:00. That's 28 hours between escalate and investigation. That's a huge delay. That could be the Level-2 team not starting work on it for a day and a half? That's bad. Then after that, the investigation to resolve is another 23 hours. Hmm, but maybe the investigation took until 2nd 14:00, then resolve at 3rd 9:00, so 23 hours. 

Another possible point is the time between assigning to Level-1 and escalate. Maybe the Level-1 agent took too long to escalate? For case 102: assigned to Level-1 at 9:00, then escalated at 11:30. So 2.5 hours. Maybe that's okay? Or maybe the agent spent too much time before escalating? 

Wait, in case 105: assigned to Level-1 at 9:00 (on March 1st?), then investigate starts at 9:10 (just 10 minutes after assign), then escalate at 10:00 (50 minutes later). So the Level-1 agent tried to investigate but couldn't, so escalated. But the time between escalate and the next investigation (Level-2) is 28 hours. That's a big gap.

So the main issues seem to be:

1. Long delays after escalation, particularly in cases where the Level-2 team takes too long to start working on the ticket (like case 105's 28h delay between escalate and Level-2's investigation).

2. Also, after investigation, the resolve step is taking too long. Like in case 102 and 104, the time from investigation to resolve is overnight, but maybe the team is only working during business hours, so the time is counted but no work is done. But even so, 19 hours is a long time.

Alternatively, maybe after investigation, they need to wait for more information from the customer or something, but not indicated in the log. 

Looking for other possible factors:

Looking at the steps between activities:

For example, in Case 102, between Assign (9:00) and escalate (11:30) is 2.5 hours. Maybe the Level-1 agent spent that time trying to handle it before escalating. That might be acceptable or not, but the main delays are post-escalation.

Similarly, in case 104: after assign, the investigation starts at 13:00 (4 hours after assign). But then from investigate to resolve is overnight. 

Another point: the escalation itself might be a step that requires time. But the main issue is the time between escalate and the next step (investigation by Level-2). In case 102 that's 2.5 hours, but in 105 it's 28 hours. So that's a big difference. So maybe some escalations are handled quickly, others not. 

Another possible factor: the time between the investigation and resolve. Let me check each case:

Case 101: investigate (9:00) to resolve (10:00) is 1 hour. So quick.

Case 102: investigate (14:00) to resolve (9:00 next day). 19 hours. So overnight, but if the team only works 8-5, then maybe it's just the overnight delay. But that's part of the total time.

Similarly, case 104: investigate at 13:00, resolve next day 8:00 (19 hours). Same as 102.

Case 105: investigate after escalate is on March 2nd 14:00, then resolve at 3rd 9:00, which is 23 hours. 

So the big delays are between escalate and next investigation (especially in 105) and between investigation and resolve (overnight). However, maybe the overnight times are unavoidable, but if the team isn't working nights, that's just part of the cycle time. But the 28-hour delay between escalate and investigation in case 105 is a problem. 

Another possible issue is the time between Assign and investigation. For example, in case 104, after Assign at 9:30, investigation starts at 13:00 – that's 3.5 hours. Maybe that's a delay before starting the investigation? Not sure.

Wait, in case 101, the Assign to investigation is 40 minutes (assign at 8:20, investigate starts at 9:00. So 40 mins. 

Case 102: Assign at 9:00, then escalate at 11:30. So between assign and escalate, the investigation started at 11:30 (escalate is the next step, but the actual investigation after escalation is at 14:00.

Wait, maybe the steps are: Assign to Level-1, then they start investigating, but can't, so escalate, then the Level-2 needs to take over. So the time between escalate and the next investigate step (by Level-2) is the key. In case 102, that's 2.5 hours, but in 105 it's 28 hours. So that's a huge discrepancy. 

So the root causes could be:

1. Delay in the Level-2 team responding to escalated tickets. In case 105, it took 28 hours between escalation and the Level-2 starting work on it. That's a big issue.

2. The time between investigation and resolution is overnight, which might be due to the team not working outside business hours. However, if the investigation to resolve takes 19 hours, that's a day, so maybe the Level-2 team is only working during the day, so the ticket is left overnight, leading to that delay. But that's a structural issue if they can't work outside hours. 

Alternatively, maybe the investigation step itself takes too long. Like, in case 105, after the Level-2 starts investigating on the 2nd at 14:00, then resolve on 3rd 9:00. That's 23 hours. So the investigation took from 14:00 to next day's 9:00, which is 19 hours, plus the next day's 9:00 to resolve. Wait, the log shows after investigate (2nd 14:00), then resolve is on 3rd 9:00. So the investigation itself might have taken from 14:00 on 2nd to resolve at 3rd 9:00? Or maybe the investigation step is just a single event, so the time between investigation and resolve is 23 hours. That's a long time. Maybe the Level-2 team is slow in resolving after investigation.

Alternatively, perhaps the investigation step is taking too long. 

Alternatively, maybe the process requires multiple investigations or some steps missing. 

Another point: the time between activities. For example, in case 104, after investigation at 13:00, they might not resolve until next day. 

So possible root causes:

- Delays in the Level-2 team responding to escalated tickets, especially in case 105, which had a 28h delay between escalate and investigate.

- Overnight delays between investigation and resolution, which might be due to work hours. Maybe the Level-2 team only works 8-5, so after 5 PM, it's delayed until next day. So if the investigation ends at 14:00 (2 PM), then resolve the next day at 9 AM, that's 19 hours, which is overnight. So perhaps the process can't proceed outside business hours, leading to delays. 

Another factor: the number of escalations. But 105 has an escalation, same as others. 

Another possible delay: time between Receive and Triage? Let's check:

Looking at triage times: 

Case 101: triage happened 10 minutes after receipt. Good.

Case 102: 25 minutes between receive and triage. Also quick.

Case 103: 5 minutes. 

Case 104: 40 minutes (received at 8:20, triage at 9:00). So 40 minutes. 

All are within an hour, so triage isn't the issue.

Assign is done quickly in all cases except maybe case 102's assign is at 9:00, which is 55 minutes after receive (received at 8:05, assign at 9:00. Wait, case 102 received at 8:05, triage at 8:30, then assign at 9:00 (30 mins after triage). That's okay. 

The main problem seems to be after escalation. 

So to sum up, the factors causing delays are:

1. Long delays between escalation and the Level-2 team starting work (e.g., case 105's 28h delay between escalate and Level-2's investigation).

2. Overnight delays between investigation and resolution when the team is not available, leading to overnight delays (like 19 hours between investigation and resolve in case 102 and 104).

3. Possibly the time between investigation and resolve is too long even during active hours.

Additionally, in case 105, after escalate to Level-2, the next investigate is on the same day? Wait no, case 105's escalate is on 1st at 10:00, then next activity is investigate on 2nd 14:00. That's a day and a half. That's a big delay in Level-2's response.

So the root causes are likely:

- Delays in the Level-2 team addressing escalated tickets (e.g., 28 hours in case 105). 

- Overnight delays between investigation and resolution because the team isn't working during nights.

- Maybe the Level-2 team is overburdened or slow in starting their part.

Additionally, in case 105, after escalate to Level-2, the investigation by Level-2 is delayed. So the Level-2 team isn't getting to the ticket quickly. 

Another point: the number of steps. For example, case 105 had an escalate, then after escalate they have to investigate again, adding more steps. But the time is the key.

So the main factors are:

- Escalation handling: significant delays in when Level-2 starts working on the ticket after escalation.

- Overnight delays (non-business hours) causing extended resolution times.

Additionally, maybe the time between assign and escalate is too long, but in case 105, the escalate was only 50 minutes after assigning (assigned at 9:00, escalate at 10:00. So that's okay. 

Other possible factors: Maybe some steps have long waiting times between activities. For example, in case 105, after escalate (10:00 on 1st) to the next step (investigate on 2nd 14:00) is 28 hours. That's the key issue.

So recommendations would be to ensure that escalated tickets are addressed quickly by Level-2, maybe better escalation processes or more resources for Level-2. Also, maybe after-hours coverage to reduce overnight delays, or better communication between teams to reduce the time between escalate and investigation.

Another possible cause is that after escalate, the ticket sits until the next business day, hence the delay. For instance, if the escalate happens at 10:00 on the 1st, and the next day's investigate is at 14:00, that would be 28 hours. If the business hours are 8-5, then after escalate at 10:00, maybe the Level-2 team is busy, and they don't pick it up until the next day. So maybe the Level-2 team is overworked, leading to long queues. 

So to summarize the root causes:

1. Delayed response from the Level-2 team after escalation (e.g., 28 hours in case 105).

2. Overnight delays between investigation and resolution if the process can't proceed outside business hours.

3. Possibly, after investigation, there's a long wait for resolution, which could be due to team availability.

So the recommendations would be to improve Level-2's response time, maybe by adding more staff, better prioritization, or better escalation management. Also, maybe allowing some coverage outside regular hours to reduce overnight delays. 

Also, check if there's any other steps that are taking too long. For example, in case 102, after investigation (14:00 on 1st), resolve is next day at 9:00. So if the Level-2 team works 9-5, then from 14:00 to next day 9:00 is 19 hours, which is overnight. So that's unavoidable unless they work overnight. But that's a structural issue. However, the 28-hour delay between escalate and investigation in case 105 is a clear example of the Level-2 team not acting quickly.

Another possible cause: the Level-2 team might not be addressing the escalated tickets promptly, leading to long queues. 

Additionally, in case 105, after the first investigation by Level-1, they escalated, but maybe the Level-2 team didn't start until the next day, leading to the 28-hour gap. So the Level-2 might be slow in starting their investigation once escalated.

So, to answer the user's questions:

Step 1: Identify which cases have longer times. The slowest are 102 (25h), 104 (24h), 105 (49h+). So these are the cases to look at.

Step 2: Root causes. The key points are:

- Escalations leading to long delays, especially in the time between escalate and Level-2 starting work (case 105's 28h delay here).

- Overnight delays between investigation and resolve steps, as the process can't proceed outside business hours.

- Possibly, the Level-2 team is under-resourced, leading to delays in starting work on escalated cases.

Another possible cause: In cases 102 and 105, there's an "Escalate to Level-2" step, and after that, the next step is Investigation, which might require the Level-2 team to start work. If they don't handle it quickly, it's a problem.

So, in Case 102, after escalate at 11:30, the next step is investigate at 14:00 (2.5h delay). That might be acceptable if they can't work after hours. But 28 hours is bad. 

Another possible factor is that after escalate, the ticket might be waiting for someone to take it, leading to delays.

So the factors are:

- Delay in the Level-2 team addressing escalations, leading to delays between escalate and investigation.

- Overnight delays between investigation and resolution, which could be minimized with better staffing.

- In some cases, the time from investigation to resolve is too long, perhaps due to team workload.

Step 3: Recommendations would be to reduce the time between escalation and the Level-2 team starting work. Maybe they need better triage of escalated tickets, or more staff. Also, if possible, extending hours for Level-2 to handle urgent cases, or implementing after-hour support. Also, ensuring that when the investigation is done, the resolve step is done the same day if possible.

Also, maybe the process could have a better way to track escalated tickets to ensure they're picked up promptly.

Another idea: Maybe the Level-2 team isn't getting the tickets quickly enough after escalation. So the key issue is the Level-2's responsiveness.

Another thing: In case 105, after the first investigation by Level-1 (9:10-10:00?), then escalate, then Level-2 doesn't pick up for a day and a half. That's a big issue.

So summarizing:

Root causes 1: Delay in Level-2 team's response to escalated tickets, leading to long gaps between escalation and investigation.

Root cause 2: Overnight delays when the process halts during non-business hours, increasing total time.

Root cause 3: Prolonged delays between investigation and resolution, possibly due to team availability or inefficiency.

Proposals:

- Improve Level-2 team's responsiveness by adding staff, better prioritization, or better communication.

- Implement after-hours coverage or improve scheduling to reduce overnight delays.

- Streamline the process between investigation and resolution to reduce that step's time.

Also, maybe the escalation process itself is slow, or there's a backlog in Level-2.

Another observation: Case 105's total time is almost double that of 102 and 104, which also had escalations, but 102 and 104 took about 24-25 hours, while 105 is 49 hours. So the 28-hour delay between escalate and investigation is the key differentiator.

So the main factors are the time between escalation and the Level-2's action, and the overnight delays.

Therefore, the recommendations should address those points.

### **1. Identification of Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**

| Case ID | Total Resolution Time      |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **101** | 2 hours 15 minutes         |
| **102** | 25 hours 10 minutes        |
| **103** | 1 hour 20 minutes          |
| **104** | 24 hours 10 minutes        |
| **105** | 49 hours 5 minutes         |

Cases **102, 104, and 105** have significantly longer resolution times compared to 101 and 103. **Case 105** is the most delayed, taking nearly **49 hours**.

---

### **2. Root Causes of Performance Issues**

#### **Key Factors Causing Delays:**
1. **Delayed Escalation Handling by Level-2 Team**:
   - **Case 105**: The **28-hour delay between escalation (March 1, 10:00 AM) and Level-2 investigation (March 2, 2:00 PM)** indicates a severe backlog or lack of urgency in the Level-2 team’s response to escalated tickets.
   - **Case 102**: A 2.5-hour delay between escalation and Level-2 investigation is shorter, but still contributes to the total delay.

2. **Overnight/Non-Business-Hour Delays**:
   - All three delayed cases (102, 104, 105) have **19–23-hour gaps between investigation and resolution**, likely due to work stopping overnight. For example:
     - Case 102: Investigation ends on March 1 at 2:00 PM  Resolution starts on March 2 at 9:00 AM (19-hour gap).
     - Case 105: Investigation on March 2 at 2:00 PM  Resolution on March 3 at 9:00 AM (23-hour gap).

3. **Lengthy Post-Inveestigation Steps**:
   - In Case 105, after Level-2 starts investigating on March 2, there is an additional 23-hour delay until resolution. This suggests inefficiencies in the resolution process or insufficient resources.

---

### **3. Insights & Recommendations**

#### **Key Insights**:
- **Escalation-Related Bottlenecks**: Escalations are common but poorly handled, with delays of up to 28 hours between escalation and Level-2 action.
- **Nighttime Gaps**: Overnight gaps between investigation and resolution are unavoidable but worsen total cycle times.
- **Resource Constraints**: The Level-2 team may be under-resourced or overburdened, leading to delays.

#### **Recommendations**:
1. **Improve Escalation Handling**:
   - **Prioritize Escalateded Tickets**: Implement a system to ensure Level-2 agents acknowledge escalated tickets within hours, not days (e.g., automated alerts or dedicated escalation queues).
   - **Reduce Escalation-to-Action Time**: For Case 105, the 28-hour gap between escalation and Level-2 action is critical. Training or resource allocation for Level-2 could resolve this.

2. **Enhance After-Hour Coverage**:
   - **Night Shifts or Automated Handoffs**: Allow staff to work staggeredd shifts or use automated systems to keep processes moving overnight (e.g., pre-approved resolution templates for common issues).

3. **Streamline Post-Inveestigation Steps**:
   - **Automate Resolution Steps**: Use templates or pre-approved solutions to reduce manual processing time.
   - **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Ensure Level-1 and Level-2 teams collaborate in real-time during investigation to expedite resolution.

4. **Process Optimizations**:
   - **Reduce Redundant Steps**: In Case 105, the ticket was investigated by Level-1 before escalation. Consider faster escalation criteria to avoid wasted time.

5. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - **SLAs for Escalations**: Set strict SLAs (e.g., Level-2 must start investigation within 2 hours of escalation).
   - **Dashboards**: Track escalation-to-action times and overnight gaps to identify and address bottlenecks.

### **Summary**
Cases 102, 104, and 105 are delayed primarily due to **slow escalation handling** and **overnight gaps**. Addressing the Level-2 team’s responsiveness and improving after-hour processes will reduce cycle times dramatically.
