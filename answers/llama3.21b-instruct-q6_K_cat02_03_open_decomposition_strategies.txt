Applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects has several benefits, including:

Benefits:

1. **Improved understanding of the process**: Decomposition can help analysts and domain experts to better understand and visualize the business processes, enabling them to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement.
2. **More accurate process representations**: By breaking down complex processes into smaller components, decomposition can provide a more detailed and accurate representation of the real-world process, which is essential for developing effective process models.
3. **Enhanced data quality**: Decomposition can help extract relevant data from large amounts of process-related data, improving the overall data quality and reducing the noise in the system.
4. **Better decision support**: Process mining insights generated through decomposition can provide actionable recommendations and insights that can inform business decisions.

Challenges:

1. **Complexity of complex processes**: Decomposition often requires experts to be involved in identifying relevant process components, which can be a challenge when dealing with highly complex or specialized processes.
2. **Data quality issues**: Process mining often relies on high-quality data to generate meaningful insights; poor data quality, such as missing or inaccurate measurements, can hinder decomposition efforts.
3. **Limited expertise**: Involving experts from various domains (e.g., business process management, technology, and domain-specific knowledge) in the decomposition process can be resource-intensive and may require expertise beyond the project team's primary capabilities.
4. **Stakeholder buy-in**: Managing stakeholders' expectations and ensuring they understand the benefits of decomposing complex processes requires effective communication and stakeholder engagement.
5. **Data preparation and cleaning**: Process mining relies on high-quality, cleansed data; prepping and cleaning this data can be labor-intensive, particularly in large-scale projects with extensive databases.

To overcome these challenges, it is essential to:

* Develop a comprehensive understanding of the project's context, including stakeholders' requirements and expectations.
* Identify key process components and build teams with appropriate expertise.
* Establish effective communication channels and stakeholder management techniques.
* Continuously monitor data quality and cleanliness throughout the decomposition phase.
* Foster collaboration among domain experts, analysts, and stakeholders to ensure a shared understanding of the decomposed processes.
