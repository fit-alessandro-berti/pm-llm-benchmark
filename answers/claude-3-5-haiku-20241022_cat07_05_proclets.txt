This visualization appears to be a diagram showing a lab testing workflow with multiple components:

1. At the top, there is a process flow diagram showing two interconnected proclet classes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test"

2. The workflow includes several steps:
- Order entry
- Taking blood samples
- Receiving and judging results
- Performing tests
- Making reports
- Options for retesting if needed

3. The diagram uses various symbols and notations:
- Rectangles for activities/tasks
- Circles for decision/merge points
- Arrows showing flow direction
- Dashed lines representing channels between processes

4. At the bottom, there's a table showing an example of a performative with columns for:
- Time
- Channel
- Sender
- Receivers
- Action
- Content
- Scope
- Direction

The diagram illustrates how lab visits and lab tests are coordinated through communication channels and various workflow steps, with provision for handling both initial tests and any necessary retesting scenarios.
