### Merged Event Log

To merge the two event logs, we will align events based on the following criteria:
- **Order ID**: Events from both logs with the same `order_id` are considered for matching.
- **Timestamp Tolerance**: Events with timestamps within 2 seconds of each other are considered the same event.
- **Event Naming**: We will map similar event names from Log B to event types in Log A.

### Merged Events

1. **Order Received**
   - **Log A**: `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z, Order Received, Order#1234`
   - **Log B**: `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, OrderReceived, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"`
   - **Merged**:
     - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z` (primary from Log A)
     - `event_type`: `Order Received`
     - `event_name`: `OrderReceived`
     - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
     - `user_id`: `u45`
     - `resource_id`: `r10`
     - `notes`: `Event captured at warehouse system`

2. **Order Validated**
   - **Log A**: `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z, Order Validated, Order#1234`
   - **Log B**: `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, OrderValidation, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"`
   - **Merged**:
     - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z` (primary from Log A)
     - `event_type`: `Order Validated`
     - `event_name`: `OrderValidation`
     - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
     - `user_id`: `u12`
     - `resource_id`: `r10`
     - `notes`: `Cross-check inventory`

3. **Quality Check**
   - **Log A**: No corresponding event
   - **Log B**: `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection"`
   - **Merged**:
     - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z` (from Log B)
     - `event_type`: `Quality Check` (from Log B)
     - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
     - `user_id`: `u45`
     - `resource_id`: `r11`
     - `notes`: `Random inspection`
   - **Reasoning**: This event is only in Log B and has no corresponding event in Log A.

4. **Payment Processed**
   - **Log A**: `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234`
   - **Log B**: `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z, PaymentCheck, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"`
   - **Merged**:
     - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z` (primary from Log A)
     - `event_type`: `Payment Processed`
     - `event_name`: `PaymentCheck`
     - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
     - `user_id`: `u12`
     - `resource_id`: `r99`
     - `notes`: `Payment gateway delay`

5. **Item Shipped**
   - **Log A**: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234`
   - **Log B**: `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z, Shipping, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"`
   - **Merged**:
     - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z` (primary from Log A)
     - `event_type`: `Item Shipped`
     - `event_name`: `Shipping`
     - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
     - `user_id`: `u45`
     - `resource_id`: `r10`
     - `notes`: `Package handed to courier`

6. **Item Delivered**
   - **Log A**: `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234`
   - **Log B**: No corresponding event
   - **Merged**:
     - `timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z` (from Log A)
     - `event_type`: `Item Delivered`
     - `order_id`: `Order#1234`
   - **Reasoning**: This event is only in Log A and has no corresponding event in Log B.

| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z  | Item Delivered   |              | Order#1234 |         |             |                                 |

### Reasoning for Decisions

1. **Timestamp Tolerance**: We used a 2-second tolerance to match events based on their timestamps. This allowed us to align events that were recorded at slightly different times but likely represent the same activity.
2. **Event Naming**: We mapped `OrderReceived` to `Order Received`, `OrderValidation` to `Order Validated`, `PaymentCheck` to `Payment Processed`, and `Shipping` to `Item Shipped`.
3. **Quality Check**: This event was only present in Log B and had no corresponding event in Log A. We included it as-is, indicating its origin.
4. **Item Delivered**: This event was only present in Log A and had no corresponding event in Log B. We included it as-is, indicating its origin.

By following these criteria, we have produced a merged event log that integrates the attributes from both Log A and Log B, aligning events where possible and keeping non-matching events separate.
