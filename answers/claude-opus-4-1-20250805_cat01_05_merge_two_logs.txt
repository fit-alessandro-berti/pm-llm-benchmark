## Event Log Integration Analysis and Results

### Matching Strategy

I've analyzed both logs using the following approach:
1. **Timestamp tolerance**: ±5 seconds for matching events
2. **Event name mapping**: Identified semantic equivalents between systems
3. **Attribute preservation**: Retained all attributes from both sources when merging

### Event Matching Decisions

#### Matched Events:
1. **Order Received/OrderReceived** 
   - Log A: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z
   - Log B: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z
   - Time difference: 2 seconds
   - Decision: MERGED (same logical event, within tolerance)

2. **Order Validated/OrderValidation**
   - Log A: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z
   - Log B: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z
   - Time difference: 1 second
   - Decision: MERGED (clear semantic match, minimal time difference)

3. **Payment Processed/PaymentCheck**
   - Log A: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z
   - Log B: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z
   - Time difference: 5 seconds
   - Decision: MERGED (both relate to payment processing, Log B notes mention "gateway delay")

4. **Item Shipped/Shipping**
   - Log A: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z
   - Log B: 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z
   - Time difference: 2 seconds
   - Decision: MERGED (same logical event, within tolerance)

#### Unmatched Events:
1. **Quality Check** (Log B only)
   - Timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z
   - Decision: KEPT SEPARATE (no corresponding event in Log A)

2. **Item Delivered** (Log A only)
   - Timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z
   - Decision: KEPT SEPARATE (no corresponding event in Log B)

### Resolution Methodology

1. **Primary Timestamp Selection**: 
   - For merged events, I selected Log A's timestamp as primary when available (as it's designated the "primary" timeline)
   - Exception: Used Log B's timestamp for the first event as it appears to be the actual event occurrence time

2. **Attribute Enrichment**:
   - Combined all attributes from both logs
   - Preserved both timestamps for transparency
   - Added metadata fields (source, merge_reason) for audit trail

3. **Event Naming**:
   - Used Log A's naming convention as the standard
   - Maintained semantic clarity while preserving consistency

4. **Data Quality Observations**:
   - Log B provides richer context (user_id, resource_id, notes)
   - Log A captures the complete process (includes delivery)
   - The "Quality Check" event appears to be an intermediate step only tracked by System B
   - The slight timestamp variations suggest different capture points in the systems
