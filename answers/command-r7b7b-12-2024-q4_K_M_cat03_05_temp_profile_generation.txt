Here's a Python dictionary representing the estimated temporal profile for the given global supply chain process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (48, 12),  # Supplier selection to order placement
    ('SS', 'RC'): (72, 16),  # Supplier selection to receiving components
    ('OP', 'QI'): (36, 9),   # Order placement to quality inspection
    ('RC', 'CA'): (48, 14),  # Receiving components to assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (54, 10),  # Assembly to product testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (27, 6),   # Product testing to packaging
    ('QI', 'WS'): (39, 8.5), # Quality inspection to warehouse storage
    ('PK', 'DT'): (45, 12),  # Packaging to distribution
    ('CA', 'WS'): (42, 10.5), # Assembly to warehouse storage
    ('RC', 'DT'): (63, 14.5), # Receiving components to distribution
}
```

**Explanation:**
- I've included activity pairs that are not directly sequential but may be separated by multiple steps in the process, as per your request for complexity.
- The average times and standard deviations were estimated based on the nature of each activity and typical lead times for such processes, considering factors like supplier lead times, inspection cycles, assembly processes, testing methods, packaging logistics, and distribution networks.
- These values are approximate and can be adjusted based on real-world data and specific process variations.
