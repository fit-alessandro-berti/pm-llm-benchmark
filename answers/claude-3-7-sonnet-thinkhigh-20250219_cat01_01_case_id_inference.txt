# Case Identification Analysis of Hospital Events

After analyzing the sequence of hospital events, I can identify three distinct patient cases based on consistent patient demographic data (age and gender), logical activity sequences, and resource continuity.

## Case 1: 45-year-old Male, ER, Leg Fracture
**Events:** 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
- **Register patient** (08:05:13) - ER, private insurance
- **Initial triage** (08:10:50) - Nurse Joy, triage_code=3
- **X-ray imaging** (08:15:42) - Radiology, left_leg
- **Doctor consultation** (08:23:10) - Dr. Lee, diagnosis=hairline_fracture
- **Patient discharged** (08:30:05) - followup=outpatient_clinic

**Journey Summary:** Patient arrived at ER, was triaged, received an X-ray of the left leg which revealed a hairline fracture, consulted with Dr. Lee, and was discharged with instructions to follow up at the outpatient clinic.

## Case 2: 62-year-old Female, ER, Infection
**Events:** 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- **Register patient** (08:07:02) - ER, public insurance
- **Initial triage** (08:12:29) - Nurse Mark, triage_code=2
- **Lab test requested** (08:16:10) - Dr. Smith, test_type=blood_panel
- **Lab test completed** (08:20:27) - normal_levels
- **Doctor consultation** (08:22:54) - Dr. Smith, diagnosis=minor_infection
- **Prescription created** (08:27:00) - medication=antibiotics
- **Patient discharged** (08:35:29) - followup=pharmacy_pickup

**Journey Summary:** Patient registered at ER, was triaged with higher priority (code 2), had blood tests ordered and completed, was diagnosed with a minor infection by Dr. Smith, received an antibiotic prescription, and was discharged with instructions to pick up medications at the pharmacy.

## Case 3: 28-year-old Male, Surgery, Knee Procedure
**Events:** 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
- **Register patient** (08:07:15) - Surgery, private insurance
- **Doctor consultation** (08:13:00) - Dr. Lee, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery
- **Surgery preparation** (08:16:45) - prep_type=general_anesthesia
- **Surgery performed** (08:25:19) - procedure=arthroscopy
- **Recovery room** (08:31:37) - condition=stable
- **Patient discharged** (08:40:13) - followup=physiotherapy_sessions

**Journey Summary:** Patient arrived for scheduled knee surgery, consulted with Dr. Lee, underwent preparation for surgery with general anesthesia, had an arthroscopy procedure performed, spent time in recovery, and was discharged with physiotherapy sessions scheduled.

## Analysis Methods Used
To identify these cases, I examined:
1. **Patient demographics** (age and gender) as primary identifiers
2. **Timestamp progression** for logical sequence of activities
3. **Department consistency** throughout each journey
4. **Resource continuity** (e.g., same doctor handling consultation and treatment)
5. **Clinical logic** in the progression of activities (e.g., test  diagnosis  treatment  discharge)

The events from these three distinct cases were interleaved in the log but can be clearly separated into coherent patient journeys based on the above factors.
