A good “middleground” model that abstracts away the fine details of exactly how many missinginfo requests occur (and might even “overgenerate” a bit but still captures the main behavior) is as follows. In words, every case:
• starts by receiving the application (RA),
• then validates the form (VF),
• then assesses eligibility (AE),
• then optionally (zero or more times) goes into a “missing information” loop where the system requests missing info (RMI) and then revalidates the form (VF),
• then makes the approval decision (AD),
• sends the confirmation (SC) and finally
• archives the case (AC).

One acceptable final process tree (using the operators introduced) is to have a toplevel sequence (“”) that executes the basic steps in order and, where the options occur, a loop (operator “*”) is used to “wrap” the missinginfo repetition. In our notation the final tree is:

 ( 
"Receive Application (RA)",
"Validate Form (VF)",
"Assess Eligibility (AE)",
* ( tau,  ( "Request Missing Info (RMI)", "Validate Form (VF)" ) ),
"Approval Decision (AD)",
"Send Confirmation (SC)",
"Archive Case (AC)"
)

A few comments:
1. The loop operator “* (A, B)” works as follows. First A is executed (here we use a silent “tau” activity to mark the choice point) and then either the process terminates the loop or B is executed and then A is executed again (thus allowing arbitrarily many iterations). In our model the visible part of each loopiteration is the subsequence  ( RMI, VF ).
2. In cases where no missinginfo iteration is needed (as in Case 2 of the event log), the loop is “skipped” (that is, the silent A is executed and then the loop terminates). If a request is needed (as in Cases 1 and 3) the loop is taken once or multiple times. (Note that in Case 3 the model “abstracts” two consecutive RMI events into two iterations, each carrying the pair RMI–VF; while the log shows two RMIs before a single VF, many discovery techniques sacrifice exact repetition counts for a simpler model that nonetheless captures the possibility of “reasking” for information.)
3. This model balances fitness (by allowing the repetitive behavior), precision (by not “overcomplicating” the ordering of the remaining activities) and simplicity.

When constructing this in code using pm4py’s ProcessTree class, one would create the root node with a SEQUENCE operator and add children corresponding to the activities and the loop subtree. (Remember that when adding a subtree as a child you must also set its parent pointer appropriately.)

This final process tree concisely represents the “main flow” and the optional repeating missinginfo revalidation sequence observed in the log.
