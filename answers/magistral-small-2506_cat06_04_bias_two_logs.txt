### **Analysis of Bias in Event Logs**

The two event logs represent applications from **Group A (Protected Group)** and **Group B (Unprotected Group)**. Comparing them reveals systematic differences in decision-making, particularly due to the **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup** attributes and the **ScoreAdjustment** column.

---

### **1. Bias in Group B (Unprotected Group)**
Group B exhibits **favorable bias** due to two key factors:

#### **(a) LocalResident Status**
- In **Group B**, all applicants are **LocalResidents (TRUE)**, whereas in **Group A**, none are.
- Local residents receive a **+10 (Community Boost)** adjustment in their scores, which increases their PreliminaryScore by 10 points.
  - Example: **U001** (LocalResident) has a **PreliminaryScore of 720**, which is adjusted to **730** due to the boost.
  - **U003** (LocalResident) has a **PreliminaryScore of 695**, adjusted to **705**.

#### **(b) CommunityGroup Affiliation**
- **Group B** applicants are associated with **CommunityGroups (e.g., Highland Civic Darts Club)**, while **Group A** applicants have **None**.
- The presence of a **CommunityGroup** appears to further influence scoring, as seen in **ManualReview** and **FinalDecision** stages, where the ScoreAdjustment is explicitly noted.
  - **U001** and **U003** benefit from **Community Boost**, increasing their chances of approval.

#### **Outcome of Bias in Group B**
- **Higher Approval Rate**:
  - **U001 (730  Approved)** and **U003 (705  Approved)** are approved despite **U003** originally having a lower score (695).
  - **U002 (710  Rejected)** is the only rejection, but it had no Community Boost.
- **Disproportionate Advantage**: Local residents and community members get an extra boost, increasing their approval odds compared to non-local, unaffiliated applicants.

---

### **2. No Bias in Group A (Protected Group)**
- **Group A** applicants have:
  - **No LocalResident status (FALSE)**  No **Community Boost**.
  - **No CommunityGroup (None)**  No additional score adjustments.
- Their scores remain **unchanged** throughout the process:
  - **P001 (720  Approved)** and **P003 (740  Approved)** are approved based on raw scores.
  - **P002 (710  Rejected)** is rejected without any adjustments.
- Decisions are made purely on **PreliminaryScore** without external factors.

---

### **Conclusion: Favorable Bias in Group B**
- **Systematic Advantage for Local Residents & Community Members**:
  - The **+10 (Community Boost)** in **Group B** artificially inflates scores, increasing approval rates for local residents.
  - **Group A** applicants (non-local, unaffiliated) are evaluated strictly by their raw scores.
- **Potential Fairness Issues**:
  - The bias in **Group B** could mean that **lower-scoring local residents (e.g., U003: 695)** get approved, while **higher-scoring non-local applicants (e.g., P002: 710)** are rejected.
  - This creates a **disparity in outcomes** based on non-merit factors (geographical affiliation rather than actual qualifications).

### **Final Verdict**
- **Group B exhibits bias** due to the **LocalResident and CommunityGroup adjustments**, which systematically favor certain applicants regardless of their raw scores.
- **Group A shows no such bias**, as decisions are based purely on merit (PreliminaryScore).

This suggests that **Group B’s scoring mechanism may need review** to ensure fairness across all applicants.
