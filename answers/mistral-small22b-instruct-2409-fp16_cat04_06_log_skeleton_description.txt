 The data provided describes a workflow or approval process for declarations within an organization. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Employee Submission**: An employee submits a declaration. This action is represented by transitions like 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'.

2. **Initial Approval**: The submitted declaration then goes through various approval stages:
    - **Pre-approver Review**: It is first reviewed by a pre-approver ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'). If approved, it moves forward; otherwise, it gets rejected and may go back to the employee or another stage depending on specific rules.
    - **Budget Owner Approval**: After initial approval, the declaration is reviewed by a budget owner ('Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER', 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER').

3. **Administration Review**: Following the budget owner's decision, the declaration is sent to an administration for further review:
    - If approved by the administration ('Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION'), it proceeds; otherwise, it is rejected and may go back or be handled differently based on the context.

4. **Supervisor Final Approval**: Finally, a supervisor reviews the declaration:
    - If all previous approvals are successful, the supervisor gives final approval ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR').
    - In case of any rejections in earlier stages, the supervisor may review and decide on next steps.

5. **Payment Request**: Once all necessary approvals are obtained and the declaration is finalized ('FINAL APPROVAL'), a payment request can be made ('Request Payment') and subsequently handled ('Payment Handled').

6. **Rejection Handling**: If at any stage of approval (pre-approver, budget owner, administration) the declaration is rejected:
    - The process may restart with the employee submitting a new declaration or making corrections based on feedback.
    - Specific rejections such as 'MISSING' indicate issues that need addressing before resubmission.

7. **Directly-Follows Constraints**: These constraints enforce specific sequences in the workflow:
   - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' must follow 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'.
   - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' must follow 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'.
   - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' must follow 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.

### Key Stages and Activities:
- **Submission**: Declaration is submitted.
- **Pre-approval**: First level of review by a pre-approver.
- **Budget owner approval**: Review by the budget owner.
- **Administration review**: Further check by administration.
- **Supervisor final approval**: Final sign-off by supervisor.
- **Payment request and handling**: Initiating payment after all approvals.

### Common Transitions:
- Multiple transitions from one stage to the next, e.g., 'Declaration APPROVED by X' leading to 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by Y'.
- Rejections lead back to earlier stages or require re-submission by the employee.

Overall, this data describes a multi-level approval process for declarations within an organization, ensuring thorough checks and approvals before any payment is made.
