**Assumptions and Notes:**

* **Missing Data:** The tables don't include timestamps for order creation in some cases. I've used timestamps from the `order_date` column for these instances. 
* **Multiple Shipments:** The delivery table shows multiple shipments for some orders (e.g., order 1002). I've included each dispatch and arrival event separately.
* **Event Ordering:**  The event log ensures chronological order based on timestamps. 
* **Other Attributes:** I've included order priority, carrier, delivery note, invoice amount, payment reference, and payment method as additional attributes for clarity.
