Here are the main differences in the treatment processes between the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups based on the provided process variants and performance metrics:

### 1. **Initial Registration and Examination:**
- **Protected Group:** 
  - A significant number of patients register at either ER or FD, with many undergoing a standard or expert examination directly after registration.
  - Variants like "Register at ER -> Examination" or "Register at FD -> Expert Examination" are common.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - There's a higher frequency of patients going through more thorough initial assessments like "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination" or similar paths involving detailed examinations early on.

### 2. **Thoroughness of Examination:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Less frequent use of thorough examinations in the initial stages. For example, paths involving "Thorough Examination" are less common compared to direct examination routes.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - A much higher emphasis on thorough examinations, especially early in the process. For instance, "Register at ER/FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination" is more frequent, suggesting a more intensive initial diagnostic approach.

### 3. **Treatment Pathways:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - More straightforward paths like "Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment" are common, with fewer steps involved in the treatment process before discharge.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - More complex pathways involving multiple diagnoses and treatments, such as "Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge," indicating possibly more severe or complex cases requiring multiple interventions.

### 4. **Frequency of Unsuccessful Treatments:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Fewer instances where treatment is unsuccessful, leading to a second round of diagnosis and treatment. This might suggest either simpler cases or potentially less aggressive initial treatment strategies.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Higher instances of treatment failure leading to repeated cycles of diagnosis and treatment. This could imply either more challenging medical conditions or perhaps a more rigorous approach to ensure thorough treatment before discharge.

### 5. **Performance Time:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The performance times (time taken for the process) are generally lower for similar pathways compared to the unprotected group. For instance, the process ending in "Treatment successful -> Discharge" shows lower performance times in the protected group.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Higher performance times for similar pathways, suggesting longer durations for treatment processes. This could be due to more complex cases or perhaps more comprehensive care processes.

### 6. **Discharge Without Full Process:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - More instances of patients registering and then stopping the process (e.g., "Register at ER" with no performance time), which might indicate drop-offs or incomplete treatments.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - There's a notable variant where patients are discharged without going through the full treatment process ("Discharge" as a standalone variant), which might suggest administrative discharges or perhaps a higher rate of non-compliance or incomplete treatments.

### Conclusion:
The differences suggest that the unprotected group might be receiving more intensive and thorough medical attention, potentially indicating either more severe health issues or a policy of more cautious and comprehensive care. The protected group, on the other hand, seems to have more straightforward and possibly less time-consuming treatment paths, which might reflect either simpler health issues or different treatment protocols. These disparities could point to systemic differences in how healthcare is administered to these groups, potentially highlighting areas for further investigation regarding equity in healthcare delivery.
