Here's a breakdown of the activities and the rationale behind each labeling:

**Activity Labels and Explanation:**

1.  **Idle Time/Preparation:**
    *   **Events:** Events 1-3, events 13-15
    *   **Explanation:** These events show the machine in a state of rest or initial startup, which might indicate the beginning of an activity or setup phase. Temperature, vibration, and material flow are low, suggesting the machine is idle or the process is not yet active.

2.  **Cutting/Milling:**
    *   **Events:** Events 4-6
    *   **Explanation:** The temperature rises, and the vibration level increases significantly. The tool position is also changing (moving). This would be consistent with a cutting or milling operation. The increase in energy consumption is also very indicative of an operation.

3.  **Possible Assembling:**
    *   **Events:** Events 7-8
    *   **Explanation:** The temperature begins to decrease, and the vibration level is lower than cutting. The material flow rate is at a steady, though lower, level than the cutting operation. The tool position also remains constant. The overall change could indicate an assembling process.

4.  **Welding/High-Intensity Operation:**
    *   **Events:** Event 9
    *   **Explanation:** The temperature is at its highest point, vibration is at its highest point. This indicates that the machine is likely undergoing a welding process due to the heat generated, and potential for strong vibration.

5.  **Post-Processing/Inspection:**
    *   **Events:** Events 10-12
    *   **Explanation:** The vibration, temperature, and energy usage all decrease. The machine appears to have completed some form of cutting operation. The material flow rate remains low. The tool position is constant. This indicates that the activity might be related to quality inspection or secondary operation, like deburring.
