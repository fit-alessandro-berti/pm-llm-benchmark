Here’s a concise analysis of case duration, likely drivers, and targeted mitigations.

1) Cases with significantly longer total lead time (Submit Claim to Close Claim)
- Case 2001 (A, Low): 1h30m
- Case 2004 (B, Low): 1h25m
- Case 2002 (B, Medium): ~1d1h55m
- Case 2003 (A, High): ~2d0h20m
- Case 2005 (B, High): ~3d5h05m

Outliers/slow cases: 2002, 2003, 2005. Case 2005 is the slowest by far.

2) Attribute-driven patterns and root causes
a) Complexity
- Low complexity (2001, 2004): complete within ~1.5 hours with straight-through path (no additional docs).
- Medium (2002): one “Request Additional Documents” event and next-day approval, causing a ~1 day jump.
- High (2003, 2005): multiple “Request Additional Documents” loops and longer waits to approval/payment. 2005 has three such requests, stretching cycle time to >3 days.
Root cause: High complexity drives repeated information gaps and back-and-forth, elongating waiting time between document requests and approval.

b) Region
- Region A: Low (2001) is fast; High (2003) is long but shorter than B High. Suggests complexity is main driver; however, Region A high-complexity case (2003) still finished faster than Region B high-complexity (2005).
- Region B: Medium (2002) already takes >1 day; High (2005) is slowest overall. Region B shows longer waits between “Request Additional Documents” and “Approve,” and between “Approve” and “Pay.”
Root cause: Region B likely has longer handoffs/queues (e.g., adjuster workload, cross-team SLAs).

c) Resource
- Adjusters:
  • Adjuster_Mike (A, 2003 High): 2 requests for additional documents, total ~2 days.
  • Adjuster_Lisa (B, 2002 Medium & 2005 High): 1 request (medium) and 3 requests (high), with notably longer elapsed time in 2005.
- Managers:
  • Manager_Ann (A/B, low/medium): approvals same day or next morning.
  • Manager_Bill (A/B, high): approvals occur much later (next day or more). 2003 and 2005 approvals by Bill occur late in the timeline.
- Finance:
  • Finance_Alan (A) seems to pay quickly after approval.
  • Finance_Carl (B) has short lags post-approval in these samples, but overall Region B still lags more due to upstream delay.
Root causes:
- Adjuster_Lisa’s high-complex cases in Region B have more rework (multiple document requests), indicating either stricter checks, incomplete initial scoping, or claimant responsiveness issues.
- Manager_Bill appears in both high-complex cases; approvals occur later in the cycle, potentially due to availability, batching, or higher review threshold.
- Region A finance (Alan) pays promptly; Region B finance (Carl) is OK in these data, so the main delay in B is before approval.

3) Explanations and actionable mitigations
Why these attributes contribute:
- High complexity increases uncertainty and documentation needs, leading to multiple “Request Additional Documents” loops and longer waiting for customers to respond.
- Region B may have higher workload, different SLAs, or coordination inefficiencies between adjusters and management, extending queue times.
- Specific resources:
  • Adjuster_Lisa: More document cycles on high complexity, suggesting gaps in initial information capture, or more conservative review standards.
  • Manager_Bill: Later approvals on high complexity may reflect limited availability, batching behavior, or stricter approval policies.

Mitigations
1) Reduce document-request loops for high complexity:
   - Introduce a structured initial triage checklist tailored for high complexity to capture all likely documents up front.
   - Use a “pre-approval huddle” between adjuster and manager for high complexity to confirm completeness before first request.
   - Provide claimants with guided digital upload and validation (dynamic forms, required fields, reminders) to speed response.

2) Balance workload and SLAs in Region B:
   - Monitor adjuster and manager work-in-progress; reassign high-complex cases during peaks.
   - Set explicit SLA targets for time from “Evaluate” to first “Request Additional Documents,” and from “All docs received” to “Approve,” with alerts for breaches.
   - Consider centralizing or cross-regional pooling for high-complex approvals to avoid bottlenecks in Region B.

3) Resource-specific improvements:
   - Coaching and playbooks for Adjuster_Lisa on high-complex triage to reduce repeated requests; peer review of first-pass documentation list.
   - For Manager_Bill, introduce timeboxed approval windows or backup approvers for high complexity; implement prioritization rules for cases waiting on approval.
   - Track per-resource cycle time metrics (evaluate-to-request, last-doc-to-approve, approve-to-pay) and use them in continuous improvement.

4) Process design tweaks:
   - Gate: do not move to approval queue until a “documentation completeness” checklist is satisfied.
   - Automated reminders/escalations to claimants after a document request, with aging visibility to adjusters.
   - Bundle document requests (one consolidated ask) instead of multiple sequential requests when feasible.

Summary
- Slow cases: 2002 (Medium, B), 2003 (High, A), 2005 (High, B; slowest).
- Main driver: Complexity, amplified by Region B and specific resource patterns (Adjuster_Lisa’s multiple doc requests; Manager_Bill’s later approvals).
- Focus mitigations on improved high-complex triage, Region B workload/SLA management, and targeted coaching/backup for involved resources to cut loops and waiting time.
