### **Identified Temporal Anomalies in the Insurance Claim Process**

1. **Receive (R) to Approve (P):**  
   - **Observed:** Average time is ~25 hours with **low standard deviation** (1 hour).  
   - **Anomaly:** Extremely consistent approval timing suggests automation or rigid scheduling that doesn’t reflect real-world variety.

2. **Approve (P) to Notify (N):**  
   - **Observed:** Average time is 7 days with **very high variation** (±2 days).  
   - **Anomaly:** Unpredictable communication lag. Notification sometimes occurs very late, or almost immediately.

3. **Assign (A) to Close (C):**  
   - **Observed:** Only 2 hours on average between assignment and closing.  
   - **Anomaly:** May indicate **skipping evaluation/approval steps**, or auto-closure logic for certain claim types.

4. **Evaluate (E) to Notify (N):**  
   - **Observed:** Average time is 5 minutes.  
   - **Anomaly:** Implies **immediate notification after evaluation**, potentially skipping approval or not waiting for manual review.

### **Generated Hypotheses Explaining Anomalies**

1. **(R  P) Low Standard Deviation Hypothesis:**  
   - Approval might be **automated or scheduled via batch jobs** that trigger at specific intervals (e.g., once per day).  
   - Manual interventions might be rare, explaining tight timing consistency.

2. **(P  N) High Variability Hypothesis:**  
   - Notification delays may be linked to **backlogged support staff**, asynchronous communication channels (email vs. phone), or **region-specific policies**.  
   - Inconsistent SLA adherence or lack of automated follow-ups might also play a role.

3. **(A  C) Short Duration Hypothesis:**  
   - Claims closed shortly after assignment may represent **auto-approvals**, **fraud rejections**, or **duplicate claims** being closed as invalid.  
   - Alternatively, certain claim types (e.g., minor auto repairs) may follow a fast-track route.

4. **(E  N) Immediate Notification Hypothesis:**  
   - Either approval is occurring **before evaluation** (process reordering), or approval is being **implicitly assumed** immediately after evaluation without system tracking.  
   - Alternatively, the process may **bundle approve-notify-evaluate** into one action in some automated workflows.

### **Proposed SQL Queries for Verification**

---

#### **Query 1: Claims where R  P standard deviation is unusually low (< 2 hours)**
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS seconds_R_to_P
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'R'
  AND ce2.activity = 'P'
  AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
ORDER BY seconds_R_to_P;
```
- **Purpose:** Detect claims with rigid/identical durations between receive and approval across many claims.

---

#### **Query 2: Claims where P  N exceeds 5 days (anomalies in notification delay)**
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp))/86400 AS days_P_to_N,
       c.claim_type,
       a.region
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN claim_events ca ON ca.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ca.activity = 'A'
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ca.resource = a.name
WHERE ce1.activity = 'P'
  AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
  AND (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days';
```
- **Purpose:** Identify if delays in notifying customers correlate with certain regions or claim types.

---

#### **Query 3: Claims where Assign (A) and Close (C) happen within 2 hours**
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_A_to_C,
       c.claim_type,
       a.region
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.name
WHERE ce1.activity = 'A'
  AND ce2.activity = 'C'
  AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
  AND (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) <= INTERVAL '2 hours';
```
- **Purpose:** Assess whether early closures post-assignment are linked to fast-track policies, auto-validation, or specific adjuster behaviors.

---

#### **Query 4: Claims with Notify (N) immediately after Evaluate (E) (<10 minutes gap)**
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 60 AS minutes_E_to_N,
       c.claim_type,
       a.region
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN claim_events ca ON ca.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ca.activity = 'A'
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ca.resource = a.name
WHERE ce1.activity = 'E'
  AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
  AND (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) <= INTERVAL '10 minutes';
```
- **Purpose:** Trace whether evaluatenotify occurs too quickly, and if so, whether certain adjusters or claim types are involved.

---

#### **Query 5: Claims with missing intermediate steps (e.g., No E or P between A and C)**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events a ON c.claim_id = a.claim_id AND a.activity = 'A'
JOIN claim_events cl ON c.claim_id = cl.claim_id AND cl.activity = 'C'
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e
    WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e.activity IN ('E', 'P')
      AND e.timestamp BETWEEN a.timestamp AND cl.timestamp
);
```
- **Purpose:** Find claims where crucial workflow states (Evaluate or Approve) were bypassed between assignment and closure.

---

#### **Query 6: Correlation of anomalies with specific adjusters**
```sql
SELECT a.adjuster_id, a.name, COUNT(DISTINCT ce.claim_id) AS affected_claims
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE ce.activity = 'P'
  AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  AND ce2.timestamp > ce.timestamp
  AND (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name
ORDER BY affected_claims DESC;
```
- **Purpose:** Evaluate whether specific adjusters are associated with longer-than-average turnaround times for notifying customers after approval.

### **Summary**
This analysis combines process mining insights with SQL-based data exploration to reveal how timing anomalies in an insurance claim process could stem from automation patterns, missing process steps, or human bottlenecks. The proposed SQL queries allow deeper inspection across process variants, resources, and data inconsistencies to validate or refute these hypotheses.
