### **1. Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times**

To identify cases with significantly longer resolution times, we first calculate the total resolution time for each case by subtracting the 'Receive Ticket' timestamp from the 'Close Ticket' timestamp.

| Case ID | Receive Timestamp       | Close Timestamp         | Total Resolution Time |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00        | 2024-03-01 10:15        | **2 hours 15 minutes** |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05        | 2024-03-02 09:15        | **25 hours 10 minutes**|
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10        | 2024-03-01 09:30        | **1 hour 20 minutes**  |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20        | 2024-03-02 08:30        | **24 hours 10 minutes**|
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25        | 2024-03-03 09:30        | **48 hours 5 minutes** |


**Cases with significantly longer resolution times:**
- **Case 102**: 25 hours 10 minutes
- **Case 104**: 24 hours 10 minutes
- **Case 105**: 48 hours 5 minutes (most significant delay)

### **2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues**

#### For Case 102:
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent**: The escalation occurred at 11:30 on the same day it was received, but the investigation by the Level-2 Agent didn't begin until 14:00 the next day, indicating a **potential 26-hour delay** in Level-2 Agent's response or assignment.
- **Long Waiting Time for Resolution Post-Investigation**: After the investigation started on the second day, the ticket was resolved relatively quickly, suggesting that the delay was primarily before the Level-2 Agent's investigation.

#### For Case 104:
- **No Escalation, but Significant Delay**: The delay here isn't due to escalation but rather a **long gap between investigating the issue (13:00 on Day 1) and resolving the ticket (08:00 on Day 2)**, suggesting **either a complexity in the issue requiring overnight review or a lack of immediate resource availability**.

#### For Case 105:
- **Escalation and Successive Delays**: 
  - **Initial Escalation Delay**: Escalated at 10:00 on Day 1, but the second investigation phase didn't start until 14:00 on Day 2, another **significant delay post-escalation**.
  - **Further Delay Before Resolution**: After the second investigation phase on Day 2, there was another **full day wait** before the ticket was resolved on Day 3.

### **3. Insights and Recommendations**

**Insights:**
- **Escalations** are associated with longer resolution times, primarily due to delays in response or assignment at the higher level.
- **Resource Availability**: Delays between investigation and resolution suggest potential bottlenecks in resource allocation or the complexity of issues.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Enhance Escalation Process**:
   - **Streamline Level-2 Agent Assignment**: Reduce response times by automating escalation assignments or ensuring Level-2 Agents are always on standby for critical issues.
   - **Set Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for Escalations**: Define and communicate clear response and resolution timelines for escalated tickets.

2. **Optimize Resource Allocation**:
   - **Real-time Resource Monitoring**: Utilize tools to monitor agent workloads, enabling more efficient task allocation and minimizing delays.
   - **Enhanced Training for Level-1 Agents**: Equip Level-1 Agents with skills to handle a wider range of issues, potentially reducing the need for escalations.

3. **Process Review for Unnecessary Delays**:
   - **Regular Audit of Ticket Lifecycles**: Identify recurring bottlenecks or patterns of delay to address systemic issues.
   - **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback loop from both customers and agents to pinpoint and rectify root causes of delays.
