Based on the details provided in each event—such as patient age, gender, department, and the logical flow of activities—we can identify **three distinct patient journeys (cases)**. One effective way to group the events is to follow the registration details and then trace the subsequent events that match the patient’s demographics and care pathway. Here’s how the events break down:

---

### **Case 1: Patient (45, M) – Mainly an ER Journey with Radiology Involvement**

### **Final Grouping Summary**

- **Case 1 (45, M):** Events **1, 4, 7, 12, 15**  
- **Case 2 (62, F):** Events **2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17**  
- **Case 3 (28, M):** Events **3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18**

This grouping is inferred from the consistent demographic data (age and gender), the logical progression of events (registration → triage/consultation → treatment → discharge), and the departmental context (ER vs. Surgery).
