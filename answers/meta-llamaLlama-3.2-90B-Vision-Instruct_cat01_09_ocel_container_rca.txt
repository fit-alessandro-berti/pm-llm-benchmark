Based on the provided directly follows graph, several potential root causes for performance issues in the process can be identified:

1. **Long duration between "Place in Stock" and "Bring to Loading Bay" for Containers**: The duration of 743380.51 minutes (approximately 493 days) between these two activities suggests a significant delay, which could be causing performance issues. This delay might be due to inefficient storage or retrieval processes, or inadequate capacity planning.

2. **Long duration between "Order Empty Containers" and "Pick Up Empty Container" for Containers**: The duration of 368943.92 minutes (approximately 245 days) between these two activities indicates a substantial delay. This could be caused by issues with container availability, transportation, or supplier performance.

3. **High frequency and long duration of "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" for Trucks and Containers**: The high frequency (8559 events) and long duration (5259.71 minutes, approximately 88 hours) of this self-looping activity suggest inefficiencies in the loading process. This could be due to inadequate truck capacity, inefficient loading procedures, or poor scheduling.

4. **Long duration between "Book Vehicles" and "Load to Vehicle" for Vehicles**: The duration of 283101.01 minutes (approximately 188 days) between these two activities indicates a significant delay, which could be caused by issues with vehicle availability, scheduling, or communication with transportation providers.

5. **Frequent rescheduling of containers**: The high frequency of "Reschedule Container" activities for Containers, Vehicles, and Transport Documents suggests that the initial scheduling is often not accurate, leading to rework and potential delays. This could be caused by inadequate capacity planning, poor forecasting, or inefficient scheduling algorithms.

6. **Long duration between "Depart" and "Depart" for Transport Documents**: The duration of 1051301.41 minutes (approximately 702 days) between these two self-looping activities indicates a significant delay, which could be caused by issues with transportation, customs clearance, or documentation.

7. **Inefficient use of Forklifts**: The high frequency of "Bring to Loading Bay" and "Load to Vehicle" activities for Forklifts, with relatively short durations, suggests that these resources are being utilized inefficiently. This could be caused by poor scheduling, inadequate training, or inefficient warehouse layouts.

By addressing these specific process and data-related issues, the performance of the overall process can be improved.
