 The patient journey through the healthcare system as outlined in the frequencies and performances can vary significantly based on multiple factors such as the nature of the illness, the accuracy of diagnosis, the efficacy of treatment, and the complexity of the case. Here are some main differences and insights based on the provided data:

1. **Frequencies of Steps**: Some steps like "Register at ER" or "Register at FD" are common initial points, while others like "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis" are intermediate steps that may indicate complications or initial misdiagnoses. The frequency of each step gives us an idea of how often these occur in the patient journey.

2. **Performance Metrics**: This seems to be a measure of efficiency or cost, as indicated by the units (e.g., "480007.142"). Higher numbers suggest longer or more expensive processes, which could be due to various reasons such as:
   - Complexity of the patient's condition.
   - Multiple comorbidities or co-infections.
   - The need for specialized tests and treatments.
   - The need for extended hospital stays or multiple follow-up visits.

3. **Treatment Success Rate**: The journey with the highest success rate is "Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a performance of 220004.479. This indicates a relatively smooth and effective patient care process, likely due to accurate diagnostics leading to successful treatment.

4. **Treatment Unsuccessful Followed by Success**: Some journeys include "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis" before the final "Treatment successful -> Discharge." This suggests that healthcare providers are willing to revise diagnoses and treatments based on patient responses, leading to better outcomes.

5. **ER vs. FD Registration**: There are differences in the frequency of starting at the Emergency Room (ER) versus the Family Doctor (FD). Higher frequencies at the ER may indicate that certain conditions are perceived as emergencies or that patients do not have a primary care provider.

6. **Complex Cases with Multiple Unsuccessful Treatments**: Some journeys involve multiple "Treatment unsuccessful" steps before reaching a successful treatment, followed by discharge. These cases are more complex and may involve rare conditions, drug resistances, or difficult-to-treat diseases. The journey with the lowest performance (639982.275) reflects a particularly complicated case that required multiple rounds of diagnosis and treatment before reaching a successful outcome.

7. **Direct Diagnosis to Discharge**: There are fewer cases where "Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" is direct without any "unsuccessful" treatment steps in between. This suggests that for some patients, the initial diagnosis and treatment plan work on the first try.

8. **Outlier Cases**: The journey with the highest performance (640012.077) for a successful outcome after multiple unsuccessful treatments is an outlier. It reflects a particularly long and expensive patient care process, possibly due to a very serious or rare condition that required extensive testing and treatment before being resolved.

In summary, the differences in these patient journeys highlight the variability in healthcare experiences based on individual patient needs, the complexity of their conditions, and the effectiveness of the healthcare provided. The data also underscores the importance of resilience in healthcare systems, where providers must be prepared to revise diagnoses and treatments multiple times to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.
