To group the events into separate cases, we need to leverage the unique attributes of each event while considering the logical sequence of hospital processes that typically occur. Here is a systematic approach to identifying the different cases:

### Identifying Unique Cases

#### Case 1: Patient with age 45, male
- **Register patient** (Event 1)
- **Initial triage** (Event 4)
- **X-ray imaging** (Event 7)
- **Doctor consultation** (Event 13)
- **Patient discharged** (Event 15)

#### Case 2: Patient with age 62, female
- **Register patient** (Event 2)
- **Initial triage** (Event 5)
- **Lab test requested** (Event 8)
- **Lab test completed** (Event 10)
- **Doctor consultation** (Event 12)
- **Prescription created** (Event 14)
- **Patient discharged** (Event 17)

#### Case 3: Patient with age 28, male
- **Register patient** (Event 3)
- **Doctor consultation** (Event 6)
- **Surgery preparation** (Event 9)
- **Surgery performed** (Event 13)
- **Recovery room** (Event 16)
- **Patient discharged** (Event 18)

### Grouped Events

#### Case 1:
1. Event 1: Register patient (45-year-old male registered)
2. Event 4: Initial triage (Same patient from department ER)
3. Event 7: X-ray imaging (Same patient, continuing in ER)
4. Event 13: Doctor consultation (45-year-old male diagnosed in ER)
5. Event 15: Patient discharged from ER

#### Case 2:
1. Event 2: Register patient (62-year-old female registered)
2. Event 5: Initial triage (Same patient from department ER, follows registration step)
3. Event 8: Lab test requested (Same patient, activity appropriate post-triage in ER)
4. Event 10: Lab test completed (Same patient, result of lab test requested)
5. Event 12: Doctor consultation (Same patient, further diagnosis made for female)
6. Event 14: Prescription created (Female patient receiving medication, aligns with the infection diagnosis)
7. Event 17: Patient discharged (62-year-old female discharged after treatment)

#### Case 3:
1. Event 3: Register patient (28-year-old male registered)
2. Event 6: Doctor consultation (Same patient, continues in surgery department)
3. Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery follows consultation, specific to 28-year-old male)
4. Event 13: Surgery performed (Same patient identified via surgery activity)
5. Event 16: Recovery room (Male patient age 28 moving to recovery post-surgery)
6. Event 18: Patient discharged (Patient ready to leave Surgery, indicating end of process)

### Verification

Each identified case corresponds to a single patient journey based on age, gender, department, activity flow, and timestamp sequence. Events for each patient follow a logical path consistent with hospital processes. The events involving the same patient's age and gender are grouped together, aligned with their treatment plan and discharge records.
