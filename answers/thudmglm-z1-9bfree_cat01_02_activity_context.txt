**Justification for Renaming:**

1. **Verify Documents  Evolved into context-specific names**:
   - **Initial Identity Verification**: First occurrence in all cases (e.g., C001/C002/C003) where agents validate identity *before* intermediate steps.
   - **Re-Verification with Documentation**: Post-customer action (e.g., C001’s second verification after upload).
   - **Post-Adjustment Validation**: Follow-up after account corrections (e.g., C003’s final doc check).

2. **Call Customer  Differentiated by purpose**:
   - **Request Missing Documentation**: To trigger customer action (C001).
   - **Clarify Account Discrepancy**: For issue resolution (C002).
   - **Return Visit Scheduling**: To recover absent customers (C003).

3. **Adjust Account  Reflected cause of adjustment**:
   - **Account Discrepancy Correction**: Post-call dispute resolution (C002).
   - **Missing Data Internal Fix**: Systematic error correction (C003).

**Key Context Clues**:
- Timestamps and resource changes (e.g., `BranchOfficer` vs. `BackOfficeAgent`) indicate roles shifting during re-verifications.
- `Additional Context` notes (e.g., “Customer stepped out”) directly inform names like **Return Visit Scheduling**.
- Repetition of steps post-customer action (e.g., C001’s re-verification) necessitates unique names.

This disambiguates activities and maps them to *specific process stages* (initial vs. iterative), *customer actions* (uploading vs. declining), and *error resolution contexts* (discrepancy vs. data gaps).
