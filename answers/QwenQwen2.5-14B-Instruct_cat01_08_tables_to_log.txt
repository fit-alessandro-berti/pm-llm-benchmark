To create a comprehensive event log for process mining, we will combine the data from the given tables and structure it according to the defined requirements. Here's the resulting event log in a structured table format:

| Case ID   | Activity Name           | Timestamp                  | Resource/Actor      | Other Attributes             |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|

The event log follows the specified format with each event corresponding to a unique case (order_id). The timestamps are aligned with the real process flow, and the "Resource/Actor" column includes the responsible party for each event. Additional attributes such as item details and billing amounts are included when relevant.

This event log is now ready for further analysis using process mining techniques to identify bottlenecks, improve process efficiency, and optimize the order-to-cash cycle.
