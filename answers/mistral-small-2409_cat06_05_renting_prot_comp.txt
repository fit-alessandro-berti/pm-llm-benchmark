To identify the main differences in the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups based on the provided process variants and their execution times, we can compare the processes and performance metrics. Here are the key differences:

### Frequency of Process Variants
1. **Rejection Processes**:
   - **Protected Group**: Frequencies of rejection processes (e.g., `Reject Prospective Tenant`) are significantly lower compared to the unprotected group.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Frequencies of rejection processes are much higher, indicating that members of this group are more likely to be rejected.

2. **Extensive Screening**:
   - **Protected Group**: There is a higher incidence of extensive screening processes (`Extensive Screening`) before rejection or acceptance, suggesting a more thorough evaluation process.
   - **Unprotected Group**: While extensive screening does occur, it is not as frequent or extensive as in the protected group.

### Performance Metrics
1. **Execution Time**:
   - **Protected Group**: The execution times for various process variants, especially those involving extensive screening, are significantly higher compared to the unprotected group. This could indicate a more rigorous evaluation process.
   - **Unprotected Group**: The execution times are generally lower, suggesting a quicker decision-making process.

### Process Outcomes
1. **Tenant Cancellation**:
   - **Protected Group**: There are several process variants that end with `Tenant Cancels Apartment` after multiple rent payments, suggesting a more favorable outcome for the protected group.
   - **Unprotected Group**: The process variants ending with `Tenant Cancels Apartment` typically occur after fewer rent payments, indicating a less favorable outcome.

2. **Eviction Process**:
   - **Protected Group**: There is no mention of an eviction process.
   - **Unprotected Group**: There are instances of the process variant leading to eviction (`Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant`), suggesting a harsher consequence for members of this group.

### Summary of Main Differences
1. **Higher Rejection Rate**: The unprotected group experiences a higher rate of rejection compared to the protected group.
2. **Extensive Screening**: The protected group undergoes more extensive screening processes, which may contribute to their higher acceptance rates and longer tenancy.
3. **Execution Time**: The protected group has higher execution times for their process variants, indicating a more thorough evaluation and potentially better treatment.
4. **Tenancy Outcomes**: The protected group has more favorable tenancy outcomes, with more instances of long-term tenancy leading to multiple rent payments before cancellation. The unprotected group shows a pattern of earlier cancellations and, in some cases, eviction.

These differences highlight potential disparities in treatment, with the protected group receiving more favorable processes and outcomes compared to the unprotected group.
