Let's analyze each case in the event log to identify deviations from the normative process described.

### Case 1:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:** None. This sequence follows the normative process exactly.

### Case 2:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" should occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items." This is a violation.

### Case 3:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:**
  - "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order." According to the normative process, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items" and never after a cancellation.
  - "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order," which is acceptable if the payment is authorized before the inventory check reveals insufficient stock. However, shipping after cancellation is a clear violation.

### Case 4:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order
- **Violation:** None. This sequence follows the normative process exactly for the scenario where inventory is insufficient.

### Case 5:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:**
  - "Ship order" occurs without "Package items." According to the normative process, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items."
  - "Package items" is missing entirely, which is a violation since items must be prepared before they can be shipped.

### Summary of Violations:

1. **Case 2:**
   - **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
   - **Explanation:** The normative process requires "Authorize payment" to occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."

2. **Case 3:**
   - **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
   - **Explanation:** The normative process states that "Ship order" should never occur after a cancellation.

3. **Case 5:**
   - **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs without "Package items."
   - **Explanation:** The normative process requires "Package items" to occur before "Ship order."

These violations highlight deviations from the expected process flow, ensuring that the activities are performed in the correct sequence and under the appropriate conditions.
