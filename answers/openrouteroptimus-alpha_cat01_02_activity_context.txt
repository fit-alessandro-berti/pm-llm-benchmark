Let's tackle each part of the task step by step.

---

**Step 1: Identify and Interpret Recurring Activities**

The following activities appear more than once within the same case:
- **Verify Documents** (appears twice per case in C001 and C003)
- **Call Customer** (appears twice in C002; also appears in all cases, but sometimes only once per case)

Let’s analyze their context and how their meaning changes:

---

**A. ‘Verify Documents’**

- **C001, 1st occurrence:**  
    - Time: 09:20 - AFTER Initiate Request  
    - Context: "Agent checks identity documents."  
    - Meaning: **First-time validation/check of submitted docs.**

- **C001, 2nd occurrence:**  
    - Time: 10:30 - AFTER customer submits additional/missing docs  
    - Context: "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided."  
    - Meaning: **Follow-up verification, specifically to review resubmitted/missing docs.**

- **C003, 1st occurrence:**  
    - "Physical verification of ID." (just after walk-in)  
    - Meaning: **Initial in-person document check.**

- **C003, 2nd occurrence:**  
    - "Re-verify docs after account adjustment."  
    - Meaning: **Verification after changes made in response to earlier problems.**

---

**B. ‘Call Customer’**

- **C001:** Once, right after initial verification fails (to request missing docs).  
- **C002, 1st occurrence:** After initial verification (to clarify account discrepancy, not docs).  
- **C002, 2nd occurrence:** After ‘Adjust Account’ (to confirm the adjustments).  
- **C003:** Only once; after initial verification, to request customer return since they stepped out.

In **C002**, the two calls have distinct purposes:  
- First is for clarification/dispute.  
- Second is for confirming changes.

**Step 2: Contextual Renaming**

We’ll create more descriptive names for the recurring activities, using their sequence, context, and intent.

---

- **Verify Documents**  
    - *Initial* (first time; verifying docs after ingestion)  
    - *Re-Verify After Additional Submission* (after customer uploads missing/documents)  
    - *Re-Verify After Account Adjustment* (after account correction)  

(We may want to encode the reason for the second occurrence.)

- **Call Customer**  
    - *Request Missing Documents*  
    - *Clarify Account Discrepancy*  
    - *Confirm Account Adjustments*  
    - *Recall Customer to Branch*

**Step 3: Revised Event Log**

Below is the revised log with renamed activities (only ‘Activity’ column changed).  
**New activity names are in ALL CAPS for clarity.**

```

**Step 4: Justification of Naming Choices**

- **‘Verify Documents’**  
  - **Initial Document Verification**: Used when this is the first validation step after request initiation, in all cases.
  - **Re-Verify Documents After Additional Submission**: For C001, this second verification explicitly occurs after the customer uploads missing docs.
  - **Re-Verify Documents After Account Adjustment**: In C003, this second check is necessitated by corrections to the account.
  - **Initial Physical Document Verification**: For C003, distinguishes in-person verification at a branch.

- **‘Call Customer’**  
  - **Call Customer to Request Missing Documents**: C001, naturally follows an incomplete document submission.
  - **Call Customer to Clarify Account Discrepancy**: C002, first call about account issues rather than documents.
  - **Call Customer to Confirm Account Adjustment**: C002 second call; it’s a follow-up checking customer’s awareness of report changes.
  - **Call Customer to Return to Branch**: C003, context is about physically returning, not document issues.

- **‘Submit Additional’**  
  - **Submit Additional Documents**: Clarifies that the submission concerns new or corrected documentation.

- **‘Adjust Account’**  
  - **Adjust Account Details** / **Adjust Account Due to Missing Information**: Disambiguates why and what is being adjusted.

- **‘Approve Request’**  
  - Retained as is, since its meaning is consistent and unambiguous.
