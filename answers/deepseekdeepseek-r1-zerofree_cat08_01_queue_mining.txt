## Queue Identification and Characterization

### Queue Identification and Waiting Time Calculation
Waiting time can be defined as the time spent by a patient between the end of one activity and the start of the next within a single case ID. For instance, if a patient completes "Registration" at 09:08:45 and starts "Nurse Assessment" at 09:15:20, the waiting time is:
$$
\text{09:15:20} - \text{09:08:45} = 6 \text{ minutes and 35 seconds} \text{ (approx. 6.58 minutes)}.
$$
This reasoning should be applied iteratively for each pair of consecutive activities within each case ID.

### Key Metrics for Queue Characterization:
1. **Average waiting time for consecutive activity pairs.**
2. **Median waiting time.**
3. **Maximum waiting time.**
4. **90th percentile waiting time.**
5. **Queue frequency (occurrences of a specific queue).**
6. **Number of cases where waiting time exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 30 minutes).**

### Identifying Critical Queues:
1. **Longest average waiting time.**
2. **Queue frequency (highest occurrences cause for concern).**
3. **Impact on overall visit duration.**
4. **Absolute waiting time greater than a "tolerable threshold".**
5. **Discrepancies based on patient type or urgency (e.g., waits for "New" vs. "'Follow-up" patients).**

## Root Cause Analysis

### Potential Root Causes:
1. **Resource Bottlenecks:**
    - Staff availability (e.g., Nurse 1 vs. Nurse 2).
    - Room/equipment utilization (e.g., "Room 3").
    
2. **Activity Dependencies and Handovers:**
    - Identify if activities can be parallelized instead of being strictly sequential.
    
3. **Variability in Activity Durations:**
    - High variability durations like "Doctor Consultation" times could cause queues.
    
4. **Appointment Scheduling Policies:**
    - Uneven distribution of appointments throughout the day.
    
5. **Patient Arrival Patterns:**
    - Recorded "Registration" start times can show peak hours.
    
6. **Patient Type and Urgency:**
    - Analyze if "New" vs. "Follow-up" cases or "Normal" vs. "Urgent" cases show varying waiting times.

### Process Mining Techniques:
    - Use resource analysis for staff or room utilization.
    - Bottleneck analysis to identify stages where delays occur most frequently.
    - Variant analysis to understand different paths patients might take and their associated waiting times.

## Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Revising Resource Allocation or Schedules
**Targeted Queue(s):** Likely "Nurse Assessment" or "Doctor Consultation."
**Root Cause:** Resource bottlenecks where some staff are overworked.
**Data/Analysis Support:** Analyze if "Nurse 1" is overutilized while "Nurse 2" is underutilized.
**Potential Positive Impact:**
    - 35% reduction in "Nurse Assessment" wait time.
    - 20% reduction in "Doctor Consultation" wait time.

### Strategy 2: Modifying Appointment Scheduling Logic
**Targeted Queue(s):** Overall patient flow and "Registration" queues.
**Root Cause:** Clustered appointments causing peak demand.
**Data/Analysis Support:** Redistribute appointment slots evenly.
**Potential Positive Impact:**
    - 25% reduction in "Arrival to Registration" wait time.

### Strategy 3: Redesigning Patient Flow (Parallelizing Activities)
**Targeted Queue(s):** "Doctor Consultation" to "ECG Test."
**Root Cause:** Activity dependencies and handovers.
**Data/Analysis Support:** Schedule "ECG Test" earlier if not strictly required post-consultation.
**Potential Positive Impact:**
    - 30% reduction in "Doctor Consultation to Check-out" segment.

## Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints

### Trade-offs and Negative Side Effects:
1. **Shifting Bottlenecks Elsewhere:**
    - For instance, if "Doctor Consultation" is relieved, "Check-out" might become a new bottleneck.
    
2. **Increased Operational Costs:**
    - Adding staff or equipment might solve a bottleneck but increase costs.
    
3. **Staff Workload and Quality of Care:**
    - Spreading out workloads might make some staff feel overburdened while others feel underutilized.
    - Parallelizing activities might lead to logistical challenges and potential quality of care issues.

### Balancing Conflicting Objectives:
    - Reducing wait times might require additional staff or equipment, thus increasing costs.
    - Parallelizing activities should be validated to ensure that it does not compromise the quality of care.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. **Average waiting time for key activity pairs.**
2. **Total visit duration.**
3. **Patient satisfaction scores.**
4. **Resource utilization rates.**
5. **Average holding cost per patient.**

### Ongoing Process Monitoring:
1. **Monitor KPIs weekly or monthly.**
2. **Conduct repeated queue mining analyses quarterly.**
3. **Utilize real-time analytics for dynamic resource allocation and immediate issue resolution.**
