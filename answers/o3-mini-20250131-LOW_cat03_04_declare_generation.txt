Below is one possible Python dictionary representation of a DECLARE model for the multidepartment product design and launch process. In this example, we specify some rules for the activities (using their abbreviations) that reflect the typical process flow while keeping the defined structure. (Note that the exact support and confidence values may be adjusted based on real data, and you may add or remove constraints as needed.)

For example:
• The key "existence" is used to require that a given activity must occur in a process instance.
• The "init" constraint forces the process to start with Idea Generation (IG).
• Other constraints such as "response" and "precedence" have been assumed to capture the ordering between activities (for instance, if a design is drafted then a technical feasibility check should eventually follow, etc.)

Here is one valid Python dictionary:

# You can then use this dictionary in pm4py's DECLARE model routines.
