### Assumptions and Notes:
1. **Order Creation**: The `order_date` from the `Orders` table is used as the timestamp for the "Order Created" event. The salesperson responsible for the order is included as the resource.
2. **Item Picking**: Each row in the `Order Lines` table generates an "Item Picked" event. The `item_picking_date` is used as the timestamp, and the picker is included as the resource.
3. **Order Dispatched and Arrived**: Each row in the `Delivery` table generates two events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived". The carrier is included as the resource.
4. **Invoice Issued**: Each row in the `Invoice` table generates an "Invoice Issued" event. The `invoice_issue_date` is used as the timestamp, and the billing clerk is included as the resource.
5. **Payment Received**: Each row in the `Payments` table generates a "Payment Received" event. The payment method is included as the resource.
6. **Chronological Order**: Events are sorted by timestamp within each `order_id`.

This event log captures all relevant activities for each order, ensuring completeness and chronological accuracy.
