Below are the key anomalies identified, with explanations on why each is problematic in a Procure-to-Pay process:

1. Case 1002:
•Anomaly: The Purchase Order is issued before the Purchase Requisition is approved. In a typical P2P process, the requisition must be approved to validate the need for ordering. Issuing a PO before approval can lead to orders being placed without proper internal authorization.
•Anomaly: The payment is released before the goods are received. Payment generally follows after confirming that the delivered goods meet specifications. Releasing payment prematurely risks paying for goods that might not be received or may not meet quality standards.
•Why problematic: These deviations could lead to financial exposure, lack of control over ordering processes, and potential disputes with vendors over product delivery or quality.

2. Case 1003:
•Anomaly: The payment is released prior to the vendor invoice being received and before the goods are received. Standard practice requires validating the invoice against the PO and confirming goods receipt (often through matching) before authorizing payment.
•Why problematic: Releasing payment too early undermines financial controls. It increases the risk of paying incorrect amounts or paying for items that have not yet been delivered, potentially resulting in lost funds or the need for subsequent recovery efforts.

3. Case 1004:
•Anomaly: The goods are received before the Purchase Order is issued. Normally, a PO is sent to the vendor well in advance of goods delivery to ensure that the order is coordinated and documented.
•Why problematic: Receiving goods without a prior PO can lead to process inconsistencies, difficulties in tracking vendor commitments, and issues with invoice reconciliation. It may also signal communication problems or a lack of oversight within the purchasing process.

In summary, each of these anomalies indicates a breakdown in standard controls and sequencing. Properly structured Procure-to-Pay processes are vital to ensure accountability, reduce risks of fraud or error, and maintain clear audit trails. Deviations such as out-of-order approvals, premature payments, or misaligned ordering and receiving activities expose businesses to risk and can disrupt both financial and operational processes.
