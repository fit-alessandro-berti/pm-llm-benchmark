To identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the given event log, we need to look for activities that do not follow the assumed normal process flow. Here are some potential anomalies:

1. **Unordered Activities**: Events that occur out of sequence relative to the expected order.
2. **Missing Steps**: Some steps that should have occurred but did not (e.g., `Perform Credit Check` before `Register Order`).
3. **Reversed Steps**: Events where a step is performed after another step that logically should come later in the process flow.

### Anomalies Identified

1. **Case 1002**:
   - The event sequence does not follow the expected order: 
     - `Register Order`, `Confirm Shipment`, `Ship Goods`, `Perform Credit Check`, `Validate Stock`, `Issue Invoice`, `Receive Payment`.
     - This case has the `Credit Check` step before the `Shipment Confirmation` and `Stock Validation`.

2. **Case 1004**:
   - The event sequence is also not in order:
     - The `Confirm Shipment` and `Ship Goods` steps are completed before the `Perform Credit Check`, which should logically come first.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

- **System Errors**: Possible technical issues causing events to be recorded out of order.
- **Policy Violations**: Policies might have been violated, leading to incorrect sequences in event records.
- **Training Issues**: Staff might not be adequately trained, resulting in errors or skipping steps.

### SQL Queries to Investigate Hypotheses

1. **Identify Unordered Activities**:
   ```sql
   -- Find cases where the Confirm Shipment step occurs before Perform Credit Check
   SELECT case_id 
   FROM order_event_log 
   WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND event_id > (
       SELECT MIN(event_id) 
       FROM order_event_log 
       WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND case_id = o.event_log.case_id
   );
   
   -- Find cases where Ship Goods step occurs before Validate Stock
   SELECT case_id 
   FROM order_event_log 
   WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods' AND event_id < (
       SELECT MIN(event_id) 
       FROM order_event_log 
       WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock' AND case_id = o.event_log.case_id
   );
   ```

2. **Identify Missing Steps**:
   ```sql
   -- Check for cases where Perform Credit Check is missing between Register Order and Validate Stock
   SELECT case_id 
   FROM order_event_log 
   WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock' AND event_id < (
       SELECT MIN(event_id) 
       FROM order_event_log 
       WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
       AND timestamp < o.event_log.timestamp
       AND case_id = o.event_log.case_id
   ) AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 
       FROM order_event_log sub
       WHERE sub.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' 
       AND sub.timestamp < o.event_log.timestamp 
       AND sub.case_id = o.event_log.case_id
   );
   
   -- Check for cases where Confirm Shipment is missing between Ship Goods and Validate Stock
   SELECT case_id 
   FROM order_event_log 
   WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock' AND event_id < (
       SELECT MIN(event_id) 
       FROM order_event_log 
       WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
       AND timestamp < o.event_log.timestamp
       AND case_id = o.event_log.case_id
   ) AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 
       FROM order_event_log sub
       WHERE sub.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
       AND sub.timestamp < o.event_log.timestamp 
       AND sub.case_id = o.event_log.case_id
   );
   ```

3. **Identify Reversed Steps**:
   ```sql
   -- Find cases where Perform Credit Check occurs before Register Order
   SELECT case_id 
   FROM order_event_log 
   WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND event_id < (
       SELECT MIN(event_id) 
       FROM order_event_log 
       WHERE activity = 'Register Order'
       AND timestamp < o.event_log.timestamp
       AND case_id = o.event_log.case_id
   ) AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 
       FROM order_event_log sub
       WHERE sub.activity = 'Register Order' 
       AND sub.timestamp < o.event_log.timestamp 
       AND sub.case_id = o.event_log.case_id
   );
   
   -- Find cases where Confirm Shipment occurs before Ship Goods
   SELECT case_id 
   FROM order_event_log 
   WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND event_id < (
       SELECT MIN(event_id) 
       FROM order_event_log 
       WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
       AND timestamp < o.event_log.timestamp
       AND case_id = o.event_log.case_id
   ) AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 
       FROM order_event_log sub
       WHERE sub.activity = 'Ship Goods' 
       AND sub.timestamp < o.event_log.timestamp 
       AND sub.case_id = o.event_log.case_id
   );
   ```

These queries should help identify the anomalies and provide insights into possible causes, such as system errors or training issues.
