Where does the bias come in?  
•Everyone passes through Preliminary Scoring (C).  
•Immediately afterwards the XOR operator makes an all-or-nothing choice:

– Branch 1: “Check Local Affiliation” (D)  
• If the applicant is a resident of the bank’s home town and member of a recognised community group, D is executed.  
• The result of D is a small, systematic score uplift (“subtle score uplift” in the code comment).  

– Branch 2: “skip”  
• All other applicants bypass D and go straight to Manual Review (E) with no uplift.

Thus the process awards additional credit only to applicants who satisfy a criterion that is *not* tied to credit-worthiness itself; it is simply geographic/affiliation information.

Why this is problematic

1. Hidden disparate treatment  
   • Two applicants with identical financial characteristics but different addresses can receive different scores because one of them happens to live in the “right” neighbourhood or belong to the “right” club.  
   • This is a facially neutral rule, but it conditions treatment on group membership, which is classic disparate treatment.

2. Proxy discrimination / disparate impact  
   • Neighbourhood, ZIP code and local clubs are highly correlated with race, ethnicity, wealth and other legally protected traits.  
   • Even if “local affiliation” is not itself a protected class, the uplift can replicate the same patterns as redlining: people who live outside the favoured area—often minorities or lower-income populations—systematically lose credit points.  
   • Statistical fairness tests (e.g. demographic parity, equal opportunity) will likely show worse outcomes for the groups that are under-represented in the “local” branch.

3. Equity concerns  
   • The branch creates an asymmetric chance to improve the score: some applicants can only hold their score steady (they pass through “skip”), while others can *increase* it.  
   • Because the uplift is added after the main scoring step, it is not visible to the standard risk model and is hard to justify with a business-necessity argument.

4. Regulatory risk  
   • In many jurisdictions (e.g. U.S. Equal Credit Opportunity Act, EU consumer-credit directives) using geographic information that correlates with protected classes triggers regulatory scrutiny, even if the variable itself is not protected.  
   • Lack of transparency: customers who receive a lower score will not be told that “non-membership in the local club” was the reason, hampering the adverse-action explanation requirement.

Potential impact on final decisions

Suppose the preliminary model assigns a score of 680 to both Alice (local resident) and Bob (non-local). D adds +10 points, so Alice ends at 690—above the approval cut-off of 685—while Bob ends at 680 and is rejected. A seemingly innocuous XOR branch has turned location into the decisive factor, overriding identical financial risk profiles.

Mitigation strategies

• Remove the XOR altogether, or run D for *all* applicants when predictive evidence shows it genuinely improves risk assessment.  
• Quantitatively audit the uplift for disparate impact before deployment; adjust or neutralise it if protected groups are harmed.  
• Replace “local affiliation” with a variable that captures real repayment behaviour, or cap the magnitude of any uplift.  
• Provide transparency: if the criterion is kept, the bank must be prepared to explain and defend why it is a business necessity, not an arbitrary preference.

In short, the XOR branch introduces a subtle but systematic bias by giving one subset of applicants extra credit for an attribute that is only loosely related to risk and strongly correlated with protected characteristics. Without correction, the process undermines fairness and can expose the institution to ethical and legal challenges.
