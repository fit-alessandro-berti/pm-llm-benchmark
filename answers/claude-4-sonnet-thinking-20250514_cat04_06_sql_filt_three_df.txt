Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Find cases with the exact sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' in direct succession
2. Among those, identify cases where 'Create Order' to 'Confirm Order' timing > 5 days  
3. Exclude all events from those cases

Here's my solution using window functions:

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LAG(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_prev_activity,
    LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity,
    LAG(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_timestamp
  FROM event_log
),
sequence_events AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    prev_timestamp as create_order_time,
    timestamp as confirm_order_time
  FROM ordered_events
  WHERE prev_prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND prev_activity = 'Create Order'
    AND activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM sequence_events
  WHERE confirm_order_time - create_order_time > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 
  FROM cases_to_exclude cte 
  WHERE cte.case_id = event_log.case_id
);
```

**How it works:**

1. **`ordered_events`**: Uses `LAG()` functions to look back at the previous 2 activities and the timestamp of the previous activity for each event, ordered by timestamp within each case.

2. **`sequence_events`**: Identifies events where the current activity is 'Confirm Order' and the two preceding activities are 'Create Order' and 'Approve Purchase Requisition' respectively, ensuring the exact sequence in direct succession.

3. **`cases_to_exclude`**: From the identified sequences, filters to only those cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.

4. **Final SELECT**: Returns all events from the original table except those belonging to the excluded cases, using `NOT EXISTS` for reliable exclusion (avoiding potential NULL issues with `NOT IN`).

The query handles multiple occurrences of the sequence within the same case correctly - if any occurrence meets both criteria, the entire case is excluded.
