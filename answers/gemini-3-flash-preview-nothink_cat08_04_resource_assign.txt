As a Process Improvement Consultant, I will utilize a process-mining-centric approach to transform TechSolve’s incident management from a reactive, manual-driven process into a proactive, data-optimized operation.

### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To understand the current state, we must move beyond aggregate averages and look at the "digital footprint" of every resource interaction.

*   **Metric Definition & Tier Performance:**
    *   **Workload Distribution:** I will calculate the "Work-in-Progress" (WIP) per agent over time. This identifies if specific agents are "magnets" for tickets while others remain idle.
    *   **Activity Processing Time (Net vs. Gross):** By comparing `Work Start` and `Work End` (Net) against the time the ticket sat in an agent's queue (Wait Time), we can distinguish between resource capacity issues and technical complexity issues.
    *   **First-Call Resolution (FCR) & Skill Alignment:** I will calculate the percentage of tickets resolved by the first assigned L1 agent. Crucially, I will cross-reference `Required Skill` with `Agent Skills` to see how often L1s are assigned tickets they are not equipped to handle.

*   **Process Mining Techniques:**
    *   **Social Network Analysis (Handover of Work):** I will generate a handover map to visualize how tickets flow between agents. This will reveal "Ping-Pong" effects (tickets bouncing between L2 agents) and "Bottleneck Resources" (individuals who receive many tickets but have few outgoing transfers).
    *   **Role Discovery:** Using the event log, I will perform cluster analysis to see if agents' *actual* work matches their *assigned* tier. This reveals "Shadow L2s"—L1 agents who are effectively performing high-level work without the title, or L3s performing repetitive L1 tasks.
    *   **Resource-Activity Matrix:** This identifies which agents are "specialists" vs. "generalists" by mapping resource IDs to `Ticket Category`.

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

By overlaying performance data onto the process map, we can pinpoint precisely where the tiered structure is failing.

*   **The "Skill Gap" Bottleneck:** I will identify cases where `Wait Time` is high for specific `Required Skills` (e.g., 'Security-IAM'). If tickets are stuck in "Assign L2" for 4 hours whenever 'Database-SQL' is required, we have a clear capacity shortage for that specific skill.
*   **The Cost of Reassignment:** Every `Reassign` event adds "frictional delay." I will quantify the **Reassignment Penalty**: the average increase in cycle time for every additional resource involved. For TechSolve, I suspect a ticket with >2 reassignments has a 70% higher chance of an SLA breach.
*   **Initial Assignment Accuracy:** By analyzing the "Activity" sequence, I will flag cases where L1 "Work Start" lasts <5 minutes followed immediately by "Escalate L2." This indicates the L1 agent realized immediately they couldn't handle it—suggesting the ticket should have been routed directly to L2.
*   **Overload-Error Correlation:** I will correlate an agent's current queue length with their "reopening rate." Overloaded agents often "resolve" tickets prematurely to clear their queue, leading to re-opened incidents.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

We must determine *why* the assignments are failing using advanced mining techniques.

*   **Variant Analysis:** I will compare the "Happy Path" (Tickets resolved within SLA with <2 agents) against "Non-Compliant Paths."
    *   *Hypothesis:* Do P2/P3 breaches occur because they are consistently "bumped" by P1s in a round-robin queue?
    *   *Hypothesis:* Are reassignments caused by the dispatcher having outdated info on who is actually "online" vs. "active"?
*   **Decision Mining:** I will analyze the "Escalate L2" decision point. By looking at data attributes (Category, Priority, Channel), I can identify if certain categories (e.g., 'Software-App') are *always* escalated. If L1 escalates 'App-CRM' 95% of the time, the root cause is a flawed routing rule that sends CRM tickets to L1 at all.
*   **Attribute Analysis:** I will investigate if the `Channel` (Phone vs. Web Portal) impacts assignment quality. Often, phone incidents are assigned to whoever is "next," while portal tickets allow for better automated keyword matching.

### 4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

Based on the findings, I propose the following three strategies:

#### Strategy A: Intelligent Skill-Based Routing (SBR)
*   **Issue:** Specialists doing L1 work and frequent reassignments due to skill mismatch.
*   **Logic:** Replace round-robin with a "Best Fit" algorithm. When a ticket is created, the system matches the `Required Skill` against the `Agent Skill` database and assigns it to the agent with the highest proficiency who is currently below a specific workload threshold.
*   **Data Required:** Updated Agent Skill Matrix (with 1-5 proficiency levels) and real-time WIP counts.
*   **Benefit:** Reduced reassignments by ensuring the first agent has the technical capability to resolve the ticket.

#### Strategy B: Predictive Triage & "Fast-Tracking"
*   **Issue:** High SLA breaches for P2/P3 due to "L1 hop" delays.
*   **Logic:** Use historical process data to identify "High-Escalation Signatures" (e.g., Priority=P2 + Category=Network + Keyword="Firewall"). These tickets bypass L1 entirely and move directly to an L2 specialist queue.
*   **Data Required:** Historical event logs (to train the prediction) and NLP-extracted keywords from ticket descriptions.
*   **Benefit:** Eliminates the 30–60 minute "L1 triage delay," directly protecting the SLA of high-priority tickets.

#### Strategy C: Dynamic Load Balancing (Threshold-Based)
*   **Issue:** Uneven workload and "bottleneck" agents.
*   **Logic:** Implement "Concurrency Limits" per tier. If an L2 specialist reaches 5 active tickets, the system automatically redirects incoming P3 tickets to a "Secondary Skill" pool (L1 agents with high potential/training in that area) to prevent a total standstill.
*   **Data Required:** Real-time "Active" status from the event log and agent availability.
*   **Benefit:** Smooths out the workload, preventing "Hero Culture" (where one agent does everything) and reducing burnout/delays.

### 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

#### Simulation (Pre-Implementation)
Before changing the live system, I will use **BPMN-based Simulation**:
1.  Import the "As-Is" process model into a simulation engine.
2.  Input the "To-Be" assignment rules (e.g., Skill-Based Routing).
3.  Run one year of historical ticket volume through the new rules.
4.  Compare results: If the simulation shows a 20% reduction in cycle time and 15% fewer SLA breaches, we proceed to implementation.

#### Implementation & Monitoring (Post-Implementation)
I will deploy a **Process Mining Dashboard** for real-time monitoring with the following KPIs:
*   **Resource Utilization Index:** A heat map showing agent busy-ness vs. idle time.
*   **Skill-Match Accuracy:** % of tickets resolved by an agent whose skills matched the `Required Skill` attribute.
*   **Handover Multiplier:** A real-time count of how many agents touch a ticket. A spike in this metric triggers an immediate alert for management to investigate "Ping-Ponging."
*   **SLA-at-Risk View:** A process view showing tickets that have had >1 reassignment and are within 25% of their SLA limit.

By implementing this loop—analyze, strategize, simulate, and monitor—TechSolve will shift from a blind assignment logic to a precision-engineered resource management system.
