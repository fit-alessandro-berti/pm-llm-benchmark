**BPMN-like Textual Process Model of Invoice Approval Process**

**1. Activities/Tasks:**
- **Verify PO Number Existence**

- **Log Invoice into Accounting System**

- **Forward to Purchasing Department**

- **Compare PO and Invoice Line Items** (quantities, prices, delivery charges)

- **Contact Supplier/Investigate** (Dan/Karen)

- **Reconcile PO and Invoice in System**

- **Forward to Department Manager for Approval**

- **Schedule Payment via Accounting System**

- **Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**

- **Resolve Informal Contract/Backlog Exception** (e.g., retrospective PO, contract formalization)

**2. Sequence Flow:**
- **Start Event:** Invoice arrived via email  
   **Verify PO Number Existence** (Gateway 1)  
    **Yes:**  
       **Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
         **Forward to Purchasing Department (Dan)**  
           **Compare PO and Invoice Line Items** (Activity 4)  
            **Discrepancies Found (Gateway 2):**  
              **Yes:**  
                 **Contact Supplier/Investigate** (Dan/Karen)  
                   [After resolution]  **Reconcile PO and Invoice in System**  
              **No:**  **Reconcile PO and Invoice in System**  
            **After Reconciliation/No Discrepancies:**  
               **Forward to Department Manager (Carlos)**  
                 **/ (Approve/Reject)**  
                  **Approve:**  **Schedule Payment**  
                  **Reject:**  **Escalate to Rita**  
    **No:**  
       **Escalate to Rita**  
         **Resolve Informal Contract/Backlog Exception** (e.g., retrospective PO)  
           **Verify PO Now Existent** (Gateway 4)  
            **Yes:**  **Log Invoice into Accounting System** (reengage process)  

**3. Gateways/Decision Points:**  
- **Gateway 1: PO Existence Check**  
  - Condition: Valid PO number present?  
  - Paths:  
    - Yes: Proceed normally.  
    - No:Escalate to Rita for exception handling.  

- **Gateway 2: Discrepancies Found**  
  - Condition: Any mismatch between PO and invoice?  
  - Paths:  
    - Yes: Resolve via supplier interaction.  
    - No: Proceed to manager approval.  

- **Gateway 3: Manager Approval Status**  
  - Condition: Is invoice approved?  
  - Paths:  
    - Yes: Schedule payment.  
    - No: Escalate to Rita for re NPCs.  

- **Gateway 4: Retrospective PO Validity**  
  - Condition: Is retrospective PO formalized?  
  - Paths:  
    - Yes: Reinterpret omission as valid PO.  
    - No: Continue escalating to senior management.  

**4. Roles/Participants:**  
- **Accounts Payable (AP):** Mary (clerk), Rita (supervisor)  
- **Purchasing (Dan):** PO/invoice reconciliation  
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Final approval/rejection  
- **Supplier (Karen):** Resolving discrepancies via contract terms  
- **Supervisor (Rita):** Exception handling (no PO, unresolved conflicts)  

**5. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**  
- **Input:** Invoice (email), PO reference  
- **Output:** Payment schedule, PO record (formalized), system log entries  
- **Data Objects:**  
  - `PO_Number`  
  - `Invoice_Line_Items`  
  - `Supplier_Contracted unit Price`  
  - `Manager_ApprovalAndHashCode`

**6. Exceptions/Variations:**  
- **Missing PO Paths:**  
  - Normal: Mary requests from supplier after Gateway 1.  
  - Informal: Rita retroactively formalizes contracts (Gateway 4).  
- **Rework Loops:**  
  1. Purchasingographically-driven discrepancies (Dan/Karen intervention).  
  2. Manager rejection requiring resubmission to Rita.  
- **Special Conditions:**  
  - Discrepancies exceeding purchasing’s resolution authority  Rita’s direct supplier outreach.  
  - Budget anomalies (Carlos rejects due to pricing/budget mismatch with control overrides).  

**7. Ambiguities/Inconsistencies:**  
- **Process ownership after Manager rejection:** Rita ensures flow, but Carlos retains authority to reject informally.  
- **Supplier notification triggers:** Not explicitly stated in transcripts. Need to clarify if Karen’s involvement includes system notifications.  
- **Payment scheduling rigor:** Rita mentions scheduling, but no details onECO’s timing/trigger (e.g., daily/qu.
