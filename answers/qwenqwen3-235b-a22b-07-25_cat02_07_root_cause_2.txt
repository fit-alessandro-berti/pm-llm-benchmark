### **1. Identify Cases with Performance Issues**

To determine which cases are taking significantly longer, we calculate the **total lead time** for each case — the duration from **"Submit Claim"** to **"Close Claim"**.

---

#### **Lead Time Calculation:**

| Case ID | Submit Claim (Start)       | Close Claim (End)          | Duration (Lead Time)        |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 2001   | 2024-04-01 09:00           | 2024-04-01 10:30           | **1.5 hours**               |
| 2002   | 2024-04-01 09:05           | 2024-04-02 11:00           | **~25.9 hours**             |
| 2003   | 2024-04-01 09:10           | 2024-04-03 09:30           | **~48.3 hours**             |
| 2004   | 2024-04-01 09:20           | 2024-04-01 10:45           | **1.4 hours**               |
| 2005   | 2024-04-01 09:25           | 2024-04-04 14:30           | **~73.1 hours**             |

---

#### **Observations:**
- **Cases 2001 and 2004** complete within **under 2 hours** — efficient.
- **Case 2002** takes **~26 hours** — delayed, but not extreme.
- **Case 2003** takes **~48 hours** — significantly longer.
- **Case 2005** takes **~73 hours** — **by far the longest**, over **3 days**.

 **Cases with significant performance issues: 2003 and 2005**, with **2005 being the worst**.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis Using Attributes**

We analyze the impact of three key attributes: **Complexity**, **Region**, and **Resource**.

---

#### **A. Impact of Claim Complexity**

| Case ID | Complexity | # of "Request Additional Documents" | Lead Time     |
|--------|------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| 2001   | Low        | 0                                   | 1.5 hrs       |
| 2004   | Low        | 0                                   | 1.4 hrs       |
| 2002   | Medium     | 1                                   | ~26 hrs       |
| 2003   | High       | 2                                   | ~48 hrs       |
| 2005   | High       | 3                                   | ~73 hrs       |

 **Pattern:**
- **Low complexity claims** are processed quickly and **without document requests**.
- **Higher complexity** correlates with:
  - More frequent **"Request Additional Documents"** events.
  - **Longer durations**, especially when **multiple document requests** occur.
- **Case 2005 (High complexity)** has **3 document requests**, indicating **poor initial information capture or unclear documentation requirements**.

 **Conclusion:** **Claim complexity is a strong predictor of long lead times**, primarily because it leads to **iterative information gathering**.

---

#### **B. Impact of Region**

| Region | Cases          | Avg. Lead Time                     |
|--------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| A      | 2001, 2003     | (1.5 + 48.3) / 2 = **~24.9 hrs**   |
| B      | 2002, 2004, 2005 | (26 + 1.4 + 73.1) / 3 = **~33.5 hrs** |

Wait — Region B has **one very fast case (2004)** and **two slow ones (2002, 2005)**.

Let’s **stratify by complexity**:

| Region | Complexity | Avg. Lead Time (within group)       |
|--------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| A      | Low        | 1.5 hrs (2001)                      |
| A      | High       | 48.3 hrs (2003)                     |
| B      | Low        | 1.4 hrs (2004)                      |
| B      | Medium     | 25.9 hrs (2002)                     |
| B      | High       | 73.1 hrs (2005)                     |

 **Observation:**
- For **Low complexity**, both regions perform well.
- For **High complexity**, **Region B (2005)** takes **~25 hours longer** than **Region A (2003)**.
- **Region B** appears to have **worse performance on high-complexity claims**.

 **Conclusion:** While both regions handle simple claims efficiently, **Region B struggles more with complex claims**, suggesting **regional process inefficiencies or resource constraints**.

---

#### **C. Impact of Resource**

Let’s examine **Adjusters** (key role in evaluation and document requests):

| Adjuster       | Cases Handled | # of Document Requests | Avg. Lead Time (for their cases) |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Adjuster_Mike  | 2001, 2003    | 2 (both in 2003)       | (1.5 + 48.3)/2 = **24.9 hrs**   |
| Adjuster_Lisa  | 2002, 2004, 2005 | 4 (1 in 2002, 3 in 2005) | (26 + 1.4 + 73.1)/3 = **33.5 hrs** |

But wait — **Adjuster_Lisa handles more high-complexity cases**, especially 2005.

Let’s look at **document request patterns**:

- **Adjuster_Mike (Region A):**
  - Case 2003 (High): 2 document requests — resolved in **~48 hrs**
- **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B):**
  - Case 2005 (High): **3 document requests**, over **3 days**, closed in **73 hrs**

 **Observation:**
- Both adjusters issue **multiple document requests** for high-complexity claims.
- But **Adjuster_Lisa’s case (2005)** has **more requests and longer delays between them**:
  - First: 2024-04-01 11:30
  - Second: 2024-04-02 17:00 (**~29.5 hrs later**)
  - Third: 2024-04-03 15:00 (**~22 hrs later**)
  - Then approval only on **April 4**

 **Potential issue:** **Delay in follow-up** — suggests **reactive rather than proactive** handling, or **slow response from claimant**, but **no indication claimant delay is tracked**.

Also, **Manager_Bill (approver)** appears in **both slow high-complexity cases (2003 and 2005)**, approving only **after 2+ days** — could be a **bottleneck in approvals**.

| Manager       | Cases         | Approval Delay after last doc request? |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Manager_Ann   | 2001, 2002, 2004 | Approves **same day or next day**     |
| Manager_Bill  | 2003, 2005     | Approves **1–2 days after final doc request** |

In **Case 2005**:
- Last doc request: 2024-04-03 15:00
- Approval: 2024-04-04 10:00  **~19 hrs delay**

 **Manager_Bill may be a bottleneck** for complex claims.

---

### **3. Root Causes & Explanations**

####  **Primary Root Causes:**

1. **Claim Complexity Drives Iterative Document Requests**
   - High-complexity claims trigger **multiple rounds** of document requests.
   - Each round introduces **multi-day delays** — especially if claimant response time isn’t managed.
   - **No evidence of upfront checklist** — leads to **reactive requests**.

2. **Regional Inefficiency in Handling Complex Claims (Region B)**
   - Region B takes **significantly longer** for high-complexity claims.
   - May lack **standardized procedures**, **training**, or **support tools** for complex cases.
   - Adjuster_Lisa’s case shows **prolonged gaps between document requests**, suggesting **poor case follow-up** or **workload issues**.

3. **Approver Bottleneck (Manager_Bill)**
   - Manager_Bill handles **all high-complexity approvals**, and **delays approval** by 1–2 days.
   - May be **overloaded** or lacks **delegation protocols** for urgent claims.

4. **Lack of Proactive Document Collection**
   - No case avoids document requests when complexity is medium/high.
   - Suggests **weak upfront intake process** — CSR does not collect sufficient info at "Submit Claim".

---

### **4. Recommendations to Mitigate Root Causes**

| Root Cause | Suggestion |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Multiple document requests due to complexity** |  **Introduce a dynamic checklist** at submission based on claim type/complexity to **collect all necessary documents upfront**. |
| **Region B underperforms on complex claims** |  **Standardize complex claim handling procedures** across regions. <br>  **Cross-train Region B staff** or **assign a dedicated complex claims team**. <br>  Monitor **Region B performance** with KPIs. |
| **Adjuster follow-up delays** |  **Set SLAs for follow-up actions** (e.g., "If no response in 24 hrs, send reminder"). <br>  Use **automated reminders** in the claims system. |
| **Approver bottleneck (Manager_Bill)** |  **Delegate approval authority** for certain high-complexity claims to other managers. <br>  **Implement escalation rules** if approval is delayed beyond 24 hrs. |
| **Poor initial information capture** |  **Enhance CSR training** on identifying complexity early. <br>  **Use AI or rule-based systems** to flag high-risk claims at intake. |
| **No visibility into claimant response time** |  **Track time between document request and receipt** to identify external vs. internal delays. |

---

###  **Summary**

- **Problematic Cases:** **2003 and 2005**, with **2005 being the worst** due to **3 document requests and 73-hour lead time**.
- **Key Drivers of Delay:**
  - **High complexity**  multiple document requests.
  - **Region B**  slower handling of complex claims.
  - **Manager_Bill**  delayed approvals.
  - **Lack of proactive document collection** and **follow-up gaps**.

 **Solution Focus:** **Prevention (better intake), standardization (by region), automation (reminders), and delegation (approval bottleneck)** will significantly reduce lead times, especially for high-complexity claims.
