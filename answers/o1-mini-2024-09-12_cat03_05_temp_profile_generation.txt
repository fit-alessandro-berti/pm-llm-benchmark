**Explanation:**

- **Directly Connected Pairs:** These represent activities that follow one another in immediate succession within the process. For example, after **Order Placement (OP)**, the next activity is **Receive Components (RC)**.

- **Multi-Step Separated Pairs:** These pairs involve activities that are separated by one or more intermediate steps. For instance, **Supplier Selection (SS)** to **Receive Components (RC)** skips the **Order Placement (OP)** step.

- **Time Units:** All time values are in **seconds**.
  - For clarity:
    - **1 day** = 86,400 seconds
    - **1 hour** = 3,600 seconds

- **Estimation Rationale:**
  - **Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP):** Typically involves decision-making and administrative processes, estimated around 2 days on average with some variability.
  
  - **Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC):** Includes order processing and supplier lead times, estimated at 3 days on average.
  
  - **Receive Components (RC) to Quality Inspection (QI):** Generally follows immediately after receipt, estimated at 1 day.
  
  - **Quality Inspection (QI) to Component Assembly (CA):** Ensures quality before assembly, estimated at 2 days.
  
  - **Component Assembly (CA) to Product Testing (PT):** Assembly completion leads to testing, estimated at 1 day.
  
  - **Product Testing (PT) to Packaging (PK):** Post-testing, packaging occurs, estimated at 12 hours.
  
  - **Packaging (PK) to Warehouse Storage (WS):** Packaged goods are stored, estimated at 1 day.
  
  - **Warehouse Storage (WS) to Distribution (DT):** Stored products are then distributed, estimated at 3 days.
  
  - **Distribution (DT) to After-Sales Support (AS):** Post-distribution support phase, estimated at 7 days.

- **Standard Deviation (STDEV):** Represents the variability in the time between activities, accounting for factors like delays, efficiency variations, and unforeseen issues.

This temporal profile provides a structured overview of the expected timings between various activities in the supply chain process, aiding in performance monitoring and anomaly detection.
