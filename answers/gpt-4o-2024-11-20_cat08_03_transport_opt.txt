### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

#### **1.1 Data Preprocessing and Integration**
To prepare the data for process mining, we need to combine the event data from the various sources (GPS, scanner, dispatch, maintenance logs) into a cohesive event log. Here’s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Key Elements of an Event Log:**
   - *Case IDs:* Each vehicle-day combination (e.g., V12-20241205) serves as the primary Case ID, as it captures all activities that occur for a specific vehicle during an operational day.
   - *Activities:* Events from all subsystems (e.g., "Depart Depot," "Delivery Success," "Unscheduled Stop").
   - *Timestamps:* Each event’s corresponding timestamp.
   - *Optional Attributes:* Driver, location (latitude/longitude), package IDs, vehicle status, speed, and maintenance notes.

2. **Steps to Integrate Data:**
   - *Data Alignment:* Standardize timestamps across data sources and align them to the same time zone.
   - *Event Matching:* Match GPS events with scanner and dispatch events (e.g., use timestamps and geolocation to correlate "Arrive Customer" from the scanner with nearby "Low Speed Detected" from GPS).
   - *Handling Missing Data:* Impute missing data where appropriate (e.g., missing GPS logs due to connectivity issues) or treat them explicitly as exceptions.
   - *Validation for Completeness:* Ensure that all planned events from the dispatch system (package destinations, exact routes) have corresponding actual events (e.g., deliveries, travel) and flag missing or incomplete cases.

#### **Challenges in Data Integration:**
   - Inconsistencies between systems (e.g., mismatched timestamps, discrepancies in planned vs. actual routes).
   - Geospatial data processing (e.g., converting raw lat/long coordinates into meaningful labels like "near Depot" or "Customer Location").
   - Differentiating events with similar geolocations but different contexts (e.g., arriving at the depot vs. departing from it).

#### **1.2 Process Discovery**
Using process mining tools (e.g., Celonis, Disco, ProM), the actual end-to-end process model can be extracted from the event log. Here's how:
   - Apply a **process discovery algorithm** like the Inductive Miner to visualize the delivery workflow. This will cover activities like:
     - "Start Shift"  "Depart Depot"  "Arrive Customer"  "Delivery Success/Failed"  "Return Depot"  "End Shift."
     - Include exceptional paths (e.g., unscheduled stops due to maintenance or failed delivery attempts).
   - Incorporate timestamp-based information to analyze the time spent on each activity (e.g., driving, delivery, idle times).

The resulting process model provides a visual map of what actually happens in the last-mile delivery process.

#### **1.3 Conformance Checking**
Planned routes (dispatch data) serve as the reference process model. We would compare the planned vs. discovered processes to detect deviations. Conformance checking techniques reveal:
   - **Sequence deviations** (e.g., delivering stops out of order compared to the planned route).
   - **Unplanned events:** Unscheduled stops, maintenance detours, or excessive idle time.
   - **Timing deviations:** Checking adherence to planned delivery windows, delays in departure from the depot, and longer-than-expected service times.

The key outcome is to identify deviation patterns that negatively affect punctuality and efficiency. For example:
   - Vehicles spending significant time on unscheduled stops or traffic hotspots.
   - Drivers routinely failing to adhere to the planned route order.
   - Delayed delivery attempts due to inaccurate time window predictions.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

#### **2.1 Relevant KPIs**
Key KPIs for Speedy Parcels include:
   - **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of deliveries completed within the promised time window.
   - **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** (Total delivery time / Number of successful deliveries). This isolates inefficiencies in service times.
   - **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Ratio of drive time to customer interaction/service time.
   - **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Duration the vehicle is actively used per its shift.
   - **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Calculated using GPS mileage vs. number of successful deliveries.
   - **Traffic Delay Frequency/Duration:** Derived from GPS speed patterns (low-speed detections).
   - **Failed Delivery Rate:** Percentage of deliveries that fail on the first attempt.

#### **2.2 Bottleneck Identification**
Using process mining techniques like performance analysis (e.g., time-based heatmaps, process path duration comparison):
   - Identify delays at specific activities (e.g., long dwell times at customer locations during "Delivery Failed" events).
   - Detect hotspots in geospatial data causing excessive idle or low-speed time (e.g., traffic congestion zones).
   - Analyze variance by driver, vehicle, or route to see patterns in inefficiency (e.g., stops prioritized incorrectly, varying customer service times).
   - Quantify disruptions, such as unscheduled stops for maintenance or unexpected traffic, and measure their impact on overall KPIs.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

#### **Potential Root Causes and Validation Methods**
1. **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
   - Validate by comparing dynamic traffic data with final routes.
   - Analyze late stops caused by inefficient planned routing.

2. **Inaccurate Delivery Time Estimations:**
   - Time window assignment errors can be analyzed by comparing the planned vs. actual times of deliveries.

3. **Traffic Congestion Impact:**
   - Use GIS-based heatmaps to correlate low-speed events with geolocations or peak traffic patterns.

4. **Customer Location Service Time Variability:**
   - Use process instance filtering to isolate areas/customers with long service durations.

5. **Vehicle Breakdowns:**
   - Analyze patterns of maintenance-related unscheduled stops, and correlate breakdown frequency with mileage and recent activity.

6. **Driver Behavior/Skill Differences:**
   - Compare routes or KPIs by driver ID, isolating patterns of inefficiency caused by navigation errors or slow execution.

7. **Failed Delivery Attempts:**
   - High failed delivery rates likely relate to misaligned time windows or lack of real-time customer notifications.

Utilizing statistical analyses and comparison tools in process mining software validates these root causes.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Route Optimization**
   - *Target:* Reduce travel time and avoid traffic delays.
   - *Root Cause:* Static route planning ignores real-time traffic.
   - *Solution:* Implement dynamic route updates using real-time GPS traffic data. Optimize dispatch routes per shift based on historical and live bottleneck data.
   - *Expected Impact:* Improve On-Time Delivery Rate, reduce fuel consumption.

#### **Strategy 2: Predictive Maintenance**
   - *Target:* Minimize unscheduled breakdowns and reduce maintenance costs.
   - *Root Cause:* Reactive vehicle maintenance policies.
   - *Solution:* Use event log data to detect usage patterns that precede breakdowns (e.g., mileage thresholds, high idle times). Schedule predictive maintenance accordingly.
   - *Expected Impact:* Reduce unscheduled maintenance stops, improve Vehicle Utilization Rate.

#### **Strategy 3: Enhanced Failed Delivery Handling**
   - *Target:* Lower failed delivery rates.
   - *Root Cause:* Customers unavailable during deliveries.
   - *Solution:* Notify customers before delivery via SMS/email to confirm availability or reschedule. Prioritize stops dynamically based on confirmed availability.
   - *Expected Impact:* Reduce failed delivery rates, saving time and fuel on reattempts.

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

#### **5.1 Accounting for Constraints**
   - **Driver Hours:** Incorporate legal and contractually agreed shift durations into route planning.
   - **Vehicle Capacities:** Use dispatch system data for weight and volume constraints during route calculations.
   - **Customer Windows:** Ensure dynamic optimization respects customer-requested time windows.

#### **5.2 Monitoring and Sustainability Plan**
   - Deploy process mining dashboards to track KPIs post-implementation:
     - Delivery punctuality, failed delivery rates, congestion-related delays, maintenance schedules, fuel efficiency.
   - Continuous anomaly detection (e.g., missed time windows, emerging traffic hotspots).
   - Monitor driver-specific performance metrics for targeted improvements.
