Trace clustering is a technique used in process mining to group similar traces (sequences of events) together based on their behavior or characteristics. This can be particularly useful when dealing with heterogeneous process data, where different types of events or activities may have different characteristics or patterns. By clustering similar traces together, it becomes easier to analyze and understand the behavior of the overall process, as well as identify any patterns or trends that may be present. Additionally, trace clustering can also be used to identify any anomalies or outliers within the data, which can help to improve the overall quality and accuracy of the process mining results. Overall, trace clustering is an important tool in the field of process mining that can help to uncover valuable insights and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of various processes.
