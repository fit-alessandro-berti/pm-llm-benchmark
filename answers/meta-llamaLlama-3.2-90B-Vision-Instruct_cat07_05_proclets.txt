The image presents a flowchart illustrating the process of lab testing, with two distinct classes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test." The flowchart is divided into two sections, each representing one of these classes. The "Lab visit" section is located on the left side of the image, while the "Lab test" section is situated on the right.

**Lab Visit Section:**

*   The flowchart begins with a doctor ordering an entry, which triggers the lab assistant to take a blood sample.
*   The lab assistant then receives the result and judges it, leading to either everything being fine or the need for further tests.
*   If further tests are required, the lab assistant sends a report, which is received by the doctor, who then updates the result.
*   This process is repeated until the doctor receives an updated result, at which point the lab assistant sends a final report.

**Lab Test Section:**

*   The flowchart starts with a chemical analyst performing a test, which requires a lab visit.
*   The chemical analyst makes a report, which is received by the lab test, leading to the finish of the lab test.
*   The chemical analyst then performs another test, which again requires a lab visit.
*   The chemical analyst makes another report, which is received by the lab test, resulting in the provision of an updated report.

**Class Diagram:**

*   The class diagram at the bottom of the image shows that the two proclot classes are connected through two channels: "Order system" and "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
*   The "Order system" channel connects the "Lab visit" class to the "Lab test" class, while the "Can you perform a HGB test for John?" channel connects the "Lab test" class to the "Lab visit" class.

Overall, the flowchart illustrates the complex process of lab testing, highlighting the interactions between different classes and the various steps involved in completing a lab test.
