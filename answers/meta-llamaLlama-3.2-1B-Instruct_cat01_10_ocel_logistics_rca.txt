Here are the root causes for the performance issues in the process, focusing on data-specific considerations:

**Object-Centric Event Log**

1. **Unindexed fields**: Many fields, such as `duration` and `objects`, are not indexed properly, leading to slow queries and slow down the event log processing.
2. **Nested queries**: Frequent nested queries, like `SELECT objects.frequency (number of objects) FROM objects WHERE objects.frequency (number of objects) =?`, can lead to slow query performance.
3. **String concatenation**: In some cases, string concatenation is used to construct query parameters or filters, which can lead to performance issues.

**`items` Object Type**

1. **Inefficient sorting**: The `items` object type has a large number of items, and sorting by `items` field is not efficient. It's recommended to use a more efficient indexing strategy, such as a composite index on `items + order`.
2. **High selectivity**: Some `items` events have very low selectivity (e.g., `item out of stock` events), which can lead to slow query performance.

**`employees` Object Type**

1. **Inefficient grouping**: The `employees` object type has a large number of items, and grouping by `items` field is not efficient. It's recommended to use a more efficient indexing strategy, such as a composite index on `employees + role`.
2. **String concatenation**: In some cases, string concatenation is used to construct query parameters or filters, which can lead to performance issues.

**`orders` Object Type**

1. **Inefficient sorting**: The `orders` object type has a large number of items, and sorting by `order` field is not efficient. It's recommended to use a more efficient indexing strategy, such as a composite index on `orders + customer`.
2. **High selectivity**: Some `orders` events have very low selectivity (e.g., `confirm order` events), which can lead to slow query performance.

**`customers` Object Type**

1. **Inefficient grouping**: The `customers` object type has a large number of items, and grouping by `items` field is not efficient. It's recommended to use a more efficient indexing strategy, such as a composite index on `customers + order`.
2. **String concatenation**: In some cases, string concatenation is used to construct query parameters or filters, which can lead to performance issues.

**`products` Object Type**

1. **Inefficient sorting**: The `products` object type has a large number of items, and sorting by `items` field is not efficient. It's recommended to use a more efficient indexing strategy, such as a composite index on `products + category`.
2. **High selectivity**: Some `products` events have very low selectivity (e.g., `create package` events), which can lead to slow query performance.

**`packages` Object Type**

1. **Inefficient grouping**: The `packages` object type has a large number of items, and grouping by `packages` field is not efficient. It's recommended to use a more efficient indexing strategy, such as a composite index on `packages + customer`.
2. **String concatenation**: In some cases, string concatenation is used to construct query parameters or filters, which can lead to performance issues.

To improve performance, consider the following:

1. Optimize indexing strategies for each object type.
2. Use efficient sorting and grouping strategies.
3. Avoid string concatenation and use parameterized queries.
4. Consider using parallel processing or distributed processing for large queries.

Note that these are just a few examples of potential performance issues and root causes, and may require further investigation and analysis to identify the actual cause of the performance issues.
