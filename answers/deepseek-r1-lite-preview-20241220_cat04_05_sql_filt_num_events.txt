To solve this problem, we need to filter out cases with more than six events and return the events from cases that have six or fewer events. Here's how we can achieve this step by step:

1. **Count the number of events per `case_id`:**

   We group the events by `case_id` and count the number of events in each group.

2. **Select `case_id`s with six or fewer events:**

   We use the `HAVING` clause to filter groups where the count is less than or equal to six.

3. **Retrieve all events from these selected `case_id`s:**

   We use a subquery to get the list of qualifying `case_id`s and select all events where the `case_id` is in this list.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    event_log
WHERE
    case_id IN (
        SELECT
            case_id
        FROM
            event_log
        GROUP BY
            case_id
        HAVING
            COUNT(*) <= 6
    );
```

This query selects all events from the `event_log` table where the `case_id` has six or fewer events in total.
