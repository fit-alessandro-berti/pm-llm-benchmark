# Contextual Activity Renaming Analysis

## Step 1: Identifying Recurring Activities and Their Contextual Differences

### `Verify Documents` (appears twice in C001 and C003)
| Case | Occurrence | Context |
|------|-----------|---------|
| C001 | 1st | Initial check of identity documents — incomplete, triggers a call for missing docs |
| C001 | 2nd | Re-check after customer submits the missing ID scan — a verification retry |
| C003 | 1st | Physical ID verification at branch — initial pass |
| C003 | 2nd | Re-verification after an internal account adjustment was made |

**Contextual signal:** Position in the flow and the preceding events clearly indicate the first is a *preliminary* check and the second is a *follow-up re-verification* triggered by an intervening action.

---

### `Call Customer` (appears twice in C002; once each in C001 and C003 but with different purposes)
| Case | Occurrence | Context |
|------|-----------|---------|
| C001 | 1st (only) | Agent calls to request missing documents — a document-chase call |
| C002 | 1st | Outbound call to clarify an account discrepancy — an investigative call |
| C002 | 2nd | Follow-up call to confirm that adjustments were successfully made — a confirmation call |
| C003 | 1st (only) | Officer calls a customer who stepped out to return to the branch — a recall/retrieval call |

**Contextual signal:** The `Additional Context` column and surrounding activities distinguish the *purpose* of each call (document retrieval, discrepancy clarification, adjustment confirmation, or physical return request).

---

## Step 2: Renamed Activity Definitions

| Original Name | New Name | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `Verify Documents` (1st occurrence) | `Initial Document Verification` | First-pass check; may be incomplete |
| `Verify Documents` (2nd occurrence) | `Re-verify Documents` | Repeated after an intervening corrective action |
| `Call Customer` (C001) | `Request Missing Documents (Call)` | Call purpose is to obtain absent documentation |
| `Call Customer` (C002, 1st) | `Clarify Account Discrepancy (Call)` | Call purpose is investigative — resolving a discrepancy |
| `Call Customer` (C002, 2nd) | `Confirm Account Adjustments (Call)` | Follow-up to verify corrections were received/accepted |
| `Call Customer` (C003) | `Recall Customer to Branch (Call)` | Customer physically left; call is to bring them back |

> **Non-recurring activities** (`Initiate Request`, `Submit Additional`, `Adjust Account`, `Approve Request`) appear only once per case with consistent meaning and are **left unchanged**.

## Step 4: Justification of Naming Choices

### `Initial Document Verification` vs. `Re-verify Documents`
- **Position-based clue:** The first `Verify Documents` always occurs early in the flow, immediately after the request is initiated. The second always follows an intervening corrective event — either a document submission (C001) or an account adjustment (C003).
- **Contextual clue:** The `Additional Context` in the second occurrence explicitly uses language like *"re-checks"* and *"re-verify"*, confirming the remedial, iterative nature of the activity.
- **Naming logic:** `Initial` signals a first-pass attempt; `Re-verify` signals a deliberate repetition after a gap, making the loop structure of the process immediately visible.

---

### `Request Missing Documents (Call)`
- **Contextual clue:** *"Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs"* — the call is purely a document-retrieval action, not a discussion or confirmation.
- **Naming logic:** Embedding the purpose ("Request Missing Documents") and the channel ("Call") makes the activity self-documenting and distinguishable from other outbound calls.

---

### `Clarify Account Discrepancy (Call)`
- **Contextual clue:** *"Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy"* — the call is investigative in nature, aimed at understanding a problem before any fix is applied.
- **Naming logic:** Placing this *before* `Adjust Account` in the log confirms it is a diagnostic step; the name reflects the investigative intent.

---

### `Confirm Account Adjustments (Call)`
- **Contextual clue:** *"Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made"* — the call occurs *after* `Adjust Account`, serving as a verification/sign-off step with the customer.
- **Naming logic:** The word "Confirm" and its position after the adjustment activity signal closure of the correction loop, as opposed to initiating an investigation.

---

### `Recall Customer to Branch (Call)`
- **Contextual clue:** *"Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return"* — uniquely, this call is not about data or account issues; it is a logistical retrieval action specific to the physical branch context.
- **Naming logic:** "Recall" captures the intent to bring someone back; "to Branch" anchors it in the physical service channel, distinguishing it from all other call types in the log.
