The updated DECLARE model includes new constraints to mitigate bias in the loan application process. Here's the enhanced dictionary and a brief explanation of the added constraints:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "ManualReview": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # New constraint 4
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # New constraint 2
    },
    "precedence": {
        "ManualReview": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # New constraint 3
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # New constraint 1
    },
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### **Explanation of Added Constraints:**
1. **`nonsuccession: CheckApplicantRace  Reject`**  
   *Purpose:* Prevents direct transitions from checking sensitive attributes (e.g., race) to rejection decisions.  
   *Impact:* Ensures decisions influenced by protected attributes cannot occur immediately after their verification, forcing intermediate steps (e.g., manual review).

2. **`response: CheckApplicantRace  ManualReview`**  
   *Purpose:* Mandates a mandatory review (e.g., `ManualReview`) after any sensitive attribute check.  
   *Impact:* Reduces bias by requiring human oversight before decisions based on sensitive data.

3. **`precedence: ManualReview  Reject`**  
   *Purpose:* Ensures rejections only occur *after* a manual review.  
   *Impact:* Guarantees that decisions relying on protected attributes are scrutinized and not automated.

4. **`coexistence: ManualReview  Reject`**  
   *Purpose:* Requires `ManualReview` and `Reject` to appear in the same trace.  
   *Impact:* Validates that every rejection undergoes a review, preventing covert biased decisions.

### **Bias Mitigation Strategy**  
These constraints enforce a "check  review  decision" workflow for sensitive attributes, ensuring no decision can bypass human oversight. By blocking direct paths to bias (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace  Reject`) and requiring documentation (`ManualReview`), the model minimizes the risk of discriminatory outcomes while maintaining process flexibility.
