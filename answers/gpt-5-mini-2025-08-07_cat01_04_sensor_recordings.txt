Summary (grouping + labels)
- Events 1–3, 13–15: Idle / Standby
- Events 4–6: Cutting / High-material-removal machining
- Events 7–8: Clamping / Secondary machining or fastening (transition/finish step)
- Event 9: Welding / high-energy joining (spot or arc)
- Events 10–12: Cooldown, part transfer and quality check / light adjustment

Rationale and how readings map to each label

1) Idle / Standby — Events 1–3 and 13–15
- Sensor signature: Temperature 20–21 °C, Pressure 1 bar, Vibration 0–0–5 Hz, Material flow 0, Tool position 0, Low energy (0.4–0.5 kWh).
- Why: Baseline low temperature, no material flow and minimal vibration indicate the machine is powered but inactive (standby). The repeated baseline at the end (13–15) indicates the cycle returns to idle.

2) Cutting / High-material-removal machining — Events 4–6
- Sensor signature: Temperature jumps to 50–58 °C, Vibration high (30–38 Hz), Material flow = 5 units/s, Tool position moves from 510 mm, Energy rises to 2.03.0 kWh, pressure slightly up (11.5 bar).
- Why: The combination of (a) a clear temperature rise, (b) large vibration levels, (c) steady material feed (flow = 5) and (d) active tool motion indicates an aggressive material-removal operation such as cutting, milling or turning. Energy consumption and vibration are typical of cutting loads; material flow shows continuous feed of stock.

3) Clamping / Secondary machining or Fastening (transition/finish) — Events 7–8
- Sensor signature: Temperature falls to ~40 °C, Pressure up to 2 bar, Vibration drops to ~10 Hz, Material flow reduced to 2 units/s, Tool position ~15 mm, energy 2.0 kWh.
- Why: Pressure increase suggests a clamping or press engagement (holding the part for a subsequent operation). Reduced flow and lower vibration indicate lighter work than the heavy cutting step — possibly finishing passes, drilling, fastening, or repositioning the part for the next operation. I label this as a secondary/finishing/clamping stage.

4) Welding / High-energy joining — Event 9
- Sensor signature: Temperature spikes to 80 °C, Vibration spikes to 50 Hz, Energy spikes to 5.0 kWh, Material flow = 0, Pressure remains ~2 bar, Tool position static at 15 mm.
- Why: A strong, short-lived spike in temperature and energy with very high vibration and no material feed suggests a high-energy joining operation—e.g., spot or arc welding—rather than cutting (which had material flow). Tool position holding steady while energy and temperature explode is consistent with a stationary welding/join cycle. I label this Welding / high-energy joining.

5) Cooldown, Part Transfer & Quality Check / Light Adjustment — Events 10–12
- Sensor signature: Temperature drops to 3025 °C, Vibration falls to 1–5 Hz, Material flow 01 units/s, Tool position moves to 20 mm, Energy lowers to ~1–1.6 kWh.
- Why: After the welding spike, the machine returns to lower-energy activity. Low vibration and low temp indicate cooldown. Small material flow and a slight tool reposition suggest part transfer, minor adjustments or inspection operations (e.g., sensors, vision check, or moving the part to an output position). These are consistent with a post-process quality check / transfer step.

Notes on ambiguity and confidence
- High confidence: Events 1–3 and 13–15 are idle; events 4–6 are a high-energy cutting-like operation; event 9 is a clear high-energy joining or similar process.
- Moderate confidence: Events 7–8 are interpreted as clamping/secondary machining or fastening—pressure rise supports clamping but the exact operation (drill, press, fasten) cannot be uniquely identified from these sensors alone.
- Moderate confidence: Events 10–12 likely represent cooldown and inspection/transfer; could also be light finishing rather than inspection.

If you want, I can:
- Produce a simple state sequence timeline (event  labeled state).
- Suggest thresholds to automatically detect these phases in a larger log.
