# High-Level Process Step Identification and Justification

Based on the provided event log, I have analyzed the sequence of low-level activities across multiple cases (A1, B2) to identify coherent, logically connected phases of the manufacturing process. The events follow a consistent temporal and functional pattern, allowing for robust grouping into higher-level process steps.

##  Proposed High-Level Activities

| High-Level Step | Included Low-Level Events | Rationale for Grouping |
|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **1. Material Preparation** | <ul><li>Retrieve raw metal sheet</li><li>Scan barcode</li><li>Place metal sheet on table</li><li>Align metal sheet</li><li>Preheat metal sheet</li></ul> | These events represent the initial stage where raw material is received, identified, positioned, and prepared for processing. They occur in sequence and are all prerequisites to the actual fabrication. The activities are temporally clustered, performed by operators or automated systems, and logically dependent on one another (e.g., you cannot weld without first placing and aligning the sheet). Preheating is a necessary condition for welding in metal fabrication. This step ensures the material is ready for joining. |
| **2. Welding Assembly** | <ul><li>Pick up welding tool</li><li>Weld corner A</li><li>Weld corner B</li></ul> | This step involves the actual mechanical joining of the metal components. The activities are sequential, performed by the same operator (Operator B), and directly result in the structural formation of the part. "Weld corner A" and "corner B" indicate a full joint closure. The tool pickup is a precursor to welding, and all welding actions are part of a single assembly operation. This is a core fabrication step and distinct from preparation or quality checks. |
| **3. Quality Inspection (Weld Integrity)** | <ul><li>Measure weld integrity</li></ul> | This step evaluates the structural soundness of the weld after assembly. It occurs immediately after welding and involves a dedicated sensor (Quality Sensor #1). The integrity score (e.g., 95, 93) confirms whether the weld meets technical standards. This is a mandatory verification step before proceeding to coating. It is isolated in time and function from the previous steps and serves as a quality gate. |
| **4. Protective Coating Application** | <ul><li>Apply protective coating</li></ul> | This step adds a surface layer (polyurethane) to protect the welded part from corrosion and environmental degradation. It is a standard post-weld treatment and occurs after quality inspection. The coating is applied by a dedicated unit (Coating Unit #3), indicating a specialized process. This is a uniform, repeatable action across all cases. |
| **5. Coating Drying** | <ul><li>Dry coating</li></ul> | This is the post-coating step where the applied coating is cured or dried using heat (Heating Unit #2). It must occur after coating application to ensure proper adhesion and performance. Drying is a necessary physical transformation step that completes the surface treatment phase. |
| **6. Final Visual Inspection** | <ul><li>Visual check</li></ul> | This is a final, human-performed quality check conducted at the end of the process. It confirms that the part appears intact, free of defects, and matches expected visual standards. While less quantitative than the weld integrity measurement, it provides a final assurance of product appearance and safety. It is performed by a different operator (Operator C), reinforcing its role as a post-process validation. |

##  Key Grouping Principles Applied

1. **Temporal Proximity & Sequence**  
   Events occur in a strict chronological order within each case. For example, preparation  welding  inspection  coating  drying  final check. This sequential flow justifies grouping events that occur in a chain of causality.

2. **Functional Coherence**  
   Events that serve a common purpose (e.g., material handling, welding, inspection) are grouped together. For instance, all "welding" actions are logically part of assembly, regardless of tool or corner.

3. **Resource and System Consistency**  
   - Operators (A, B, C) perform distinct roles: A handles material, B performs welding, C conducts final checks.  
   - Machines (Heating Units, Coating Unit, Quality Sensor) are used in specific phases.  
   This functional specialization supports grouping by process stage.

4. **Logical Dependencies**  
   - Preheating must precede welding.  
   - Welding must precede weld integrity measurement.  
   - Coating must follow quality inspection.  
   - Drying follows coating.  
   - Final visual check is the last step.  
   These dependencies validate the separation of steps.

5. **Repetition Across Cases**  
   All steps occur in the same order across Case A1 and Case B2, confirming they represent a consistent production flow.

##  Summary of High-Level Process Flow

The manufacturing process unfolds as follows:

1. **Material Preparation**  (Material received, identified, positioned, preheated)  
2. **Welding Assembly**  (Structural joining of metal parts)  
3. **Quality Inspection (Weld Integrity)**  (Verification of weld strength)  
4. **Protective Coating Application**  (Surface protection)  
5. **Coating Drying**  (Curing of coating)  
6. **Final Visual Inspection**  (Human confirmation of product quality)

This structure provides a clear, auditable, and scalable representation of the manufacturing workflow — ideal for process mapping, root cause analysis, or process optimization.

##  Notes on Naming

- **"Material Preparation"** instead of "Raw Material Handling": Emphasizes readiness for use, not just movement.
- **"Welding Assembly"** instead of "Welding": Highlights that it's an assembly operation, not just a single act.
- **"Quality Inspection (Weld Integrity)"**: Specificity ensures clarity about what is being measured.
- **"Protective Coating Application"** and **"Coating Drying"**: Clearly distinguish between application and curing.
- **"Final Visual Inspection"**: Distinguishes it from technical measurements and emphasizes human oversight.
