Process cubes, introduced by Wil van der Aalst and his colleagues, play a crucial role in multi-dimensional process mining, an extension of traditional process mining that considers multiple perspectives or dimensions simultaneously. Here's how process cubes differ from traditional process mining approaches:

1. **Multi-Dimensional Perspective**: Traditional process mining focuses on a single perspective, such as the control flow (what are the steps and their order), data (attributes associated with events), or organizational structure (who performs which tasks). In contrast, process cubes consider multiple dimensions simultaneously. These dimensions could be control flow, data, time, resources, etc.

2. **Cubes vs Flats**: Traditional process mining approaches often result in flat representations like process trees, workflow nets, or Petri nets. Process cubes, inspired by data warehousing and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) techniques, are hierarchical, multi-dimensional structures that allow for easier navigation and aggregation of information.

3. **Aggregation Levels**: Process cubes allow for aggregation at different levels along each dimension. For example, in the control flow dimension, one can aggregate at the level of individual tasks, groups of tasks, or entire processes. This enables analysts to zoom in and out of the process model, providing a more comprehensive understanding.

4. **Cross-Fertilization**: Process cubes facilitate cross-fertilization between different dimensions. For instance, one might want to analyze how data attributes influence control flow, or how resource allocation affects performance metrics. Traditional approaches often treat these aspects separately, while process cubes integrate them.

5. **Visualization and Navigation**: Process cubes provide a more intuitive way to visualize and navigate complex processes. They enable analysts to drill down into specific areas of interest, filter out irrelevant details, and focus on the most important aspects.

Here's how process cubes are constructed:

- Each dimension is represented as a hierarchy with aggregation levels.
- The control flow dimension is typically at the core of the cube, with other dimensions arranged around it.
- Data points (events) populate the cube, with each event's coordinates determined by its values along each dimension.
- Analysts can then navigate and analyze the process cube using various techniques like slicing, dicing, rolling up/drilling down, etc.

In summary, while traditional process mining approaches focus on a single perspective and result in flat representations, process cubes consider multiple dimensions simultaneously and provide hierarchical, navigable structures for analyzing complex processes. This makes them particularly useful when dealing with large, intricate processes involving many aspects.
