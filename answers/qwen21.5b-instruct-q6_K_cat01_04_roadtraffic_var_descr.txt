This is a data record that describes actions performed by a fine payer towards an offender:

The first row, for example:
```sql
Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Payment ( frequency = 58  performance = 8662344.828 )
```

Indicates the creation of a fine and the payment is made, with the frequency being per month and the performance being 1978071800.000.

The second row:
```sql
Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment ( frequency = 56  performance = 20088000.000 )
```

Indicates that an add penalty has been added, after sending fine notification, and the payment is made.

The third row:
```sql
Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment ( frequency = 45  performance = 61676160.000 )
```

Indicates that an add penalty has been added after sending fine notification, and the payment is made.

And so on for each row until the last one:
```sql
Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment ( frequency = 42  performance = 28246628.571 )
```

Indicates that an add penalty has been added after sending fine notification, and the payment is made.

So this data describes actions taken by a fine payer towards an offender regarding fines and penalties, including creating/finalizing fines, adding penalties, payments, etc., with performance indicators indicating how many times the actions were performed in relation to a total of 100% performance.
