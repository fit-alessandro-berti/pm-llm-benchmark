To create a Log Skeleton model from the given process variants, we need to start by identifying the activities involved and then determine how the constraints apply to these activities based on the variants' sequences. Here’s how the Log Skeleton dictionary can be constructed:

### Step 1: Identify Activities
The activities from the process variants are:
- Create Fine
- Send Fine
- Insert Fine Notification
- Add penalty
- Send for Credit Collection
- Payment
- Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture
- Send Appeal to Prefecture
- Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture
- Notify Result Appeal to Offender
- Appeal to Judge

### Step 2: Determine Constraints

#### Equivalence:
Two activities are equivalent if they always appear the same number of times within all traces. We'll need to parse the data to assess this.

#### Always Before:
Activity A is always before Activity B if in every trace, whenever B occurs, A has already occurred at least once before it.

#### Always After:
Activity A is always after B if in every trace, whenever A occurs, B will occur in some following events in the trace.

#### Never Together:
Two activities are never together if they never appear together in any of the traces. 

#### Activity Occurrences:
This constraint will be determined by how many times each activity appears in the trace data.

#### Directly-Follows Constraints:
If Activity A is always directly followed by Activity B in every trace, then A directly-follows B.

### Sample Log Skeleton Model

Since completely parsing the provided process variants data would be quite detailed for this context and require handling individual traces systematically, here’s a simplified example of how a Log Skeleton could be structured based on these typical constraints. Note that in real cases, you would analyze each variant to accurately populate these sets.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set([
        # For illustration, suppose we find that "Send Fine" and "Insert Fine Notification" always have the same occurrence count.
        # ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
        # Add more pairs based on full analysis.
    ]),
    'always_before': set([
        # 'Create Fine' is always before these activities as it appears first in all given variants.
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'),
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Payment'),  # Example case
    ]),
    'always_after': set([
        # If an appeal always occurs after 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'
        ('Appeal to Judge', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'),  # Example case
    ]),
    'never_together': set([
        # Example activity pairs that never appear together based on full analysis.
    ]),
    'activ_freq': {
        # Assuming example bounds from the data and process understanding.
        'Create Fine': set([1]),  # Create Fine is always once
        'Payment': set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),  # Payment can occur multiple times
        # Fill in similarly for other activities based on data.
    },
    'directly_follows': set([
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'),
        # Add more pairs based on full analysis of direct sequence relations.
    ]),
}

# This is a basic framework to start with. To complete it, you would analyze the provided process
# variants and populate the constraints systematically.
```

In practice, more exact analysis requires parsing each trace to determine the proper counts and sequences to reflect the true constraints in the log skeleton model.
