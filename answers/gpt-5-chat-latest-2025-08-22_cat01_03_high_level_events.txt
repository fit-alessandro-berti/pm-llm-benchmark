Got it! Let’s carefully map the detailed event logs into **higher-level manufacturing process stages** so the workflow is easier to understand. I will:  
1. Identify natural clusters of events.  
2. Explain the rationale.  
3. Provide clear names for the aggregated process steps.

# **Proposed High-Level Process Steps**

### **1. Material Preparation**
**Low-Level Events (Case A1 & B2):**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet (Operator A)  
- Scan barcode (Operator A)  
- Place metal sheet on table (Operator A)  
- Align metal sheet (Robot Arm #2)  
- Preheat metal sheet (Heating Unit #1)  

**Rationale:**  
These steps all occur before any joining or assembly begins. They involve preparing the raw component, ensuring correct identification (barcode scan), placing it for processing, aligning, and heating it to the required working temperature. These tasks are consistent with the **"setup/initial preparation"** phase.

**High-Level Step Name:**  
 **Material Preparation & Setup**

---

### **2. Welding / Assembly**
**Low-Level Events:**  
- Pick up welding tool (Operator B)  
- Weld corner A (Operator B)  
- Weld corner B (Operator B)  

**Rationale:**  
This group involves handling tools specifically for creating the welded product structure. Picking up the tool and executing welding operations are consecutive and task-specific, clearly representing a **structural assembly phase**.

**High-Level Step Name:**  
 **Structural Welding / Assembly**

---

### **3. In-Process Quality Check**
**Low-Level Event:**  
- Measure weld integrity (Quality Sensor #1)  

**Rationale:**  
This event evaluates the success of the welding activity before continuing. Since it's a distinct validation activity focused on **weld quality**, it is separated into its own step.

**High-Level Step Name:**  
 **Weld Integrity Inspection**

---

### **4. Surface Treatment**
**Low-Level Events:**  
- Apply protective coating (Coating Unit #3)  
- Dry coating (Heating Unit #2)  

**Rationale:**  
Both events relate to **surface protection** after welding. Applying and drying the coating are logically coupled and represent one stage: adding durability and quality to the product’s exterior.

**High-Level Step Name:**  
 **Protective Coating Application**

---

### **5. Final Quality Inspection**
**Low-Level Event:**  
- Visual check (Operator C)  

**Rationale:**  
Final human verification ensures the product passes inspection after all technical steps. It is distinct from in-process automated checks since it provides a conclusive **“go/no-go” inspection** before moving the product forward.  

**High-Level Step Name:**  
 **Final Visual Quality Inspection**

---

# **Full Structured Representation**

For each **CaseID (product instance)**, the low-level activities can be aggregated as:

```
Case A1:
1. Material Preparation & Setup
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place on table
   - Align
   - Preheat
2. Structural Welding / Assembly
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B
3. Weld Integrity Inspection
   - Measure weld integrity
4. Protective Coating Application
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating
5. Final Visual Quality Inspection
   - Visual check


Case B2: (same pattern as Case A1)
1. Material Preparation & Setup
2. Structural Welding / Assembly
3. Weld Integrity Inspection
4. Protective Coating Application
5. Final Visual Quality Inspection
```

---

# **Summary of High-Level Activities**
 **Material Preparation & Setup**  
 **Structural Welding / Assembly**  
 **Weld Integrity Inspection**  
 **Protective Coating Application**  
 **Final Visual Quality Inspection**

 This abstraction shows how we go from dozens of granular events (barcode scans, alignments, sensor readings) to **5 meaningful process stages**, making it much easier to analyze efficiency, delays, and quality issues.

Would you like me to also propose a **generic process model diagram (like a BPMN-style flow)** based on these stages that you can apply across all cases in the full event log?
