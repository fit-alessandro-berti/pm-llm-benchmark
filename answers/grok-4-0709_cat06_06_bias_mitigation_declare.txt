### Explanation of Added Constraints and Bias Reduction
To mitigate potential bias in the loan application process (e.g., decisions influenced by sensitive attributes like race, gender, or age), I introduced two new activities: `CheckSensitiveAttributes` (representing any check of sensitive applicant data) and `ManualReview` (representing a mandatory human oversight step to ensure fairness). The following constraints were added:

1. **Response(CheckSensitiveAttributes, ManualReview)**: If sensitive attributes are checked, a manual review must follow later in the trace. This ensures that any potential bias introduced by checking sensitive data is addressed through human review before proceeding.
   
2. **ChainPrecedence(ManualReview, FinalDecision)**: Every occurrence of `FinalDecision` must be immediately preceded by `ManualReview`. This enforces that all final decisions (e.g., approve or reject) are directly made after a manual review, providing an opportunity to detect and correct biased outcomes.

3. **NonChainSuccession(CheckSensitiveAttributes, FinalDecision)**: It is forbidden for `FinalDecision` to immediately follow `CheckSensitiveAttributes`. This prevents rushed or direct biased decisions right after accessing sensitive data, forcing at least one intervening step (e.g., the manual review).

These constraints collectively reduce bias by mandating oversight and preventing direct paths from sensitive data checks to decisions, promoting fairness without altering the core process flow.
