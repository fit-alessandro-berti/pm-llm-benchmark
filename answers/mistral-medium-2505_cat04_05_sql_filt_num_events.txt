# DuckDB SQL Query to Filter Cases with Six or Fewer Events

Here's a DuckDB SQL query that filters out cases with more than six events and returns only events from cases with six or fewer events:

```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)

SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    case_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
WHERE
    c.event_count <= 6
ORDER BY
    e.case_id,
    e.timestamp;
```

## Explanation:

1. First, we create a CTE (Common Table Expression) called `case_counts` that:
   - Groups the event log by `case_id`
   - Counts the number of events for each case

2. Then we join this back to the original `event_log` table to:
   - Keep only events from cases where the count is  6
   - Return all columns from the original event log for these cases

3. The results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for better readability.

Alternative version using a subquery in the WHERE clause:

```sql
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
WHERE
    e.case_id IN (
        SELECT
            case_id
        FROM
            event_log
        GROUP BY
            case_id
        HAVING
            COUNT(*) <= 6
    )
ORDER BY
    e.case_id,
    e.timestamp;
```

Both queries will produce the same result, filtering out cases with more than six events.
