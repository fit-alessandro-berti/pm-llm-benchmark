**Comprehensive Approach to Analyze Speedy Parcels' Operations and Recommend Improvements**

### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

#### **Data Preprocessing and Integration:**

*   **Challenges:**
    *   Handling different timestamp formats and time zones across sources.
    *   Resolving inconsistencies in vehicle, driver, or package IDs.
    *   Managing varying event frequencies (e.g., GPS updates vs. scanner events).
*   **Integration Steps:**
    1.  **Unify Timestamps:** Standardize all timestamps to a single format (e.g., UTC) for coherent analysis.
    2.  **Harmonize IDs:** Ensure consistent naming conventions for vehicles, drivers, and packages across all logs.
    3.  **Merge Event Logs:** Combine data into a single, cohesive event log, utilizing the Case ID (Vehicle-Day) for correlation.
    4.  **Filter and Cleanse:** Remove irrelevant events, handle missing values, and correct obvious data entry errors.

#### **Process Discovery:**

*   **Algorithm Selection:** Utilize the Inductive Miner or a similar algorithm suitable for discovering complex, real-world processes.
*   **Actual Process Visualization:** Map the end-to-end delivery process, highlighting:
    *   Depot departure and arrival.
    *   Delivery attempts (successes and failures).
    *   Travel segments, including low-speed detections (potential traffic jams).
    *   Unscheduled stops (e.g., due to vehicle issues).
*   **Example (Simplified):**
    *   **Start Shift**  **Depart Depot**  (**Travel**  **Arrive Customer**  **[Delivery Success|Delivery Failed]**)*  **Return to Depot**  **End Shift**

#### **Conformance Checking Against Planned Routes:**

*   **Comparison Technique:** Align the discovered process model with planned routes from the dispatch system, focusing on:
    *   **Sequence Deviations:** Unplanned stops or activities.
    *   **Timing Differences:** Significant discrepancies between planned and actual times for deliveries or travel segments.
    *   **Unplanned Stops:** Maintenance stops or unexpected delays not accounted for in the planned route.
*   **Identifying Deviations:**
    *   **Visual Inspection:** Utilize conformance checking visualizations to highlight discrepancies.
    *   **Metrics Analysis:** Calculate and compare key metrics (e.g., planned vs. actual delivery times, number of stops) to quantify deviations.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

*   **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR):** Percentage of deliveries made within the agreed-upon time window.
*   **Average Time per Delivery Stop (ATDS):** Mean time spent at each delivery location.
*   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio (TTSTR):** Comparison of time spent traveling versus time spent on delivery services.
*   **Fuel Consumption per km/package (FCPK):** Efficiency metric combining fuel usage, distance, and package volume.
*   **Vehicle Utilization Rate (VUR):** Percentage of operational time vehicles are in use.
*   **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays (FTD):** Quantification of delays attributed to traffic.
*   **Rate of Failed Deliveries (RFD):** Percentage of delivery attempts that were unsuccessful.

#### **Calculating KPIs from the Event Log:**

*   **OTDR:** Calculate successful deliveries within time windows / total delivery attempts.
*   **ATDS:** Average time difference between 'Arrive Customer' and 'Depart Customer' events.
*   **TTSTR:** Sum of travel segments' durations / sum of service time at stops.
*   **FCPK:** Utilize GPS data to estimate fuel consumption, correlated with package data and distance traveled.
*   **VUR:** Aggregate vehicle operational time / total available time.
*   **FTD:** Analyze 'Low Speed Detected' events for frequency and duration.
*   **RFD:** Calculate failed delivery attempts / total attempts.

#### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**

*   **Bottleneck Analysis:** Focus on KPIs indicating inefficiencies (e.g., high ATDS, frequent FTD).
*   **Process Mining Techniques:**
    *   **Variant Analysis:** Compare processes of high vs. low performers (drivers, routes).
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Examine relationships between traffic patterns and delays.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

#### **Potential Root Causes:**

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Static routes not accounting for real-time traffic.
*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:** Planned routes underestimate actual travel times.
*   **Traffic Congestion Patterns:** Consistent traffic at specific times/routes.
*   **Service Time Variability:** Unforeseen delays at customer locations.
*   **Vehicle Breakdowns:** Frequent unscheduled stops for maintenance.
*   **Driver Behavior/Skill Differences:** Variability in driver performance impacting delivery times.
*   **Failed Delivery Attempts:** Requiring re-delivery, increasing overall travel and service time.

#### **Validation through Specific Process Mining Analyses:**

*   **Variant Analysis:** Compare travel times and delivery success rates across different routes/drivers to pinpoint suboptimal planning or skill differences.
*   **Traffic Data Correlation:** Analyze 'Low Speed Detected' events against external traffic data to confirm congestion patterns.
*   **Dwell Time Analysis:** Examine time spent at customer locations to understand service time variability.
*   **Maintenance Stop Analysis:** Study the frequency and timing of unscheduled vehicle stops.
*   **Failed Delivery Attempt Analysis:** Investigate the causes and impacts of failed deliveries.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments**

*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Suboptimal route planning due to static routes.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Failure to account for real-time traffic conditions.
*   **Proposal:**
    *   Implement a dynamic routing system that adjusts routes based on current traffic data and process mining insights.
*   **Expected Impact:**
    *   **OTDR Increase:** 10-15%
    *   **TTSTR Reduction:** 8-12%
    *   **FCPK Improvement:** 5-8%

#### **Strategy 2: Optimized Delivery Territories**

*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Inefficient service time distribution across territories.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Poor allocation of delivery stops to drivers based on historical data.
*   **Proposal:**
    *   Utilize process mining to redefine delivery territories based on actual service times, reducing overall travel distances.
*   **Expected Impact:**
    *   **ATDS Reduction:** 12-18%
    *   **VUR Increase:** 8-12%
    *   **FCPK Improvement:** 8-10%

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**

*   **Targeted Inefficiency:** Unscheduled vehicle stops due to maintenance issues.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Lack of proactive maintenance scheduling.
*   **Proposal:**
    *   Develop predictive models using vehicle usage patterns from the event log to schedule timely maintenance.
*   **Expected Impact:**
    *   **Unscheduled Stop Reduction:** 15-20%
    *   **VUR Increase:** 5-8%
    *   **FCPK Improvement:** 3-5% (due to better-maintained vehicles)

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

#### **Accounting for Operational Constraints:**

*   **Driver Working Hours:** Ensure optimization strategies comply with labor regulations.
*   **Vehicle Capacities:** Adjust routing and delivery assignments to maximize vehicle capacity without overloading.
*   **Customer Time Windows:** Prioritize deliveries to meet agreed-upon time windows, negotiating adjustments when necessary.

#### **Continuous Monitoring Plan:**

*   **Key Metrics and Process Views:**
    *   Track the KPIs mentioned earlier (OTDR, ATDS, TTSTR, etc.) in real-time.
    *   Monitor process model adherence and deviations.
*   **Process Mining Dashboard:**
    *   Visualize current operational performance.
    *   Highlight emerging issues or deviations from expected outcomes.
*   **Regular Review Cadence:**
    *   Schedule monthly reviews to assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies.
    *   Identify new bottlenecks or inefficiencies that may have arisen.
