### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive (R) to Approve (P):**
   - **Average Time:** ~25 hours (90,000 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (3,600 seconds)
   - **Issue:** The standard deviation is suspiciously low, suggesting a rigid, possibly artificial schedule for approvals. This may indicate automated or batch processing rather than a natural workflow.

2. **Approve (P) to Notify (N):**
   - **Average Time:** 7 days (604,800 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation:** 2 days (172,800 seconds)
   - **Issue:** The long average delay with high variability suggests inconsistent notification practices, possibly due to backlogs, resource constraints, or manual intervention.

3. **Assign (A) to Close (C):**
   - **Average Time:** 2 hours (7,200 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (3,600 seconds)
   - **Issue:** Claims are closed quickly after assignment, often without intermediate steps like evaluation or approval. This may indicate premature closures or skipped steps.

4. **Evaluate (E) to Notify (N):**
   - **Average Time:** 5 minutes (300 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute (60 seconds)
   - **Issue:** The extremely short time between evaluation and notification suggests a rushed or automated process, possibly skipping required checks.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve) – Low STDEV:**
   - **Hypothesis 1:** Approvals are processed in batches at fixed intervals (e.g., daily or hourly), leading to a rigid schedule.
   - **Hypothesis 2:** A system error or misconfiguration causes approvals to be marked prematurely, bypassing proper evaluation.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify) – Long Delay:**
   - **Hypothesis 1:** Notification is handled by a separate team with a backlog, causing delays.
   - **Hypothesis 2:** Some claims require additional manual review before notification, introducing variability.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close) – Premature Closure:**
   - **Hypothesis 1:** Adjusters are closing claims without proper evaluation due to workload pressure.
   - **Hypothesis 2:** Certain claim types (e.g., low-value claims) are auto-closed after assignment.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify) – Too Quick:**
   - **Hypothesis 1:** Notification is automated and triggered immediately after evaluation, skipping manual review.
   - **Hypothesis 2:** Some evaluations are superficial, leading to rapid notifications without thorough checks.

### Verification SQL Queries

1. **Identify Claims with Suspiciously Fast Approvals (R to P):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.claim_id,
       ce1.timestamp AS receive_time,
       ce2.timestamp AS approve_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
   FROM
       claims c
   JOIN
       claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R'
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   WHERE
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 90000 - 3*3600  -- Below 24 hours (mean - 3*STDEV)
       OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 90000 + 3*3600; -- Above 27 hours (mean + 3*STDEV)
   ```

2. **Check Claims with Long Approve-to-Notify Delays (P to N):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.claim_id,
       ce1.timestamp AS approve_time,
       ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
   FROM
       claims c
   JOIN
       claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'P'
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 604800 + 3*172800  -- Above 13 days (mean + 3*STDEV)
       OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 604800 - 3*172800; -- Below 1 day (mean - 3*STDEV)
   ```

3. **Find Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment (A to C):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.claim_id,
       ce1.timestamp AS assign_time,
       ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
   FROM
       claims c
   JOIN
       claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A'
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C'
   WHERE
       NOT EXISTS (
           SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce3
           WHERE ce3.claim_id = c.claim_id
           AND ce3.activity IN ('E', 'P')
           AND ce3.timestamp BETWEEN ce1.timestamp AND ce2.timestamp
       )
       AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 7200 + 3*3600; -- Below 3 hours (mean + 3*STDEV)
   ```

4. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters or Claim Types:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce1.resource AS adjuster_id,
       c.claim_type,
       COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
   FROM
       claims c
   JOIN
       claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A'
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C'
   WHERE
       NOT EXISTS (
           SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce3
           WHERE ce3.claim_id = c.claim_id
           AND ce3.activity IN ('E', 'P')
           AND ce3.timestamp BETWEEN ce1.timestamp AND ce2.timestamp
       )
       AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 7200 + 3*3600
   GROUP BY
       ce1.resource, c.claim_type
   ORDER BY
       anomaly_count DESC;
   ```

These queries will help identify specific claims and patterns contributing to the anomalies, allowing for further investigation into root causes.
