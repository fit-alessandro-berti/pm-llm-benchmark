To identify potential unfair differences in the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group, we need to analyze the process variants and their associated execution times. Here are some key differences that may indicate disparity:

### 1. **Outcome Differences:**
   - **Loan Denied:**
     - **Protected Group:**
       - `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied (frequency = 26, performance = 390055.423)`. This is a lengthy and complex process.
     - **Unprotected Group:**
       - `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied (frequency = 23, performance = 440003.565)`. This seems similar to the protected group's variant but with a slightly higher frequency.
       - `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement (frequency = 40, performance = 390033.075)`.

   - **Sign Loan Agreement:**
     - **Protected Group:**
       - `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement (frequency = 13, performance = 349945.923)`.
     - **Unprotected Group:**
       - `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement (frequency = 4, performance = 440103.800)`.
       - `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement (frequency = 1, performance = 439937.000)`.

### 2. **Additional Steps:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Variants that include multiple `Make Visit to Assess Colatteral` and `Request Co-Signer On Loan` steps often lead to longer processes and higher execution times.
     - For example, the variant with `Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral` takes significantly more time (390055.423 ms) compared to simpler processes.
   
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - While they also have these additional steps, there is often a mix of shorter and longer paths. For instance, paths that do not include these additional visits or co-signer requests tend to be quicker, like `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement (frequency = 1656, performance = 340004.889)`.

### 3. **Frequency Differences:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Frequencies like `Appointment Denied (frequency = 599, performance = 90000.623)` and `Application Rejected (frequency = 960, performance = 219999.156)` are relatively high, indicating a more complex initial rejection process.
   
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Frequncies such as `Application Rejected (frequency = 664, performance = 260002.042)` and `Appointment Denied (frequency = 363, performance = 80001.088)` are also high, but the presence of `Submit File to Underwriter` and `Sign Loan Agreement` at higher frequencies (1656 and 188) for those who are not denied suggest that the processing of applications without co-signers or additional visits is quicker.

### Conclusion:
The main differences lie in the complexity of the process:
- **Protected Group:** 
  - Tends to have more complex and longer paths involving several `Make Visit to Assess Colatteral` and `Request Co-Signer On Loan` steps, which leads to higher execution times and longer processes, often culminating in loan rejection.
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - While they too have complex paths, those leading to loan denial are frequent, but not necessarily with the many additional steps seen in the protected group's paths. The unprotected group often completes the simplified path to `Sign Loan Agreement`.

These differences suggest that the protected group faces higher hurdles and prolonged processes before their applications are ultimately rejected, indicating a potential disparity in how their applications are handled compared to the unprotected group.
