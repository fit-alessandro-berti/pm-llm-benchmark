## Transformation Logic Explanation

**Case Identification:**
I identified three main cases in this log:
1. Case 1: Working with the Quarterly_Report.docx document
2. Case 2: A multi-activity workflow involving Document1.docx, email, PDF review, and final edits
3. Case 3: Editing the Budget_2024.xlsx spreadsheet

The cases were determined based on application switches and workflow continuity. The Document1.docx activity was grouped as a single case despite switching to other applications because the work resumed on this document after completing other tasks.

**Activity Naming:**
I standardized the activity names by:
- Removing low-level actions like "FOCUS" or "TYPING" and instead interpreting their business meaning
- Creating consistent verbs like "Edit", "Draft", "Review", "Update"
- Using object names from the "Window" field to make activities meaningful
- Merging sequential typing events into a single activity when they were part of the same task

**Timestamps:**
I used the original timestamps without modification, as they already appear to be in a standardized format suitable for process analysis.

**Narrative:**
This event log tells the story of a user working on three main tasks during a morning work session:
1. Editing the Quarterly Report document (Case 1)
2. A complex workflow involving drafting a document, checking email, reviewing a PDF, updating a spreadsheet, and incorporating changes into the document (Case 2)
3. Editing a budget spreadsheet (Case 3)

The transformation creates a clear, analyst-friendly view of the user's work processes by abstracting away technical details and focusing on meaningful business activities.
