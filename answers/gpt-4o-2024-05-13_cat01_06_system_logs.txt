Based on the provided system log, we need to transform it into a process mining event log suitable for standard process mining tools. This transformation involves identifying process instances (cases), defining meaningful activity names, and maintaining appropriate attributes for analysis.

**Event Log Transformation:**

Here is the structured event log with the required attributes:

| Case ID  | Activity Name               | Timestamp                 | App             | Window                   |

**Explanation:**

1. **Case Identification:**
   - **Documents:** Each document (Word, Excel, PDF) constitutes a distinct case. Actions performed within the same document are grouped into the same case (e.g., editing, saving). For example, "Document1.docx" sessions are grouped under `C2`.
   - **Emails:** Handling an email or a sequence of emails forms a single case (`C3`). This includes actions within the email client, such as reading, replying, and sending.
   - **PDFs:** Working on a PDF file like "Report_Draft.pdf" forms a unique case (`C4`).
   - **Spreadsheets:** Editing sessions of a spreadsheet like "Budget_2024.xlsx" are grouped under another specific case (`C5`).

2. **Activity Naming:**
   - We've condensed multiple low-level actions into higher-level, standardized process activities. For example:
     - "FOCUS" actions leading to document interactions are named "Open Document."
     - Consecutive "TYPING" actions are simply "Typing."
     - "SAVE" actions are named "Save Document" or "Save Spreadsheet" based on context.
     - "SWITCH" actions involving moving to another application or client work contextually tagged (e.g., "Switch to Email").
     - Application-specific actions, like opening and sending emails, are termed more meaningfully (e.g., "Open Email," "Send Email").

3. **Event Attributes:**
   - **Case ID:** Unique identifier to group events corresponding to a specific user task.
   - **Activity Name:** Captures the essence of the interaction.
   - **Timestamp:** Preserves the original occurrence time of each event.
   - **Additional attributes:** Includes application name and window title for clarity.

This structured event log is now suitable for import and analysis in standard process mining tools, ensuring meaningful analysis and understanding of user behavior and workflow.
