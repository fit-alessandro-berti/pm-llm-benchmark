Here's the Python dictionary representing the **Log Skeleton** for the complex order fulfillment process described in the scenario:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order')  # QC and PO always occur the same number of times (as one depends on the other)
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),  # CA must occur before RI
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),          # RI must occur before PI
        ('Quality Check', 'Generate Shipping Label')  # QC must occur before GSL
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),          # PI must occur before QC
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),  # GSL must occur before D
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')    # IC must occur before RP
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('Pack Order', 'Quality Check'),    # PO and QC cannot co-exist in the same case (already ordered)
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items')     # RI and PI cannot happen together without availability confirmation
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'Receive Order': {1},               # RO occurs exactly 1 time
        'Check Availability': {1, 2},       # CA occurs 1 or 2 times
        'Reserve Items': {0, 1},            # RI occurs 0 or 1 time
        'Pick Items': {1, 2},               # PI occurs 1 or 2 times
        'Quality Check': {1},               # QC occurs exactly 1 time
        'Pack Order': {1},                  # PO occurs exactly 1 time
        'Generate Shipping Label': {1},     # GSL occurs exactly 1 time
        'Dispatch': {1},                    # D occurs exactly 1 time
        'Invoice Customer': {0, 1},         # IC occurs 0 or 1 time
        'Record Payment': {0, 1}            # RP occurs 0 or 1 time
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),   # RO is directly followed by CA
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),   # CA is directly followed by RI
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),           # PI is directly followed by QC
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),           # QC is directly followed by PO
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),   # GSL is directly followed by D
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')     # IC is directly followed by RP
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Equivalence**: Some activities (like "Quality Check" and "Pack Order") always occur together and have the same occurrences.
- **Always Before**: Some activities must happen before others (e.g., "Check Availability" must happen before "Reserve Items").
- **Always After**: Some activities must happen after others (e.g., "Generate Shipping Label" must happen after "Dispatch").
- **Never Together**: Some activities cannot co-exist in the same case (e.g., "Pack Order" and "Quality Check" cannot both happen).
- **Activity Occurrences**: The frequency of each activity in a case (e.g., "Receive Order" occurs exactly once, while "Check Availability" could occur once or twice).
- **Directly-Follows Constraints**: Some activities are immediately followed by others (e.g., "Receive Order" is directly followed by "Check Availability").
