Key places bias shows up

- Scoring stage: A fixed +10 “Community” uplift is added for applicants affiliated with “Highland Civic Darts Club.” This is explicit differential treatment not tied (here) to demonstrated credit risk.
- Decision stage: Approvals around the borderline score range depend on that uplift (and appear to correlate with being a local resident), yielding different effective thresholds across groups.
- Process/controls: Manual review records no risk-based rationale for different outcomes in similar score bands; the rules engine then operationalizes the adjusted score, so any biased uplift directly drives the final decision.

Who is favored and how

- Community affiliation: Members of the Highland Civic Darts Club receive +10 points. In this sample, that uplift was outcome-determinative at least once (C004), moving a 690 applicant to 700 and to approval, while a non-member with a higher score (C003, 715) was rejected.
- Local residency (indirectly): While there’s no explicit “local” uplift logged, approvals in the 700–720 band favored locals. All locals were approved (3/3), whereas non-locals were approved 1/2 overall, and 0/1 in the 700–720 band.

Evidence from the cases

- Community uplift effect:
  - C004: 690 +10 (Community) = 700  Approved.
  - C003: 715 +0 (Non-local, no community)  Rejected.
- Acceptance rates:
  - Local residents: 3/3 approved (100%).
  - Non-locals: 1/2 approved (50%).
  - Community members: 2/2 approved (100%).
  - Non-members: 2/3 approved (66.7%).
  Note: small sample, but the pattern suggests a higher effective bar for non-members and non-locals.
- Borderline band (700–720):
  - With community/local ties: approved (C001 at 720 after uplift; C004 at 700 after uplift).
  - Without ties: rejected (C003 at 715).

Why this matters for fairness and equity

- Disparate treatment: Awarding points for a specific community membership is a group-based preference unrelated (as shown here) to creditworthiness. It functions as a proxy for locality and possibly other demographic factors, advantaging those with certain social ties.
- Disparate impact: Applicants lacking local/community affiliations face a higher effective threshold despite similar underlying scores, disadvantaging newcomers, commuters, or people outside specific networks.
- Inconsistency and opacity: Manual review didn’t document risk-based reasons for approving a 700 but rejecting a 715, undermining explainability and trust.

What to change

- Remove or justify the community uplift:
  - Either eliminate membership-based points, or demonstrate (with outcome data) that such affiliation predicts materially lower risk.
  - If any “community” factor is retained, generalize it to objective, widely accessible signals (e.g., verified participation in accredited financial education, on-time payment history with recognized partners), not a single named club.
- Enforce consistent thresholds:
  - Define and apply one documented approval cutoff (or a risk-based pricing continuum) that does not vary by locality or affiliation.
- Blind and constrain manual review:
  - Hide LocalResident and CommunityGroup fields from underwriters unless demonstrably necessary.
  - Require reviewers to record specific, risk-based reasons linked to policy.
- Audit for fairness routinely:
  - Track selection rates by LocalResident and CommunityGroup; apply the 80% rule and counterfactual tests (toggle community/local flags holding other features constant to see if outcomes change).
  - Validate feature importance and calibration; remove/penalize proxy-like features with high disparity and low predictive value.
- Provide alternatives for those without affiliations:
  - Offer pathways to earn equivalent credit (e.g., income/documentation checks, alternative data) so similarly creditworthy applicants aren’t penalized for lacking local ties.

Bottom line: The explicit +10 for a specific community affiliation, combined with patterns favoring locals in the 700–720 band, creates unequal effective thresholds. That design risks unfairly rejecting applicants with comparable creditworthiness who are non-local or unaffiliated.
