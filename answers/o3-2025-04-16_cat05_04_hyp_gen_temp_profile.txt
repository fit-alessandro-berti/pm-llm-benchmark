Anomalies observed in the temporal profile

1. Receive  Approve (R  P)  
   • Avg  25 h, stdev = 1 h  dispersion far tighter than the rest of the process.  
   • Suggests an artificial, fixed-interval job or a hard SLA timer.

2. Approve  Notify (P  N)  
   • Avg = 7 days, stdev = 2 days  much slower and far more erratic than any other step.  
   • Indicates backlog, manual batching, or dependency on an external channel (postal letters, 3-rd-party payment confirmation).

3. Assign  Close (A  C)  
   • Avg = 2 h, yet Evaluate/Approve are supposed to occur in-between.  
   • Implies premature closure, duplicate claims merged, or misuse of the Close code as “reject”.

4. Evaluate  Notify (E  N)  
   • Avg = 5 min, stdev = 1 min  too quick for human-driven activities.  
   • Points to auto-generated notifications or skipped approval.

5. Evaluate  Close (E  C)  
   • Avg = 1 h with a very large stdev (50 min) relative to the mean.  
   • Some claims are closed immediately after evaluation, others linger—possible triage vs. complex claims split.

Hypotheses for the irregularities

H-1  (R  P) An overnight batch program changes claim status to “approved” once per day; hence almost identical delays.  
H-2  (P  N) Notification depends on a separate customer-communication subsystem that is frequently back-logged or off-line on weekends.  
H-3  (A  C) Certain low-value or duplicate claims are closed by an adjuster without evaluation; rule may exist but is applied inconsistently.  
H-4  (E  N) An automatic email is sent when an evaluation form is saved—regardless of whether approval is finished.  
H-5  Variation by adjuster, region or claim_type (e.g., auto vs. home) causes different timing patterns that inflate some averages.

SQL-based checks

(Intervals shown in seconds; adjust thresholds as needed.)

1. Identify claims with suspiciously constant R  P delay (±2 h band around 25 h).

```sql
WITH times AS (
  SELECT
      claim_id,
      MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS r_ts,
      MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_ts - r_ts)) AS sec_r_to_p
FROM times
WHERE p_ts IS NOT NULL
  AND ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_ts - r_ts)) - 90000) < 7200;    -- 90 000 s ± 2 h
```

2. Approve  Notify taking longer than 3 days or shorter than 4 h.

```sql
WITH times AS (
  SELECT
      claim_id,
      MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_ts,
      MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS n_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       p_ts, n_ts,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - p_ts))/3600 AS hours_delay
FROM times
WHERE n_ts IS NOT NULL
  AND (n_ts - p_ts) NOT BETWEEN INTERVAL '4 hours' AND INTERVAL '3 days';
```

3. Claims closed within 3 h of assignment and missing evaluation or approval.

```sql
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS a_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS c_ts,
         BOOL_OR(activity = 'E') AS has_eval,
         BOOL_OR(activity = 'P') AS has_approve
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id, a_ts, c_ts,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_ts - a_ts))/3600 AS hours_a_to_c
FROM steps
WHERE c_ts IS NOT NULL
  AND (c_ts - a_ts) <= INTERVAL '3 hours'
  AND (NOT has_eval OR NOT has_approve);
```

4. Evaluate  Notify happening in under 2 minutes.

```sql
WITH times AS (
  SELECT
      claim_id,
      MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS e_ts,
      MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS n_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - e_ts)) AS sec_e_to_n
FROM times
WHERE n_ts IS NOT NULL
  AND (n_ts - e_ts) < INTERVAL '2 minutes';
```

5. Correlate long P  N delays with adjusters or claim_type.

```sql
WITH deltas AS (
  SELECT ce1.claim_id,
         c.claim_type,
         a.adjuster_id,
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))/86400 AS days_p_to_n
  FROM claim_events p
  JOIN claim_events n ON n.claim_id = p.claim_id
  JOIN claims c        ON c.claim_id = p.claim_id
  JOIN adjusters a     ON a.name = ANY (ARRAY[ p.resource, n.resource ])
  WHERE p.activity = 'P'
    AND n.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT adjuster_id,
       claim_type,
       COUNT(*)                       AS cnt,
       AVG(days_p_to_n)               AS avg_days,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY days_p_to_n) AS p90_days
FROM deltas
GROUP BY adjuster_id, claim_type
ORDER BY p90_days DESC;
```

6. Distribution of R  P intervals to confirm the “batch” hypothesis.

```sql
SELECT
    date_trunc('hour', p.timestamp) AS hour_bucket,
    COUNT(*)                        AS approvals_this_hour
FROM claim_events r
JOIN claim_events p ON p.claim_id = r.claim_id
WHERE r.activity = 'R' AND p.activity = 'P'
GROUP BY hour_bucket
ORDER BY hour_bucket;
```

Interpreting results  
• High concentration of approvals in the same daily hour band supports H-1.  
• P  N delays clustered around weekends or specific adjusters support H-2/H-5.  
• Frequent A  C < 3 h without E/P events confirms H-3.  
• Consistently sub-2-minute E  N gaps validate H-4 (automatic e-mail).

These queries should isolate the cases, actors and conditions driving each temporal irregularity and help decide whether they originate from legitimate business rules or process breakdowns.
