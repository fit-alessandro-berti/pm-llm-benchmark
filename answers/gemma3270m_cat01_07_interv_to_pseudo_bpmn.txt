Okay, I understand. I will generate the BPMN-like textual process model based on the interview excerpts you provided. I will focus on capturing the key aspects of the process, the flow, and the roles and participants involved. I will strive for clarity and logical coherence, even if the interview data is incomplete or inconsistent. I will also acknowledge any ambiguities and provide a clear explanation of the model's intent.

I'm ready to begin! Give me the interview excerpts.
