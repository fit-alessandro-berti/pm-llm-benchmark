To infer the case groupings from the provided sequence of hospital process events, we need to look at the attributes such as `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and the `department` where the activities occur. Each patient's journey through the hospital can be considered a separate case. Here's how we can group the events into separate cases:

### Case 1:
- **Patient Age:** 45
- **Patient Gender:** M
- **Department:** ER, Radiology, Surgery

Events:
1. `Register patient` (ER)
4. `Initial triage` (ER)
7. `X-ray imaging` (Radiology)
12. `Doctor consultation` (ER)
15. `Patient discharged` (ER)
17. `Recovery room` (Surgery)

### Case 2:
- **Patient Age:** 62
- **Patient Gender:** F
- **Department:** ER, Laboratory

Events:
2. `Register patient` (ER)
5. `Initial triage` (ER)
8. `Lab test requested` (ER)
10. `Lab test completed` (Laboratory)
11. `Doctor consultation` (ER)
16. `Patient discharged` (ER)

### Case 3:
- **Patient Age:** 28
- **Patient Gender:** M
- **Department:** Surgery

Events:
3. `Register patient` (Surgery)
6. `Doctor consultation` (Surgery)
9. `Surgery preparation` (Surgery)
13. `Surgery performed` (Surgery)
14. `Patient discharged` (Surgery)

By grouping the events based on the patient attributes and the sequence of activities, we can infer the separate cases from the interleaved sequence.
