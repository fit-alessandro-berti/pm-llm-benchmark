Here are the cases where the logged sequence departs from the standard ProcuretoPay flow—and why each is a concern:

1. Case 1002  
   • Outoforder steps:  
     – “Issue Purchase Order” (08:40) happens before “Approve Purchase Requisition” (next day at 08:00).  
     – “Release Payment” (0203 07:15) happens before goods are received (0204), before the invoice is matched (0205), and even before the PR is approved.  
   • Why it’s problematic:  
     – Bypassing approval removes a key authorization control, opening the door to unauthorized/duplicate spending.  
     – Paying before goods receipt and threeway match (PO, GR, invoice) risks overpayment, fraud, or paying for items never delivered.  

2. Case 1003  
   • Outoforder steps:  
     – “Release Payment” on 0208 happens before the invoice is even received (0209) and before goods receipt (0210) and matching (0211).  
   • Why it’s problematic:  
     – Prepaying creates cashflow risk and weakens audit trails (no invoice to substantiate payment).  
     – If goods are returned or the invoice is disputed, reversing a payment already made is cumbersome.  

3. Case 1004  
   • Outoforder steps:  
     – “Receive Goods” on 0206 at 09:00 precedes “Issue Purchase Order” at 09:15.  
   • Why it’s problematic:  
     – Receiving without a PO means there was no formal commitment or price negotiated in advance—risking nonstandard terms, pricing disputes, or unauthorized offcontract purchases.  
     – It undermines inventory accuracy and makes threeway matching impossible.  

4. Case 1001  
   • Follows the textbook sequence (PR  approval  PO  GR  invoice  match  payment  close).  
   • Represents the controlcompliant ideal.  

Summary of Risks Across These Anomalies:  
• Control bypass (approvals after or even after payment)  
• Payments made without valid supporting documents (invoice, GR)  
• Receiving goods without a PO exposes the organization to unapproved or offcontract spend  
• Breakdowns in the threeway match process increase likelihood of duplicate payments, overpayments, or fraud.
