Below is a case-by-case breakdown of the sequences that deviate from the textbook Procure-to-Pay flow (PR approval  PO issuance  goods receipt  invoice receipt  3-way match  payment) and why each is problematic:

1. Case 1002  
   • “Issue Purchase Order” (08:40) occurs before “Approve Purchase Requisition” (next day 08:00).  
     – Control failure: POs should only be issued against an approved requisition to ensure spending is authorized.  
   • “Vendor Invoice Received” (02-03 07:00) and “Release Payment” (07:15) both precede the PR approval and the goods receipt (02-04 09:00) and the invoice-to-PO match (02-05 08:00).  
     – Violates the 3-way match control: you’re paying invoices for goods you’ve neither formally received nor matched to a PO.  
     – Risk of paying for goods never ordered, duplicate or fictitious invoices, and lack of audit trail.

2. Case 1003  
   • “Release Payment” on 02-08 precedes “Vendor Invoice Received” (02-09), “Receive Goods” (02-10) and even the invoice-to-PO match (02-11).  
     – You cannot match invoice, PO and receipt before payment if payment goes out first.  
     – High risk of overpayment, fraud or paying for goods/services never delivered or invoiced.

3. Case 1004  
   • “Receive Goods” (02-06 09:00) occurs a full 15 minutes before “Issue Purchase Order” (02-06 09:15).  
     – Material arriving without a PO means there is no contractual basis or approved spending authorization on file.  
     – Inventory and financial records may be out of sync, and you lose the built-in control that ties receipts back to an approved PO.

4. Case 1001  
   • Follows the standard sequence with no obvious anomalies.

Why these deviations matter  
– Authorization risk: POs or payments before requisition approval open the door to unauthorized or fraudulent spending.  
– Three-way match breakdown: Paying before you have both a goods receipt and a valid invoice matched to a PO defeats one of the primary internal controls in P2P.  
– Audit and compliance: Out-of-order steps make post-facto reconciliation far more difficult and can trigger findings in an internal or external audit.  
– Financial accuracy: You may overstate liabilities or expenses (if you pay too early) or accrue goods you never ordered.
