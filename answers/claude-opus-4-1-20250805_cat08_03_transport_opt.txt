# Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: A Comprehensive Optimization Approach

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration

The integration of multi-source data into a cohesive event log requires careful preprocessing:

**Data Integration Strategy:**
- **Primary Case ID Definition**: Establish "Vehicle-Day" (e.g., V12-20241205) as the primary case identifier, with secondary case IDs for package-level analysis
- **Event Harmonization**: Map events from different sources to a unified activity taxonomy:
  - GPS events  Movement activities (Start_Travel, Stop_Travel, Idle_Traffic, etc.)
  - Scanner events  Service activities (Arrive_Customer, Complete_Delivery, Failed_Attempt)
  - Dispatch events  Planning activities (Route_Assigned, Route_Modified)
  - Maintenance events  Disruption activities (Unscheduled_Maintenance, Scheduled_Service)

**Key Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Temporal Granularity Mismatch**: GPS data arrives every 30 seconds while scanner events are sporadic
  - Solution: Apply time-window aggregation and event correlation algorithms
- **Location Data Reconciliation**: GPS coordinates vs. customer addresses
  - Solution: Implement geofencing with 50-meter radius around delivery addresses
- **Missing Data Handling**: Scanner events without corresponding GPS data
  - Solution: Use interpolation and probabilistic event matching based on temporal proximity

**Data Quality Framework:**
```
Event Log Quality Checks:
 Completeness: Verify all vehicles have start/end shift events
 Consistency: Validate package scans match dispatch manifests
 Accuracy: Cross-reference GPS speeds with location changes
 Timeliness: Flag events with suspicious timestamps (future dates, duplicates)
```

### Process Discovery Implementation

**Discovery Approach:**
1. **Multi-perspective Mining**: Apply Inductive Miner or Split Miner algorithms to discover:
   - Control flow perspective (sequence of delivery activities)
   - Resource perspective (driver/vehicle patterns)
   - Temporal perspective (time between activities)

2. **Hierarchical Process Models**: Create three levels of abstraction:
   - **Level 1 (Strategic)**: Depot  Route Execution  Return
   - **Level 2 (Tactical)**: Include major deviations (maintenance, route modifications)
   - **Level 3 (Operational)**: Detailed stop-by-stop activities including parking, walking, customer interaction

3. **Variant Analysis Focus Areas**:
   - Happy path: Direct depot-to-customer-to-depot flows
   - Exception paths: Failed deliveries, maintenance interruptions
   - Inefficiency patterns: Excessive idle time, route backtracking

### Conformance Checking Methodology

**Alignment Analysis Framework:**

1. **Token Replay Analysis**: Compare discovered models against planned routes to identify:
   - **Sequence Deviations**: Actual delivery order vs. planned sequence
     - Metric: Edit distance between planned and actual stop sequences
   - **Timing Deviations**: Actual vs. planned arrival times
     - Metric: Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of arrival times
   - **Scope Deviations**: Unplanned stops or skipped deliveries
     - Metric: Percentage of non-conforming activities

2. **Deviation Categories to Monitor:**
   ```
   Critical Deviations:
    Route Abandonment (>20% planned stops not attempted)
    Excessive Detours (>15% additional distance traveled)
    Time Window Violations (delivery outside customer availability)
    Unauthorized Stops (>10 minutes at non-customer locations)
   
   Minor Deviations:
    Stop Resequencing (<5 stops out of order)
    Brief Delays (<15 minutes cumulative)
    Minor Route Adjustments (alternative streets, same destination)
   ```

3. **Conformance Scoring**: Develop a composite conformance score:
   - Fitness (0-1): How well the log fits the planned model
   - Precision (0-1): How precisely the model represents the log
   - Generalization (0-1): Model's ability to handle variations

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators Definition

**Primary KPIs for Speedy Parcels:**

1. **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR)**
   - Calculation: `(Deliveries within time window / Total delivery attempts) × 100`
   - Target: >95%
   - Event log extraction: Compare scanner "Delivery Success" timestamp with dispatch time windows

2. **Average Service Time per Stop (ASTS)**

5. **First-Time Delivery Success Rate (FTDSR)**
   - Calculation: `Successful first attempts / Total unique packages`
   - Target: >90%
   - Critical for cost reduction (avoiding re-delivery)

6. **Vehicle Productive Utilization (VPU)**
   - Calculation: `(Driving time + Service time) / Total shift time`
   - Target: >80%
   - Identifies excessive idle time or inefficient depot operations

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques

**1. Temporal Bottleneck Analysis:**

  - X-axis: Time of day
  - Y-axis: Vehicle/Driver
  - Color coding: Activity types
  - Identify clustering of delays at specific times (rush hours, lunch breaks)

**2. Spatial Bottleneck Mapping:**
- **Heat Map Generation**: Overlay GPS idle events on city maps
  - Red zones: Frequent delays (>10 minutes idle)
  - Yellow zones: Moderate delays (5-10 minutes)
  - Green zones: Smooth flow (<5 minutes delays)

**3. Resource Performance Mining:**
- **Comparative Performance Matrices**:
  ```
  Driver Performance Quadrant:
  High Speed, High Success  High Speed, Low Success
                            
  Low Speed, High Success  Low Speed, Low Success
  ```
  - Identify top/bottom performers for targeted interventions

**4. Activity Duration Analysis:**
- **Box plots** for each activity type across different contexts:
  - Service time by: neighborhood density, package size, time of day
  - Travel time by: route segment, traffic conditions, vehicle type
  - Outlier detection: Activities taking >2 standard deviations from mean

**Bottleneck Impact Quantification:**
- **Process Simulation**: Model removal of identified bottlenecks
- **What-if Analysis**: Calculate potential time/cost savings
- **Criticality Index**: `(Frequency of bottleneck × Average delay × Downstream impact)`
