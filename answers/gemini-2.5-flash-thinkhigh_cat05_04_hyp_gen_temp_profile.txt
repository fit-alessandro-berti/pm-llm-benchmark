Here are the identified anomalies, hypotheses, and proposed SQL verification methods based on the provided temporal profile.

### Identified Anomalies and Hypotheses

**1. Anomaly: R to P (Receive to Approve)**
*   **Profile:** Average time of 90,000 seconds (~25 hours) with a very low standard deviation of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).
*   **Observation:** A relatively long average duration with unusually tight consistency. This rigidity suggests that human variability in processing is largely absent, or bypassed.
*   **Hypotheses:**
    *   **Scheduled Batch Processing:** Approvals might occur in fixed, regular batches (e.g., once per day at a specific time), causing claims to wait until the next batch run, regardless of when they were received.
    *   **Automated or Fixed-Delay Approval:** Certain types of claims (e.g., low-value, straightforward) might undergo an automated approval process that triggers after a fixed delay, or human approval is highly standardized with strict deadlines.
    *   **Systemic Dependency:** The 'P' step might depend on a system process or external data feed that updates exactly once per day, introducing a fixed waiting period.

**2. Anomaly: P to N (Approve to Notify)**
*   **Profile:** Extremely long average time of 604,800 seconds (7 days) with a high standard deviation of 172,800 seconds (2 days).
*   **Observation:** A significant delay between approving a claim and notifying the customer, coupled with high variability. This points to a major bottleneck or inconsistency in the post-approval stage.
*   **Hypotheses:**
    *   **Resource Bottleneck:** The team or system responsible for notifications is severely overloaded, understaffed, or has lower priority compared to other tasks, leading to backlogs.
    *   **External Dependencies:** Notification might be contingent on external confirmations (e.g., payment transfer completion, legal review, document generation) that introduce substantial and unpredictable delays.
    *   **Manual Batching:** Notifications are not sent immediately but are manually batched and sent out periodically (e.g., weekly), with variations depending on volume and staff availability.

**3. Anomaly: A to C (Assign to Close)**
*   **Profile:** Relatively quick average time of 7,200 seconds (2 hours) with a standard deviation of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).
*   **Observation:** This short duration is unusual given that the intended process flow includes 'E' (Evaluate) and 'P' (Approve) between 'A' and 'C'. It suggests that many claims are closed prematurely or without undergoing the full evaluation and approval steps.
*   **Hypotheses:**
    *   **Immediate Rejection/Withdrawal:** Many claims are quickly identified as invalid, duplicates, or are withdrawn by the customer shortly after assignment, leading to rapid closure without further processing.
    *   **Fast-Track for Simple Claims:** Very straightforward or low-value claims are fast-tracked and closed by the adjuster without requiring formal 'E' or 'P' steps.
    *   **Process Misinterpretation:** The 'C' event is sometimes used to indicate a temporary hold or transfer, rather than a final closure.

**4. Anomaly: E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**
*   **Profile:** Very short average time of 300 seconds (5 minutes) with a standard deviation of 60 seconds (1 minute).
*   **Observation:** An extremely rapid transition from 'Evaluate' to 'Notify'. While efficiency is good, this speed might indicate the 'P' (Approve) step is being skipped, implicitly combined, or is itself an automated process.
*   **Hypotheses:**
    *   **Automated Notification:** Once evaluation is marked complete, customer notification is an immediate, automatically triggered system event with no human intervention or additional review.
    *   **Combined Steps:** The 'Evaluate' step implicitly includes 'Approve', or the approval is a perfunctory check that adds no significant time, effectively merging 'E' and 'P' into a single rapid sequence followed by notification.
    *   **Partial Evaluation:** The 'E' event might denote an initial, quick assessment that immediately leads to notification for certain claim outcomes (e.g., immediate denial).

### Proposed Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

The following queries use the `claim_events` table joined with itself to calculate durations between specific activities for each claim. They leverage `LATERAL JOIN` to efficiently find the *next* occurrence of a target activity after a source activity for the same claim.

**Common CTE pattern for calculating duration between two activities (e.g., A and B):**
```sql
WITH ActivityDurations AS (
    SELECT
        t1.claim_id,
        t1.timestamp AS activity1_timestamp,
        t2.timestamp AS activity2_timestamp,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM
        claim_events t1
    JOIN LATERAL (
        SELECT timestamp, resource -- Include resource if needed for analysis
        FROM claim_events
        WHERE claim_id = t1.claim_id
        AND activity = 'ACTIVITY2_CODE'
        AND timestamp > t1.timestamp
        ORDER BY timestamp
        LIMIT 1
    ) AS t2 ON TRUE
    WHERE t1.activity = 'ACTIVITY1_CODE'
)
-- Use ActivityDurations CTE in subsequent queries
```

**Verification Queries for Anomaly 1: R to P (Receive to Approve)**

1.  **Identify claims with R to P duration significantly outside the expected narrow range:**
    *   Check for durations that deviate by more than 3 standard deviations (3 * 3600 seconds = 10800 seconds) from the average (90000 seconds).
    ```sql
    WITH R_P_Durations AS (
        SELECT
            t1.claim_id,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
        FROM
            claim_events t1
        JOIN LATERAL (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = t1.claim_id AND activity = 'P' AND timestamp > t1.timestamp ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 1) AS t2 ON TRUE
        WHERE t1.activity = 'R'
    )
    SELECT
        rpd.claim_id,
        (rpd.duration_seconds / 3600)::NUMERIC(10, 2) AS duration_hours
    FROM
        R_P_Durations rpd
    WHERE
        rpd.duration_seconds < 90000 - 10800 -- Less than 22 hours
        OR rpd.duration_seconds > 90000 + 10800; -- More than 28 hours
    ```

2.  **Correlate R to P duration consistency with claim type or adjuster specialization:**
    *   This helps determine if the rigid timing is specific to certain claim categories or how certain adjusters operate.
    ```sql
    WITH R_P_Durations AS (
        SELECT
            t1.claim_id,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
        FROM
            claim_events t1
        JOIN LATERAL (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = t1.claim_id AND activity = 'P' AND timestamp > t1.timestamp ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 1) AS t2 ON TRUE
        WHERE t1.activity = 'R'
    )
    SELECT
        c.claim_type,
        AVG(rpd.duration_seconds) AS avg_duration_seconds,
        STDDEV_POP(rpd.duration_seconds) AS stdev_duration_seconds,
        COUNT(rpd.claim_id) AS num_claims
    FROM
        R_P_Durations rpd
    JOIN
        claims c ON rpd.claim_id = c.claim_id
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_type
    ORDER BY
        stdev_duration_seconds ASC; -- Order by STDEV to find most rigid types
    ```

**Verification Queries for Anomaly 2: P to N (Approve to Notify)**

1.  **Identify claims with P to N duration as extremely long or surprisingly short:**
    *   Focus on outliers that are much longer or shorter than the 7-day average, indicating severe bottlenecks or rare rapid notifications.
    ```sql
    WITH P_N_Durations AS (
        SELECT
            t1.claim_id,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
        FROM
            claim_events t1
        JOIN LATERAL (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = t1.claim_id AND activity = 'N' AND timestamp > t1.timestamp ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 1) AS t2 ON TRUE
        WHERE t1.activity = 'P'
    )
    SELECT
        pnd.claim_id,
        (pnd.duration_seconds / 86400)::NUMERIC(10, 2) AS duration_days
    FROM
        P_N_Durations pnd
    WHERE
        pnd.duration_seconds > 604800 + (3 * 172800) -- More than 7 days + 6 days = 13 days
        OR pnd.duration_seconds < 604800 - (3 * 172800); -- Less than 7 days - 6 days = 1 day
    ```

2.  **Analyze P to N duration by the `resource` performing the 'Notify' activity:**
    *   This can pinpoint specific individuals, teams, or automated systems that are bottlenecks or exceptions.
    ```sql
    WITH P_N_Durations AS (
        SELECT
            t1.claim_id,
            t2.resource AS notify_resource,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
        FROM
            claim_events t1
        JOIN LATERAL (SELECT timestamp, resource FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = t1.claim_id AND activity = 'N' AND timestamp > t1.timestamp ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 1) AS t2 ON TRUE
        WHERE t1.activity = 'P'
    )
    SELECT
        pnd.notify_resource,
        AVG(pnd.duration_seconds / 86400) AS avg_duration_days,
        STDDEV_POP(pnd.duration_seconds / 86400) AS stdev_duration_days,
        COUNT(pnd.claim_id) AS num_claims
    FROM
        P_N_Durations pnd
    GROUP BY
        pnd.notify_resource
    ORDER BY
        avg_duration_days DESC;
    ```

**Verification Queries for Anomaly 3: A to C (Assign to Close)**

1.  **Find claims with rapid A to C transitions where 'E' or 'P' events are missing between them:**
    *   This directly checks if claims are skipping intended steps.
    ```sql
    SELECT
        t1.claim_id,
        (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) / 3600)::NUMERIC(10, 2) AS duration_hours
    FROM
        claim_events t1 -- 'A' event
    JOIN LATERAL (
        SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = t1.claim_id AND activity = 'C' AND timestamp > t1.timestamp ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 1
    ) AS t2 ON TRUE -- Corresponding 'C' event
    WHERE t1.activity = 'A'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) < 10800 -- Less than 3 hours
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce_mid
        WHERE ce_mid.claim_id = t1.claim_id
        AND ce_mid.timestamp > t1.timestamp
        AND ce_mid.timestamp < t2.timestamp
        AND ce_mid.activity IN ('E', 'P') -- Check if 'E' or 'P' occurred in between
    );
    ```

2.  **Correlate these quick A to C closures with `claim_type` or `adjuster_id`:**
    *   Determine if specific claim types are frequently rejected/withdrawn, or if certain adjusters handle these types.
    ```sql
    WITH Quick_A_C_Skipping_EP AS (
        SELECT
            t1.claim_id,
            t1.resource AS assign_resource -- Assuming resource is adjuster_id for 'A'
        FROM
            claim_events t1 -- 'A' event
        JOIN LATERAL (
            SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = t1.claim_id AND activity = 'C' AND timestamp > t1.timestamp ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 1
        ) AS t2 ON TRUE
        WHERE t1.activity = 'A'
        AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) < 10800
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce_mid
            WHERE ce_mid.claim_id = t1.claim_id AND ce_mid.timestamp > t1.timestamp AND ce_mid.timestamp < t2.timestamp AND ce_mid.activity IN ('E', 'P')
        )
    )
    SELECT
        c.claim_type,
        COALESCE(a.name, 'Unknown Adjuster') AS adjuster_name, -- In case resource isn't always an adjuster_id
        COUNT(qac.claim_id) AS num_quick_closed_claims
    FROM
        Quick_A_C_Skipping_EP qac
    JOIN
        claims c ON qac.claim_id = c.claim_id
    LEFT JOIN
        adjusters a ON qac.assign_resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR -- Cast adjuster_id to VARCHAR for comparison
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_type, adjuster_name
    ORDER BY
        num_quick_closed_claims DESC;
    ```

**Verification Queries for Anomaly 4: E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**

1.  **Find claims where E to N is very short and a 'P' event did not occur between them:**
    *   This verifies if the 'Approve' step is indeed being bypassed or combined.
    ```sql
    SELECT
        t1.claim_id,
        (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)))::NUMERIC(10, 2) AS duration_seconds
    FROM
        claim_events t1 -- 'E' event
    JOIN LATERAL (
        SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = t1.claim_id AND activity = 'N' AND timestamp > t1.timestamp ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 1
    ) AS t2 ON TRUE -- Corresponding 'N' event
    WHERE t1.activity = 'E'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) < 60 -- Less than 1 minute
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce_mid
        WHERE ce_mid.claim_id = t1.claim_id
        AND ce_mid.timestamp > t1.timestamp
        AND ce_mid.timestamp < t2.timestamp
        AND ce_mid.activity = 'P' -- Check if 'P' occurred in between
    );
    ```

2.  **Group by the `resource` performing 'E' and 'N' activities:**
    *   This helps identify if specific automated systems or individuals are linked to these rapid, possibly approval-skipping, transitions.
    ```sql
    WITH Quick_E_N_Skipping_P AS (
        SELECT
            t1.claim_id,
            t1.resource AS evaluate_resource,
            t2.resource AS notify_resource
        FROM
            claim_events t1 -- 'E' event
        JOIN LATERAL (
            SELECT timestamp, resource FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = t1.claim_id AND activity = 'N' AND timestamp > t1.timestamp ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 1
        ) AS t2 ON TRUE
        WHERE t1.activity = 'E'
        AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp)) < 60
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce_mid
            WHERE ce_mid.claim_id = t1.claim_id AND ce_mid.timestamp > t1.timestamp AND ce_mid.timestamp < t2.timestamp AND ce_mid.activity = 'P'
        )
    )
    SELECT
        qen.evaluate_resource,
        qen.notify_resource,
        COUNT(qen.claim_id) AS num_quick_transitions
    FROM
        Quick_E_N_Skipping_P qen
    GROUP BY
        qen.evaluate_resource, qen.notify_resource
    ORDER BY
        num_quick_transitions DESC;
    ```
