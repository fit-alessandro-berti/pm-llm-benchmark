### Identifying Anomalies and Unwanted Behaviors

#### Anomaly 1: Delayed Payment
**Event Log Data:**
- Case ID: 1003
- Event ID: 20
- Activity: Receive Payment
- Timestamp: 2024-02-02 11:00:00
- Resource: FinanceTeam_02
- Additional Info: amount=1500.00

**Observation:**
The payment for order 1003 was received on 2024-02-02, which is two days after the order was registered (2024-02-01 08:45:00).

**Hypothesis:**
This delay might be due to a backlog in the payment processing system or a policy violation where the payment was not processed immediately.

**SQL Query to Investigate:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM order_event_log
WHERE case_id = 1003
  AND activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND timestamp > '2024-02-01 08:45:00';
```

#### Anomaly 2: Early Shipment Confirmation
**Event Log Data:**
- Case ID: 1002
- Event ID: 9
- Activity: Confirm Shipment
- Timestamp: 2024-02-01 08:25:00
- Resource: LogisticsMgr_2
- Additional Info: attempted_early=Y

**Observation:**
The shipment for order 1002 was confirmed early, which is unusual since the order was not yet fully processed.

**Hypothesis:**
This might be due to a system error or a policy violation where the shipment confirmation was triggered prematurely.

**SQL Query to Investigate:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM order_event_log
WHERE case_id = 1002
  AND activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = 1002 AND activity IN ('Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Issue Invoice'));
```

#### Anomaly 3: Missing Credit Check
**Event Log Data:**
- Case ID: 1004
- Event ID: 22
- Activity: Receive Payment
- Timestamp: 2024-02-01 09:05:00
- Resource: FinanceTeam_02
- Additional Info: amount=3000.00

**Observation:**
The payment for order 1004 was received before the credit check was performed.

**Hypothesis:**
This might be due to a system error or a policy violation where the credit check was skipped.

**SQL Query to Investigate:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM order_event_log
WHERE case_id = 1004
  AND activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = 1004 AND activity = 'Perform Credit Check');
```

### Proposed SQL Queries

1. **Investigate Delayed Payment:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id = 1003
     AND activity = 'Receive Payment'
     AND timestamp > '2024-02-01 08:45:00';
   ```

2. **Investigate Early Shipment Confirmation:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id = 1002
     AND activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
     AND timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = 1002 AND activity IN ('Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Issue Invoice'));
   ```

3. **Investigate Missing Credit Check:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id = 1004
     AND activity = 'Receive Payment'
     AND timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = 1004 AND activity = 'Perform Credit Check');
   ```

These queries will help in further investigating the anomalies and understanding the underlying causes.
