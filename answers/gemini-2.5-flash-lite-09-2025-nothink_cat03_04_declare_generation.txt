The prompt describes the structure of a DECLARE model output dictionary from `pm4py` but doesn't provide the *actual* support and confidence values derived from a specific event log.

Since the goal is to **construct the dictionary structure** based on the provided scenario and the definition, we will populate the structure with placeholder values (as implied by the prompt stating support is 1.0 for many cases, and using placeholder confidence values where actual calculation isn't possible).

In a real analysis, the support and confidence for each rule would be calculated from an event log. For this exercise, we use the structure and list all relevant activities.

### Constructed DECLARE Model Dictionary

```python
declare_model = {
    # --- Existence Rules (Activity must appear) ---
    'existence': {
        'IG': (1.0, 1.0),  # (Support, Confidence)
        'DD': (1.0, 1.0),
        'TFC': (1.0, 1.0),
        'CE': (1.0, 1.0),
        'PC': (1.0, 1.0),
        'LT': (1.0, 1.0),
        'UT': (1.0, 1.0),
        'AG': (1.0, 1.0),
        'MP': (1.0, 1.0),
        'FL': (1.0, 1.0),
    },

    # --- Absence Rules (Activity must never appear) ---
    # Assuming no activities are strictly forbidden across all traces for simplicity
    'absence': {
        # Example: If 'Rework' was an activity that should never happen
        # 'Rework': (0.0, 0.0) 
    },
    
    # --- Exactly One Rule (Only one of the set can occur) ---
    # Since testing (LT, UT) might be optional or sequential, we use a placeholder example
    'exactly_one': {
        # Example: Perhaps only one type of high-level approval is allowed, 
        # but based on the list, we'll leave it empty or define a hypothetical one.
    },
    
    # --- Init Rule (Activity must be the first in the trace) ---
    'init': {
        'IG': (1.0, 1.0)  # Idea Generation must always be the first step
    },

    # --- Relations based on trace ordering ---
    
    # 1. Responded Existence (If A happens, B must eventually happen)
    'responded_existence': {
        # If Technical Feasibility Check (TFC) occurs, Final Launch (FL) must occur later.
        'TFC': (1.0, 1.0)
    },
    
    # 2. Coexistence (A and B must happen in the same trace, order irrelevant)
    'coexistence': {
        # Design Draft (DD) and Cost Evaluation (CE) likely happen concurrently or as related prerequisites
        # 'DD': (1.0, 1.0) # Note: In pm4py output, this key holds rules like ('DD', 'CE'): (S, C)
    },

    # 3. Response (If A happens, B must happen *after* A)
    'response': {
        'DD': (1.0, 1.0),   # Design Draft must be followed by Technical Feasibility Check
        'LT': (1.0, 1.0),   # Lab Testing must precede Approval Gate
    },

    # 4. Precedence (A must happen before B)
    'precedence': {
        'TFC': (1.0, 1.0),  # TFC must precede Prototype Creation (PC)
        'AG': (1.0, 1.0),   # Approval Gate must precede Marketing Plan (MP)
    },

    # 5. Succession (A must be immediately followed by B)
    'succession': {
        # For simplicity, we assume the design path is sequential:
        'DD': (1.0, 1.0), # DD is immediately followed by TFC (Hypothetical)
    },

    # 6. Alternative Response (If A happens, either B or C must follow)
    'altresponse': {
        # If Prototype Creation (PC) happens, either Lab Testing (LT) or User Testing (UT) happens later (assuming they are alternatives)
        # 'PC': (1.0, 1.0)
    },
    
    # 7. Alternative Precedence (Either A or B must precede C)
    'altprecedence': {
        # 'LT': (1.0, 1.0) # Hypothetical rule structure
    },

    # 8. Alternative Succession (A must be immediately followed by either B or C)
    'altsuccession': {
        # 'CE': (1.0, 1.0) # Hypothetical rule structure
    },

    # 9. Chain Response (A must eventually be followed by B, which must eventually be followed by C)
    'chainresponse': {
        # 'IG': (1.0, 1.0) # Chain: IG -> DD -> TFC
    },

    # 10. Chain Precedence (A must precede B, which must precede C)
    'chainprecedence': {
        # 'TFC': (1.0, 1.0) # Chain: TFC -> PC -> LT
    },

    # 11. Chain Succession (A immediately followed by B, immediately followed by C)
    'chainsuccession': {
        # 'MP': (1.0, 1.0) # Chain: MP -> FL -> End
    },
    
    # 12. Non-Coexistence (A and B cannot happen in the same trace)
    'noncoexistence': {
        # If TFC is successful, maybe 'UT' (User Testing) is skipped entirely.
        # 'TFC': (1.0, 1.0) # Hypothetical structure: If TFC occurs, UT does not occur.
    },

    # 13. Non-Succession (A must not be immediately followed by B)
    'nonsuccession': {
        # 'CE': (1.0, 1.0) # Hypothetical: Cost Evaluation must not be immediately followed by Lab Testing
    },

    # 14. Non-Chain Succession (A must not be immediately followed by B, which must not be immediately followed by C)
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        # 'DD': (1.0, 1.0) # Hypothetical structure
    }
}
