Based on the provided sample event log, I've identified and grouped the low-level events into the following meaningful, higher-level process steps:

**Proposed High-Level Process Steps:**

1.  **Material Handling and Preparation**
2.  **Assembly (Welding)**
3.  **Surface Treatment**
4.  **Quality Inspection**

**Rationale for Groupings and Naming:**

Here's the detailed rationale for each proposed high-level activity and the low-level events included:

**1. Material Handling and Preparation**

*   **Included Low-Level Events:**
    *   Retrieve raw metal sheet
    *   Scan barcode
    *   Place metal sheet on table
    *   Align metal sheet
    *   Preheat metal sheet

*   **Rationale:** This group of events focuses on the initial steps required to get the raw material ready for subsequent processing. They are all related to the handling and initial manipulation of the base material. The "Retrieve," "Scan," and "Place" events physically prepare the material, while "Align" and "Preheat" prepare it for the next stage (welding). They occur sequentially at the beginning of the process for each case.

*   **Proposed Name:** **Material Handling and Preparation** (or simply "Material Preparation") - This name accurately reflects the activities of acquiring, identifying, positioning, and initially processing the raw material.

**2. Assembly (Welding)**

*   **Included Low-Level Events:**
    *   Pick up welding tool
    *   Weld corner A
    *   Weld corner B

*   **Rationale:** These events are directly related to the core joining or assembly step of the product. Picking up the tool is a prerequisite for the welding actions, which are the primary activities in this phase. These events are performed by the same resource (Operator B in this sample) and occur consecutively after the material preparation.

*   **Proposed Name:** **Assembly (Welding)** (or simply "Welding") - "Assembly" is a general term for joining components, and "Welding" specifies the particular method used in this log.

**3. Surface Treatment**

*   **Included Low-Level Events:**
    *   Apply protective coating
    *   Dry coating

*   **Rationale:** These events represent steps performed on the surface of the product after the main assembly is complete. Applying a coating and then drying it are logically linked and serve a distinct purpose – protecting and finishing the product's surface.

*   **Proposed Name:** **Surface Treatment** (or "Coating and Drying") - "Surface Treatment" is a broad term encompassing processes like coating, which fits well here. "Coating and Drying" is more specific to the observed actions.

**4. Quality Inspection**

*   **Included Low-Level Events:**
    *   Measure weld integrity
    *   Visual check

*   **Rationale:** These events are explicitly focused on verifying the quality of the product after the assembly and surface treatment phases. They involve assessing specific attributes (weld integrity) and performing a general assessment (visual check) to ensure the product meets quality standards. These typically occur at the end of production stages.

*   **Proposed Name:** **Quality Inspection** (or "Quality Check") - This name clearly describes the purpose of these events.

**Summary of High-Level Activities and Corresponding Low-Level Events:**

| High-Level Activity             | Low-Level Events Included                                     | Rationale Summary                                                                 |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Material Handling and Prep.** | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet | Initial steps to acquire, identify, position, and prepare the base material.   |
| **Assembly (Welding)**          | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B            | Core joining/assembly actions using welding.                                      |
| **Surface Treatment**           | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                         | Actions performed on the product's surface after assembly for protection/finishing. |
| **Quality Inspection**          | Measure weld integrity, Visual check                          | Steps taken to verify the quality of the product.                                 |

This structured approach allows us to view the manufacturing process for each case at a more abstract and understandable level, moving from granular machine and operator actions to coherent process stages.
