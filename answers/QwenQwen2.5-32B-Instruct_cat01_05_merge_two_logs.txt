To merge the two logs into a single, enriched event log, we'll follow the provided requirements and context closely. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Timestamp Tolerance and Event Matching**: We'll use a 2-second tolerance to match events based on the timestamp. Events with similar timestamps (within 2 seconds) and the same order ID will be considered the same event for merging purposes.

2. **Event Name Mapping**: We need to map similar event names from both logs to identify matches:
   - `Order Received` (Log A)  `OrderReceived` (Log B)
   - `Order Validated` (Log A)  `OrderValidation` (Log B)
   - `Payment Processed` (Log A)  `PaymentCheck` (Log B)
   - `Item Shipped` (Log A)  `Shipping` (Log B)
   - `Item Delivered` (Log A) does not have a direct match in Log B.

3. **Merging Events**: For each match, we'll merge the attributes from both logs. If an event in one log has no match in the other, it will be included as-is.

4. **Final Output**: The merged events will be presented in chronological order based on the primary timestamp (from Log A if available, otherwise from Log B).

### Merged Event Log

```
2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, Order Received, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"
2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, Order Validated, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"
2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"
2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection"  # Only in Log B
2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"
2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234  # Only in Log A
```

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Order Received**:  
   - Log A: `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z`
   - Log B: `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z` (within 2-second tolerance)
   - Merged Event: `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, Order Received, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"`

2. **Order Validated**:  
   - Log A: `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z`
   - Log B: `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z` (within 2-second tolerance)
   - Merged Event: `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, Order Validated, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"`

3. **Payment Processed**:  
   - Log A: `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z`
   - Log B: `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z` (within 2-second tolerance)
   - Merged Event: `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"`

4. **Quality Check**:  
   - Only in Log B: `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection"`

5. **Item Shipped**:  
   - Log A: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z`
   - Log B: `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z` (within 2-second tolerance)
   - Merged Event: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"`

6. **Item Delivered**:  
   - Only in Log A: `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234`

### Summary
- Events `Order Received`, `Order Validated`, `Payment Processed`, and `Item Shipped` were successfully merged based on the timestamp tolerance and event name mapping.
- `Quality Check` from Log B and `Item Delivered` from Log A were included as they had no matching events in the other log.
- The merged events are presented in chronological order based on the timestamps.

This approach ensures that we have an enriched and consistent event log reflecting the order fulfillment process with all available attributes.
