Let’s analyze the event log step-by-step to identify cases with performance issues, determine root causes based on the attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity), and propose explanations and mitigation strategies.
Step 1: Calculate Case Durations
To identify cases with significantly longer durations, we calculate the total lead time for each case from "Submit Claim" to "Close Claim." All timestamps are in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM," and we’ll compute the duration in hours.
Case 2001:
Start: 2024-04-01 09:00
End: 2024-04-01 10:30
Duration: 1.5 hours
Case 2002:
Start: 2024-04-01 09:05
End: 2024-04-02 11:00
Duration: 25.92 hours (1 day + 1 hour 55 minutes)
Case 2003:
Start: 2024-04-01 09:10
End: 2024-04-03 09:30
Duration: 48.33 hours (2 days + 20 minutes)
Case 2004:
Start: 2024-04-01 09:20
End: 2024-04-01 10:45
Duration: 1.42 hours (1 hour 25 minutes)
Case 2005:
Start: 2024-04-01 09:25
End: 2024-04-04 14:30
Duration: 77.08 hours (3 days + 5 hours 5 minutes)
Summary of Durations:
Case 2001: 1.5 hours
Case 2002: 25.92 hours
Case 2003: 48.33 hours
Case 2004: 1.42 hours
Case 2005: 77.08 hours
Observation:
Cases 2002, 2003, and 2005 have significantly longer durations (ranging from 26 to 77 hours) compared to Cases 2001 and 2004 (1.5 hours). These three cases warrant further investigation.
Step 2: Analyze Attributes and Correlate with Long Lead Times
We’ll examine the attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity) for the cases with longer durations (2002, 2003, 2005) and compare them to the faster cases (2001, 2004).

Analysis of Attributes:
Complexity:
Low Complexity (2001, 2004): Durations of 1.5 and 1.42 hours, no requests for additional documents.
Medium Complexity (2002): 25.92 hours, 1 request.
High Complexity (2003, 2005): 48.33 and 77.08 hours, 2 and 3 requests, respectively.
Correlation: Higher complexity strongly correlates with longer durations and more requests for additional documents.
Region:
Region A (2001, 2003): Durations of 1.5 hours (Low) and 48.33 hours (High).
Region B (2002, 2004, 2005): Durations of 25.92 hours (Medium), 1.42 hours (Low), and 77.08 hours (High).
Observation: Region B handles both the longest case (2005) and a very fast case (2004). Region alone doesn’t consistently predict delays; it interacts with complexity.
Resource:
Adjuster_Lisa (2002, 2004, 2005): Handles cases with durations of 25.92 hours (Medium), 1.42 hours (Low), and 77.08 hours (High). She requests additional documents in Medium and High complexity cases (1, 0, and 3 requests).
Adjuster_Mike (2001, 2003): Handles cases with 1.5 hours (Low) and 48.33 hours (High), with 0 and 2 requests.
Managers (Ann, Bill): Ann approves faster (same-day in 2001, 2002, 2004), while Bill’s approvals take longer (2003, 2005).
Observation: Adjuster_Lisa is involved in the longest case (2005) with multiple document requests. Manager_Bill’s involvement correlates with delays compared to Manager_Ann.
Number of "Request Additional Documents":
0 requests: 1.5 hours (2001), 1.42 hours (2004).
1 request: 25.92 hours (2002).
2 requests: 48.33 hours (2003).
3 requests: 77.08 hours (2005).
Correlation: More requests strongly correlate with longer durations.
Step 3: Root Causes and Mitigation Suggestions
Root Causes:
High Complexity Increases Document Requests:
Cases 2003 and 2005 (High complexity) required multiple "Request Additional Documents" events (2 and 3), significantly extending lead times. Complexity likely introduces ambiguity or incomplete initial submissions.
Resource-Specific Behaviors:
Adjuster_Lisa tends to request additional documents more frequently (e.g., 3 times in Case 2005) compared to Adjuster_Mike (max 2 in Case 2003). This could indicate stricter evaluation criteria or inefficiencies in her process.
Manager_Bill approves claims later than Manager_Ann (e.g., next-day approvals in 2003 and 2005 vs. same-day in 2001, 2002, 2004), suggesting slower decision-making or higher workload.
Region B with High Complexity:
Case 2005 (Region B, High complexity) is the longest, with 77.08 hours and 3 document requests. Region B may lack resources or expertise to handle complex claims efficiently, unlike Region A, where Case 2003 (High complexity) took 48.33 hours.
Explanations:
Complexity: High-complexity claims require more scrutiny and documentation, naturally extending the process. However, multiple requests suggest gaps in initial submissions or inefficiencies in evaluation.
Resource: Adjuster_Lisa’s frequent document requests and Manager_Bill’s delayed approvals indicate individual performance or workload issues. Adjuster_Lisa may be overly cautious, while Manager_Bill might be a bottleneck.
Region: Region B’s longest case (2005) could reflect staffing shortages, slower communication with claimants, or less streamlined processes for complex cases compared to Region A.
Mitigation Suggestions:
Streamline High-Complexity Claims:
Implement a pre-submission checklist for high-complexity claims to reduce the need for multiple document requests.
Train adjusters to identify and request all necessary documents in a single step.
Optimize Resource Allocation:
Review Adjuster_Lisa’s workload or evaluation process to reduce unnecessary document requests. Provide guidelines on when additional documents are truly required.
Distribute Manager_Bill’s approvals to other managers (e.g., Manager_Ann) or expedite his decision-making with automated support tools.
Enhance Region B’s Capacity:
Investigate staffing or process differences in Region B. Add resources or adopt Region A’s best practices for handling complex claims.
Improve communication channels in Region B to speed up document collection from claimants.
Conclusion
Cases with Performance Issues: 2002 (25.92 hours), 2003 (48.33 hours), and 2005 (77.08 hours).
Root Causes: High complexity, multiple document requests (especially by Adjuster_Lisa), slower approvals by Manager_Bill, and potential inefficiencies in Region B.
Recommendations: Standardize document requests, optimize resource performance, and enhance Region B’s processes to reduce lead times.
