Here's a DuckDB SQL query that filters out cases with more than six events and returns only the events from cases with six or fewer events:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_event_counts cec
    ON el.case_id = cec.case_id
WHERE cec.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation:
1. **CTE (Common Table Expression) `case_event_counts`:** This part of the query calculates the number of events for each `case_id` by grouping the events based on `case_id` and counting the occurrences.
2. **Main query:** 
   - The main query joins the `event_log` table (`el`) with the CTE (`cec`) on `case_id` to get the event details for each case.
   - The `WHERE` clause filters the cases, ensuring that only those with six or fewer events (`cec.event_count <= 6`) are included in the result.

This ensures that the result only includes events from cases with six or fewer events in total.
