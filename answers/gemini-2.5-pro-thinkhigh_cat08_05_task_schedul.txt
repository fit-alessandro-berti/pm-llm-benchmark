Excellent. This is a classic and challenging scenario that perfectly illustrates the power of combining process mining with advanced operational research techniques. As a Senior Operations Analyst, here is my detailed, data-driven approach to transform Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling performance.

***

### Executive Summary

Precision Parts Inc.'s operational challenges—tardiness, high WIP, and unpredictability—are symptoms of a fundamental mismatch between its complex, dynamic manufacturing environment and its simplistic, reactive scheduling rules. This proposal outlines a comprehensive framework to move from anecdotal decision-making to a data-driven, predictive, and optimized scheduling paradigm. By leveraging process mining on existing MES event logs, we will first create a transparent, factual model of the current operations. This model will allow us to precisely diagnose performance issues and their root causes. Subsequently, we will design, simulate, and deploy advanced scheduling strategies that dynamically adapt to shop floor conditions, optimize for key objectives like minimizing setup times and tardiness, and provide a foundation for continuous improvement.

### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

The first step is to transform the raw MES event log into an objective, quantitative understanding of the *actual* shop floor reality. This involves using process mining to reconstruct the end-to-end journey of every job.

**Methodology:**

We will process the MES event log, ensuring it contains the three essential columns for process mining:
*   **Case ID:** `Case ID (Job ID)`
*   **Activity:** A combination of `Activity/Task` and `Event Type` (e.g., 'Cutting_Start', 'Cutting_End', 'Milling_Queue_Entry').
*   **Timestamp:** `Timestamp`

All other columns (`Resource`, `Operator ID`, `Order Priority`, etc.) will be used as attributes for deep-dive analysis.

**Specific Process Mining Techniques and Metrics:**

*   **Job Flow, Lead Times, and Makespan:**
    *   **Technique:** Process Discovery and Performance Dashboarding. We will automatically generate a process map (often called a "spaghetti model") showing all paths jobs take through the shop.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Cycle Time (Lead Time):** Calculated as `(Last Event Timestamp - First Event Timestamp)` for each `Case ID`. We will analyze the distribution (histogram, median, 90th percentile), not just the average, to understand predictability.
        *   **Makespan:** The time to complete a specific batch of jobs. This is less relevant for a continuous job shop but useful for analyzing performance over a given week or month.

*   **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):**
    *   **Technique:** Bottleneck Analysis and Dotted Chart Analysis.
    *   **Metrics:** For each task, we will calculate the **Waiting Time** as `(Task Start Timestamp - Queue Entry Timestamp)`. We will aggregate this by `Resource (Machine ID)` and `Activity/Task` to identify where jobs spend the most time waiting. A high average waiting time at a resource is a primary indicator of a bottleneck.

*   **Resource Utilization:**
    *   **Technique:** Resource-centric analysis dashboards.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Productive Utilization:** `(Sum of Actual Task Durations) / (Total Scheduled Time)`.
        *   **Setup Utilization:** `(Sum of Actual Setup Durations) / (Total Scheduled Time)`.
        *   **Idle Time:** Time when a resource is available but has no job in its queue.
        *   **Starvation Time:** Idle time when jobs *are* available elsewhere in the system but have not reached the resource yet.
        *   **Downtime:** Derived from 'Breakdown Start' and 'Breakdown End' events.

*   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
    *   **Technique:** Contextual attribute analysis.
    *   **Analysis:** For each machine (`Resource`), we will chronologically order all tasks. We will create a "transition matrix" by looking at consecutive jobs. The "Notes" field (`Previous job: JOB-6998`) is invaluable. We will build a model that maps `(Previous_Job_Properties, Current_Job_Properties) -> Actual_Setup_Duration`. Job properties can include material type, part family, or required tooling, which can be joined from the order master data. This gives us a powerful empirical model of setup times.

*   **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
    *   **Technique:** Conformance Checking (if a planned schedule exists) and KPI monitoring.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Tardiness:** For each completed job, calculate `max(0, Job_Completion_Timestamp - Order_Due_Date)`. We will analyze the frequency of tardy jobs, the average and maximum tardiness in hours/days, and correlate tardiness with specific job routes or priorities.
        *   **Schedule Adherence:** We will compare the `Planned Task Duration` with the `Actual Task Duration` (`Task End - Task Start`). A systematic deviation indicates poor planning estimates.

*   **Impact of Disruptions:**
    *   **Technique:** Variant Analysis and Filtering.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **Breakdowns:** Filter for all jobs that were in the queue for or being processed by `MILL-02` during its breakdown. We can then measure the "delay ripple" by tracking the subsequent tardiness of these jobs compared to similar jobs that were not affected.
        *   **Priority Changes:** Create two cohorts of jobs: those with `Priority Change` events and those without. Compare their end-to-end lead times and their impact on the waiting times of other jobs processed on the same machines. This will quantify the cost of expediting "hot jobs."

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

The analysis from Step 1 will provide concrete evidence of systemic inefficiencies.

*   **Identification of Bottlenecks:** The bottleneck analysis will rank resources by total waiting time. For example, we might find that **CNC Mill `MILL-03`** accounts for 40% of all job waiting time in the entire shop, despite having only 85% utilization. This suggests an inefficiency beyond simple capacity overload.

*   **Evidence of Poor Task Prioritization:**
    *   **Technique:** Variant Analysis. We will compare the process map of "On-Time High-Priority Jobs" against "Late High-Priority Jobs".
    *   **Evidence:** The analysis might reveal that late high-priority jobs consistently get stuck in queues behind medium or low-priority jobs at non-bottleneck resources like `CUT-01`. This demonstrates that the local FCFS rule is overriding the global EDD/priority goal, causing high-value work to wait unnecessarily.

*   **Instances of Suboptimal Sequencing (High Setup Times):**
    *   **Technique:** Using the sequence-dependent setup model from Step 1.
    *   **Evidence:** We can scan the historical log for a bottleneck machine (e.g., `HEAT-01`). We might find a sequence like `(Job A: Steel) -> (Job B: Aluminum) -> (Job C: Steel)`. Our model shows the steel-to-aluminum setup is 90 minutes, and aluminum-to-steel is 75 minutes. Had the sequence been `(Job A) -> (Job C) -> (Job B)`, the total setup time could have been reduced by over an hour (steel-to-steel setup might be 15 mins). Aggregating these lost hours quantifies the cost of sequence-unaware dispatching.

*   **Starvation of Downstream Resources:**
    *   **Technique:** Resource correlation analysis.
    *   **Evidence:** We might see that the `GRIND-02` machine has low utilization (45%) but experiences frequent, short bursts of activity followed by long periods of idle time. The process map will show that 90% of its work comes directly from the primary bottleneck, `MILL-03`. This proves that `GRIND-02` is being starved by the upstream bottleneck, and its low utilization is a symptom, not a sign of excess capacity.

*   **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:**
    *   **Technique:** Time-series analysis of WIP.
    *   **Evidence:** By plotting the number of jobs in "Queue Entry" status over time for each work center, we can visualize inventory levels. We would likely see relatively stable WIP at the first station, but increasingly erratic and amplified WIP levels at downstream stations, a classic bullwhip signature caused by variability and lack of coordination.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

Diagnosing pathologies is knowing *what* is wrong. Root cause analysis is knowing *why*.

*   **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:** The core issue. Rules like FCFS and EDD are "myopic"—they optimize locally without considering the global state. An EDD rule at the cutting station might rush a job that will then sit for three days at the overloaded milling station, while a different job with a later due date could have been processed that was destined for an idle lathing machine. Process mining provides the data to prove this domino effect.

*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** The current rules lack foresight. They don't know that `MILL-02` is about to go down for planned maintenance or that the queue for `GRIND-02` is empty and it will soon be starved.

*   **Inaccurate Estimations:** By comparing `Task Duration (Planned)` vs. `Task Duration (Actual)`, we can build a statistical model of estimation accuracy. If we find that planned times are, on average, 30% too optimistic, any schedule built on them is guaranteed to fail.

*   **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:** This is a direct cause of lost capacity at bottleneck resources. The root cause is a scheduling logic that is blind to the `(Previous Job -> Current Job)` cost matrix.

*   **Differentiating Scheduling Logic vs. Capacity Limitations:**
    *   Process mining helps distinguish these clearly. A **true capacity limitation** would be a resource with consistently high utilization (>90%) and a perpetually long queue, even when analyzing sequences that appear efficient. The only solution is adding capacity or offloading work.
    *   A **scheduling logic failure** is identified when a resource has moderate utilization (e.g., 70%) but also high waiting times. This indicates that work arrives in inefficient "lumps," with periods of starvation followed by overload. High total setup times relative to processing time on a machine are another clear signal of a scheduling logic problem, not a capacity one.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

We will propose moving from static rules to dynamic, data-informed strategies.

#### Strategy 1: Dynamic Composite Dispatching Rule (D-CDR)

This is an advanced, multi-factor rule applied in real-time at each work center.

*   **Core Logic:** Instead of FCFS or EDD, the next job to be processed from the queue is selected based on a calculated priority score. The formula would be a weighted sum of critical factors:
    `Score = w1*(Priority) + w2*(Critical_Ratio) + w3*(1 / Est_Setup_Time) + w4*(Downstream_Bottleneck_Queue)`
    *   **Priority:** The business priority (`High`=3, `Medium`=2, `Low`=1).
    *   **Critical Ratio (CR):** `(Time_until_Due_Date) / (Remaining_Total_Processing_Time)`. A CR < 1 means the job is already projected to be late.
    *   **Est. Setup Time:** The expected setup time for the job, based on the job currently on the machine. This comes directly from our process-mined setup time model.
    *   **Downstream Bottleneck Queue:** A factor that de-prioritizes jobs whose next step is a heavily congested bottleneck.
*   **Data Source:** The weights (`w1`, `w2`, etc.) are not arbitrary; they will be tuned via simulation (see Step 5) to optimize for the company's primary goal (e.g., minimizing tardiness). The setup and processing time estimates are fed from our process mining analysis.
*   **Pathology Addressed:** Poor task prioritization, suboptimal sequencing at a local level.
*   **Expected Impact:** Significant reduction in tardiness and total setup time. More balanced flow by avoiding sending work to already-swamped machines.

#### Strategy 2: Predictive Lead Time & Proactive Bottleneck Management

This strategy focuses on providing accurate promises to customers and mitigating risks before they materialize.

*   **Core Logic:**
    1.  **Predictive Duration Modeling:** Use machine learning (e.g., a gradient boosting model) trained on the historical log to predict the `Actual Task Duration` and `Setup Time` for any given task, using features like `Job_Type`, `Material`, `Resource`, `Operator_Experience_Level`, etc.
    2.  **"What-If" Simulation:** When a new order inquiry arrives, run a fast simulation of its likely path through the current shop floor state (WIP, machine queues) using the predictive duration models. This generates a statistically robust completion date estimate (e.g., "We are 90% confident this job will be completed by May 15th").
    3.  **Proactive Alerting:** The system constantly simulates the progress of all active jobs. If it predicts that a future bottleneck will emerge in the next 8 hours, it alerts the production manager, who can take proactive steps (e.g., authorize overtime, re-route a non-critical job).
*   **Data Source:** The entire historical event log, including resource states, operator data, and actual timings.
*   **Pathology Addressed:** Unpredictable lead times, reactive handling of disruptions.
*   **Expected Impact:** Dramatically improved on-time delivery (OTD) and customer satisfaction. Reduced chaos from "hot jobs" by anticipating delays.

#### Strategy 3: Global Sequencing Optimization for Bottlenecks

This strategy focuses on maximizing throughput at the one or two machines that constrain the entire system's output.

*   **Core Logic:** For the primary bottleneck machine(s) identified in Step 1, we stop using simple dispatching rules. Instead, we treat the queue as a batch-sequencing problem. A global optimization algorithm (e.g., a Genetic Algorithm or Ant Colony Optimization) runs periodically (e.g., every hour) to determine the optimal sequence for the next *N* jobs in the queue. The objective function is to `minimize(Total_Setup_Time + Total_Tardiness_Penalty)`.
*   **Data Source:** The sequence-dependent setup time matrix from process mining is the critical input (the "cost" of moving between jobs). Job due dates and remaining processing times are also key inputs.
*   **Pathology Addressed:** Bottleneck under-utilization due to excessive setup times; starvation of downstream resources.
*   **Expected Impact:** Increased capacity and throughput of the entire plant by "unlocking" hidden capacity at the bottleneck. Smoother flow to downstream work centers.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

Deploying a new scheduling system live is risky. We must rigorously test and validate it first.

*   **Discrete-Event Simulation:**
    *   We will build a digital twin of the Precision Parts Inc. shop floor using a discrete-event simulation tool.
    *   **Parameterization:** This model will be parameterized *entirely* from our process mining analysis:
        *   **Task Durations:** Modeled as statistical distributions (e.g., log-normal, Weibull) fitted to the historical data, not fixed averages.
        *   **Job Routings:** The variant analysis from process mining defines the probability of a job taking a specific path.
        *   **Breakdowns:** Machine availability will be modeled using MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) and MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) calculated from the `Breakdown` events in the log.
        *   **Setup Matrix:** The sequence-dependent setup time model will be a core component of the simulation logic.
    *   **Testing:** We will run thousands of simulated production weeks, comparing the baseline (current FCFS/EDD rules) against Strategy 1, 2, and 3. We will test under various scenarios: baseline load, 20% increased load, and high disruption (doubling breakdown frequency). The simulation will output KPIs like tardiness, WIP, and throughput, allowing us to quantitatively prove which strategy is superior.

*   **Continuous Improvement Framework:**
    *   The chosen scheduling strategy is not static. We will implement a continuous monitoring loop.
    *   **Monitor:** The MES log will be continuously fed into our process mining platform, updating our dashboards and KPIs in near real-time.
    *   **Detect:** We will set up automated triggers. For example, if the average waiting time at `MILL-03` increases by 15% over a two-week period, an alert is sent to the operations team. If the prediction accuracy of our duration model drops, it's a signal for retraining.
    *   **Adapt:** These detections trigger a re-evaluation. Perhaps the product mix has changed, requiring the weights in our D-CDR (Strategy 1) to be re-tuned via simulation. Perhaps a new machine has been added, requiring the entire process model to be updated. This creates a resilient, self-improving system that adapts to the evolving reality of the business.
