### Analysis of Loan Application Process Compliance

#### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**
Normative rules are strict constraints that must never be violated. The following cases breach these rules:

- **Case 2: Critical Normative Violations**  
  **Reasons for Violation:**  
  - **Incorrect Order:** Risk Assessment occurred at 08:20 on 2024-01-11, *before* Credit Check at 09:00. This violates the rule: "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."  
  - **Skipped Activity:** The required "Inform Applicant" step is entirely missing after "Loan Decision (Rejected)." This skips a mandatory activity in the sequence.  
  - **Contradictory Action:** "Finalize Documentation" occurred at 10:00 after a rejection. This violates the rule: "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."  
  - **Sequence Deviation:** The process executed Risk Assessment  Credit Check  Loan Decision, skipping the mandatory order (Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment).  

  **Interpretation/Justification:**  
  These violations suggest a systemic error, such as:  
  - Misconfigured workflow automation where activities triggered out of order.  
  - Human oversight (e.g., rushing steps or misunderstanding rejection protocols).  
  - Data logging errors (e.g., timestamps misaligned with actual execution).  
  **Impact:** These are severe deviations compromising process integrity and compliance.

#### **2. Cases Failing Desiderata Conditions**
Desiderata are recommended best practices; deviations are suboptimal but not violations. 

- **Case 1: Minor Desideratum Failure**  
  - **Issue:** No "Follow-up Call" was performed before closing the case.  
  - **Severity:** Low (encouraged but not required).  
  - **Interpretation:** The team likely omitted this due to time constraints or deemed it unnecessary for a straightforward approval.  

- **Case 2: Minor Desideratum Failure**  
  - **Issue:** No "Follow-up Call" was performed.  
  - **Severity:** Low (overshadowed by normative violations).  

- **Case 3: Multiple Desideratum Failures**  
  - **Issues:**  
    1. **Credit Check Delay:** Occurred 49 hours after "Application Received" (exceeds 24-hour recommendation).  
    2. **Inform Applicant Delay:** Occurred 51 hours after "Loan Decision (Approved)" (exceeds 48-hour recommendation).  
    3. **Missing Follow-up Call.**  
  - **Severity:** Low (non-binding recommendations).  
  - **Interpretation/Justification:**  
    - Timing delays likely stem from non-working days (e.g., weekends/holidays). Case 3 started on a Friday (2024-01-12), with Credit Check on Sunday (2024-01-14) and Inform Applicant on Tuesday (2024-01-16). If the organization operates only on weekdays, the delays are justifiable.  
    - The omitted Follow-up Call may reflect resource prioritization or low-risk case assessment.  

#### **3. Summary of Compliance**
| Case | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Failures? | Key Issues |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|------------|
| 1    |  No                  |  Yes (minor)       | Missing Follow-up Call. |
| 2    |  Yes (severe)        |  Yes (minor)       | Incorrect order, skipped activity, contradictory action. |
| 3    |  No                  |  Yes (multiple)    | Credit Check delay, Inform Applicant delay, missing Follow-up Call. |

#### **Key Insights**
- **Normative Violations (Case 2):** Require immediate remediation (e.g., workflow audits, staff retraining).  
- **Desiderata Failures (Cases 1 & 3):** Reflect suboptimal efficiency but are acceptable if justified (e.g., weekends). Consider timing adjustments if delays are frequent.  
- **Process Optimization:** Recommend automated alerts for:  
  - Sequence/order deviations (e.g., blocking Risk Assessment if Credit Check is pending).  
  - Timing desiderata (e.g., reminders for Credit Check/Inform Applicant deadlines).  
  - Optional Follow-up Call prompts to enhance applicant experience.
