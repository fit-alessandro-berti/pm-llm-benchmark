We are going to use a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery to first count the number of events per case_id.
 Then, we will use that count to filter the original event_log table, only keeping cases with count <= 6.
 Steps:
 1. Count the events per case_id (let's call this `case_counts`).
 2. Join the original `event_log` with `case_counts` on `case_id` and filter where the count <= 6.

 Alternatively, we can use the `WITH` clause for the counts and then do an inner join.

To solve this problem, we need to retrieve all events from cases that contain six or fewer events from the `event_log` table. This involves counting the events per case, filtering out cases with more than six events, and then returning the relevant event records.

### Approach
1. **Count Events per Case**: Use a common table expression (CTE) to calculate the number of events for each `case_id`.
2. **Filter Cases**: Select only the `case_id`s where the event count is six or fewer.
3. **Retrieve Events**: Join the filtered `case_id`s back with the original `event_log` to get all events from these cases.

This approach ensures we efficiently filter cases based on their event count and retrieve the complete event records for the qualifying cases.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
INNER JOIN
    case_counts cc
    ON el.case_id = cc.case_id;
```

### Explanation
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `case_counts`**:
   - Groups events by `case_id`.
   - Uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to include only cases with six or fewer events.
2. **Main Query**:
   - Joins the original `event_log` with the `case_counts` CTE on `case_id`.
   - Selects all columns from `event_log` for cases that meet the criteria.

This method efficiently filters cases using aggregation and a join, ensuring optimal performance without unnecessary subqueries or complex operations.
