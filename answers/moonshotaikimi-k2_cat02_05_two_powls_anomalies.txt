Analysis of the two POWL variations against a typical Hire-to-Retire process (simplified):

Standard happy-path (normative) sequence  
Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision  (if “hire”) Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case.  
In addition:  
• Screening must precede Interview (candidates must be pre-filtered before interviews).  
• Interview must precede/reach the decision point (the evidence for the hiring decision comes from interviews).  
• Onboarding and payroll follow a positive hiring outcome.  

----------------------------------------------------------------
POWL Model 1

Graph edges enforce:

Post  Screen  
Screen  InterviewandScreen  Decide  
Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close

Deviations/Anomalies

1. Non-normative order of Interview over Decide  
   • Screen  Decide is allowed.  
   • Screen  Interview is also allowed, but the model does **not** enforce **Interview  Decide**.  
   Result: Execution traces that skip interviews entirely (Post  Screen  Decide  …) are formally possible.  
   Severity: HIGH – Hiring decisions may be taken without conducting any interviews, which is usually contrary to policy and introduces legal/regulatory risk.

2. Payroll without onboarding is impossible  
   The model is otherwise a simple total order on Onboard->Payroll->Close, so no further anomalies here.

----------------------------------------------------------------
POWL Model 2

Structure:

- Choice/XOR for “add payroll or skip payroll”.  
- Loop operator on Onboarding with an invisible skip, allowing endless optional repeats of Onboard.  
- Order edges:

Post  Screen  
Post  Interview(Note: same source)  
Interview  Decide  
Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close

Deviations/Anomalies

1. Parallelism of Screen and Interview at Post’s successor  
   Post {Screen, Interview}. In practice an interview cannot start until some screening has started (to know who to invite).  
   Severity: MEDIUM – could lead to scheduling noise, but most companies would simply enforce a de-facto ordering at run-time.

2. Optional payroll (XOR {Payroll, skip})  
   Severity: HIGH – an employee can be onboarded successfully without ever being added to payroll. The payroll step is mandatory for actual hire completion.

3. loop_onboarding permits endless repetition of Onboarding (and possible omission), but it can also be exited on the next iteration by choosing “skip”. This is a modelling over-flexibility, yet **only** a matter of added complexity; the loop itself does **not** fundamentally violate business rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Which model is closer to the normative process?

Model 1 places Interview and Decide in **parallel** after Screen. This means **no guarantee that interviews actually occur before a decision is made**, which constitutes a serious control failure; a hiring manager could simply ignore interviews.

Model 2 never completely breaks the “Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll/on or off” chain, even though it creates occasionally awkward constructs (parallel Screen/Interview, optional payroll). The “optional payroll” is more easily corrected by replacing the XOR with a simple mandatory transition than fixing the fundamental sequencing error of Model 1.

Conclusion: Model 2 deviates in softer ways and can be aligned to the ideal flow more readily. Therefore, **Model 2 aligns more closely with the normative Hire-to-Retire process** even though Model 1 may at first glance look simpler.
