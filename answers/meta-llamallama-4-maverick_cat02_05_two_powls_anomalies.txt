## Step 1: Understand the standard Hire-to-Retire process
The standard Hire-to-Retire process involves a series of activities: posting a job advertisement, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding a new employee, adding the employee to the payroll system, and closing the case. The typical order is: Post Job Ad -> Screen Candidates -> Conduct Interviews -> Make Hiring Decision -> Onboard Employee -> Add to Payroll -> Close Case.

## Step 2: Analyze POWL Model 1
POWL Model 1 is defined with a strict partial order. The activities are: Post_Job_Ad, Screen_Candidates, Conduct_Interviews, Make_Hiring_Decision, Onboard_Employee, Add_to_Payroll, and Close_Case. The order is defined as follows: Post -> Screen, Screen -> Decide, Screen -> Interview, Decide -> Onboard, Onboard -> Payroll, Payroll -> Close. This implies that "Screen_Candidates" is followed by both "Make_Hiring_Decision" and "Conduct_Interviews" without a clear order between the latter two, which is not standard but could be interpreted as allowing "Conduct_Interviews" to happen either before or after "Make_Hiring_Decision" if we consider the edge from Screen to Decide and Screen to Interview. However, the edge from Screen to Decide and then Decide to Onboard suggests a decision is made after screening and possibly interviewing.

## Step 3: Identify anomalies in POWL Model 1
In POWL Model 1, "Conduct_Interviews" and "Make_Hiring_Decision" are not ordered with respect to each other directly, but "Screen_Candidates" precedes both. This could imply that interviews might happen after the hiring decision, which is unconventional because typically, a hiring decision is made after conducting interviews. The model suggests that "Screen_Candidates" directly precedes "Make_Hiring_Decision", which might not always be the case as interviews usually follow screening.

## Step 4: Analyze POWL Model 2
POWL Model 2 includes the activities: Post_Job_Ad, Screen_Candidates, Conduct_Interviews, Make_Hiring_Decision, Onboard_Employee, Add_to_Payroll, and Close_Case, with "Onboard_Employee" in a loop and "Add_to_Payroll" in an XOR (exclusive choice) structure. The order is: Post -> Screen, Post -> Interview, Interview -> Decide, Decide -> loop_onboarding, loop_onboarding -> xor_payroll, xor_payroll -> Close. This model allows for "Conduct_Interviews" to happen directly after "Post_Job_Ad", bypassing "Screen_Candidates", and includes a loop for onboarding and an optional payroll addition.

## Step 5: Identify anomalies in POWL Model 2
In POWL Model 2, "Post_Job_Ad" is directly followed by both "Screen_Candidates" and "Conduct_Interviews", which is unconventional because typically, screening happens before interviewing. The loop around "Onboard_Employee" allows for repeated onboarding, which could be seen as a deviation but might be justified in certain contexts (e.g., multiple onboarding steps or iterations based on performance). The XOR for "Add_to_Payroll" means it might be skipped, which is a significant deviation because adding a new employee to the payroll is a critical step.

## Step 6: Compare the models and decide which one is more normative
POWL Model 1 has an anomaly where "Conduct_Interviews" and "Make_Hiring_Decision" are not directly ordered, potentially allowing interviews after a hiring decision. POWL Model 2 has more significant deviations: "Conduct_Interviews" can happen before "Screen_Candidates", and "Add_to_Payroll" can be skipped. Both models have issues, but Model 1's issues are less severe in terms of process logic because it still generally follows a plausible hiring process sequence, albeit with some ambiguity.

## Step 7: Justify the choice
POWL Model 1 is closer to the normative Hire-to-Retire process because it generally follows the expected sequence of activities (posting a job, screening, interviewing, deciding, onboarding, payroll, and closing) more closely than Model 2. Although it has an anomaly regarding the order of "Conduct_Interviews" and "Make_Hiring_Decision", it does not skip critical steps like "Add_to_Payroll" or allow "Conduct_Interviews" before "Screen_Candidates".

The final answer is: $\boxed{POWL Model 1}$
