### Reasoning & Decisions

#### 1. **Event Matching & Merging**
- **Order Received (A) + OrderReceived (B)**  
  - Timestamps differ by **2 seconds** (A: `10:00:00Z`, B: `09:59:58Z`).  
  - Event names are equivalent (formatting difference).  
  - Merged into a single record. Log A’s timestamp (`10:00:00Z`) is used for ordering (primary timeline).

- **Order Validated (A) + OrderValidation (B)**  
  - Timestamps differ by **1 second** (A: `10:01:30Z`, B: `10:01:29Z`).  
  - Event names match semantically.  
  - Merged; Log A’s timestamp used for ordering.

- **Item Shipped (A) + Shipping (B)**  
  - Timestamps differ by **2 seconds** (A: `10:05:00Z`, B: `10:05:02Z`).  
  - Event names align logically (shipping completion).  
  - Merged; Log A’s timestamp used for ordering.

#### 2. **Unmerged Events**
- **Payment Processed (A)** vs. **PaymentCheck (B)**  
  - Timestamps differ by **5 seconds** (A: `10:02:00Z`, B: `10:02:05Z`), exceeding the 2-second tolerance.  
  - Event names suggest distinct phases (payment processing vs. payment verification).  
  - Left as separate events.

- **Quality Check (B)**  
  - No corresponding event in Log A.  
  - Included as-is with Log B’s timestamp.

- **Item Delivered (A)**  
  - No corresponding event in Log B.  
  - Included as-is with Log A’s timestamp.

#### 3. **Timestamp Handling**
- For merged events, both timestamps are retained, but **Log A’s timestamp** drives ordering (primary timeline).  
- Standalone events use their original timestamps.

#### 4. **Attribute Enrichment**
- Merged events include all attributes from both logs (e.g., `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes` from Log B).  
- Standalone events retain their source-specific attributes.
