Below is an illustrative approach to aggregating the low-level events into higher-level process steps, along with the rationale behind the groupings and proposed names.

### Proposed High-Level Activities

1. **Material Preparation**  
2. **Welding & Integrity Check**  
3. **Coating & Final Inspection**

### Grouping Logic & Justification

**Rationale for the Groupings:**

1. **Material Preparation:**  
   - **Events Included:**  
     - Retrieve raw metal sheet  
     - Scan barcode  
     - Place metal sheet on table  
     - Align metal sheet  
     - Preheat metal sheet  
     
   **Justification:**  
   These initial actions are all focused on getting the raw material ready for processing. They occur before any transformative operations (such as welding) and involve setting up the material correctly. The sequence is clearly preparatory: first bringing in the raw material, verifying it via scanning, properly positioning it, and then preparing its surface conditions (e.g., preheating).

2. **Welding & Integrity Check:**  
   - **Events Included:**  
     - Pick up welding tool  
     - Weld corner A  
     - Weld corner B  
     - Measure weld integrity  
     
   **Justification:**  
   Once the material is prepared, the process moves into assembly and joining operations. Picking up the welding tool and performing welds are clearly transformative steps. Immediately following welding, a weld integrity measurement is performed to ensure that the quality of the weld meets standards. Grouping these together makes sense because they represent a coherent "assembly and immediate quality verification" phase.  

3. **Coating & Final Inspection:**  
   - **Events Included:**  
     - Apply protective coating  
     - Dry coating  
     - Visual check  
     
   **Justification:**  
   After the welding and initial integrity check, the item undergoes finishing steps. Applying and drying a protective coating is a distinct phase that protects and finalizes the product’s surface. The final visual check confirms the overall quality before the product is considered complete. These steps naturally cluster into a finishing and final quality assurance phase.

### Conclusion

By grouping the low-level events into these three high-level steps—**Material Preparation**, **Welding & Integrity Check**, and **Coating & Final Inspection**—we create a clear, domain-relevant representation of the manufacturing process. This makes it much easier for analysts and stakeholders to comprehend the workflow at a glance and focus on key phases rather than sifting through numerous low-level events.
