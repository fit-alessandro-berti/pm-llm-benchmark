### Key Assumptions:
1. **Order 1004**: No delivery or invoice records exist, so only "Order Created" and "Item Picked" events are included.
2. **Resource/Actor**: For payments, no explicit resource is provided, so the field is left blank.
3. **Chronological Order**: Events are sorted by timestamp within each `order_id` to ensure correct sequencing.
4. **Activity Names**: Derived from table names and context (e.g., `item_picking_date`  "Item Picked").

This event log is ready for process mining analysis, with each row representing a distinct event in the order-to-cash process.
