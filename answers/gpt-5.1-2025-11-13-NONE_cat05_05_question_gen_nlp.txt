1. How does the company balance the trade-off between sourcing from the most cost-effective suppliers and ensuring resilience against geopolitical, climate, or pandemic-related disruptions in those regions?

2. In what ways could the company redesign its product (e.g., modular components, standardized parts) to reduce dependency on specific suppliers or single-source components?

3. How are lead-time variabilities from different international suppliers modeled, and what strategies are used to buffer against aggregated delays without inflating inventory costs?

4. What criteria determine whether a market is served via just-in-time replenishment versus aggregated monthly shipments, and how often are these criteria revisited?

5. How does the company monitor and manage supplier compliance with labor, environmental, and ethical standards across different regulatory environments?

6. What are the key bottlenecks in the end-to-end process (from R&D to after-sales support), and how are these identified, prioritized, and addressed?

7. How is demand uncertainty in each region incorporated into production and distribution planning, and what role do predictive analytics and machine learning actually play in decision-making?

8. How does the company measure and optimize the total landed cost of each smartphone model across different markets, including tariffs, logistics, insurance, and compliance costs?

9. What governance structures are in place to coordinate decisions between R&D, procurement, manufacturing, logistics, sales, and after-sales support so that local optimizations don’t harm global performance?

10. How does the company evaluate the trade-offs between air freight and ocean shipping in terms of cost, lead time, carbon footprint, and service level requirements?

11. In what ways does the company design and test contingency plans for major disruptions (e.g., a plant shutdown, port closure, sudden regulatory change) in different parts of the supply chain?

12. How are quality issues traced back through the global supply network, and what systems exist to quickly execute targeted recalls or corrective actions without over-recalling?

13. How does warranty and after-sales failure data feed back into supplier selection, quality standards, and R&D design choices?

14. What mechanisms exist to share data and forecasts with suppliers and logistics partners, and how does data-sharing affect trust, bargaining power, and performance?

15. How is the carbon footprint of each smartphone measured across its lifecycle, and what practical steps are being taken to reduce emissions without undermining service levels or profitability?

16. How does the company decide where to locate new assembly plants or distribution centers, and what factors (e.g., labor cost, risk, market proximity, trade agreements) weigh most heavily?

17. To what extent is the supply chain strategy differentiated by smartphone model (e.g., flagship vs budget lines), and how do these differences influence risk exposure and profitability?

18. How does the company manage currency risk across multiple countries and contracts, and how do exchange rate fluctuations impact pricing, sourcing, and inventory decisions?

19. What role do digital twins or end-to-end supply chain simulations play in testing alternative scenarios, such as different sourcing strategies, transport modes, or inventory policies?

20. How does the organization ensure that continuous improvement initiatives (e.g., lean projects, automation, process redesign) are aligned with long-term strategic goals rather than just short-term cost cutting?
