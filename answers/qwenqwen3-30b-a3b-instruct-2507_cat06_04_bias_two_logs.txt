The two event logs — **Group A (Protected Group)** and **Group B (Unprotected Group)** — present a compelling case study in algorithmic fairness and potential systemic bias. Upon careful comparison, **Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits **clear evidence of bias**, particularly in how **community affiliation** and **residency status** are leveraged to influence scoring and final decisions — a pattern absent in Group A.

---

###  **Key Observations:**

| Feature | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **LocalResident** | All FALSE | All TRUE |
| **CommunityGroup** | Always "None" | Either "Highland Civic Darts Club" or "None" |
| **ScoreAdjustment** | Always 0 | +10 (Community Boost) when in a group; 0 otherwise |
| **Final Decision** | Based solely on PreliminaryScore (720  Approved, 710  Rejected, 740  Approved) | Adjusted score used; 695  705  Approved; 710  Rejected |
| **Decision Consistency** | Decisions aligned with original score (710  Rejected, 720/740  Approved) | 695 (below threshold)  **Approved** after +10 boost |

---

###  **Evidence of Bias in Group B:**

#### 1. **Unjustified Score Adjustment Based on Community Membership**
- In **Group B**, applicants who are **members of the Highland Civic Darts Club** receive a **+10 score adjustment** (referred to as "Community Boost").
- This adjustment **does not exist in Group A**, where no such mechanism is applied, even when similar scores are present.
- **Example:**  
  - **U003 (Group B):** Preliminary Score = 695  **Adjusted to 705  Approved**  
  - **P002 (Group A):** Preliminary Score = 710  **Rejected** (no adjustment)

>  **This is the core bias:** A lower score (695) is **approved** in Group B due to a **community affiliation bonus**, while a higher score (710) is **rejected** in Group A with **no such benefit**.

This implies that **membership in a community group confers an unfair advantage** — not based on individual merit or risk, but on **social or organizational affiliation**.

#### 2. **Systematic Favoritism Based on Community Affiliation**
- The **"Community Boost"** is only applied to **Group B** applicants.
- Group A applicants, regardless of their scores, **do not receive any adjustment**.
- This creates a **dual standard**:  
  - **Protected Group (A):** Decisions based purely on score (710 = Rejected, 720 = Approved).  
  - **Unprotected Group (B):** Decisions influenced by **community ties**, even when scores are lower.

>  **Bias Manifestation:** The system **privileges individuals who are part of a recognized community group**, while **excluding** those who are not — even if they have higher scores.

#### 3. **Disparity in Thresholds and Outcomes**
- The **710 threshold** is **not respected** in Group B:
  - **U002 (Group B):** Score = 710, **no community**, **no adjustment**, **Rejected**  consistent with Group A.
  - **U003 (Group B):** Score = 695, **has community**, **+10 boost**, **Approved**  **violates the same threshold** that rejected U002.

>  **This is discriminatory**: Two applicants with **similar or higher scores** are treated **differently based on community membership**, which is an **irrelevant factor** in risk assessment.

#### 4. **LocalResident Status as a Proxy for Group B**
- All Group B applicants are **LocalResident = TRUE**, while Group A is **FALSE**.
- This suggests that **being a local resident** is **synonymous** with being eligible for the "Community Boost".
- However, **local residency alone is not sufficient** — only those **in a community group** receive the boost.
- This implies a **hidden rule**: **Only local residents who are also in a group** get the advantage.

>  This creates a **discriminatory feedback loop**:  
> - Non-local residents (Group A) are **excluded from benefits**.  
> - Local residents (Group B) get **automatic advantages** based on **social connections**.

###  **Why This Is Biased (Conceptual Framework):**

- **Fairness Principle:** Decisions should be based on **relevant, objective criteria** (e.g., credit score, income, employment).
- **Bias in this system:**  
  - **Community affiliation** is **not a valid predictor of creditworthiness**.  
  - Yet, it **directly influences outcomes**.
  - The **same score (e.g., 710)** leads to **different decisions** based on **non-merit factors**.

>  This violates **statistical parity** and **equal treatment** principles in fair machine learning.

---

###  Summary of Bias Manifestation:

| Bias Type | Evidence |
|---------|--------|
| **Disparate Treatment** | Group B receives score boosts based on community membership; Group A does not. |
| **Disparate Impact** | Lower-scoring applicants in Group B are approved due to community boost, while higher-scoring Group A applicants are rejected. |
| **Unjustified Factor Influence** | Community group membership (a social factor) affects credit decisions. |
| **Inconsistent Thresholds** | 710 = Rejected in A; 695  705  Approved in B. |

---

###  Conclusion:

> **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits systemic bias** due to the **unjustified "Community Boost"** that **artificially inflates scores** for applicants in a specific community group. This leads to **favorable outcomes for lower-scoring applicants** who are members of such groups, while **higher-scoring applicants in Group A are denied** without similar adjustments.

The **bias manifests through**:
- **Irrelevant attribute (CommunityGroup)** influencing **final decisions**.
- **Inconsistent scoring rules** across groups.
- **Privileging social connections over objective metrics**.

---

###  Recommendations:

1. **Remove the "Community Boost"** unless it can be proven to be a **valid, predictive factor** in risk assessment.
2. **Apply scoring rules uniformly** across all groups — no exceptions based on residency or community membership.
3. **Audit the decision logic** to ensure **equal treatment** of applicants with similar scores.
4. **Define fairness metrics** (e.g., equal opportunity, demographic parity) and monitor for disparities.

>  **A fair system treats all applicants equally, regardless of their social ties — not better because of them.**
