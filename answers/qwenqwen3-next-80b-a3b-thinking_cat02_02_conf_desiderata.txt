Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. So, there are two parts here: normative process behavior (strict rules) and desiderata (recommended but not strict). I need to check each case against these rules.

First, let's recall the normative constraints. The strict sequence is: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant. Then, if approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case; if rejected, no Finalize Documentation before closing.

Key things that are not allowed: skipping steps, reversing order (like Risk before Credit Check), finalizing documentation after rejection, or closing without following the decision logic.

Now looking at the event log:

Case 1:
- Application Received at 09:00
- Credit Check at 09:30 (after application)
- Risk Assessment at 10:00 (after Credit Check)
- Loan Decision (Approved) at 11:00
- Inform Applicant at 13:00 (after decision)
- Finalize Documentation at 13:30 (after decision, before Close Case)
- Close Case at 14:00

This seems to follow the sequence perfectly. No skips, correct order. Approved so Finalize before Close. So Case 1 is compliant with normative rules. No desiderata issues here? Well, the desiderata mention Credit Check within 24h (which it was, same day), Inform within 48h (13:00 is 2 hours after decision, which is fine). Also, no follow-up call, but that's just recommended, not required. So Case 1 is good.

Case 2:
- Application Received 08:00
- Risk Assessment at 08:20 (before Credit Check! That's a problem)
- Then Credit Check at 09:00 (after Risk Assessment, which violates the order)
- Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30
- Finalize Documentation at 10:00 (after rejection, which is not allowed)
- Close Case at 10:30

So here, multiple normative violations. First, Risk Assessment before Credit Check. That's a direct order violation. Then, Credit Check after Risk Assessment, which is reversed. Then, after rejection, they did Finalize Documentation, which is strictly prohibited. So Case 2 has several normative violations.

Case 3:
- Application Received 09:00
- Credit Check at 14th 10:00 (two days later, which is over 24h)
- Risk Assessment 11:00 same day
- Loan Decision (Approved) 12:00
- Inform Applicant 16th 15:00 (which is two days after decision, so over 48h)
- Finalize Documentation 17th 09:00
- Close Case 17th 10:00
- No Follow-up Call

For normative rules: Let's check sequence. Application  Credit Check (yes, after application), Risk after Credit Check, Decision after Risk, Inform after Decision. Then Approved, so Finalize before Close. So sequence-wise, it's okay. No skips or order issues. The Credit Check happened after 24h, but that's a desideratum, not a normative rule. Similarly, Inform Applicant took more than 48h, which is a desideratum violation. No follow-up call, which is also a desideratum. But normatively, the sequence is correct. So no normative violations here.

Wait, but in Case 3, is there any normative issue? Let's see:

- Application Received  Credit Check (yes, even though delayed, but sequence is correct)
- Credit Check  Risk Assessment (yes)
- Risk  Decision (yes)
- Decision  Inform (yes)
- Approved, so Finalize before Close (yes)

So normatively, it's okay. The delays are just desiderata issues.

So for part 1: Which cases violate normative rules?

Case 2 has multiple violations: Risk before Credit Check, Credit Check after Risk (but the order is reversed), Finalize after rejection. So yes.

Case 1: okay.

Case 3: okay on normative.

So only Case 2 violates normative rules.

For part 2: Desiderata violations.

Desiderata include:

- Credit Check within 24h after application received.

- Inform Applicant within 48h of loan decision.

- Follow-up call before closing (recommended but not required).

Case 1:

- Credit Check: 09:30 same day as application (09:00), so within 24h. Good.

- Inform Applicant: 13:00, decision at 11:00, so 2 hours later. Within 48h. Good.

- No follow-up call, but it's not required, so not a violation. Just optional.

Case 2:

- Credit Check: Application at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00. So 1 hour later. But wait, but in Case 2, the Credit Check happened after Risk Assessment, but the timing for Credit Check itself: 08:00 to 09:00 is within 24h. So that's okay for desiderata. But the main issue was the normative violation.

- Inform Applicant: Decision at 09:30, Inform at 10:00. Within 48h. So desiderata for timing is okay here.

- No follow-up call, but again optional.

Case 3:

- Credit Check: Application at 09:00 on 12th, Credit Check on 14th 10:00. That's 2 days later (48+ hours), so violates the 24h desideratum.

- Inform Applicant: Decision at 14th 12:00, Inform at 16th 15:00. So 2 days and 3 hours later. Which is over 48h. So violates the inform within 48h.

- No follow-up call. But since it's recommended but not required, it's a desideratum not met, but not a violation. However, the desiderata says "it is encouraged—but not strictly required—to perform a Follow-up Call", so not doing it is a desideratum failure but not a serious issue.

So for desiderata violations:

Case 3 has Credit Check over 24h, Inform over 48h, and no follow-up call.

Case 2: Credit Check within 24h, Inform within 48h, but no follow-up call. But since follow-up is optional, maybe only the timing for Credit Check and Inform in Case 3 are desiderata violations.

Wait, in Case 2, the Credit Check happened after Risk Assessment, but the timing of Credit Check itself: 08:00 to 09:00 is within 24h. So yes, but the problem is the sequence, not the timing. So for desiderata, the timing of Credit Check is okay, even though the order was wrong. But desiderata is about timing, regardless of order. So for desiderata, the Credit Check time is within 24h, so okay. Similarly, Inform within 48h.

So Case 2's desiderata are okay. Only Case 3 has desiderata issues.

Wait, but in Case 3, Credit Check is 2 days later, which violates the recommended 24h. Inform is 2 days after decision, which violates the 48h recommendation. And no follow-up call.

So for part 2: Case 3 violates desiderata (Credit Check timing, Inform timing, and missing follow-up call). Case 1 meets all desiderata (assuming follow-up call isn't required). Case 2's timing for Credit Check and Inform are okay, so no desiderata violations there. But follow-up call not done, but it's optional.

So the answer would be:

Part 1: Only Case 2 violates normative rules. Because:

- Risk Assessment before Credit Check (order violation)

- Credit Check after Risk Assessment (reversed order)

- Finalize Documentation after rejection (not allowed)

Part 2: Case 3 violates desiderata because:

- Credit Check took more than 24h (2 days)

- Inform Applicant took more than 48h (2 days after decision)

- No Follow-up Call (though optional, but still a desideratum not met)

Case 1: No desiderata issues. Case 2: No desiderata issues (timing okay, no follow-up is optional).

Wait, but in Case 2, the Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment, but the timing between application and Credit Check was 1 hour, which is within 24h. So even though the order was wrong, the timing for desiderata is okay. So yes, for desiderata, the timing is separate from the sequence. So Case 2's timing for Credit Check is okay, but the sequence violation is a normative issue.

So yes, only Case 3 has desiderata issues.

Now, for the suggestions or justifications.

For Case 2: The sequence is messed up. Maybe someone thought that Risk Assessment could be done before Credit Check, but that's against the rules. Also, finalizing documentation after rejection is a big mistake. Maybe the system didn't check the loan decision before finalizing, but that's a process error. They should not finalize after rejection.

For Case 3: The delays in Credit Check and Inform might be due to workload or other reasons. Maybe the credit check team was busy, or the inform step was delayed for administrative reasons. But the process could be improved by speeding up those steps. The missing follow-up call could be because it's not mandatory, but it's recommended for customer satisfaction.

Case 1 is perfect.

Let me check again.

Case 2:

- Application Received 08:00

- Risk Assessment 08:20 (no Credit Check before that, which violates the rule)

- Then Credit Check at 09:00 (after Risk Assessment)

- Loan Decision Rejected at 09:30

- Then Finalize Documentation (which is not allowed after rejection)

So yes, multiple normative violations.

Case 3:

- Credit Check at 14th 10:00, which is two days after application (12th 09:00). So 48+ hours. So violates the "within 24h" desideratum.

- Inform Applicant on 16th 15:00. Decision was on 14th 12:00. So 2 days and 3 hours later. Which is more than 48 hours (48h is 2 days), so yes, violates the 48h desideratum.

- No follow-up call. Since it's recommended but not required, it's a desideratum not met.

So yes.

So to answer:

Part 1: Case 2 violates normative rules. Reasons: Risk Assessment before Credit Check, Credit Check after Risk Assessment (order reversed), Finalize Documentation after rejection.

Part 2: Case 3 violates desiderata (Credit Check >24h, Inform >48h, no follow-up call). Case 1 and 2 don't have desiderata violations (though Case 2 has normative issues, but desiderata timing is okay).

Wait, but in Case 2, the Credit Check happened within 24h (1 hour after application), so desideratum for Credit Check timing is okay. Inform happened within 30 minutes of decision, so within 48h. So yes, no desiderata issues for Case 2.

So only Case 3 has desiderata issues.

Now, for the suggestions:

For Case 2: The process steps were out of order. Maybe the Risk Assessment was done prematurely, perhaps due to a system error or human mistake. They shouldn't have done Risk before Credit Check. Also, after rejection, they shouldn't finalize documentation. This might be a case of not checking the decision before proceeding. Need to enforce the sequence strictly.

For Case 3: The delays in Credit Check and Inform might be due to high workload or resource constraints. To meet desiderata, maybe prioritize credit checks within 24h and inform applicants within 48h. Also, adding a follow-up call could improve customer satisfaction, though it's optional.

Case 1 is perfect, so no issues.

### **Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Rules and Desiderata**

---

#### **Part 1: Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules) Violations**  
**Only Case 2 violates normative rules.**  
**Reasons:**  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**:  
  - Activity sequence: `Application Received (08:00)  Risk Assessment (08:20)  Credit Check (09:00)`.  
  - **Violation**: Credit Check **must** occur before Risk Assessment. This is a direct sequence violation (Rule: *Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment*).  
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**:  
  - Loan Decision was **Rejected** (09:30), but `Finalize Documentation` was performed at **10:00**.  
  - **Violation**: Finalizing documentation after rejection is explicitly prohibited (Rule: *If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case*).  

**Why Case 1 and Case 3 are compliant with normative rules:**  
- **Case 1**:  
  - Perfect sequence: `Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`.  
  - All ordering rules are satisfied (e.g., Risk Assessment after Credit Check, Finalize Documentation before Close Case for approval).  
- **Case 3**:  
  - Sequence is correct: `Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`.  
  - No skipped steps, reversed order, or Finalize Documentation after rejection (loan was approved).  
  - *Note: Delays in Credit Check/Inform timing are **desiderata violations**, not normative rule breaches.*  

---

#### **Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict) Violations**  
**Only Case 3 violates desiderata conditions.**  
**Reasons:**  
- **Credit Check >24 hours after Application Received**:  
  - Application Received: **2024-01-12 09:00**  
  - Credit Check: **2024-01-14 10:00** (49 hours later).  
  - **Violation**: Desideratum requires Credit Check within **24 hours** of application.  
- **Inform Applicant >48 hours after Loan Decision**:  
  - Loan Decision: **2024-01-14 12:00**  
  - Inform Applicant: **2024-01-16 15:00** (51 hours later).  
  - **Violation**: Desideratum recommends Informing Applicant within **48 hours** of decision.  
- **No Follow-up Call**:  
  - Desideratum encourages a Follow-up Call before closing the case, but it is **not mandatory**. While the absence is suboptimal, it is not a "serious violation."  

**Why Case 1 and Case 2 do not violate desiderata:**  
- **Case 1**:  
  - Credit Check (09:30) occurred **30 minutes** after Application (09:00)  **within 24 hours**.  
  - Inform Applicant (13:00) occurred **2 hours** after Loan Decision (11:00)  **within 48 hours**.  
  - No Follow-up Call (optional, so not a violation).  
- **Case 2**:  
  - Credit Check (09:00) occurred **1 hour** after Application (08:00)  **within 24 hours**.  
  - Inform Applicant (10:00) occurred **30 minutes** after Loan Decision (09:30)  **within 48 hours**.  
  - No Follow-up Call (optional, so not a violation).  

> **Clarification on Desiderata**:  
> - Violating desiderata is **not a process failure** but indicates **suboptimal performance** (e.g., delays may harm customer experience or efficiency).  
> - The absence of a Follow-up Call is **never a violation** (it is purely recommended).  

---

#### **Suggestions for Justifications/Improvements**  
- **Case 2 (Normative Violations)**:  
  - **Likely cause**: Human error or system misconfiguration (e.g., Risk Assessment triggered prematurely due to a workflow bug).  
  - **Recommendation**: Implement automated checks to block Risk Assessment until Credit Check is completed. Add validation to prevent Finalize Documentation after rejection (e.g., system flagging "Rejected" decisions to skip documentation).  
  - **Justification**: These steps are critical to compliance; deviations risk regulatory penalties or incorrect decisions (e.g., finalizing documentation for a rejected loan could create legal liabilities).  

- **Case 3 (Desiderata Violations)**:  
  - **Likely cause**: Resource constraints (e.g., credit team backlog) or manual processing delays.  
  - **Recommendation**:  
    - Prioritize Credit Checks for new applications to meet the 24-hour target (e.g., allocate dedicated staff for high-priority cases).  
    - Automate the "Inform Applicant" step to trigger immediately after Loan Decision (e.g., email/SMS notifications).  
    - Consider adding a Follow-up Call as a **standard practice** (even if optional) to improve customer trust and reduce disputes.  
  - **Justification**: While not strictly required, meeting desiderata improves operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Delays in Credit Check/Inform can lead to applicant frustration or lost business.  

- **Case 1**:  
  - **No action needed** – this is an ideal process execution. Maintain current workflows.

### **Summary of Findings**  
| Case | Normative Violations | Desiderata Violations |  
|------|----------------------|------------------------|  
| **1** | None | None |  
| **2** |  Risk before Credit Check<br> Finalize Documentation after rejection | None |  
| **3** | None |  Credit Check >24h<br> Inform Applicant >48h<br> No Follow-up Call (optional, not a violation) |  

> **Key Takeaway**:  
> - **Normative rules are non-negotiable** – violations must be fixed immediately to avoid compliance risks.  
> - **Desiderata are improvement opportunities** – addressing them enhances efficiency and customer experience but does not invalidate the process.
