The graphic is a BPMN (Business Process Model & Notation) diagram that depicts how a manufacturing company handles a customer order from the moment it is received until the product is shipped and invoiced.  
The process is arranged in one pool (the company) that is divided into four horizontal lanes, each representing an organizational area: Sales, Production, Procurement and Warehouse. Solid arrows indicate normal sequence flow inside a lane; dashed arrows show inter-lane message flow; gateways (diamonds) show decisions; circles show start or end events; icons inside circles/activities give extra meaning (message, timer, compensation, error, database, etc.).

1. Sales lane (top)  
   • Start event: “Monday morning”.  
   • Task: Check order for completeness.  
   • Exclusive gateway: Is the customer already in the database?  
     – No: Add customer to the database (task with a data-store icon).  
     – Yes: skip directly forward.  
     – The two branches re-join at the following gateway.  
   • Task: Send order details (throws a message to Production & Procurement).  
   • Intermediate message catch: waits for “Product sent” from Warehouse.  
   • Task: Draft invoice.  
   • End event.

2. Production lane  
   • Start message catch event: “Order details arrive”.  
   • Task: Plan production.  
   • Gateway: material quality check.  
   • Intermediate conditional event: “Material not faulty”.  
   • Task: Manufacture product.  
   • End event: “Product complete”.   
   • Message is sent to the Warehouse (“Product complete”) and, after the Warehouse ships, another dashed line goes back to Sales.

3. Procurement lane  
   • Start message catch event: “Order details arrive”.  
   • Embedded subprocess called “Material Compensation Subprocess”:  
       – Start.  
       – Task: Order materials.  
       – A compensation task (“Return material”) can be triggered if necessary.  
       – End.  
   • Task: Check materials (also has a looping arrow indicating it may repeat).  
   • Exclusive gateway can lead to an intermediate error event “Order cancellation”, then to an end event if materials fail inspection.

4. Warehouse lane  
   • Start message catch event: triggered by “Product complete” coming from Production.  
   • Task: Send product.  
   • End message throw event: “Product sent” (goes to Sales).

Overall flow  
• Sales initiates and coordinates the overall process.  
• Production and Procurement work in parallel once order details arrive.  
• Production cannot build the product until Procurement supplies fault-free materials.  
• When Production finishes, Warehouse ships the product, notifying Sales.  
• After confirmation of shipment, Sales drafts the invoice and the process ends.

The diagram clarifies responsibility splits, inter-department communication and the decision points (e.g., new customer, faulty material, order cancellation).
