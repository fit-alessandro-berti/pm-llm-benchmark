The pseudo-BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) representation describes a business process that handles customer requests, including both standard and custom requests. Below is a detailed explanation of the underlying business process, the meaning of each step, the gateways, and the paths and conditions.

---

### **1. Start Event**
- **Purpose**: This is the initial point of the process, where the business starts the flow of tasks.
- **Context**: It represents the beginning of the process where a customer’s request is received.

### **2. Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose**: The first task is to receive the customer’s request.
- **Context**: It’s where the system or employee records the customer’s request, which will later be processed.

### **3. Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**
- **Purpose**: This gateway determines which path to take based on the type of request.
- **Context**: The process needs to distinguish between two types of requests – **Standard** and **Custom**.
  - **XOR (Exclusive OR)**: Only one path will be followed, either Standard or Custom, based on the condition being true.

### **4. Standard Request Path:**
#### **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
- **Purpose**: Validating the standard request.
- **Context**: This could involve basic checks such as confirming the completeness of the request, checking for any obvious errors, or validating the customer’s data.
  
#### **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
- **Purpose**: This is a parallel gateway that runs multiple tasks at the same time.
- **Context**: Two checks need to be conducted concurrently:
  - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**: This checks the customer's creditworthiness to ensure they can pay for the service or product.
  - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**: Verifies if the requested product or service is available in inventory.

#### **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
- **Purpose**: This step indicates that both parallel tasks have been completed, and the process can now move forward.
- **Context**: The process continues only after the completion of both the credit and inventory checks.

#### **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
- **Purpose**: Once the validation is done, the next step is to calculate when the product or service can be delivered to the customer.
- **Context**: Factors like availability, shipping time, and other logistical elements would determine the delivery date.

### **5. Custom Request Path:**
#### **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
- **Purpose**: This step involves assessing whether the customer's custom request is feasible.
- **Context**: A custom request could involve modifications, additional features, or other unique specifications, so a feasibility check is required.

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
- **Purpose**: This gateway decides whether the customization can proceed based on the feasibility analysis.
- **Context**: It checks if the custom request can be fulfilled. The process has two possible outcomes:
  - **Yes**: Customization is feasible, so the process moves to prepare a custom quotation.
  - **No**: Customization isn’t feasible, triggering a rejection notice to be sent to the customer.

#### **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
- **Purpose**: When customization is feasible, a quotation is prepared to communicate the cost and terms of the custom request.
- **Context**: This task prepares the necessary pricing and details for the customized service/product.

#### **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
- **Purpose**: If the customization isn’t feasible, a rejection notice is sent to inform the customer.
- **Context**: This task ensures that the customer is promptly informed about the inability to fulfill their request.

### **6. Approval Path:**
#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
- **Purpose**: This gateway checks whether manager approval is required after the request is validated (for both Standard and Custom paths).
- **Context**: Some requests may need further oversight or approval (e.g., large orders, special terms, or customized offers).
  - **XOR (Exclusive OR)**: Based on this gateway, either approval is required, or the process continues directly to invoicing.

#### **If Approval is Needed:**
- **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
  - **Purpose**: If approval is necessary, a manager must review and approve the request.
  - **Context**: The manager may need to review conditions like pricing, special terms, or any exceptions before proceeding.

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
- **Purpose**: This checks whether the manager has granted approval.
- **Context**: The process splits based on whether the manager approves the request or not:
  - **Yes**: Approval is granted, and the process moves on to the next step of generating the invoice.
  - **No**: If the approval is denied, the process enters a re-evaluation phase.

#### **If Approval is Denied:**
- **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
  - **Purpose**: This task allows the business to reconsider the terms or conditions, possibly adjusting the request.
  - **Context**: If approval is not granted, adjustments to the request might be needed, which could involve changing conditions like pricing, delivery, or customizations.

#### **Loop Back:**
- **Purpose**: The process loops back either to the preparation of a custom quotation (for Custom requests) or to calculating the delivery date (for Standard requests), depending on where the re-evaluation is needed.
- **Context**: This looping allows the process to refine conditions before proceeding further.

#### **If No Approval is Needed:**
- **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
  - **Purpose**: If no approval is needed, the process proceeds directly to generating the final invoice for the customer.
  - **Context**: The final invoice is prepared and ready to be sent to the customer.

---

### **7. Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- **Purpose**: After the invoice is generated (or after a rejection notice is sent), the process concludes by confirming with the customer.
- **Context**: This is the final step where the customer is informed about the status of their request, either confirming their order or notifying them of rejection.

### **End Event**
- **Purpose**: Marks the end of the business process.
- **Context**: After all necessary actions (invoicing or rejection notice) and communications are completed, the process concludes.

---

### **Summary of Key Points:**

- **Standard vs. Custom Requests**: The primary distinction in the process is based on the request type. Standard requests go through validation and checks, while custom requests require a feasibility analysis and may involve more complex rework.
  
- **Gateways**: The XOR gateways are used for decision-making, ensuring only one path is followed based on the conditions. The AND gateway is used for parallel processing of tasks that can be done simultaneously.
  
- **Approval Process**: Whether approval is needed depends on the request type and other business conditions. If approval is required, the process diverges, and rework or re-evaluation may be needed if approval is not granted.

- **Looping**: The process includes loops for re-evaluating conditions when approval is denied, ensuring the business can adjust and resubmit requests without starting over completely.
