# Analysis of Process Deviations

## Summary of Violations

**Compliant Cases:** Case 1, Case 4

**Non-Compliant Cases:** Case 2, Case 3, Case 5

## Detailed Analysis by Case

### **Case 1: COMPLIANT **
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

**Analysis:** This case follows the ideal normative flow perfectly. It represents the "sufficient inventory" scenario where:
- Inventory is checked immediately after receiving the order
- Payment is authorized only after confirming inventory
- Items are packaged after payment authorization
- Order is shipped only after packaging
- Order is properly closed as the final step

---

### **Case 2: NON-COMPLIANT **
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items**  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **Package items occurs before Authorize payment** - This directly violates the stated rule: "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped."
2. **Payment authorization sequencing violation** - The normative description explicitly states: "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known."

**Explanation:** By packaging items before obtaining payment authorization, this case creates a risky situation where resources are committed (items packaged) before financial approval is secured. This violates the logical dependency chain: Check  Authorize  Package  Ship.

---

### **Case 3: NON-COMPLIANT **
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **Shipping after cancellation** - This is explicitly prohibited: "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation."
2. **Incompatible activities in same process** - The case contains both "Authorize payment" and "Cancel order," which represent mutually exclusive process branches. If inventory is sufficient (leading to payment authorization), cancellation shouldn't occur. If inventory is insufficient (leading to cancellation), payment shouldn't be authorized.
3. **Shipping without packaging** - The normative flow requires "Package items" to occur before "Ship order," but this case ships without any packaging activity recorded.
4. **Illogical post-cancellation fulfillment** - The description states: "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)."

**Explanation:** This case represents a severely corrupted process where an order is simultaneously treated as both fulfillable (payment authorized) and unfulfillable (canceled), then improperly shipped after cancellation.

---

### **Case 4: COMPLIANT **
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

**Analysis:** This case correctly follows the "insufficient inventory" scenario:
- Order is received
- Inventory is checked
- Order is appropriately canceled (indicating insufficient inventory)
- Order is closed without any fulfillment activities

This matches the described cancellation path: "Receive, Check, Cancel, Close—for insufficient inventory scenarios."

---

### **Case 5: NON-COMPLIANT **
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **Missing "Package items" activity** - The normative description requires packaging before shipping: "Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with Ship order."
2. **Direct shipping after payment authorization** - This violates the mandatory sequence: "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping."

**Explanation:** While the sequence Check  Authorize  Ship appears partially correct, the critical "Package items" step is entirely omitted. The process cannot logically ship items that haven't been packaged. This represents either a process execution failure or incomplete logging, but in either case constitutes a deviation from the normative model.

## Summary of Key Process Rules and Their Violations

| Rule | Violated By |
|------|-------------|
| Authorize payment must occur before Package items | Case 2 |
| Package items must occur before Ship order | Case 3, Case 5 |
| Ship order must never occur after Cancel order | Case 3 |
| Fulfillment activities incompatible with cancellation | Case 3 |
| Package items must be present in fulfillment flow | Case 5 |

**Compliance Rate:** 2 out of 5 cases (40%) follow the normative process correctly.
