Based on the provided normative process description and the event log, here are the identified violations:

**Case 1:** This case follows the intended process flow correctly without any deviations from the normative description. 

**Case 2:**
- Violation: "Authorize payment" occurred after "Package items." According to the normative description, "Authorize payment" should occur before "Package items," as payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known and after checking inventory. 

**Case 3:**
- Violation 1: After determining insufficient inventory, the order was canceled, but then "Ship order" activity followed. This directly contradicts the normative process, which states that if inventory is insufficient, the correct sequence should be "Receive, Check, Cancel, Close." Shipping an order after cancellation is illogical and violates the intended process flow.
- Violation 2: The "Close order" activity precedes the "Cancel order" activity in this case. Normatively, once an order is canceled, "Close order" should follow immediately to finalize that specific path of the process. Here, it appears before, disrupting the logical sequence. 

**Case 4:** This case also violates the normative process:
- Violation: The order was canceled without a preceding inventory check. According to the normative description, when inventory is not sufficient, the correct sequence is "Receive, Check (inventory), Cancel." Here, the "Check inventory" activity occurred but was followed immediately by cancellation without confirming insufficient stock, which might indicate an oversight or misinterpretation of the process.

**Case 5:** This case adheres to the normative process flow accurately and does not present any violations. 

In summary, Cases 2, 3, and 4 violate aspects of the normative process as described, primarily concerning the sequence of "Authorize payment," "Package items" in sufficient inventory scenarios, and improper sequencing around order cancellations. These interpretations are based on a literal reading of the provided textual description, acknowledging potential room for flexible interpretation where specified.
