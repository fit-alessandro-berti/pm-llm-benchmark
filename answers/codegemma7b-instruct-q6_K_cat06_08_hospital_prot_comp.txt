## Main differences between the two process variants:

**Frequency:**

* The unprotected group has a significantly higher frequency of each activity compared to the process variants. This indicates a potentially higher volume of patients or processes handled in the unprotected group.
* The protected group has a higher frequency of Discharge compared to the unprotected group. This suggests that a larger proportion of patients in the protected group are being discharged directly after their treatment.
* The unprotected group has a higher frequency of both Expert Examination and Thorough Examination compared to the protected group. This implies a potentially more complex diagnostic and treatment process in the unprotected group.

**Performance:**

* The unprotected group has a lower average performance for almost every activity. This could be due to factors such as:
    * Less experienced medical staff in the unprotected group.
    * Lack of standardization in the process in the unprotected group.
    * Longer wait times for patients in the unprotected group.

**Process variant differences:**

* The process variants within the protected group seem to be more standardized and efficient compared to the process variants within the unprotected group.
* The process variants within the protected group seem to have more options for handling situations where the initial treatment is unsuccessful. This could be due to a higher level of expertise or experience in the protected group.

**Overall:**

* The unprotected group appears to be less efficient and less standardized than the protected group.
* The protected group appears to be more effective in discharging patients after receiving treatment.

**Possible explanations for the differences:**

* The differences could be due to a variety of factors, including:
    * Organizational culture and leadership.
    * Training and development programs for staff.
    * Availability of resources.
    * Patient characteristics.

**Further analysis:**

* It would be helpful to analyze the data further to see if there are any correlations between the differences in process variants and other factors, such as patient characteristics or organizational characteristics.
* It would also be helpful to compare the process variants to a third group of processes that are considered to be "best practices." This would provide a reference point for improvement and could help to identify areas where the protected group is exceeding expectations.
