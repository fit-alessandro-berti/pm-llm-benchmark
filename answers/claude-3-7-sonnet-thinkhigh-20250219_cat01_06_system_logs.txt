## Explanation of Event Log Transformation

### Case Identification Logic
After analyzing the system log, I identified two distinct business processes:

1. **Quarterly Report Preparation (QR_PREPARATION)**: This case represents the main workflow where the user works on multiple documents as part of creating a quarterly report. It includes interactions with four different documents:
   - Working on the main Quarterly_Report.docx
   - Creating and editing a supporting Document1.docx
   - Reviewing a reference document (Report_Draft.pdf)
   - Updating budget data (Budget_2024.xlsx)
   
2. **Meeting Communication (MEETING_COMM)**: This represents a separate email communication process related to an Annual Meeting that temporarily interrupts the main reporting work.

### Activity Naming Strategy
I standardized the raw system actions into meaningful business activities by:

1. Transforming low-level actions (FOCUS, TYPING, SWITCH, etc.) into descriptive activities that represent the business context:
   - FOCUS  "Access Document" or "Return To Document"
   - TYPING  "Draft Introduction", "Update Q1 Figures", etc.
   - SAVE  "Save Document" or "Save Budget Spreadsheet"
   - SWITCH  "Open Email Inbox" or "Review Reference Document"
   - CLICK  "Read Meeting Email", "Send Reply", etc.
   - SCROLL  "Review Content" or "Scroll Through Reference"
   - HIGHLIGHT  "Highlight Key Findings"
   - CLOSE  "Close Document"

2. Incorporating document context into activity names to make them more meaningful for process analysis.

### Event Log Structure
Each event includes:
- **Case ID**: Identifies the business process the event belongs to
- **Activity Name**: A standardized business-level description of the user action
- **Timestamp**: The original event timestamp
- **Application**: The software application being used
- **Document**: The specific document being worked on

This structure provides a clear view of how the user navigates between different documents and applications during their work processes, which will be valuable for process mining analysis and discovering operational patterns.
