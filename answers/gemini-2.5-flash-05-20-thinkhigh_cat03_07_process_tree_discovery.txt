Based on the provided event log and the definitions of process tree operators, the discovered process can be modeled as follows:

```
-> (
    'Receive Application (RA)',
    -> (
        'Validate Form (VF)',
        -> (
            'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
            -> (
                X (  # Exclusive choice: either skip the rework or enter the rework loop
                    'tau',  # Option 1: Skip the rework process (silent step)
                    * (     # Option 2: Execute the rework process (1 or more times)
                        -> (    # Sequence: RMI (1+ times) then VF
                            * (     # Loop for 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' (1 or more times)
                                'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
                                'tau'   # Loop continue: silent step (allows RMI to repeat)
                            ),
                            'Validate Form (VF)' # Activity after RMI loop
                        ),
                        'tau'   # Loop continue: silent step (allows the RMI-VF block to repeat)
                    )
                ),
                -> (
                    'Approval Decision (AD)',
                    -> (
                        'Send Confirmation (SC)',
                        'Archive Case (AC)'
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation of the Process Tree Structure:**

1.  **Overall Sequence (`->`):** The entire process follows a strict sequence from start to finish.
    *   `'Receive Application (RA)'`
    *   `'Validate Form (VF)'` (initial validation)
    *   `'Assess Eligibility (AE)'`
    *   **Rework/Skip Decision (`X`):** After assessing eligibility, there's an exclusive choice:
        *   **`'tau'`**: Represents the path where no further information is requested, and the process proceeds directly to the approval decision. This covers cases like Case 2 (`RA -> VF -> AE -> AD ...`).
        *   **Rework Loop (`*`):** This branch represents the scenario where missing information needs to be requested and re-validation occurs.
            *   **Inner Loop Body (`->`):** This sequence defines one iteration of the rework process:
                *   **`* ('Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'tau')`**: This sub-loop models the `RMI` activity being executed one or more times. `RMI` is the activity executed, and `tau` allows it to repeat.
                *   **`'Validate Form (VF)'`**: After the `RMI` requests (potentially multiple), a `VF` activity occurs for re-validation.
            *   **Outer Loop Repetition (`* (..., 'tau')`):** The entire `(RMI (1+ times) -> VF)` block can be repeated one or more times. The `tau` as the second argument to the outer loop operator allows for these repetitions. This covers cases like Case 1 (`... -> RMI -> VF -> AD ...`) and Case 3 (`... -> RMI -> RMI -> VF -> AD ...`).
    *   `'Approval Decision (AD)'`
    *   `'Send Confirmation (SC)'`
    *   `'Archive Case (AC)'`

This model accurately captures the main sequential flow, the optionality of the rework process, and the potential for multiple `Request Missing Info` activities within a single rework cycle, followed by a `Validate Form` activity, which itself can be repeated.
