Here’s a clear walkthrough of the business process represented by the pseudo-BPMN, explaining each step’s purpose, the gateway logic, how paths branch, join, and loop, and how the flow differs for standard vs. custom requests.

1) Start and Intake
- Start Event: Marks the beginning when a customer request is received.
- Task A: Receive Customer Request
  Purpose: Capture the customer’s request details (requirements, product/service, quantities, timelines, customization needs, etc.). This task ensures all necessary information is collected to classify and process the request.

2) Classify the Request (XOR Gateway: Check Request Type)
- Meaning: An exclusive decision is made to determine whether the request is Standard or Custom. Only one path is taken.
  - Standard Path: For off-the-shelf or predefined offerings.
  - Custom Path: For tailored solutions that require feasibility assessment.

3) Standard Path
- Task B1: Perform Standard Validation
  Purpose: Validate the request against predefined rules (e.g., product availability categories, pricing rules, basic eligibility, required customer data completeness). Goal is to ensure the request is clean before deeper checks.
- AND Gateway: Run Parallel Checks
  Meaning: Two checks run in parallel to speed up processing. Both must complete before proceeding.
  - Task C1: Credit Check
    Purpose: Assess customer’s creditworthiness (limit availability, risk flags, payment terms).
  - Task C2: Inventory Check
    Purpose: Confirm stock availability or lead times for items requested.
- Parallel Join (implicit after C1 and C2)
  Meaning: Waits for both checks to finish. The process continues only after both are completed.
- Task D: Calculate Delivery Date
  Purpose: Using inventory and credit results (and possibly logistics calendars), calculate a reliable delivery date or lead time for the standard request.

4) Custom Path
- Task B2: Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis
  Purpose: Technical and operational assessment: can the organization meet the custom requirements? Review capability, capacity, engineering constraints, cost implications, supplier dependencies, and timeline feasibility.
- XOR Gateway: Is Customization Feasible?
  Meaning: Exclusive decision based on the feasibility analysis.
  - If Yes  Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation
    Purpose: Build a tailored quote including scope, design/engineering effort, costs, timelines, risks, and terms.
  - If No  Task E2: Send Rejection Notice  End
    Purpose: Notify the customer that the customization cannot be delivered, ending the process for this request.

5) Post-Path Convergence and Approval Logic
- After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed
  Meaning: The flow from Standard (after Task D) and Custom (after Task E1) converges into a common decision on approvals. This is a logical merge: whichever path reaches this point continues forward.
- XOR Gateway: Is Approval Needed?
  Meaning: Decide if managerial approval is required before finalizing. Criteria could include:
  - High-value orders beyond a threshold
  - Discount levels exceeding policy
  - Special terms or risks flagged by credit or feasibility
  - Non-standard lead times or exceptional conditions
  Paths:
  - If No Approval Needed  Task G: Generate Final Invoice
    Purpose: Proceed directly to invoicing based on the chosen path’s result (for standard: price and delivery date; for custom: approved quotation terms).
  - If Yes  Task F: Obtain Manager Approval
    Purpose: Route the case to a manager for review and decision.

6) Approval Decision (XOR Gateway: Is Approval Granted?)
- Meaning: Exclusive decision after manager review.
  - If Yes  Task G: Generate Final Invoice
    Purpose: Create the final invoice/contract reflecting the approved terms.
  - If No  Task H: Re-evaluate Conditions
    Purpose: Trigger rework to address reasons for rejection (e.g., adjust price, delivery, scope, or terms).
    Loop behavior:
    - For Custom Path: Loop back to Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation)
      Rationale: The custom quote is revised based on manager feedback (e.g., price changes, scope adjustments).
    - For Standard Path: Loop back to Task D (Calculate Delivery Date)
      Rationale: Standard terms typically revolve around dates, inventory constraints, or pricing within policy; recalculating delivery or revisiting standard parameters can resolve the issue. In practice, this may also involve adjusting price or quantity within standard rules.

7) Finalization and Communication
- Task G: Generate Final Invoice
  Purpose: Formalize the offer/contract with final pricing, terms, and delivery commitments. This is the commercial document that can be sent to the customer or used to trigger order fulfillment.
- Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer
  Purpose: Communicate the final outcome—invoice and confirmation details (delivery date for standard; custom quotation terms confirmed)—and next steps (payment, shipment, onboarding).
- End Event: Process completes after customer confirmation is sent.

Key Differences: Standard vs. Custom
- Standard:
  - Validation uses predefined rules (Task B1).
  - Parallel operational checks for credit and inventory (C1/C2) are mandated.
  - Delivery date calculation (Task D) is central.
  - Rework on approval rejection loops to Task D to adjust standard parameters.
- Custom:
  - Requires feasibility analysis (Task B2) with possible termination if not feasible (E2).
  - If feasible, prepares a custom quotation (E1).
  - Rework on approval rejection loops to Task E1 to revise the custom quote.

Gateways Summary
- XOR (exclusive) “Check Request Type”: Chooses Standard vs. Custom; only one path continues.
- AND “Run Parallel Checks”: Forks into Credit and Inventory checks simultaneously; both must complete.
- XOR “Is Customization Feasible?”: For custom requests only; may end the process if not feasible.
- XOR “Is Approval Needed?”: Determines whether manager approval is required based on business rules.
- XOR “Is Approval Granted?”: Approver’s decision; either proceed to invoicing or loop back for rework.

Convergence and Loops
- Convergence after Standard or Custom path: Both paths feed into the approval-needed decision. This is a simple merge (not a synchronization), since only one of the paths will be active for a given request.
- Parallel join: After Credit and Inventory checks, both must complete before delivery date is calculated.
- Loop-backs on approval rejection:
  - Custom: back to Prepare Custom Quotation (E1).
  - Standard: back to Calculate Delivery Date (D).
  These loops allow iterative refinement until approval is granted or the request is withdrawn externally.

Conditions Triggering Approvals or Rework
- Approval needed when any policy threshold or special condition is met (e.g., high order value, exceptional discounts, negative credit indicators overridden, unusual delivery commitments, or risk flags).
- Rework is triggered when approval is denied, requiring adjustments to quote (custom) or delivery/terms (standard) to meet policy or management directives.
