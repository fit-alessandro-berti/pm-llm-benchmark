Let's analyze the events step by step to infer the case groupings. Each case should represent a distinct patient journey. We can use the combination of `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, and the logical sequence of activities to group the events.

### Observations:
1. There are three distinct patients based on age and gender:
   - Patient 1: age 45, gender M (events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15)
   - Patient 2: age 62, gender F (events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17)
   - Patient 3: age 28, gender M (events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18)

2. The departments also help confirm the grouping:
   - Patient 45M is primarily in ER (with a visit to Radiology for X-ray).
   - Patient 62F is entirely in ER (with Lab test in Laboratory).
   - Patient 28M is primarily in Surgery (with some activities in ER? Actually, event 3 is registered in Surgery, and all subsequent activities are in Surgery or related departments like Radiology? Wait, no Radiology for 28M; but note event 6 is Doctor consultation in Surgery, event 9 Surgery preparation in Surgery, event 13 Surgery performed in Surgery, event 16 Recovery room in Surgery, event 18 discharged from Surgery).

3. The activities form logical sequences for each patient.

Let's list the events for each case:

### Case 1 (Patient 45, M, ER patient with fracture):
- Event 1: Register patient (ER)
- Event 4: Initial triage (ER, triage_code=3)
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology, left_leg) - note: this is a referral from ER
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
- Event 15: Patient discharged (ER, followup=outpatient_clinic)

### Case 2 (Patient 62, F, ER patient with infection):
- Event 2: Register patient (ER)
- Event 5: Initial triage (ER, triage_code=2)
- Event 8: Lab test requested (ER, test_type=blood_panel)
- Event 10: Lab test completed (Laboratory, results=normal_levels) - note: this is a referral from ER
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER, diagnosis=minor_infection)
- Event 14: Prescription created (ER, medication=antibiotics)
- Event 17: Patient discharged (ER, followup=pharmacy_pickup)

### Case 3 (Patient 28, M, Surgery patient for knee surgery):
- Event 3: Register patient (Surgery) - note: this is in Surgery department, not ER
- Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery, prep_type=general_anesthesia)
- Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery, procedure=arthroscopy)
- Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery, condition=stable)
- Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery, followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

### Important: 
- There is no overlap in patients: each has unique age and gender.
- The timestamps are interleaved but the sequences for each patient are logically consistent.
- Departments are consistent: Patient 45M and 62F are primarily ER, while 28M is Surgery.

### Final Grouping:
**Case 1 (45M):** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
**Case 2 (62F):** Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  
**Case 3 (28M):** Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

This grouping ensures each case has a coherent patient journey from registration to discharge.
