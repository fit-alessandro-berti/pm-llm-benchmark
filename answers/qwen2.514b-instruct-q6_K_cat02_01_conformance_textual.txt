To address the task, we'll go through each case in the provided event log and check if it adheres to the given normative process flow.

### Case 1
**Sequence:**
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Authorize payment
- Package items
- Ship order
- Close order

This sequence follows all specified rules:
- Payment authorization happens after checking inventory.
- Packaging occurs only after payment authorization and before shipping.
- The order is shipped only after packaging, which aligns with the normative description.
- It ends with closing the order.

**Conclusion:** This case does not violate any process norms.

### Case 2
**Sequence:**
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Package items (without authorization)
- Authorize payment
- Ship order
- Close order

This sequence violates the rules because:
- "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which is not allowed according to the description as payment must be authorized before packaging.

**Conclusion:** This case violates a norm by packaging items before authorizing payment.

### Case 3
**Sequence:**
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Authorize payment (though inventory was insufficient for shipment)
- Cancel order
- Ship order (after cancellation)
- Close order

This sequence contains multiple violations:
1. "Authorize payment" should not happen after checking the inventory and knowing it is insufficient.
2. "Ship order" appears after a "Cancel order," which is explicitly forbidden.

**Conclusion:** This case violates norms by authorizing payment before determining insufficiency, attempting to ship an already canceled order, and not adhering strictly to the cancellation flow.

### Case 4
**Sequence:**
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Cancel order
- Close order

This sequence is correct:
- It follows the expected pattern for a case where there's insufficient inventory.
- Payment authorization or packaging activities are avoided post-cancellation.

**Conclusion:** This case adheres to the normative process flow.

### Case 5
**Sequence:**
- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Authorize payment (without adequate check of inventory)
- Ship order (without proper package preparation)
- Close order

This sequence violates rules:
1. "Authorize payment" occurs directly after checking inventory but before ensuring the items are packaged, which might imply a misunderstanding about sufficient checks.
2. It omits packaging as per normative process steps and jumps straight to shipping.

**Conclusion:** This case violates norms by authorizing payment too soon without proper follow-up and skipping package preparation prior to shipment.

### Summary of Violations:

- **Case 2:** Authorize payment before packaging.
- **Case 3:** Incorrect sequence involving authorization post-insufficiency, attempting ship after cancellation.
- **Case 5:** Missing package preparation step between payment authorization and shipping.

Each identified violation reflects a deviation from the explicitly stated norms in the textual description.
