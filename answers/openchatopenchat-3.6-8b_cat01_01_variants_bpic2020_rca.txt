Based on the provided data, there are several factors contributing to performance issues in the process. Here are some specific process and data-related root causes:

1. Rejection by different stakeholders: The performance metrics are significantly lower when declarations arerejected by different stakeholders, such as Administration, Budget Owner, and Supervisors. This indicates that the process takes longer when there is a need for multiple approvals.
2. Rejections and resubmissions: The performance metrics are higher when there are multiple rejections and resubmissions before finally getting approved. This suggests that the process becomes more time-consuming and complex with multiple iterations.
3. Missing stakeholders: In some cases, the performance metrics are lower when a stakeholder (e.g., Budget Owner or Pre-Approvers) is missing or not involved in the process. This indicates that their input or approval is necessary for an efficient process.
4. Frequency of Payments: The performance metrics are lower when the frequency of payments is high (4618, 1084338.407, etc.), which may indicate a large volume of payments and a more resource-intensive process.

To address these performance issues, consider the following solutions:

1. Streamline the approval process by involving only the necessary stakeholders, reducing the complexity of the process.
2. Implement a structured workflow, and automate as much of the process as possible to reduce manual interventions and improve efficiency.
3. Establish clear roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder, ensuring they understand their responsibilities and the impact of their decisions on the process.
4. Monitor the process regularly and identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies that may contribute to performance issues and address them proactively.
