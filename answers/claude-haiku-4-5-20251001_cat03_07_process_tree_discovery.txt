# Process Tree Model

Based on the analysis of the event log, here is the discovered process tree:

```
 ( 'RA', 
     ( 'VF', 
         ( 'AE', 
            * (  ( 'RMI', 'VF' ), 
                 
            ),
             ( 'AD', 
                 ( 'SC', 'AC' )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

## Explanation

**Structure breakdown:**

1. **RA (Receive Application)** - Entry point, always executed first

2. **VF (Validate Form)** - Follows RA in sequence

3. **AE (Assess Eligibility)** - Follows VF in sequence

4. **Loop: * (  ( 'RMI', 'VF' ),  )** - This captures the optional repetition:
   - The loop body is a sequence: Request Missing Info (RMI) followed by Validate Form (VF)
   - The loop can be exited ( represents the silent exit)
   - This allows 0, 1, or multiple iterations of requesting missing info and re-validating
   - Explains why case 1 has 1 iteration and case 3 has 2 iterations, while case 2 has 0 iterations

5. **AD (Approval Decision)** - Executed after the loop exits, in sequence

6. **SC (Send Confirmation)** - Follows AD in sequence

7. **AC (Archive Case)** - Final step, follows SC in sequence

## Key Properties

- **Fitness:** Perfect (100%) - all three traces are possible
- **Precision:** High - no unnecessary behavior is allowed
- **Simplicity:** Good balance - uses a loop operator to elegantly capture the optional re-validation pattern
- **Generalizability:** The model generalizes well to cases with varying numbers of information requests and re-validations
