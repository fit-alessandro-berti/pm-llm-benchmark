### Analysis and Renaming

From the provided event logs, there are two main activities that appear multiple times within a single case: `Verify Documents` and `Call Customer`. Each time these activities occur, they have different contexts which should be reflected in their names.

#### 1. Verify Documents
- **First Occurrence:** This is the initial check of documents.
- **Second Occurrence (Case C001):** This activity happens after additional documents are submitted by the customer.
- **Second Occurrence (Case C002 & C003):** It follows an adjustment or a call to clarify discrepancies, so itâ€™s about re-verifying after changes.

#### 2. Call Customer
- **First Occurrence:** The first `Call Customer` activity is driven by either missing information or a need for clarification before moving forward.
- **Second Occurrence (Case C001):** This follows the initial call and happens as a follow-up once additional documents are submitted, essentially to inform that verification has been completed.
- **Second Occurrence (Case C002 & C003):** It's a follow-up after an account adjustment or clarification action.

### Revised Event Log

### Justification

#### Verify Documents
- **Initial Document Verification:** This clarifies that the document verification is a first-time check.
- **Reverify After Submission / Reverify After Adjustment:** These names indicate subsequent verifications after new information has been provided or an adjustment made.

#### Call Customer
- **Call for Missing Docs, Call to Clarify Discrepancy, and Call for Customer Return:** These titles specify the purpose of each call, making it clear why the customer was contacted.
- **Follow-Up Call on Adjustment:** This clarifies that the follow-up call is specifically about confirming adjustments made.

These changes make the log more understandable by providing context-specific names to activities that repeat within a case.
