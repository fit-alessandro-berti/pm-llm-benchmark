To solve this problem, we need to:

1. **Identify** all `case_id`s that have the exact sequence:
   - `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`
   - `'Create Order'`
   - `'Confirm Order'`
   in **direct succession** (no other activity in between).

2. **Filter** those `case_id`s where the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` is **more than 5 days**.

3. **Exclude** all events from these `case_id`s from the final output.

Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
WITH
-- Step 1: Find all case_ids that have the exact sequence of activities
sequence_cases AS (
  SELECT
    e1.case_id
  FROM
    event_log e1
  JOIN
    event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
  JOIN
    event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
  WHERE
    e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM event_log e
      WHERE e.case_id = e1.case_id
        AND e.timestamp > e1.timestamp
        AND e.timestamp < e2.timestamp
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM event_log e
      WHERE e.case_id = e2.case_id
        AND e.timestamp > e2.timestamp
        AND e.timestamp < e3.timestamp
    )
),

-- Step 2: Filter those case_ids where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days
filtered_cases AS (
  SELECT
    e1.case_id
  FROM
    event_log e1
  JOIN
    event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
  JOIN
    event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
  WHERE
    e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM event_log e
      WHERE e.case_id = e1.case_id
        AND e.timestamp > e1.timestamp
        AND e.timestamp < e2.timestamp
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM event_log e
      WHERE e.case_id = e2.case_id
        AND e.timestamp > e2.timestamp
        AND e.timestamp < e3.timestamp
    )
    AND (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > interval '5 days'
),

-- Step 3: Exclude all events from the filtered cases
final_result AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM event_log
  WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases)
)

-- Final output: all events except those from the filtered cases
SELECT *
FROM final_result;
```

### Notes:

- This query uses **correlated subqueries** and **JOINs** to identify the correct sequence and timing.
- The `interval '5 days'` is used to represent a time difference of more than 5 days.
- The `NOT EXISTS` clauses ensure that no other events are in between the three required activities.
- The final result includes **all events** from `event_log` **except** those from `case_id`s that had the sequence and the time condition met.

Let me know if you'd like a version that returns only the **filtered cases** or the **events from those cases**, or if you want to optimize for performance.
