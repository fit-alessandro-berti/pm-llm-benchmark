### **Analysis of the Event Log**

---

#### **1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Process Behavior)**

The normative rules define a **strict sequence** and **ordering constraints** that must be followed. Violations of these rules are **serious** and indicate non-compliance with the intended process.

| **Case ID** | **Violation(s)** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **2** |  **Multiple violations** | - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**: The Risk Assessment (08:20) occurred **before** the Credit Check (09:00), violating the rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment. <br> - **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**: The loan was rejected (09:30), but Finalize Documentation (10:00) was still performed, which is **explicitly forbidden**. <br> - **Close Case after invalid Finalize Documentation**: The case was closed (10:30) despite the invalid finalization step. |

**Summary**: Case 2 is **non-compliant** with the normative process and contains **critical violations**.

---

#### **2. Violations of Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**

Desiderata represent **best practices** that are **not strictly enforced**, but deviations may indicate inefficiencies or suboptimal behavior.

| **Case ID** | **Desideratum Violation(s)** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| **1** |  **None** | All activities followed the normative sequence, and: <br> - Credit Check was done within 30 minutes (well within 24-hour recommendation). <br> - Inform Applicant occurred within 2 hours of the decision (within 48-hour recommendation). <br> - No Follow-up Call was recorded, but this is **not required**. |
| **2** |  **Not applicable** | Since Case 2 already violates **normative rules**, desiderata are irrelevant. |
| **3** |  **Two violations** | - **Credit Check delayed**: Occurred **49 hours** after Application Received (exceeds the 24-hour recommendation). <br> - **Inform Applicant delayed**: Occurred **51 hours** after Loan Decision (exceeds the 48-hour recommendation). <br> - **No Follow-up Call**: While not required, it is **encouraged** and was omitted. |

**Summary**: Case 3 **complies with normative rules** but **fails to meet recommended best practices** (desiderata).

#### **3. Interpretations and Justifications for Observed Behaviors**

While some deviations are clear violations, others may have **contextual explanations**:

| **Case ID** | **Observed Behavior** | **Possible Justification** |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **2** | Risk Assessment before Credit Check | - **Human error**: A process worker may have mistakenly started the Risk Assessment before the Credit Check was completed. <br> - **System glitch**: A workflow automation tool may have triggered the wrong activity due to a misconfiguration. <br> - **Misinterpretation of urgency**: The worker may have prioritized speed over compliance, assuming the Credit Check would follow. |
| **2** | Finalize Documentation after Rejection | - **Process confusion**: The worker may have followed an outdated or incorrect procedure. <br> - **Over-automation**: A system may have auto-triggered "Finalize Documentation" without checking the loan decision. <br> - **Lack of training**: The worker may not have been aware that finalization is **only for approved loans**. |
| **3** | Delayed Credit Check (49 hours) | - **High application volume**: The credit team may have been overwhelmed, causing delays. <br> - **Manual review required**: The application may have needed additional scrutiny, extending the Credit Check time. <br> - **System downtime**: A technical issue may have prevented timely processing. |
| **3** | Delayed Inform Applicant (51 hours) | - **Communication backlog**: The notification team may have been understaffed. <br> - **Manual review needed**: The decision may have required additional approvals, delaying notification. <br> - **Applicant unavailability**: The applicant may not have been reachable immediately. |
| **3** | No Follow-up Call | - **Resource constraints**: The team may have lacked time or personnel to make the call. <br> - **Deemed unnecessary**: The case may have been straightforward, making a follow-up redundant. <br> - **Oversight**: The call may have been forgotten or deprioritized. |

### **Final Summary**

| **Case ID** | **Normative Compliance** | **Desiderata Compliance** | **Key Issues** |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **1** |  **Fully compliant** |  **Fully compliant** | No issues. |
| **2** |  **Non-compliant** |  **N/A (already violates norms)** | - Risk Assessment before Credit Check. <br> - Finalize Documentation after rejection. |
| **3** |  **Compliant** |  **Partially compliant** | - Credit Check and Inform Applicant delayed. <br> - No Follow-up Call. |

### **Recommendations for Process Improvement**
1. **For Case 2 (Critical Violations):**
   - **Training**: Ensure all process workers understand the **strict sequence** and **decision-dependent steps** (e.g., no finalization after rejection).
   - **Automation safeguards**: Implement **system-level checks** to prevent activities from being performed out of order (e.g., block Risk Assessment until Credit Check is complete).
   - **Audit trails**: Log deviations and flag them for review to prevent recurrence.

2. **For Case 3 (Desiderata Violations):**
   - **Performance monitoring**: Track **time-to-completion** for Credit Check and Inform Applicant to identify bottlenecks.
   - **Resource allocation**: If delays are due to high volume, consider **hiring temporary staff** or **automating notifications**.
   - **Follow-up call policy**: While not mandatory, **encourage** follow-ups by making them a **low-effort task** (e.g., a quick automated survey).

3. **General Improvements:**
   - **Process mining tools**: Use tools like **Disco, Celonis, or PM4Py** to **automatically detect deviations** in real time.
   - **Feedback loops**: Allow workers to **flag process inefficiencies** (e.g., "Credit Check takes too long because of X").
   - **Continuous training**: Regularly update workers on **best practices** and **common pitfalls**.

By addressing these issues, the loan application process can become **more compliant, efficient, and user-friendly**.
