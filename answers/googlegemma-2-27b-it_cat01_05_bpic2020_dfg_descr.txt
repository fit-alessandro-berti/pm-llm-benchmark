This process seems to describe a workflow related to **expense *management* or **payment approval* in a company. 

Here's a breakdown of the potential process flow based on your provided data:

**Process Stages:**

* **Declaration SUBMITTED:** This refers to the initial step where an employee submits an expense declaration.
* **Declaration APPROVED:** The declaration moves through various approval stages for different roles.
* **DIRECT:** An undefined state where a process is executed directly, bypassing other stages.

**Possible Workflow:**


While the exact workflow isn't explicitly laid out in the provided data (it only shows us the steps, not necessarily the order or individual triggers), we can conceptually reconstruct it based on the transitions within the provided "Declarations" context, with some educated assumptions:

**1. Declaration Submission:**

* The process typically begins with an "EMPLOYEE" submitting an expense *declaration*.

**2. Initial Stages - Administration and Internship:**

* This process may be outlining a larger, more detailed workflow with Pre-Approval stages. 

* "EMPLOYEE" submits a request through a process called, respectively, "EMPLOYEE" -> "boolean" -> "Declaration Approved by ADMINISTRATION"
* "ADMINISTRATION" likely represents a role, like an admin approving expenses- a workflow separating " intern" related workflow steps from ususal "EMPLOYEE" operations ("dept" could indicate approval  has different steps)

**3.  Stages After Administration Approve:**

* **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Payment Request (Document Signed) -> Administration Approval**:

     * If the result of the "Administration" related process suffers alterations, the Nömal state proceeds with standard steps of review, approval, and for different stakeholder roles.

* **Further Stages - Sherry's Process vs. Default Process:** A possible logical conclusion to this process step (assuming a different process is the "default" for certain scenarios): "Employee" processes a standard expense declaration and submit it. Based on this assumption, these roles would then need to be submitted by "Supervisor" for final approval or **payment authorization**:

**3. Response Dependent:**

* We need more information to clearly determine what happens in the [áro Subject to…]

**Key Observations:**

* **Hierarchical Approval:** The fragment mentioned "Administration" -> "Payment Approved by » Administration«" suggests a process of hierarchical approval for the initial stages, where an independent team/department (likely " concorso" means the employee submits the "declaration"
