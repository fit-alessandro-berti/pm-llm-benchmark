Sure! Let's create a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. This process typically involves several activities such as initiation of purchase orders, receipt of goods, invoice processing, payment, and archiving. Here is a possible temporal profile for such a process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('initiate_purchase_order', 'send_po'): (60, 30),          # Average time: 1 minute, Standard deviation: 0.5 minutes
    ('send_po', 'receive_goods'): (24 * 3600, 8 * 3600),      # Average time: 1 day, Standard deviation: 2 hours
    ('receive_goods', 'record_receipt'): (30, 10),            # Average time: 0.5 minutes, Standard deviation: 0.167 minutes
    ('record_receipt', 'send_invoice'): (12 * 3600, 2 * 3600), # Average time: 2 hours, Standard deviation: 0.5 hours
    ('send_invoice', 'pay_invoice'): (5 * 3600, 1 * 3600),     # Average time: 5 minutes, Standard deviation: 1 minute
    ('pay_invoice', 'archive'): (300, 60),                    # Average time: 5 minutes, Standard deviation: 1 minute
    ('initiate_purchase_order', 'record_receipt'): (600, 120), # Average time: 10 minutes, Standard deviation: 2 minutes
    ('initiate_purchase_order', 'send_invoice'): (25 * 3600, 5 * 3600), # Average time: 7 hours, Standard deviation: 1.5 hours
    ('initiate_purchase_order', 'pay_invoice'): (30 * 3600, 6 * 3600), # Average time: 8 hours, Standard deviation: 2 hours
    ('initiate_purchase_order', 'archive'): (32 * 3600, 4 * 3600)  # Average time: 8.5 hours, Standard deviation: 1 hour
}

### Explanation:
1. **initiate_purchase_order to send_po**: The average time between initiating a purchase order and sending it is 1 minute with a standard deviation of 0.5 minutes.
2. **send_po to receive_goods**: The average time between sending the purchase order and receiving the goods is 1 day (24 hours) with a standard deviation of 2 hours.
3. **receive_goods to record_receipt**: The average time between receiving the goods and recording the receipt is 0.5 minutes with a standard deviation of 0.167 minutes.
4. **record_receipt to send_invoice**: The average time between recording the receipt and sending the invoice is 2 hours with a standard deviation of 0.5 hours.
5. **send_invoice to pay_invoice**: The average time between sending the invoice and paying it is 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1 minute.
6. **pay_invoice to archive**: The average time between paying the invoice and archiving it is 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1 minute.
7. **initiate_purchase_order to record_receipt**: The average time between initiating the purchase order and recording the receipt is 10 minutes with a standard deviation of 2 minutes.
8. **initiate_purchase_order to send_invoice**: The average time between initiating the purchase order and sending the invoice is 7 hours with a standard deviation of 1.5 hours.
9. **initiate_purchase_order to pay_invoice**: The average time between initiating the purchase order and paying the invoice is 8 hours with a standard deviation of 2 hours.
10. **initiate_purchase_order to archive**: The average time between initiating the purchase order and archiving is 8.5 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour.

This temporal profile can be adjusted according to specific needs and real-world data.
