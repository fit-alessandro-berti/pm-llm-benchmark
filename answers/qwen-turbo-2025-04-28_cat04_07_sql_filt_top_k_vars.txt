Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the goal is to write a DuckDB SQL query that does a few things: first, get the ordered sequence of activities per case, then group by those sequences to find unique variants, count how many cases each variant has, find the top K variants, and then return all events from those top K cases.

First, I need to figure out how to get the ordered sequence of activities for each case. Since each case has multiple events, and they need to be ordered by timestamp. So for each case_id, I need to collect the activities in the order of their timestamps. In SQL, I think this can be done using the array_agg function with an order by clause. Like, for each case_id, aggregate the activities into an array, ordered by timestamp. That should give me the sequence.

So, the first part would be a subquery where I group by case_id and create an array of activities ordered by timestamp. Let me check: in DuckDB, array_agg has an ORDER BY option. So something like SELECT case_id, array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id. That should give me each case's variant as an array.

Next, I need to group these variants. But since the variant is an array, I can't just group by it directly in some databases, but DuckDB might handle it. Wait, in DuckDB, can you group by an array? I think so, because arrays are considered as single values. So then, I can take that subquery and group by the variant array to count the number of cases per variant. So, then I would have a query like:

SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM (
    SELECT case_id, array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY count DESC;

But then I need to get the top K variants. So, after getting the counts, I can use a LIMIT K, but I need to make sure that if there are ties, they are handled properly. However, the problem says "top K variants by their frequency", so maybe just take the top K based on count.

Once I have the top K variants, I need to get all the events from the original event_log that belong to cases in those top K variants.

So, the plan is:

1. For each case, get its variant (ordered activities).
2. Find the frequency of each variant.
3. Select the top K variants.
4. Get all cases that belong to those top K variants.
5. Retrieve all events from those cases.

Now, how to implement this in SQL.

First, the subquery to get each case's variant. Then, another subquery to get the counts. Then, find the top K variants. But how to get the top K? Maybe using a CTE (Common Table Expression) to get the counts, then select the top K, then join back to the original event_log.

But how to handle the top K. Let's say K is a parameter. But since the user didn't specify K, maybe the query should have a placeholder. However, the problem says "top K variants", so the query should probably have a LIMIT K, but since K is not given, perhaps the user expects the query to have a parameter. However, the problem says to write the query, so maybe K is a variable, and the user would replace it. But for the purpose of the query, we can use a placeholder.

But in the final query, the user would need to specify K. However, the problem says to return the top K, so the query must include that.

So, putting it all together:

First, get the case variants:

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
)

Then, get the case_ids that are in the top K variants:

SELECT case_id
FROM case_variants
WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)

But wait, the variant is an array. So, in the WHERE clause, comparing arrays. But in DuckDB, can you compare arrays directly? I think so. So, the subquery variant_counts would have the top K variants, and then we can select the case_ids whose variant is in that list.

Once we have those case_ids, we can join back to the original event_log to get all events for those cases.

So the final query would be:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)
)

But putting it all together in one query.

But how to handle the K? Let's assume that K is a parameter. So the complete query would be:

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts);

Wait, but in the variant_counts CTE, I need to count the variants. Wait, the first CTE is case_variants, which has each case's variant. Then, to get the counts, I need to group by variant in case_variants. So the variant_counts CTE should be:

SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT K

But then, to get the variants, I need to select variant from that. So the variant_counts CTE would have the top K variants.

But in the query above, the variant_counts CTE is written as selecting variant, but without the count. Wait, no, the original plan was to get the counts, then select the top K variants. So the variant_counts CTE would have the variants, ordered by count, then limited to K.

But in the code above, the variant_counts CTE is written as:

SELECT variant
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT K

But that's not correct, because in the GROUP BY, you need to have the aggregate functions. Wait, no. Wait, in the case_variants CTE, each row is a case_id and its variant. So, if I do:

SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT K

That would give me the top K variants. But in the previous example, the variant_counts CTE was written as selecting variant, but that would require grouping. So the correct way is:

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT K
)

But in DuckDB, can you do ORDER BY COUNT(*) in a GROUP BY? Yes, because when you group by variant, each group is a variant, and COUNT(*) is the count of cases per variant. So that would work.

But then, the variant_counts CTE would have the list of variants (arrays) that are in the top K.

Then, the final step is to select all events where the case_id is in the case_variants where variant is in variant_counts.

But how to get the case_ids? So:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)
)

But in the case_variants, each case_id is present once, and the variant is the array. So the subquery would get all case_ids whose variant is in the top K variants.

Putting all together, the full query would be:

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)
);

But wait, in the variant_counts CTE, the SELECT variant is from case_variants grouped by variant. So the variant_counts would have the list of variants (arrays) that are in the top K.

But in DuckDB, when you do GROUP BY variant, the variant is a column, so the SELECT variant would be allowed.

But I need to make sure that the variant is correctly compared. Also, the LIMIT K would take the top K variants based on their count.

But what if there are multiple variants with the same count? For example, if K=2 and there are three variants with the same count. The LIMIT K would take the first two, but the exact order might depend on the database's handling. However, the problem says "top K variants by their frequency", so this approach is acceptable.

Now, testing this query. Let's think about possible issues.

First, the array_agg in DuckDB: the syntax is correct? Yes, array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp). So that should generate the ordered sequence.

Then, grouping by variant. Since variant is an array, grouping by it would group all cases with the same sequence.

Then, in the variant_counts CTE, the GROUP BY variant would group the variants, and the ORDER BY COUNT(*) would order them by the number of cases. Then, LIMIT K gives the top K.

Then, the final selection of events is done by joining the case_variants with the variant_counts.

But in the subquery for the case_ids, we have to make sure that the variant is in the variant_counts. Since variant is an array, comparing arrays should work.

Another thing: the original event_log may have multiple events per case, and the final result should include all events from cases in the top K variants.

Another possible approach is to use a CTE for the top variants, then join with the case_variants to get the case_ids, then join with event_log.

But the query seems correct.

But what about the case where K is 0? Well, the problem probably assumes K is a positive integer.

Now, the user might want to replace K with a specific number, but in the query, it's left as K. However, in DuckDB, you can use a parameter. But since the problem says to return the query, perhaps the user expects K to be a placeholder.

But the problem says "top K variants", so the query should have a LIMIT K. So the final query as written is correct.

Another thing: the variant_counts CTE could be written as:

SELECT variant
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT K

Yes.

So, putting it all together, the SQL query would be as above.

But let me check if there's a more efficient way. For example, perhaps using a subquery instead of CTEs. But the CTE approach is clearer.

Another possible issue: in DuckDB, when you do array_agg, the order is preserved. So the ORDER BY in array_agg is essential here.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the final query should be:

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts);

Alternatively, using IN with a subquery. But the JOIN might be more efficient, but for the purpose of the query, either way is acceptable.

But the WHERE clause with IN is also correct.

Another thing: the case_variants CTE is used twice. Once to get the variants, and once to get the case_ids. But since it's a CTE, it's computed once.

So, this should work.

Now, testing with sample data.

Sample data:

case_id | activity | timestamp
1       | A        | 2023-01-01
1       | B        | 2023-01-02
2       | A        | 2023-01-01
2       | C        | 2023-01-02
3       | A        | 2023-01-01
3       | B        | 2023-01-02

Then, case_variants would have:

case_id | variant
1       | ['A', 'B']
2       | ['A', 'C']
3       | ['A', 'B']

variant_counts would group by variant:

['A', 'B'] has 2 cases, ['A', 'C'] has 1. So if K=1, variant_counts would have ['A', 'B'].

Then, the final query selects all events from case_ids 1 and 3.

Which is correct.

So the query seems to work.

Another edge case: if two variants have the same count. For example, if K=1 and two variants have the same count. The LIMIT 1 would pick one, but which one? It depends on the database's ordering. But the problem says "top K", so it's acceptable.

So, the query seems correct.
</think>
Here is a well-structured and optimized **DuckDB SQL query** that fulfills all the requirements outlined in the prompt. This query performs the following steps:

1. **Extracts the ordered sequence of activities** per `case_id`, sorted by `timestamp`.
2. **Groups cases by their activity sequence** (i.e., process variant).
3. **Counts the number of cases per variant** and identifies the **top K variants** by frequency.
4. **Returns all events** from the original `event_log` that belong to the **top K variants**.

###  Final SQL Query

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT :K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts);
```

---

###  Notes and Explanations

- **`ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`**  
  This constructs the **ordered sequence of activities** for each `case_id`, preserving the chronological order of events based on the `timestamp`.

- **`variant_counts` CTE**  
  Groups the variants (activity sequences), counts how many times each occurs, and returns only the **top K variants** using `LIMIT :K`. Replace `:K` with the desired value (e.g., 5).

- **Final Selection**  
  The query joins the original `event_log` with the `case_variants` CTE to filter only those `case_id`s whose variant appears in the top K variants.

---

###  Example Usage

Suppose you want to retrieve the **top 3** most frequent variants:

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 3
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts);
```

---

###  Important Considerations

- **Array Comparison**  
  DuckDB supports array comparisons, so `cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)` is valid and efficient.
  
- **Performance**  
  If the dataset is large, consider indexing or materializing the `case_variants` CTE to improve performance.

- **Parameterization**  
  The `LIMIT :K` clause is parameterized (`:K`) to allow dynamic input. In practice, you can replace `:K` with a specific integer or use a prepared statement.

This query is concise, readable, and aligns with best practices in SQL for handling process variants and filtering based on frequency.
