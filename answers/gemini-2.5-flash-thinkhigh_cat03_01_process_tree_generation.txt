To construct the complex process tree, we will follow the specified steps, building sub-trees for each phase and then combining them sequentially. We will use the `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessTree` class and `Operator` enumeration.

Here's a breakdown of the construction:

1.  **Initial Patient Journey:** A sequence of 'Arriving (A)', 'Registration (RG)', and 'Intake Assessment (IA)'.
    *   Notation: `-> ( 'A', -> ( 'RG', 'IA' ) )`
    *   Pm4py: A single `SEQUENCE` node with A, RG, and IA as children.

2.  **Triage Process:** A sequence of 'Triage Interview (TI)' and 'Triage Classification (TC)'.
    *   Notation: `-> ( 'TI', 'TC' )`
    *   Pm4py: A single `SEQUENCE` node with TI and TC as children.

3.  **Initial Diagnostic Tests:** An exclusive choice between 'Comprehensive ECG (CE)' and 'Full Blood Panel (FBP)'.
    *   Notation: `X ( 'CE', 'FBP' )`
    *   Pm4py: An `XOR` node with CE and FBP as children.

4.  **Loop for Abnormal Results:** This is a loop (`*`) where the body of the loop (`A` in `*(A,B)`) consists of 'Specialist Consultation (SC)', followed by an exclusive choice of 'Targeted Medication (TM)' or 'Specialized Physical Therapy (SPT)', followed by an exclusive choice of 'Follow-up ECG (FCE)' or 'Follow-up Blood Analysis (FBA)'. The `B` part of the loop (what to execute before returning to `A`) is a silent step (`tau`) as the re-entry is conditional on abnormal results.
    *   Loop Body Notation (A): `-> ( 'SC', -> ( X ( 'TM', 'SPT' ), X ( 'FCE', 'FBA' ) ) )`
    *   Full Loop Notation: `* ( -> ( 'SC', -> ( X ( 'TM', 'SPT' ), X ( 'FCE', 'FBA' ) ) ), tau )`
    *   Pm4py: A `LOOP` node where its first child is a `SEQUENCE` node representing the loop body, and its second child is a `ProcessTree` object with label 'tau'.

5.  **Advanced Diagnostics and Support:** True concurrency between 'Advanced Imaging (AI)' and 'Nutritional Counseling (NC)'.
    *   Notation: `+ ( 'AI', 'NC' )`
    *   Pm4py: A `PARALLEL` node with AI and NC as children.

6.  **Final Administrative and Informational Steps:** A sequence of 'Follow-up Appointment Scheduling (FAS)' and 'Detailed Discharge Instructions (DDI)'.
    *   Notation: `-> ( 'FAS', 'DDI' )`
    *   Pm4py: A `SEQUENCE` node with FAS and DDI as children.

7.  **Final Clearance:** True concurrency between 'Billing (BL)', 'Insurance Claims Processing (ICP)', and 'Medical Records Finalization (MRF)'. Since `+` is binary, this will be nested.
    *   Notation: `+ ( 'BL', + ( 'ICP', 'MRF' ) )`
    *   Pm4py: A `PARALLEL` node where one child is BL and the other child is another `PARALLEL` node containing ICP and MRF.

Finally, all these major phases are executed sequentially.
