### Anomalies Identified in the Temporal Profile Model

#### Anomaly 1: R to P (Receive to Approve)
- **Average Time:** Approximately 25 hours
- **Standard Deviation:** Very low (around 1 hour)

**Possible Reasons:**
- **Artificial Schedule:** The low standard deviation suggests a rigid, predetermined schedule for approval, which might not align with real-world business processes.
- **Manual Data Entry Issues:** Delays caused by manual data entry errors or system bottlenecks can lead to artificially low standard deviations as the same delays occur repeatedly.

#### Anomaly 2: P to N (Approve to Notify)
- **Average Time:** 7 days
- **Standard Deviation:** High (2 days)

**Possible Reasons:**
- **Internal Backlog:** Long delays might be due to backlogs in the approval process, where notifications are sent only when all previous steps have been completed.
- **Resource Constraints:** Limited resources or high demand during peak periods can cause significant delays in sending out notifications.
- **Automated Notifications Skipped:** Some claims might bypass the notification step entirely, leading to longer approval-to-notification times.

#### Anomaly 3: A to C (Assign to Close)
- **Average Time:** 2 hours
- **Standard Deviation:** Low (around 1 hour)

**Possible Reasons:**
- **Premature Closure:** Claims might be closed immediately after assignment without going through necessary evaluations or approvals, suggesting a lack of thorough review.
- **Systematic Error:** Errors in the system might cause claims to be marked as closed prematurely, leading to shorter overall processing times.

#### Anomaly 4: E to N (Evaluate to Notify)
- **Average Time:** 5 minutes
- **Standard Deviation:** Low (around 1 minute)

**Possible Reasons:**
- **Too-Rapid Transition:** Evaluations might be completed so quickly that they skip critical checks or reviews, leading to potentially flawed decisions being communicated to customers.
- **Automated Evaluation Skips:** Automated systems might evaluate claims too swiftly, missing important details or requiring additional human intervention later.

### Verification Queries Using SQL

To verify these anomalies, we can run the following SQL queries on the `claim_events` table:

#### Query 1: Identify Specific Claims with Anomalous R to P Times
```sql
SELECT ce.*
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'R' AND ce.timestamp + INTERVAL '25 hours' < (
    SELECT timestamp
    FROM claim_events ce2
    JOIN claims c2 ON ce2.claim_id = c2.claim_id
    WHERE ce2.activity = 'P'
);
```
This query identifies claims where the time from receive to approve exceeds 25 hours.

#### Query 2: Correlate Anomalies with Particular Adjusters
```sql
SELECT ae.adjuster_id, COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN adjusters ae ON ce.resource = ae.name
WHERE ce.activity IN ('R', 'P') AND ce.timestamp + INTERVAL '25 hours' > (
    SELECT timestamp
    FROM claim_events ce2
    JOIN claims c2 ON ce2.claim_id = c2.claim_id
    WHERE ce2.activity = 'P'
)
GROUP BY ae.adjuster_id;
```
This query counts how many claims each adjuster has processed with anomalous R to P times.

#### Query 3: Filter by Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment
```sql
SELECT ce.*, c.customer_id, c.region
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'A' AND ce.timestamp + INTERVAL '2 hours' < (
    SELECT timestamp
    FROM claim_events ce2
    JOIN claims c2 ON ce2.claim_id = c2.claim_id
    WHERE ce2.activity = 'C'
);
```
This query finds claims that were closed immediately after assignment, suggesting premature closures.

#### Query 4: Check Excessively Long Approval to Notification Times
```sql
SELECT ce.*, c.customer_id, c.region
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'P' AND ce.timestamp + INTERVAL '7 days' < (
    SELECT timestamp
    FROM claim_events ce2
    JOIN claims c2 ON ce2.claim_id = c2.claim_id
    WHERE ce2.activity = 'N'
);
```
This query identifies claims where the approval to notification time exceeds 7 days, highlighting potential issues with notification delays.

By running these queries, you can gather insights into the root causes of the observed anomalies and take corrective actions to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the claim handling process.
