# **Data-Driven Process Improvement for TechSolve Solutions’ Resource Assignment**
*Optimizing Tiered Support via Process Mining and Skill-Based Routing*

---

## **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**
To systematically assess TechSolve’s resource assignment inefficiencies, process mining will be applied to extract actionable insights from the event log. Key analyses include:

### **A. Agent and Tier Performance Metrics**
**Focused Metrics:**
- **Workload Distribution:**
  - *Per-Agent Workload:* Time spent per ticket type (e.g., P1-P4, categories, required skills) to identify overloaded vs. underutilized agents.
  - *Tier-Specific Metrics:* Average time-to-resolution (TTR) per tier, first-call resolution (FCR) rate for L1, and escalation frequency.
  - *Skill Utilization:* Percentage of time agents spend on tasks matching their documented skills vs. mismatched roles.

- **Activity Processing Times:**
  - *L1 Bottlenecks:* Time spent resolving vs. escalating tickets (e.g., high escalation rate for P3/P4 tickets).
  - *L2/L3 Efficiency:* Average TTR for tickets requiring specialized skills (e.g., Networking-Firewall vs. App-CRM).
  - *Escalation Latency:* Time between initial assignment and reassignment/re-escalation.

- **First-Call Resolution (FCR):**
  - *L1 Success Rate:* Percentage of P1/P2 tickets resolved without escalation.
  - *Skill-Based FCR:* FCR by required skill (e.g., tickets needing "App-CRM" vs. "Networking-Firewall").

### **B. Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Patterns**
**Resource Interaction Analysis:**
- **Handovers and Reassignments:** Use **trace alignment** to identify:
  - Frequent reassignments between L1/L2 or L2/L3.
  - "Hotspots" where agents repeatedly handle the same skill type (e.g., Agent B12 always reassigned for DB-SQL).
  - *Comparison:* Intended vs. actual assignment paths (e.g., round-robin vs. skill-based routing).

**Social Network Analysis (SNA):**
- **Agent Collaboration Graphs:**
  - Visualize handovers between agents (e.g., Agent A05  Agent B12  Agent B15) to detect:
    - *Skill Redundancy:* Multiple agents handling the same skill (e.g., "App-CRM").
    - *Skill Gaps:* Agents with high workload but no matching skills (e.g., L2 agent with "OS-WindowsServer" skills assigned to "Security-IAM").
  - *Centrality Measures:* Identify "bottleneck" agents who frequently mediate between tiers.

**Role Discovery:**
- **Dynamic Role Assignment:**
  - Use **conceptual clustering** (e.g., PM4Py’s *conceptual clustering*) to group tickets by:
    - *Skill Requirements:* "App-CRM" vs. "Networking-Firewall" clusters.
    - *Complexity Patterns:* High-priority tickets (P2/P3) vs. low-complexity (P4).
  - *Implication:* Reveal if current role definitions (L1/L2/L3) align with actual skill needs.

### **C. Skill Utilization Analysis**
**Key Questions:**
- *Are specialists (L2/L3) being underutilized?* (e.g., Agent B12 with "App-CRM" skills assigned to 80% "Basic-Troubleshoot" tickets.)
- *Are L1 agents over-responsibilized?* (e.g., handling tickets requiring "Networking-Firewall" skills.)
- *Skill Mismatch Rate:* Percentage of tickets assigned to agents lacking the required skill (e.g., "App-CRM"  "Basic-Troubleshoot").

**Methods:**
- **Skill Matching Heatmap:**
  - Cross-tabulate **ticket required skills** vs. **assigned agent skills** to identify:
    - *Critical Gaps:* High-frequency skills (e.g., "App-CRM") assigned to low-skill agents.
    - *Over-Specialization:* Agents with rare skills (e.g., "Security-IAM") assigned to low-complexity tickets.
- **Agent Skill Proficiency Scoring:**
  - Assign weights to skills based on historical resolution success (e.g., "App-CRM" tickets resolved by L1 agents 60% of the time vs. 20% by L2).

## **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**
### **A. Quantifying Problems from Process Mining**
| **Issue**                          | **Metric**                          | **Impact**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Skill Mismatch**                 | % of tickets assigned to agents lacking required skill | Increases escalation frequency, delays.                                  |
| **Frequent Reassignments**         | Avg. reassignments per ticket       | ~30% of tickets reassigned (vs. 5% ideal).                                  |
| **L1 Escalation Overload**          | % of L1 tickets escalated to L2     | ~40% of P3/P4 tickets escalated (vs. 20% target).                          |
| **L2/L3 Bottlenecks**              | Avg. TTR for L2/L3 tickets          | ~2.5 hours (vs. 1 hour SLA).                                               |
| **SLA Breaches Correlated with Reassignments** | % of SLA-breached tickets with 2 reassignments | ~60% of SLA failures linked to reassignments.                              |
| **Underutilized Specialists**       | % of L2/L3 agents handling low-skill tickets | Agent B12 handles 70% "Basic-Troubleshoot" tickets despite "App-CRM" skills. |

### **B. Root Causes of Assignment Inefficiencies**
1. **Deficient Assignment Rules:**
   - Current logic relies on **round-robin + manual escalation**, ignoring:
     - *Ticket complexity* (P2/P3 vs. P4).
     - *Required skill overlap* with agent profiles.
     - *Real-time workload* (e.g., L1 queue length).

2. **Incomplete Agent Skill Profiles:**
   - Skills documented may not reflect **current proficiency** (e.g., Agent B12’s "App-CRM" skills may be outdated).
   - Lack of **skill proficiency weights** (e.g., "App-CRM" vs. "Networking-Firewall" may require different agent tiers).

3. **Poor Initial Ticket Categorization:**
   - Misclassified tickets (e.g., "Software-App" mislabeled as "Hardware") lead to skill mismatches.
   - *Example:* Ticket INC-1002 (Networking-Firewall) assigned to L1 with "Basic-Troubleshoot" skills.

4. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
   - Dispatchers lack **agent availability + skill capacity** data when assigning tickets.
   - *Result:* Overloading high-skill agents (e.g., assigning "Security-IAM" to an overloaded L2 agent).

5. **Excessive L1 Escalations:**
   - L1 agents lack **empowerment to escalate** or **training to identify high-complexity tickets**.
   - *Example:* Agent A05 escalates P3 tickets needing "App-CRM" even though L1 could resolve 70% of similar cases.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis with Process Mining Tools**
### **A. Variant Analysis**
**Comparing "Good" vs. "Bad" Assignments:**
- **Good Assignments (1 reassignment or none):**
  - *Common Features:*
    - Ticket assigned to an agent with **direct matching skills**.
    - L1 resolved the ticket within 30 minutes (FCR).
    - No skill mismatch in required vs. assigned agent skills.
- **Bad Assignments (2 reassignments):**
  - *Common Features:*
    - Ticket required **high-skill** (e.g., "Networking-Firewall") assigned to L1.
    - L1 agent lacked **proven success** with that skill (e.g., 0% FCR for "App-CRM").
    - **Skill gap:** Assigned agent’s skills were **not in top 3** of required skills.

**Decision Mining:**
- Extract **rules** from assignment decisions (e.g., "If ticket is P3 AND Category=Software-App AND Required Skill=App-CRM, assign to L2").
- Identify **decision drift** where rules are violated (e.g., assigning "App-CRM" to L1 despite high escalation rate).

### **B. Skill Proficiency Modeling**
- **Skill Proficiency Matrix:**
  - Map each agent’s **historical success rate** by skill (e.g., "App-CRM"  0.7 FCR for L1, 0.95 for L2).
  - *Example:* Agent B12’s "App-CRM" skill has a 0.6 FCR rate, but the team expects 0.85. This suggests **skill decay** or **misclassification**.

## **4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**
### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weights**
**Problem Addressed:**
- Current routing ignores **agent skill proficiency** and **ticket complexity**, leading to skill mismatches.

**Implementation:**
1. **Skill Proficiency Scoring:**
   - Assign weights to skills based on:
     - *FCR history* (e.g., "App-CRM"  0.8, "Networking-Firewall"  0.6).
     - *Tier suitability* (e.g., "Security-IAM" requires L3, "Basic-Troubleshoot" can be L1).
2. **Dynamic Assignment Algorithm:**
   - **Priority Rule:** Assign ticket to the agent with the **highest weighted skill match**.
     - *Example:* For "App-CRM" ticket:
       - L1 Agent A05 (skills: Basic-Troubleshoot, App-CRM)  Score = 0.8.
       - L2 Agent B12 (skills: App-CRM, DB-SQL)  Score = 0.9.
       - Assign to **B12** (higher score).
   - **Fallback:** If no agent matches 80% skill score, escalate to next tier.

**Data Required:**
- Historical FCR data by skill/tier.
- Agent skill proficiency logs.
- Ticket required skills (extracted from descriptions/keywords).

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Reduced reassignments** by 40% (from 30% to 18%).
- **Improved SLA compliance** for P2/P3 tickets (from 60% to 85%).
- **Better skill utilization** (e.g., L2 agents spend 60% on high-skill tasks).

---

### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Assignment with Real-Time Queue Monitoring**
**Problem Addressed:**
- Current round-robin ignores **agent workload** and **queue lengths**, leading to bottlenecks.

**Implementation:**
1. **Real-Time Workload Tracking:**
   - Maintain **live queues** for each agent/tier (e.g., L1 queue length, L2 agent B12’s current tickets).
   - **Priority Rule:** Assign tickets to:
     - *Lowest queue agent* with **matching skills** (weighted by proficiency).
     - *If no match:* Escalate to next tier.
2. **Dynamic Tier Adjustment:**
   - If L1 queue > 5 tickets and L2 agent B12 is idle, **auto-assign a P4 ticket** to B12 to prevent L1 overload.

**Data Required:**
- Real-time ticket queue lengths.
- Agent availability (e.g., "Agent B12 is busy with 3 tickets").
- Historical TTR data to predict workload spikes.

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Reduced L1 queue backlog** by 35%.
- **Fewer L2/L3 bottlenecks** (e.g., Agent B12 handles 50% more high-skill tickets).
- **Smoother escalations** (e.g., P3 tickets escalated only when necessary).

---

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Using Ticket Characteristics**
**Problem Addressed:**
- Current escalation rules are **static** and ignore **ticket patterns** (e.g., "App-CRM" tickets often resolved by L1).

**Implementation:**
1. **Machine Learning-Based Prediction:**
   - Train a model to predict:
     - *Likely resolution tier* based on ticket attributes (e.g., "App-CRM" + P3  70% FCR for L1).
     - *Skill requirements* from ticket descriptions (e.g., keywords "firewall"  "Networking-Firewall").
2. **Automated Escalation Thresholds:**
   - **Rule-Based + ML Hybrid:**
     - *If ticket is P3 AND Category=Software-App AND FCR history shows 70% L1 success  Assign to L1.*
     - *If ticket has "Networking-Firewall" AND L1 FCR < 50%  Escalate to L2.*

**Data Required:**
- Historical FCR data by ticket category/skill.
- Ticket descriptions (NLP to extract keywords).
- Agent skill proficiency logs.

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Reduced escalations by 50%** (from 40% to 20%).
- **Improved SLA compliance** for P3 tickets (from 60% to 90%).
- **Empowered L1 agents** to resolve more tickets independently.

---

### **Strategy 4: Dynamic Tier Reallocation (L1/L2/L3 Flexibility)**
**Problem Addressed:**
- Fixed tier assignments lead to **overloading high-skill agents** or **underutilizing L1**.

**Implementation:**
1. **Agent Tier Flexibility:**
   - Allow **L1 agents to handle P3 tickets** if:
     - They have **proven FCR history** (e.g., 80% FCR for "App-CRM").
     - The ticket is **not critical** (e.g., P3 but no SLA pressure).
   - **L2/L3 agents can handle P4 tickets** if:
     - They are **idle** and have **low queue length**.
2. **Automated Tier Swapping:**
   - If L1 queue > 10 tickets and L2 agent B12 is idle, **auto-promote a P4 ticket to B12**.

**Data Required:**
- Agent FCR history by skill.
- Real-time queue lengths.
- Ticket priority/SLA deadlines.

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Balanced workload** across tiers.
- **Reduced L2/L3 bottlenecks** by 45%.
- **Higher FCR for L1** (e.g., 65%  75%).

## **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**
### **A. Business Process Simulation (BPS)**
**Tools:** PM4Py, Disco, or BPMN simulators.
**Steps:**
1. **Model Current Process:**
   - Extract **process model** from event log (e.g., using *alpha-miner* or *HEARTEA*).
   - Identify **bottlenecks** (e.g., high reassignments at L1  L2).
2. **Simulate Proposed Strategies:**
   - **Strategy 1 (Skill-Based Routing):**
     - Run simulation with weighted skill assignments.
     - *Expected Outcome:* 30% fewer reassignments, 75% SLA compliance for P3.
   - **Strategy 2 (Workload-Aware):**
     - Simulate real-time queue adjustments.
     - *Expected Outcome:* L1 queue reduced by 30%, L2 idle time increased by 20%.
3. **Validation:**
   - Compare simulated metrics (e.g., TTR, FCR) with historical data.
   - Adjust weights/parameters until alignment is achieved.

### **B. Post-Implementation Monitoring**
**Key KPIs to Track (via Process Mining Dashboards):**
| **KPI**                          | **Tool**               | **Frequency**       |
