### **High-Level Process Step Aggregation from Low-Level Event Log**

Based on the provided event log and analysis of temporal, logical, and resource-based patterns across multiple cases (A1, B2), we identify **four coherent, higher-level manufacturing process steps**. These steps represent distinct phases in the production lifecycle of a metal component.

##  **Proposed High-Level Activities with Rationale and Grouping Justification**

---

### **1. Material Preparation & Pre-Processing**

**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet  
- Scan barcode  
- Place metal sheet on table  
- Align metal sheet  
- Preheat metal sheet  

**Rationale:**
- All events occur **sequentially and temporally close** (within ~2 minutes).
- Performed by **Operator A** (initial setup) and **Robot Arm #2** (alignment), followed by **Heating Unit #1** (preheating).
- These actions prepare the raw material for subsequent processing by ensuring correct positioning, identification, and thermal conditioning.
- The preheating step is critical for welding quality and is logically tied to preparation.
- The barcode scan confirms traceability and triggers downstream processes.

**Justification for Grouping:**
- This phase is **independent of assembly or quality checks** and focuses solely on transforming raw input into a ready-to-weld state.
- It forms a **self-contained initial stage** that must be completed before any joining or coating.

**Aggregated Step Name:**  
> **Material Preparation & Pre-Processing**

### **2. Assembly (Welding Operations)**

**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Pick up welding tool  
- Weld corner A  
- Weld corner B  

**Rationale:**
- All events are **performed by the same resource (Operator B)**.
- They occur in **tight temporal proximity** (within 10 seconds).
- The sequence is **action-driven**: tool pickup  execution of two welds.
- The welding tasks are **functionally related**—both are spot welds on the same component, likely forming structural joints.
- No other resources or intermediate steps intervene between tool pickup and welding.

**Justification for Grouping:**
- This represents a **focused, operator-driven assembly task**.
- It is distinct from material prep (different resource, different purpose) and quality checks (post-welding).
- The welding process is **complete** after both corners are welded, making it a logical unit.

**Aggregated Step Name:**  
> **Assembly (Welding Operations)**

### **3. Quality Inspection & Validation**

**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Measure weld integrity  
- Visual check  

**Rationale:**
- Both events occur **immediately after welding**, within ~10–15 seconds.
- **Quality Sensor #1** performs a **non-destructive measurement** (integrity score).
- **Operator C** performs a **manual visual inspection**.
- These checks are **complementary**: one automated (sensor), one human (visual).
- Both are **post-assembly quality gates**, ensuring welds meet standards before proceeding.

**Justification for Grouping:**
- These two checks are **sequential and logically grouped** as a single quality assurance phase.
- They are **not part of the assembly** (they follow it) and are **not part of coating** (they precede it).
- The integrity score and visual pass/fail are **both indicators of product acceptability**.

**Aggregated Step Name:**  
> **Quality Inspection & Validation**

### **4. Surface Coating & Curing**

**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Apply protective coating  
- Dry coating  

**Rationale:**
- Performed by **Coating Unit #3** and **Heating Unit #2**, respectively.
- The coating application is immediately followed by drying (within 15 seconds).
- Drying is a **necessary step** for curing the coating and ensuring durability.
- This phase is **distinct from welding and inspection** in both function and resources.
- It prepares the product for final handling or shipping.

**Justification for Grouping:**
- The coating and drying are **functionally linked**—drying is a required part of the coating process.
- They occur in **tight succession**, with no other process steps intervening.
- This forms a **final finishing stage** that completes the product’s surface treatment.

**Aggregated Step Name:**  
> **Surface Coating & Curing**

##  **Summary: High-Level Process Steps**

| High-Level Step | Description | Key Events Included | Resource Pattern | Temporal Cohesion |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Material Preparation & Pre-Processing** | Initial setup and conditioning of raw material | Retrieve, Scan, Place, Align, Preheat | Operator A  Robot Arm  Heating Unit | High (2 min) |
| **Assembly (Welding Operations)** | Structural joining of components | Pick up tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B | Operator B (single operator) | Very high (10 sec) |
| **Quality Inspection & Validation** | Post-assembly verification | Measure integrity, Visual check | Sensor  Operator C | High (15 sec) |
| **Surface Coating & Curing** | Final surface treatment and drying | Apply coating, Dry coating | Coating Unit  Heating Unit | High (15 sec) |

##  **Pattern Recognition & Generalization Rules**

To scale this grouping to the full event log, the following **rules can be applied**:

1. **Temporal Proximity:** Events within 1–2 minutes are likely part of the same phase.
2. **Resource Continuity:** Events performed by the same operator or machine type (e.g., welding tool  welding) are likely grouped.
3. **Functional Logic:** Actions that form a **cause-effect chain** (e.g., apply coating  dry) are grouped.
4. **Phase Boundaries:** 
   - Pre-processing  Assembly  Quality  Finishing
   - Each phase has a **clear input (material, tool, or prior stage)** and **output (ready for next stage)**.
5. **Triggers:** Events like barcode scan or integrity score often serve as **phase markers**.

##  **Conclusion**

By aggregating low-level events into these four high-level steps, we transform a granular, machine-readable log into a **clear, human-understandable manufacturing workflow**. This abstraction enables:

- Better process monitoring and bottleneck identification.
- Improved traceability and root cause analysis.
- Easier integration with BPMN or manufacturing execution systems (MES).
- Scalable analysis across thousands of cases.

This approach demonstrates how **temporal, functional, and resource-based clustering** can extract meaningful process structure from raw event data.
