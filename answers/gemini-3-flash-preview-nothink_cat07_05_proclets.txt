This image is a technical diagram illustrating the concept of "proclets" (process objects) and how they interact within a clinical laboratory workflow. It is divided into three sections: a process flow diagram, a class diagram, and an example table of a communication event.

### (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels
This main section uses a Petri net-style notation to show two parallel processes and their interactions.

*   **Lab visit process (Left):** This represents the patient's side of the workflow. 
    *   It begins with a **Doctor** performing **Order entry**.
    *   A **Lab assistant** then takes a **Blood sample**. This action triggers a message through the **Order system** channel to initiate the Lab test process.
    *   Later, the process reaches a **Judge results** step. Depending on the outcome, it branches: either "Everything fine" leads to **Send report**, or "Do tests again" triggers a request via the **HIS (Hospital Information System)** channel for a re-test.
*   **Lab test process (Right):** This represents the laboratory's internal workflow.
    *   Triggered by the Order system, a **Chemical analyst** performs the **Perform test** and **Make report** steps.
    *   The report is sent via the HIS channel back to the Lab visit process (**Receive result**).
    *   If the Lab visit process requests a re-test, the analyst performs **Perform test again** and **Provide updated report**, which is sent back to the Lab visit process (**Receive updated result**).
*   **Interaction Channels:** Two dashed boxes, **Order system** and **HIS**, act as intermediaries. The symbols within them (like `*, 1` and `1, 1`) represent cardinalities, indicating how many instances of one process relate to instances of the other through that communication point.

### (b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes
This is a simplified UML class diagram showing the structural relationship between the two main entities:
*   **Lab visit** has a "requires" relationship with **Lab test**.
*   **Multiplicity:** The diagram indicates that one "Lab visit" can require "1..*" (one or more) "Lab tests," while each "Lab test" is associated with exactly "1..1" "Lab visit."

### (c) Example of a performative
This table provides a concrete example of a single communication event (a "performative") between the two processes:
*   **Time:** 11:00
*   **Channel:** Order system
*   **Sender:** Lab visit - John (referring to a specific patient instance)
*   **Receivers:** Lab test - HGB John (a specific test instance for that patient)
*   **Action:** Create
*   **Content:** "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
*   **Scope/Direction:** Private / OUT (meaning it is an outgoing message from the Lab visit proclet).

In summary, the visualization explains how individual process instances (proclets) for patient visits and lab tests are structured, how they relate to one another, and the specific mechanism by which they communicate to complete a complex medical workflow.
