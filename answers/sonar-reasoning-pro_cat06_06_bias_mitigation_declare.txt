Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the existing DECLARE model structure and how to add new constraints to mitigate bias in the loan application process. 

The user provided an example DECLARE model as a Python dictionary. The keys are constraint types like "existence", "response", etc. For unary constraints like "existence", each activity is a key with a value containing support and confidence. For binary constraints like "response", each activity maps to another dictionary where the keys are target activities, each with their own support and confidence.

The task is to add new constraints that prevent bias based on sensitive attributes. So, I need to think about which DECLARE constraints can enforce fairness. Let's consider the examples given:

1. **Coexistence**: If a decision involves a sensitive attribute, ensure that a ManualReview is present. For example, if there's an Approve_Minority activity, it should coexist with ManualReview. This means both must occur in the trace if one does.

2. **Response/Succession Constraints**: Ensure that decisions like Approve or Reject can't happen immediately after checking a sensitive attribute without a BiasMitigationCheck. So, after CheckApplicantRace, there must be a BiasMitigationCheck before a Reject.

3. **Non-succession Constraints**: Prevent direct succession from CheckApplicantRace to Reject. Using "nonsuccession" would ensure that CheckApplicantRace is never directly followed by Reject.

Now, applying these to the given model:

- For coexistence: Add entries in the "coexistence" constraint. For each sensitive decision activity (like Approve_Minority), map it to ManualReview with support and confidence 1.0.

- For response constraints: In the "response" constraint, after CheckApplicantRace, require BiasMitigationCheck before any decision. So CheckApplicantRace responds to BiasMitigationCheck, and BiasMitigationCheck must precede decisions.

Wait, actually, maybe succession is better here. Because succession requires that if CheckApplicantRace occurs, then BiasMitigationCheck must follow, and vice versa? Or response would mean that every CheckApplicantRace must eventually be followed by BiasMitigationCheck.

But the goal is that before a decision like Approve or Reject happens after a sensitive check, there must be a mitigation step. So perhaps using precedence: the decision can't happen unless BiasMitigationCheck has occurred after the sensitive check.

Alternatively, using succession between CheckApplicantRace and BiasMitigationCheck, ensuring that if one occurs, the other must follow.

Hmm. Maybe using precedence for BiasMitigationCheck before decisions. So in the precedence constraint, map decisions like Approve and Reject to require that BiasMitigationCheck has occurred first.

Wait, precedence(a,b) means that b can only occur if a has occurred before. So if we want that before Approve or Reject can happen, BiasMitigationCheck must have occurred after a sensitive attribute check, maybe we need a chain of constraints.

Alternatively, for each sensitive attribute check (like CheckApplicantRace), add a response constraint that requires BiasMitigationCheck to follow. Then, add precedence constraints that decisions require BiasMitigationCheck.

But perhaps more straightforward:

- Add response constraints from each sensitive check (CheckApplicantRace, CheckApplicantAge) to BiasMitigationCheck. This ensures that whenever a sensitive attribute is checked, a mitigation check must follow.

- Add precedence constraints from BiasMitigationCheck to decision activities (Approve, Reject). This ensures that the mitigation check must occur before any decision.

Additionally, non-succession constraints can prevent direct transitions from sensitive checks to decisions. For example, in "nonsuccession", CheckApplicantRace should not be directly followed by Reject.

Putting this together:

1. **Coexistence Constraints**:
   - For each sensitive decision (Approve_Minority, Reject_Minority), add coexistence with ManualReview.
   - So in the "coexistence" section:
     "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
     "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},

2. **Response Constraints**:
   - For each sensitive check (CheckApplicantRace, CheckApplicantAge), add response to BiasMitigationCheck.
   - In "response":
     "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
     "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},

3. **Precedence Constraints**:
   - Decisions (Approve, Reject) must be preceded by BiasMitigationCheck.
   - In "precedence":
     "BiasMitigationCheck": {
         "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
         "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
     }

4. **Non-succession Constraints**:
   - Prevent direct succession from CheckApplicantRace to Reject/Approve.
   - In "nonsuccession":
     "CheckApplicantRace": {
         "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
         "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
     },
     Similarly for CheckApplicantAge.

Wait but nonsuccession means that if A occurs, B cannot occur later (anywhere after). To prevent immediate succession (A directly followed by B), perhaps chainprecedence or chainsuccession is needed? Or maybe nonchainsuccession?

Looking back at the DECLARE constraints listed: nonchainsuccession is a constraint where A cannot be immediately followed by B.

Yes! The user mentioned nonchainsuccession as one of the constraint types.

So for preventing direct succession from CheckApplicantRace to Reject or Approve:

In the "nonchainsuccession" section:

"CheckApplicantRace": {
    "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
},
"CheckApplicantAge": {
    "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
}

This would ensure that CheckApplicantRace cannot be immediately followed by Reject or Approve without an intermediate step like BiasMitigationCheck.

Additionally, adding existence for ManualReview and BiasMitigationCheck might be necessary if they are new activities not present in the original model.

Also need to ensure that these new activities are included in existence or other unary constraints if required.

Putting all this together into the declare_model structure.

```python
declare_model = {
    # Existing constraints retained from original model
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # New fairness-related activities added
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    # New coexistence constraints for demographic-specific decisions
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensures manual review accompanies sensitive demographic decisions
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Extend with other demographic dimensions as needed
    },
    # New response chain for bias checks
    "response": {
        # Requires mitigation after checking sensitive attributes
        **{sensitive_attr: {"BiasMitigationCheck":
            {"support:1."}}, 
            for sensitive_attr in ["CheckApplicantRace", 
                                 ]},
        # Original response constraint retained
        : {}}}}}
