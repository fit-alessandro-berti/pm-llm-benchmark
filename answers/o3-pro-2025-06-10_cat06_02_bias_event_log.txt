Where the bias shows up  

1. The only systematic score adjustment in the log is “+10 (Community)” that is granted when:  
   • LocalResident = TRUE and  
   • CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club.”  

   No other community or civic organisation is ever rewarded, and no negative adjustments are ever applied.  
    Attribute(s) involved: CommunityGroup, indirectly LocalResident (only locals appear to belong).  
    Effect: applicants who are members of that single club receive an automatic 10-point boost to the credit score that feeds the Rules Engine.

2. Threshold behaviour & disparate impact  

   • Empirically the Rules Engine is approving everybody with a final score  720, and is willing to approve as low as 700 if the 10-point community boost is present.  
   • Compare two borderline cases with essentially the same underlying creditworthiness:  
     – C003: 715 raw score, Non-local, No club  stays 715  Rejected.  
     – C004: 690 raw score, Local, Club member  690 + 10 = 700  Approved.  
    People without the favoured affiliation (or who live outside the locality) must reach a higher raw score to clear the decision threshold. This is a classic “double-standard” or unfair cut-off.

3. Proxy discrimination  

   • LocalResident is a geographic attribute that can correlate with race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, or even nationality.  
   • Membership in a specific darts club can proxy for gender (often male-dominated), age, income level, or cultural background.  
    Although neither “race” nor “gender” appears explicitly, the algorithm is very likely to create disparate impact on legally protected groups via these proxies.

4. Manual review reinforcement  

   • Every case is manually touched, yet none of the reviewers vetoed the 10-point privilege.  
   • That suggests human reviewers are either unaware of or complicit in perpetuating the bias (“automation bias” + “rubber-stamping”).

Why this matters for fairness and equity  

• Equal credit applicants are treated unequally merely because they do not belong to a particular local club.  
• Non-locals—or locals who belong to different community organisations—receive no uplift, undermining geographic and associative neutrality.  
• The practice violates common fairness definitions:  
  – Demographic or group parity (approval rates differ by locality/club).  
  – Equal opportunity (true-positive rate differs across groups once conditioned on creditworthiness).  

Recommendations (high-level)  

1. Remove or rigorously justify any score adjustment that cannot be tied to proven, race- and gender-neutral risk reduction.  
2. If community involvement is considered predictive, make the criterion broad, transparent and equally accessible (e.g., “volunteer hours in any registered nonprofit”) rather than a single club.  
3. Audit regularly for disparate impact across protected classes and proxies such as geography.  
4. Give manual reviewers authority and training to question or override questionable automated adjustments.  
5. Document and publish the adjustment policy so that applicants understand how to qualify, reducing information asymmetry.
