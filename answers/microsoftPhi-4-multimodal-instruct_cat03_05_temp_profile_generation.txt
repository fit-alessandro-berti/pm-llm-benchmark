The above temporal profile for the global supply chain process suggests that the businesses have quite tight mean processing times with some variability. For instance, the time between selecting a supplier and placing an order may typically last one week, but it can vary by roughly two days. Similarly, distribution from the warehouse to the destination may usually take one week but could last up to two weeks.

This estimate helps in identifying potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement within the process by revealing where the most significant variations occur, and it aids in forecasting and planning. It assists in determining if the constraints are due to standardized procedures, random variation, or specific context-dependent factors. Focusing on reducing the standard deviation could lead to more predictable and efficient operations.
