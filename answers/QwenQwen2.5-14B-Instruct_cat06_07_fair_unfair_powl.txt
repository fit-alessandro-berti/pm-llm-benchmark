Based on the provided description, we will define two POWL models using the given structure and format. Both models will reflect the hiring process steps but will differ in how they handle the cultural fit and affiliation check.

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model includes an XOR choice after the skill assessment, where applicants either go through a standard cultural fit evaluation or a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that provides a subtle advantage based on community affiliations.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions/activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = SilentTransition()
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for ensuring data completeness
loop_for_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# XOR Choice between Standard Cultural Fit Evaluation and Community Affiliation Check
xor_for_cultural_fit = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Constructing the main StrictPartialOrder model
root_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_for_data, SkillAssessment, xor_for_cultural_fit, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Adding edges to ensure proper sequence
root_unfairness.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_for_data)
root_unfairness.order.add_edge(loop_for_data, SkillAssessment)
root_unfairness.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_for_cultural_fit)
root_unfairness.order.add_edge(xor_for_cultural_fit, ManagerialReview)
root_unfairness.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model ensures that all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process, eliminating the XOR branch that provides selective advantages.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions/activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = SilentTransition()
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for ensuring data completeness
loop_for_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Constructing the main StrictPartialOrder model without unfairness
root_no_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_for_data, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Adding edges to ensure proper sequence
root_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_for_data)
root_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(loop_for_data, SkillAssessment)
root_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

These models effectively represent the hiring processes as described, with the first model highlighting a potential source of unfairness and the second model ensuring fairness by eliminating the community affiliation advantage.
