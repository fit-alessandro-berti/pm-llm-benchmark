Yes.  
In the fragment

    xor_local_check = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[D, skip])

the XOR means that only some traces will execute transition D (CheckLocalAffiliation); the others immediately continue with the rest of the process.  
If D is taken, “local affiliation” provides “a subtle score uplift”.  
Although the uplift is small and the group is not explicitly protected by law, this construct still embeds bias:

1. Unequal treatment for an extraneous attribute  
   • Two applicants who are identical on every financially relevant variable can leave the loop with different scores solely because one happens to be a local community member.  
   • That violates the basic fairness principle of “similar applicants  similar outcomes”.

2. Proxy discrimination  
   • Membership in a “local community group” is strongly correlated with geography, social network, language, and often—though unintentionally—race or ethnicity.  
   • The XOR therefore creates a proxy for protected classes; people from minority neighborhoods or recent immigrants will systematically be routed to “skip” while long-established, majority-group residents more often take D and receive the uplift.  
   • Even if the rule never looks at race explicitly, the disparate impact doctrine (ECOA, FHA, GDPR Art. 22, etc.) can still be violated.

3. Cumulative advantage  
   • The uplift is applied before ManualReview (E) and FinalDecision (F). In borderline cases it can be the single factor that changes an “accept/prime terms” into a “reject/sub-prime terms” outcome.  
   • Repeating this over thousands of applications shifts aggregate approval rates and interest-rate spreads in favor of the affiliated group.

4. Lack of transparency and contestability  
   • Because the branch is silent to the applicant, those disadvantaged by “skip” cannot contest the decision or supply evidence that they too belong to a relevant community.

Practical implications

• Fair-lending risk: Regulators examine whether any step gives “an unlawful preference or a negative disparate impact”. A local-affiliation bonus can fail statistical-parity or equal-opportunity tests once data are stratified by protected class.  
• Reputational risk: News that “hometown” membership quietly helps you get a cheaper loan undermines trust and can trigger public criticism.  
• Ethical risk: The firm leaks societal advantage to a group that is already better positioned (network resources, information, mobility) while those needing credit access the most receive no corresponding compensating factor.

Mitigation options

1. Remove the XOR and let everyone follow the same path, or make D a data-collection step with no scoring effect.  
2. If the business insists on rewarding local ties, convert it into a transparent, formally defined feature (“distance  30 km of branch”) and validate that it does not create statistically significant disparate impact.  
3. Perform fairness testing:  
   • Compare approval, pricing, and error rates across protected classes with and without the uplift.  
   • Use counterfactual fairness or propensity-score matching to estimate how much of the outcome difference is attributable to the branch.  
4. Offer an alternative route to earn the same uplift (e.g., verified steady employment in the service area) so that the benefit is not exclusively tied to community-group membership.  
5. Disclose the factor to applicants and allow them to self-identify qualifying evidence.

In short, the XOR branch embeds a seemingly innocuous rule that can systematically tilt the process in favor of applicants who resemble the bank’s traditional customer base. Even though the uplift concerns a “non-legally protected” characteristic, it can still undermine fairness, draw regulatory scrutiny, and entrench social inequities unless it is redesigned or carefully audited.
