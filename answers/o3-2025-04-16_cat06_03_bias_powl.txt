Why the XOR branch is problematic

1. Semantics of the branch  
   • Path 1  (C  D  E): “CheckLocalAffiliation” is executed and, according to the comment in the code, gives the application a “subtle score uplift”.  
   • Path 2  (C  skip  E): the affiliation check is not performed; the uplift is therefore never granted.

   All applicants reach the same endstate (ManualReview  FinalDecision), but the amount of creditworthiness that is carried into those activities differs depending on which path was taken.

2. Who gets routed to D?  
   In practice only applicants that are (a) residents of the bank’s locality and (b) members of a “known community group” will satisfy the guard that sends the case through D.  
   • Neither “local resident” nor “community group member” is a protected characteristic under fairlending laws.  
   • Nevertheless, both properties are often strongly correlated with protected attributes such as race, ethnicity, national origin, or socioeconomic class.  
   • Membership in recognised local groups also presupposes a certain degree of social capital that recent immigrants, young borrowers, gigworkers, etc. are less likely to possess.

3. Resulting bias

   Direct discrimination?No: the model never checks race or gender explicitly.  
   Indirect (proxy) discrimination?Yes: the proxy “local affiliation” partially encodes protected information and leads to consistently better outcomes for applicants who pass through D.

   • Uplift leads to higher preliminary scores, which increases the probability that the underwriter in step E will approve the loan or will do so on better terms.  
   • Applicants who do not qualify for D start ManualReview with a lower score and therefore face a higher rejection rate or higher interest margins.

4. Equity impact

   • Disparate impact.  If the routing rule pushes a noticeably higher proportion of, say, majorityrace, longterm residents through D and keeps minority or immigrant applicants in the skip branch, the lender risks violating the “effects test” in fairlending examinations (ECOA/Reg B, FHA in the US, similar regulations elsewhere).  
   • Feedback loop.  Receiving better terms makes it easier for the advantaged group to build wealth, reinforcing the very correlations that justified giving the uplift in the first place.  
   • Transparency deficit.  Because the uplift is hidden behind an XOR branch, the decision explanation shown to the applicant (“manual review found you borderline”) may mask the true source of disadvantage.

5. Why “nonprotected” preferences still matter

   Regulators do not limit their scrutiny to explicitly protected features; they also examine facially neutral criteria that disproportionately harm protected classes without adequate business justification.  Courts have repeatedly held that “local residency”, “zip code”, and “membership in certain organisations” can constitute illegal redlining when they function as race or ethnicity proxies.

6. Good practice guidelines

   • Test for disparate impact: measure approval/interestrate gaps between protected groups with and without the affiliation uplift.  
   • Sensitivity analysis: reroute all applicants through skip and quantify outcome changes.  
   • Explainability: document the business necessity of the uplift (e.g., proven lower default rate for affiliated borrowers) and assess whether the same risk reduction can be achieved with a feature that is less correlated with protected traits.  
   • Mitigation options:  
     – Remove D or assign an equivalent uplift to everyone who passes DataValidation.  
     – Replace the binary XOR with a continuous risk signal that has been debiased.  
     – Require that any uplift feature pass a “fourfifths” disparateimpact test before deployment.

Conclusion

The XOR branch embeds a seemingly innocuous “local affiliation” advantage that, through correlation with protected characteristics, systematically tilts the playing field. Unless justified by demonstrably large and legitimate risk differences—and unless its impact is continuously monitored—the construct threatens the fairness, legality, and public trustworthiness of the loanapproval process.
