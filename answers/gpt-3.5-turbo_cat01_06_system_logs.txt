**Explanation:**

In this event log, each case represents a distinct task or document that the user interacts with. The events in each case are grouped together based on logical breakpoints such as switching applications, saving documents, or closing windows.

For activity naming, I focused on higher-level actions that capture the essence of each step. For example, "Typing Draft intro paragraph" represents the user inputting content into the document, while "Switch to Email - Inbox" indicates a change in focus to a different application.

The event log provides a structured sequence of activities for each case, allowing for analysis of the user's workflow and time spent on different tasks. This format enables process mining tools to uncover patterns, bottlenecks, and potential improvements in the user's work processes.
