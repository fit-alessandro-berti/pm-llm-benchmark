## Step 1: Identify the anomalies in the given POWL model
The given POWL model contains several anomalies:
1. **Loop between Evaluate Claim (E) and Approve Claim (P):** This could lead to repeated evaluation and approval, potentially causing delays or inefficiencies.
2. **XOR that may skip Notify Customer (N):** This allows for the possibility of not notifying the customer, which could be against regulatory or business requirements.
3. **Partial ordering that enables closing the claim prematurely:** The edge from `A` (Assign Adjuster) to `C` (Close Claim) suggests that a claim can be closed after assigning an adjuster, potentially before evaluation or approval.

## Step 2: Generate hypotheses on why these anomalies might exist
Possible reasons for these anomalies include:
1. **Changes in business rules:** Partial implementation of new rules might have led to incomplete or inconsistent process updates.
2. **Miscommunication between departments:** Different understandings of the process among stakeholders could result in design flaws.
3. **Technical errors in the workflow system:** System glitches or misconfigurations might allow non-standard paths.
4. **Inadequate constraints in the process modeling tool:** The tool might not enforce best practices or allow overly flexible process designs.

## Step 3: Propose database queries to verify hypotheses
To verify these hypotheses, we can write SQL queries against the `claims`, `adjusters`, and `claim_events` tables.

### Query 1: Claims closed without proper evaluation or approval
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE c.claim_id NOT IN (
    SELECT ce.claim_id
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.activity IN ('Evaluate Claim', 'Approve Claim')
)
AND c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT ce.claim_id
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.activity = 'Close Claim'
);
```

### Query 2: Claims approved multiple times
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id, COUNT(ce.event_id) as approval_count
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity = 'Approve Claim'
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(ce.event_id) > 1;
```

### Query 3: Frequency of skipped customer notification
```sql
WITH notification_status AS (
    SELECT ce.claim_id,
    CASE
        WHEN EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM claim_events ce2
            WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'Notify Customer'
        ) THEN 'Notified'
        ELSE 'Not Notified'
    END as notification_status
    FROM claim_events ce
    GROUP BY ce.claim_id
)
SELECT notification_status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM notification_status
GROUP BY notification_status;
```

## Step 4: Interpret the results of the queries
By executing these queries, we can determine:
1. If claims are being closed without evaluation or approval.
2. The frequency of multiple approvals for a single claim.
3. How often customer notification is skipped.

These insights can help validate the hypotheses about the anomalies in the POWL model and guide further investigation or corrective actions.

The final answer is: 
There is no single numerical answer for this problem as it involves identifying anomalies, generating hypotheses, and proposing SQL queries to verify these hypotheses against a database. The solution involves a qualitative analysis and query proposals as described.
