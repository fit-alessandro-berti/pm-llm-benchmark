### Proposed High-Level Activities and Groupings

**1. Material Preparation**  
- **Low-Level Events Included:**  
  - Retrieve raw metal sheet  
  - Scan barcode  
  - Place metal sheet on table  
  - Align metal sheet  
  - Preheat metal sheet  

- **Rationale:**  
  These events represent the initial setup and preparation of raw materials. They involve retrieving the part, verifying it via barcode, positioning it for processing, aligning it for precision, and preheating it for subsequent operations. The steps are performed in quick succession (temporal proximity) and involve both human operators (e.g., Operator A) and automated systems (Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1), indicating a distinct preparatory phase.  

- **Resource Involvement:**  
  Operator A (manual handling), Robot Arm #2 (alignment automation), Heating Unit #1 (thermal preparation).

**2. Component Assembly and Welding**  
- **Low-Level Events Included:**  
  - Pick up welding tool  
  - Weld corner A  
  - Weld corner B  
  - Measure weld integrity  

- **Rationale:**  
  This group focuses on assembling the product by welding critical joints and immediately verifying weld quality. The sequence starts with tool pickup, proceeds with two welding actions (logical continuity), and ends with an automated quality check. These steps are tightly coupled (temporal proximity and shared purpose) and performed by Operator B and Quality Sensor #1, indicating a dedicated assembly phase.  

- **Resource Involvement:**  
  Operator B (manual welding), Quality Sensor #1 (automated quality check).

**3. Protective Coating Application**  
- **Low-Level Events Included:**  
  - Apply protective coating  
  - Dry coating  

- **Rationale:**  
  These steps involve applying a protective layer to the assembled product and curing it. The coating and drying steps are interdependent (coating must be dried to set) and executed by specialized equipment (Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2). This represents a distinct post-assembly surface treatment phase.  

- **Resource Involvement:**  
  Coating Unit #3 (application automation), Heating Unit #2 (thermal curing).  

---

**4. Final Quality Inspection**  
- **Low-Level Events Included:**  
  - Visual check  

- **Rationale:**  
  A final human-led inspection ensures the product meets visual standards before completion. While brief, this step is critical for quality assurance and occurs after all other processing steps, marking the end of the workflow.  

- **Resource Involvement:**  
  Operator C (manual inspection).

### Summary of Grouping Logic  
1. **Sequential Workflow Stages:** Groupings reflect the natural progression of manufacturing (preparation → assembly → coating → inspection).  
2. **Resource Consistency:** Activities performed by the same resource type (e.g., Operator B for welding) are grouped.  
3. **Logical Continuity:** Steps that depend on each other (e.g., coating followed by drying) are bundled.  
4. **Temporal Proximity:** Events occurring in quick succession (e.g., material retrieval to preheating) are merged.  

This structure simplifies process analysis by abstracting granular events into domain-relevant phases.
