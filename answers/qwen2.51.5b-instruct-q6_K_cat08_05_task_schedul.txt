### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

#### Process Mining Techniques and Metrics

**Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
- **Activity Duration Analysis:** Use process mining tools to analyze average task durations across all jobs. Compare job completion times (makespans) over time using KPIs like median makespan, maximum makespan, and standard deviation.
- **Lead Time Distribution:** Identify common lead times for various operations by quantifying the duration of each operation from start-to-finish and calculating median and 95th percentile values.

**Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):**
- **Queue Length Analysis:** Use event logs to track average queue lengths at critical work centers over time. Calculate waiting times, including setup waiting times.
- **Average Queue Time:** Identify typical waiting periods for tasks in the queue by calculating the mean and variance of queueing times.

**Resource Utilization:**
- **Productive vs. Idle Times:** Measure total productive and idle time per machine or operator over a month using process mining metrics like total hours worked, scheduled vs. actual work performed.
- **Setup Time Variability:** Analyze how setups are distributed among machines by examining average setup times and variations.

**Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Use sequence-dependent setup time estimation models to calculate expected setup durations based on the order in which tasks were processed. This can be done through regression analysis or simulation techniques.
  - Example: Fit a simple linear model `Setup Time = k * Task Duration + b` where k and b are constants derived from historical data.

**Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
- **Deviation Metrics:** Define metrics like tardy job count, average tardiness, maximum tardiness, and frequency of delays. Use process mining to identify patterns or anomalies in task completion times.
  - Example: Implement a lag time metric that calculates the difference between actual and scheduled completion times for each job.

**Impact of Disruptions (Breakdowns, Urgent Jobs):**
- **Disruption Analysis:** Quantify how disruptions affect scheduling performance using metrics like average disruption duration and its impact on overall schedule adherence.
  - Example: Use process mining to identify sequences where a breakdown occurred near the end of a critical job flow or when an urgent task was delayed.

#### Process Mining Insights

- **Resource Contention Periods:** Identify periods of high resource contention by analyzing event logs for long queue lengths and idle times. This can help prioritize tasks based on their impact.
- **Sequence-dependent Setup Analysis:** Use historical data to identify sequences where setup times are disproportionately longer due to specific operations or job characteristics (e.g., similar tasks grouped together).

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

#### Identifying Key Pathologies

**Bottleneck Resources:**
- **Identify Bottlenecks:** Examine machine and operator utilization patterns over time using process mining metrics.
  - Example: Machine utilization rates, idle times, break-even points for each resource.

**Poor Task Prioritization:**
- **High-Priority Job Delayed:** Analyze the frequency of high-priority jobs being delayed due to insufficient resources or long wait times at work centers.
  - Example: Calculate delay metrics like percentage of high-priority tasks not completed on time and use this data for prioritization adjustments.

**Suboptimal Sequencing:**
- **Sequence Dependent Setup Analysis:** Investigate how sequence-dependent setups affect task execution times by examining average setup durations per operation type.
  - Example: Create a model to predict setup duration based on job characteristics, then adjust sequencing algorithms accordingly.

**Resource Starvation:**
- **Identify Starved Resources:** Detect situations where downstream resources (e.g., milling machines) are underutilized or starved due to upstream scheduling decisions.
  - Example: Use process mining to identify sequences where the next operation cannot be completed because of a bottleneck and adjust the order accordingly.

**Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:**
- **WIP Variation:** Identify periods when WIP levels spike, indicating inefficient use of resources or unexpected disruptions.
  - Example: Track lead times for different job types to identify which operations are causing excess inventory.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis

#### Potential Root Causes

**Limited Scheduling Logic:**
- **Inadequate Dynamic Rules:** Existing dispatching rules may not adapt well to sudden changes in workload or unforeseen disruptions.
  - Example: Static priority-based scheduling does not handle unplanned breakdowns effectively.

**Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
- **Static Task Durations:** Incorrect assumptions about task durations, especially if historical data is inaccurate or biased (e.g., operator inefficiencies).
  - Example: Use process mining to validate and update duration estimates for critical tasks based on actual performance.

**Inaccurate Duration Estimations:**
- **Setup Time Models:** Failure to accurately model setup times can lead to inefficient resource allocation.
  - Example: Apply machine learning models to predict setup times based on historical data, then fine-tune these models using process mining results.

**Lack of Effective Scheduling Logic for Sequences:**
- **Sequence Dependent Setup Analysis:** Ignoring sequence-dependent setup requirements in scheduling algorithms can lead to long wait times or overutilization.
  - Example: Use event logs to derive and implement a heuristic that predicts average setup time based on sequence characteristics.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

#### Strategy Proposals

**Enhanced Dispatching Rules (Strategy 1):**
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Implement rules that adjust resource allocation based on remaining processing time, task due dates, and operator capabilities.
  - Example: Use a linear model `Setup Time = k * Task Duration + b` to predict setup times for each operation type, then use this information to optimize scheduling decisions.

**Predictive Scheduling (Strategy 2):**
- **Real-Time Setup Estimation:** Leverage historical task duration distributions and predictive maintenance insights to generate realistic schedules.
  - Example: Use process mining to derive a distribution of typical setup times based on job characteristics, then adjust actual durations in real-time using data from the MES.

**Setup Time Optimization (Strategy 3):**
- **Batch Similar Jobs:** Group similar jobs together to minimize sequence-dependent setup times at bottleneck machines.
  - Example: Implement an algorithm that categorizes jobs by complexity and operational requirements, then batches them to reduce waiting time between operations.

#### Detailed Logic

- **Enhanced Dispatching Rules:**
  ```python
  def adjust_resource_allocation(job):
      # Calculate remaining processing time for current operation
      available_time = job.machinerecords[-1].total_time - job.execution_duration
      # Predict setup times using historical data and operator capabilities
      predicted_setup_times = predict_setup_time(job, available_time)
      # Adjust allocation based on predicted times and task priorities
  ```

- **Predictive Scheduling:**
  ```python
  def generate_realistic_schedule(tasks):
      # Derive setup time distribution from historical data
      setup_distribution = derive_setup_distribution(tasks, job_machinerrecords, machine_loads)
      # Adjust durations in real-time using this distribution and predictive models
  ```

- **Setup Time Optimization:**
  ```python
  def batch_similar_jobs(job1, job2):
      similar_operations = find_similar_operations(job1.operations, job2.operations)
      for operation in similar_operations:
          process_records[job1] += record(operation.duration)
          process_records[job2] += record(operation.duration)
          # Reduce setup times between operations if they are batched
  ```

#### Evaluation Framework

- **Discrete-Event Simulation:**
  - Parameterize simulation with historical data, including task durations and resource utilization.
  - Integrate process mining insights to validate model assumptions and identify areas for improvement.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:**
  - Use process mining to track KPIs over time, identifying drifts or new inefficiencies.
  - Automatically adjust scheduling algorithms based on these observations through an adaptive learning mechanism.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

#### Simulation Framework

**Discrete-Event Simulation:**

```python
def simulate_scheduling(scheduler, tasks):
    # Initialize simulation parameters (e.g., random number generator)
    rng = np.random.default_rng()
    
    for task in tasks:
        job = scheduler.schedule(task)
        while not job.is_completed():
            # Process events based on current state and task dependencies
            event = event_records.pop(0)  # Pop the next event from the queue
            process(event, job)  # Execute event
            
            if job is None:  # Reached an idle operation
                break
    
    return job.makespan, job.queue_time, ...
```

**Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:**

- **KPI Tracking:** Continuously monitor KPIs like tardiness, WIP, lead time, utilization.
- **Adaptive Learning Mechanism:** Use process mining insights to update scheduling algorithms in real-time. This could involve adjusting heuristic parameters or modifying task sequencing rules based on observed performance patterns.
