Based on the normative process description, I'll analyze each case to identify violations:

## Analysis of Cases:

### **Case 1: COMPLIANT **
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

This case follows the expected flow perfectly for the sufficient inventory scenario. All activities occur in the correct order with proper dependencies maintained.

### **Case 2: VIOLATION **
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items  Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** Package items occurs before Authorize payment
- The normative description explicitly states: "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping"
- This case packages items at 10:00 but doesn't authorize payment until 10:30, violating the requirement that payment authorization must precede packaging

### **Case 3: MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS **
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Cancel order  Ship order**  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **Illogical flow**: The order is canceled after payment authorization, which suggests a process inconsistency
2. **Critical violation**: Ship order occurs after Cancel order
   - The normative description explicitly states: "Ship order should... never after a cancellation"
   - Once an order is canceled, no fulfillment activities (shipping) should follow
   - The description notes it would be "illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)" after cancellation

### **Case 4: COMPLIANT **
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

This case follows the expected flow perfectly for the insufficient inventory scenario. The order is properly canceled after inventory check and immediately closed without any fulfillment activities.

### **Case 5: VIOLATION **
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violation:** Missing Package items activity
- The normative description establishes that packaging must occur before shipping: "Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'"
- This case jumps directly from payment authorization to shipping at 11:00, bypassing the required packaging step
- This violates the fundamental principle that items must be prepared for shipment before they can be shipped

## Summary:
- **Compliant cases:** 1, 4
- **Non-compliant cases:** 2, 3, 5
  - Case 2: Incorrect ordering (packaging before payment authorization)
  - Case 3: Shipping after cancellation (fundamental violation)
  - Case 5: Missing required activity (packaging before shipping)
