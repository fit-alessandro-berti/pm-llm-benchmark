### Notes:
- **Assumptions Made**:
  - The "Order Created" event is derived from the `order_date` in the `Orders` table.
  - "Items Picked" events are derived from the `item_picking_date` in the `Order Lines` table.
  - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events are based on the `delivery_dispatch_date` and `delivery_arrival_date` in the `Delivery` table.
  - "Invoice Issued" is based on the `invoice_issue_date` in the `Invoice` table.
  - "Payment Received" is based on the `payment_date` in the `Payments` table.
- **Resources**: Mapped using the `Resources` table for clarity.
- **Chronological Order**: Events are ordered based on timestamps to reflect the real process flow.

This event log is now ready for process mining analysis.
