Here's a comprehensive plan for analyzing Speedy Parcels' operations using process mining, designed to improve delivery punctuality and reduce operational costs.

**1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking:**

*   **Data Preprocessing and Integration:**

    *   **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** The raw data from each source will likely have different formats, data types, and levels of granularity. This requires a thorough cleaning and transformation process.
        *   **Timestamp Standardization:** Ensure consistent timestamp formats across all sources.
        *   **Location Data Processing:** Standardize location coordinates (latitude/longitude) and potentially enrich the data with geographical information like postal codes, street addresses, and proximity to landmarks. Consider using a geocoding service.
        *   **Data Type Conversion:** Convert categorical variables (e.g., vehicle status) and numerical variables (e.g., speed) to appropriate data types.

    *   **Data Integration:** Linking records from different sources is critical. The 'Case ID' (Vehicle-Day) provides a starting point, but other fields require careful matching and potentially fuzzy matching techniques.
        *   **Activity Definition:** Define clear and consistent activity names across all data sources. For example, "Arrive Customer" in the scanner data should align with the time a vehicle stops near a customer location based on GPS data.
        *   **Event Correlation:** Use timestamp proximity and location data to link GPS events (e.g., stopping at a location) with scanner events (e.g., delivery success at the same location). Establish rules for matching events within acceptable time and distance thresholds.
        *   **Handling Missing Data:** Address missing data (e.g., missing GPS coordinates or scanner data). Imputation techniques (e.g., using averages or interpolation) or exclusion of incomplete cases might be necessary, depending on the completeness of the data.

    *   **Challenges:**
        *   **Data Quality Issues:** Inconsistent data formats, missing values, and inaccurate timestamps are common challenges. Data validation and cleaning routines are crucial.
        *   **Data Volume:** Processing large volumes of GPS data can be computationally intensive. Data aggregation and sampling techniques might be needed.
        *   **Privacy Concerns:** Anonymization or pseudonymization of driver and customer data may be required to comply with privacy regulations.
        *   **Complex Event Relationships:** Accurately linking events across different systems can be complex due to timing discrepancies and potential data loss.

*   **Process Discovery:**

    *   **Algorithm Selection:** Apply process discovery algorithms like:
        *   **Alpha Algorithm:** Simple and fast, but may struggle with complex processes containing loops and parallel activities.
        *   **Heuristic Miner:** More robust than the Alpha algorithm and can handle noise and incompleteness in the event log.
        *   **Inductive Miner:** Handles complex processes better by automatically simplifying models.
        *   **Directly Follows Graph:** A basic technique ideal for initial exploration and understanding process flow.

    *   **Visualization:** Visualize the discovered process model as a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram or similar. This will illustrate the typical sequence of activities (e.g., Depart Depot -> Arrive Customer -> Delivery Success -> Depart Customer) and their variants (e.g., failed deliveries, traffic delays, maintenance stops).
    *   **Abstraction and Filtering:** Adjust the level of detail by aggregating activities (e.g., grouping several delivery stops into a single activity) or filtering out infrequent variants to improve readability.

*   **Conformance Checking:**

    *   **Planned Route Extraction:** Extract the planned routes and delivery sequences for each vehicle from the dispatch system. Represent these as process models (e.g., BPMN).
    *   **Conformance Metrics:** Compare the discovered process model (actual process) against the planned routes using conformance checking techniques and metrics. Examples:
        *   **Token-Based Replay:** Simulate the execution of the event log on the planned process model to identify deviations.
        *   **Alignment:** Find the optimal alignment between the event log and the planned model, highlighting deviations as insertions, deletions, or substitutions of activities.
    *   **Deviation Analysis:** Focus on specific types of deviations:
        *   **Sequence Deviations:** Activities occurring in a different order than planned. This might indicate suboptimal route planning or unexpected events.
        *   **Unplanned Stops:** Stops at locations not included in the planned route. Investigate the reasons for these stops (e.g., driver errands, unexpected traffic delays, emergency maintenance).
        *   **Timing Differences:** Significant differences between the planned and actual duration of activities or the overall delivery time. This can highlight delays due to traffic, inefficient delivery practices, or customer-related issues.
        *   **Missing Activities:** Activities that were planned but did not occur. This might indicate dropped deliveries or route changes.

**2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification:**

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

    *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of deliveries completed within the customer-specified time window. Calculation: (Number of on-time deliveries / Total deliveries) * 100. Requires time window data from the Dispatch System and the 'Delivery Success' timestamp from the Scanner data.
    *   **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** The average time spent at each customer location, including travel time to the stop. Calculation: Total time spent at delivery stops / Number of delivery stops. Requires 'Arrive Customer' and 'Depart Customer' timestamps.
    *   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** The ratio of time spent traveling between delivery stops to time spent at customer locations (service time). Calculation: (Total travel time / Total service time). Requires GPS data to infer travel time and 'Arrive Customer' and 'Depart Customer' timestamps for service time.
    *   **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Fuel consumed per kilometer per package delivered. Calculation: Total fuel consumed / (Total distance traveled * Number of packages delivered). Requires fuel consumption data (if available) or estimation based on vehicle type and distance traveled (from GPS).
    *   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** The percentage of time a vehicle is actively used for deliveries. Calculation: (Total time delivering packages / Total shift time) * 100.  Requires 'Start Shift', 'End Shift' timestamps from driver log and timestamps from Scanner and GPS.
    *   **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:** The number of times vehicles experience significant slowdowns due to traffic and the duration of those delays. Calculation: Identify periods of low speed (e.g., below a threshold) from GPS data and calculate the frequency and duration of these periods.
    *   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Percentage of delivery attempts that result in failure. Calculation: (Number of failed deliveries / Total delivery attempts) * 100.  Requires 'Delivery Failed' and 'Delivery Success' timestamps.
    *   **First-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of packages delivered on the first delivery attempt.  Calculation: (Number of packages delivered on first attempt / Total number of packages) * 100.  Requires linking package ID to multiple 'Delivery Failed' events before 'Delivery Success' events.
    *   **Distance Variance from Planned Routes:** Average percentage increase in travel distance compared to planned routes.  Calculation: ((Actual Distance Traveled - Planned Route Distance) / Planned Route Distance) * 100, averaged across all cases.

*   **Bottleneck Identification:**

    *   **Performance Spectrum Analysis:** Visualize the distribution of activity durations (e.g., 'Arrive Customer' to 'Depart Customer' time) across different vehicles, routes, drivers, or time periods. This helps identify activities with high variability and potential bottlenecks.
