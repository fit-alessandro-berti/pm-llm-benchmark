### Analysis of the Event Log

#### 1. Violations of Normative Rules

**Case 2:**
- **Violation 1:** The **Risk Assessment** activity (2024-01-11 08:20) occurred before the **Credit Check** (2024-01-11 08:20). This violates the normative rule that the credit check must occur before the risk assessment.
- **Violation 2:** The **Finalize Documentation** activity (2024-01-11 10:00) occurred after the loan was **Rejected** (2024-01-11 09:30). This violates the normative rule that documentation should only be finalized if the loan is approved.

#### 2. Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions

**Case 3:**
- **Desideratum Violation 1:** The **Credit Check** (2024-01-14 10:00) occurred more than 24 hours after the **Application Received** (2024-01-12 09:00). This is not strictly a violation but is suboptimal.
- **Desideratum Violation 2:** The **Inform Applicant** activity (2024-01-16 15:00) occurred more than 48 hours after the **Loan Decision (Approved)** (2024-01-14 12:00). This is suboptimal but not a normative violation.
- **Desideratum Violation 3:** There was no **Follow-up Call** recorded in the log. While not a critical issue, it is a deviation from the recommended practice.

#### 3. Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors

**Case 2:**
- The sequence **Risk Assessment** occurring before **Credit Check** might indicate a possible error in the process or a deliberate bypass, which could be investigated further to understand the circumstances.
- The **Finalize Documentation** activity after the loan was rejected could be a procedural mistake that should be corrected to ensure compliance with the normative rules.

**Case 3:**
- The extended period between **Application Received** and **Credit Check** could be due to delays in processing or resource constraints. This could be addressed by optimizing the process or increasing resources.
- The delay in informing the applicant might be due to administrative delays or a backlog in processing. Improving the workflow and ensuring timely communication could help.
- The lack of a **Follow-up Call** might indicate a process oversight. Implementing a reminder system or ensuring follow-up calls are part of the standard procedure could address this.

### Summary

- **Case 2** is the only case that violates normative rules, with significant issues in sequence and procedural integrity.
- **Case 3** does not violate normative rules but fails to meet the recommended conditions for optimal processing, which suggests areas for improvement but not critical non-compliance.
- The identified issues can be addressed by reviewing and enforcing strict adherence to the normative sequence and by optimizing the process to meet the desiderata conditions.
