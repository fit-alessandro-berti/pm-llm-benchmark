**Merged Event Log:** (Format: `timestamp, event_name, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes`)

1. `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z,Order Received,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Event captured at warehouse system"`
   - Merged from Log A's "Order Received" and Log B's "OrderReceived". Timestamps are within the 2-second tolerance, and the event names are semantically similar.

2. `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z,Order Validated,Order#1234,u12,r10,"Cross-check inventory"`
   - Merged from Log A's "Order Validated" and Log B's "OrderValidation". Timestamps are within the 2-second tolerance, and the event names reflect the same process.

3. `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z,Payment Processed,Order#1234,u12,r99,"Payment gateway delay"`
   - Merged from Log A's "Payment Processed" and Log B's "PaymentCheck". Timestamps are within the 2-second tolerance, and the event names indicate the same activity.

4. `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z,Quality Check,Order#1234,u45,r11,"Random inspection"`
   - This event is unique to Log B. It does not have a corresponding event in Log A, so it is included as-is.

5. `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z,Item Shipped,Order#1234,,,`
   - This event is unique to Log A. It does not have a corresponding event in Log B, so it is included as-is, with missing attributes from Log B left blank.

6. `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z,Item Shipped,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Package handed to courier"`
   - This event is unique to Log B. It does not have a corresponding event in Log A within the 2-second tolerance, so it is included as-is. The event name is considered semantically similar to the "Item Shipped" event in Log A, but the timestamps are not close enough to merge.

7. `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z,Item Delivered,Order#1234,,,`
   - This event is unique to Log A. It does not have a corresponding event in Log B, so it is included as-is, with missing attributes from Log B left blank.

**Reasoning:**

Events were matched based on a combination of order_id and timing, with a 2-second tolerance for timestamp differences. If two events appeared to represent the same occurrence (based on semantically similar event names and close timestamps), they were merged into a single record. All attributes from both logs were included for merged events, and primary timestamps were chosen based on Log A.

For events that could not be confidently matched, they were left separate and included as-is. This was the case for Log A's "Item Shipped" and "Item Delivered" events, as well as Log B's "Quality Check" and "Shipping" events.

The "Shipping" event in Log B was not merged with the "Item Shipped" event in Log A, despite semantic similarity, because the timestamps were not close enough. This decision was made to maintain the integrity of the individual logs and avoid potential confusion.
