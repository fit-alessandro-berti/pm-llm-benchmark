Below is a compact, self-contained POWL description that reproduces every behaviour observed in the five example cases.

Python-like “construction” code is shown only to make the structure explicit – no execution is required.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator         # only XOR and LOOP are needed

# 1. Atomic activities (ordinary transitions)
OR   = Transition(label="OR")    # Order Received
MS   = Transition(label="MS")    # Material Sourcing
QS   = Transition(label="QS")    # Quality Screening
AS   = Transition(label="AS")    # Assembly
IQC  = Transition(label="IQC")   # In-line Quality Check
TST  = Transition(label="TST")   # Testing
RT   = Transition(label="RT")    # Re-Testing
PK   = Transition(label="PK")    # Packaging
LB   = Transition(label="LB")    # Labeling
DP   = Transition(label="DP")    # Distribution Planning
D    = Transition(label="D")     # Dispatch

# 2. Silent transition for the “skip-labeling” path
skip = SilentTransition()        # 

# 3. Control-flow operators
#    3a. Loop “assemble  ( 0 or more times: IQC  assemble )”
assembly_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[AS, IQC]           # A = AS (loop body), B = IQC (redo-part)
)

#    3b. Loop “test  ( 0 or more times: RT  test )”
testing_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[TST, RT]           # A = TST, B = RT
)

#    3c. Optional labeling: XOR(LB, )
labeling_xor = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[LB, skip]          # exclusive choice LB or skip
)

# 4. Strict partial order that stitches everything together
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        OR, MS, QS,
        assembly_loop,
        testing_loop,
        PK,
        labeling_xor,
        DP, D
    ]
)

# 5. Ordering edges (all other pairs are concurrent by definition – here everything is serial)
root.order.add_edge(OR,  MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS,  QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS,  assembly_loop)
root.order.add_edge(assembly_loop, testing_loop)
root.order.add_edge(testing_loop, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK,  labeling_xor)
root.order.add_edge(labeling_xor, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP,  D)
```

Interpretation of the model
1. OR  MS  QS : the start-up preparation sequence appears identically in every trace.  
2. assembly_loop = *(AS, IQC):  
   • Execute Assembly once.  
   • Then either leave the loop or perform IQC followed by another Assembly, repeating as needed.  
   • This covers:
     – Case 4, which exits immediately (no IQC).  
     – Cases 1, 2, 3, 5, which show one or several “IQC  AS” repetitions.  
3. testing_loop = *(TST, RT):  
   • Do a first test.  
   • If it fails, run Re-Testing and return to Testing, repeating until a test passes.  
   • Case 4 exits immediately; Cases 1, 3, 5 iterate one or two times.  
4. PK is always done after the testing loop.  
5. labeling_xor = X(LB, ): either label the package or silently skip labeling ().  
   • Case 2 follows the -branch (LB skipped); all other cases choose LB.  
6. DP  D finalises the process.  

This single POWL model reproduces every path, including:  
• optional IQC iterations,  
• optional RT iterations,  
• optional labeling,  
while keeping the remaining flow strictly ordered and free of unnecessary concurrency.
