The visualization is a composite figure composed of three parts, labeled (a), (b), and (c), illustrating aspects of a process modeling approach involving "proclets," channels, and related concepts.

**Part (a): Two proclet classes connected through two channels**

This section presents a process flow diagram, likely an instance of a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)-like diagram, illustrating two separate processes that interact.

*   **Left Process ("Lab visit"):** Starts with a circle icon (start event) and involves sequential steps like "Order entry," "Take blood sample," and decision points. Activities are associated with roles such as "doctor" and "lab assistant" (indicated by arrows pointing from the role name to the activity). Key intermediate steps include "Receive result," "Judge results" (a decision gateway), and potentially redoing the process ("Do tests again") or concluding ("Send report").
*   **Right Process ("Lab test"):** Also starts with a circle icon (start event) and involves activities like "Perform test" and "Make report." These steps are associated with the "chemical analyst" role. The process includes steps for receiving input, making a decision, and potentially performing the test again ("Perform test again") and providing an updated report ("Provide updated report") before concluding with a final square icon (end event).
*   **Channels (Dashed Rectangles):** The two processes are linked by communication channels represented by dashed rectangular boundaries:
    *   **"Order system":** Connects "Order entry" in the "Lab visit" process to the start of the "Lab test" process. It shows multiplicity notations: $(*, 1)$ on the sending side and $(1, 1)$ on the receiving side.
    *   **"HIS" (Hospital Information System):** This channel facilitates the transfer of results and potentially updated test requests between the two proclets. It involves multiple connections, with various multiplicity constraints like $(1, *)$ and $(1, 7)$ (for maximum instances) connecting "Receive result," "Judge results," "Do tests again," and "Receive updated result" with the corresponding steps in the "Lab test" process (e.g., "Make report," "Perform test again," "Provide updated report").

**Part (b): Class diagram containing the two proclet classes**

This is a simple UML Class Diagram showing the relationship between the two main entities defined in Part (a).

*   It displays two classes: **"Lab visit"** and **"Lab test"**.
*   A relationship labeled **"requires"** connects the two classes.
*   The multiplicity indicates that one "Lab visit" (1..1) can require one or more "Lab test" instances (1..*).

**Part (c): Example of a performative**

This section is a table providing a specific example of an interaction or message (a "performative") that might occur within the system modeled in Part (a).

The table has the following columns and content:

| Time | Channel | Sender | Receivers | Action | Content | Scope | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 11:00 | Order system | Lab visit - John | Lab test - HGB John | Create | Can you perform a HGB test for John? | Private | OUT |

This table details the properties of a message initiating a test request from the "Lab visit" context to the "Lab test" context via the "Order system" channel.
