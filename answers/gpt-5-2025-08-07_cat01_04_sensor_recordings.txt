Here’s a high-level segmentation of the event log into activities, with the rationale for each label. I grouped events where the sensor patterns are stable or evolve consistently and used changes (temperature, vibration, flow, pressure, tool motion, energy) as boundaries between phases.

Activity 1: Idle / Machine Ready (Events 1–3)
- Pattern: Very low temperature (20–21°C), baseline pressure (1 bar), no vibration (0 Hz), no flow (0), tool at home (0 mm), minimal energy (0.40–0.50 kWh).
- Why: This is a classic standby signature prior to a cycle start.

Activity 2: Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)
- Pattern: Temperature rises sharply (5058°C), moderate vibration (3038 Hz), material flow present and steady (5 units/s), pressure slightly elevated (11.5 bar), tool advancing (510 mm), energy increases (2.03.0 kWh).
- Why: Cutting typically shows increased heat and vibration, steady coolant/chip flow, progressive tool motion, and higher energy draw.

Activity 3: Part Positioning and Assembly/Clamping (Events 7–8)
- Pattern: Temperature drops to a mid-level steady state (40°C), pressure increases to 2 bar, low vibration (10 Hz), lower but nonzero flow (2 units/s), tool at a new hold position (15 mm), energy steady (~2.0 kWh).
- Why: Elevated pressure with modest vibration and small flow suggests pneumatic clamping/part placement or fastening. The tool holds position rather than advancing, which fits alignment/assembly or fixture clamping more than cutting.

Activity 4: Welding (Event 9)
- Pattern: Large spike in temperature (80°C), high vibration (50 Hz), no material flow (0), tool position held (15 mm), energy peaks (5.0 kWh).
- Why: Welding produces heat and high energy consumption without material flow; the tool typically holds a fixed position during a weld.

Activity 5: Cooldown / Unclamp / Reset (Event 10)
- Pattern: Temperature drops (30°C), pressure back to baseline (1 bar), very low vibration (1 Hz), no flow, tool still at 15 mm, energy low (1.0 kWh).
- Why: Immediately post-weld cooling/reset with minimal motion and low loads.

Activity 6: Quality Inspection (Events 11–12)
- Pattern: Low temperature (25°C), baseline pressure (1 bar), small steady vibration (5 Hz), small flow (1 unit/s; e.g., air jet or cleaning), tool repositions to 20 mm, moderate energy (1.5–1.6 kWh).
- Why: Gentle tool movement and low, steady signals match probing/inspection or light cleaning; not enough heat/flow/energy for fabrication.

Activity 7: Idle / End of Cycle (Events 13–15)
- Pattern: Return to the initial idle signature (20–21°C, 1 bar, 0 Hz vibration, no flow, tool at home 0 mm, low energy 0.40–0.50 kWh).
- Why: Indicates the process completed and the machine returned to standby.

Notes:
- “Packaging” is not evident on this machine; it likely occurs downstream or on a different resource, as none of the phases show the characteristic handling/flow changes that would differentiate packaging.
