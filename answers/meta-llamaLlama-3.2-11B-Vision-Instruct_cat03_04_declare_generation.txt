This dictionary represents the DECLARE model for the product design and launch process with the specified activities and declarative rules. Each key corresponds to a type of declarative rule, and the values are dictionaries containing the activities and their corresponding support and confidence values. Note that some of the rules have been filled based on a hypothetical scenario. You should adapt it to your actual data and specifications.
