To construct the corresponding POWL model for the described telecom company's digital service provisioning process, we'll break down the process into individual components and use the provided classes from the `pm4py` library to build the model. Here is the Python code to create the POWL model:

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions
service_request = Transition(label="Service Request (SR)")
contract_setup = Transition(label="Contract Setup (CS)")
datacenter_allocation = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation (DA)")
access_control_initialization = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization (ACI)")
base_network_configuration = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration (BNC)")
debug_reconfigure = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)")
containerized_deployment = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment (CD)")
monolithic_deployment = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment (MD)")
quality_assurance = Transition(label="Quality Assurance (QA)")
security_audit = Transition(label="Security Audit (SA)")
go_live_approval = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval (GLA)")
silent_transition = SilentTransition()

# Define loop operator for BNC and D&R
bnc_drc_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[base_network_configuration, debug_reconfigure])

# Define XOR operator for CD and MD
container_monolithic_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[containerized_deployment, monolithic_deployment])

# Define partial order for QA and SA
qa_sa_partial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[quality_assurance, security_audit])

# Define the overall POWL model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    service_request,
    contract_setup,
    StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[datacenter_allocation, access_control_initialization]),
    bnc_drc_loop,
    container_monolithic_xor,
    qa_sa_partial_order,
    go_live_approval
])

# Add edges to represent the order constraints
root.order.add_edge(service_request, contract_setup)
root.order.add_edge(contract_setup, datacenter_allocation)
root.order.add_edge(contract_setup, access_control_initialization)
root.order.add_edge(datacenter_allocation, bnc_drc_loop)
root.order.add_edge(access_control_initialization, bnc_drc_loop)
root.order.add_edge(bnc_drc_loop, container_monolithic_xor)
root.order.add_edge(container_monolithic_xor, qa_sa_partial_order)
root.order.add_edge(qa_sa_partial_order, go_live_approval)

# Ensure QA and SA are part of the same partial order
qa_sa_partial_order.order.add_edge(quality_assurance, security_audit)
qa_sa_partial_order.order.add_edge(security_audit, quality_assurance)

# Print the root POWL model to verify the structure
print(root)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Service Request (SR)** and **Contract Setup (CS)**: These activities form a sequential dependency.
2. **Datacenter Allocation (DA)** and **Access Control Initialization (ACI)**: These activities can be performed concurrently and thus are placed under a `StrictPartialOrder` with no additional order constraints between them.
3. **Base Network Configuration (BNC)** and **Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)**: These activities form a loop, which is represented using the `LOOP` operator.
4. **Containerized Deployment (CD)** and **Monolithic Deployment (MD)**: These activities form an exclusive choice, represented using the `XOR` operator.
5. **Quality Assurance (QA)** and **Security Audit (SA)**: These activities can be performed in any order and are part of the same `StrictPartialOrder`.
6. **Go-Live Approval (GLA)**: This activity can only start once both QA and SA are completed.

This code constructs the POWL model according to the described process, ensuring all constraints and relationships are correctly represented.
