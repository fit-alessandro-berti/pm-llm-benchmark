# **Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels Optimization**

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**
To create a cohesive event log for process mining, we must:
- **Unify event logs** from GPS, scanner, dispatch, and maintenance systems under a shared `Case ID` (Vehicle-Day).
- **Standardize timestamps** and ensure synchronous event ordering.
- **Resolve missing or conflicting data** (e.g., GPS gaps vs. scanner logs).
- **Link events** (e.g., GPS speed data with scanner delivery attempts).
- **Challenges**:
  - **Event misalignment**: GPS and scanner timestamps may not sync perfectly.
  - **Incomplete data**: Some GPS tracks may miss location updates.
  - **Noisy event data**: Engine warnings may appear as false positives.

### **Process Discovery**
- Use **ProM (Process Mining Framework)** or **Celonis** to apply:
  - **Alpha Miner** (for high-level process flow).
  - **Inductive Miner** (for more precise variants).
- **Visualization**:
  - **End-to-end delivery process** (depot  stops  failed/ successful deliveries  unscheduled stops  depot return).
  - **Variants** (e.g., routes with high traffic delays vs. smooth flows).

### **Conformance Checking**
- Compare discovered process models against **planned dispatch routes** (from the dispatch system).
- **Key Deviations to Detect**:
  - **Sequence deviations**: Driver deviates from planned stops (e.g., taking a shortcut or avoiding traffic).
  - **Unplanned stops**: Frequent unscheduled pauses (e.g., maintenance, traffic jams).
  - **Time deviations**: Delays in arriving at customer locations due to traffic or inefficient routing.

## **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
| KPI | Calculation | Importance |
|-----|------------|------------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | (Successful Deliveries within Time Window) / (Total Planned Deliveries) | Measures punctuality |
| **Average Time per Stop** | (Total Time Spent at Customer Locations) / (Number of Stops) | Identifies slow service times |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio** | (Total Travel Time) / (Total Service Time) | Reveals routing vs. on-site inefficiencies |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/package** | (Fuel Used) / (Total Distance) | Helps optimize fuel efficiency |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | (Total Operating Hours) / (Total Available Hours) | Assesses fleet efficiency |
| **Traffic Delay Frequency** | (Number of Low-Speed Events) / (Total Trips) | Highlights traffic hotspots |
| **Failed Delivery Rate** | (Failed Deliveries) / (Total Attempts) | Indicates need for better scheduling |

### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques**
- **Transition Systems Analysis**: Identify slowing activities (e.g., parking, customer interactions).
- **Performance Spectrum**: Compare fastest vs. slowest routes.
- **Conformance Check with Time Windows**: Detect where actual vs. planned times diverge.
- **Geospatial Bottlenecks**: Overlay GPS data with traffic heatmaps to find recurring delays.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes**
1. **Suboptimal Route Planning**
   - Static routes ignore real-time traffic.
   - Process mining can reveal if deviations improve efficiency.
2. **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimates**
   - Dispatch system may underestimate peak-hour delays.
   - Compare planned vs. actual travel times.
3. **Traffic Congestion Hotspots**
   - GPS speed data shows where drivers slow down.
4. **High Service Time Variability**
   - Some customers take longer for handoff (e.g., signature requirements).
5. **Vehicle Maintenance Issues**
   - Frequent unscheduled stops correlation with maintenance logs.
6. **Driver Behavior**
   - Some drivers idle longer, others follow optimal routes.
7. **Failed Deliveries**
   - Repeated attempts increase costs; better scheduling or customer notifications help.

### **Process Mining Validation**
- **Variant Analysis**: Compare high vs. low-performing drivers/vehicles.
- **Dwell Time Analysis**: Identify why some stops take longer.
- **Traffic Correlation**: Overlay speed data with delivery delays.

## **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

### **1. Dynamic Routing Adjustments**
- **Bottleneck**: Static routes ignore real-time traffic.
- **Root Cause**: Dispatch system lacks flexibility.
- **Strategy**:
  - Use process mining to identify high-delay routes.
  - Integrate real-time traffic data to adjust routes on-the-fly.
- **Expected Impact**:
  - Reduced travel time, improved on-time delivery.

### **2. Optimized Delivery Territories**
- **Bottleneck**: Overloaded or inefficiently grouped stops.
- **Root Cause**: Uneven workload distribution.
- **Strategy**:
  - Cluster stops by historical delays, traffic patterns, and driver performance.
  - Assign optimal routes per vehicle.
- **Expected Impact**:
  - Balanced workload, lower fuel consumption.

### **3. Predictive Maintenance**
- **Bottleneck**: Unscheduled maintenance stops.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of proactive vehicle monitoring.
- **Strategy**:
  - Use event logs to detect patterns (e.g., engine warnings before breakdowns).
  - Schedule maintenance during off-peak hours.
- **Expected Impact**:
  - Reduced downtime, lower repair costs.

### **4. Reduced Failed Deliveries**
- **Bottleneck**: High re-delivery attempts.
- **Root Cause**: Poor time window alignment.
- **Strategy**:
  - Analyze failed delivery times; optimize delivery windows.
  - Use predictive analytics to forecast customer availability.
- **Expected Impact**:
  - Lower failed delivery rate, fewer trips.

## **5. Operational Constraints & Continuous Monitoring**

### **Constraints Consideration**
- **Driver Hours**: Ensure optimizations don’t violate labor laws.
- **Vehicle Capacity**: Match stops to van load limits.
- **Customer Time Windows**: Adjust routing without violating SLAs.

### **Continuous Monitoring Plan**
- **Process Mining Dashboard**:
  - Track **On-Time Delivery Rate** trends.
  - Monitor **traffic hotspots** with geospatial visualization.
  - Alert on **unexpected deviations** from optimal paths.
- **Feedback Loop**:
  - Regularly update routing models with new data.
  - Retrain drivers based on inefficiency patterns.
