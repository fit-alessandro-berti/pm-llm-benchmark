Below is a walkthrough of the model linebyline, followed by a summary of the two variants (Standard vs. Custom) and of the possible approval / rework situations.


1. Start Event  
   • The trigger is the arrival of a customer enquiry or purchase order.

2. Task A  – “Receive Customer Request”  
   • Sales (or Customer Service) records the request, checks it for completeness and creates the case in the ERP / CRM system.  
   • Output: a request record containing basic data such as customer, product, quantity, desired date, special notes, etc.

3. XOR Gateway – “Check Request Type”  
   • An Exclusive gateway means only ONE outgoing branch is taken.  
   • The branch is selected by inspecting the request:  
     – “Standard”  The catalogue item exists exactly as requested.  
     – “Custom”   The customer wants either a configuration that is not in the catalogue or an entirely bespoke product/service.


Standard Path

4. Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”  
   • Simple administrative and technical checks: correct catalogue number, sales region, payment terms present, etc.

5. AND Gateway (Parallel Split) – “Run Parallel Checks”  
   • An AND split launches two checks at the same time because they are independent.  

6a. Task C1 – “Credit Check”  
   • Finance verifies the customer’s credit limit, open items, blocked accounts, etc.  

6b. Task C2 – “Inventory Check”  
   • Logistics or the warehouse module verifies whether the requested quantity is in stock or can be produced in time.  

7. AND Join – “All Parallel Checks Completed”  
   • The flow waits here until BOTH 6a and 6b are finished.  

8. Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”  
   • Using lead times, plant capacity and transport constraints, the system or planner calculates a realistic promised date.  
   • Output: Draft order confirmation data (price is fixed by catalogue, only date was missing).


Custom Path

4. Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
   • Engineering and/or Product Management examine whether the requested modification is technically doable, falls within company strategy, and is profitable.

5. XOR Gateway – “Is Customisation Feasible?”  
   • Exclusive decision:  
     – Yes  continue the sales cycle.  
     – No   immediate rejection.  

6a. If Yes  Task E1 – “Prepare Custom Quotation”  
   • Engineering produces a technical concept; Sales calculates price, leadtime, oneoff tooling costs, etc.  
   • Output: Draft quotation for the customer and for internal approval.

6b. If No  Task E2 – “Send Rejection Notice”  End Event  
   • Customer is politely informed; the case is closed.


Common Section (both variants reconverge here)

9. XOR Gateway – “Is Approval Needed?”  
   • Typical criteria:  
     – Order value or margin outside predefined limits.  
     – Unusual payment terms or large discount.  
     – First order from a new customer.  
   • If the request satisfies governance rules, no approval is required; otherwise management must sign off.

10a. If Approval Needed  Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval”  
     • Proposal (quotation for custom, draft order for standard) plus credit / risk material is routed to the responsible manager.

11a. XOR Gateway – “Is Approval Granted?”  
     • Yes  Task G – “Generate Final Invoice”  
       – The ERP system turns the quotation or order into a billable document; accounting numbers are assigned.  
     • No   Task H – “Reevaluate Conditions”  
       – Sales must modify price, delivery date, or technical content.  
       – LOOP:  
         • If the case originated from the Custom path, the flow returns to Task E1 (update the quotation).  
         • If the case is Standard, it returns to Task D (rework delivery promise or other conditions).  
       – After rework the case is resubmitted for approval.

10b. If No Approval Needed  Task G directly.

12. Task G – “Generate Final Invoice”  
    • Creation of the billing document and/or final order confirmation, including all legally relevant data.

13. Task I – “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
    • The customer receives either an order confirmation (standard) or an accepted quotation (custom), plus the invoice if billing at order time is required.

14. End Event  
    • The “sales acceptance” phase is finished; subsequent execution (production, shipment, etc.) is outside the scope of this model.


Key Concepts & Gateway Semantics

• XOR (Exclusive) Gateway  
  – Only one outgoing path is chosen; all others are ignored.  
• AND (Parallel) Gateway  
  – All outgoing paths are launched in parallel; the corresponding join waits for every branch.  
• Loopback arrow from Task H to Task E1 or D  
  – Represents iterative negotiation until management is satisfied.  
• Merge after Task D and Task E1  
  – A simple sequence flow (implicit merge) because only one of those tasks can be active at a time.


Standard vs. Custom – What Really Changes?

1. Type of preliminary analysis  
   – Standard: quick, cataloguebased validation.  
   – Custom: deep technical and commercial feasibility study.

2. Parallel checks  
   – Only Standard path invokes Credit and Inventory in parallel.  
     (For Custom, credit is usually part of the managerial approval later.)

3. Earliest possible stop  
   – Custom path can terminate early if feasibility = NO.  
   – Standard path only stops if later approval is denied and Sales finally abandons the request (not shown explicitly).

4. Deliverables  
   – Standard: Confirmed order with promised delivery date.  
   – Custom: Formal quotation that the customer still has to sign; once accepted it becomes an order.


Triggers for Approval & Rework

• Approval is triggered by internal policy (value, margin, new customer, special risk, etc.).  
• Rework (Task H) is triggered only when the designated approver rejects the proposal.  
  – Typical reasons: too much discount, unrealistic leadtime, inadequate margin, technical risk.  
  – The loop continues until either approval is granted or the sales team gives up and the case is closed.

This explanation should enable you to understand not only what happens in each BPMN element, but also why those elements are there from a businesscontrol perspective.
