Detailed walkthrough of the model  

1. Start event  
   • A customer places a request (phone, web, e-mail, etc.). The start event only marks the moment the process becomes active; no work is done yet.

2. Task A – “Receive Customer Request”  
   • The request is registered and the basic data (customer ID, items, quantities, special wishes) are captured.  
   • Output: a complete request record that can now be classified.

3. XOR gateway – “Check Request Type”  
   • Exclusive (XOR) means one – and only one – path is taken.  
   • The decision is based on a business rule: Does the request match the list of catalog products and standard delivery terms?  
     – Standard  follow the “Standard” branch.  
     – Custom   follow the “Custom” branch.

  
A. Standard branch
  
4. Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”  
   • Checks that the order header is complete, prices are valid, customer is in good standing, etc.

5. AND gateway (split) – “Run Parallel Checks”  
   • Parallel (AND) means all outgoing branches run simultaneously.  
   • Two risk/compliance checks start at the same time:

     5a. Task C1 – “Credit Check”  
         – Queries credit-rating service or internal limits.

     5b. Task C2 – “Inventory Check”  
         – Confirms stock on hand or allocates stock.

6. AND gateway (join) – “All Parallel Checks Completed”  
   • The join waits until C1 and C2 are both finished before the flow can continue.

7. Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”  
   • Uses ATP (available-to-promise) logic, warehouse calendars, transport lead-times, etc.  
   • Output: a firm delivery promise.

  
B. Custom branch
  
4*. Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
   • Engineering or product management estimate whether the requested modifications are technically and economically doable.

5*. XOR gateway – “Is Customization Feasible?”  
   • Yes  Task E1.  
   • No   Task E2 then End.

     5a*. Task E1 – “Prepare Custom Quotation”  
          – Calculates added engineering hours, special material, longer lead-time; produces a quotation draft.

     5b*. Task E2 – “Send Rejection Notice”  
          – Politely declines; the process ends here for this request.

  
Common continuation for both viable paths
  
8. XOR gateway – “Is Approval Needed?”  
   • A rule evaluates amount, margin, customer segment, etc.  
     – If any threshold is exceeded  approval required.  
     – Otherwise continue to invoicing.

9. Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval” (only if needed)  
   • Manager (sales, finance, or engineering) reviews the draft order/quotation.

10. XOR gateway – “Is Approval Granted?”  
    • Yes  Task G.  
    • No   Task H.

11. Task H – “Re-evaluate Conditions”  
    • Sales or engineering adjusts price, scope, lead-time to satisfy the approver’s objections.  
    • Loop logic  
      – If the request is Custom, the corrected information is sent back to Task E1 (prepare a revised quotation).  
      – If the request is Standard, the loop returns to Task D (recalculate delivery date with new parameters).  
    • After the corrections the flow again reaches the “Is Approval Needed?” or “Is Approval Granted?” evaluation, repeating until approval is given or the order is withdrawn.

12. Task G – “Generate Final Invoice”  
    • Creates the official sales order in the ERP system, final pricing, tax, delivery terms.

13. Task I – “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
    • E-mail or portal message with order number, agreed price, and expected delivery.

14. End event  
    • Process is finished; operational fulfilment (picking, production, shipping) can start outside this scope.

Key gateway semantics  

• XOR (Exclusive) gateway: only one outgoing path is chosen; it is used for either/or decisions such as type classification, feasibility, approval results.  
• AND (Parallel) gateway: all outgoing paths are activated in parallel; a downstream AND join waits for every branch to complete before moving on.

How the paths converge  

• Standard path converges after Task D.  
• Custom path (if feasible) converges after Task E1.  
  Both enter the same “Is Approval Needed?” XOR gateway, unifying the flow.  
• Parallel credit/inventory checks converge via the AND join before delivery date calculation.  
• Loops caused by a “No” in approval send the flow back to the appropriate preparation task (E1 or D), forming a cycle that continues until a “Yes” is achieved or the request is abandoned.

Triggers for approval or rework  

• Approval is triggered when predefined business rules (order value, margin, risk category, customer rating, etc.) flag the request.  
• Rework is triggered when the approver explicitly rejects or requests changes. The loop ensures the same material does not bypass the approval requirement; it must cycle until approval is granted.

Difference between Standard and Custom handling  

Standard requests  
   – Follow a streamlined path with automated validation and objective checks (credit, inventory).  
   – Delivery promise is calculated immediately.  
   – No feasibility analysis is needed; rejection is rare and usually based on stock or credit issues.

Custom requests  
   – Require specialist feasibility analysis (technical and commercial).  
   – Can be rejected early if not feasible.  
   – Produce a custom quotation instead of a direct delivery promise.  
   – Rework loops return to quotation preparation (E1) because pricing or design may change during approvals.

Summary  

The pseudo-BPMN describes a customer-order intake process that intelligently branches for standard versus custom requests, runs compliance checks in parallel for efficiency, introduces conditional managerial approval, and supports iterative re-work until either approval is secured or the request is rejected—all before committing to fulfilment.
