**Organizing patient cases and events**
</think>
I’ve grouped the events into three patient “cases,” using the most consistent attributes (patient age, gender, department, and the logical flow of activities). Here’s how the events cluster:

| Case ID | Events (by list numbers) | Narrative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Case A (ER, M, 45 yrs)** | 1  4  7  12  15 | The 45-year-old male arrives at the ER, is triaged by Nurse Joy, sent for an X-ray, receives a consultation with Dr. Lee confirming a hairline fracture, and is discharged with outpatient follow-up. |
| **Case B (ER, F, 62 yrs)** | 2  5  8  10  11  14  17 | The 62-year-old female is registered and triaged, Dr. Smith orders labs which come back normal, diagnoses a minor infection, prescribes antibiotics, and she’s discharged with instructions to pick up meds. |
| **Case C (Surgery, M, 28 yrs)** | 3  6  9  13  16  18 | The 28-year-old male presents for scheduled surgery, consults with Dr. Lee, goes through prep, has arthroscopy performed, recovers stably, and is discharged with physiotherapy follow-up. |

This grouping keeps the patient journeys coherent, preserving ordering across interleaved events.
