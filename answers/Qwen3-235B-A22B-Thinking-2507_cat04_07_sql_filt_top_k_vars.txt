Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the task is to write a DuckDB SQL query that handles an event log. The main goal is to find the top K process variants based on the number of cases following each variant and then return all events from those top K variants.

First, I need to understand what a process variant is. It's the ordered sequence of activities per case, sorted by timestamp. So for each case_id, we need to get the activities in the order they happened.

Step 1: Determine the sequence of activities per case. To do this, for each case_id, we should sort the activities by timestamp and then concatenate them into a sequence. In SQL, this can be done using STRING_AGG or LIST_AGG, but since we need the order, we have to make sure the aggregation is ordered by timestamp.

Wait, in DuckDB, the STRING_AGG function has an ORDER BY clause. So for each case_id, we can group by case_id and then STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) to get the sequence. But maybe the separator isn't specified, but the problem says "ordered sequence", so the order matters, but the actual separator might not be important as long as the sequence is correctly ordered.

Step 2: Group cases by their variant (the sequence) and count how many cases have each variant. So after generating the variant sequence for each case, we can group by that sequence and count the number of case_ids.

Step 3: Find the top K variants by count. So we need to rank the variants based on their count, take the top K.

Step 4: Then, get all events from the original log where the case_id is part of those top K variants.

Let me break it down into parts.

First, create a CTE that gets the variant for each case. So:

WITH case_variants AS (
SELECT
case_id,
STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id
)

Wait, but STRING_AGG might not be the best if there are many activities, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints. Alternatively, maybe using LIST and then converting to a string, but STRING_AGG should work.

But wait, the problem says "sequence of activities", so the order is crucial. Using ORDER BY timestamp in the STRING_AGG ensures that.

Then, another CTE to count the variants:

variant_counts AS (
SELECT
variant,
COUNT(*) AS variant_count
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY variant_count DESC
LIMIT K
)

Wait, but K is a parameter. The problem says "top K variants", so K should be a variable. But in SQL, we can't have a variable unless it's a parameter. However, the problem says "in your query, ensure that you...", so probably K is a placeholder, and the user is supposed to write the query with K as a parameter, maybe using a LIMIT K.

But the problem statement says "top K variants by their frequency", so the query should have a LIMIT K in the part where we select the top variants.

Then, we need to get the case_ids that are in the top K variants. So first, get the top K variants (their variant strings), then find all case_ids whose variant is in that list.

Wait, but the variant is defined per case_id, so case_variants has case_id and variant. Then variant_counts groups by variant. So to get the top K variants, we select variant from variant_counts (after ordering and limiting). Then, join back to case_variants to get the case_ids that have those variants.

So the steps would be:

1. For each case_id, compute the variant (ordered activity sequence).
2. Count how many cases per variant.
3. Select the top K variants (variant strings) based on count.
4. Find all case_ids that have variants in the top K.
5. Select all rows from event_log where case_id is in those case_ids.

Putting it all together.

Let me outline the query:

WITH case_variants AS (
SELECT
case_id,
STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id
),
top_variants AS (
SELECT variant
FROM (
SELECT
variant,
COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT K
)
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_variants cv ON el.case_id = cv.case_id
JOIN top_variants tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant;

Wait, but the problem says "return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants".

Yes, so after identifying the top K variants (the variant strings), we need to get all case_ids that have those variants, then get all events for those case_ids.

In the above query, case_variants gives each case_id and its variant. top_variants is the list of top K variant strings. Then, joining event_log to case_variants on case_id, and then filtering where variant is in top_variants.

But in the CTE top_variants, we have the variant strings. So the join between case_variants and top_variants on variant will give the case_ids that are in top variants.

Alternatively, maybe using a WHERE clause with IN.

But using a JOIN is probably more efficient.

Wait, in the top_variants CTE, we have the variant strings of the top K. Then, in the main query, we can do:

SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.case_id IN (
SELECT cv.case_id
FROM case_variants cv
WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
);

But the way I wrote earlier with joins is equivalent.

But let's check the structure.

Another thing: the problem says "top K variants by their frequency". So the count per variant is the number of cases, so in the variant_counts, we do COUNT(*) from case_variants grouped by variant.

Yes.

Now, the problem is that in the top_variants CTE, we need to get the top K variants. So the subquery in top_variants should order by count descending and limit to K.

But in SQL, when using LIMIT, it's better to have an ORDER BY. So in the variant_counts part, we need to order by count(*) DESC.

Wait, in the case_variants CTE, each row is a case_id and its variant. So when we group by variant in the next step, COUNT(*) is the number of case_ids per variant.

Yes.

So the correct approach is:

1. Compute variant per case (case_variants).
2. Group by variant, count, order by count desc, take top K variants (top_variants).
3. Select all events where case_id is in the set of case_ids that have variants in top_variants.

So the query would be:

WITH case_variants AS (
SELECT
case_id,
STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id
),
top_variant_list AS (
SELECT variant
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT K
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_variants cv ON el.case_id = cv.case_id
WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variant_list);

Wait, but in the top_variant_list CTE, we can directly select the variants with GROUP BY and ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT K.

Yes, that's more efficient than having a subquery.

So top_variant_list is selecting the variant from case_variants, grouped by variant, ordered by count desc, limited to K.

Then, in the main query, we join event_log with case_variants on case_id, and filter where variant is in top_variant_list.

This should give all events from cases that are in top K variants.

But let's check if there's a possible issue. For example, if two different case_ids have the same variant, then they are grouped together. So the count per variant is correct.

Another thing: the STRING_AGG separator. The problem doesn't specify how the sequence is represented, but as long as the order is correct, the separator can be anything. Using '->' is common, but maybe the problem doesn't care about the separator, just the order. However, in DuckDB, STRING_AGG requires a separator. So we can use any, like empty string or '->'. But if two activities are 'A' and 'B', with separator '', it becomes 'AB', which is different from 'A->B'. But since all sequences use the same separator, the grouping will be correct.

So using '->' as separator is safe.

Another point: timestamps might have duplicates? The problem says "sorting events within that case by their timestamp". If two events in the same case have the same timestamp, the order might be undefined. But the problem doesn't specify how to handle that. We'll assume that timestamps are unique per case, or that the order in case of ties doesn't matter for the variant definition. So the query uses ORDER BY timestamp in the STRING_AGG, which will order them, and if there are ties, the order might be arbitrary, but that's acceptable per the problem statement.

Now, the problem says "top K variants by their frequency". So K is a parameter. In the query, we need to have LIMIT K. But in SQL, K would be a number, like LIMIT 10. But the problem says "in your query, ensure that you...", so the query should have a placeholder for K, perhaps as a comment, but since SQL doesn't support variables like K, the user is supposed to write the query with K as a literal, but the problem probably expects the query to have a LIMIT K where K is to be replaced by the user.

Wait, the problem says "determine the top K variants", so in the actual query, K would be a number, but since the problem is general, the query should have a LIMIT K clause, where K is a parameter. However, in standard SQL, you can't have a parameter like that unless using prepared statements, but in the context of this problem, the answer should present the query with K as a placeholder, perhaps with a comment.

But the problem says "Construct a DuckDB SQL query...", so the answer should have the query with K as a number, but since K is variable, probably the query uses LIMIT K, and the user is expected to replace K with the desired number.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "determine the top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)." So K is a parameter given by the user. Therefore, in the query, it should have a LIMIT clause with K, like LIMIT 10 for K=10.

But since the problem says "your query", the answer should include the query with K as a placeholder. However, in SQL, you can't have a variable K unless it's a bind parameter, but in the context of this problem, the expected answer is to write the query with a LIMIT K, where K is to be specified by the user.

Wait, the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants." So the query must have a way to specify K. In SQL, this would be a LIMIT clause with a number. But since K is a parameter, the correct approach is to have the query use LIMIT K, but in actual SQL, K must be a literal. However, for the purpose of this problem, the answer should present the query with K as a placeholder, perhaps indicating that K should be replaced with the desired number.

But looking at examples of such problems, usually, the query is written with a LIMIT clause where K is a number, but since the problem says "top K", the answer should have LIMIT K, and the user is to understand that K is a parameter.

Wait, but in DuckDB, you can use a parameter in LIMIT if you're using prepared statements, but in a static query, it's a literal. However, the problem doesn't specify whether K is a specific number or a variable. Since the problem says "top K", the answer should have a LIMIT clause with K, but in the actual SQL syntax, it's a number. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "determine the top K variants", so the query should have a way to specify K. In the answer, we can write the query with a comment indicating where K is, like LIMIT 10, but the problem probably expects the query to have a placeholder like LIMIT K, but SQL doesn't allow that. So perhaps the correct way is to write the query with a LIMIT clause, and in the explanation, note that K should be replaced with the desired number.

But according to the problem statement, the user is to construct the query, so the answer should have the query with K as part of the LIMIT. For example, LIMIT 5 for K=5, but since K is general, the answer uses LIMIT K, but in reality, in SQL, it's a number. However, given that this is a template, the expected answer would have LIMIT K, even though in practice you'd put a number.

Wait, looking at similar problems, often they use a variable like :K or something, but in standard SQL, it's not possible. Given that, perhaps the answer should have a comment indicating that K is to be replaced, but the query itself uses a LIMIT with a number. But the problem says "top K variants", so the correct approach in the query is to have a LIMIT K, but since SQL requires a literal, the answer should present it as LIMIT K, understanding that in practice, the user substitutes K with a number.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the query to have a parameter, but since it's not possible, the answer uses a placeholder.

In any case, the structure of the query is as outlined.

Another possible issue: the use of STRING_AGG. In some databases, the function might be called GROUP_CONCAT or something else, but DuckDB uses STRING_AGG. According to DuckDB documentation, STRING_AGG is available and supports ORDER BY.

Yes, DuckDB's STRING_AGG has the syntax:

STRING_AGG(expression, separator) [ ORDER BY ... ]

So the correct syntax is STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp).

Another thing: the problem says "the ordered sequence of activities", so the separator might not matter as long as the order is preserved. Using '->' is fine.

Now, let's check if the query correctly returns all events from the top K variant cases.

The case_variants CTE gets each case_id and its variant.

The top_variant_list gets the top K variants (the variant strings).

Then, the main query selects all events from event_log where the case_id's variant is in top_variant_list.

Yes, because we join event_log with case_variants on case_id, then filter where variant is in top_variant_list.

Alternatively, using a WHERE clause with a subquery:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
SELECT case_id
FROM case_variants
WHERE variant IN (
SELECT variant
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT K
)
);

This is another way to write it, perhaps more concise.

But the CTE approach is clearer.

Let me write the full query:

WITH case_variants AS (
SELECT
case_id,
STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id
),
top_variants AS (
SELECT variant
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT K
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.case_id IN (
SELECT case_id
FROM case_variants
WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
);

Yes, this should work.

Alternatively, using JOINs:

WITH case_variants AS (
SELECT
case_id,
STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id
),
top_variants AS (
SELECT variant
FROM case_variants
GROUP BY variant
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT K
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_variants cv ON el.case_id = cv.case_id
JOIN top_variants tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant;

This is also correct and might be more efficient.

Both approaches are valid.

Now, testing edge cases.

What if K is larger than the number of variants? Then LIMIT K will just return all variants.

What if multiple variants have the same count? The ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC will order them, but if counts are equal, the order is arbitrary unless another ORDER BY is specified. But the problem says "top K variants by their frequency", so if there's a tie for the K-th position, it's unclear whether to include all or arbitrarily pick. The problem doesn't specify, so the query as written will pick the first K in the order, which may be arbitrary for ties. But that's acceptable per the problem statement.

Another edge case: a case with only one activity. The STRING_AGG would just be that activity.

Now, verifying the steps:

1. For each case_id, ordered activity sequence: done via STRING_AGG with ORDER BY timestamp.

2. Group by variant and count: done in top_variants CTE by grouping case_variants by variant and counting.

3. Top K: LIMIT K in top_variants.

4. Filter events: only those case_ids whose variant is in top K.

Yes, this meets all requirements.

Possible mistake: not ordering the activities correctly. But using ORDER BY timestamp in STRING_AGG ensures the sequence is correct.

Another possible issue: case_id is not unique in case_variants, but since it's grouped by case_id, each case_id appears once.

Yes, case_variants has one row per case_id.

Therefore, the query should work.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to identify the top K process variants based on the frequency of cases following each variant and then retrieve all events from the original event log that belong to these top K variants. A process variant is defined as the ordered sequence of activities in a case, sorted by timestamp.

### Approach
1. **Determine Activity Sequences per Case**: For each `case_id`, aggregate the `activity` values in the order of their `timestamp` to form the process variant sequence.
2. **Count Variants**: Group the cases by their variant sequences and count how many cases correspond to each variant.
3. **Identify Top K Variants**: Sort the variants by their counts in descending order and select the top K variants.
4. **Filter Events**: Retrieve all events from the original log where the `case_id` belongs to one of the top K variants.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
top_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
  LIMIT K
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_variants cv ON el.case_id = cv.case_id
JOIN top_variants tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant;
```

### Explanation
1. **case_variants CTE**: 
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) processes each `case_id` to generate the ordered sequence of activities. Using `STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp)`, it concatenates activities in the order they occurred (sorted by `timestamp`), separated by `->`.

2. **top_variants CTE**:
   - This CTE groups the variants from `case_variants` by their sequence (`variant`), counts the occurrences of each variant, sorts them in descending order of count, and limits the result to the top K variants.

3. **Final Query**:
   - The main query joins the original `event_log` with `case_variants` to link each event to its case's variant sequence. It then filters these events to include only those where the variant sequence is in the `top_variants` list, ensuring only events from the top K variants are returned.

This approach efficiently processes the event log to identify and retrieve events from the most frequent process variants, adhering to the problem's requirements. The use of CTEs ensures clarity and modularity, while the `LIMIT K` clause dynamically adjusts to the desired number of top variants.
