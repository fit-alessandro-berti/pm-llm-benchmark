## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

### **Process Mining Approach for Job Flow Reconstruction**
To analyze the current scheduling performance, we will apply **process mining techniques** on the MES event logs to reconstruct the actual job flows and task execution sequences. Key steps include:

- **Process Discovery:** Use **Alpha Miner, Heuristics Miner, or Inductive Miner** to generate a process model (e.g., a Petri net or BPMN diagram) that visualizes the actual job routings, task sequences, and resource dependencies.
- **Performance Analysis:** Apply **performance mining** to extract key metrics from the event logs, including:
  - **Job Flow Times & Lead Times:** Measure the time from job release to completion, comparing planned vs. actual durations.
  - **Makespan Distributions:** Analyze the total time required to complete all jobs in a given period.
  - **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):** Track the time jobs spend waiting in queues before processing at each machine.
  - **Resource Utilization:** Calculate machine and operator utilization by analyzing productive time, idle time, and setup time.
  - **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** Extract setup durations from logs and correlate them with job sequences to identify patterns (e.g., similar jobs requiring shorter setups).
  - **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness:** Compare actual completion times against due dates to measure tardiness frequency and magnitude.
  - **Disruption Impact Analysis:** Identify breakdowns and priority changes, then measure their effect on job delays and resource utilization.

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

### **Key Inefficiencies Identified via Process Mining**
1. **Bottleneck Identification:**
   - Use **bottleneck analysis** to identify machines with the highest queue lengths and longest waiting times.
   - Example: If `MILL-03` consistently has long queues, it may be a bottleneck.

2. **Poor Task Prioritization:**
   - Compare **on-time vs. late jobs** using variant analysis to see if high-priority jobs are delayed due to suboptimal sequencing.
   - Example: If urgent jobs (`Priority=High`) frequently wait behind lower-priority jobs, the dispatching rules are ineffective.

3. **Suboptimal Sequencing & Setup Times:**
   - Analyze **setup time patterns** to see if jobs are sequenced in a way that unnecessarily increases setup overhead.
   - Example: If `JOB-7001` follows `JOB-6998` with a long setup, but a similar job could have been scheduled instead.

4. **Starvation of Downstream Resources:**
   - Use **resource contention analysis** to detect if upstream bottlenecks cause downstream machines to idle.
   - Example: If `CUT-01` is overloaded, `MILL-03` may starve for work.

5. **Bullwhip Effect in WIP:**
   - Track **WIP fluctuations** over time to see if scheduling variability leads to excessive inventory buildup.

### **Evidence from Process Mining**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare job paths of on-time vs. late jobs to identify inefficiencies.
- **Resource Contention Heatmaps:** Visualize periods of high contention to optimize scheduling.
- **Setup Time Transition Graphs:** Identify optimal job sequences to minimize setup overhead.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

### **Underlying Causes of Scheduling Issues**
1. **Static Dispatching Rules:**
   - Current rules (e.g., FCFS, EDD) do not adapt to real-time shop floor conditions.
2. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
   - No dynamic tracking of machine availability, queue lengths, or job progress.
3. **Inaccurate Task Duration Estimations:**
   - Planned durations may not account for variability in operator performance or job complexity.
4. **Poor Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:**
   - Jobs are not batched or sequenced to minimize setup times.
5. **Ineffective Disruption Response:**
   - No predictive or adaptive mechanisms for breakdowns or urgent jobs.

### **Process Mining for Differentiating Causes**
- **Conformance Checking:** Compare actual execution against planned schedules to see if delays are due to poor scheduling or inherent variability.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Use event logs to trace delays back to specific disruptions (e.g., breakdowns, priority changes).
