### 1) Normative (“expected”) Hire-to-Retire control-flow (simplified)
A typical, logically consistent ordering is:

**Post job  Screen candidates  Interview(s)  Make hiring decision  Onboard employee  Add to payroll  Close case**

Variations exist (e.g., multiple interview rounds, re-screening), but two invariants usually hold:
- **Decision should not precede required evaluation steps** (screening/interviews).
- **Close should be last**, i.e., no substantive HR activities should still be able to occur after closing.
- **Payroll setup is normally mandatory** once someone is hired/onboarded.

## 2) Anomalies per model

## POWL Model 1 — anomalies
**Model 1 constraints:**  
Post  Screen; Screen  Decide; Screen  Interview; Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close.  
No relation is defined between **Interview** and **Decide/Onboard/Payroll/Close**.

### Key anomalies
1. **Hiring decision can occur before interviews (or without interviews).**  
   Because `Interview` is not required before `Decide`, the model allows:
   - Screen  Decide  Onboard …  Close, while interviews happen later or never (depending on interpretation/execution).
   This is a **major logic anomaly**: decision-making is not grounded in interviewing.

2. **Interviews can happen after onboarding, payroll, even after case closure.**  
   Since `Interview` is only constrained to occur after `Screen` and is otherwise unconstrained, it may legally execute **after `Close_Case`**.  
   That is **severe from a process-integrity perspective** (closing a case while core selection activities can still occur).

### What Model 1 still gets right
- **Screening precedes both interviewing and decision**, which is plausible.
- The “back half” is coherent: **Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close** is in the expected order.
- Payroll is not optional.

---

## POWL Model 2 — anomalies
**Model 2 constraints:**  
Post  Screen and Post  Interview (parallel); Interview  Decide  loop(Onboard)  xor(Payroll, skip)  Close.  
Crucially, **Screen is not connected to Decide** (or anything after it).

### Key anomalies
1. **Screening is decoupled from the hiring outcome (can be skipped in practice).**  
   Even though `Screen` exists, it is not a prerequisite for `Decide`, `Onboard`, `Payroll`, or `Close`. So the model allows:
   - Post  Interview  Decide  Onboard …  Close, with Screen happening later or never.
   This is a **fundamental anomaly** because screening is typically a core gating step (or at least must influence the decision path).

2. **Interviews can occur before screening.**  
   Since both only depend on `Post`, interviewing can start immediately after posting, which is **non-normative** (usually you screen before investing in interviews).

3. **Onboarding can repeat arbitrarily (loop with silent “redo”).**  
   `LOOP(Onboard, skip)` implies one or more onboarding executions. Re-onboarding the same employee multiple times is **highly unusual** and generally indicates modeling error (unless it’s meant to represent “rework,” but then a meaningful redo activity would normally be modeled, not a silent skip).

4. **Payroll is optional (XOR(Payroll, skip)).**  
   Allowing the case to close without adding the employee to payroll is **very severe** in a hire-to-retire context: it breaks the essence of completing hiring administration.

5. **Screening can happen after case closure.**  
   Like Model 1’s interview issue, `Screen` is unconstrained w.r.t. `Close` and can occur after closure—again a **process-integrity problem**, and worse here because screening is also not gating anything.

## 3) Which model is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire process?
**Model 1 is closer to the normative process than Model 2.**

### Justification (impact on correctness/integrity)
- **Model 1** preserves a coherent “administrative completion” chain (**Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close**) and keeps **Screen** as a true prerequisite for decision/onboarding. Its main flaw is the missing dependency **Interview  Decide** (and consequently **Interview  Close**), which permits late/after-close interviews.
- **Model 2** violates the process much more deeply:
  - Screening is effectively irrelevant to the hiring outcome,
  - Payroll can be skipped entirely,
  - Onboarding may repeat arbitrarily,
  - And ordering between screening and interviewing is weakened.

**Severity comparison:**  
Model 1’s anomaly is mainly a **missing precedence constraint** (important, but fixable by adding `Interview  Decide` and/or `Interview  Close`).  
Model 2 contains **structural deviations** (optional payroll, looping onboarding, non-gating screening) that undermine the meaning of “hire completed correctly,” making it substantially less normative.
