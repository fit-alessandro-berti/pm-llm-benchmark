### **Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process**

We are given a normative process description and an event log with 5 cases. The goal is to identify which cases **deviate** from the intended process flow and **explain** the nature of the violations.

---

### **Summary of Normative Process Rules**

From the textual description, we can extract the following **key rules**:

1. **Order of Activities**:
   - The process **must begin** with "Receive order".
   - "Check inventory" **must occur immediately after** "Receive order" and **before any other decision-making** (e.g., payment or fulfillment).
   - Based on inventory check:
     - **If sufficient inventory**:
       -  Authorize payment
       -  Package items
       -  Ship order
       -  Close order
     - **If insufficient inventory**:
       -  Cancel order
       -  Close order
   - "Close order" **must be the final activity in every case**.

2. **Conditional Constraints**:
   - **"Authorize payment"**:
     - Must occur **after** "Check inventory".
     - Must occur **before** "Package items".
     - Should **only happen if inventory is sufficient** (implied, since payment shouldn't be authorized for unfulfillable orders).
   - **"Package items"**:
     - Must occur **after** "Authorize payment".
     - Must occur **before** "Ship order".
   - **"Ship order"**:
     - Must occur **after** "Package items".
     - Must **not occur after "Cancel order"**.
   - **"Cancel order"**:
     - Should follow "Check inventory" **only when inventory is insufficient**.
     - Once "Cancel order" occurs, **no fulfillment activities** (e.g., package, ship, authorize) should follow—though "Close order" must still follow.
   - **"Close order"**:
     - Must be the **last activity** in **all** cases.

---

Now, let's analyze each case.

---

### **Case 1**

| Activity Sequence | Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close |

- **Analysis**:
  - Starts correctly.
  - "Check inventory" occurs before any other action.
  - Inventory is sufficient  proceeds with payment, packaging, shipping.
  - All activities in correct order.
  - Ends with "Close order".

 **No violation**.

---

### **Case 2**

| Activity Sequence | Receive  Check  **Package  Authorize**  Ship  Close |

- **Violation**:
  - "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment".
  - According to the normative process:  
    > *"Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known.*  
    > *"Package items" should only occur after authorization...*

  - **Packaging before authorization** violates the control flow.
  - Even if inventory is sufficient, **payment must be authorized before preparing items for shipment** (to avoid preparing items for a customer whose payment may fail).

 **Violation**:  
- **Incorrect order**: "Package items" before "Authorize payment".  
- This breaks the rule that packaging must occur **after** payment authorization.

---

### **Case 3**

| Activity Sequence | Receive  Check  Authorize  **Cancel  Ship  Close** |

- **Violation 1**:  
  - After "Authorize payment", the process goes to "Cancel order".  
  - This suggests the order was canceled **after** payment was authorized.  
  - While the normative description doesn't explicitly forbid this, it implies that **cancellation occurs only when inventory is insufficient**, and **payment should not be authorized in such cases**.  
  - Authorizing payment and then canceling is illogical unless a refund is involved—but the normative process does not mention refunds or post-authorization cancellations.

- **Violation 2 (More Severe)**:  
  - After "Cancel order", the process proceeds to **"Ship order"**.
  - The normative description explicitly states:  
    > *"Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.*

  - **Shipping after cancellation is a clear violation**.  
  - It makes no logical sense to ship an order that has been canceled.

- **Violation 3**:  
  - "Package items" is **missing** between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".  
  - The rule: *"Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping* — so packaging is **required** before shipping.

 **Violations**:
1. "Ship order" occurs **after "Cancel order"** — **major violation**.
2. "Package items" is **missing** — required before shipping.
3. "Cancel order" after "Authorize payment" — **questionable logic**, possibly acceptable only with refund, but not supported by normative process.

### **Case 4**

| Activity Sequence | Receive  Check  Cancel  Close |

- **Analysis**:
  - Starts correctly.
  - "Check inventory" occurs early.
  - Inventory insufficient  leads to "Cancel order".
  - Then "Close order" — final activity.
  - No fulfillment activities after cancellation.
  - All steps in correct order.

 **No violation**.

---

### **Case 5**

| Activity Sequence | Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship  Close** |

- **Violation**:
  - "Ship order" occurs **without "Package items"**.
  - According to the normative process:  
    > *"Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped.*

  - **Packaging is a required step** before shipping.
  - Skipping it violates the process flow.

 **Violation**:
- **Missing activity**: "Package items" is **absent** between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".

###  **Summary of Violations**

| Case | Compliant? | Explanation of Violation(s) |
|------|------------|-----------------------------|
| **1** |  Yes | Full correct sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close |
| **2** |  No | **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"** — violates ordering constraint. |
| **3** |  No | **Multiple violations**: <br> - "Cancel order" after "Authorize payment" (illogical) <br> - "Ship order" **after cancellation** — major violation <br> - "Package items" **missing** before shipping |
| **4** |  Yes | Correct cancellation path: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close |
| **5** |  No | **"Package items" is missing** — cannot ship without packaging. |

---

###  **Final Answer**

**Cases that violate the normative process: Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5.**

#### **Detailed Violations**:

- **Case 2**:
  - **Violation**: "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment".
  - **Rule broken**: Payment must be authorized **before** packaging items.

- **Case 3**:
  - **Violation 1**: "Ship order" occurs **after** "Cancel order".
    - **Rule broken**: Shipping must **never** occur after cancellation.
  - **Violation 2**: "Package items" is **missing** before shipping.
    - **Rule broken**: Packaging is required between authorization and shipping.
  - **Violation 3**: Cancellation after payment authorization — **illogical flow**, implies flawed decision-making, not supported by normative process.

- **Case 5**:
  - **Violation**: "Package items" is **missing** entirely.
  - **Rule broken**: Items must be packaged before shipping.

---

###  **Conclusion**

The normative process expects:
- Strict ordering based on inventory check results.
- No fulfillment after cancellation.
- Mandatory intermediate steps (e.g., packaging).
- Logical dependency between payment and inventory.

**Deviating cases: 2, 3, and 5.**  
**Compliant cases: 1 and 4.**
