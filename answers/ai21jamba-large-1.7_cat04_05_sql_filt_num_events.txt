You could structure your DuckDB SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

This query first identifies case_ids that meet the criteria using a subquery (with a `HAVING` clause), then filters the event_log table to only return events from those cases.
