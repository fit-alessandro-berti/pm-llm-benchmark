Here is the DuckDB SQL query that meets the specified requirements:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM (
    SELECT case_id,
           COUNT(*) as event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
  ) AS event_counts
  WHERE event_count <= 6
)
```
Here's a brief explanation of the query:

1. The subquery in the `IN` clause uses `GROUP BY` to count the number of events per `case_id` in the `event_log` table.
2. It filters out any `case_id` with more than six events by using the `WHERE` clause.
3. The outer query then selects all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` table, but only for the `case_id`s that were retained by the subquery.

Note that this query uses a subquery to count the events per `case_id` and then filters the main query based on the results of the subquery. This approach ensures that we correctly exclude cases with more than six events while still returning the full set of events for the remaining cases.
