Here’s a practical, endtoend narrative of the loan approval process implied by the DECLARE model, followed by how each constraint shapes behavior, why it matters in the real world, and what could go wrong if steps are skipped or reordered.

End-to-end process narrative

1) Intake and kickoff
- The process must start with Receive_Application (init, existence). A customer submits an application, which triggers the internal workflow.

2) Immediate risk screening
- After receiving the application, the organization must perform exactly one Preliminary_Credit_Check (response from Receive_Application to Preliminary_Credit_Check, and exactly_one).
- This ensures the applicant’s baseline creditworthiness is assessed once and only once before moving further.

3) Collecting evidence
- After the preliminary credit check, the process must gather required supporting materials (succession: Preliminary_Credit_Check  Gather_Additional_Documents). Examples: income proof, identification, employment verification.

4) Document-package assembly path (interlocking dependencies)
- Gather_Additional_Documents requires that Authorize_Contract_Terms also occurs at some point (coexistence). This means cases with document collection must also include authorization later—no “collect but never decide” cases.
- After documents are gathered, a Quality_Assurance_Review must eventually occur in relation to Authorize_Contract_Terms and offer assembly (several constraints drive this sequence):
  • Quality_Assurance_Review must be preceded by Authorize_Contract_Terms (precedence: QA Review  Authorize Terms). Interpreting precedence in DECLARE: the target (Authorize_Contract_Terms) must happen before the source (Quality_Assurance_Review).
  • However, we also have chainprecedence: Authorize_Contract_Terms must be directly preceded by Preliminary_Credit_Check. This tightens the ordering: Credit Check  (directly) Authorize_Contract_Terms.
  • There is chainsuccession from Quality_Assurance_Review to Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package (QA Review  directly Assemble Package). So, immediately after QA passes, the offer package is assembled—no unrelated step in between.
  • There is responded_existence requiring that if Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package happens, then Quality_Assurance_Review must also occur (responded_existence: Assemble  QA Review). This enforces that you can’t assemble an offer without a QA review in the case.
  • There’s also altsuccession from Gather_Additional_Documents to Quality_Assurance_Review, which in typical DECLARE means every occurrence of the source must be followed by one of a set of allowed targets (here only QA). Practically: once documents are gathered, the case must eventually reach a QA review, aligning with the overall flow.

Putting those together, the realistic sequence after the credit check is:
- Exactly one Preliminary_Credit_Check
- Directly then Authorize_Contract_Terms (chainprecedence)
- Later Quality_Assurance_Review (precedence ensures authorization happens before QA)
- Immediately then Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package (chainsuccession)

5) Disbursement and customer communication
- After assembling the offer package, Transfer_Funds must occur immediately (chainresponse: Assemble  directly Transfer_Funds). This encodes that once the final package is assembled, disbursement follows without intervening steps.
- After Transfer_Funds, the customer must be notified (altresponse: Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer). In effect, funds disbursal requires subsequent notification.
- The model also requires an altprecedence link: Notify_Customer must be preceded by Transfer_Funds. Combined with the altresponse above, this pairs the two events: if you transfer funds, you must notify, and if you notify, it must come after a transfer. This effectively binds notification to disbursement events and prevents premature notifications.

6) Forbidden or blocked patterns
- Proceed_Without_Compliance must never occur (absence). This represents a hard prohibition against bypassing required controls.
- Transfer_Funds must not coexist with Receive_Application (noncoexistence). This prevents any case where funds disbursement and initial intake both appear—i.e., you cannot have disbursement in the same stage/context as intake, ensuring separation of early and late stages or possibly separate sub-cases. Practically, this enforces that disbursement cannot occur in cases that never progressed beyond application intake; the case must evolve beyond the intake-only phase to reach disbursement.
- Notify_Customer must not be followed by Preliminary_Credit_Check (nonsuccession). This prevents notifying the customer and then stepping backward to do a credit check—no “post-notice retroactive screening.”
- Authorize_Contract_Terms must not be immediately followed by Notify_Customer (nonchainsuccession). This prohibits skipping steps between authorization and notification (e.g., you can’t authorize and immediately notify without QA, assembly, and funds transfer in between).

How each constraint enforces order and compliance

1) init + existence (Receive_Application)
- Ensures every case has a clear start and cannot proceed without a valid application. Motivations: traceability, auditability, regulatory intake requirements (KYC/AML begins at intake).

2) exactly_one (Preliminary_Credit_Check)
- Prevents multiple, potentially conflicting credit checks that could lead to inconsistent risk assessments or decision fatigue. Motivations: risk management integrity, reproducibility of decisions, model governance.

3) response and succession (Receive_Application  Preliminary_Credit_Check; Preliminary_Credit_Check  Gather_Additional_Documents)
- Forces immediate progression to initial risk screening and then to gathering proofs. Motivations: reduce unnecessary work on unqualified applications; obtain evidence only if initial risk warrants further processing.

4) chainprecedence (Authorize_Contract_Terms directly after Preliminary_Credit_Check)
- Tight coupling between the credit decision basis and the authorization of terms. Motivations: ensure terms are based on the most recent credit picture without intervening steps that might make terms stale or misaligned.

5) precedence (Authorize_Contract_Terms before Quality_Assurance_Review)
- QA reviews the authorized package rather than pre-authorization drafts. Motivations: QA checks what will actually go to the customer, improving control effectiveness.

6) chainsuccession (Quality_Assurance_Review immediately followed by Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package)
- Once QA approves, the team proceeds straight to building the final package—no drift or tampering. Motivations: prevents post-QA changes that might invalidate the review; supports version control and compliance.

7) responded_existence (Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package implies Quality_Assurance_Review exists)
- You can’t assemble a package without there being a QA review in the case. Motivations: compliance, product governance, error prevention.

8) chainresponse (Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package directly leads to Transfer_Funds)
- Eliminates delays and reduces risk of discrepancy between the package and what is funded. Motivations: operational efficiency, consistent customer experience, reduced fraud risk in the window between offer and funding.

9) altresponse + altprecedence (Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer)
- Enforces that notification is tied to actual disbursement. No premature or missing customer communications. Motivations: customer satisfaction, regulatory disclosures, service-level commitments.

10) coexistence (Gather_Additional_Documents coexists with Authorize_Contract_Terms)
- If you collect documents, you must also perform authorization in the case. Motivations: avoid “document collection without resolution”; throughput discipline.

11) noncoexistence (Transfer_Funds with Receive_Application)
- Prevents any case where the process jumps from intake directly to funding. Motivations: strong control against accidental or fraudulent instant funding.

12) nonsuccession (Notify_Customer not followed by Preliminary_Credit_Check)
- Prevents going backward after communicating outcomes. Motivations: avoid customer confusion, maintain decision integrity.

13) nonchainsuccession (Authorize_Contract_Terms not immediately followed by Notify_Customer)
- Forces intermediate controls (QA, assembly, funding) to occur before notification. Motivations: ensure notification reflects the final, executed state (funded or not), not an intermediate authorization.

Real-world motivations

- Regulatory compliance: Ensures KYC/AML, fair lending, and disclosure timing rules are respected. QA acts as an internal compliance gate before any customer-facing outcome is finalized.
- Fraud prevention: Enforced order keeps bad actors from exploiting gaps—e.g., preventing funding before proper checks.
- Risk management: Exactly-one credit check and tight coupling of authorization with that check maintain consistency and traceability of credit decisions.
- Operational best practices: Direct links (chain constraints) reduce cycle time, handoffs, and rework; coexistence and responded-existence avoid dangling or incomplete cases.
- Customer satisfaction: Timely, accurate notification only after real outcomes (funding) avoids confusion and retractions.

What could go wrong if order is violated or steps are omitted

- Skipping the preliminary credit check or doing it multiple times: Could lead to lending to unqualified applicants or inconsistent decisions, increasing default risk and regulatory scrutiny.
- Transferring funds before QA or authorization: High exposure to errors, mispriced loans, or non-compliant terms; potential fines, clawbacks, reputational damage.
- Not collecting documents before authorization: Risk of approving on insufficient evidence; higher fraud risk and repurchase risk if loans are sold.
- Notifying before funding or authorizing: Customer confusion, complaints, potential UDAAP issues (unfair or deceptive acts/practices).
- Performing Notify_Customer and then going back to Preliminary_Credit_Check: Mixed signals to the customer; undermines trust and auditability.
- Proceed_Without_Compliance: Represents a hard breach—could trigger regulatory violations, audit findings, and severe financial/operational penalties.
- Funding in the same “stage” as Receive_Application (noncoexistence breach): Suggests a control breakdown where critical steps were bypassed; likely a systemic issue requiring incident response.

In short, the DECLARE model encodes a rigorous, auditable flow: Application  Credit Check (exactly once)  Authorization (directly after the check)  QA Review  Assemble Package (immediately)  Transfer Funds (immediately)  Notify Customer, with guardrails preventing illegal skips, backtracking, or premature actions. This aligns well with strong compliance, effective risk control, and a clear customer journey.
