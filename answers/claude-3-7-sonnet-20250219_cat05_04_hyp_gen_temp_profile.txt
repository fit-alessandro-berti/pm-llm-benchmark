# Analysis of Insurance Claim Processing Temporal Anomalies

After examining the temporal profile model for the insurance claim handling process, I've identified several concerning anomalies in the timing between activities. These timing patterns suggest potential process inefficiencies or compliance issues that warrant further investigation.

## Identified Anomalies

### 1. Suspiciously Consistent Approval Timing (R → P)
The average time from Receive to Approve is approximately 25 hours (90,000 seconds) with an unusually low standard deviation of just 1 hour. This rigid timing suggests an artificial or predetermined approval schedule rather than genuine case-by-case evaluation.

### 2. Excessive Delay in Customer Notification (P → N)
There's an alarming 7-day average delay between Approve and Notify with a 2-day standard deviation. This represents a significant customer experience issue and potential compliance risk.

### 3. Premature Claim Closure (A → C)
The average time between Assign and Close is only 2 hours, suggesting some claims may be closed immediately after assignment without proper evaluation or approval steps.

### 4. Rushed Evaluation Notification (E → N)
Only 5 minutes on average between Evaluate and Notify indicates potentially inadequate review time or automated notifications that may not reflect thorough evaluation.

## Hypotheses for Anomalies

### For R → P (Consistent Approval Timing)
1. **Batch Processing**: Claims might be collected throughout the day but processed in a single batch exactly 24 hours later.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Adjusters may be adhering to strict SLAs that require approval within 24-26 hours.
3. **Automated Approvals**: Low-risk or low-value claims might be automatically approved by a system that runs on a fixed schedule.

### For P → N (Delayed Notification)
1. **Resource Constraints**: Insufficient staff handling notifications creates a backlog.
2. **System Integration Issues**: Approval and notification systems may not be properly integrated, requiring manual intervention.
3. **Intentional Delay**: The company might be deliberately delaying notifications to manage cash flow or allow time for internal reviews.

### For A → C (Premature Closure)
1. **Claim Abandonment**: Claims might be closed without proper processing if they're deemed invalid upon initial review.
2. **Misclassification**: Some activities might not be properly recorded, skipping intermediate steps in the database.
3. **Adjuster Performance Incentives**: Adjusters might be incentivized to close claims quickly to improve performance metrics.

### For E → N (Rushed Evaluation Notification)
1. **Automated Notifications**: System might automatically send notifications immediately after evaluation data is entered.
2. **Incomplete Process**: The evaluation might be marked as complete before the actual assessment is finished.
3. **Timestamp Errors**: The timestamps might be recorded incorrectly due to system or user error.

## SQL Verification Queries

### 1. Identify Claims with Rigid Approval Timing

```sql
WITH claim_activities AS (
  SELECT 
    c1.claim_id,
    c1.timestamp AS receive_time,
    c2.timestamp AS approve_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c2.timestamp - c1.timestamp)) AS seconds_between
  FROM claim_events c1
  JOIN claim_events c2 ON c1.claim_id = c2.claim_id
  WHERE c1.activity = 'R' AND c2.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  receive_time,
  approve_time,
  seconds_between / 3600 AS hours_between,
  ABS(seconds_between - 90000) / 3600 AS hours_deviation_from_avg
FROM claim_activities
WHERE ABS(seconds_between - 90000) < 1800  -- Within 30 minutes of the average
ORDER BY hours_deviation_from_avg
LIMIT 100;
```

### 2. Investigate Delayed Customer Notifications

```sql
WITH notification_delays AS (
  SELECT 
    c1.claim_id,
    claims.claim_type,
    claims.claim_amount,
    c1.timestamp AS approve_time,
    c2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    c2.resource AS notifier,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c2.timestamp - c1.timestamp)) / 86400 AS days_between
  FROM claim_events c1
  JOIN claim_events c2 ON c1.claim_id = c2.claim_id
  JOIN claims ON c1.claim_id = claims.claim_id
  WHERE c1.activity = 'P' AND c2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  claim_type,
  claim_amount,
  approve_time,
  notify_time,
  notifier,
  days_between,
  CASE 
    WHEN days_between > 10 THEN 'Severe Delay'
    WHEN days_between > 7 THEN 'Significant Delay'
    WHEN days_between < 1 THEN 'Unusually Fast'
    ELSE 'Normal'
  END AS delay_category
FROM notification_delays
ORDER BY days_between DESC;
```

### 3. Examine Prematurely Closed Claims

```sql
WITH quick_closures AS (
  SELECT 
    c1.claim_id,
    claims.claim_type,
    claims.claim_amount,
    adj.name AS adjuster_name,
    adj.specialization,
    c1.timestamp AS assign_time,
    c2.timestamp AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c2.timestamp - c1.timestamp)) / 60 AS minutes_between,
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM claim_events 
      WHERE claim_id = c1.claim_id AND activity = 'E'
    ) AS has_evaluation,
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM claim_events 
      WHERE claim_id = c1.claim_id AND activity = 'P'
    ) AS has_approval
  FROM claim_events c1
  JOIN claim_events c2 ON c1.claim_id = c2.claim_id
  JOIN claims ON c1.claim_id = claims.claim_id
  JOIN adjusters adj ON c1.resource = adj.name
  WHERE c1.activity = 'A' AND c2.activity = 'C'
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  claim_type,
  claim_amount,
  adjuster_name,
  specialization,
  assign_time,
  close_time,
  minutes_between,
  has_evaluation,
  has_approval
FROM quick_closures
WHERE minutes_between < 120  -- Less than 2 hours
ORDER BY minutes_between;
```

### 4. Analyze Rushed Evaluation Notifications

```sql
WITH rushed_notifications AS (
  SELECT 
    c1.claim_id,
    claims.claim_type,
    claims.claim_amount,
    c1.resource AS evaluator,
    c2.resource AS notifier,
    c1.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
    c2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c2.timestamp - c1.timestamp)) AS seconds_between
  FROM claim_events c1
  JOIN claim_events c2 ON c1.claim_id = c2.claim_id
  JOIN claims ON c1.claim_id = claims.claim_id
  WHERE c1.activity = 'E' AND c2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  claim_type,
  claim_amount,
  evaluator,
  notifier,
  evaluate_time,
  notify_time,
  seconds_between,
  CASE WHEN evaluator = notifier THEN 'Same Person' ELSE 'Different People' END AS resource_pattern
FROM rushed_notifications
WHERE seconds_between < 300  -- Less than 5 minutes
ORDER BY seconds_between;
```

### 5. Identify Process Compliance by Adjuster

```sql
WITH adjuster_patterns AS (
  SELECT 
    adj.adjuster_id,
    adj.name,
    adj.specialization,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ce.claim_id) AS total_claims,
    SUM(CASE WHEN 
      EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'E') AND
      EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'P')
    THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS compliant_claims
  FROM adjusters adj
  JOIN claim_events ce ON adj.name = ce.resource
  WHERE ce.activity = 'A'  -- Assigned to this adjuster
  GROUP BY adj.adjuster_id, adj.name, adj.specialization
)
SELECT 
  adjuster_id,
  name,
  specialization,
  total_claims,
  compliant_claims,
  ROUND((compliant_claims::numeric / total_claims) * 100, 2) AS compliance_percentage
FROM adjuster_patterns
WHERE total_claims > 10  -- Minimum sample size
ORDER BY compliance_percentage;
```

These queries should help identify specific instances of the anomalies and determine whether they're isolated incidents or systematic issues. The results can guide process improvements and compliance measures to ensure proper claim handling.
