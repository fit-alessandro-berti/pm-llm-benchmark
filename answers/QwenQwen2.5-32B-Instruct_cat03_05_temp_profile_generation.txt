Sure, here is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the given activities in the global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics. The dictionary includes a representative subset of activity pairs with estimated average times and standard deviations, including pairs that may be separated by multiple steps:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (129600, 43200),       # Supplier Selection to Order Placement
    ('OP', 'RC'): (864000, 86400),       # Order Placement to Receive Components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (14400, 3600),         # Receive Components to Quality Inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (7200, 1800),          # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 5400),         # Component Assembly to Product Testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 1800),          # Product Testing to Packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 900),           # Packaging to Warehouse Storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (43200, 10800),        # Warehouse Storage to Distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 864000),     # Distribution to After-Sales Support
    ('SS', 'QI'): (972000, 144000),      # Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection
    ('OP', 'PT'): (885600, 144000),      # Order Placement to Product Testing
    ('RC', 'PK'): (32400, 5400),         # Receive Components to Packaging
    ('QI', 'WS'): (32400, 7200),         # Quality Inspection to Warehouse Storage
    ('CA', 'DT'): (28800, 7200),         # Component Assembly to Distribution
    ('PT', 'AS'): (2678400, 864000)      # Product Testing to After-Sales Support
}
```
