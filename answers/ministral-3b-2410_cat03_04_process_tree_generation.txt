Certainly! Below is a Python code example that constructs a process tree for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process using the `pm4py` framework. This example includes various operators and activities to represent the different steps in the P2P process.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Create the root process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Define the 'Purchase' process tree
purchase = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, label="Purchase")
purchase.children.append(ProcessTree(label="Review Requirements"))
purchase.children.append(ProcessTree(label="Place Order"))

# Define the 'Payment' process tree
payment = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, label="Payment")
payment.children.append(ProcessTree(label="Generate Invoice"))
payment.children.append(ProcessTree(label="Process Payment"))

# Define the 'Receiving' process tree
receiving = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, label="Receiving")
receiving.children.append(ProcessTree(label="Confirm Delivery"))
receiving.children.append(ProcessTree(label="Accept Goods"))

# Define the 'Due Diligence' process tree
due_diligence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, label="Due Diligence")
due_diligence.children.append(ProcessTree(label="Audit Payment"))
due_diligence.children.append(ProcessTree(label="Audit Delivery"))

# Add the above process trees as children to the root process tree
root.children.append(purchase)
root.children.append(payment)
root.children.append(receiving)
root.children.append(due_diligence)

# Example usage of the process tree
print(root)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Root Process Tree**: The root process tree is a parallel process because it involves multiple independent but simultaneous processes (purchase, payment, receiving, and due diligence).
2. **Purchase Process Tree**: This sequence has two activities: "Review Requirements" and "Place Order".
3. **Payment Process Tree**: This sequence involves generating an invoice and processing the payment.
4. **Receiving Process Tree**: This sequence includes confirming delivery and accepting goods.
5. **Due Diligence Process Tree**: This sequence includes auditing the payment and delivery.

### Execution:
- Each process tree (`Purchase`, `Payment`, `Receiving`, `Due Diligence`) is defined with a sequence operator (`Operator.SEQUENCE`) and its respective activities as children.
- The root process tree (`root`) has each of these process trees as its children.

You can run this code to create the process tree for the P2P process using `pm4py`. The `print(root)` statement will give you an overview of the constructed process tree.
