The Group B log (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias via favorable score adjustments tied to LocalResident = TRUE and membership in a specific CommunityGroup.

What’s happening:
1) Community-based score boosts only in Group B:
- In Group B, applicants linked to “Highland Civic Darts Club” receive a +10 “Community Boost” in PreliminaryScoring, which carries through ManualReview and FinalDecision (e.g., U001: 720  730; U003: 695  705).
- In Group A, there are no positive adjustments; ScoreAdjustment is 0 throughout for comparable cases with similar baseline scores.

2) Systematic impact on outcomes:
- At similar preliminary scores, boosted Group B cases are more likely to be approved:
  • 720 baseline: P001 (A) Approved with no boost; U001 (B) Approved with +10 boost (730).
  • 710 baseline: P002 (A) Rejected; U002 (B) Rejected (no boost).
  • Sub-threshold scores: U003 (B) at 695 becomes 705 with boost and is Approved; Group A has no analogous mechanism to lift near-cutoff applicants across the decision threshold.

3) Role of LocalResident and CommunityGroup:
- The community boost appears contingent on CommunityGroup membership, which occurs only among LocalResident = TRUE in Group B.
- Group A applicants are all LocalResident = FALSE and have no CommunityGroup; they never receive boosts.
- This creates a structural advantage for being both a local resident and a member of a particular community group—attributes disproportionately present in Group B.

Why this is bias:
- The scoring/decision pipeline treats similarly qualified applicants differently based on non-merit attributes (LocalResident/CommunityGroup), leading to higher adjusted scores and approvals for Group B members.
- The effect is material at decision thresholds, as seen with U003’s approval despite a lower baseline than some Group A approvals.

Conclusion:
The bias resides in Group B’s use of a “Community Boost” tied to LocalResident and CommunityGroup status. This preferential adjustment systematically improves final decisions for Group B applicants and is absent for Group A, producing disparate outcomes not explained by underlying preliminary scores alone.
