Below is an example of how to implement a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using the pm4py library.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the nodes
receive_request = Transition(label="Receive Request")
approve_request = Transition(label="Approve Request")
order_goods = Transition(label="Order Goods")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
invoice_provider = Transition(label="Invoice Provider")
pay_invoice = Transition(label="Pay Invoice")
return_goods = Transition(label="Return Goods")

# Define a silent transition for handling errors
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define a loop for handling goods receipt
receipt_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[receive_goods, return_goods])

# Define a choice for handling payment
payment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[pay_invoice, skip])

# Define the partial order
process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[order_goods, receipt_loop]),
    OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[invoice_provider, payment_choice])
])

# Add the order between elements
process.order.add_edge(receipt_loop, payment_choice)
process.order.add_edge(OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[order_goods, receipt_loop]), payment_choice)

# Print the POWL model
print(process)
```

This code models the Purchase-to-Pay process as a POWL model, with the following steps:

- Receive a request (Receive Request)
- Approve the request (Approve Request)
- Order goods (Order Goods)
- Receive goods (Receive Goods) - this step has a loop, allowing for the possibility of returning goods
- Invoice the provider (Invoice Provider)
- Pay the invoice (Pay Invoice) - this step has a choice, allowing for the possibility of skipping payment

The POWL model is defined as a StrictPartialOrder, with a set of nodes that are ordered using the `.order.add_edge()` method. The order between elements is defined as follows:

- The receipt loop (Receive Goods, Return Goods) must be completed before payment can be made
- The order goods choice (Order Goods, Receipt Loop) must be completed before payment can be made
- The invoice provider choice (Invoice Provider, Payment Choice) must be completed after the order goods choice has been
