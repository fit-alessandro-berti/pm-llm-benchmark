Here's a Python code that creates a POWL model for the Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
receive_po = Transition(label="Receive PO")
approve_po = Transition(label="Approve PO")
prepare_invoice = Transition(label="Prepare Invoice")
send_invoice = Transition(label="Send Invoice")
receive_payment = Transition(label="Receive Payment")

# Define a silent activity (no label or operator)
processing_payment = SilentTransition()

# Define a loop between two activities (PO receiving and approval)
loop_po_approval = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[receive_po, approve_po])

# Define a choice between two activities (send invoice and receive payment)
send_invoice_or_receive_payment = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR, children=[send_invoice, receive_payment, processing_payment])

# Define a partial order between the loop, the choice, and the silent activity
purchase_to_pay = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[loop_po_approval, send_invoice_or_receive_payment, processing_payment])

# Define the partial order between activities
purchase_to_pay.order.add_edge(loop_po_approval, send_invoice_or_receive_payment)
# You should also establish order between receive_payment and the other nodes, but without sufficient context, that might be anything from independent to a dependency on all previous nodes.
```
This Python code creates a POWL model for a Purchase-to-Pay process, including the steps of receiving a Purchase Order (PO), approving it, preparing the invoice, sending it, and eventually receiving the payment information. Note that you might need to adjust the order between activities according to the actual process you're trying to model.
