Sure, here is a Python code snippet that uses pm4py to create a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the transitions
start_transition = Transition(label="Start")
purchase_transition = Transition(label="Purchase")
pay_transition = Transition(label="Pay")
confirmation_transition = Transition(label="Confirmation")
end_transition = Transition(label="End")

# Define the silent transition
silent_transition = SilentTransition()

# Define the operators
choice_operator = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[pay_transition, silent_transition])
loop_operator = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[purchase_transition, confirmation_transition])

# Define the main process
purchase_to_pay_process = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[start_transition, loop_operator, end_transition])

# Define the partial order
purchase_to_pay_process.order.add_edge(start_transition, loop_operator)
purchase_to_pay_process.order.add_edge(loop_operator, choice_operator)
purchase_to_pay_process.order.add_edge(choice_operator, end_transition)

print(purchase_to_pay_process)
```

This code creates a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. The process starts with a transition labeled "Start", followed by a loop operator that contains two transitions: "Purchase" and "Confirmation". After the loop, there is a choice operator that either goes to a transition labeled "Pay" or a silent transition. Finally, there is a transition labeled "End". The partial order is defined such that the process starts with the "Start" transition, then moves to the loop operator, then either the "Pay" or silent transition, and finally ends with the "End" transition.
