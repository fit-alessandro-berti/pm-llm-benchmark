Below is a detailed analysis of both POWL models, focusing on how they compare to a standard Hire-to-Retire process, the anomalies they introduce, and which one more closely aligns with a normative workflow.

### The Standard Hire-to-Retire Process

A typical Hire-to-Retire process in its most canonical form often follows a sequence like this:

1. **Post Job Advertisement** – Publicize the job opening.
2. **Screen Candidates** – Review resumes and shortlist viable candidates.
3. **Conduct Interviews** – Interview shortlisted candidates to assess their suitability.
4. **Make Hiring Decision** – Decide which candidate(s) to hire based on interview outcomes.
5. **Onboard Employee** – Bring the new hire into the organization (e.g., orientation, system access, equipment setup).
6. **Add to Payroll** – Ensure the new hire is properly registered in the payroll system.
7. **Close Case** – Conclude the hiring process, finalizing documentation and records.

This sequence is logically strict in certain respects: interviews must inform the hiring decision; onboarding should not be optional if a decision to hire is made; and payroll setup should follow onboarding for the successful candidate.

### Analysis of Model 1

**POWL Model 1:**
``` 
Post_Job_Ad -> Screen_Candidates -> { Make_Hiring_Decision, Conduct_Interviews } -> Onboard_Employee -> Add_to_Payroll -> Close_Case
```

Edges in Model 1:  
- Post → Screen  
- Screen → Decide  
- Screen → Interview  
- Decide → Onboard  
- Onboard → Payroll  
- Payroll → Close

**Key Observations:**

1. **Parallel/Non-Sequential Relationship Between Interview and Decision**:  
   After screening candidates, the model shows that both "Make_Hiring_Decision" and "Conduct_Interviews" follow from "Screen_Candidates" without a defined order. This implies that the hiring decision could be made either before or after conducting interviews, or even in parallel. In a real hiring process, it is logically fundamental that interviews precede the decision. Interviews are the primary input to making an informed hiring choice.  
   - **Anomaly:** The absence of a guaranteed ordering between "Conduct_Interviews" and "Make_Hiring_Decision" is a severe logical violation. It undermines the core rationale of the process, as making a hiring decision without conducting interviews first is nonsensical.

2. **Otherwise Structurally Sound Sequence Post-Decision**:
   Once a decision is made (whenever that may be), the process returns to a more normative flow: Onboarding precedes Payroll, and Payroll precedes Closing the case. These steps align with standard practice but are overshadowed by the critical ordering flaw in the decision-making phase.

**Severity of Anomalies in Model 1**:  
The principal anomaly is severe: it directly conflicts with the logical dependencies of a hiring process. If hiring is decided without input from interviews, the process loses its integrity at its core decision-making stage.

### Analysis of Model 2

**POWL Model 2:**
``` 
Post_Job_Ad -> {Screen_Candidates, Conduct_Interviews} -> Make_Hiring_Decision -> Loop(Onboard_Employee or skip) -> XOR(Add_to_Payroll or skip) -> Close_Case
```

Edges in Model 2:  
- Post → Screen  
- Post → Interview  
- Interview → Decide  
- Decide → loop_onboarding (Onboard_Employee, skip)  
- loop_onboarding → xor_payroll (Add_to_Payroll, skip)  
- xor_payroll → Close

**Key Observations:**

1. **Parallel/Concurrent Screening and Interviewing**:  
   Both "Screen_Candidates" and "Conduct_Interviews" branches stem from posting the job ad. This suggests that interviews could start without completely finishing the screening. While not entirely normative, it does not preclude the screening from influencing interview selection if both are partially overlapping. Some organizations might conduct certain parts of interviews in parallel with continued screening, though this is less standard.  
   - **Minor Anomaly:** The parallel start of interviewing and screening is unusual, but it does not inherently prevent a logical decision. Screening and interviewing might proceed in tandem, albeit this is not the classic sequence.

2. **Correct Logical Ordering of Decision-Making**:  
   Crucially, "Make_Hiring_Decision" is dependent on "Conduct_Interviews." You must finish conducting interviews before deciding. This preserves a core logical sequence: decision informed by interviews. This is an improvement over Model 1’s anomaly.

3. **Optional and Repetitive Structures After Decision**:  
   After the decision, the model introduces a loop that includes "Onboard_Employee" and a skip transition. The loop suggests multiple iterations of onboarding or the possibility of skipping it altogether. Similarly, an XOR structure allows either performing "Add_to_Payroll" or skipping it.  
   - **Anomalies:**  
     - **Onboarding might be skipped:** Once a candidate is selected, skipping onboarding makes little sense. This conflicts with best practices, as onboarding is essential to integrate the new hire.  
     - **Payroll might be skipped:** Paying a new employee should not be optional. If the decision is to hire, adding the new hire to the payroll system is a mandatory step. Skipping payroll indicates a serious, though perhaps less logically fundamental, procedural gap.  
     - **Loop on onboarding:** Unless hiring multiple candidates is intended, repeatedly onboarding doesn't align well with a typical single-candidate hire scenario. This may represent a less common variant (hiring multiple employees in a batch), but in a standard single-hire scenario, it’s odd.

**Severity of Anomalies in Model 2**:  
The anomalies here center around post-decision flexibility. While serious from a compliance and procedural standpoint, these steps represent after-the-fact procedural lapses (e.g., not onboarding or not adding to payroll) rather than violating the core logic of how a hiring decision is reached.

### Which Model Is More Normative?

- **Model 1’s Core Logical Flaw**: In Model 1, the process might produce hiring decisions without the input of interviews. This fundamentally breaks the intended logic of a hiring workflow. Such a violation is severe because it strikes at the very heart of what a hiring process is supposed to accomplish: making informed decisions based on candidate assessments.

- **Model 2’s Procedural Deviations**: In Model 2, the interviews still inform the decision, maintaining essential logical integrity. The anomalies (skipping onboarding and payroll) occur after the decision, making them more akin to procedural oversights or design flaws rather than fundamental logical contradictions. One could rationalize the skipping behavior as accommodating exceptional cases (e.g., no suitable candidate was ultimately hired, so onboarding and payroll are not applicable), even though it’s not the ideal modeling choice.

### Conclusion

While both models deviate from the standard Hire-to-Retire process, **Model 2** more closely aligns with a normative version of the hiring logic. It preserves the crucial dependency of making a hiring decision only after conducting interviews. The anomalies in Model 2, though serious, occur post-decision and could be interpreted as representing exceptional or less common scenarios (such as not ultimately hiring any candidate).

By contrast, Model 1’s anomaly directly undermines the fundamental logical flow of the hiring process—allowing a decision before interviews is completed is a more severe, irreparable violation of process integrity. Therefore, **Model 2** is the one that more closely aligns with a standard Hire-to-Retire process, despite its own flaws.
