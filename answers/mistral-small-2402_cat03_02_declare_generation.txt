Sure, I can provide an example of a DECLARE model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. In this process, we might have activities such as "Purchase Order", "Invoice Receipt", "Payment Approval", and "Payment". Here's a simple example:

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {'Purchase Order': (1.0, 1.0), 'Invoice Receipt': (1.0, 1.0), 'Payment Approval': (1.0, 1.0), 'Payment': (1.0, 1.0)},
    'init': {'Purchase Order': (1.0, 1.0)},
    'response': {('Purchase Order', 'Invoice Receipt'): (1.0, 1.0), ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Approval'): (1.0, 1.0), ('Payment Approval', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0)},
    'precedence': {('Invoice Receipt', 'Purchase Order'): (1.0, 1.0), ('Payment Approval', 'Invoice Receipt'): (1.0, 1.0), ('Payment', 'Payment Approval'): (1.0, 1.0)},
    'succession': {('Purchase Order', 'Invoice Receipt'): (1.0, 1.0), ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Approval'): (1.0, 1.0), ('Payment Approval', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0)},
    'chainresponse': {('Purchase Order', 'Invoice Receipt'): (1.0, 1.0), ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Approval'): (1.0, 1.0), ('Payment Approval', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0)},
    'noncoexistence': {('Purchase Order', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0)}
}
```

In this model, we declare that each activity must exist at least once, the process starts with a "Purchase Order", and there is a clear sequence of activities: "Purchase Order", "Invoice Receipt", "Payment Approval", and finally "Payment". Also, "Purchase Order" and "Payment" should not co-exist, meaning that a payment should not be made before the purchase order is issued.
