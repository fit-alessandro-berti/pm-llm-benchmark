Based on the given event log behavior, a simplified yet comprehensive process tree can be designed as follows:

1. **Root Process Tree**: Representing the overall workflow.
2. **Sequence (Receive Application)**: The first activity in every case is receiving an application.
3. **Loop for Request Missing Info and Validate Form**:
   - This loop includes two operations: `Request Missing Info` and `Validate Form`.
   - These actions can be performed multiple times until the process tree structure indicates otherwise.
4. **Sequence (Assess Eligibility, Validate Form)**: Followed by assessing eligibility then validating form again.
5. **Optional Sequence for Approval Decision**:
   - This sequence depends on whether a `Request Missing Info` operation was performed.
6. **Sequence (Approval Decision, Send Confirmation, Archive Case)**: The final sequence of activities leading to case closure.

Here's the process tree representation:

```plaintext
+ ('Receive Application', ->('RA1', 'RA2'))
  + ('Validate Form', 'RM1')
    -> ('Request Missing Info', 'VF1')
      + ('Validate Form', 'VF2') // Loop here until no more missing info requested or validated form available
    + ('Assess Eligibility', 'AE1')
      + ('Validate Form', 'VA1') // Validate form again after assessment
  + ('Assess Eligibility', 'AE2')
    + ('Validate Form', 'VF3')
  -> ('Approval Decision', 'AD1')
    + ('Send Confirmation', 'SC1')
    + ('Archive Case', 'AC1')
```

### Explanation:

- **'Receive Application (RA)'**: The process starts with receiving an application in every case.
- **Loop for Missing Info and Validate Form (`RM1`, `VF1`, `VA1`)**: 
  - Optionally, the missing info is requested (`Request Missing Info (RM1)`), followed by a validation of the form (`Validate Form (VF1)`).
  - The loop can repeat until there's no more missing info or an additional validation of the form.
- **'Assess Eligibility (AE)'**: After receiving the application and handling missing information, the eligibility is assessed.
- **Sequential Steps**:
  - If `Request Missing Info` happens, validate the form again after assessment (`Validate Form (VA1)`).
  - If no missing info was requested or the validation step passed, proceed directly with the subsequent sequential steps involving further validations and the final approval decision.
- **Final Workflow**: Upon successful completion of all the activities, send a confirmation and archive the case.

This structure allows for flexibility in handling scenarios where additional `Request Missing Info` operations may occur.
