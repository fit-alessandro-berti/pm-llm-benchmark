To solve this problem, we need to model a complex digital service provisioning process using a Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL). The POWL model will represent the process as a graph with partial orders, loops, and exclusive choices, capturing the dependencies between tasks and their concurrent execution where applicable.

### Approach
1. **Define Transitions**: Create labeled transitions for each activity in the process (e.g., SR, CS, DA, ACI, BNC, D&R, CD, MD, QA, SA, GLA).
2. **Model the Loop**: Use a LOOP operator to represent the repeated execution of BNC followed by optional D&R until the configuration is stable.
3. **Model the Exclusive Choice**: Use an XOR operator to represent the choice between Containerized Deployment (CD) and Monolithic Deployment (MD).
4. **Construct Partial Orders**: Use StrictPartialOrder to define:
   - Sequential dependencies (e.g., SR  CS).
   - Concurrent tasks (e.g., DA and ACI running in parallel).
   - Final tasks (QA and SA running concurrently before GLA).
5. **Combine Components**: Integrate all components into a single POWL model using StrictPartialOrder, ensuring all dependencies are correctly represented via edges in the partial order.

### Solution Code
```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities as transitions
SR = Transition(label="SR")
CS = Transition(label="CS")
DA = Transition(label="DA")
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")
D_R = Transition(label="D&R")
CD = Transition(label="CD")
MD = Transition(label="MD")
QA = Transition(label="QA")
SA = Transition(label="SA")
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")

# Define the loop: BNC followed by optional D&R
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# Define the exclusive choice: CD or MD
choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Construct the entire process as a partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop, choice, QA, SA, GLA])

# Add edges to define dependencies:
# 1. SR must be completed before CS
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# 2. CS must be completed before DA and ACI (concurrent)
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# 3. Both DA and ACI must be completed before the loop
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)

# 4. The loop must be completed before the deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(loop, choice)

# 5. The deployment choice must be completed before QA and SA (concurrent)
root.order.add_edge(choice, QA)
root.order.add_edge(choice, SA)

# 6. Both QA and SA must be completed before GLA
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)
```

### Explanation
1. **Transitions**: Each activity (e.g., SR, CS) is defined as a `Transition` object with a corresponding label.
2. **Loop Operator**: The LOOP operator (`OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.LOOP`) models the repeated execution of BNC followed by optional D&R. This loop continues until the configuration is stable (handled implicitly by the loop operator).
3. **Exclusive Choice**: The XOR operator (`OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR`) represents the choice between CD and MD, where only one is executed.
4. **Partial Order Construction**:
   - **Sequential Dependencies**: Edges enforce sequential execution (e.g., SR  CS).
   - **Concurrent Execution**: Absence of edges between tasks like DA and ACI allows them to run in parallel.
   - **Final Tasks**: QA and SA run concurrently and both must complete before GLA, enforced by edges from QA and SA to GLA.
5. **Integration**: All components are combined into a single `StrictPartialOrder` object, with edges defining the workflow dependencies, ensuring the process adheres to the specified requirements. This model efficiently captures the complex dependencies and concurrency inherent in the telecom service provisioning process.
