Based on the provided data, there are two main anomalies:

1. In the first step (Declaring a Payment), 4 errors were identified: Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, and Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR.

2. There is an issue with direct follow-follow, where Directly-Follows Constraints (Directly-Follows Constraints) was incorrectly applied:

   ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER')  

It seems there was a typo in the directive "Declaration SAVED" which should be "Declaration APPROVED".

So to summarize, anomalies found include:
- The Directly-Follows Constraints were wrongly applied: (Directly-Follows Constraints) ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER'), (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER') ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), and (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR)'('Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'). 
- There are duplicate declarations: Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE, and Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER.
