Alright, I need to solve this problem using DuckDB SQL. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the goal is to find the top K process variants based on their frequency and then return all events from these top variants.

1. **Extract Activity Sequences**: For each case_id, I need to get the ordered sequence of activities. I can do this by grouping by case_id and then aggregating the activities in the order of their timestamps. Using the array_agg function with an order by clause should work here.

2. **Count Variants**: Once I have the sequences, I need to count how many cases have each unique sequence. I'll group by the sequence and count the number of case_ids.

3. **Identify Top K Variants**: After counting, I'll sort the variants by their frequency in descending order and pick the top K. Assigning a row number using the row_number() function will help identify these top variants.

4. **Filter Cases**: Now, I need to filter the original event_log to include only those cases whose activity sequence is among the top K. This involves joining the event_log with the top variants subquery.

5. **Return Events**: Finally, select all events from these filtered cases.

I should also make sure to handle the K value correctly, possibly using a parameter or a placeholder. Additionally, ensuring that the sequences are correctly compared and that the filtering is efficient is crucial.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the query with CTEs to make each step clear and manageable.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze an event log stored in a DuckDB table to identify the top K process variants based on their frequency. Each variant is defined by the sequence of activities executed in a specific order within a case. The solution involves extracting these sequences, counting their occurrences, and then retrieving the events corresponding to the most frequent variants.

### Approach

1. **Extract Activity Sequences**: For each `case_id`, we need to determine the ordered sequence of activities. This is achieved by sorting the events within each case by their `timestamp` and then aggregating the activities into a sequence.

2. **Count Variants**: Once we have the sequences, we count how many times each unique sequence (variant) occurs across all cases.

3. **Identify Top K Variants**: We then determine which sequences are the top K most frequent by sorting the variants by their count in descending order.

4. **Filter Cases**: Using the identified top K variants, we filter the original event log to include only the events from cases that belong to these top variants.

5. **Return Events**: Finally, we retrieve all the events from the filtered cases.

### Solution Code

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence, 
        COUNT(case_id) AS count
    FROM 
        case_sequences
    GROUP BY 
        activity_sequence
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM 
        variant_counts
    ORDER BY 
        count DESC
    LIMIT 
        K
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
JOIN 
    case_sequences cs 
    ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
JOIN 
    top_variants tv 
    ON cs.activity_sequence = tv.activity_sequence;
```

### Explanation

1. **Extract Activity Sequences**:
   - The `case_sequences` CTE (Common Table Expression) groups the event log by `case_id` and aggregates the activities into an ordered sequence using `array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`.

2. **Count Variants**:
   - The `variant_counts` CTE counts how many times each unique `activity_sequence` occurs across all cases.

3. **Identify Top K Variants**:
   - The `top_variants` CTE selects the top K sequences by sorting the counts in descending order and limiting the result to K rows.

4. **Filter Cases**:
   - The main query joins the original event log with the `case_sequences` and `top_variants` CTEs to filter out only the events from cases that belong to the top K variants.

This approach efficiently breaks down the problem into manageable steps, ensuring clarity and maintainability. Each CTE serves a specific purpose, making the query easy to understand and modify if needed.
