Below is one example of a Python dictionary representing an estimated temporal profile for the global supply chain process. In this example, each key is a tuple of two activity labels (indicating that the second activity eventually follows the first in at least one execution), and each value is a tuple containing an estimated average elapsed time (in seconds) and a standard deviation (also in seconds) for that elapsed time. Note that many of the estimates come from summing delays along the process flow (with reasonable “buffer” uncertainty added), and some pairs represent non‐adjacent activities.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct or nearly consecutive activity pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (10800, 1800),      # e.g., Supplier Selection to Order Placement (~3 hrs ± 0.5 hr)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (86400, 14400),     # Order Placement to Receive Components (~24 hrs ± 4 hrs)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 1800),       # Receive Components to Quality Inspection (~2 hrs ± 0.5 hr)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 3600),      # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly (~4 hrs ± 1 hr)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 3600),      # Component Assembly to Product Testing (~6 hrs ± 1 hr)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 1800),       # Product Testing to Packaging (~2 hrs ± 0.5 hr)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 600),        # Packaging to Warehouse Storage (~1 hr ± 10 min)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 14400),     # Warehouse Storage to Distribution (~24 hrs ± 4 hrs)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (259200, 43200),    # Distribution to After-Sales Support (~72 hrs ± 12 hrs)

    # Multi-step (non-adjacent) activity pairs
    ('SS', 'RC'): (97200, 15000),     # SS -> OP -> RC (~3 hrs + 24 hrs)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (104400, 16000),    # SS -> OP -> RC -> QI (~3 + 24 + 2 hrs)
    ('SS', 'CA'): (118800, 17000),    # SS -> OP -> RC -> QI -> CA (~3 + 24 + 2 + 4 hrs)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (129600, 18000),    # OP -> RC -> QI -> CA -> PT (~24 + 2 + 4 + 6 hrs)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (133200, 16000),    # QI -> CA -> PT -> PK -> WS -> DT (~4 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 24 hrs)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (237600, 30000)     # SS through to DT: the sum of all intermediate delays (~66 hrs total)
}
```

### Explanation

- **Direct pairs:** The first nine entries capture delays between activities that are directly or nearly directly connected in the process.
- **Multi-step pairs:** The remaining entries combine the delays of several sequential steps. For example, the delay from **SS** (Supplier Selection) to **RC** (Receive Components) sums the delay from **SS** to **OP** and then **OP** to **RC**.

These estimates are illustrative and designed to reflect both the order of operations and the inherent variability in a complex global supply chain process.
