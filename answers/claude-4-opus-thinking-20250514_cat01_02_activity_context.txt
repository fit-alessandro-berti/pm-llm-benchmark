## Analysis of Recurring Activities

I've identified three activities that appear multiple times with different contextual meanings:

1. **Verify Documents** - appears twice in cases C001 and C003
2. **Call Customer** - appears twice in case C002, once in C001 and C003
3. **Adjust Account** - appears in C002 and C003 with different purposes

## Justification for Naming Choices

### 1. Verify Documents
- **"Verify Documents - Initial Check"**: The first verification in all cases, establishing baseline verification
- **"Verify Documents - Supplementary Review"** (C001): Occurs after customer submits additional documentation, indicating a re-verification with new materials
- **"Verify Documents - Post-Adjustment Review"** (C003): Occurs after account adjustments, ensuring documentation still aligns with updated account information

### 2. Call Customer
Each call has a distinct purpose:
- **"Call Customer - Request Missing Documents"** (C001): Reactive call due to incomplete verification
- **"Call Customer - Clarify Discrepancy"** (C002): Investigative call to understand account issues
- **"Call Customer - Confirm Changes"** (C002): Follow-up call to ensure customer awareness of adjustments
- **"Call Customer - Request Return"** (C003): Operational call for in-branch customer management

### 3. Adjust Account
- **"Adjust Account - Discrepancy Resolution"** (C002): Adjustment made after customer clarification
- **"Adjust Account - Data Correction"** (C003): Internal correction due to missing information

These renamed activities now clearly distinguish between:
- Initial vs. subsequent actions
- Different purposes for the same type of action
- The trigger or context that necessitated the action

This disambiguation helps in process analysis, as it's now clear that "Verify Documents" in different positions serves different quality control purposes, and "Call Customer" represents different communication strategies depending on the process state.
