Based on the provided data, the process appears to be a workflow for managing a declaration, which is likely a financial or accounting related process. Here is a detailed description of the process:

**Process Overview**

The process starts with an `Employee` submitting a `Declaration`, which is either `SUBMITTED` or `REJECTED` by another `Employee` or `Administrator`. If the `Declaration` is `SUBMITTED`, it can either be approved by several roles `ADMINISTRATION`, `SUPERVISOR`, `BUDGET OWNER`, or `PRE_APPROVER` before being finalized.

**Approval Chain**

The approval chain is as follows:

1. `SUBMITTED` by `EMPLOYEE` -> approved by `ADMINISTRATION` or `REJECTED` by `ADMINISTRATION` or `SUPERVISOR` or `BUDGET OWNER`
2. If approved by `ADMINISTRATION`, it can be:
	* approved by `SUPERVISOR` (main approval chain)
	* approved by `BUDGET OWNER` (alternative approval chain)
	* or rejected by `SUPERVISOR` (fork in the process)
3. If rejected by `ADMINISTRATION`, it can be:
	* rejected by `EMPLOYEE` (loop back to submission)
	* rejected by `SUPERVISOR` (fork in the process)
	* or it can go to `PRE_APPROVER` for approval (alternative approval chain)
4. `PRE_APPROVER`'s approval can be followed by:
	* `SUPERVISOR` approval (main approval chain)
	* or `REJECTED` by `SUPERVISOR` (fork in the process)

**Branches and Loops**

There are several branches and loops in the process, indicating alternative approval paths or rejection scenarios. For example:

* If a `Declaration` is rejected, it can be looped back to the submission stage.
* If a `Declaration` is approved by `SUPERVISOR`, it can then be approved by `BUDGET OWNER` (alternative approval chain).
* If a `Declaration` is rejected by `SUPERVISOR`, it can be looped back to the submission stage.

**End States**

The process has several end states:

* `FINAL_APPROVED` by `SUPERVISOR`: indicates that the process is complete and the declaration is approved.
* `Payment Handled`: indicates that the payment for the declaration has been processed.
* `REJECTED` by `MISSING`: indicates an exception when the approval step is missing (
