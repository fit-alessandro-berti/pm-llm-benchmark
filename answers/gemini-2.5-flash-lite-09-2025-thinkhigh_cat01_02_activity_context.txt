This analysis requires identifying which activities change meaning based on their position or the preceding events within a single support case.

## 1. Identification of Recurring Activities and Contextual Shifts

Two primary activities recur within individual cases, exhibiting different functional meanings:

1.  **`Verify Documents`**: This activity appears first as the standard initial check. Subsequent appearances occur after the process stalls (e.g., missing documents are uploaded, or an internal adjustment requires checking again).
2.  **`Call Customer`**: This activity appears in different contexts: sometimes to request missing information or clarify discrepancies, and sometimes specifically to confirm that a preceding internal adjustment has been successfully completed.

## 2. Renaming Strategy

Based on the contextual clues provided in the "Additional Context" column:

| Original Activity | Contextual Role / Clue | Proposed New Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Verify Documents** (First instance in case) | Standard, initial validation check. | **Initial Document Verification** |
| **Verify Documents** (Subsequent instance in case) | Re-check performed *after* new data was provided or a correction was made. | **Review Document Set** |
| **Call Customer** (Requesting docs, clarifying issues) | Proactive outreach to gather necessary input or resolve early discrepancies. | **Outbound Action Call** |
| **Call Customer** (Confirming prior system change) | Follow-up call strictly confirming a preceding internal adjustment. | **Confirmation Call** |

## 4. Justification of Naming Choices

### For `Verify Documents`

*   **Initial Document Verification:** This name clearly denotes the first required compliance step (e.g., C001 @ 09:20).
*   **Review Document Set:** This name highlights that the verification is iterative. In C001, it follows the customer uploading the missing ID, and in C003, it follows an internal adjustment, indicating a necessary re-assessment of the file rather than the initial audit.

### For `Call Customer`

*   **Outbound Action Call:** This applies when the call's purpose is to prompt customer behavior necessary to move the case forward (requesting missing docs in C001, getting the customer to return in C003, or clarifying an initial discrepancy in C002).
*   **Confirmation Call:** This name is reserved for the specific event in C002 where the agent calls *after* performing an internal `Adjust Account` step, signifying the call's purpose is validation, not information seeking.
