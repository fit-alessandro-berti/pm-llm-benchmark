The attributes that could potentially be sensitive for fairness in this context are:

1. `case:citizen`: If this attribute represents citizenship status, it could potentially be a sensitive attribute if there's a discrepancy in the performance or frequency of activities between different citizenship groups.

2. `case:gender`: If this attribute represents gender, it could potentially be a sensitive attribute if there's a discrepancy in the performance or frequency of activities between different genders.

3. `resource`: If this attribute represents the resource (like a loan officer or a system) that the process is being handled by, it could potentially be a sensitive attribute if there's a discrepancy in the performance or frequency of activities between different resources.

It's important to note that just because these attributes are potentially sensitive, it does not mean that they actually are. Fairness in machine learning models depends on whether there's a statistically significant disparity in the treatment of different groups in the data. Therefore, it's crucial to conduct a thorough analysis and interpretation of the data to determine if these attributes actually need to be considered for fairness.
