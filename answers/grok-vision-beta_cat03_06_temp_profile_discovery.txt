To generate a temporal profile for the process variants you've provided, we will calculate the average and standard deviation of the time between each pair of activities. However, the provided data does not include individual timestamps for each activity occurrence, only the total performance time for each process variant. Given this limitation, we will simulate how one might calculate these statistics if we had the detailed timing data for each activity transition.

Here's a step-by-step approach to generate a simplified temporal profile:

1. **Extract Activity Pairs**: Identify all pairs of consecutive activities from the process variants.
2. **Calculate Statistics**: For each pair, calculate the average and standard deviation of the time difference. Since we don't have individual timings, we'll use the total performance time divided by the number of transitions to estimate average times, and we'll simulate standard deviations.

### Step 1: Extracting Activity Pairs

From your process variants, we can extract pairs like:
- (Create Fine, Send Fine)
- (Send Fine, Insert Fine Notification)
- (Insert Fine Notification, Add penalty)
- ...

### Step 2: Calculating Statistics

Given that we only have total performance times and frequencies, we'll simulate the calculation:

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulated function to get average and standard deviation for a pair
def calculate_stats(avg_time, count, zeta=1):
    # Here we simulate some variation in timing for demonstration
    times = np.random.normal(loc=avg_time, scale=avg_time/zeta, size=count)
    return np.mean(times), np.std(times)

# Example data structure
process_variants = {
    ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (8380516.026 / 20385, 20385),
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (59591524.946 / 56482, 56482),
    # Add other pairs similarly...
}

temporal_profile = {}
for pair, (avg_time, count) in process_variants.items():
    avg, std = calculate_stats(avg_time, count)
    temporal_profile[pair] = (avg, std)

print(temporal_profile)
```

### Explanation:

- **avg_time**: This is the average time for a pair, calculated as total performance time divided by the number of occurrences of this transition.
- **count**: This is how many times this transition occurs across all process instances.
- **calculate_stats**: This function simulates the generation of times with some randomness (using normal distribution) to estimate both average and standard deviation. Here, `zeta` is used to adjust the scale of the standard deviation for simulation purposes.

### Limitations:

- This approach assumes uniform distribution of time across different instances of the same activity pair, which might not be realistic.
- Without actual detailed timing data, the standard deviation is purely simulated.
- We only consider direct successors here. For full temporal profiling considering all possible pairs (not just direct successors), you would need to expand this logic.

### Conclusion:

This example provides a framework for how you might structure the calculation of a temporal profile with the data you have. For a real-world application, you would need actual timing data for each activity instance to compute accurate statistics.
