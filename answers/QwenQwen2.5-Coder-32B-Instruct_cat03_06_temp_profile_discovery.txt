Generating a temporal profile for the given process involves calculating the average and standard deviation of the times between all possible successor activity pairs across all process variants. Given the provided data, it appears that the `performance` value for each variant represents the total time taken for the entire process variant.

However, to calculate the average and standard deviation of time differences between activity pairs, we would need the actual individual times for each activity transition in the process variants. If we assume that the `performance` value is evenly distributed among the activities in the variant, we can approximate the time differences. This is a simplification and might not be accurate.

Let's assume an even distribution of the `performance` value among the activities in each variant and calculate the average and standard deviation of time differences between activity pairs.

First, let's extract all the activity pairs from the process variants, then calculate the time differences, and finally compute the average and standard deviation for each unique pair.

Here's how you can do it in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

# Define the process variants and their performance
variants = [

# Extract all activity pairs and their performance values
activity_pairs = defaultdict(list)

for variant, performance, frequency in variants:
    activities = variant.split(" -> ")
    num_activities = len(activities)
    
    # Assume the performance is evenly distributed among the activities
    uniform_time = performance / (num_activities - 1)  # number of transitions
    
    for i in range(num_activities - 1):
        pair = (activities[i], activities[i + 1])
        activity_pairs[pair].extend([uniform_time] * frequency)

# Calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair
temporal_profile = {}
for pair, times in activity_pairs.items():
    avg_time = np.mean(times)
    stdev_time = np.std(times)
    temporal_profile[pair] = (avg_time, stdev_time)

# Display the temporal profile
for pair, (avg, stdev) in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"{pair}: (avg={avg:.2f}, stdev={stdev:.2f})")
```

This code will generate a temporal profile where each activity pair is associated with the average and standard deviation of the time differences calculated based on the assumption of an even distribution of the `performance` value among the activities in each variant.

Note: This is a simplification and the actual times might differ due to varying time distribution across activities. For a more accurate temporal profile, you would need the individual times for each activity transition.
