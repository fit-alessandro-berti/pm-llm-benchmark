The picture is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram that maps how an order is taken, produced and shipped inside a company.  
It is drawn as a classic “swimlane” process: each horizontal band represents one organisational unit and shows the activities that unit performs.

LANES (from top to bottom)

1. Sales  
2. Production  
3. Procurement  
4. Warehouse  

MAIN FLOW

Sales lane  
• Start (clock symbol) “Monday morning”.  
• “Check order for completeness”.  
• Exclusive gateway  if the order is complete:  
– “Check if customer is already in the database”.  
– If the customer is unknown, task “Add customer to the database”; both branches merge.  
• “Send order details” (a task that creates a data object ‘Order details’ and fires a message to the other lanes).  
• Intermediate message catch event “Product sent” (Sales waits for confirmation that the parcel has left the warehouse).  
• “Draft invoice”  End.

Production lane  
• Message start event “Order details arrive” (triggered by Sales).  
• “Plan production”.  
• Exclusive gateway checks material availability:  
– If enough, continue directly.  
– If material has to be replenished or replaced, it sends a message (dashed flow) to Procurement and waits for the intermediate event “Material not faulty” before it can go on.  
• “Manufacture product”.  
• End event “Product complete” that in turn sends a message to Warehouse.

Procurement lane  
• Message start event “Order details arrive”.  
• Subprocess “Material Compensation”:  
– Start event.  
– “Order materials” (with a timer / escalation boundary event that can lead to “Return material”).  
– End of subprocess.  
• “Check materials” (intermediate event to confirm quality).  
• If material is bad, eventbased gateway leads to an “Order cancellation” end.  
• If material is fine, it throws the intermediate event “Material not faulty” back to Production and the lane ends.

Warehouse lane  
• Message start “Product complete”.  
• “Send product”.  
• End message event “Product sent” (the confirmation caught by Sales).

CONNECTORS  

• Solid arrows = sequence flows inside a lane.  
• Dashed arrows = BPMN message flows between lanes.  
• Diamond shapes = gateways (decision / merge).  
• Thinoutlined circles = start events; thickoutlined circles = end events; envelope icons = message events.

In short, the diagram captures an ordertocash scenario across four departments, showing how order checking, customer registration, material procurement, production, shipping and invoicing interact through both internal flows and crossdepartment messages.
