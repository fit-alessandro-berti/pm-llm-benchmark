The picture is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram that models how a customer order is handled inside a company.  
It is drawn with horizontal swim-lanes that show which department (or “pool”) is responsible for each activity:

1. Sales (top lane)
2. Production
3. Procurement
4. Warehouse (bottom lane)

High-level flow

A. Sales lane  
• A timer start event labelled “Monday morning” kicks the process off.  
• “Check order for completeness.”  
• A data-based XOR gateway asks: “Is the customer already in the database?”  
  – If NO, “Add customer to the database”, then re-joins the main branch.  
• End of this mini-process is a small circle (local end event) that feeds the main flow.  
• “Send order details” (envelope icon) transmits the order to the other lanes via dashed message flows.  
• After the product has been shipped (message returned from Warehouse), Sales creates a “Draft invoice” and the lane ends with a regular end event.

B. Production lane  
• A message start event (“Order details arrive”) waits for the dashed message from Sales.  
• “Plan production.”  
• An XOR gateway checks material status.  
  – If material is NOT faulty, flow proceeds to “Manufacture product.”  
  – If material is faulty, a dashed message is sent to Procurement for a return/cancellation.  
• A circle end event labelled “Product complete” sends a dashed message to the Warehouse lane to trigger shipment.

C. Procurement lane  
• A message start event also listens for the order details.  
• A collapsed subprocess called “Material Compensation Subprocess” begins with “Order materials.”  
  – Inside that subprocess a dashed line shows that faulty materials can be “Return material.”  
• After the subprocess, “Check materials.”  
• A terminate end event can cancel the order if problems persist, otherwise a normal end event closes the lane.

D. Warehouse lane  
• Waits for the “Product complete” message.  
• “Send product” task.  
• A message end event “Product sent” notifies Sales and closes the overall order handling loop.

Key notation elements visible

• Rectangle tasks (plain activities).  
• Collapsed subprocess (double-border rectangle in Procurement).  
• Exclusive gateways (diamond with X).  
• Message flows (dashed arrows) vs. sequence flows (solid arrows).  
• Intermediate events (small circles), start and end events.  
• Timer start event (clock icon).  
• Data store icon labeled “database.”

Overall meaning

1. Sales receives and validates an order, adds new customers if necessary, and broadcasts order details.  
2. Production plans and manufactures after checking material quality.  
3. Procurement secures or replaces materials and can cancel if issues cannot be fixed.  
4. Warehouse ships the finished product and notifies Sales so an invoice can be drafted.

Thus the visualization documents the hand-offs, decision points, and possible exception paths in an end-to-end order-fulfilment process across four departments.
