To infer the case groupings (i.e., which events belong to the same patient journey), we can analyze the sequence of events by looking at the following key attributes:
1. **Patient demographics**: `patient_age` and `patient_gender` (assuming these uniquely identify a patient in this dataset).
2. **Logical sequence of activities**: A patient's journey typically follows a sequence like registration  triage  consultation  tests/treatment  discharge.
3. **Department**: Events for a single patient should generally stay within the same department (e.g., ER, Surgery) unless the patient is transferred.
4. **Timestamps**: Events for a single patient should be close in time and not interleaved with unrelated events.

### Step-by-Step Grouping:
Let’s go through the events and group them by patient:

#### Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER)
- Event 1: Register patient (ER, age=45, M)
- Event 4: Initial triage (ER, age=45, M)  follows registration
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology, but age=45, M matches)  likely same patient
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER, age=45, M)  diagnosis after X-ray
- Event 15: Patient discharged (ER, age=45, M)  completion of ER case

#### Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER)
- Event 2: Register patient (ER, age=62, F)
- Event 5: Initial triage (ER, age=62, F)  follows registration
- Event 8: Lab test requested (ER, age=62, F)  after triage
- Event 10: Lab test completed (Lab, age=62, F)  result of test
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER, age=62, F)  diagnosis
- Event 14: Prescription created (ER, age=62, F)  prescription after diagnosis
- Event 17: Patient discharged (ER, age=62, F)  completion

#### Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Surgery)
- Event 3: Register patient (Surgery, age=28, M)  different department (Surgery)
- Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery, age=28, M)  consultation before surgery
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery, age=28, M)  prep for surgery
- Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery, age=28, M)  actual surgery
- Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery, age=28, M)  post-surgery
- Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery, age=28, M)  completion

### Verification:
- No overlapping demographics or conflicting sequences (e.g., a patient cannot be in ER and Surgery simultaneously unless transferred, which doesn’t happen here).
- The sequences are logical:
  - For the 45-year-old male: ER registration  triage  X-ray  diagnosis  discharge.
  - For the 62-year-old female: ER registration  triage  lab test  diagnosis  prescription  discharge.
  - For the 28-year-old male: Surgery registration  consultation  prep  surgery  recovery  discharge.

### Final Case Groupings:
1. **Case 1**: Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 (45-year-old male, ER)
2. **Case 2**: Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 (62-year-old female, ER)
3. **Case 3**: Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 (28-year-old male, Surgery)

The events are grouped into 3 distinct cases:

### Key Observations:
1. **Demographics as identifiers**: `patient_age` and `patient_gender` uniquely identify each case in this dataset. No two patients share both age and gender.
2. **Department consistency**: Each case stays within its department (ER or Surgery), except for the 45-year-old male’s X-ray, which is in Radiology but is part of the ER workflow.
3. **Logical progression**: Each case follows a reasonable sequence of healthcare activities (e.g., registration  triage  tests  treatment  discharge).

Thus, there are **3 distinct cases** in this dataset.
