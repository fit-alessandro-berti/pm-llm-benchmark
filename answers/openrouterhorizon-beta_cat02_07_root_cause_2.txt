Here’s a concise performance analysis of the event log with root-cause insights and mitigation ideas.

1) Cases with significantly longer durations (Submit Claim to Close Claim)
- Case 2001 (A, Low): 1h30m — fast
- Case 2004 (B, Low): 1h25m — fast
- Case 2002 (B, Medium): ~25h55m — delayed
- Case 2003 (A, High): ~48h20m — significantly delayed
- Case 2005 (B, High): ~77h05m — very delayed

Long-running cases: 2002, 2003, 2005 (especially 2005).

2) Attribute patterns and likely root causes
a) Complexity
- High complexity cases (2003, 2005) have multiple “Request Additional Documents” events and the longest lead times.
- Low complexity cases (2001, 2004) complete within ~1.5 hours with no document requests.
- Medium complexity (2002) has a single document request and is delayed by about a day.
Conclusion: Higher complexity strongly correlates with more document cycles and longer throughput.

b) Requests for Additional Documents
- 0 requests: 2001, 2004 — fastest.
- 1 request: 2002 — moderate delay.
- 2 requests: 2003 — large delay.
- 3 requests: 2005 — very large delay.
Conclusion: Each additional document request adds at least one business day of waiting, likely due to customer response and internal review cycles.

c) Region
- Region A: one fast low-complexity case (2001) and one long high-complexity case (2003).
- Region B: one fast low-complexity case (2004), one medium case with a day of delay (2002), and one very long high-complexity case (2005).
Conclusion: Region by itself is not the dominant factor; its impact appears mediated by complexity and rework (document requests). However, Region B has the two slower cases at Medium/High, which may suggest capacity or policy differences in handling non-low complexity.

d) Resources
- Adjusters:
  - Adjuster_Mike (A): High (2003) had 2 document requests; Low (2001) was fast.
  - Adjuster_Lisa (B): Medium (2002) had 1 request; High (2005) had 3 requests.
- Managers:
  - Manager_Ann: Approvals are quick once reached (minutes to <1h).
  - Manager_Bill: Appears on high-complexity cases (2003, 2005). Approval itself is punctual relative to the prior event; delays are mostly upstream (document cycles).
- Finance:
  - Payments across Alan/Carl are prompt (<1h after approval).
Conclusion: The primary delay driver is at the adjuster phase, tied to repeated document requests. No clear evidence that individual adjusters are slower independent of complexity; rather, higher complexity cases cause more back-and-forth.

3) Explanations and mitigation suggestions
Why these attributes contribute to delays
- Complexity: High-complexity claims need more evidence and validations, resulting in multiple document request loops and longer customer response times.
- Document request cycles: Each iteration introduces waiting time (customer turnaround, internal review queues), compounding delays.
- Region/capacity: Region B handles the medium/high cases that show more iterations; may indicate heavier workload, stricter compliance checks, or less automation/templates for complex claims.
- Adjuster workload/process: Adjusters on complex claims may request documents incrementally rather than comprehensively, causing multiple loops.

Mitigations
1) Reduce document request iterations
   - Introduce a comprehensive evidence checklist for Medium/High complexity at first touch to minimize subsequent requests.
   - Enable guided intake with dynamic questionnaires to capture more complete data upfront.
   - Add SLA and coaching for “first-pass completeness” for adjusters.

2) Triage and specialization
   - Route High-complexity cases to a specialist team trained to assemble an upfront, holistic document package.
   - Implement priority queues or case ownership continuity to prevent idle time between document submissions and reviews.

3) Customer response acceleration
   - Offer digital upload portals, mobile reminders, and clear instructions; auto-reminders after 24–48 hours.
   - Provide a single consolidated request message rather than multiple piecemeal requests.

4) Regional process alignment
   - Review Region B’s procedures for complex cases; harmonize checklists and approval criteria with Region A if differences exist.
   - Balance workload across regions for complex claims to avoid bottlenecks.

5) Monitoring and controls
   - Track KPI: “number of document request loops per case” and set thresholds (e.g., alert after 2 loops).
   - Add WIP limits and escalation triggers for cases idle >24h after a document submission.

Summary
- Long cases: 2002 (Medium), 2003 (High), 2005 (High—worst).
- Root cause pattern: Higher complexity  more document requests  longer lead time; region B may experience added delays on non-low complexity. Manager/Finance steps are not bottlenecks.
- Focus improvements on reducing document request iterations, better upfront data capture, specialized handling for complex cases, and customer response acceleration.
