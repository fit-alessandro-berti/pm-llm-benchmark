## Advanced Scheduling Strategies for Precision Parts Inc. Using Process Mining

### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

**Process Mining Techniques:**
- **Discovery:** Use process discovery algorithms (e.g., alpha algorithm, heuristics miner) on the MES event logs to reconstruct the actual control flow of jobs through different machines. This will uncover the true sequence of tasks executed.
- **Conformance Checking:** Employ conformance checking techniques (e.g., fitness, alignment, and distance-based methods) to compare the actual process flow with a predefined ideal or target process model. Metrics such as deviation scores can quantify how well (or poorly) the current scheduling adheres to intended operational patterns.

**Metrics for Analysis:**

* **Job Flow Times & Lead Times:** Calculate averages, medians, and distributions of times taken from job release to completion and between key task transitions. Use cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) to model lead time distributions.
* **Queue Times (Waiting Times):** Analyze waiting durations at each machine, segmented by task type and priority level. This involves calculating average and maximum queue times per machine/task.
* **Resource Utilization:**
  - Productive Time: Calculate the ratio of time machines spend actively processing tasks to their total operational time.
  - Idle Time: Measure periods when machines are inactive (due to waiting for setup, material, or other jobs).
  - Setup Time: Categorize setup durations as planned vs. actual and segment them by sequence-dependency. Use statistical analysis to understand variations.
* **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** Utilize the `Notes` field in the event log to manually categorize jobs based on whether a setup is sequence-dependent, then analyze the duration of such setups against other job sequences.
* **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness:** Measure the percentage of jobs completed on time and the frequency/duration of delays using metrics like tardiness (delay beyond due date) and late completion percentages.
* **Impact of Disruptions:** Segment performance metrics by presence or absence of disruption events (breakdowns, urgent changes). Analyze how these affect schedule adherence and KPIs (e.g., increased setup times post-breakdown).

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

**Key Pathologies Identified via Process Mining:**

* **Bottlenecks:** Identify machines with consistently high utilization or long queue lengths using resource utilization metrics, leading to extended lead times and increased WIP.
* **Poor Prioritization:** Analyze job priority distribution in relation to actual completion times. Look for patterns where high-priority jobs are delayed due to suboptimal scheduling decisions.
* **Inefficient Sequencing:** Use sequence analysis techniques (e.g., comparing setup durations across different sequences) to identify instances where task sequencing significantly increases overall processing time.
* **Resource Starvation:** Detect periods of downstream resource starvation by correlating machine load with upstream job release times and queue lengths at subsequent machines.
* **Bullwhip Effect in WIP:** Analyze fluctuations in WIP across different stages of the process to identify amplification effects caused by scheduling variability or unclear priorities.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

**Potential Root Causes & Process Mining Insights:**

* **Static Dispatch Rules Limitations:** Process mining will show deviations from intended flow, indicating rule inflexibility in dynamic environments (e.g., unexpected job complexity or priority changes).
* **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Identify instances where sudden disruptions cause significant delays by examining the timing and impact of unplanned events.
* **Inaccurate Duration Estimates:** Analyze task duration distributions to reveal overestimation or underestimation biases, affecting both scheduling realism and resource allocation.
* **Sequence-Dependent Setup Mismanagement:** Process mining helps pinpoint specific jobs causing bottlenecks due to sequence-dependent setup durations that deviate from baseline.
* **Poor Coordination Between Centers:** Identify misalignments or gaps in task transitions between work centers using conformance checking, indicating inadequate communication or coordination.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

**Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules**
- **Core Logic:** Implement a dynamic dispatch rule that considers remaining processing time, due date urgency, priority level, downstream resource availability (load and type), and *estimated sequence-dependent setup times* based on historical data.
- **Process Mining Insights:** Use CDFs of task durations and machine utilization patterns to inform the weighting factors for each consideration in dispatch decisions, ensuring realistic scheduling.

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling**
- **Core Logic:** Leverage historical task duration distributions (derived from process mining) and incorporate predictive maintenance data (if available or derivable) to forecast potential bottlenecks and adjust schedules proactively.
- **Process Mining Insights:** Use machine learning models on historical event logs to predict task durations, setup times, and identify patterns indicative of impending machine failures or increased downtime.

**Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization**
- **Core Logic:** Implement intelligent batching of similar jobs (based on material, complexity) at bottleneck machines and optimize job sequencing to minimize cumulative setup time using historical data insights on sequence effects.
- **Process Mining Insights:** Use segmented CDFs for setup durations across different sequences to inform batch sizes and optimal sequencing patterns.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

**Simulation Using Discrete Event Simulation (DES):**

* **Model Construction:** Build a detailed DES model incorporating:
  - Task duration distributions derived from process mining.
  - Machine capacity and breakdown probabilities.
  - Sequence-dependent setup time models based on historical data.
* **Scenario Testing:**
  - High Load: Simulate periods of intense demand to test resource constraints and bottleneck impacts.
  - Frequent Disruptions: Model various disruption patterns (breakdowns, urgent changes) to assess schedule resilience.

**Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation Framework:**

* **KPI Tracking:** Continuously monitor tardiness rates, WIP levels, lead times, and machine utilization using real-time data feeds from the MES system.
* **Drift Detection:** Use statistical process control (SPC) techniques to detect shifts in task duration or setup time distributions over time.
* **Adaptive Scheduling Logic:** Implement feedback loops where deviations from established KPIs trigger automated adjustments to scheduling parameters based on current real-time conditions and historical patterns identified through ongoing process mining.

This approach ensures that Precision Parts Inc. not only addresses immediate scheduling challenges but also establishes a framework for continuous improvement, leveraging the power of data-driven decision making informed by rigorous process analysis.
