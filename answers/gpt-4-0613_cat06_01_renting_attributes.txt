The attributes that could potentially be considered sensitive for fairness in this context are:

1. case:citizen: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a citizen or not. Decision-making based on this attribute can lead to discrimination against non-citizens.

2. case:gender: This attribute presents a binary representation of gender. Discrepancies in decision-making between different values of this attribute can lead to gender discrimination.

3. case:german speaking: This attribute indicates if the person speaks German. Discrimination may arise if decisions are made based on language capabilities.

4. case:married: This attribute indicates the marital status of the individual. Discrimination may occur if there is differential treatment based on marital status.

Please note that the identification of these attributes as sensitive is contingent upon societal and legal norms, and it might not universally be seen as discriminatory to utilize them in certain decision-making contexts.
