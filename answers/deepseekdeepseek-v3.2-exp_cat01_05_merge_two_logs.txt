## Analysis and Matching Strategy

Let me analyze the event logs and establish a matching strategy:

**Timestamp Tolerance:** I'll use a 2-second tolerance window for matching events.

**Event Name Mapping:**
- `Order Received`  `OrderReceived`
- `Order Validated`  `OrderValidation` 
- `Payment Processed`  `PaymentCheck`
- `Item Shipped`  `Shipping`
- `Item Delivered` has no match in Log B
- `Quality Check` exists only in Log B

## Event-by-Event Matching

### 1. Order Received Event
- **Log A:** `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z, Order Received, Order#1234`
- **Log B:** `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, OrderReceived, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"`
- **Time Difference:** 2 seconds (within tolerance)
- **Match Confidence:** High - same order_id and very close timestamps
- **Decision:** MERGE

### 2. Order Validated Event
- **Log A:** `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z, Order Validated, Order#1234`
- **Log B:** `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, OrderValidation, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"`
- **Time Difference:** 1 second (within tolerance)
- **Match Confidence:** High - same order_id and very close timestamps
- **Decision:** MERGE

### 3. Payment Processed Event
- **Log A:** `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234`
- **Log B:** `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z, PaymentCheck, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"`
- **Time Difference:** 5 seconds (outside 2-second tolerance)
- **Match Confidence:** Medium - same order_id but timestamp difference exceeds tolerance
- **Decision:** MERGE with timestamp conflict noted

### 4. Quality Check Event (Log B only)
- **Log B:** `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection"`
- **No matching event in Log A**
- **Decision:** INCLUDE AS SEPARATE EVENT

### 5. Item Shipped Event
- **Log A:** `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234`
- **Log B:** `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z, Shipping, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"`
- **Time Difference:** 2 seconds (within tolerance)
- **Match Confidence:** High - same order_id and very close timestamps
- **Decision:** MERGE

### 6. Item Delivered Event (Log A only)
- **Log A:** `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234`
- **No matching event in Log B**
- **Decision:** INCLUDE AS SEPARATE EVENT

## Key Decisions and Reasoning

1. **Timestamp Selection:** For merged events, I used the earlier timestamp as primary since System A timestamps may reflect when events were "received" rather than when they "started."

2. **Event Name Standardization:** Used Log A's event naming convention as the primary standard since it's considered the "primary" timeline.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** 
   - For the payment event with 5-second difference, I included both timestamps and noted the conflict, using Log A's timestamp as primary.
   - All other merged events had timestamp differences 2 seconds.

4. **Attribute Integration:** Combined all attributes from both logs, preserving the richer metadata from Log B while maintaining the core event structure from Log A.

5. **Missing Events:** Included both the "Quality Check" (Log B only) and "Item Delivered" (Log A only) events with clear source attribution.

The final merged log provides a comprehensive view of the order fulfillment process with enriched attributes while maintaining chronological order and clear provenance for each event.
