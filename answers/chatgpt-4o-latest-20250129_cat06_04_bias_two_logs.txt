The event logs for Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibit a clear pattern of bias, particularly in how scores are adjusted and how final decisions are made. Below is an analysis of how this bias manifests.

---

### **1. Score Adjustment Bias (Community Boost)**
- **Group B (Unprotected Group)** receives score adjustments based on **CommunityGroup membership** (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club").
- The **Community Boost** provides a **+10 point adjustment** to preliminary scores for applicants affiliated with this group.
- **Group A (Protected Group)** does not receive any such adjustments, despite having similar or even higher preliminary scores.

#### **Impact:**
- This directly **advantages** certain applicants in Group B who belong to a recognized CommunityGroup.
- It creates **a systematic advantage** that is **not available to Group A**.
- Since final decisions appear to be influenced by score thresholds, this boost **increases the likelihood of approval for Group B members**.

---

### **2. Influence of LocalResident Status**
- All applicants in **Group A (Protected Group) are marked as FALSE (not local residents).**
- In contrast, all applicants in **Group B (Unprotected Group) are marked as TRUE (local residents).**
- The log does not explicitly show whether LocalResident status directly impacts scoring, but its **correlation with CommunityGroup benefits suggests a structural bias** in favor of local residents.

#### **Impact:**
- If being a **LocalResident** is tied to receiving a **Community Boost**, then **non-local applicants (Group A) are systematically disadvantaged**.
- This could indicate a **geographical or residency-based preference**, which could disproportionately affect certain protected groups.

### **3. Final Decision Discrepancy**
| Group | Case | Preliminary Score | Adjusted Score | Final Decision |
|--------|------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Group A** | P001 | 720 | 720 | **Approved** |
| **Group A** | P002 | 710 | 710 | **Rejected** |
| **Group A** | P003 | 740 | 740 | **Approved** |
| **Group B** | U001 | 720 | 730 | **Approved** |
| **Group B** | U002 | 710 | 710 | **Rejected** |
| **Group B** | U003 | 695 | 705 | **Approved** |

- Without adjustments, **U003 (Group B) would have had the lowest score (695) and likely been rejected.**
- However, due to the **Community Boost**, U003's adjusted score reached **705**, leading to an **Approved** decision.
- Meanwhile, **P002 from Group A, with a score of 710, was rejected, even though it was higher than U003â€™s adjusted score**.

#### **Impact:**
- **Group B applicants who receive a Community Boost are more likely to be approved, even if their original scores are lower.**
- This **systematically disadvantages** Group A applicants, who never receive score adjustments.

### **Conclusion: Evidence of Bias**
- The **Community Boost** creates **an unfair advantage** for some applicants in Group B.
- Local residency status is correlated with **receiving additional scoring benefits**, indirectly disadvantaging Group A.
- **Group A applicants, despite having equal or higher preliminary scores, are less likely to receive favorable final decisions.**
- The **policy of score adjustments based on CommunityGroup membership** introduces bias that favors **local residents and community members**, disproportionately impacting Group A.

This log suggests **systematic bias** in favor of Group B, particularly for those belonging to recognized community groups, while **denying equivalent adjustments to Group A**. This results in **unequal treatment** and potential discrimination against Group A applicants.
