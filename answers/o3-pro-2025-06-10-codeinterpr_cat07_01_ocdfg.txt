The picture is a process-flow map that shows how five different business object types move through, and interact within, one combined workflow. Reading it from the top down you can see:

1. Object types and volumes  
   • VendorInvoiceItem – 1.2 M objects (green)  
   • ReturnOrderItem – 0.8 M objects (red)  
   • PurchaseRequisitionItem – 2.0 M objects (purple)  
   • SalesOrderItem – 3.5 M objects (blue)  
   • PurchaseOrderItem – 5.0 M objects (dark blue)

   Each object type begins at its own “Start” event (white ellipse).

2. Core activities  
   The coloured lines coming from the ellipses converge on a set of shared activities that make up a typical procure-to-pay / order-to-cash scenario:  
   • Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  
   • Create Order  Pack Goods  Ship Goods  Confirm Delivery  Close Order  
   • Send Order  
   • Check Stock  
   • Process Return  
   • Approve Payment  Create Invoice  

3. Volumes per activity  
   Inside every activity box is “Overall: X M”, indicating how many total object occurrences went through that step (e.g., Create Order = 8.5 M, Approve Requisition = 5.7 M).

4. Throughput times  
   The small labels attached to each connector (e.g., 300 ms, 650 ms) show the average throughput time between the two connected activities for the flow that owns that colour.

5. Colour coding  
   Each object type has its own colour, used both for the dot in the activity header and for its segment of every connector. This lets you see, for example, that:  
   • VendorInvoiceItems mainly flow through Approve Payment and Create Invoice (green).  
   • ReturnOrderItems drop into Process Return (red).  
   • PurchaseRequisitionItems follow the purple path to Send Order and Check Stock.  
   • SalesOrderItems run through the blue fulfilment chain (Create Order  Pack Goods … Close Order).  

6. End events  
   Each path terminates in an “End” ellipse, so you can quickly see where objects of a particular type leave the process.

Overall, the diagram gives a compact, at-a-glance view of:
• How many objects of each type move through each activity.  
• Which parts of the process they share.  
• The average time it takes to travel from one step to the next—helpful for spotting bottlenecks and dominant flows.
