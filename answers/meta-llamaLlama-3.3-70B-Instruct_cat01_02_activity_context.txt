### Justification

The renaming is based on the context provided by the "Additional Context" column and the sequence of events. For instance, "Verify Documents" is renamed to "Initial Document Verification" and "Re-verification of Documents" to distinguish between the first check and subsequent checks that occur after more information is gathered or corrections are made. "Call Customer" is renamed based on the purpose of the call, as indicated by the context (e.g., requesting missing documents, clarifying discrepancies, confirming adjustments). "Adjust Account" is differentiated based on whether it's correcting discrepancies or addressing missing information. These names aim to capture the nuanced roles of activities within the workflow, enhancing clarity and process understanding.
