The provided visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that details a shipping and logistics process. The diagram is divided into three main lanes: Warehouse, Departure Point / Pickup (Customs and Shipping), and Logistics. Here’s a detailed description of the process:

1. **Warehouse Lane:**
   - The process starts with the "Ship goods" event in the "Department Point / Pickup (Customs and Shipping)" lane.
   - In the Warehouse lane, the goods are packaged.
   - There's a timer event indicating a 48-hour limit for packaging. If this time limit is exceeded, a notification is sent to the customer about the delay.
   - After packaging, the shipment paperwork is filled out.
   - Finally, the package is moved to the pickup area, concluding the Warehouse lane with the "Shipment prepared" event.

2. **Departure Point / Pickup (Customs and Shipping) Lane:**
   - The process begins with clarifying the shipment method.
   - The process checks if special handling is required.
     - If yes, the process moves to check if insurance is necessary by consulting the customer database. Depending on the result, the parcel may be insured.
   - Regardless of special handling, the package label is written.
   - The system then proceeds to obtain 3 offers from logistic companies.
   - A logistics company is selected and the order is placed.
   - Concurrently, the logistics department insures the parcel if required.

3. **Logistics Lane:**
   - The logistics lane is primarily focused on the insurance of the parcel if needed.

Throughout the process, several decision points (indicated by diamond shapes) and parallel processes (indicated by the XOR and AND gateways) are used to determine different paths based on conditions like special handling and insurance requirements. The diagram ensures a structured and systematic approach to managing the shipping and logistics process, from packaging goods to preparing them for shipment.
