This chart is a timebased alluvial (Sankey-style) diagram showing how individual “fines” move through three sequential processing steps over roughly 2000–2013.  

– Along the top you see a horizontal line labeled “Send Fine.”  Every fine that’s issued appears as a thin vertical stroke on this line, with its exact timestamp plotted on the x-axis (from about January 25, 2000, on the far left, through April 24, 2013, on the far right).  
– In the middle is a second horizontal line labeled “Insert Fine Notification,” and along the bottom is “Send for Credit Collection.”  

Between each pair of stages the thin, triangulartapering bands trace each fine’s journey from one event to the next in time.  
• Grey bands represent all fines as they progress from issuance (top) to notification (middle), and then onward (if they proceed) to credit collection (bottom).  
• The same bands are overlaid in red for the subset of fines that actually end up being sent to credit collection—so wherever you see a red stream reaching the bottom line, that is a fine that made it all the way through.  

Because each band converges from a wide base at its source timestamp and narrows to a point at its destination timestamp, you can instantly see both the timing (how long a fine lingers in each stage) and the relative volume (many wide grey bands tapering to only a few red bands tells you that only a small fraction of fines wind up in credit collection).  

In sum, the visualization neatly captures:  
1) the full universe of fines issued over 13 years;  
2) the delay and throughput from issuance to notification;  
3) the even smaller subset that escalates to credit collection;  
and  
4) the precise dates when each batch of fines hit each milestone.
