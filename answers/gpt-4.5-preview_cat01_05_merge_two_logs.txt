## Step-by-Step Reasoning & Matching Decisions:

**Overview of Logs:**  
- **Log A (System A)** has clear-cut event stages with limited attributes.
- **Log B (System B)** provides richer metadata (user_id, resource_id, notes) but uses slightly different event names and timestamps offset by a few seconds.

### Matching Strategy:
To reliably match events, we'll consider:
- **Order ID Matching**: Events must be for the same order to be matched.
- **Timestamp Closeness**: Events within ~2 seconds difference probably depict the same real-life event, considering different recording methodologies.
- **Event Names Semantics**: Use event name similarity to further confirm matches.

### Event-by-Event Analysis:

| Time (A)                 | Event (A)            | Time (B)                 | Event (B)           | Match? | Reasoning |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| 10:00:00                 | Order Received       | 09:59:58                 | OrderReceived       |      | Same event, 2-second offset |
| 10:01:30                 | Order Validated      | 10:01:29                 | OrderValidation     |      | Close timestamps, semantic equivalence |
| 10:02:00                 | Payment Processed    | 10:02:05                 | PaymentCheck        |      | Names differ slightly, but timestamps and semantics align (Payment) |
| -                        | *(no matching event)*| 10:03:00                 | Quality Check       |      | No matching event in Log A, unique to Log B |
| 10:05:00                 | Item Shipped         | 10:05:02                 | Shipping            |      | Clearly same, minimal offset (~2s difference) |
| 10:20:00                 | Item Delivered       | -                        | *(no matching event)*|      | Event absent in Log B (maybe System B doesn't log deliveries) |

### Decisions on Timestamps & Conflicts:
- We'll pick **System A’s timestamp** as our primary timeline, as it appears to be the main system of record.
- For merged events with slightly offset timestamps, we'll keep **System A’s timestamp** and include System B’s timestamp as an additional attribute (**secondary timestamp**).
- Unmatched events are included in the unified log, annotated as originating from a single log.

## Final Notes on Integration:
- Merged logs now offer enhanced visibility into the full order fulfillment scenario, combining System A's clear timeline with System B's richer metadata.
- Events unique to a single log are explicitly identified (to preserve data completeness).
- Minor conflicts in timestamps (around 1-2 seconds) are documented as secondary timestamps, honoring both logs.

This integrated view gives analysts a coherent, detailed audit trail—bridging system discrepancies and creating a unified process narrative.
