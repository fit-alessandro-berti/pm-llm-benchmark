Based on the provided BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) XML fragment, there are no explicit task elements defined. The snippet includes `sequenceFlow` elements which connect different nodes but does not specify what types of nodes these connections represent. Typically, tasks in a BPMN diagram would be represented by `bpmn:task`, `bpmn:userTask`, or other related elements such as gateways.

To identify the tasks in this process model, we need to see more details about the process elements that are referenced by `sourceRef` and `targetRef`. Without additional information on these nodes (like task definitions), it is not possible to list the specific tasks within this BPMN process model.

Here's a summary of what we do have:

- There are several sequence flow connections (`bpmn:sequenceFlow`) defined, indicating that there are multiple connected nodes in the process.
- The `sourceRef` and `targetRef` attributes suggest that these sequences connect various nodes (which could be tasks, gateways, events, or other BPMN elements), but their types are not provided.

For a complete list of tasks in this model, you would need to examine the full XML document where these references (`id1c963927-0fbe-4028-9d31-536a6e5362a9`, `idb86a1356-bb12-4a45-b1a3-d430cf587b6b`, etc.) are defined.
