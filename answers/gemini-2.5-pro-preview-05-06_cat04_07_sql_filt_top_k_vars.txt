Okay, here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task, along with a setup to create a sample `event_log` table and test the query.

```sql
-- 0. Setup: Create a sample event_log table and populate it
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE event_log (
    case_id INTEGER,
    activity VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO event_log (case_id, activity, timestamp) VALUES
-- Variant 1: A -> B -> C (3 cases)
(1, 'A', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
(1, 'B', '2023-01-01 10:05:00'),
(1, 'C', '2023-01-01 10:10:00'),
(2, 'A', '2023-01-02 11:00:00'),
(2, 'B', '2023-01-02 11:05:00'),
(2, 'C', '2023-01-02 11:10:00'),
(3, 'A', '2023-01-03 09:00:00'),
(3, 'B', '2023-01-03 09:05:00'),
(3, 'C', '2023-01-03 09:10:00'),

-- Variant 2: A -> D (2 cases)
(4, 'A', '2023-01-04 10:00:00'),
(4, 'D', '2023-01-04 10:05:00'),
(5, 'A', '2023-01-05 11:00:00'),
(5, 'D', '2023-01-05 11:05:00'),

-- Variant 3: X -> Y -> Z (1 case)
(6, 'X', '2023-01-06 12:00:00'),
(6, 'Y', '2023-01-06 12:05:00'),
(6, 'Z', '2023-01-06 12:10:00'),

-- Variant 4: A -> B (1 case - different from Variant 1)
(7, 'A', '2023-01-07 14:00:00'),
(7, 'B', '2023-01-07 14:05:00'),

-- Variant 5: E (1 case, single activity)
(8, 'E', '2023-01-08 15:00:00');

-- Set the value for K (e.g., Top 2 variants)
-- In a real application, K might be a parameter passed to the query.
-- For this example, we'll hardcode it in the relevant CTE.
-- Let K = 2
```

```sql
-- The main query
WITH
-- 1. Determine the sequence of activities for each case_id
CaseActivitySequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),

-- 2. Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants
-- 3. Count how many cases correspond to each variant
VariantFrequencies AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(case_id) AS frequency,
        list(case_id) AS case_ids_for_variant -- Useful for debugging or further analysis
    FROM
        CaseActivitySequences
    GROUP BY
        activity_sequence
),

-- Determine the top K variants by their frequency
TopKVariantSequences AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM
        VariantFrequencies
    ORDER BY
        frequency DESC
    LIMIT 2 -- This is our K value. Change as needed.
),

-- Identify all case_ids that belong to one of the top K variants
CasesInTopKVariants AS (
    SELECT
        cas.case_id
    FROM
        CaseActivitySequences cas
    JOIN
        TopKVariantSequences tkvs ON cas.activity_sequence = tkvs.activity_sequence
)

-- 4. Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases
--    which are part of these top K variants.
SELECT
    el.case_id,
    el.activity,
    el.timestamp
FROM
    event_log el
WHERE
    el.case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesInTopKVariants)
ORDER BY
    el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`CaseActivitySequences` CTE:**
    *   Groups events by `case_id`.
    *   For each `case_id`, it uses `string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp)` to concatenate the activity names into a single string, ordered by their `timestamp`. This string represents the process variant for that case.
        *   `' -> '` is used as a delimiter between activities. Choose a delimiter that is unlikely to appear in activity names themselves.

2.  **`VariantFrequencies` CTE:**
    *   Takes the output of `CaseActivitySequences`.
    *   Groups by the `activity_sequence` (the variant string).
    *   `COUNT(case_id)` calculates how many cases follow each unique variant (its frequency).
    *   `list(case_id)` is included for potential debugging or if you wanted to see which specific cases make up a variant, though it's not strictly necessary for the final step of this problem.

3.  **`TopKVariantSequences` CTE:**
    *   Selects `activity_sequence` from `VariantFrequencies`.
    *   `ORDER BY frequency DESC` sorts the variants from most frequent to least frequent.
    *   `LIMIT 2` (where 2 is our chosen K) picks only the top K variants. You would change `2` to your desired value of K.

4.  **`CasesInTopKVariants` CTE:**
    *   This CTE identifies all `case_id`s whose `activity_sequence` (determined in `CaseActivitySequences`) matches one of the sequences found in `TopKVariantSequences`.
    *   It effectively filters the `CaseActivitySequences` to include only those cases that follow one of the top K variants.

5.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   Selects all columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) from the original `event_log` table.
    *   The `WHERE el.case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesInTopKVariants)` clause filters the event log, ensuring that only events belonging to the cases identified in the `CasesInTopKVariants` CTE are returned.
    *   `ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp` is added for a well-ordered output, making it easier to verify.

**Output for K=2 (based on the sample data):**

With `K=2`, the top variants are "A -> B -> C" (frequency 3) and "A -> D" (frequency 2). The query will return all events for `case_id`s 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

| case\_id | activity | timestamp           |
| :------- | :------- | :------------------ |
| 1        | A        | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 |
| 1        | B        | 2023-01-01 10:05:00 |
| 1        | C        | 2023-01-01 10:10:00 |
| 2        | A        | 2023-01-02 11:00:00 |
| 2        | B        | 2023-01-02 11:05:00 |
| 2        | C        | 2023-01-02 11:10:00 |
| 3        | A        | 2023-01-03 09:00:00 |
| 3        | B        | 2023-01-03 09:05:00 |
| 3        | C        | 2023-01-03 09:10:00 |
| 4        | A        | 2023-01-04 10:00:00 |
| 4        | D        | 2023-01-04 10:05:00 |
| 5        | A        | 2023-01-05 11:00:00 |
| 5        | D        | 2023-01-05 11:05:00 |

This query effectively breaks down the problem into logical steps using CTEs, making it readable and maintainable.
