## Explanation of Logic

### Case Identification

Cases were defined by the **distinct document or task** the user interacted with. Each unique work artifact served as a case boundary:

| Case | Work Artifact | Rationale |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **CASE-001** | `Document1.docx` | All interactions with this Word document, including two separate editing sessions (before and after the email/PDF/Excel interlude), are unified into one case because they represent a continuous lifecycle of the same deliverable. |
| **CASE-002** | `Email – Annual Meeting` | The full open  read  reply  send cycle for a single email thread constitutes one self-contained task. |
| **CASE-003** | `Report_Draft.pdf` | A focused review session of a PDF (scrolling and highlighting) forms one review case. |
| **CASE-004** | `Budget_2024.xlsx` | An editing session of a single spreadsheet (open  edit  save) forms one case. |
| **CASE-005** | `Quarterly_Report.docx` | The user initially opened this document briefly (08:59:50), then returned later (09:07:15) to draft content and save. Both touches are grouped because they concern the same deliverable. |

### Activity Naming

Raw low-level actions were abstracted into **standardized, analyst-friendly activity names**:

| Raw Action(s) | Standardized Activity | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| `FOCUS` (first time on artifact) | **Open Document / Open Spreadsheet** | Represents the user beginning work on a new artifact. |
| `FOCUS` / `SWITCH` (return to artifact) | **Resume Editing** | Distinguishes a *return* to an already-opened artifact from an initial open, enabling analysts to detect multitasking and interruptions. |
| `TYPING` (in Word/Excel) | **Edit Content / Edit Data** | Generalized to reflect productive modification, with wording tailored to the application context. |
| `TYPING` (in email) | **Compose Reply** | Contextualized to email workflow. |
| `SCROLL` (in PDF) | **Review Content** | Scrolling in a read-only viewer signals reviewing, not editing. |
| `SCROLL` (in email) | **Read Email** | Same gesture, different semantic meaning in email context. |
| `HIGHLIGHT` | **Annotate Document** | Represents active markup/annotation of a PDF. |
| `CLICK` (Open/Reply/Send in email) | **Open Email / Initiate Reply / Send Email** | Mapped to the specific email workflow step described in the `Action` field. |
| `SAVE` | **Save Document / Save Spreadsheet** | Preserves the persistence event, important for compliance/audit trails. |
| `CLOSE` | **Close Document** | Marks the explicit end of work on an artifact. |

### Handling of SWITCH Events

`SWITCH` events are **transitional navigation actions** (alt-tabbing between windows). They do not represent productive work within any single case. They were handled as follows:
- If a `SWITCH` marks the user **returning** to a previously opened artifact, it was converted into a **"Resume Editing"** activity within that artifact's case (e.g., the switch back to Document1.docx at 09:06:00).
- Otherwise, the switch is implicitly captured by the subsequent **"Open"** event in the destination case, and the raw `SWITCH` row itself is not duplicated.

### Process Patterns Revealed

The resulting log enables analysts to discover patterns such as:
- **Multitasking/context-switching**: CASE-001 is interrupted mid-editing and resumed after three other tasks — a classic multitasking pattern.
- **Task lifecycle variants**: CASE-002 (email) follows a clean openreadreplysend path; CASE-003 (PDF review) is shorter and review-only.
- **Cross-case dependencies**: The user edited the budget spreadsheet (CASE-004) and then immediately returned to Document1.docx to insert a budget reference (CASE-001), suggesting a data-dependency between these two cases.
