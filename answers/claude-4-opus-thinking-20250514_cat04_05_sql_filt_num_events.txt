This is a well-structured prompt! Here are some suggestions to make it even clearer and more complete for a benchmark:

**Refined Prompt:**

"You have an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`, with each row representing a single event. The table has the following columns:
- `case_id` (string): Identifies which process instance the event belongs to
- `activity` (string): The name of the activity performed
- `timestamp` (timestamp): When the event occurred

**Task:** Write a DuckDB SQL query that returns all events from cases containing six or fewer events total. Any case with more than six events should be completely excluded from the results.

**Requirements:**
- Count the total number of events for each `case_id`
- Filter out all cases where this count exceeds six
- Return all columns from the original table for the remaining events
- The output should maintain the same schema as the input table

**Example:** If case 'A' has 4 events, case 'B' has 7 events, and case 'C' has 6 events, your query should return all events from cases 'A' and 'C' only."

**Key improvements:**
1. Added column data types for clarity
2. Specified that all columns should be returned
3. Added a concrete example to illustrate the expected behavior
4. Structured with clear sections (context, task, requirements, example)
5. Simplified "craft" to "write" for directness

This format would help ensure consistent responses and make it easier to automatically validate solutions.
