After analyzing the process variants, I can describe the process as follows:

**High-level Process Flow**

The process involves an employee submitting a declaration, which is then reviewed and approved or rejected at various stages. The ultimate goal of the process is to reach a final approval and payment handling.

**Stages of the Process**

1. **Submission**: An employee submits a declaration.
2. **Initial Review**: The submission is reviewed by administration, which can result in:
	* **Approval**: The submission is approved and sent to the next stage.
	* **Rejection**: The submission is rejected, and the process restarts from the beginning or returns to a previous stage.
3. **Intermediate Approvals**: Depending on the variant, the submission may require additional approvals from:
	* Input approver (Administrative or Pre-Approver)
	* Final approver (Supervisor)
	* Budget Owner
	* Repeated approvals may involve different approvers, such as BUDGET OWNER or SUPERVISOR.
4. **Final Approval**: The submission is finally approved by the SUPERVISOR, after which:
	* **Payment Handling**: The process reaches its final stage, and payment is handled.

**Variants and Process Branching**

The process variants show that there are multiple paths that the process can take, depending on the outcome of each stage. The frequency of each variant suggests that some paths are more common than others.

* The most common path involves immediate approval by ADMINISTRATION and subsequent approvals by BUDGET OWNER and SUPERVISOR (Variant 1: 4618 frequency).
* Variants with rejection at the early stages (e.g., Variant 9: 345 frequency, Variant 25: 174 frequency) indicate that the process often restarts from the beginning or returns to a previous stage after rejection.
* Variants with multiple rejections and repeated approvals (e.g., Variants 15, 23, 25, 31, 35) highlight the complexity of the process and the potential for lengthy review cycles.

Overall, this process appears to be a standardized workflow with multiple approval stages, designed to ensure that submissions meet certain criteria before reaching the final payment handling stage.
