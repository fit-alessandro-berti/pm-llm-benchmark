To determine the case groupings from the given sequence of hospital process events, we need to identify distinct patient journeys based on the attributes such as `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `department`. Here's how we can group the events into cases:

### Case 1: Patient with Age 45, Gender M

### Case 3: Patient with Age 28, Gender M

### Summary of Cases:
1. **Case 1:** Patient with Age 45, Gender M
2. **Case 2:** Patient with Age 62, Gender F
3. **Case 3:** Patient with Age 28, Gender M

These groupings are based on the unique combination of `patient_age` and `patient_gender` for each patient, ensuring that each case represents a distinct patient journey.
