Below is a structured set of open-ended questions to deepen understanding of the property onboarding process. They aim to clarify goals, roles, decision criteria, timing, handoffs, exceptions, and controls.

Overall objectives and scope
- What are the primary goals and success criteria for onboarding a new property (speed, compliance, landlord satisfaction, time-to-activation, revenue targets)?
- How do you define the “start” and “end” of the onboarding process, and what marks a successful handoff to steady-state operations?
- Which parts of this process vary by city or property type, and which are standardized?

Intake and documentation
- How do landlords typically initiate contact, and does the intake approach differ by channel (phone, email, portal, referral)?
- What specific documents are required by default, and what determines when additional documents are needed?
- How do you decide a document is “outdated” and what are acceptable alternatives if a document cannot be provided?
- What is your approach to verifying authenticity of deeds, compliance certificates, and inspection reports?
- How is missing or incorrect documentation tracked and followed up, and who owns that follow-up?

Data capture and property profile
- What information is mandatory versus optional when creating the property record?
- How do you handle ambiguous or conflicting property details (e.g., square footage discrepancies)?
- What becomes the single source of truth for property data, and how do you prevent data drift across tools?

Assignment of property manager
- What are the explicit criteria and thresholds for workload balancing and geographic specialization?
- How do you factor in experience with special property types and landlord preferences during assignment?
- When is reassignment considered, and how is that decision made and communicated?

Landlord alignment meeting
- What standard topics are covered in the introductory call, and how are decisions and special conditions captured and approved?
- How are custom policies (pets, maintenance, payment channels) documented and enforced across downstream steps?

Vendor scheduling: photography and inspection
- How do you select and schedule photographers and inspectors, and what SLAs or lead times do you target?
- What pre-inspection checks, if any, are performed to reduce inspection failures?
- When issues are found, how are repair scopes, costs, and timelines determined and approved (by whom and under what thresholds)?
- How is re-inspection handled, and how many cycles are typical before pass?

Marketing and pricing
- What is the approval process for listing content and images, and who has final sign-off?
- How do you determine the initial asking rent and update it as market data changes?
- What triggers a pricing review (time on market, inquiry volume, seasonal factors) and who can authorize changes?
- How do you handle properties with restrictions that affect marketing (e.g., student housing rules, HOA limits)?

Activation and systems integration
- What are the gating criteria to “activate” a property in the portal (compliance, inspection pass, data completeness)?
- What systems need to be updated at activation, and how do you verify they are in sync?
- How do you detect and resolve activation failures or listing errors?

Tenant application and screening
- What are the standard screening criteria (income multiples, credit score bands, eviction history), and how do they vary by city or landlord preference?
- How do you evaluate trade-offs when multiple applicants qualify (lease length, move-in date, concessions)?
- How are fair housing considerations embedded into the screening and decision process?
- What is the process for communicating decisions to applicants, and how are adverse action notices handled?

Lease negotiation and execution
- What is the standard lease template, and how are custom clauses introduced, reviewed, and approved?
- Who has authority to offer promotional discounts or modify terms (e.g., deposit amounts, pet fees), and under what conditions?
- How are security deposits collected, held, and reconciled with local regulations?

Move-in coordination and handoff
- How do you coordinate move-in activities (keys, access codes, utilities) and confirm readiness on day one?
- What constitutes a complete handoff from onboarding to the ongoing property management team, and how is that handoff documented?

Compliance, audit, and quality control
- What compliance checks are mandatory pre-activation, and which are post-activation?
- How do you ensure adherence to fair housing, data privacy, and local housing regulations throughout the process?
- What internal audits occur, how often, and what typical findings drive process changes?

Exception handling and special cases
- How do you handle properties requiring special insurance, unusual zoning, or occupancy restrictions?
- What is the escalation path for urgent issues (failed inspections, landlord disputes, system outages)?
- How do you manage landlords with nonstandard requirements or frequent change requests?
- What is the process if a landlord withdraws mid-onboarding or disputes pricing or lease terms?

Roles, responsibilities, and coordination
- Can you describe the RACI (who is responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) for each major step?
- Where do cross-team handoffs most commonly fail, and how are those risks mitigated?
- How is communication coordinated across email, CRM, and project tools to avoid duplication or loss?

Timing, SLAs, and workload
- What are the typical cycle times for each phase (documentation, inspection, marketing, activation), and what SLAs do you target?
- How do seasonal spikes or regional surges impact throughput, and what contingency plans are used?
- How do you prioritize properties when resources (inspectors, photographers, analysts) are constrained?

Data, tooling, and traceability
- Which tools are used at each step, and how do you maintain visibility across them?
- How is decision history (pricing changes, screening decisions, exceptions) recorded for traceability?
- What reports or dashboards do you rely on to monitor onboarding progress and bottlenecks?

Risk management and controls
- What are the most common failure points or risks, and what controls reduce their likelihood or impact?
- How do you manage vendor risks (availability, quality) and ensure they meet standards?
- How do you ensure data accuracy and prevent compliance drift over time?

Continuous improvement and feedback
- What feedback loops exist with landlords, tenants, and internal teams to improve the onboarding process?
- What metrics do you track to assess process health (time-to-activation, pass rate on first inspection, listing accuracy, tenant acceptance rate)?
- What recent changes have you made based on audits or lessons learned, and what improvements are on your roadmap?
