1. How might geopolitical tensions or trade policy shifts in key supplier regions (e.g., Taiwan, South Korea, Germany) disrupt the end-to-end supply chain, and what contingency strategies could mitigate such risks?

2. In what ways could the company leverage machine learning beyond demand forecasting듡or example, to dynamically adjust supplier selection based on real-time risk, cost, or quality metrics?

3. What are the hidden costs or inefficiencies in maintaining a 24/7 assembly operation in Malaysia, and how might automation or shift restructuring improve productivity or worker well-being?

4. How does the company balance the environmental impact of air freight versus ocean freight across different markets, and what metrics are used to evaluate sustainability trade-offs?

5. Could regionalizing more of the supply chain (e.g., building assembly plants closer to major markets) reduce lead times and carbon emissions드nd what would be the financial and operational trade-offs?

6. How do currency fluctuations across supplier and market regions affect pricing, margins, and procurement decisions드nd is there a formal hedging or dynamic pricing strategy in place?

7. What mechanisms are in place to ensure that quality issues detected at the distribution or retail level are traced back to specific suppliers or production batches for rapid corrective action?

8. How does the company align its just-in-time replenishment strategy with the unpredictability of global logistics (e.g., port delays, customs hold-ups) without risking stockouts?

9. In what ways could blockchain or digital twin technology enhance transparency and traceability across this multi-tier, multi-country supply chain?

10. How are labor and environmental compliance audits enforced across international suppliers, and what consequences exist for non-compliance beyond contract termination?

11. What role does product modularity or design-for-supply-chain play in allowing the company to substitute components from alternate suppliers during shortages without redesigning the entire smartphone?

12. How does the company handle the ethical and reputational risks associated with sourcing from regions with questionable labor practices or environmental records?

13. What data silos currently exist between R&D, procurement, manufacturing, and logistics드nd how might breaking them down lead to faster innovation or cost savings?

14. How are warranty and recall costs factored into supplier contracts, and what incentives exist for suppliers to improve component reliability upstream?

15. Could predictive analytics be used to anticipate regional demand spikes or drops before they occur, allowing for dynamic rerouting of shipments between distribution centers?

16. What cultural or communication barriers exist across the global teams managing this supply chain, and how do they impact decision-making speed or operational alignment?

17. How does the company measure and optimize the total cost of ownership for each component듩ot just purchase price, but including logistics, quality failures, and inventory carrying costs?

18. In what scenarios might direct-to-consumer shipping become more strategically important, and how would that reshape the role of regional distribution centers and retail partners?

19. How resilient is the current digital infrastructure (ERP, MES, TMS, etc.) to cyberattacks or system failures드nd what failover or redundancy protocols are in place?

20. What continuous improvement frameworks (e.g., Lean, Six Sigma, Theory of Constraints) are actively applied across this global supply chain, and how is their impact measured and scaled?
