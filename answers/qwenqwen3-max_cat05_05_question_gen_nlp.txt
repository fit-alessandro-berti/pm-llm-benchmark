1. How might geopolitical tensions or trade policy changes between key supplier countries (e.g., Taiwan, South Korea, U.S.) disrupt the availability or cost of critical smartphone components?  
2. In what ways could extended lead times from a single supplier—such as the microprocessor fab in Taiwan—cascade through the entire global supply chain, and how resilient is the current system to such disruptions?  
3. What strategies could the company employ to balance just-in-time inventory practices in high-demand markets with the need for buffer stock during unforeseen global disruptions (e.g., pandemics, port closures)?  
4. How does the company ensure consistent quality standards across components sourced from diverse international suppliers with varying regulatory and manufacturing norms?  
5. What are the environmental trade-offs between air freight (faster but higher emissions) and sea freight (slower but greener), and how does the company prioritize sustainability against speed-to-market?  
6. How might currency fluctuations across multiple supplier and market regions impact procurement costs, pricing strategies, and overall profitability?  
7. In what ways do digital systems and data analytics currently fail to capture real-time risks or opportunities in this multi-tiered supply network?  
8. How does the company manage compliance with conflicting or evolving environmental and labor regulations across its global supplier base and distribution footprint?  
9. What role does supplier diversification play in mitigating risk, and are there hidden costs or complexities associated with maintaining multiple qualified suppliers for the same component?  
10. How might machine learning–driven demand forecasting models inadvertently amplify the “bullwhip effect” if they overreact to short-term sales anomalies?  
11. What ethical considerations arise from relying on 24/7 manufacturing in Malaysia, and how are labor conditions monitored and enforced across subcontractors?  
12. How does the company coordinate warranty fulfillment and after-sales support across regions with vastly different consumer protection laws and service expectations?  
13. In the event of a product recall, how quickly can the company trace affected units through its supply chain, and what bottlenecks might delay remediation?  
14. What incentives or contractual mechanisms are used to align supplier performance (e.g., on-time delivery, defect rates) with the company’s broader operational goals?  
15. How does the reliance on specialized components (e.g., OLED screens from South Korea) create single points of failure, and what contingency plans exist?  
16. To what extent do regional distribution strategies account for cultural or regulatory differences in packaging, labeling, or product configuration?  
17. How might nearshoring or regionalization of assembly and distribution impact the company’s carbon footprint, costs, and responsiveness to local market shifts?  
18. What data silos or integration challenges exist between R&D, procurement, manufacturing, and logistics systems, and how do they hinder end-to-end visibility?  
19. How does the company evaluate the total cost of ownership for each transportation mode and logistics partner beyond just freight rates (e.g., insurance, delays, carbon taxes)?  
20. In what ways could circular economy principles—such as component reuse, repairability, or recycling—be integrated into this linear supply chain to reduce long-term environmental and regulatory risks?
