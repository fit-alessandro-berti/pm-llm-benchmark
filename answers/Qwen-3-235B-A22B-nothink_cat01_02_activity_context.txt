# Analysis and Renaming of Recurring Activities in Event Log

After analyzing the event log, I've identified two activities that recur within cases:
1. **Verify Documents**
2. **Call Customer**

These activities appear multiple times within the same case but have distinct contextual meanings based on their position in the process and associated context.

---

## 1. **Verify Documents**

This activity appears twice in cases C001 and C003, and has different meanings:

- **First occurrence**: Initial verification attempt where documents are checked for the first time
- **Second occurrence**: Re-verification after additional documents have been submitted or account adjustments have been made

**Revised names**:
- `Initial Document Verification` - for the first occurrence
- `Document Re-verification` - for the second occurrence

---

## 2. **Call Customer**

This activity appears in all three cases with different purposes:

- **C001**: Requesting missing documents
- **C002**: Clarifying account discrepancy, followed by a follow-up call
- **C003**: Customer left temporarily, calling to return

**Revised names**:
- `Request Missing Documents` - specific to C001 call
- `Account Clarification Call` - first call in C002
- `Follow-up Account Confirmation` - second call in C002
- `Customer Return Request Call` - specific to C003

## Justification for Naming Choices

### Verify Documents  `Initial Document Verification` and `Document Re-verification`
- The first verification is always an initial check, while the second occurs after additional information has been provided or changes have been made
- The context mentions "re-checks documents" and "after account adjustment" indicating it's a re-verification
- The new names clearly distinguish between the first check and subsequent verifications

### Call Customer  Context-Specific Names
- Each call has a different purpose: requesting missing documents, clarifying account discrepancies, and requesting customer return
- The descriptions mention different agents (FrontlineAgent vs. BranchOfficer) and different purposes
- The second call in C002 is explicitly described as a follow-up, warranting a distinct name
- Using specific names clarifies the intent of each call rather than using a generic "Call Customer"

These renaming decisions improve process transparency, facilitate better process analysis, and help in understanding the flow and purpose of each activity within the case.
