### Identified Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - **Average Time:** ~25 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** Very low (~10 minutes)
   - **Potential Issue:** This suggests a rigid or artificial approval process with minimal variability, possibly indicating that claims are being processed too quickly without necessary evaluation.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - **Average Time:** ~7 days
   - **Standard Deviation:** 2 days
   - **Potential Issue:** Such long delays could indicate significant bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the notification process, possibly due to manual oversight or resource constraints.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - **Average Time:** ~2 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour
   - **Potential Issue:** Closing a claim shortly after it is assigned without evaluation or approval steps might suggest premature closure or an attempt to bypass necessary review processes.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - **Average Time:** ~5 minutes
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute
   - **Potential Issue:** A very short time frame for transitioning from evaluation to notification could indicate skipping of intermediate steps or automated processing without adequate human verification.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

- **R to P (Receive to Approve):** The process may be overly automated, with claims being expedited through the approval stage due to missing manual reviews. This rapid transition might also reflect an attempt to reduce claim costs by minimizing time spent on evaluation.
  
- **P to N (Approve to Notify):** Long delays in notification could stem from a backlog of cases or limited staffing capacity during peak times, leading to slower processing and follow-up actions.

- **A to C (Assign to Close):** The quick closure without further steps might be influenced by adjusters prioritizing speed over thoroughness, possibly due to high claim volumes or pressure to meet internal deadlines.

- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** Extremely short intervals could indicate that some evaluations are being rushed or skipped entirely, potentially leading to inaccuracies in claims processing and settlements.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **Identify Claims with Abnormal Time Intervals:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp)) AS avg_seconds
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity IN ('R','A','E','P','N','C')
   GROUP BY claim_id;
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This query aggregates the average time between activities for each claim to identify outliers.

2. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters:**
   ```sql
   SELECT a.adjuster_id, a.name, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce.timestamp))
   FROM adjusters a
   JOIN claim_events ce ON a.adjuster_id = ce.resource
   WHERE activity IN ('R','A','E','P','N','C')
   GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name;
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This query examines whether specific adjusters are associated with longer or shorter delays between activities.

3. **Identify Anomalies by Claim Type:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_type, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp)) AS avg_seconds
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity IN ('R','A','E','P','N','C')
   GROUP BY claim_type;
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This helps to see if certain types of claims (e.g., home vs. auto) have significantly different timing patterns.

4. **Claims with Long Delays in Notification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp)) AS avg_seconds
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'N'
     AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp))) > 7
   GROUP BY claim_id;
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This identifies claims where notification occurs after a week, potentially indicating bottlenecks or issues in the notification process.

5. **Rapid Transition from Evaluation to Notification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp)) AS avg_seconds
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity IN ('E','N')
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp))) < 300
   GROUP BY claim_id;
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This query highlights claims where the time from evaluation to notification is unusually short, suggesting potential issues with the process flow or oversight.

These queries will help in analyzing specific cases and patterns within the data that correlate with the identified anomalies, providing insights into potential procedural inefficiencies or systemic issues.
