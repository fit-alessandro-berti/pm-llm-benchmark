Expected P2P flow (baseline): 
Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  Receive Goods/Services  Vendor Invoice Received  3way match (PO–GR–Invoice)  Release Payment  Close.

Findings by case:

- Case 1001 (baseline)
  - Sequence is clean and consistent with best practice: PR creation/approval  PO  GR  invoice  match  payment  close. No anomalies.

- Case 1002 (multiple severe control failures)
  - PO issued before PR approval (PO 2024-02-01 08:40; PR approved only on 2024-02-03 08:00).
    - Why problematic: circumvents spend authorization; violates approval controls/SoD; creates risk of unauthorized/”maverick” purchasing.
  - Invoice received and payment released before PR approval, before goods receipt, and before matching (Invoice 2024-02-03 07:00; Payment 07:15; GR only 2024-02-04; Match only 2024-02-05).
    - Why problematic: paying prior to 3way match and prior to receipt exposes the company to overpayment, duplicate payment, paying for undelivered/incorrect goods, and noncompliance with standard P2P controls.
  - 3way match performed after payment.
    - Why problematic: defeats the purpose of the match as a preventive control; becomes merely detective after cash has left.
  - Overall suggests “afterthefact” approval and settlement, a common audit red flag.

- Case 1003 (payment made before invoice and before receipt)
  - Payment released before invoice receipt, goods receipt, and matching (Payment 2024-02-08; Invoice 2024-02-09; GR 2024-02-10; Match 2024-02-11).
    - Why problematic: Unless this was a formally approved advance/down payment with specific terms and a dedicated process, this is a serious control breach (no invoice to validate, no receipt to confirm quantity/quality/price). Even if an advance was intended, it should be recorded through a downpayment process and blocked from standard payment runs until cleared by the final invoice.

- Case 1004 (receipt before PO)
  - Goods received before the PO was issued (GR 2024-02-06 09:00; PO 09:15).
    - Why problematic: indicates an afterthefact PO or receipt without a PO. Standard ERPs typically require a PO for GR; this pattern points to maverick buying or backdated POs, undermining price/terms control and making 3way matching unreliable.

Why these matter (crosscase risks):
- Financial: overpayments, paying for undelivered goods, duplicate payments, difficulty recovering funds.
- Compliance/audit: violations of approval and matching controls (SOX/ICFR), potential fraud risk, poor segregation of duties.
- Operational: inaccurate inventory and AP records; weak supplier performance accountability.

In short: 1001 is clean; 1002 and 1003 show critical “pay before match/receipt/approval” violations; 1004 shows “receive before PO” (afterthefact purchasing).
