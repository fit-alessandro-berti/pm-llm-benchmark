**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**  

---

### **Activities/Tasks**  
1. **Receive Invoice**  
   - Invoice arrives via email.  
2. **Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO)**  
   - Verify if the invoice includes a valid PO number.  
3. **Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
   - Record invoice details in the accounting system.  
4. **Forward to Purchasing Department**  
   - Send invoice to Purchasing for receipt confirmation.  
5. **Confirm Goods/Services Received**  
   - Purchasing verifies quantities, prices, and delivery details against the PO.  
6. **Match Invoice Line Items with PO**  
   - Compare invoice details with the PO in the system.  
7. **Resolve Discrepancies**  
   - Address mismatches (e.g., pricing, missing items).  
8. **Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor**  
   - For unresolved issues (e.g., missing PO, unresolvable discrepancies).  
9. **Request Manager Approval**  
   - Notify the Department Manager for final approval.  
10. **Schedule Payment**  
    - Initiate payment processing after approval.  
11. **Notify Supplier of Corrections**  
    - Contact supplier to resolve missing POs or pricing errors.  
12. **Create Retrospective PO**  
    - For invoices without a PO (e.g., informal services).

### **Sequence Flow**  
1. **Start**  **Receive Invoice**  
2. **Check for Valid PO**  
   - **If No PO**:  
      **Notify Supplier of Corrections** (via Karen)  
      **Create Retrospective PO** (if applicable)  
      **Log Invoice into System** (after PO is obtained)  
   - **If PO Exists**:  
      **Log Invoice into System**  
      **Forward to Purchasing**  
3. **Confirm Goods/Services Received**  
   - **If Discrepancy Found**:  
      **Resolve Discrepancies** (via Dan or Karen)  
      **Escalate to Supervisor** (if unresolved)  
      **Resume Normal Flow** (after resolution)  
   - **If No Discrepancy**:  
      **Match Invoice with PO**  
4. **Match Invoice with PO**  
   - **If Discrepancy Found**:  
      **Resolve Discrepancies** (via Dan or Karen)  
      **Escalate to Supervisor** (if unresolved)  
      **Resume Normal Flow** (after resolution)  
   - **If No Discrepancy**:  
      **Request Manager Approval**  
5. **Request Manager Approval**  
   - **If Approved**:  
      **Schedule Payment**  
   - **If Rejected**:  
      **Investigate Further** (via Mary or Carlos)  
      **Resume Normal Flow** (if resolved)  
6. **End**

### **Gateways/Decision Points**  
1. **PO Validation Gateway**  
   - *Condition*: "Is a valid PO number present?"  
   - *Outcomes*:  
     - **Yes**: Proceed to log invoice.  
     - **No**: Escalate to Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) for correction.  

2. **Discrepancy Resolution Gateway**  
   - *Condition*: "Are there mismatches in invoice details?"  
   - *Outcomes*:  
     - **Yes**: Resolve discrepancies (via Dan/Karen) or escalate to Rita.  
     - **No**: Proceed to manager approval.  

3. **Manager Approval Gateway**  
   - *Condition*: "Is the invoice approved by the Department Manager?"  
   - *Outcomes*:  
     - **Yes**: Schedule payment.  
     - **No**: Investigate further (unclear path; may loop back to discrepancy resolution).

### **Roles/Participants**  
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**: Receives invoices, checks POs, logs invoices, forwards to Purchasing, resolves discrepancies, schedules payments.  
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**: Confirms receipt of goods/services, resolves discrepancies, communicates with suppliers.  
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**: Approves invoices after verification.  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**: Escalates exceptions, coordinates with departments/suppliers for unresolved issues.  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**: Resolves supplier-related issues (e.g., missing POs, pricing errors).  

---

### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**  
- **Inputs**:  
  - Invoice (email attachment).  
  - Purchase Order (PO) details.  
- **Outputs**:  
  - Approved invoice for payment.  
  - Corrected invoice (if discrepancies exist).  
  - Retrospective PO (for informal services).  
- **Data Objects**:  
  - Accounting system records.  
  - Email notifications (approval requests, error alerts).  

---

### **Exceptions/Variations**  
1. **No PO Present**:  
   - Invoice is sent back to supplier for correction (via Karen).  
   - Rita may create a retrospective PO if the service is legitimate.  
2. **Discrepancies in Invoice**:  
   - Dan or Karen contacts the supplier to resolve issues.  
   - If unresolved, Rita escalates to resolve blocking issues.  
3. **Manager Rejection**:  
   - Unclear if the process loops back to discrepancy resolution or requires manual intervention.  
4. **Unresolved Exceptions**:  
   - Rita ensures invoices are not stuck indefinitely, but the exact resolution path is unspecified.  

---

### **Notes on Ambiguity**  
- The exact flow after **Manager Rejection** is unspecified (e.g., does it loop back to Mary for rework, or does it require direct intervention?).  
- The role of **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** in resolving discrepancies is indirect (e.g., she informs AP/Purchasing of correct pricing, but does not directly alter the invoice).  
- **Retrospective PO creation** is handled by Rita but lacks a defined trigger or workflow.
