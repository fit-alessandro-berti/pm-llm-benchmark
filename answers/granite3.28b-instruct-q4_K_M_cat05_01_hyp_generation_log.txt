**Identified Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors:**

1. **Case 1004: Non-Standard Process Flow**
   - Activity 'Receive Payment' occurred before 'Confirm Shipment', which is contrary to the standard process flow.
   
2. **Case 1002: Early Confirmation of Shipment**
   - The activity 'Confirm Shipment' was marked as attempted early ('attempted_early=Y'), indicating a deviation from the regular timeline.

3. **Credit Check Discrepancies:**
   - In Case 1002, Credit Check occurred after 'Validate Stock', which is not part of the standard process flow. It should ideally come before or concurrently with stock validation to ensure timely decision-making on order acceptance.

**Hypotheses for These Anomalies:**

1. **Case 1004: Non-Standard Process Flow (Receive Payment before Confirm Shipment)**
   - *Possible Reasons*: This might be due to a system error where the 'Confirm Shipment' event was inadvertently marked as 'N' (no) instead of 'Y' (yes), or possibly a manual override without proper documentation. It could also indicate a policy breach, where urgent payment scenarios exist that aren't part of standard procedures.

2. **Case 1002: Early Confirmation of Shipment**
   - *Possible Reasons*: This might be due to an eager resource (LogisticsMgr) trying to move the process along quickly, possibly influenced by external pressures or misunderstanding of workflow priorities. It could also indicate a system bug allowing early confirmations.

3. **Credit Check Discrepancy in Case 1002**
   - *Possible Reasons*: This anomaly might suggest a lack of clear communication or coordination between departments, with the logistics team pushing for shipment confirmation without ensuring credit approval is complete. Alternatively, it could point to a resource (LogisticsMgr) not strictly adhering to established process steps.

**Proposed SQL Queries:**

1. **Investigating Case 1004's Anomaly:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       o.order_type,
       o.order_value,
       rl.activity,
       rl.timestamp
   FROM 
       order_event_log rl 
   JOIN 
       orders o ON rl.case_id = o.case_id
   WHERE 
       rl.case_id = 1004 AND rl.activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods')
   ORDER BY 
       rl.timestamp ASC;
   ```

   This query aims to review the sequence of events leading up to 'Receive Payment' in Case 1004, specifically focusing on any 'Confirm Shipment' or 'Ship Goods' activities that occurred before 'Receive Payment'.

2. **Exploring Early Confirmation in Case 1002:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       rl.* 
   FROM 
       order_event_log rl 
   WHERE 
       rl.case_id = 1002 AND rl.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
       AND rl.timestamp < (SELECT rl2.timestamp FROM order_event_log rl2 WHERE rl2.case_id = 1002 AND rl2.activity = 'Ship Goods')
   ORDER BY 
       rl.timestamp ASC;
   ```

   This query aims to identify any instances where the 'Confirm Shipment' activity timestamp is earlier than the subsequent 'Ship Goods' activity for Case 1002, highlighting potential early confirmations.

3. **Examining Credit Check Timing in Case 1002:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       rl.* 
   FROM 
       order_event_log rl 
   JOIN 
       resources r ON rl.resource = r.resource_id 
   WHERE 
       rl.case_id = 1002 AND rl.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
       AND r.role != 'Credit Officer' -- Assuming only Credit Officers should perform credit checks
   ORDER BY 
       rl.timestamp ASC;
   ```

   This query aims to find any resource other than a Credit Officer performing the 'Perform Credit Check' activity, potentially indicating a miscommunication or role confusion in Case 1002's process.
