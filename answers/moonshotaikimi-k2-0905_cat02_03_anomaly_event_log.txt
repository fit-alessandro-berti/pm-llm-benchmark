Anomalies seen in the log – and the business problems they create  

1. Case 1002 – “Approve” after the PO has already been issued and the invoice has already been paid  
   Sequence (chronological):  
   …08:40 Issue PO    07:00 Vendor Invoice    07:15 Release Payment    08:00 Approve PR  

   What is wrong  
   - The formal approval of the purchase requisition is missing when the PO is printed.  
   - Payment is released before anyone has even approved that the money may be committed.  
   Consequences: SOX/audit finding, possible duplicate or fraudulent payment, no budget check done.  

2. Case 1002 – Goods received after the invoice is paid  
   Sequence: Release Payment (03-Feb 07:15)    Receive Goods (04-Feb 09:00)  

   What is wrong  
   A vendor was paid although the organisation has not yet verified that the goods were delivered in the agreed quantity/quality.  
   Consequences: No leverage if the shipment is short or damaged; reclaiming money is difficult; working-capital risk.  

3. Case 1002 – Invoice-to-PO matching done after payment instead of before  
   The standard control “three-way-match” (PO = receipt = invoice) is executed only after cash has left the company.  

   Consequences: Duplicate invoices, price differences or unauthorised invoices are detected too late; weak internal control.  

4. Case 1003 – Payment executed before the invoice and before the goods arrived  
   Sequence: Issue PO (02-Feb 10:00)    Release Payment (08-Feb 11:00)    Invoice (09-Feb) and goods (10-Feb)  

   What is wrong  
   Exactly the same control failure as above, only even more extreme: the vendor is prepaid for goods it has not yet invoiced or shipped.  
   Consequences: Financial exposure if the vendor never delivers; possible interest loss; audit exception for “payment without obligation”.  

5. Case 1004 – Goods receipt before the purchase order exists  
   Sequence: … Approve PR    Receive Goods (06-Feb 09:00)    Issue PO (06-Feb 09:15)  

   What is wrong  
   The warehouse accepted goods that had not yet been ordered formally – the PO number that the receiver writes on the delivery note did not exist at the time of receipt.  
   Consequences: GR/IR account is out of balance; price/quantity conditions are unknown; possible return-shipment costs; evidence of “after-the-fact PO”, often forbidden in corporate purchasing policies.  

Collectively these anomalies show systematic breakdown of the basic P2P control sequence:  
PR approval  PO  GR  Invoice  Match  Pay.  

Cases 1002–1004 each violate at least one sequencing rule that auditors typically test, exposing the company to over-payments, fraud, and compliance findings.
