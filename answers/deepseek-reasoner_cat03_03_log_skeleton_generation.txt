To model the complex order fulfillment process as a Log Skeleton, we define constraints based on the required sequence of activities and their relationships. The process follows a strict linear flow where each activity must occur exactly once, with direct succession between steps and specific dependencies.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('IC', 'RP')},
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),
        ('RI', 'CA'),
        ('PI', 'RI'),
        ('QC', 'PI'),
        ('PO', 'QC'),
        ('GSL', 'PO'),
        ('D', 'GSL'),
        ('IC', 'D'),
        ('RP', 'IC')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    },
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Equivalence:** `('IC', 'RP')` ensures invoicing and payment recording occur the same number of times.
2. **Always Before:** Each activity requires its predecessor to have occurred (e.g., `Check Availability` requires `Receive Order`).
3. **Always After:** Each activity must be followed by its successor (e.g., `Receive Order` must eventually lead to `Check Availability`).
4. **Never Together:** No activities are mutually exclusive.
5. **Activity Occurrences:** All activities occur exactly once.
6. **Directly-Follows Constraints:** Each activity must immediately precede its successor in the workflow (e.g., `Pack Order` is directly followed by `Generate Shipping Label`).

This model enforces a strict sequential process with no deviations, retries, or concurrency, aligning with the described order fulfillment steps.
