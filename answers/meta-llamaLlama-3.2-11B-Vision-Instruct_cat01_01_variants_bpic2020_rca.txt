To identify the root causes for the performance issues in the process, we need to analyze the data and process variants. Here are some insights:

1. **High performing variants:**
   - The variant with the highest performance is: "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" with a performance of 810187.903.
   - Other high performing variants include: "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" and "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled".

2. **Low performing variants:**
   - The variant with the lowest performance is: "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION ( frequency = 5  performance = 13805869.200 )". This variant has a very high frequency, but it is rejected at the administration level, which may indicate a bottleneck or inefficiency in this step.
   - Other low performing variants include: "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" and "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled".

3. **Rejection rates:**
   - The highest rejection rate is observed at the administration level, with a total of 36 variants being rejected at this stage.
   - The administration level is also the most common rejection point, with 11 variants being rejected and then resubmitted.

4. **Variants with high frequency and low performance:**
   - The variant "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" has a high frequency (5) but a very low performance (13805869.200).
   - Other variants with high frequency and low performance include: "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPRO
