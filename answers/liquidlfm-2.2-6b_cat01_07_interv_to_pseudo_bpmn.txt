# **Process Model: Invoice Approval Process Described via Empirical Interview Data**  

This BPMN-like textual model synthesizes interviews with key participants documenting **the typical invoice approval process** as experienced across supply chain departments. Due to variant accounts and uncertainties, some path choices are indicated explicitly.  

---

## **Process Overview**

### **Primary Roles Involved**  
- Accounts Payable Clerk (APC)  
- Purchasing Officer (PO)  
- Department Manager (DM)  
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (APS)  
- Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)  

Other system entities and documents are implied as artifacts or input/outputs.

## **Key Process Activities**

1. **Invoice Receipt & Validation**  
   - APC receives an invoice either electronically or via email.  
   - Verifies presence and validity of PO number.  
     - If **invalid (no PO)**: Sends back request to supplier for PO details. (Decision Point 1)  
   - If **valid PO exists**: Logs invoice in accounting system.  

2. **Initial Record Matching**  
   - Logged invoice assigned to APC for next step.  
   - **Gateway 1**:  
     - If invoice line items **match PO**:  
       - Proceed to next step.  
     - If line items **do not match PO**: Send to Purchasing for discrepancy resolution or escalation. (Decision Point 2)  
   - If **PO missing despite receipt**:  
     - APC informs APR or Jos/Managers to collect missing info.  

3. **Discrepancy Handling**  
   - APC contacts Purchasing or Supplier (depending on issue type):  
     - Clarify pricing, quantities, or missing items.  
   - Issues **resolved**  Escalated to supervisor (APS) if unresolved by PO team.  
   - Suspicious invoices (e.g., large variance vs budget, unexpected line items): Received for manual investigation or hold by APS; provided details to PM. (Optional exception)  

4. **Purchasing Validation**  
   - PO with matched invoice forwarded to PO.  
   - PO verifies completeness and correctness (quantities, pricing, delivery details).  
   - Confirmation email sent to APC or PM.  
   - If missing PO: Inform PS to request resolution before proceeding. (Logical case: repeated across multiple p. But treated as one condition here)  

5. **Manager Approval Decision**  
   - PO complete with verified invoice  Notification to DM.  
   - **Gateway 2**:  
     - If invoice **matches requirements & approved by PO**:  
       - DM reviewed and approves  (Output: Proceed to payment processing).  
     - If **missing or disputed info**: DM needs more info or clarification  Escalation to next step (e.g., AP to CS, or back to PM with escalated exception).  

6. **Final Approval & Exception Handling by APS**  
   - PM approval triggers final sign-off; APS monitors exceptions:  
     - Escalated invoices held until investigation.  
     - Optional routine for “informal services invoices”  create retrospective PO or reject with closure notes.  
   - APS forwards resolved invoices to mandatory AP/Scheduling (not explicitly modeled here but implied).

## **Sequence Flow**

1. **Invoice Received By APC  Check PO (Decision 1)**  
    **Yes (PO valid):** Log in system.  
    **No (No PO):** Send back to supplier or escalate (Escalation to Jos or PM).  

   If Directly escalated/no PO resolved:  
    **Get PO Complete** or  
    **Suspicion flag  Held / Investigate**  Continue after resolution.

2. **If Invoice Matches PO  Initiate Discrepancy Processing (Galley 2)**  
    Purchasing reviews  
       Match All Items  Notify PM  
       Discrepancy / Missing Info  Escalate clearly per agreed tiers (APC  PJ  ^SRM or PS).  
    Once Invoice Resolvable:  
       Forward to DM for final approval.  

3. **DM approves or holds for clarification  Escalation Loop if unresolved.**  

4. **Manager approved invoice  Proceed to payment scheduling** (implied).

## **Exception & Variation Handling**  

| Situation                                    | Path Taken                                               |  
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|  
| Invoice lacks PO number                       | APC informs supplier/jos to provide PO before proceeding. |  
| Mismatch between invoice and PO               | Contacted Purchasing or supplier for clarification or correction. |  
| Approved Purchase Order but missing data      | Reserved for investigation or escalated review.          |  
| Discrepancy causing "significant" variance     | Pending investigation under SRM guidance.                |  
| Routine invoice with informal terms           | Closed or retroactively converted into P vintage (APS action). |  
| APS intervention needed (for hold/review)     | Holds invoice in system loop until resolved; carried over until PM escalation. |

## **Artifacts / Inputs / Outputs**  

- **Documents mentioned:**  
  - Purchase Order (PO)  
  - Invoice (details line items, total amount, dating, PO reference)  
  - Contract (for SRM to reference pricing)  
- **Data object passed:**  
  - Invoice details + PO number (key integrity for flow trigger)  
  - Amendment request/receipt when discrepancies exist  
- **Outputs:**  
  - Approved invoice (final for payment processing)

## **Roles Summary**

| Role                  | Primary Responsibilities                                 |  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|  
| Accounts Payable Clerk | Receives invoices, checks PO compliance, initial validation, escalation on errors. |  
| Purchasing Officer    | Verifies invoice consistency with PO, corrects or flags discrepancies. |  
| Department Manager    | Validates invoices against budgets/approvals before final sign-off. |  
| Accounts Payable Supervisor | Executes escalations for unresolved issues; governs rework loops. |  
| Supplier Relationship Manager | Ensures suppliers provide PO numbers or corrected invoices. |

## **Union with Model Constructs (BPMN Typical Elements)**  

1. **Start Event** – Invoice received by APC.  
2. **Gateway 1 (Decision Point)** – No PO? Advisory to supplier or missing info?  
3. **Task/Swing Action (Sub-process)** – Discrepancy escalation chain.  
4. **Gateway 2** – Manager approval gate.  
5. **End Event** – Approved invoice ready for payment.  
6. Artifacts displayed as **data objects moving** across tasks.  
7. **Repeat and Multiple Paths** respected (e.g., multiple escalation triggers from same event, e.g., supplier refusal, budget variance).  
8. **Flash events** could indicate holding/movement in exception queues (implicit in notes).

*Note*: Conflicts noted:  
- Mary (APC) specifies *automated prompt from system* to escalate to supervisor with unresolved issues; Dan asserts supplier contact for PO missing cases — minor divergence resolved via supplier intervention (either via MSG via PO or P&L team action). Specified outcomes differ slightly in escalation criteria, hence the branching logic.

This structured textual model is designed for conversion into a visual BPMN diagram with clear explicit gateways, tasks, and message flows, while documenting uncertainty and exceptions where interview narratives were inconsistent.
