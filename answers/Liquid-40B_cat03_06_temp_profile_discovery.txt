To generate a temporal profile for the given process, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities in the process variants. Here's a Python code snippet to calculate the temporal profile:

```python
import numpy as np

process_variants = [
    # ... (all process variants)
]

temporal_profile = {}

for variant in process_variants:
    activities = variant.split(' -> ')
    for i in range(len(activities) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(activities)):
            activity_pair = (activities[i], activities[j])
            if activity_pair in temporal_profile:
                avg, stdev = temporal_profile[activity_pair]
                avg += variant[i + 1:j + 1]
                stdev += variant[i + 1:j + 1]
            else:
                temporal_profile[activity_pair] = (variant[i + 1:j + 1], variant[i + 1:j + 1])

for activity_pair, values in temporal_profile.items():
    avg, stdev = values
    avg /= len(process_variants)
    stdev /= len(process_variants)
    temporal_profile[activity_pair] = (avg, stdev)

print(temporal_profile)
```

This code snippet calculates the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities in the process variants and stores the results in a dictionary called `temporal_profile`. The output will be a dictionary with the activity pairs as keys and the average and standard deviation of the times between them as values.
