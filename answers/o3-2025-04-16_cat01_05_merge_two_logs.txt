Explanation of matching & conflict resolution
1. Timestamp tolerance  
   • Started with a 2-second window; all paired events except “Payment” fell within it.  
   • “Payment Processed/PaymentCheck” differed by 5 s but had identical order_id and correct sequence position, so tolerance was relaxed to 10 s for that pair only.

2. Name harmonisation  
   System B  Canonical  
   • OrderReceived Order Received  
   • OrderValidation Order Validated  
   • PaymentCheck Payment Processed  
   • Shipping Item Shipped  
   • Quality Check kept as-is (no System A counterpart).

3. Primary timestamp  
   When both systems reported the same event, the earlier of the two was chosen as “primary_ts”. Original per-system stamps are retained in dedicated columns.

4. Attribute union  
   All attributes present in either log were kept. Missing values are left blank.

5. Origin flag  
   A+B  = merged event found in both logs  
   A-only = appears only in System A  
   B-only = appears only in System B

6. Unmatched events  
   • “Quality Check” appears only in System B – included unchanged.  
   • “Item Delivered” appears only in System A – included unchanged.

The resulting integrated log preserves complete chronological order, unifies naming, and aggregates every attribute recorded by either source.
