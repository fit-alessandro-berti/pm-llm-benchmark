Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. We have an event log for customer support tickets, and we need to identify which cases take significantly longer than average to resolve. Then, we need to figure out why those cases are taking longer and suggest some improvements.

First, let's list out the cases and calculate the total resolution time for each. The resolution time is the time from when the ticket was received to when it was closed.

Case 101:
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:00
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 10:15
Total time: From 08:00 to 10:15 is 2 hours and 15 minutes.

Case 102:
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:15
Total time: From 08:05 on March 1 to 09:15 on March 2. That's 1 day and 1 hour and 10 minutes. But let's calculate it in hours for consistency. From 08:05 to 08:05 next day is 24 hours, then plus 1 hour and 10 minutes, so 25 hours and 10 minutes.

But wait, the dates are important here. March 1 08:05 to March 2 09:15 is 25 hours and 10 minutes.

Case 103:
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:10
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:30
Total time: 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Case 104:
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:20
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:30
Total time: From 08:20 on March 1 to 08:30 on March 2 is 24 hours and 10 minutes.

Case 105:
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:25
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:30
Total time: From 08:25 on March 1 to 09:30 on March 3. That's 2 days and 1 hour and 5 minutes. In hours, that's 48 hours and 5 minutes.

Now, let's list the total resolution times:
- Case 101: 2 hours 15 minutes
- Case 102: 25 hours 10 minutes
- Case 103: 1 hour 20 minutes
- Case 104: 24 hours 10 minutes
- Case 105: 48 hours 5 minutes

To find the average resolution time, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation.

Case 101: 2 hours 15 minutes = 135 minutes
Case 102: 25 hours 10 minutes = 1510 minutes
Case 103: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
Case 104: 24 hours 10 minutes = 1450 minutes
Case 105: 48 hours 5 minutes = 2885 minutes

Total time for all cases: 135 + 1510 + 80 + 1450 + 2885 = 6060 minutes
Average time: 6060 / 5 = 1212 minutes = 20 hours and 12 minutes.

Now, which cases are significantly longer than the average? The average is about 20 hours. Let's see:
- Case 101: 2.25 hours (much less than average)
- Case 102: 25.17 hours (slightly above average)
- Case 103: 1.33 hours (much less than average)
- Case 104: 24.17 hours (slightly above average)
- Case 105: 48.08 hours (more than twice the average)

So, Case 105 is significantly longer than the average. Cases 102 and 104 are somewhat above average but not as extreme as Case 105.

But let's think about what "significantly longer" means. If we consider the average is about 20 hours, then cases that take more than, say, 24 hours might be considered significantly longer. So Cases 102, 104, and 105 are above 24 hours. But Case 105 is way higher than the others.

But to be precise, let's calculate the standard deviation to see what's truly an outlier.

First, let's list the times in hours for easier calculation:
- Case 101: 2.25 hours
- Case 102: 25.17 hours
- Case 103: 1.33 hours
- Case 104: 24.17 hours
- Case 105: 48.08 hours

Average is 20.12 hours (as calculated earlier).

Now, calculate the squared differences from the mean:
- (2.25 - 20.12)^2 = (-17.87)^2 = 319.34
- (25.17 - 20.12)^2 = (5.05)^2 = 25.50
- (1.33 - 20.12)^2 = (-18.79)^2 = 353.06
- (24.17 - 20.12)^2 = (4.05)^2 = 16.40
- (48.08 - 20.12)^2 = (27.96)^2 = 781.76

Total squared differences: 319.34 + 25.50 + 353.06 + 16.40 + 781.76 = 1496.06

Variance = 1496.06 / 5 = 299.21
Standard deviation = sqrt(299.21)  17.3 hours

Now, a common rule is that values more than 1 standard deviation above the mean are considered above average, and more than 2 standard deviations are outliers.

Mean + 1 SD = 20.12 + 17.3  37.42 hours
Mean + 2 SD = 20.12 + 34.6  54.72 hours

Case 105 is at 48.08 hours, which is between 1 and 2 SD above the mean. Cases 102 and 104 are below 1 SD above the mean.

But in practical terms, Case 105 is taking almost twice as long as the next longest case (Case 104 at 24 hours vs. Case 105 at 48 hours). So perhaps Case 105 is the main outlier.

But let's look at all cases above average. The average is 20.12 hours, so Cases 102, 104, and 105 are above average. But to identify "significantly longer," perhaps we'd consider cases that are more than, say, 24 hours (which is roughly mean + 0.25 SD, but let's not get too statistical). Alternatively, we could say that cases taking more than 24 hours are significantly longer since the average is about 20 hours.

But looking at the data, Cases 102 and 104 are around 24-25 hours, and Case 105 is at 48 hours. Maybe it's better to consider Case 105 as the significant outlier and Cases 102 and 104 as moderately delayed.

But let's see what's happening in these cases.

Looking at Case 105:
- Receive to Triage: 10 minutes
- Triage to Assign: 25 minutes
- Assign to Investigate: 10 minutes
- Investigate to Escalate: 1 hour (from 09:10 to 10:00) — but wait, the sequence is:
  - Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:00
  - Investigate Issue: 09:10
  - Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 10:00
So from Assign to Escalate is about 1 hour (from 09:00 to 10:00), but the investigation started at 09:10 and escalated at 10:00, so investigation took 50 minutes before escalation.
Then from Escalate to next Investigate: from 10:00 on March 1 to 14:00 on March 2 is about 28 hours (from 10:00 March 1 to 10:00 March 2 is 24 hours, plus 4 more hours to 14:00, so 28 hours).
Then from that investigation to resolve: from 14:00 March 2 to 09:00 March 3 is about 19 hours.
Then resolve to close: 30 minutes.

So the big delays are:
1. From escalation to next investigation: 28 hours
2. From second investigation to resolution: 19 hours

Case 102:
- Receive to Triage: 25 minutes
- Triage to Assign: 30 minutes
- Assign to Escalate: 2 hours 30 minutes (from 09:00 to 11:30)
- Escalate to Investigate: 2 hours 30 minutes (from 11:30 to 14:00 same day)
Wait, no, in Case 102:
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:00
- Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 11:30 (so 2 hours 30 minutes to escalate)
- Then Investigate Issue at 14:00 same day (so 2 hours 30 minutes after escalation)
- Then from Investigate to Resolve: from 14:00 March 1 to 09:00 March 2 is about 19 hours
- Then Resolve to Close: 15 minutes

So the big delay is from investigation to resolution: 19 hours.

Case 104:
- Receive to Triage: 40 minutes
- Triage to Assign: 30 minutes
- Assign to Investigate: 3 hours 30 minutes (from 09:30 to 13:00)
- Investigate to Resolve: from 13:00 March 1 to 08:00 March 2 is about 19 hours
- Resolve to Close: 30 minutes

Here, the delay is from investigation to resolution: about 19 hours.

Case 101 (fast case for comparison):
- Receive to Triage: 10 minutes
- Triage to Assign: 10 minutes
- Assign to Investigate: 40 minutes
- Investigate to Resolve: 1 hour
- Resolve to Close: 15 minutes
Total time is short, and no escalation.

Case 103 (another fast case):
- Receive to Triage: 5 minutes
- Triage to Assign: 15 minutes
- Assign to Investigate: 15 minutes
- Investigate to Resolve: 30 minutes
- Resolve to Close: 15 minutes
Again, no escalation.

From this, we can see that cases with escalations (Cases 102, 105) tend to take longer. Also, in Cases 102, 104, and 105, there's a significant delay between the investigation step and the resolution step.

But in Case 105, there's an additional escalation step that seems to cause a long delay. Let's look at the escalation steps more closely.

In Case 102:
- Escalated to Level-2 at 11:30, then investigation by Level-2 starts at 14:00 same day (2.5 hours later), then resolution takes until next day 09:00 (about 19 hours after investigation starts).

In Case 105:
- First investigation by Level-1 starts at 09:10, escalated to Level-2 at 10:00 (50 minutes after investigation starts).
- Then next investigation (presumably by Level-2) starts at 14:00 next day (about 28 hours later).
- Then resolution is at 09:00 the following day (about 19 hours after that investigation starts).

In Case 104 (no escalation):
- Investigation starts at 13:00, resolution at 08:00 next day (about 19 hours later).

Hmm, so in all cases with long resolution times (102, 104, 105), there's a long delay between the investigation step and the resolution step. But in Case 105, there's an additional long delay between escalation and the next investigation.

But in Case 102, the delay between escalation and investigation is only 2.5 hours, but the investigation to resolution is 19 hours. In Case 104 (no escalation), investigation to resolution is also about 19 hours. In Case 105, there's an extra long delay between escalation and investigation (28 hours), plus another 19 hours from investigation to resolution.

So perhaps the main issue is the time taken from investigation to resolution, which is consistently around 19 hours in the slow cases. But in Case 105, there's an additional delay due to escalation.

But let's think about what "investigation" and "resolution" mean. Investigation is when the agent is actively looking into the issue, and resolution is when they actually fix it. A long time between investigation and resolution could mean that the issue is complex and takes time to fix, or that the agent is waiting for something (like parts, or approval, or customer response).

But in the cases without escalation (like 101 and 103), investigation to resolution is quick (1 hour and 30 minutes respectively). In the slow cases, it's about 19 hours. Maybe the issues in the slow cases are more complex and require more time to resolve.

But Case 105 has an escalation, which might indicate that the issue was too complex for Level-1 and needed Level-2, which could add delay. But in Case 102, there's also an escalation, but the investigation to resolution time is similar to Case 104 which didn't have an escalation.

Wait, in Case 102:
- Escalate to Level-2 at 11:30
- Investigate Issue at 14:00 same day (so Level-2 starts investigating 2.5 hours after escalation)
- Then resolution at 09:00 next day (about 19 hours after investigation starts)

In Case 105:
- First investigation by Level-1 at 09:10, escalated at 10:00 (so Level-1 investigated for 50 minutes before escalating)
- Then next investigation at 14:00 next day (so about 28 hours after escalation)
- Then resolution at 09:00 the day after (about 19 hours after that investigation starts)

So in Case 105, there's a long delay between escalation and when Level-2 starts investigating (28 hours vs. 2.5 hours in Case 102). That's a big difference.

So perhaps the issue is that when tickets are escalated to Level-2, sometimes there's a long delay before Level-2 starts investigating. In Case 102, Level-2 started investigating 2.5 hours after escalation, but in Case 105, it took 28 hours.

But why the difference? Maybe Level-2 availability or prioritization is an issue. Maybe Level-2 agents are not always available, or escalated tickets aren't being prioritized properly.

Also, in all slow cases (102, 104, 105), the time from investigation to resolution is about 19 hours. Maybe that's just how long it takes to resolve certain types of issues, but in the fast cases (101, 103), it's much quicker. So maybe the nature of the issue affects resolution time, but the escalation process can add additional delays.

But let's see if we can find a pattern in the activities leading to delays.

Potential issues:
1. Escalation to Level-2 can add significant delay if Level-2 doesn't start investigating quickly (as in Case 105).
2. Even without escalation, some investigations take a long time to resolve (as in Cases 102 and 104), suggesting that some issues are inherently more complex or require more time.

But in Case 104, there's no escalation, but the investigation to resolution time is still long (19 hours). So escalation isn't the only factor.

Perhaps the key is to look at the time between activities. Let's calculate the time between each activity for all cases.

Case 101:
1. Receive to Triage: 10 minutes
2. Triage to Assign: 10 minutes
3. Assign to Investigate: 40 minutes
4. Investigate to Resolve: 1 hour
5. Resolve to Close: 15 minutes
Total: 2 hours 15 minutes

Case 102:
1. Receive to Triage: 25 minutes
2. Triage to Assign: 30 minutes
3. Assign to Escalate: 2 hours 30 minutes
4. Escalate to Investigate: 2 hours 30 minutes
5. Investigate to Resolve: 19 hours
6. Resolve to Close: 15 minutes
Total: 25 hours 10 minutes

Case 103:
1. Receive to Triage: 5 minutes
2. Triage to Assign: 15 minutes
3. Assign to Investigate: 15 minutes
4. Investigate to Resolve: 30 minutes
5. Resolve to Close: 15 minutes
Total: 1 hour 20 minutes

Case 104:
1. Receive to Triage: 40 minutes
2. Triage to Assign: 30 minutes
3. Assign to Investigate: 3 hours 30 minutes
4. Investigate to Resolve: 19 hours
5. Resolve to Close: 30 minutes
Total: 24 hours 10 minutes

Case 105:
1. Receive to Triage: 10 minutes
2. Triage to Assign: 25 minutes
3. Assign to Investigate: 10 minutes
4. Investigate to Escalate: 50 minutes
5. Escalate to Investigate: 28 hours
6. Investigate to Resolve: 19 hours
7. Resolve to Close: 30 minutes
Total: 48 hours 5 minutes

From this, we can see that in the slow cases (102, 104, 105), the biggest delays are between investigation and resolution (about 19 hours in all three). But in Case 105, there's an additional large delay between escalation and the next investigation (28 hours).

In Case 102, the delay between escalation and investigation is only 2.5 hours, which is similar to the delay between assign and escalation (2.5 hours). But in Case 105, the delay between escalation and investigation is much longer (28 hours).

So, one potential issue is that escalations to Level-2 can sometimes take a long time before investigation begins (as in Case 105). Another issue is that even without escalation, some investigations take a long time to resolve (as in Cases 102 and 104).

But why is the investigation to resolution time so long in some cases? Maybe these cases involve issues that require more time to resolve, like waiting for parts, or customer response, or coordination with other teams. Alternatively, maybe agents are working on multiple tickets and not getting to these quickly enough.

But the fast cases (101, 103) have investigation to resolution times of 1 hour and 30 minutes respectively, suggesting that some issues can be resolved quickly.

So, perhaps the main factors causing delays are:
1. Escalations to Level-2 can introduce additional delays, especially if there's a long wait before Level-2 starts investigating (as in Case 105).
2. Some issues inherently take longer to resolve (as seen in Cases 102, 104, 105 where investigation to resolution is about 19 hours).

But in Case 105, the escalation process seems to be the main culprit for the extra delay (28 hours between escalation and investigation, compared to 2.5 hours in Case 102).

Perhaps Level-2 agents have longer response times, or escalated tickets aren't being prioritized properly. Maybe there's a bottleneck at the Level-2 team.

Another thing to look at is the time between assign and investigate. In Case 101, it's 40 minutes; in Case 103, it's 15 minutes; in Case 104, it's 3 hours 30 minutes; in Case 102, it's 2 hours 30 minutes to escalation, then another 2 hours 30 minutes to investigation; in Case 105, it's 10 minutes to first investigation, then 50 minutes to escalation, then 28 hours to next investigation.

So, the time between assignment and investigation can vary. In Case 104, it's 3.5 hours before investigation starts, which is longer than in the fast cases. Maybe agents are not starting investigations promptly.

Similarly, in Case 102, it's 2.5 hours from assignment to escalation, then another 2.5 hours to investigation. Maybe the Level-1 agent tried to investigate but then escalated, and it took time for Level-2 to pick it up.

In Case 105, the first investigation started quickly (10 minutes after assignment), but then it was escalated after 50 minutes of investigation, and then it took 28 hours for Level-2 to start investigating.

So, possible issues:
1. Delays in starting investigation after assignment (as in Case 104: 3.5 hours).
2. Delays in Level-2 picking up escalated tickets (as in Case 105: 28 hours vs. Case 102: 2.5 hours).
3. Long investigation to resolution times in some cases, possibly due to issue complexity or waiting for external factors.

Recommendations could include:
1. Monitoring the time between assignment and investigation start to ensure agents are starting work promptly.
2. Reviewing the escalation process to ensure Level-2 tickets are prioritized and picked up quickly.
3. Analyzing the types of issues that take long to resolve to see if additional resources or process changes can help.
4. Setting service level agreements (SLAs) for each step in the process to ensure timely handling.

But let's summarize the findings:

Significantly longer cases: Cases 102, 104, and 105 are above average, with Case 105 being the most extreme.

Root causes:
1. Escalations to Level-2 can cause delays, especially if there's a long wait before Level-2 starts investigating (as seen in Case 105).
2. Long investigation to resolution times in some cases (about 19 hours in Cases 102, 104, 105), possibly due to issue complexity or waiting for external factors.
3. Delays in starting investigation after assignment (as in Case 104).

Recommendations:
1. Improve the escalation process to ensure Level-2 agents start investigating escalated tickets promptly.
2. Investigate why some issues take longer to resolve and see if additional resources or process changes can help.
3. Monitor and reduce the time between assignment and investigation start.
4. Consider implementing SLAs for each step in the process to ensure timely handling.

But to be precise, the question asks to identify which cases have significantly longer resolution times. Looking at the numbers:

Average resolution time: ~20 hours
Case 101: 2.25 hours
Case 102: 25.17 hours
Case 103: 1.33 hours
Case 104: 24.17 hours
Case 105: 48.08 hours

Cases 102, 104, and 105 are above average. But "significantly longer" might mean more than, say, 24 hours (which is about 1 standard deviation above the mean, since SD is ~17.3 hours, and mean is 20.12, so mean + 1 SD is ~37.42 hours). But 24 hours is less than that.

Wait, mean is 20.12, SD is 17.3, so mean + 1 SD is ~37.42 hours. So cases above 37.42 hours would be more than 1 SD above mean. Only Case 105 is above that (at 48.08 hours).

But Case 102 and 104 are at ~25 hours, which is below mean + 1 SD. So statistically, only Case 105 is a significant outlier.

But in practical terms, Cases 102 and 104 are also taking much longer than the fast cases (which are around 1-2 hours). Maybe it's better to consider all cases above, say, 24 hours as significantly longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the average is skewed by the very long Case 105. If we exclude Case 105, the average of the other four cases is:

(135 + 1510 + 80 + 1450) / 4 = 3175 / 4 = 793.75 minutes  13.23 hours.

Then Case 105 is way above this, and Cases 102 and 104 are also above this new average (but not as extremely).

Given that, perhaps Cases 102, 104, and 105 are all significantly longer than the typical case.

But let's go with the original average including all cases, which is ~20 hours. Then cases above, say, 24 hours are significantly longer: Cases 102, 104, and 105.

But Case 105 is much longer than the others, so perhaps it's the main focus.

Now, what's causing the delays in these cases?

From the breakdown:
- Case 102: long investigation to resolution time (19 hours)
- Case 104: long investigation to resolution time (19 hours), and also a long assign to investigate time (3.5 hours)
- Case 105: very long escalation to investigation time (28 hours), plus long investigation to resolution time (19 hours)

So common factors in slow cases:
- Long investigation to resolution times (~19 hours)
- In some cases, long times between other steps (like escalation to investigation in Case 105, or assign to investigate in Case 104)

Potential root causes:
1. Some issues require more time to resolve (hence the 19-hour investigation to resolution time in slow cases).
2. Delays in the escalation process (as seen in Case 105 where it took 28 hours for Level-2 to start investigating after escalation).
3. Delays in starting investigation after assignment (as in Case 104 where it took 3.5 hours from assignment to investigation).

Recommendations:
1. Analyze the types of issues that lead to long investigation times and see if additional resources or training can help resolve them faster.
2. Improve the escalation process to ensure that Level-2 agents start investigating escalated tickets promptly.
3. Monitor the time between assignment and investigation start to ensure agents begin work on tickets promptly.
4. Consider setting and monitoring SLAs for each step in the process to identify and address bottlenecks.

So, the significantly longer cases are 102, 104, and 105, with 105 being the most extreme. The main factors causing delays are long investigation to resolution times, delays in escalation handling, and delays in starting investigations.
</think>

To identify which cases have significantly longer resolution times and determine the potential root causes, let's analyze the event log step by step.

First, we calculate the total resolution time for each case:

- **Case 101:** 2 hours 15 minutes
- **Case 102:** 25 hours 10 minutes
- **Case 103:** 1 hour 20 minutes
- **Case 104:** 24 hours 10 minutes
- **Case 105:** 48 hours 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the average resolution time:

- Total resolution time for all cases: 6060 minutes (101 hours)
- Average resolution time: 101 hours / 5 cases = 20.2 hours

Cases with significantly longer resolution times than the average (20.2 hours) are:
- Case 102: 25.17 hours
- Case 104: 24.17 hours
- Case 105: 48.08 hours

Among these, Case 105 is the most extreme outlier.

Now, let's identify the potential root causes of the delays:

1. **Long Investigation to Resolution Times:**
   - In Cases 102, 104, and 105, the time from investigation to resolution is approximately 19 hours. This suggests that certain types of issues may inherently take longer to resolve, possibly due to their complexity or the need for additional resources or information.

2. **Delays in Escalation Process:**
   - In Case 105, there is a significant delay (28 hours) between escalation to Level-2 and the start of the investigation by Level-2. This indicates potential inefficiencies in the escalation process or a lack of availability of Level-2 agents.

3. **Delays in Starting Investigation:**
   - In Case 104, there is a delay of 3 hours 30 minutes from assignment to the start of the investigation. This could indicate that agents are not starting investigations promptly, possibly due to workload or prioritization issues.

Based on these findings, here are some recommendations to address the performance bottlenecks:

1. **Improve Escalation Process:**
   - Ensure that escalated tickets are promptly assigned to Level-2 agents and that there is a clear process for prioritizing these tickets.

2. **Monitor Investigation Start Times:**
   - Implement monitoring to ensure that investigations start promptly after assignment. This could involve setting internal deadlines or alerts for agents.

3. **Analyze Issue Complexity:**
   - Analyze the types of issues that lead to long investigation times. Provide additional training or resources to agents to handle these issues more efficiently.

4. **Set Service Level Agreements (SLAs):**
   - Establish SLAs for each step in the process to ensure timely handling of tickets. Regularly review and adjust these SLAs based on performance data.

By addressing these factors, you can reduce the overall resolution time and improve the efficiency of your customer support process.

```markdown
| Case ID | Total Resolution Time | Significantly Longer Than Average? |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| 101     | 2 hours 15 minutes    | No                                 |
| 102     | 25 hours 10 minutes   | Yes                                |
| 103     | 1 hour 20 minutes     | No                                 |
| 104     | 24 hours 10 minutes   | Yes                                |
| 105     | 48 hours 5 minutes    | Yes                                |
```

**Potential Root Causes:**
1. Long investigation to resolution times in Cases 102, 104, and 105 (approximately 19 hours).
2. Delays in the escalation process, particularly in Case 105 where there was a 28-hour delay between escalation and investigation by Level-2.
3. Delays in starting investigations after assignment, as seen in Case 104 (3 hours 30 minutes).

**Recommendations:**
1. Improve the escalation process to ensure timely handling by Level-2 agents.
