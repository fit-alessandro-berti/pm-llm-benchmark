Here's a **Python dictionary** representing the **temporal profile** of the global supply chain process. It includes a **representative subset** of activity pairs, considering both **direct** and **indirect** (eventually following) activity relationships. The average times and standard deviations are estimated based on typical supply chain dynamics, with a focus on **realistic variability** and **complexity**.

### Notes:
- **Average times** are in **seconds** (as per the example).
- **Standard deviations** are also in **seconds**, reflecting **realistic variability** in supply chain operations.
- The **dictionary includes both direct and indirect relationships**, such as from `SS` to `AS`, which may be separated by multiple steps.
- The values are **estimates** and reflect **typical supply chain behavior** based on industry knowledge.

This profile can be used to detect **temporal deviations** in process executions using a given `ZETA` value.
