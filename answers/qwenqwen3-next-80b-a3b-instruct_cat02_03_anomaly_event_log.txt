Based on standard **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** best practices, the typical sequential flow is:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**   
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**   
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**   
4. **Receive Goods** (or services)   
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**   
6. **Match Invoice to PO** (3-way match: PO, Receipt, Invoice)   
7. **Release Payment**   
8. **Close Case**

This sequence ensures **internal controls**, **auditability**, and **financial integrity** — especially the principle that **payment should only occur after verification** that goods/services were ordered, received, and invoiced correctly.

Let’s analyze each case:

---

###  **Case 1001: Normal Flow**
- Requisition  Approve  Issue PO  Receive Goods  Invoice Received  Match Invoice  Release Payment  Close  
- **Perfectly aligned** with standard P2P.  
- **No anomaly.**

---

###  **Case 1002: Severe Anomaly — Payment Before PO Approval and Goods Receipt**

**Sequence:**
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. **Issue Purchase Order**  *No prior approval!*  
3. **Vendor Invoice Received**  
4. **Release Payment**  *Payment before PO approval, before receiving goods, before matching!*  
5. Approve Purchase Requisition  *Approval happens AFTER payment!*  
6. Receive Goods  *Goods received AFTER payment*  
7. Match Invoice to PO  
8. Close Case  

#### **Why this is problematic:**

- **Payment released BEFORE purchase order approval**: This violates **segregation of duties** and **authorization controls**. A PO should be formally approved before being issued — but here, the PO was issued, and **payment was made before the requisition was even approved**. This is a **major control failure**.
  
- **Payment released BEFORE goods received**: This exposes the organization to **fraud risk** — a vendor could invoice for goods never delivered, and the company pays anyway. The “3-way match” (PO, GR, Invoice) is bypassed entirely.

- **Invoice matching done AFTER payment**: Matching should precede payment to validate accuracy. Here, payment was released before matching — meaning there was **no verification** that the invoice matched the order or receipt.

- **Approval after payment**: Approving the requisition *after* payment suggests either **retroactive documentation** or **bypassing controls entirely**. This could indicate **fraud**, **workaround due to system limitations**, or **lack of process enforcement**.

>  **High-risk anomaly**: This case represents a **complete breakdown of internal controls**. It could lead to **overpayments, duplicate payments, fraud, or non-compliance with SOX or other financial regulations**.

###  **Case 1003: Anomaly — Payment Before Invoice and Goods Receipt**

**Sequence:**
1. Requisition  Approve  Issue PO  
2. **Release Payment**  *Payment before invoice received or goods received!*  
3. Vendor Invoice Received  
4. Receive Goods  
5. Match Invoice to PO  

#### **Why this is problematic:**

- **Payment released before receiving goods or invoice**: This is a **critical control failure**. Payment should never occur before the vendor invoice is received and matched to the PO and goods receipt.  
- **No 3-way match performed before payment**: The system (or user) paid without any verification that the goods were ordered, delivered, or invoiced correctly.  
- **Invoice and receipt occur after payment**: This suggests the payment was made **on estimate or assumption**, which is **not acceptable** in standard P2P. It increases risk of paying for non-delivered items or incorrect amounts.

>  **Moderate-to-high risk anomaly**: This indicates **poor process discipline** and **lack of automated controls**. It may reflect a manual override or a broken workflow system.

###  **Case 1004: Anomaly — Goods Received Before PO Issued**

**Sequence:**
1. Requisition  Approve  
2. **Receive Goods**  *Before PO issued!*  
3. **Issue Purchase Order**  *PO issued AFTER goods received!*  
4. Vendor Invoice Received  
5. Match Invoice to PO  
6. Release Payment  

#### **Why this is problematic:**

- **Goods received before PO is issued**: This means the organization received goods **without a formal purchase order**. This breaks the **“no purchase, no receipt”** control principle.  
- **No PO = no contractual terms, no agreed pricing, no approval trail**. The receiving department may have accepted goods based on verbal agreement — a **significant compliance and audit risk**.  
- **Matching invoice to PO becomes problematic**: If the PO was issued *after* receipt, the PO details (quantity, price, delivery date) may not match what was actually received. This could indicate **last-minute PO creation to justify payment**, potentially masking **unauthorized purchases** or **bypassing procurement policies**.

>  **Moderate risk anomaly**: This suggests **ad hoc purchasing** or **lack of integration between procurement and warehouse/receiving systems**. It may be common in small organizations but violates best practices in controlled environments.

##  Summary of Anomalies:

| Case ID | Anomaly Type | Risk Level | Explanation |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| **1002** | Payment before PO approval, before goods receipt, before matching; approval after payment |  **Critical** | Complete breakdown of P2P controls. High fraud and compliance risk. |
| **1003** | Payment before invoice and goods receipt |  **High** | Payment without verification. Violates 3-way match principle. |
| **1004** | Goods received before PO issued |  **Moderate** | Unauthorized receipt of goods; undermines procurement governance. |
| **1001** | — |  **Normal** | Fully compliant with P2P best practices. |

---

##  Recommendations:

1. **For Case 1002**: Investigate immediately. This may indicate **fraudulent activity**, **system misconfiguration**, or **deliberate control bypass**. Audit trail should be reviewed. Consider freezing payments for this vendor or user.
2. **For Case 1003 & 1004**: Implement **process automation** with **mandatory checkpoints**. Use ERP controls to prevent:
   - Issuing PO without approval
   - Receiving goods without PO
   - Paying before 3-way match
3. **General Improvement**: Enforce **system-enforced process flows** (e.g., workflow engines that block out-of-sequence activities) and conduct **regular P2P audits**.
4. **Training**: Ensure staff understand the **why** behind the sequence — not just the steps. For example, “Why can’t we pay before we get the invoice?” — because it’s a control against fraud.

---

##  Conclusion:

**Case 1002 is the most alarming**, representing a catastrophic failure of internal controls. Cases 1003 and 1004 indicate systemic weaknesses in process adherence. Only Case 1001 follows best practices. These anomalies suggest either **lack of system enforcement**, **manual workarounds**, or **intentional circumvention of controls** — all of which increase financial, operational, and compliance risk.
