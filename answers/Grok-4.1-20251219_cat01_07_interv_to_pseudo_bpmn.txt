### BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

#### **Participants (Swimlanes/Roles)**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk** (primary executor, logs invoices, matches, schedules payments)
- **Purchasing Officer** (confirms receipt and matches invoice to PO)
- **Department Manager** (provides final approval)
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor** (handles escalated exceptions)
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** (optional helper for supplier-related disputes)
- **Supplier** (external party, receives requests for corrections/revisions)

#### **Data Objects/Artifacts**
- Invoice (received via email)
- Purchase Order (PO) reference
- Goods Receipt Confirmation (implicitly provided by Purchasing)
- System Notification/Email (triggers approvals)

#### **Process Description**

**Start Event:** Invoice received (typically by email to Accounts Payable Clerk)

1. **Task: Check for valid PO number**  
   Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk  

   **Exclusive Gateway (Decision): Does invoice have a valid PO number?**  
   - **No** →  
     **Task: Request missing/corrected details from Supplier** (may involve Supplier Relationship Manager)  
     → Loop back to "Check for valid PO number" upon receipt of revised invoice  
   - **Yes** → Proceed  

2. **Task: Log invoice into accounting system**  
   Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk  

3. **Task: Forward invoice to Purchasing for confirmation**  
   Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk  

4. **Task: Verify receipt of goods/services and match invoice to PO**  
   Performed by: Purchasing Officer  
   (Compares quantities, prices, delivery charges)

   **Exclusive Gateway (Decision): Does invoice match PO and receipt confirmed?**  
   - **No (Discrepancy identified)** →  
     Sub-process: **Resolve Discrepancy**  
     - **Task: Contact Supplier or request corrected invoice** (may involve Supplier Relationship Manager for contract checks)  
     - If discrepancy cannot be resolved easily:  
       **Task: Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor**  
       Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk or Purchasing Officer  
       - Supervisor coordinates resolution (may create retrospective PO for non-PO invoices, contact supplier, or reject)  
     → After resolution: Loop back to "Verify receipt and match invoice to PO"  
   - **Yes** →  
     **Task: Send confirmation to Accounts Payable Clerk**  
     Performed by: Purchasing Officer  

5. **Task: Perform final system matching (3-way match: Invoice ↔ PO ↔ Receipt)**  
   Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk (after receiving confirmation)  

   (Note: Any remaining issues here would follow the same "Resolve Discrepancy" sub-process above)

6. **Task: System sends automatic approval request to Department Manager**  

7. **Task: Review and approve/reject invoice**  
   Performed by: Department Manager  
   (Reviews invoice, PO, confirmation; checks for budget alignment or suspicious items)

   **Exclusive Gateway (Decision): Manager approves?**  
   - **No** →  
     **Task: Reject or request further investigation**  
     → Route back to Accounts Payable Clerk → Enter "Resolve Discrepancy" sub-process (escalation possible)  
   - **Yes** → Proceed  

8. **Task: Schedule invoice for payment**  
   Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk  
   (Added to next payment cycle/run)

**End Event:** Invoice paid (or scheduled for payment)

#### **Additional Notes on Variations and Exceptions**
- **Non-PO Invoices:** Rare; handled via escalation to Supervisor who may create retrospective PO or reject outright.
- **Rework Loops:** Common at PO check, matching, and manager approval stages when issues arise.
- **Parallelism:** None explicitly mentioned; process is largely sequential with handoffs via email/system notifications.
- **Ambiguities Resolved:**  
  - Purchasing's role is primarily confirmation of receipt and initial matching; final system matching done by AP after confirmation.  
  - Supplier Relationship Manager is optional/ad-hoc participant for faster supplier coordination.  
  - Escalations to Supervisor occur when standard resolution paths fail.
