**Analysis and Findings:**

### 1. **Cases with Extended Durations:**
- **Case 2001:** Duration = 1.5 hours (fastest).
- **Case 2002:** Duration = 26 hours (1 day, 2 hours).
- **Case 2003:** Duration = 50 hours (2 days).
- **Case 2004:** Duration = 1.25 hours (fastest).
- **Case 2005:** Duration = 72 hours (3 days, 3 hours).

**Longest-Lasting Cases:**  
- **Case 2005 (High Complexity):** 72 hours (3 days).  
- **Case 2003 (High Complexity):** 50 hours (2 days).  
- **Case 2002 (Medium Complexity):** 26 hours (1 day) – also notable for unexpected delays compared to Low Complexity.

### 2. **Root Causes Analysis:**

#### **a. Complexity Level:**  
- **High Complexity Cases (2003, 2005):**  
  - Require **3+ additional document requests** (e.g., 2005 had three requests, 2003 had two).  
  - Longer approval cycles due to incomplete documentation (e.g., 2005 approved on April 4th after multiple delays).  
- **Medium Complexity (2002):**  
  - One documentation request caused a 26-hour delay, suggesting inefficiencies even for moderate complexity.  
- **Low Complexity (2001, 2004):**  
  - No documentation requests; claims resolved within hours.  

**Key Insight:** High Complexity claims inherently take longer due to repeated documentation needs, while Medium Complexity claims are inconsistently affected by delays.

#### **b. Resource Utilization:**  
- **Adjuster_Lisa** ( handling 2005 and 2002) and **Adjuster_Mike** (2003) frequently onboarded for documentation requests.  
- No clear bottleneck tied to specific resources, but repeated interaction with adjusters reflects systemic inefficiencies in tracking High Complexity cases.

#### **c. Region:**  
- No correlation between region (A or B) and delays. Both regions have High Complexity cases (A: 2003, B: 2005).

### 3. **Mitigation Recommendations:**

#### **For Complexity-Related Delays:**  
- **Automate Document Requests:** Use AI to flag missing information and auto-generate requests, reducing manual follow-ups.  
- **Dedicated High Complexity Teams:** Assign oversight for High Complexity claims to streamline approvals.  
- **Pre-Assessment Triage:** Classify claims upfront to prioritize-first workflows for High Complexity cases.

#### **For Medium Complexity Delays:**  
- **Standardize Medium Complexity Protocols:** Implement SLAs for documentation requests (e.g., resolve within 24 hours).  
- **Training:** Upskill staff on handling medium-complexity cases to mimic Low Complexity efficiency.

#### **General Improvements:**  
- **Real-Time Dashboards:** Monitor document request frequency and case age to flag bottlenecks immediately.  
- **Resource Redeployment:** Rotate overloaded resources (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa) during peak demand.

### **Final Answer:**

**Cases with Performance Issues:**  
1. **Case 2005** (72 hours)  
2. **Case 2003** (50 hours)  
3. **Case 2002** (26 hours)  

**Root Causes:**  
- **High Complexity** (2003, 2005) leads to excessive documentation requests and prolonged approvals.  
- **Inconsistent Handling of Medium Complexity** (2002) highlights gaps.  
- No Regional or Resource-specific bottlenecks observed.  

**Mitigation:**  
- Automate documentation for High Complexity claims.  
- Standardize Medium Complexity workflows.  
- Implement real-time monitoring to accelerate root-cause detection.  

**Key Takeaway:** Complexity is the dominant driver of delays. Mitigating High Complexity documentation overhead will have the largest impact on performance.
