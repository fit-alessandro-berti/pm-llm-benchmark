Okay, so I need to figure out which cases in the event log deviate from the normative process described. Let me start by understanding the normative process step by step.

The process starts with "Receive order." After that, it checks the inventory. If the inventory is sufficient, the next steps are to authorize payment, package items, ship the order, and then close it. If the inventory is insufficient, after checking, it should cancel the order and then close it. So, the two main paths are:

1. Inventory sufficient: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close
2. Inventory insufficient: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close

Now, looking at the event log, there are five cases. I'll go through each one to see if they follow these paths correctly.

Case 1: The activities are in the order Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. This looks correct because it follows the sufficient inventory path. All steps are in the right sequence, so no deviation here.

Case 2: The sequence is Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, after Check comes Package, but according to the normative process, after Check, it should be Authorize before Packaging. So here, Packaging happens before Authorizing payment. That's a violation because Authorize should come before Package. So Case 2 is deviating.

Case 3: The activities are Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. After Check, it Authorizes, then Cancels. But once it's canceled, the process should only go to Close, not proceed to Ship. Shipping after cancellation is incorrect. So this is a deviation.

Case 4: The sequence is Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. This is correct because it's the insufficient inventory path. Everything follows as expected.

Case 5: The activities are Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, after Authorize, it goes directly to Ship, skipping Package. The normative process requires that after Authorize, you must Package before Shipping. So Case 5 is deviating by skipping the Package step.

So, in summary, Cases 2, 3, and 5 have deviations. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Case 2: Packaging before Authorizing - wrong order.
Case 3: Shipping after Cancellation - shouldn't happen.
Case 5: Skipping Packaging - necessary step missing.

Yes, that seems right. Each of these cases violates specific steps outlined in the normative process.

**Answer:**

Upon analyzing the event log against the normative process description, the following cases deviate from the expected process flow:

1. **Case 2**:
   - **Violation**: The sequence of activities is "Receive order," "Check inventory," "Package items," "Authorize payment." 
   - **Explanation**: According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items." In this case, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which violates the specified order.

2. **Case 3**:
   - **Violation**: The sequence includes "Cancel order" followed by "Ship order."
   - **Explanation**: Once an order is canceled, the process should proceed directly to "Close order." The inclusion of "Ship order" after cancellation is a deviation from the normative process.

3. **Case 5**:
   - **Violation**: The sequence skips the "Package items" activity after "Authorize payment."
   - **Explanation**: The normative process specifies that "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order." Skipping "Package items" violates the expected workflow.

**Summary of Deviations**:
- **Case 2**: Incorrect order of activities.
- **Case 3**: Unauthorized activity after cancellation.
- **Case 5**: Missing required activity.
