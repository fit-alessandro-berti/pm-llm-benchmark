Based on the provided system log, I will transform the raw events into a process mining event log.

**Event Log:**

**Case Identification Logic:**
I grouped related events into coherent cases based on the sequence of application and document usage. A new case begins when the user switches to a new application or document and ends when the user switches back to a previously opened application or document. In this log, case 1 represents a logical unit of user work involving editing documents, sending an email, reviewing a report, and updating a budget.

**Activity Naming Logic:**
I translated raw low-level actions into higher-level process steps or standardized activity names. The following mapping was used:
- FOCUS: Start Editing Document
- SWITCH: Switch to [Application/Document]
- TYPING: Edit [Document]
- SAVE: Save [Document]
- CLOSE: Close [Document]
- CLICK: Open/Reply to Email
- SCROLL: Read Email
- HIGHLIGHT: Review Report
- TYPING with Keys: Update [Document/Report]
- CLICK with Action: Send Email

**Event Attributes:**
The following attributes were included:
- Case ID: A unique identifier for the case
- Activity Name: A descriptive name of the activity
- Timestamp: The original event timestamp
- Application/Document: The application or document involved in the activity

**Coherent Narrative:**
The final event log tells a story of user work sessions involving editing documents, sending an email, reviewing a report, and updating a budget. The user starts editing a document, switches to a new document, and continues editing. Then, the user switches to an email client, sends an email, and switches back to the report. After reviewing the report, the user switches to a budget and updates it. Finally, the user switches back to the document, inserts a reference, and saves the document. This narrative illustrates the user's workflow and helps identify process improvements.
