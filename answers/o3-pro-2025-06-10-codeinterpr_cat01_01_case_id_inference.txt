Below is one plausible reconstruction of the hidden case IDs.  
For clarity I label the reconstructed cases as

• Case A – “ER-45-M” (45-year-old male, Emergency Department)  
• Case B – “ER-62-F” (62-year-old female, Emergency Department)  
• Case C – “SURG-28-M” (28-year-old male, elective surgery)


CASE A(ER-45-M)

 1. 08:05:13  Register patient(Admin Clerk, ER)  
 4. 08:10:50  Initial triage(Nurse Joy, ER)  
 7. 08:15:42  X-ray imaging(Radiology Tech, Radiology)  
12. 08:23:10  Doctor consultation(Dr. Lee, ER) – diagnosis: hairline fracture  
15. 08:30:05  Patient discharged(Ward Clerk, ER)


CASE B(ER-62-F)

 2. 08:07:02  Register patient(Admin Clerk, ER)  
 5. 08:12:29  Initial triage(Nurse Mark, ER)  
 8. 08:16:10  Lab test requested(Dr. Smith, ER)  
10. 08:20:27  Lab test completed(Lab Technician, Laboratory)  
11. 08:22:54  Doctor consultation(Dr. Smith, ER) – diagnosis: minor infection  
14. 08:27:00  Prescription created(Dr. Smith, ER)  
17. 08:35:29  Patient discharged(Ward Clerk, ER)


CASE C(SURG-28-M)

 3. 08:07:15  Register patient(Admin Clerk, Surgery)  
 6. 08:13:00  Doctor consultation(Dr. Lee, Surgery) – scheduled knee surgery  
 9. 08:16:45  Surgery preparation(Surgical Nurse, Surgery)  
13. 08:25:19  Surgery performed(Dr. Lee, Surgery)  
16. 08:31:37  Recovery room(Recovery Nurse, Surgery)  
18. 08:40:13  Patient discharged(Ward Clerk, Surgery)


Why this grouping is logical
1. Unique patient attributes: age + gender (45 M, 62 F, 28 M) never change, so they serve as de-facto patient identifiers.
2. Activity flows: Each set forms a medically coherent pathway (ER  triage  diagnostics  consultation  discharge; elective surgery pathway from registration through OR to recovery and discharge).
3. Temporal consistency: Within each set, timestamps are strictly increasing; between sets they interleave, explaining the mixed event list.
4. Department alignment: ER events stay in ER/Radiology/Lab branches; Surgery events stay inside the surgical chain.

Thus the full 18-line log can be partitioned into the three cases shown above.
