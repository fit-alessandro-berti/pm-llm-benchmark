Looking at the log, two activities repeat within individual cases: **Verify Documents** and **Call Customer**.

For **Verify Documents**, the first occurrence is always the initial identity check, while the second happens after some corrective step—either after the customer uploads missing documents or after an account adjustment. That means the second verification is a *re-check* in light of new information, not just another pass at the same task.

For **Call Customer**, the first call is reactive—triggered by incomplete verification or a discrepancy—while the second is proactive, confirming that a change has been made. The shift from "outbound to clarify" to "follow-up to confirm" is meaningful.

Here's the log with the renamed activities:

The changes were driven by context: the first verification is a baseline check, the second is a re-verification after new information is provided; the first call is to resolve an issue, the second is to confirm a resolution.
