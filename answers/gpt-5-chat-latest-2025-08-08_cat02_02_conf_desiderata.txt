Alright — Let’s break your request down step-by-step.

## **Part 1 – Normative Rules Violations**

Here we look **only** at the “hard” rules — the strict sequence and conditional logic about when things can happen.

### **Case 1**
**Event Order:**
1. Application Received  
2. Credit Check  
3. Risk Assessment  
4. Loan Decision (Approved)  
5. Inform Applicant  
6. Finalize Documentation  
7. Close Case  

 **Rule Check:**  
- Follows the correct sequence.
- Credit Check before Risk Assessment.
- Risk Assessment before Loan Decision.
- Inform Applicant after Loan Decision.
- Loan Approved  Finalize Documentation before closing case.
- No skipped or reversed activities.  
** No normative violations.**

---

### **Case 2**
**Event Order:**
1. Application Received  
2. **Risk Assessment** *(before Credit Check —  violates ordering rule)*  
3. Credit Check  
4. Loan Decision (Rejected)  
5. **Finalize Documentation** *(after rejection —  violates conditional rule)*  
6. Close Case  

 **Issues:**
1. **Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check** – breaks the required rule:  
   > Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
2. **Finalize Documentation after Rejection** – strictly prohibited.

** Normative Violations:** Ordering error + prohibited finalization after rejection.

---

### **Case 3**
**Event Order:**
1. Application Received  
2. Credit Check *(more than 24h later — this is a *timing recommendation* violation, NOT normative)*  
3. Risk Assessment  
4. Loan Decision (Approved)  
5. Inform Applicant *(more than 48h later — timing recommendation violation)*  
6. Finalize Documentation  
7. Close Case  

 **Rule Check:**  
- Sequence preserved.
- Correct ordering.
- Approval case  finalization before closing case.
** No normative violations.**

** Normative Violations Summary Table**

| Case | Normative Violation? | Reason(s) |
|------|----------------------|-----------|
| 1    | No                   | Fully adheres to sequence and decision rules |
| 2    | Yes                  | (1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check; (2) Finalize Documentation after rejection |
| 3    | No                   | Correct sequence, only timing recommendations missed |

---

## **Part 2 – Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**

Here, violations are **suboptimal behavior**, but **not critical breaches**.

**Desiderata Rules Recap:**
- Credit Check within **24h** after Application Received.
- Inform Applicant within **48h** after Loan Decision.
- Optional Follow-up Call before Close Case.

---

### **Case 1**
- Credit Check within 30 minutes   meets recommendation.
- Inform Applicant within 2 hours of decision   meets recommendation.
- No Follow-up Call mentioned   desideratum missed (but not serious).  

---

### **Case 2**
- Credit Check performed after Risk Assessment — already a normative issue, but here for desiderata:
  - Credit Check at 09:00, Application at 08:00  within 1h   on timing.
- Inform Applicant timing: Not explicitly listed — appears missing entirely. *Given decision at 09:30 and no “Inform Applicant” — this is actually a normative omission (since informing is mandatory after decision)*, but you're explicit that it exists in normative step? Wait — in the log this item is missing entirely for Case 2. So:  
  - This is a **normative** issue (they didn't inform the applicant), not just desideratum. (I’ll flag in suggestions below.)

---

### **Case 3**
- Credit Check performed **~2 days (49h)** after Application   exceeds recommendation (desideratum fail).
- Inform Applicant done **~3 days (75h)** after decision   exceeds recommendation (desideratum fail).
- No Follow-up Call   recommendation missed.

---

** Desiderata Violation Summary Table**

| Case | Desiderata Violation? | Reason(s) |
|------|-----------------------|-----------|
| 1    | Minor                 | No follow-up call |
| 2    | Unclear timing issues; inform applicant missing (normative concern); else meets timing for credit check |
| 3    | Yes                   | Late credit check (>24h), late inform applicant (>48h), no follow-up call |

---

## **Part 3 – Interpretation / Justification Suggestions**

- **Case 1**: This is the ideal scenario — both normative and desiderata followed aside from the optional follow-up call. Shows process is capable of near-perfect execution.
- **Case 2**:  
  - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check** might indicate data-entry or logging errors, or a misunderstanding of process sequence. Possibly an urgent risk pre-screen was done before official credit pull.  
  - **Finalize Documentation after rejection** could stem from staff attempting to conclude paperwork for internal auditing, but conflicts with the normative rule.
  - **Missing “Inform Applicant”** is a key normative breach — maybe they assumed the decision announcement was part of another step.
- **Case 3**:  
  - Delays in Credit Check and informing the applicant may be due to workload constraints or holiday/weekend delays (application on Jan 12, credit check Jan 14).
  - Absence of follow-up call suggests this step is often skipped unless specifically required — organizational culture might not prioritize it if the decision is already communicated.

---

 **Final Answer:**

**1. Normative Violations:**
- **Case 2**:  
  - Risk Assessment before Credit Check (ordering violation)  
  - Finalize Documentation after Rejection (contradicts decision logic)  
  - Missing Inform Applicant step (normative omission)

**2. Desiderata Violations:**
- **Case 1**: Only follow-up call missing.  
- **Case 2**: No timing issue for credit check, but inform applicant missing (already a normative violation).  
- **Case 3**:  
  - Credit Check >24h after application.  
  - Inform Applicant >48h after decision.  
  - No follow-up call.

**3. Justifications/Interpretations:**
- Timing delays likely due to operational constraints or non-working days.  
- Out-of-order tasks might be data logging or procedural shortcuts for pre-screening.  
- Documentation after rejection may be internal record-keeping misunderstood as allowable.

If you want, I can now **draw a compliance heatmap** for the 3 cases showing green/yellow/red for each normative and desiderata criterion — so it’s visually obvious which cases are optimal.  
Would you like me to prepare that?
