1. **Identifying Cases Taking Longer:**
   The cases with significantly longer durations are:
   - Case ID 2002 (2024-04-01 09:45)
   - Case ID 2005 (2024-04-01 10:30)

2. **Analyzing Attributes to Determine Root Causes:**

   **Resource:**
   - Both cases have the resource "CSR_Paul" assigned, indicating that both are handled by a person with this role.
   - The high-complexity nature of these claims (Complexities: Medium) suggests additional documentation requests might be required.

**Region:**
- Case ID 2002 is located in Region B. This indicates that the region where it was submitted may have contributed to its longer duration as well, due to factors such as office location or physical constraints.
  
3. **Proposing Explanations and Suggested Mitigation Strategies:**

   - The high complexity of both cases suggests a need for more thorough evaluation processes at each step. This could include conducting additional risk assessments or having an external review panel assess the claims before final approval.
   
   - Given that all three case IDs have Resource "CSR_Paul" assigned, it is likely these are senior representatives handling the tasks involved in claim submission and processing. Ensuring they are properly trained on processes might reduce the time needed for completion.

By addressing resource assignments and possibly expanding validation checks or having additional review steps before final approval, the performance issues could be mitigated, leading to faster resolution times.
