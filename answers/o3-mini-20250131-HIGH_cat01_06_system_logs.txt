Below is one way to “elevate” the low‐level system log into an event log that tells a coherent story of separate work “cases” (in this example, work sessions on a specific document, email, PDF, or spreadsheet). In our solution we decided that a case is defined by the work on a single “item” (for example, editing Document1.docx or replying to an email) that starts when the application is brought into focus and ends when the item is closed (or the work moves on). In addition, we “translated” raw actions such as FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, SWITCH, CLICK, etc., into standardized, higher‐level activity names (for example, “Open Document” or “Compose Email”). One can see below how we grouped events:  

- **Case “Doc1”:** Editing Document1.docx. (The case starts when the user selects Document1, includes typing and saving (even if interrupted by switching away and back), and ends with the CLOSE event.)  
- **Case “Email_AnnualMeeting”:** Handling an email (the user opens the email client, opens an email about the Annual Meeting, scrolls through it, replies, types a reply, and finally sends it).  
- **Case “PDF_ReportDraft”:** Reviewing the PDF (the user switches to Adobe Acrobat to view Report_Draft.pdf, scrolls and highlights key findings).  
- **Case “Spreadsheet_Budget2024”:** Editing Budget_2024.xlsx (the user opens the spreadsheet, types updates and saves the changes).  
- **Case “Doc_QuarterlyReport”:** Editing Quarterly_Report.docx. (Even though there is an early FOCUS on Quarterly_Report at 08:59:50, the “active” editing session is marked by a later re‐focus, some typing and saving, and finally a CLOSE.)

Below is the final event log table with the three required attributes (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp). (Additional details such as the original application or document name could be added as extra attributes if desired.)

**Explanation of the Transformation Logic:**

1. **Case Identification:**  
   - We examined the sequence of events and grouped them by the “work item” (as suggested by the window title and application). For example, all events related to Document1.docx (from first FOCUS to CLOSE) were grouped into one case (Case ID “Doc1”), while the email-related events became their own case (Case ID “Email_AnnualMeeting”).  
   - Even though there is an early FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx (at 08:59:50), the “active” editing session is later (starting at 09:07:15) and ending with a CLOSE; we therefore grouped them into a single case (Case ID “Doc_QuarterlyReport”) to reflect the user’s overall intent with that document.

2. **Activity Naming:**  
   - We mapped raw action types into higher-level process steps. For instance, low‐level “FOCUS” events were translated into “Open Document” or “Open Spreadsheet” (and “Resume Document” when a document regained attention after working on another task).  
   - Similarly, “TYPING” events became “Edit Document” (or “Edit Spreadsheet”) and “SAVE” events became “Save Document” (or “Save Spreadsheet”).  
   - For email interactions, clicks and typing were combined into logical steps like “Open Email,” “Initiate Reply,” “Compose Email,” and “Send Email.”  
   - SWITCH events (when changing applications) were used to mark transitions between cases (for example, “Return to Document” when switching back to Document1).

3. **Event Attributes:**  
   - Each row in the table has a unique case identifier (e.g., “Doc1,” “Email_AnnualMeeting”) along with a standardized activity name and the original timestamp.  
   - This structure makes it compatible with standard process mining tools, which expect each event to be part of a case and to have an activity name and timestamp for ordering.

This transformed event log now tells a clear “story” of separate work sessions and is suitable for further analysis (e.g., discovering process models, performance analysis, or conformance checking) using standard process mining tools.
