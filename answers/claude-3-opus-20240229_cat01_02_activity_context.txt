Explanations for the name changes:

1. "Initiate Request" was renamed to reflect the channel used (portal or branch). This distinguishes if it was a digital or in-person initiation.

2. "Verify Documents" was renamed to specify if it was the initial verification, a re-verification after submission of additional docs (C001), or a re-verification after an account correction (C003). For C003, it's also noted that it was an in-person verification.

3. "Call Customer" was renamed in each instance to clarify the purpose of the call - requesting missing documents (C001), clarifying an account discrepancy (C002), confirming changes (C002), or calling the customer to return to the branch (C003).

4. "Submit Additional" was renamed to "Customer Submits Requested Docs" to be more specific.

5. "Adjust Account" was renamed to "Adjust Account Details Internally" (C002) and "Internal Account Correction" (C003) to clarify that these are internal adjustments without customer interaction.

The naming choices were based on the additional context provided for each event, indicating the purpose behind each activity at that point in the process. The goal was to make the activity names self-explanatory and reflective of their specific role in each case's workflow.
