The diagram is a BPMN-style process model for “Dispatch of goods” at a computer hardware shop.  It’s organized into three horizontal swimlanes—Secretary (in the shop), Warehouse, and Logistics—and shows in detail how a shipment is prepared, potentially insured, and handed off to a carrier.

1. Start and Parallel Branching  
   • The process begins with a “Ship goods” start event.  
   • An inclusive (or parallel) gateway immediately fans the flow into two concurrent branches:  
     – One branch stays with the Secretary, to decide on shipping method, insurance and carrier selection.  
     – The other goes down to the Warehouse, to package the goods.

2. Secretary Branch – Method, Insurance, and Carrier  
   a. Clarify shipment method  
      – The Secretary first “Clarify shipment method” (e.g. standard, express, special handling).  
      – A decision gateway (“Special handling?”) checks whether the order needs anything beyond usual packaging.  
   b. If special handling is required  
      – “Get 3 offers from logistic companies”  
      – “Select logistic company and place order”  
   c. If no special handling  
      – “Check if insurance is required” (using stored customer information)  
      – A decision splits again:  
         • If insurance is necessary, flow moves up into the Logistics lane to “Insure parcel.”  
         • In all cases the flow then proceeds to “Write package label.”  
   d. After either selecting a carrier or labeling the parcel (and insuring if needed), the two Secretary sub-paths re-merge at a synchronizing gateway.

3. Warehouse Branch – Packaging and Delay Notification  
   • “Package goods” is the warehouse task.  
   • A timer boundary event attached to that task specifies “48 hours”: if packaging isn’t completed within two days, the process takes an alternate path to “Notify customer about delay.”  
   • Once packaging is finished (with or without having sent a delay notice), this branch also arrives at the same merge gateway used by the Secretary branch.

4. Final Steps – Paperwork and Handover  
   • After both the Secretary’s preparations and the Warehouse’s packaging are done, a (parallel) join gateway leads to “Fill out Shipment paperwork.”  
   • Next, “Move package to pickup area.”  
   • Finally, the process ends with the “Shipment prepared” end event.

Key BPMN elements used:  
 • Start/end events (circles)  
 • Tasks (rounded rectangles) for each activity  
 • Exclusive/Inclusive gateways (diamonds) for branching on special handling, insurance needs, and synchronizing parallel paths  
 • A timer boundary event on the packaging task to handle delays  
 • Swimlanes to show responsibilities: Secretary handles all decision-making and carrier interactions; Warehouse does the physical packaging; Logistics handles insurance.
