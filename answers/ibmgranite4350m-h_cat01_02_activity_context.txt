To address this task effectively, we will follow a structured approach by first identifying repetitive activities within each case, then renaming them based on their context, and finally justifying these names to demonstrate our thought process.

### Step 1: Identifying Repetitive Activities

In the provided event log, several activities appear multiple times within the same case. These include:

- **Initiate Request**: This activity is repeated across different tickets in C001.
- **Verify Documents**: This recurring action appears for each ticket associated with this process step.

### Step 2: Renaming Activities Based on Context

Renaming these repetitive activities will help to clarify their roles within the process and highlight their unique contexts. Here's how we can modify them:

- **Initiate Request**:
  - C001 (Request Initiated)
  - C002 (Request Initiated)

These names indicate that each occurrence of this activity is part of a ticket in different stages or steps of the workflow.

- **Verify Documents**
  - C001
  - C002

This renaming reflects their role as verifying documents, which occurs at various stages within the process for these tickets. The context here refers to "verify" and its relevance to document verification across multiple cases.

### Step 3: Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities

After renaming the activities, our revised event log would look like this:

```json
{
  "Case ID": [
    {
      "Activity": "Request Initiated",
      "Timestamp": "2024-05-01 09:15:00",
      "Resource": "WebPortal",
      "Additional Context": "Customer submitted a request via online portal."
    },
    {
      "Activity": "Verify Documents",
      "Timestamp": "2024-05-01 09:20:00",
      "Resource": "BackOfficeAgent"
    },
    {
      "Activity": "Call Customer",
      "Timestamp": "2024-05-01 09:45:00",
      "Resource": "FrontlineAgent",
      "Additional Context": "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs."
    }
  ],
  "Case ID": [
    {
      "Activity": "Request Initiated",
      "Timestamp": "2024-05-02 08:05:00",
      "Resource": "WebPortal"
    },
    {
      "Activity": "Verify Documents",
      "Timestamp": "2024-05-02 08:15:00",
      "Resource": "BackOfficeAgent"
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

### Justification of Naming Choices

The naming choices for these activities were based on their role within the process:

- **Request Initiated**:
  - This activity corresponds to a ticket initiation where an initial request is submitted. It's important that this activity reflects its placement in the workflow as it pertains to creating or submitting new support tickets.

- **Verify Documents**
  - In this context, "verify" refers not just to document verification but also encompasses checking identities and verifying other aspects of customer information. Given the multi-ticket scenario (multiple cases), these activities likely represent checks on multiple parts of a transactional process.

The naming choices were justified by their role in clarifying the distinct phases within the support workflow, highlighting that each recurring activity is associated with its respective ticket's context, enhancing readability and understanding of the flow.
