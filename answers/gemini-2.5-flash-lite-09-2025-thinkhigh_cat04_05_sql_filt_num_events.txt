This task requires identifying which `case_id`s meet the count criteria (six or fewer events) and then retrieving all original event details for only those identified cases.

Here are two effective ways to achieve this in DuckDB SQL:

## Solution 1: Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) and JOIN (Recommended for clarity)

This approach explicitly separates the step of identifying qualifying cases from the step of selecting the final rows.

```sql
WITH QualifyingCases AS (
    -- Step 1: Identify all case_ids where the total count is 6 or less
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)
-- Step 2: Retrieve all events belonging only to the qualifying cases
SELECT
    e.*  -- Select all original columns from the event_log
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    QualifyingCases qc ON e.case_id = qc.case_id
ORDER BY
    e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

## Solution 2: Using a Window Function

This method calculates the total count per case directly onto every row using a window function, allowing filtering in the main `WHERE` clause.

```sql
SELECT
    t.*  -- Select all original columns
FROM
    event_log t
WHERE
    (
        -- Calculate the total count of events for the current case_id
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY t.case_id)
    ) <= 6
ORDER BY
    t.case_id, t.timestamp;
```
