### Step 1: Identifying Recurrent Activities and Their Contextual Meanings

The recurring activities identified from the log are:

- **Verify Documents:** Occurs first as an initial verification and later as a re-verification after additional documents or account adjustments.
- **Call Customer:** Occurs multiple times with differing purposes, including clarifying document issues, resolving discrepancies, updating customers, or inviting customers back to the branch.

### Step 2: Activity Renaming Based on Context

Each repeating occurrence is renamed to precisely reflect the context revealed in the process:

**Verify Documents:**
- Initial verification: **Initial Document Verification**
- Re-check after additional submission: **Document Re-Verification**

**Call Customer (per case context):**  
- C001:  
  - Purpose: Informing that verification is incomplete and needed additional documentation.  
    **Call to Request Additional Documents**

- C002:  
  - First occurrence to clarify discrepancy:  
    **Call for Account Clarification**
  - Second occurrence after internal account adjustment (to confirm resolution):  
    **Call to Confirm Account Adjustment**

- C003:  
  - Calling customer to return to branch:  
    **Call to Recall Customer to Branch**

### Step 4: Justification for Activity Renaming

- **Verify Documents** initially involves a standard check upon ticket initiation ("Initial Document Verification"). However, after submission of additional documents or internal account updates, its purpose shifts to confirming the newly provided or corrected information ("Document Re-Verification").

- **Call Customer** holds distinct purposes in each scenario:
  - In **C001**, the call explicitly concerned requesting missing documents.
  - In **C002**, two calls occurred: first to clarify a discrepancy identified during verification ("Call for Account Clarification"), and subsequently as a confirmation call after the internal resolution ("Call to Confirm Account Adjustment").
  - In **C003**, the customer was contacted explicitly to request their return to the branch ("Call to Recall Customer to Branch").

These renamed activities clearly disambiguate the workflow steps, removing ambiguity and clearly highlighting their roles and contextual positions within the process flow.
