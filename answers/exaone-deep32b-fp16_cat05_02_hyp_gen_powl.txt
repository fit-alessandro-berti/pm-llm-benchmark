Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the given POWL model and identify the anomalies as per the first task. Then, think about possible reasons why those anomalies exist, and finally come up with database queries to check for those issues.

Starting with the first part: identifying anomalies in the POWL model. Let me look at the code provided.

The process steps intended are R  A  E  P  N  C. But the actual model has some deviations. 

The loop is between E and P. The loop operator here (LOOP) with children E and P suggests that E and P can repeat in a cycle. So after E, you can do P, then go back to E again? Or maybe the loop allows E followed by P any number of times? Wait, the comment says "* (E, P) means: execute E (evaluate), then either exit the loop or execute P (approve) and then E again, repeatedly." Hmm, so the loop allows E followed by P, then E again, etc. So the loop can have multiple evaluations and approvals. That might be an anomaly because maybe the business rule requires that a claim is evaluated once, then approved once, but the loop allows multiple approvals or evaluations in a cycle. That's a possible anomaly.

Then there's an XOR between N (notify) and skip (silent transition). The XOR allows choosing either N or skip. So the customer notification can be skipped. The intended process includes N as a step, so skipping it would be an anomaly if notification is mandatory. So that's another anomaly: allowing the customer notification to be omitted.

The partial ordering in the StrictPartialOrder has some edges. The root has R  A  loop  xor  C. But the comments mention that they didn't enforce strict ordering between loop and xor to C. Also, there's an edge from A to C directly. The problem statement says that the partial ordering might allow closing the claim before evaluation or approval. Let me see:

The edges are:
- R comes before A
- A comes before loop
- loop comes before xor
- A also comes before C (so C can happen after A, but before loop and xor?)

Wait, the StrictPartialOrder's edges are added as:
root.order.add_edge(R, A)
root.order.add_edge(A, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
root.order.add_edge(A, C)

So the dependencies are that A must come after R, loop after A, xor after loop, and C can be after A. But since the order is a partial order, not a strict linear one, the path from A to C is allowed, but the loop and xor could be in parallel or in some other arrangement. 

The problem mentions that the partial ordering might allow closing the claim before proper evaluation or approval. For example, if after A (assign adjuster), the process can proceed to C (close) without going through the loop (E and P). Since there's an edge from A to C, that path is possible. So the claim could be closed immediately after assignment, skipping evaluation and approval. That's a major anomaly because closing before approval is not allowed in the intended process.

Another thing: the loop's structure. Since the loop is between E and P, maybe the process can loop multiple times, leading to multiple approvals. For instance, after E and P, it could loop again, so P could be executed multiple times. The intended process probably has approval once. So multiple approvals would be an anomaly here.

So compiling the anomalies:

1. **Loop between E and P allowing repeated evaluations and approvals**: The loop could cause the approval step (P) to be executed multiple times on the same claim, which might not be intended. For example, after evaluating and approving, it goes back to evaluate again, leading to another approval. So a claim could have multiple P events.

2. **XOR allowing skipping of customer notification (N)**: The XOR between N and skip means that the notification can be omitted. If the business rule requires notification, this is an anomaly.

3. **Premature closing (C) before evaluation/approval**: Because the partial order allows A to directly lead to C, the claim could be closed right after assignment without going through E and P. So a claim might be closed before any evaluation or approval steps.

4. **Possible concurrent execution of loop and other steps?** Not sure, but the partial order might allow some steps to happen out of sequence. For example, after the loop (E and P), the XOR (either N or skip) comes next, but the path to C could be after A, so maybe C can happen before the loop even completes? Wait, the loop is after A, so the loop has to come after A. But the edge from A to C allows C to be after A but before the loop? Wait, in a partial order, edges represent "must come after". So A must come before loop and before C. The loop must come before xor, and xor before C? Wait, the edge from loop to xor, and then xor to C? Wait, the code adds loop  xor, but there's no edge from xor to C. The root's order has nodes R, A, loop, xor, C. The edges are RA, Aloop, loopxor, and AC. So the path from A to C is direct, but the loop and xor are in another path. So the C can be after A, but the loop and xor are also after A. However, since it's a partial order, the process could take the path A  C, thus closing before the loop (E and P) even starts. That's a problem. So that's the third anomaly.

Now moving to the second part: generating hypotheses for why these anomalies exist.

Possible reasons:

1. **Loop between E and P**: Maybe the business process was changed to allow multiple evaluations (e.g., if the adjuster needs to re-evaluate after some condition), but the loop wasn't properly constrained. Or perhaps during a process redesign, they intended to have E followed by P once, but the modeler mistakenly used a loop. Alternatively, maybe there's a requirement that after approval, further evaluations can happen (like if new information comes in), but the model allows looping indefinitely unless there's a break, which might not be present. Technical error in the modeler's tool could have added the loop instead of a sequence.

2. **XOR allowing skipping N**: Maybe the notification is optional in some cases (e.g., if the customer is unreachable), but the model should have a condition. However, the XOR without any conditions allows it to be chosen arbitrarily, which might be a mistake. Perhaps the business rule was updated to sometimes skip notification, but the model didn't capture the conditions, leading to an XOR instead of a conditional choice. Or a miscommunication where the notification step was made optional but the model didn't enforce the conditions, leading to possible skips.

3. **Premature closing (C after A)**: The edge from A to C suggests that after assigning the adjuster, the claim can be closed. This might be due to a misunderstanding of the process flow. For example, maybe the assigner has the authority to close, but according to the intended process, closing must come after approval. Alternatively, a technical error where the modeler added an incorrect transition. Another possibility is that the process was modified to allow early closure under certain conditions (like a settlement before full approval), but the model didn't include the necessary constraints, leading to unrestricted closure.

Other possibilities could include:

- **Inadequate constraints in the process modeler's tool**: The tool might not enforce strict dependencies, so when creating the model, the user didn't properly set the orderings. For instance, the loop might have been intended as a sequence but was misconfigured as a loop.

- **Miscommunication between teams**: The process design team might have different interpretations. For example, the adjuster's assignment might sometimes lead to immediate closure in some scenarios, but the model didn't capture that correctly, leading to an unintended path.

- **Technical errors**: When building the model, perhaps the developer accidentally added the AC edge, thinking it was part of another path, but it introduced a shortcut.

Now, the third part: proposing database queries to check for these anomalies.

We need to look into the tables claims, adjusters, and claim_events. The claim_events table logs each step (activity) with a timestamp. The events would have the activity labels like 'R', 'A', 'E', 'P', 'N', 'C', etc. Also, the 'resource' field might indicate who performed it (like adjuster ID).

First anomaly: Claims closed without proper evaluation/approval. So a claim that has a 'C' event but no 'E' or 'P' events, or the 'C' comes before 'P' or 'E'?

Wait, according to the intended process, the order should be R  A  E  P  N  C. So closing (C) must come after P and N. But in the model, the path AC is allowed, so a claim could have C right after A. So in the events, if a claim has a C event before any E or P, that's a problem. Also, even if E and P exist but C comes before N, that's also a problem (since N should be before C). Wait the intended process has N before C, so if the model allows C without N (due to the XOR allowing skip?), then a claim that has C without N would be an instance of the XOR choosing to skip N. But the first anomaly (premature close) is about closing before evaluation/approval. So the first check is for claims where C occurs before E or P.

Second anomaly: Multiple approvals (P events). So any claim with more than one P event.

Third anomaly: Customer notification skipped (N not present in events, but the XOR allows that). So claims that have a C event but no N event. However, the XOR could also choose to do N, so this would count the cases where it was skipped.

Additionally, for the loop allowing multiple E and P: check if there are multiple P events (since each loop iteration would require E followed by P again). So even if there's one E and multiple Ps, that's an issue.

Let me outline the queries:

1. **Premature closure (C before E or P):**

Check for claims where the earliest C event is before the earliest E or P event. Or where there's a C event with no E or P events at all.

But how to structure this? Let's think in terms of event sequences.

For each claim_id:

- Find all events related to it, ordered by timestamp.

Check if there's a 'C' event that occurs before any 'E' or 'P' events. Or if there are no 'E' or 'P' events at all but there's a 'C'.

Alternatively, for a claim to be closed prematurely, the first occurrence of C must come before the first occurrence of E or P.

So the query could be:

SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
AND (
    -- No E or P events for this claim, or the first C is before first E/P
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events ce2 WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P')) = 0
    OR 
    (
        SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM (
            SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'E'
            UNION ALL
            SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'P'
        ) 
        > (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'C' LIMIT 1)
    )
)
GROUP BY claim_id
Hmm, maybe that's a bit complex. Alternatively, for each claim, check if the earliest C is before the earliest E or P.

Alternatively, using window functions:

WITH events AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        activity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) as rn,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id) as first_e,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id) as first_p,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id) as first_c
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P', 'C')
)
SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
FROM events
WHERE 
    (first_e IS NULL AND first_p IS NULL AND first_c IS NOT NULL) 
    OR 
    (first_c < first_e OR first_c < first_p)
    -- Wait, but if first_e or first_p is later than first_c, then that's the case.
    -- So the condition is first_c < first_e_or_p, where first_e_or_p is the minimum of first_e and first_p.

Hmm, perhaps better to compute the earliest of E and P for each claim, then compare to C's earliest.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

SELECT claim_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) as first_c,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity IN ('E', 'P') THEN timestamp END) as first_ep,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P', 'C')) as total_epc
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
    HAVING 
        (first_ep IS NULL AND first_c IS NOT NULL) 
        OR 
        (first_c < first_ep)
) AS sub
WHERE total_epc >=1 OR first_c IS NOT NULL;

Wait, but maybe the first_ep could be null if there are no E or P events. So the first part (first_ep is null and first_c exists) would mean that there's a C but no E/P. The second part (first_c < first_ep) would be when C is before the first E or P. So combining those gives the claims where C occurs before E/P or without them.

This would capture the premature closure.

2. **Multiple approvals (multiple P events):**

SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) as p_count
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'P'
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

3. **Customer notification skipped (C exists without N):**

Check if a claim has a C event but no N event.

SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events ce2 
    WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    LIMIT 1
    = 0
)

Alternatively:

SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'C'
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN 1 END) = 0;

4. **Loop causing multiple E and P cycles (multiple P events, which is covered in point 2, but also check for E followed by P multiple times). For example, if there are multiple E and P in sequence. But the main indicator would be multiple P events. So the second query covers that.

Another possible check for the loop: the presence of E followed by P followed by E again, creating a loop. But that's more complex. The count of P events being more than one would be sufficient for the anomaly of multiple approvals.

Additionally, checking for claims that have both E and P multiple times. But the first anomaly (loop) is already captured by the multiple P events.

Other possible checks: For the XOR allowing skip, the third query covers that.

Another possible anomaly from the loop: the process could have E followed by P multiple times. So even if there's one E and multiple Ps, that's a problem. So the second query (count P >1) would catch that.

Now, for the XOR allowing skipping N, the third query would find all claims that have C but no N. But maybe the process allows skipping N in some cases, but the model's anomaly is that it's possible when it shouldn't be. So if the business rule requires N, then those are anomalies.

Additionally, maybe check how often N is skipped. The third query gives the count.

Another possible check for the loop: check if there are instances where after P, another E occurs. Because the loop allows E again after P. So for a claim, after a P, there's an E again. To detect that:

SELECT claim_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        activity,
        LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('P', 'E')
) AS t
WHERE prev_activity = 'P' AND activity = 'E'
GROUP BY claim_id
Hmm, but this would find any occurrence where E comes after P. Which is allowed in the loop. But the problem is that the loop allows this, so maybe that's intentional in the model but an anomaly in the business process. Since the question states that the loop is an anomaly, then any occurrence of E after P would be part of that loop's anomaly. However, the presence of multiple Ps is already covered. Alternatively, the loop allows E followed by P any number of times, so the existence of multiple Ps is the main indicator.

So the queries I need to propose are:

1. Premature closure (C before E/P or without E/P):

SELECT claim_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) as first_c,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity IN ('E', 'P') THEN timestamp END) as first_ep,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events ce2 WHERE ce2.claim_id = claim_id AND activity IN ('E', 'P')) as ep_count
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
    HAVING 
        (first_ep IS NULL AND first_c IS NOT NULL) 
        OR 
        (first_c < first_ep)
) AS premature_claims
GROUP BY claim_id;

But maybe a more efficient way using EXISTS:

SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
    AND (
        -- Either no E or P events at all
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events ce2 WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity IN ('E', 'P') ) = 0
        OR
        -- The first C is before the first E or P
        (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM claim_events ce2 WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity IN ('E', 'P')) > 
        (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM claim_events ce2 WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'C')
    )
)

This might be better.

2. Multiple approvals (count P >1):

SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) as p_count
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'P'
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

3. Skipped notifications (C exists without N):

SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'N') = 0
GROUP BY c.claim_id;

4. Also, check for the loop's E followed by P multiple times. But maybe that's covered by the multiple P's. Alternatively, check if there are any E events after P events for the same claim. But that's part of the loop's allowed behavior in the model, but an anomaly in the business process. Since the question says the loop is an anomaly, then any occurrence of E after P would be part of that. However, the main indicator is multiple P's. So perhaps the first three queries are sufficient.

Another possible check: claims that have both E and P but the C comes before N. Since the intended process requires N before C. Wait, the intended process is RAEPNC. So C must come after N. If the model allows the XOR to choose N or skip, but the intended process requires N, then any C without N is an anomaly (covered by query 3). Also, if N is present but C comes before N, that's also a problem. Wait, the XOR allows choosing between N and skip. So if they choose N, then C must come after N. But in the model's partial order, after the XOR (which is after the loop), then where does C come in? The root's order has xor followed by C? Wait the code's root has nodes R, A, loop, xor, C. The edges are loop  xor, but there's no edge from xor to C. The edge from A to C is present. So the path could be A  C, bypassing the loop and xor. Alternatively, the path could be A  loop  xor  C. But the xor's children are N and skip. So after xor, how does C come? The xor is part of the path leading to C? Maybe the model's structure allows the xor to be followed by C. But the code's StrictPartialOrder may not have that edge. Hmm, perhaps the model's structure allows C to be after xor, but the code's edges don't enforce that. This is getting a bit complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the intended process requires N before C, so any claim that has a C event before an N event (if N is present) would be an anomaly. But if the XOR allows skipping N, then C can come after the skip. So the problem is when N is required but skipped. The third query already checks for C without N. If N is present but C is before N, that would be another issue. Wait, according to the intended flow, N must come before C. So even if N is done, but C is before N, that's a problem. So perhaps another query to check for C occurring before N when N exists.

So adding a fourth query:

4. C occurs before N when N is present:

SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) as first_n,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) as first_c,
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('N', 'C')
    GROUP BY claim_id
    HAVING first_c < first_n
) AS invalid_order;

This would find claims where C is before N, which violates the intended order.

But according to the model's XOR, after the loop (E and P), you choose between N or skip. If you choose N, then the next step would be C? Or is there another step? The model's structure may allow C to come after the XOR. So the path would be loop  xor (choosing N)  then C. So in that case, N would be before C. But if the model's partial order allows C to be after A, then maybe the path could be A  C without going through the loop and xor. But if the path goes through the loop and xor (choosing N), then C should come after. However, if the model's structure allows C to be placed anywhere after A, then even after N, C could be placed before N? Not sure. The partial order may not enforce the sequence between xor and C. 

This is getting a bit too into the model's structure. Since the problem states that the model has anomalies, the queries should target the anomalies as per the problem description. The user mentioned that the XOR may omit customer notification, so the third query covers that. The premature closure is covered by the first query. The multiple approvals by the second. The C before N (if N is present) would be another, but maybe that's part of the XOR's anomaly. However, the problem's example for the XOR anomaly is the omission of N, so perhaps the third query is sufficient.

So compiling the proposed queries:

1. Premature closure (C before E/P or without E/P):

SELECT claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
) AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events ce2 
    WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P') 
) = 0 
   OR 
   (
       SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM claim_events ce2 
       WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P')
   ) > (
       SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM claim_events ce2 
       WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C'
   )
GROUP BY c.claim_id;

Alternatively, using a CTE for clarity.

2. Multiple approvals (count P >1):

SELECT claim_id 
FROM claim_events 
WHERE activity = 'P' 
GROUP BY claim_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

3. Skipped notifications (C exists without N):

SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'C' 
AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'N') = 0;

4. (Optional) C before N when N exists:

SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id, 
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) as first_n,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) as first_c
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('N', 'C')
    GROUP BY claim_id
    HAVING first_c < first_n
) AS t;

But maybe the problem considers the XOR's skip as the main issue, so the third query is sufficient for that anomaly.

Additionally, checking for the loop's effect (multiple E and P cycles), but the second query on P counts covers that.

Another possible check for the loop: check if there are any E events after P events for the same claim. Because the loop allows E after P. So:

SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id, 
           activity,
           LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P')
) t
WHERE prev_activity = 'P' AND activity = 'E';

This would find instances where E comes after P, indicating a loop iteration. If the business process shouldn't allow that, then these are anomalies. But since the problem states the loop is an anomaly, this would be part of that. However, the count of multiple P's (query 2) might be sufficient as an indicator.

In summary, the main queries to propose are the first three.
</thought>

### 1. Identified Anomalies in the POWL Model:
- **Loop Between Evaluation (E) and Approval (P):**  
  The loop allows repeated execution of E followed by P, enabling multiple approvals (P) for a single claim, which violates the intended single approval step.  
- **XOR Skipping Customer Notification (N):**  
  The XOR between N and a silent transition permits omitting the mandatory customer notification step.  
- **Premature Claim Closure (C):**  
  The partial order allows closing (C) immediately after assigning an adjuster (A), bypassing evaluation (E) and approval (P).  

---

### 2. Hypotheses for Anomaly Causes:
- **Loop Anomaly (E-P Cycle):**  
  *Technical Error:* The loop might have been intended as a sequence (E  P once) but misconfigured as a loop.  
  *Business Misalignment:* A requirement for iterative evaluations (e.g., post-approval revisions) was poorly modeled without constraints.  

- **XOR Skipping Notification:**  
  *Miscommunication:* Notification might be optional in some edge cases (e.g., urgent closures), but the model lacks conditions to enforce this, leading to arbitrary skips.  
  *Tool Limitation:* The process modeling tool might have forced an XOR instead of a conditional gateway.  

- **Premature Closure:**  
  *Incorrect Dependencies:* The edge `A  C` might have been added erroneously, assuming adjusters can close claims without approval.  
  *Rush Deployment:* Process designers prioritized speed over rigor, omitting constraints during a tight deadline.  

---

### 3. Database Queries to Detect Anomalies:

#### **1. Premature Closure (C before E/P or without E/P):**  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce 
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
) AND (
    -- No E/P events, or C occurs before first E/P
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events ce2 
     WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P')) = 0 
    OR 
    (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM claim_events ce2 
     WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P')) 
    > (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM claim_events ce2 
        WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C')
);
```

#### **2. Multiple Approvals (>1 P events):**  
```sql
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) AS p_count
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'P'
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

#### **3. Skipped Customer Notification (C without N):**  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'C' 
  AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events 
       WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'N') = 0;
```

#### **4. C Occurs Before N (if N Exists):**  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS first_n,
           MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS first_c
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('N', 'C')
    GROUP BY claim_id
    HAVING first_c < first_n
) AS invalid_order;
```

---

**Notes:**  
- The first three queries target the primary anomalies. The fourth checks for an additional violation of the intended NC order.  
- Results from these queries can validate hypotheses (e.g., frequent premature closures would indicate poor process constraints).
