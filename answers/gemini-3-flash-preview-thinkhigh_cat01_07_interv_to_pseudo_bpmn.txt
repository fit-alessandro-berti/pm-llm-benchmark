This textual BPMN model describes the **Invoice Approval and Payment Process** based on the provided interview transcripts.

### **1. Participants & Roles (Pools and Lanes)**
*   **Supplier (External):** Provides invoices and missing information.
*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk (Mary):** Primary process owner; logs, matches, and schedules payment.
*   **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Verifies goods/services receipt and PO accuracy.
*   **Department Manager (Carlos):** Final budget/operational approval.
*   **AP Supervisor (Rita):** Handles complex exceptions and retrospective POs.
*   **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Resolves pricing or contract discrepancies.

### **2. Process Activities & Sequence Flow**

#### **Phase 1: Receipt and Initial Validation**
1.  **Start Event:** Invoice received (typically via email).
2.  **Task (Mary):** Check for valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
3.  **Gateway (Is PO present?):**
    *   **If No PO:**
        *   **Sub-path A (Standard):** Mary sends invoice back to Supplier to request details.
        *   **Sub-path B (Informal Services):** Mary escalates to **Rita (AP Supervisor)**. Rita works with Dept Heads to create a retrospective PO or reject the invoice. (Return to "Log Invoice" once PO is created).
    *   **If PO is present:** Proceed to **Log Invoice**.
4.  **Task (Mary):** Log invoice into the accounting system.

#### **Phase 2: Purchasing Verification**
5.  **Task (Mary):** Forward invoice to Purchasing Department.
6.  **Task (Dan):** Compare invoice quantities, prices, and delivery charges against the PO.
7.  **Gateway (Do details match PO?):**
    *   **If Discrepancy Found:**
        *   **Task (Dan/Mary):** Contact Supplier for correction OR Hold invoice.
        *   **Optional Task (Karen):** If pricing is disputed, Karen verifies against the supplier contract and advises AP/Purchasing.
        *   **Escalation (If unresolved):** Mary escalates to **Rita (AP Supervisor)** to coordinate between departments.
    *   **If Details Match:** Proceed to **Confirm Receipt**.
8.  **Task (Dan):** Send confirmation email to Accounts Payable.

#### **Phase 3: Matching and Managerial Approval**
9.  **Task (Mary):** Match invoice line items against the PO in the system.
10. **Gateway (System Match Successful?):**
    *   **If No (Discrepancy):** Loop back to **Escalation/Clarification** with Purchasing or Supervisor.
    *   **If Yes:** System automatically triggers an approval request to the Department Manager.
11. **Task (Carlos):** Review invoice, PO, and confirmation in the system.
12. **Gateway (Manager Approval?):**
    *   **If Reject/Hold:** Carlos notifies Mary to investigate suspicious amounts or unbudgeted items. (Process loops back to Mary for investigation).
    *   **If Approved:** Carlos hits "Approve" in the system.

#### **Phase 4: Payment**
13. **Task (Mary):** Receive approval notification and schedule invoice for the next payment cycle.
14. **End Event:** Invoice Paid/Processed.

### **3. Exceptions and Variations**

*   **Missing PO (Early Phase):** While Mary usually rejects these immediately, Dan (Purchasing) sometimes identifies a missing PO later and sends it back to Mary to restart the validation.
*   **Informal Contracts:** Rita (Supervisor) manages a specific "re-work loop" where a PO is created *after* the invoice is received to allow the process to continue.
*   **Pricing Discrepancies:** This triggers an ad-hoc collaboration between Dan, Mary, and Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager) to verify contract terms before the invoice can move to the matching phase.
*   **Escalation Loop:** If at any point Mary or Dan cannot resolve a discrepancy (missing info/wrong price), the flow is interrupted and moved to Rita (Supervisor) until "cleared," at which point it re-enters the normal flow at the "Confirmation" or "Matching" step.

### **4. Key Artifacts**
*   **Invoice:** The primary document moving through the flow.
*   **Purchase Order (PO):** Required for system logging and matching.
*   **Confirmation Email:** Sent by Dan to trigger the next phase.
*   **System Notification:** Automated trigger for Carlos (Dept Manager).
*   **Supplier Contract:** Reference tool used by Karen for price disputes.
