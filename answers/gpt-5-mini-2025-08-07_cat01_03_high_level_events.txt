Below I propose a set of high-level process steps that aggregate the lowlevel events in your sample log, show how the lowlevel events map into those steps for cases A1 and B2, and explain the rationale and simple rules you can apply to the rest of the log.

Summary of proposed high-level steps (ordered)
- 1) Material Reception & Identification
- 2) Placement & Positioning
- 3) Preheat / Thermal Prep
- 4) Welding / Joining
- 5) Weld Quality Check
- 6) Coating Application & Drying
- 7) Final Visual Inspection

For each high-level step below I give: (A) which low-level activities are included, (B) typical resources, (C) example mapping for Case A1 (and B2), and (D) rationale / grouping rules.

1) Material Reception & Identification
- Included low-level activities:
  - Retrieve raw metal sheet
  - Scan barcode
- Typical resources:
  - Operators (e.g., Operator A)
- Example (A1):
  - 2024-03-01 08:00:05 Retrieve raw metal sheet (Operator A)
  - 2024-03-01 08:00:07 Scan barcode (Operator A)
- Rationale:
  - These events are logically the start of processing a new item: physical retrieval + identification. They are temporally adjacent and performed by the same resource type (operator). Grouping them emphasizes the "item acquisition/ID" stage.

2) Placement & Positioning
- Included low-level activities:
  - Place metal sheet on table
  - Align metal sheet
- Typical resources:
  - Operators and positioning systems / robot arms (Operator A, Robot Arm #2)
- Example (A1):
  - 2024-03-01 08:00:10 Place metal sheet on table (Operator A)
  - 2024-03-01 08:00:15 Align metal sheet (Robot Arm #2)
- Rationale:
  - These actions together constitute preparing the item in the work area and ensuring correct geometry. They are close in time and logically follow the reception/ID step.

3) Preheat / Thermal Preparation
- Included low-level activities:
  - Preheat metal sheet
- Typical resources:
  - Heating units (Heating Unit #1)
- Example (A1):
  - 2024-03-01 08:00:20 Preheat metal sheet (Heating Unit #1)
- Rationale:
  - Thermal preparation is a distinct phase often required before joining. It is separate from mechanical positioning and typically performed by different equipment, so it forms its own high-level step.

4) Welding / Joining
- Included low-level activities:
  - Pick up welding tool
  - Weld corner A
  - Weld corner B
- Typical resources:
  - Operators, welders, welding tools
- Example (A1):
  - 2024-03-01 08:01:00 Pick up welding tool (Operator B)
  - 2024-03-01 08:01:05 Weld corner A (Operator B)
  - 2024-03-01 08:01:10 Weld corner B (Operator B)
- Rationale:
  - Picking up the tool and the subsequent weld actions form one cohesive assembly/joining stage. They are tightly sequenced and performed by the same resource (Operator B) and share intent (create welds).

5) Weld Quality Check
- Included low-level activities:
  - Measure weld integrity (quality sensor)
- Typical resources:
  - Quality sensors, QA devices (Quality Sensor #1)
- Example (A1):
  - 2024-03-01 08:01:20 Measure weld integrity (Quality Sensor #1) — IntegrityScore: 95
- Rationale:
  - QA immediately after welding is a clear phase: different resource (sensor) and different function (verification vs. production). It’s meaningful to report separately because it can cause rework or stop the flow.

6) Coating Application & Drying
- Included low-level activities:
  - Apply protective coating
  - Dry coating
- Typical resources:
  - Coating units, heating/drying units (Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2)
- Example (A1):
  - 2024-03-01 08:01:30 Apply protective coating (Coating Unit #3)
  - 2024-03-01 08:01:45 Dry coating (Heating Unit #2)
- Rationale:
  - Coating and drying form a multi-step finishing stage. They are logically grouped because they share purpose (surface protection/finish) and often are sequential and proximate in time.

7) Final Visual Inspection
- Included low-level activities:
  - Visual check
- Typical resources:
  - Operators performing final QA (Operator C)
- Example (A1):
  - 2024-03-01 08:02:00 Visual check (Operator C) — Check: Passed
- Rationale:
  - Final inspection is typically the last step to accept/release the item. It’s a distinct QA activity by human operator and should be reported separately.

Aggregated mapping for provided cases (start/end timestamps)
- Case A1
  - Material Reception & Identification: 08:00:05–08:00:07
  - Placement & Positioning: 08:00:10–08:00:15
  - Preheat / Thermal Prep: 08:00:20–08:00:20
  - Welding / Joining: 08:01:00–08:01:10
  - Weld Quality Check: 08:01:20–08:01:20
  - Coating Application & Drying: 08:01:30–08:01:45
  - Final Visual Inspection: 08:02:00–08:02:00

- Case B2 (same mapping, slightly different timestamps)
  - Material Reception & Identification: 08:00:05–08:00:08
  - Placement & Positioning: 08:00:12–08:00:18
  - Preheat / Thermal Prep: 08:00:25–08:00:25
  - Welding / Joining: 08:01:03–08:01:12
  - Weld Quality Check: 08:01:22–08:01:22
  - Coating Application & Drying: 08:01:35–08:01:50
  - Final Visual Inspection: 08:02:05–08:02:05

General grouping rules you can apply to the full log
- Lexical mapping: maintain a dictionary that maps common low-level activities to high-level labels (e.g., "Retrieve..." + "Scan..." -> Material Reception & Identification).
- Temporal adjacency: treat events within a short time window as part of the same stage. In this sample a few seconds–a couple minutes is expected; you can tune threshold (e.g., gap > X minutes implies new stage).
- Resource-type boundaries: a change from operator to machine (or from production resource to QA resource) often indicates a stage boundary.
- Logical sequences: recognize canonical sequences (retrieve -> place -> align -> preheat -> weld -> QA -> coat -> dry -> final inspect) and use them to disambiguate.
- Atomic vs composite: group short repeated actions that are sub-steps of a larger intent (e.g., two weld actions are a single "Welding" step).
- QA split: treat measurement/inspection events as distinct high-level QA steps whenever they follow a production activity.

Suggestions for representation in your process model or output dataset
- For each case, emit one record per high-level step with:
  - CaseID, HighLevelStepName, StartTimestamp (first low-level event), EndTimestamp (last low-level event), ResourcesInvolved (set), ConstituentActivities (list of low-level activities), KeyMetrics (e.g., measured IntegrityScore if present).
- Keep the low-level event IDs or timestamps so you can drill down from any high-level step to the raw events for audit or rework.

Why this grouping improves understanding
- Reduces noise from highly granular logs while preserving process phases.
- Makes it easier to measure stage durations, bottlenecks, and resource utilization.
- Separates production (assembly) from QA and finishing, which supports quality and throughput analytics.

If you’d like, I can:
- Produce a programmatic mapping (rules/dictionary) you can apply to the entire log (e.g., pseudo-code or regex-based mapper), or
- Apply this aggregation to a larger sample of your log and return the aggregated event table.
