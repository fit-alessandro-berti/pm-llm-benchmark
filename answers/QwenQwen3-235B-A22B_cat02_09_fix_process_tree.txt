<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a process tree for a Procure-to-Pay process that's underfitting, meaning it allows too much flexibility. My job is to fix it so that it enforces the correct sequence.

First, I need to understand the original structure. The current model starts with Create Requisition and Approve Requisition in sequence. Then there's a parallel block (AND operator) containing Create PO, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match Invoice, and Pay Invoice. Finally, Close Case comes after that. 

The problem here is the parallel block. Because in reality, some of these steps need to happen in a specific order. For example, you can't pay the invoice before receiving it. Similarly, creating the PO should come before receiving goods or the invoice. The parallel block allows all these activities to happen in any order, which is bad. So I need to restructure that part.

Let me list the correct order again:

1. Create Purchase Requisition
2. Approve Purchase Requisition
3. Create Purchase Order
4. Receive Goods
5. Receive Invoice
6. Match Invoice to PO
7. Pay Invoice
8. Close Case

So after approving the requisition, the Create PO must come next. Then, Receive Goods and Receive Invoice can happen in parallel? Wait, in some cases, goods might arrive before the invoice, or vice versa. But maybe they need to both be completed before moving on. However, the next step after them is Match Invoice to PO, which requires both the goods received and the invoice received, right? Because matching would involve checking that the invoice matches the PO and the goods received. So yes, Receive Goods and Receive Invoice should be done in parallel, but both must complete before proceeding. Then after that, you can Match, then Pay, then Close.

Wait, but the correct order in the prompt lists Receive Goods then Receive Invoice then Match. But perhaps in practice, the invoice can come before goods? Hmm, but if the process requires that you can't pay until both goods and invoice are received and matched. So maybe after creating PO, you have to Receive Goods and Receive Invoice in parallel. Then, once both are done, you can proceed to match the invoice to the PO. Then Pay Invoice and Close Case.

So the steps after Create PO should be a parallel block (AND) for Receive Goods and Receive Invoice. Then, a sequence where you Match, then Pay, then Close Case. Wait, but Close Case should come after Pay, right?

Wait the original sequence is Create PO, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match, Pay, Close. But according to the intended order, after Create PO, you have to do Receive Goods, then Receive Invoice, then Match, etc. Wait, the initial list says steps 4-7 are sequential. Or perhaps Receive Goods and Receive Invoice can be in any order? Like, you can receive the goods first or the invoice first. But the steps 4 and 5 in the prompt's list are Receive Goods then Receive Invoice, but maybe in reality, the order could vary. However, according to the prompt, the intended logic is that these steps are in that order. Wait, the prompt says the process is intended to follow the standard logic as listed, which is strictly sequential. So steps 4 and 5 are sequential. But that might not be the case in real processes. Hmm, but according to the problem statement, the intended order is the list provided, so steps 4-7 must be sequential. Wait, no. Let me check again.

The prompt lists the intended order as:

1. Create Requisition
2. Approve
3. Create PO
4. Receive Goods
5. Receive Invoice
6. Match Invoice to PO
7. Pay Invoice
8. Close Case

So according to that list, steps 4 and 5 are sequential. So Receive Goods comes before Receive Invoice. But in reality, sometimes the invoice may arrive before the goods. However, the problem says that the intended logic is this order. Therefore, the model must enforce that sequence. Wait, but maybe the problem allows for the invoice to come before goods? The problem says "domain-appropriate order". So maybe the intended process allows for some parallel steps. Wait, the original model's problem is that the parallel block allows all of create_po, receive goods, etc., which is incorrect. But the correct model should have a strict sequence.

Wait, according to the intended order, after approving the requisition, you create a PO. Then you have to receive goods, then receive invoice, then match, then pay. But that seems like all steps are sequential. But in reality, after creating the PO, the supplier ships goods and sends an invoice. But you can't receive the invoice until after the supplier sends it, which might be after shipping goods. But regardless, the process requires that the Receive Goods and Receive Invoice are done in some order. However, the matching step requires that both have been done. So perhaps the Receive Goods and Receive Invoice can be done in parallel (either order), then you proceed. But according to the problem's intended order, step 4 is Receive Goods, step 5 Receive Invoice. So maybe they should be sequential. But that's a bit unclear.

But according to the original list, they are in sequence. So perhaps the intended model requires that Receive Goods occurs before Receive Invoice. Therefore, the steps after Create PO should be a sequence: Receive Goods, then Receive Invoice, then Match, then Pay, then Close.

But wait, in the current model, the parallel block allows all those steps (Create PO, Receive Goods, etc.) to be in any order, which is bad. The first error is that Create PO is in the parallel block. That can't be. Create PO must come after Approve Requisition, and before anything else. So in the original model, the parallel block includes Create PO. So according to the current model, after Approve Requisition, you can do Create PO, Receive Goods, etc., in parallel. Which is impossible. Because Create PO must be the first step after approval, and then after that, you might have some parallel steps. Wait, the original model's structure is:

Sequence:

Create Req -> Approve Req -> (Parallel: Create PO, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match, Pay) -> Close Case.

But that's wrong because Create PO should be the first step after approval. But in this model, all the activities in the parallel block can be done in any order. So the model allows someone to Pay Invoice before Create PO, which is invalid.

Ah, this is a major problem. The current model's parallel block includes Create PO. So the model allows for creating the PO in parallel with Approving the requisition? No, no. The sequence is Create Req -> Approve Req -> Parallel block. So the Parallel block comes after Approve Req. But in the parallel block, Create PO is a child. So that would mean that Create PO must be executed (as part of the parallel block), but in parallel with the other steps. So after Approve Req, all of Create PO, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, etc., can happen in any order. Which is invalid because Create PO must come first. Then after PO creation, you can have receiving goods and invoice, etc.

So the first mistake in the current model is that Create PO is inside the parallel block. Which allows creating the PO in parallel with receiving goods or invoice, which is impossible. Also, you can't have Pay Invoice in parallel with other steps. So the main issues are:

- Create PO should be a sequence step after Approve Req. Not in the parallel block.

- The parallel block allows any order of the remaining steps, which allows paying before receiving invoice, etc.

So the corrected model should have:

Approve Req -> Create PO -> Then, a possible parallel block for Receive Goods and Receive Invoice (assuming both must be completed), then a sequence of Match Invoice, Pay Invoice, Close Case.

Wait, but according to the intended order, after Create PO, you must Receive Goods, then Receive Invoice. If that's the case, then those two should be sequential. But in some domains, you might receive the invoice before goods. So perhaps the process allows either order. If that's the case, then a XOR choice between receiving goods first or invoice first, followed by the other. But more likely, both must be completed, regardless of order. So an AND block (parallel) for Receive Goods and Receive Invoice, then proceed to Match, Pay, Close.

So the corrected process tree would be:

Sequence:

Create Requisition -> Approve -> Create PO -> (AND: Receive Goods and Receive Invoice) -> Match Invoice to PO -> Pay Invoice -> Close Case.

But wait, in the intended sequence listed in the prompt, the steps 4-5 are sequential. So perhaps the model should enforce that. However, the prompt says that the process "is intended to follow this standard logic" which lists the steps in that order. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to have a sequence Create PO followed by Receive Goods followed by Receive Invoice, then Match, etc. But that would not allow the invoice to come before goods. But according to the problem's intended logic, that's not allowed.

Alternatively, if the problem allows the invoice and goods to be received in any order, then the model should use a parallel block. But according to the problem's list, they are in sequence, so maybe the model should enforce that.

Hmm. Let me re-read the prompt. The intended order is:

3. Create PO

4. Receive Goods

5. Receive Invoice

6. Match

7. Pay

So according to this list, steps 4 and 5 are sequential. So Receive Goods must be followed by Receive Invoice. Therefore, the correct model should have a sequence here.

But in reality, sometimes the invoice might arrive before the goods. However, according to the problem's intended process, the order must be enforced. Therefore, the process tree must have a sequence starting with Create PO, then Receive Goods, then Receive Invoice, then Match, etc. However, this may not be the best approach, but according to the problem statement, the intended order is strictly as listed.

In that case, the corrected model should be a sequence of all the steps after the Approve.

Wait, the problem says "retain all the same activities but enforce a sequence and structure that only allows the normal, domain-appropriate order of events."

So the correct model should be a straight sequence: Create Requisition, Approve, Create PO, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match, Pay, Close.

But that would be a simple sequence. But in the current model, after Approve, there's a parallel block. So changing that block into a sequence would add to the overall sequence.

Wait, the current root is a sequence with children [Create Req, Approve Req, parallel_block, Close Case]. So the problem is that the parallel_block allows steps to happen in any order. But if we replace the parallel_block with a sequence_block containing Create PO followed by Receive Goods, then Receive Invoice, then Match, then Pay, then that would make the entire root a sequence.

But then that would fix the order. However, the question says that the current model underfits, perhaps allowing too much behavior. So the fixed model should have a more restrictive structure.

But wait, the original intended order is all sequential. So the correct process tree should be a single sequence. However, there are some cases where certain steps can be done in different orders, but according to the prompt, the intended logic is strictly sequential.

In that case, the corrected model would be a sequence:

CreateReq -> Approve -> CreatePO -> ReceiveGoods -> ReceiveInvoice -> Match -> Pay -> Close.

But in the current model, CreatePO is inside the parallel block, which allows it to be done in parallel with other steps, which is invalid. So first, CreatePO must be in sequence after Approve.

So the first step is to restructure the process tree as follows:

After Approve Requisition:

CreatePO must be next.

Then, Receive Goods must be next.

Then, Receive Invoice.

Then, Match Invoice.

Then Pay Invoice.

Finally, Close Case.

So all steps are sequential.

But that would make the entire process a sequence of all the activities, which would be the strictest way.

In that case, the parallel block should be replaced by a sequence block that includes CreatePO, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match, Pay.

Wait, but CreatePO is supposed to be after Approve. The current model's structure is:

root = sequence (create req, approve req, parallel_block, close case).

So the parallel_block is between approve req and close case.

But the corrected model should have:

sequence: create req -> approve req -> create po (sequence) -> receive goods (sequence) -> receive invoice (sequence) -> match -> pay invoice, then close case.

Wait, no. The entire process tree should be a sequence of all the steps in order.

So:

root = sequence([CreateReq, ApproveReq, CreatePO, ReceiveGoods, ReceiveInvoice, MatchInvoice, PayInvoice, CloseCase])

But the original model's structure had the parallel_block in between Approve and Close, which allowed a lot of flexibility.

So the main issues in the current model are:

- CreatePO is in a parallel block, allowing it to be executed in any order with the other steps. It should come immediately after ApproveReq.

- ReceiveGoods and ReceiveInvoice are in a parallel block, which would allow them to be done in any order, but according to the intended order, they should be sequential.

Wait, according to the intended list, ReceiveGoods comes first, then ReceiveInvoice. So the sequence is important here.

- MatchInvoice must come after both ReceiveInvoice and ReceiveGoods. If the current model allows Match to happen before either, that's a problem.

- PayInvoice must come after MatchInvoice.

- CloseCase must be last.

So the corrected model should have a sequence structure that enforces all steps in order.

Therefore, the corrected process tree should be a single sequence containing all activities in the specified order.

So the fixed model's root would be a sequence:

CreateReq -> ApproveReq -> CreatePO -> ReceiveGoods -> ReceiveInvoice -> MatchInvoice -> PayInvoice -> CloseCase.

But wait, the original current model's parallel block includes CreatePO, ReceiveGoods, etc. So in the current model, after ApproveReq, all activities in the parallel block must be executed, but in any order. Which is wrong because CreatePO could be done after Paying, which is impossible.

So the solution is to replace the parallel_block with a sequence block that includes CreatePO, ReceiveGoods, ReceiveInvoice, MatchInvoice, PayInvoice.

Wait, yes. The corrected code would be:

root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req, 
    approve_req, 
    ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
        create_po,
        receive_goods,
        receive_invoice,
        match_invoice,
        pay_invoice
    ]),
    close_case
])

Wait, but Close Case should be after Pay Invoice. So the entire structure is a sequence:

CreateReq -> ApproveReq -> (CreatePO -> ReceiveGoods -> ReceiveInvoice -> MatchInvoice -> PayInvoice) -> CloseCase.

Yes. That way, all steps are sequential.

But wait, what if the Close Case can only be done after Paying. In this model, that's enforced.

But according to the problem's intended process, Close Case is step 8. So yes.

In this case, the model would enforce that all steps are done in sequence. Therefore, the process tree would not allow any parallel execution. But the problem says that the current model underfits (i.e., allows more behaviors than allowed), but maybe the intended model is more restrictive. However, in some cases, certain steps could be optional (but according to the problem's list, all steps are required).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows some flexibility where ReceiveGoods and ReceiveInvoice can be swapped. If that's allowed in the domain, then the model should have a XOR between two sequences: one Goods first, Invoice next, and another Invoice first, Goods next. But the problem says that the intended logic is the order listed. Therefore, the model should enforce that exact order. So the steps after CreatePO must be ReceiveGoods, then ReceiveInvoice, then MatchInvoice, etc.

In this case, the corrected model should be a full sequence.

So the original model's error is that it allows all those steps in parallel, allowing any order. The fix is to enforce the exact sequence.

But wait, another thing: the original list's step 3 is Create PO, then step 4 is Receive Goods. So Create PO must be followed by Receive Goods, which must be followed by Receive Invoice, and so on.

So the process tree should have a sequence operator from Create PO to Receive Goods, etc.

So the corrected code would replace the parallel block with a sequence block that includes all those activities in the correct order.

Wait, in the current code:

parallel_block = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[create_po, receive_goods, receive_invoice, match_invoice, pay_invoice])

root = SEQUENCE([create_req, approve_req, parallel_block, close_case])

Therefore, the steps after approve_req are the parallel_block. The parallel_block requires that all its children are executed in some order (since in an AND block, all children must be executed, in any order), then close_case.

But the children of the parallel_block include create_po, which should be the first step. So the model allows create_po to be executed at any time within the parallel_block's execution. But logically, create_po should be the first step after approve_req.

Thus, the corrected model should have a sequence after approve_req:

ApproveReq -> CreatePO, then a block that handles ReceiveGoods, ReceiveInvoice, Match, Pay, and CloseCase in a structure that enforces their order.

Wait, no. CloseCase should be the last step. The root's sequence includes close_case after the parallel_block. So in the original model, after the parallel_block completes, CloseCase is executed.

But the parallel_block includes PayInvoice, so CloseCase would come after PayInvoice.

But in the intended order, CloseCase is after PayInvoice, which is correct.

But the problem is that in the current model, PayInvoice can happen before CreatePO, which is wrong.

So the corrected model should have a sequence:

CreateReq -> ApproveReq -> CreatePO -> (sequence: ReceiveGoods -> ReceiveInvoice -> MatchInvoice -> PayInvoice) -> CloseCase.

In other words, the entire process is a sequence of all steps.

So the code would look like:

root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,
    approve_req,
    create_po,
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice,
    close_case
])

Wait, but in the original model, the close_case is a sibling of the parallel_block in the initial sequence. So in the original model, the sequence is:

CreateReq -> ApproveReq -> parallel_block -> CloseCase.

Which means that after executing all elements of the parallel_block, you must execute CloseCase.

But in the corrected model, CloseCase should be after PayInvoice, but in the current structure, it's a separate step. However, according to the intended order, CloseCase is the last step, which would be after PayInvoice.

So in the corrected model, the entire process tree should be a single sequence of all eight steps: CreateReq, ApproveReq, CreatePO, ReceiveGoods, ReceiveInvoice, MatchInvoice, PayInvoice, CloseCase.

But wait, that would require that all eight steps are executed in that exact order. Which aligns with the problem's intended logic.

But the problem says "retain all the same activities but enforce a sequence and structure that only allows the normal, domain-appropriate order of events". So if the normal order is a strict sequence, then this is the correct approach.

But what about the possibility that after creating the purchase order, you might have some other concurrency? For example, receiving goods and receiving invoice can be done in parallel. The intended logic lists them as sequential steps. But according to the problem's list, step 4 is Receive Goods, step 5 is Receive Invoice. So they should be sequential.

Therefore, the corrected model should be a single sequence of all eight steps.

But in the current model, the close_case is a separate step after the parallel_block. So in the original code, CloseCase is the 4th child of the root's SEQUENCE. So the current model's root has four children: create_req, approve_req, parallel_block, close_case.

Ah, that's a problem. Because CloseCase is after the parallel_block in the sequence. The parallel_block is supposed to include CreatePO, ReceiveGoods, etc. So according to the current model, after the parallel_block completes, you must do CloseCase. But CloseCase would be the last step, which is correct. But the problem is the internal structure of the parallel_block.

Wait, in the current model, the sequence of the root is:

CreateReq -> ApproveReq -> (parallel_block) -> CloseCase.

But the parallel_block includes CreatePO, ReceiveGoods, ReceiveInvoice, MatchInvoice, PayInvoice.

But CloseCase is after the parallel_block in the sequence, so after executing all the elements of the parallel_block, you must execute CloseCase.

But according to the intended process, CloseCase should be after PayInvoice. Which in the current model's structure, that's the case, because PayInvoice is in the parallel_block, and CloseCase is after that.

But the problem is that the parallel_block requires that all of its children are executed (in any order), then CloseCase. So CloseCase would be executed after all those steps. However, the model allows CloseCase to be executed after all steps in the parallel_block, which is okay. But the main problem is that the steps inside the parallel_block can be done in any order.

So in the original model:

After ApproveReq, you must create_req, then approve_req, then in the parallel_block, you must execute all the five activities in any order, then CloseCase.

But that's wrong because CreatePO must be the first activity in that block. However, the model allows someone to do PayInvoice first, then CreatePO, which is impossible.

So the main fix is to restructure the parallel_block into a structure that requires CreatePO to be executed first, then ReceiveGoods and ReceiveInvoice (sequentially?), then MatchInvoice, then PayInvoice.

But how to structure this.

The correct order after ApproveReq:

CreatePO must be executed.

ReceiveGoods must be executed after CreatePO.

ReceiveInvoice must be executed after ReceiveGoods.

MatchInvoice must be after ReceiveInvoice.

PayInvoice after Match.

CloseCase after Pay.

But according to the intended list, yes. So the entire process is a single sequence.

So the corrected model should have all activities in a sequence.

But in the original code's structure, the root's children are create_req, approve_req, parallel_block, close_case. So the close_case is separate. Therefore, the corrected model would replace the parallel_block with a sequence that contains create_po, receive_goods, receive_invoice, match_invoice, pay_invoice. Then close_case comes after.

So the root is a sequence of:

create_req,

approve_req,

(sequence: create_po, receive_goods, receive_invoice, match_invoice, pay_invoice),

close_case.

Which would result in the following order:

create_req -> approve_req -> create_po -> receive_goods -> receive_invoice -> match_invoice -> pay_invoice -> close_case.

Exactly the desired sequence.

So the error in the original model was that the parallel_block allowed all steps after approve_req to be executed in any order. By replacing the parallel_block (AND) with a sequence_block (SEQ), we enforce that create_po comes first, then receive_goods, etc.

Additionally, the original parallel_block included create_po. Which was a major error. Now, create_po is the first in the sequence.

Now, the corrected process tree would enforce the correct order.

Now, to write this in code:

The fixed code would have a sequence_block inside the root's sequence:

parallel_block in the original code is replaced with a sequence_block.

In code:

# Define activities (same as before)

# Corrected model:
sequence_block = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_po,
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice
])

root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[create_req, approve_req, sequence_block, close_case])

Wait, but close_case is already a ProcessTree node (since you created it as a node with label). Wait in the original code:

close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

In the current model, the root's children are create_req, approve_req, parallel_block, close_case. So close_case is a child after the parallel_block.

In the corrected model, the root's children are create_req, approve_req, sequence_block, close_case.

Which would make the entire sequence:

CreateReq -> Approve -> CreatePO -> ReceiveGoods -> ReceiveInvoice -> Match -> Pay -> CloseCase.

Yes. This should fix all issues.

Now, the explanation:

The original model allowed any order for CreatePO, ReceiveGoods, ReceiveInvoice, MatchInvoice, PayInvoice. This could result in paying before creating a PO, or receiving goods after paying, etc. The corrected model uses a sequence block after Approve Requisition, enforcing that CreatePO is done first, followed by ReceiveGoods, then ReceiveInvoice, then MatchInvoice, then PayInvoice. CloseCase is last. This ensures that all steps are executed in the intended strict sequence, preventing any invalid order.
</think>

###  **Step 1: Identify Issues in the Current Model**

The current process tree model underfits the intended behavior of the "Procure-to-Pay" process. The key issues are:

- **Incorrect nesting of `Create_Purchase_Order`**: It is placed inside a `PARALLEL` block, allowing it to occur in any order relative to other activities. This violates the business rule that a purchase order must be created **after** requisition approval and **before** receiving goods or an invoice.

- **Unrestricted parallelism of critical activities**: The `PARALLEL` block allows `Receive_Goods`, `Receive_Invoice`, `Match_Invoice_to_PO`, and `Pay_Invoice` to occur in **any order**, which can lead to invalid behavior such as:
  - Paying an invoice **before** receiving it.
  - Matching an invoice **before** receiving both the goods and the invoice.
  - Receiving goods **after** paying the invoice.

- **Lack of enforcement of domain logic**: The model does not reflect the standard, domain-appropriate sequence of events:
  ```
  Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  Create PO  Receive Goods  Receive Invoice  Match Invoice to PO  Pay Invoice  Close Case
  ```

---

###  **Step 2: Corrected Process Tree Model**

The corrected model enforces the intended sequential order of all activities. It replaces the `PARALLEL` block with a `SEQUENCE` block to ensure strict ordering. The `Close_Case` activity is placed at the end of the sequence to ensure that the process is only closed **after** payment has been made.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Define activities
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Corrected structure: all activities in strict sequence
sequence_block = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_po,
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice
])

# Root of the process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,
    approve_req,
    sequence_block,
    close_case
])
```

---

###  **Step 3: Explanation of the Corrected Model**

The corrected model ensures **strict sequential execution** of all process steps, aligning with the standard "Procure-to-Pay" logic:

1. **Create Requisition**  **Approve Requisition**  **Create Purchase Order**  
   - These must occur in strict sequence. A purchase order cannot be created before the requisition is approved.

2. **Create Purchase Order**  **Receive Goods**  
   - Goods cannot be received before the purchase order is created.

3. **Receive Goods**  **Receive Invoice**  
   - In the intended process, the invoice is typically received **after** goods are received.

4. **Receive Invoice**  **Match Invoice to PO**  
   - Matching requires both the invoice and the purchase order to be available.

5. **Match Invoice to PO**  **Pay Invoice**  
   - Payment must be based on a valid match between the invoice and the purchase order.

6. **Pay Invoice**  **Close Case**  
   - The process is only closed after the invoice is paid.

This structure **prevents all invalid behaviors** that were possible in the original model, such as:

- Paying before receiving goods or an invoice.
- Matching an invoice without having both the goods and the invoice.
- Creating a purchase order after receiving goods or an invoice.

---

###  **Conclusion**

The corrected process tree model enforces the **domain-appropriate sequence** of the "Procure-to-Pay" process by replacing the `PARALLEL` block with a `SEQUENCE` block. This ensures that all activities are executed in the intended order, eliminating any possibility of invalid or premature execution of critical steps. The model is now **overfitting** (i.e., it only allows the intended behavior), which is the desired outcome for process conformance verification.
