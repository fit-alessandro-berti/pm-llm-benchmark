Okay, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user wants to exclude certain cases from the event_log based on specific sequence and timing conditions. 

First, I need to identify cases where the three activities occur in direct succession. Direct succession means no other activities in between. So for a case_id, the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' must appear consecutively. 

To find sequences in SQL, window functions like LEAD can be useful. LEAD allows looking at the next rows without changing the order. So for each event in a case, check if the next two activities match the required sequence.

Next, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' must be more than 5 days. So after identifying the sequence, I need to calculate the timestamp difference between these two events.

Once those cases are identified, the final query should exclude all events from those cases. So the main approach is to first find the case_ids that meet both conditions, then select all events not in those case_ids.

Let me structure this into parts:

1. Identify case_ids with the exact sequence.
2. Among those, check if the time difference exceeds 5 days.
3. Use a subquery or CTE to get those case_ids and exclude them from the main select.

For part 1, using LEAD to check the next two activities for each row. For example, if current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then next should be 'Create Order', and the one after that should be 'Confirm Order'. Also, ensure all three are part of the same case_id.

But wait, using LEAD might miss sequences that start at different positions. For example, if the sequence starts at the second event in the case. So we need to check every possible triplet in order within each case.

Alternatively, assign a row number per case ordered by timestamp, then self-join to get the next two events. But that could be complex.

Another approach: For each case_id, order events by timestamp, then for each row, check if activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and the next two are as required. Using LEAD with offset 1 and 2.

So something like:

SELECT case_id
FROM (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
    LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
    LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_order_time,
    LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time
  FROM event_log
) 
WHERE 
  activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
  AND next_activity = 'Create Order' 
  AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND DATEDIFF('day', create_order_time, confirm_order_time) > 5

This would capture any case where at least one occurrence of this sequence exists. But wait, this would only check triplets starting with 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. If there are multiple sequences in a case, but at least one meets the time condition, then that case should be excluded.

But how to handle cases where there are multiple such triplets? For example, a case might have two sequences where one meets the time condition and another doesn't. But according to the problem statement, we need to exclude cases where any such sequence exists with time >5 days.

So even if one occurrence in a case meets both conditions, the entire case should be excluded.

Once we have these case_ids, we can exclude them from the main query.

Putting it all together:

WITH excluded_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
      LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
      LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_order_time,
      LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time
    FROM event_log
  ) sub
  WHERE 
    activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
    AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND DATEDIFF('day', create_order_time, confirm_order_time) > 5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases);

Wait but this might not capture all possible sequences because it only checks triplets starting at each 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. For example, if a sequence starts at a different position but still has those three activities consecutively. However, given that we're partitioning by case_id and ordering by timestamp, each row is processed in order. So any occurrence of 'Approve...' followed by 'Create...' and 'Confirm...' in consecutive rows would be captured here.

But what if there are other activities before or after? Like if a case has events: A, B, C where A is Approve..., B is Create..., C is Confirm... Then yes. But if there's a longer sequence like A, B, C with other activities in between? No—because LEAD(1) would skip over any intermediate activities. Wait no: If between A and B there's another activity X in between, then A's next_activity would be X instead of B. So this approach correctly checks for consecutive events.

Therefore this should work for detecting consecutive sequences.

Another consideration: The same case could have multiple sequences meeting criteria. Using DISTINCT ensures we don't get duplicates in excluded_cases.

Testing this logic: For each row where activity is Approve..., check if next two are Create and Confirm. If yes and time diff >5 days include that case in exclusion list.

Then select all events not in excluded cases.

This seems correct.

To solve this problem using DuckDB SQL, we need to identify and exclude cases that meet specific event sequence and timing criteria from an `event_log` table. Here's how to approach it step-by-step:

---

### **Step 1: Identify Cases with the Required Sequence**
First, detect `case_id` values where three consecutive events occur in this exact order:
1. `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`
2. `'Create Order'`
3. `'Confirm Order'`

**Key Tools**:
- **Window Functions**: Use `LEAD()` to check subsequent rows within each `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp`.
- **Date Difference**: Calculate elapsed time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` using `DATEDIFF`.

```sql
WITH excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        sub.case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            -- Check next two activities in sequence
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER w AS next_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_activity,
            -- Capture timestamps for time calculation
            LEAD(timestamp::DATE, 1) OVER w AS create_order_date,
            LEAD(timestamp::DATE, 2) OVER w AS confirm_order_date
        FROM
            event_log
        WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)
    ) sub
    WHERE
        sub.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND sub.next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND sub.next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        -- Filter for cases exceeding 5 days between steps 2-3
        AND DATEDIFF('day', create_order_date::DATE, confirm_order_date::DATE) > 5
)
```

---

### **Step 2: Exclude Matching Cases**
Return all events **except** those from cases identified above:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE
    case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases);
```

---

### **Final Query**
Combine these steps into a single query:
```sql
WITH excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        sub.case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER w AS next_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp::DATE, 1) OVER w AS create_order_date,
            LEAD(timestamp::DATE, 2) OVER w AS confirm_order_date
        FROM
            event_log
        WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)
    ) sub
    WHERE
        sub.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND sub.next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND sub.next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND DATEDIFF('day', create_order_date::DATE, confirm_order_date::DATE) > 5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE 
    case_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM excluded_cases);
```

---

### **Explanation**
1. **Window Functions**:  
   - `LEAD(activity)` identifies subsequent events within each `case_id`, ordered chronologically.
   - The window clause (`WINDOW w`) ensures partitioning by `case_id` and ordering by `timestamp`.

2. **Date Handling**:  
   - Convert timestamps to dates (`::DATE`) to simplify day calculations.
   - Use `DATEDIFF` to compute days between `create_order_date` and `confirm_order_date`.

3. **Exclusion Logic**:  
   - The final query excludes all events from cases meeting both criteria using `NOT IN`.

This approach efficiently filters out non-compliant cases while retaining all other data for analysis[1][6].
