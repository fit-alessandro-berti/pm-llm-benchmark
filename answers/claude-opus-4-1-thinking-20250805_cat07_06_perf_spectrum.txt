This is a Sankey diagram or flow visualization showing the progression of what appears to be a fine collection process over time. The diagram has three distinct horizontal bands or stages:

1. **"Send Fine"** (top band) - shown in gray
2. **"Insert Fine Notification"** (middle band) - shown with pink/salmon colored flows
3. **"Send for Credit Collection"** (bottom band) - destination for some flows

The visualization spans a time period from January 25, 2000 to April 24, 2013 (shown on the x-axis). 

The flowing ribbons between the stages represent the movement and volume of cases through the process. The gray vertical lines in the top section represent individual fines being issued. These then flow down to the notification stage (middle), where we can see pink/red colored streams indicating fine notifications being inserted into the system. Some of these cases ultimately flow to the bottom stage, representing cases that are sent for credit collection.

The varying thickness of the flows indicates the volume or number of cases at different points in time, and the way the flows connect between stages shows how cases progress through this administrative or legal process. This type of visualization is particularly useful for identifying patterns, bottlenecks, or trends in how fines are processed and collected over the 13-year period shown.
