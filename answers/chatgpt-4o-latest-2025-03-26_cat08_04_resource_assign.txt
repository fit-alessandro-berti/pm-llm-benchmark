Certainly! To help TechSolve Solutions address its growing IT service inefficiencies, we will apply a comprehensive, data-driven approach powered by process mining tools and techniques. The goal is to uncover root causes of inefficient resource assignment, provide actionable insight into resource behavior, and propose practical optimization strategies tailored to the realities captured in the event log.

---

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

This phase focuses on converting TechSolve's event logs into insights about agent performance, skill usage, and actual resource assignment workflows.

### 1.1 Resource Performance Metrics

By enriching and filtering the event log, we will calculate the following key performance indicators (KPIs) for individual agents, tiers (L1–L3), and skill categories:

| Metric                         | Purpose                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ticket Volume per Agent/Tier  | Identify workload distribution and under/over-utilized staff                        |
| Average Handling Time         | Measure how long agents spend per activity (Work Start to Work End)                |
| First Call Resolution (FCR)   | % of tickets closed by L1 without escalation                                        |
| Number of Escalations         | Gauge how often agents need to escalate—high rates may indicate training gaps       |
| Skill Match % on Assignment   | % of assignments where the agent’s skills matched ticket requirements               |
| Ticket Types per Agent        | Understand specialization and experience in categories and required skills          |
| Idle Time vs Handling Time    | Identify operational availability vs actual activity—useful for utilization analysis|

These metrics will be extracted from timestamp differences, resource tags, and ticket attributes.

### 1.2 Process Mining Techniques

Process mining tools like Celonis, ProM, or Disco will be used to convert the log into visual and analytical formats through:

- **Resource Interaction/Handovers (Heuristic Miner / Social Network Miner):**
  - Identify high handover paths (e.g., L1 Agent A05  L2 Agent B12  L2 Agent B15).
  - Visualize frequent reassignments and cross-role interactions.
  - Compare actual reassignments with intended logic (e.g., should have gone to a DB specialist from start, but first went to App specialist).

- **Role Discovery:**
  - Mine roles by clustering agents based on activity and skills handled versus declared roles.
  - Detect role deviations, such as L2 agents doing L1-level tasks or miscategorized incidents.

- **Trace Variant Analysis:**
  - Discover dominant process variants, e.g., “Create  Assign L1  Work L1  Escalate L2  Reassign  Work L2  Resolve”.
  - Identify variants with excessive steps, delays, or escalations versus streamlined paths.

### 1.3 Skill Utilization Analysis

Match incidents’ Required Skills to agent-assigned skills over time:

- Build a skill-to-task mapping matrix:
  - Rows = Required Skills (e.g., DB-SQL, Networking-Firewall)
  - Columns = Agent IDs
  - Cells = Count of times that agent handled tasks requiring that skill

- Analyze:
  - Are certain specialists underutilized in their core skill?
  - Are generalists performing specialty tasks ineffectively?
  - Are certain tasks consistently misrouted to the wrong skill set (e.g., OS-issues sent to App specialists)?

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Leveraging the analysis above, we focus on quantifying and localizing resource-related inefficiencies.

### 2.1 Resource-Specific Bottlenecks & Misalignments

| Problem                                        | Detection Approach                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Skill Mismatch                                 | % of escalated/reassigned tickets where initial assignee lacked the required skill            |
| Reassignment Delay                             | Avg duration between "Reassign"  New "Assign"  "Work Start"                                 |
| Escalation Frequency from L1                   | High % of incidents escalated from specific agents or categories                               |
| SLA Breach Correlation                         | Analyze tickets breaching SLA and their assignment/escalation timelines                       |
| Under/Overload Distribution                    | Ticket volume vs. handling time histogram across agents and tiers                             |
| Reassignment Loops                             | Cases with multiple 'Assign' + 'Reassign' + 'Escalate' workflow loops                         |

### 2.2 Quantifying Impact

Sample metrics to quantify inefficiencies:

- Average Delay per Reassignment:  
  = Average(Timestamp of new "Work Start" – previous "Work End")

- % of SLA Breaches with 1 Reassignment:  
  = Count(Breached with Reassignment) / Total Breached

- % of Misassigned Tickets at L1:  
  = Tickets assigned without matching Required Skill to agent’s Skill Set

- Skill Bottlenecks:
   Identify commonly requested skills with very few matching agents; e.g., if 30% of tickets need 'Security-IAM' but only 2 agents can handle them.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Root cause analysis combines metrics and trace variants to understand systemic flaws in resource assignment.

### 3.1 Potential Root Causes

| Root Cause                                           | Supporting Evidence                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rule-based assignment ignores skills/workload       | High % skill mismatches in assignments; overloaded specialists           |
| Incomplete agent skill profiles                      | Agents marked as 'Basic' perform skill-specific work or escalate wrongly |
| Weak ticket classification                          | Frequent skill correction during escalation or reassignment              |
| L1 insufficient training or authority               | High L1-to-L2 escalation rate for common, solvable issues                |
| Lack of visibility into availability/load           | Round-robin creates uneven distribution; idle agents coexist with overload|

### 3.2 Process Mining Application

- **Variant Analysis:**
  - Compare low-resolution-time tickets vs high-delay tickets
  - Identify differences in resolution paths (e.g., unnecessary escalations, delayed work starts)

- **Decision Mining:**
  - Use decision trees (based on ticket category, channel, and initial skill action) to uncover predictors of correct vs incorrect assignment

Example:
“If tickets with category=‘Software-App’ and keyword=‘CRM’ are assigned to L1 agents with no App-CRM skill,  high chance of reassignment”

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

We propose three concrete strategies based on the insights uncovered:

### Strategy 1: Skill-Based Ticket Routing (Skill Match Engine)

-  Issue Addressed: Improper assignments ignoring ticket skill requirements
-  Insights Used:
  - Analysis shows that many agents are assigned tickets for which they lack matching skills.
  - First-call resolution is abysmally low for L1 due to skill mismatch.

-  Required Data:
  - Agent skill profiles (updated)
  - Ticket category & Required Skill
  - Ticket routing logic (rules or ML model)

-  Implementation:
  - Integrate a rule-based engine or ML classifier for assigning tickets to agents that match required skills.
  - Prioritize agents with both skill and current availability (connect with workload tracking).

-  Expected Benefits:
  - Fewer escalations (+10–15% increase in L1 resolution)
  - Reduction in SLA breaches due to faster, correct resolution path
  - Reduction in unnecessary use of L2/L3 resources

---

### Strategy 2: Workload- and Availability-Aware Dispatching

-  Issue Addressed: Uneven workload, overloaded specialists, idle agents
-  Insights Used:
  - Agent performance and activity timelines show idle capacity coexisting with overload.
  - Static round-robin distribution doesn’t consider live workloads.

-  Required Data:
  - Real-time ticket queue lengths
  - Agent availability (logged-in time, current assignments in progress)
  - Agent historical task durations

-  Implementation:
  - Build a dispatching heuristic or scoring model:
    `Assignment Score = (Skill Match) + (Availability Score) – (Current Load)`

  - Implement via workflow engine or intelligent workload balancer

-  Expected Benefits:
  - Smoother load distribution
  - Better utilization of available workforce at all tiers
  - Improved resolution times and reduced reassignments

---

### Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Using Machine Learning

-  Issue Addressed: Inaccurate initial ticket classification and assignment
-  Insights Used:
  - High reassignments stem from miscategorized or misrouted tickets
  - Certain indicators in ticket descriptions and categories map to real required skills

-  Required Data:
  - Historical ticket data with attributes: Description, Category, Outcome Path
  - Resolved ticket skill usage patterns
  - Agent profiles

-  Implementation:
  - Train a ML model (multi-class classifier) to predict:
    - Required Skill
    - Optimal Tier to handle ticket
  - Integrate into intake pipeline to pre-determine suitable agents or pools

-  Expected Benefits:
  - Reduced reliance on manual Dispatcher assignment
  - Tickets more likely to start with the right agent
  - Reduction in “Reassign” events by 20%+

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### 5.1 Business Process Simulation

Before full deployment, we simulate changes using process mining tools with "what-if" capability:

| Simulation Objective                          | Inputs                                      | Expected Outcome                                   |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Strategy A: Skill-based routing               | Enhanced agent profiles, skill mapping      | % change in FCR, escalation rate reduction        |
| Strategy B: Load-based dispatching            | Agent availability data, historical loads   | Queue times per priority class under new policy   |
| Strategy C: Predictive routing                | ML predictions on active tickets            | Reduced average resolution/assignment latencies   |

Tools like BIMP, Celonis (Process Simulation), or AnyLogic can test scenarios under different arrival rates and resource shifts.

### 5.2 Post-Implementation Monitoring with Process Mining

Once implemented, continuous tracking is key.

| KPI                                   | Monitoring Objective                                      |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Average Assignment Accuracy %        | Does the agent match required skill in first attempt?     |
| First Contact Resolution Rate (FCR)  | Track monthly improvements at L1                          |
| Escalation Rate                      | Monitor by category, agent, and skill                     |
| Ticket Reassignment Count per Case   | Lower reassignments = better routing                      |
| SLA Compliance Rate (P1–P4)          | Direct outcome of streamlined resources                   |
| Agent Utilization Ratio              | Balanced workloads across all tiers                       |
| Skill Usage Heatmap                  | Visual skill distribution changes, specialist coverage     |

Build process dashboards that offer real-time and retrospective views using process mining suites.
