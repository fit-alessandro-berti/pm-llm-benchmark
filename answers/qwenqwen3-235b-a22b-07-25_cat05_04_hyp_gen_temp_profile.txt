**Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model**

1. **Receive to Approve (R  P):**  
   - Average time: ~25 hours  
   - Standard deviation: 1 hour (very low)  
   - **Anomaly:** The extremely low standard deviation suggests a rigid, almost mechanical timing between claim receipt and approval. Such consistency is unusual in real-world processes involving human judgment or variable evaluation complexity.

2. **Approve to Notify (P  N):**  
   - Average time: 7 days  
   - Standard deviation: 2 days  
   - **Anomaly:** A full week delay between approval and customer notification is excessive. The high standard deviation indicates inconsistent handling—some notifications occur quickly, others are significantly delayed—pointing to irregular workflow execution.

3. **Assign to Close (A  C):**  
   - Average time: 2 hours  
   - Standard deviation: 1 hour  
   - **Anomaly:** Closing a claim just 2 hours after assignment, on average, raises concerns about whether required intermediate steps (Evaluate, Approve, Notify) are being skipped or recorded improperly.

4. **Evaluate to Notify (E  N):**  
   - Average time: 5 minutes  
   - Standard deviation: 1 minute  
   - **Anomaly:** Such a short and tightly clustered interval suggests that notification occurs almost immediately after evaluation, potentially skipping the approval step or indicating automated or erroneous timestamping.

**Hypotheses for the Anomalies**

1. **R  P with low STDEV:**  
   Approvals may be scheduled automatically (e.g., batch processing every 24–26 hours), regardless of actual claim readiness. Alternatively, timestamps might be system-generated rather than reflecting real human activity, leading to artificial consistency.

2. **P  N long delay and high variance:**  
   There may be a manual or paper-based notification process that is inconsistently executed. Bottlenecks could arise from unassigned tasks, lack of follow-up systems, or regional staffing shortages causing some notifications to be delayed by days.

3. **A  C too fast:**  
   Some claims might be closed prematurely due to system errors, misclassification, or adjusters bypassing required steps. It's also possible that "Close" is being used as a placeholder or for administrative closure without full processing.

4. **E  N too fast:**  
   The near-instantaneous transition suggests that either:
   - The "Approve" step is being skipped or merged with evaluation,
   - Timestamps are incorrectly recorded (e.g., default values),
   - Or notifications are sent in bulk immediately after evaluation without awaiting formal approval.

**Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries**

**1. Identify claims with unusually short R  P time and low variance (suspected automation):**
```sql
WITH claim_timeline AS (
  SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS r_to_p_duration
  FROM claim_events ce1
  JOIN claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
  WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'P'
    AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
)
SELECT 
  AVG(r_to_p_duration) AS avg_r_to_p_sec,
  STDDEV(r_to_p_duration) AS stddev_r_to_p_sec,
  COUNT(*) AS claim_count
FROM claim_timeline
WHERE r_to_p_duration BETWEEN 86400 AND 93600; -- Filter around 24–26 hours
```

**2. Find claims where P  N exceeds 5 days (to investigate notification delays):**
```sql
WITH p_to_n_gaps AS (
  SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS approve_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS p_to_n_duration_sec
  FROM claim_events ce1
  JOIN claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
  WHERE ce1.activity = 'P'
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
)
SELECT 
  c.claim_id,
  c.claim_type,
  c.claim_amount,
  a.name AS adjuster_name,
  a.region,
  p_to_n_gaps.p_to_n_duration_sec / 86400 AS p_to_n_days
FROM p_to_n_gaps
JOIN claims c ON p_to_n_gaps.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE p_to_n_gaps.p_to_n_duration_sec > 432000; -- >5 days
ORDER BY p_to_n_days DESC;
```

**3. Detect claims closed within 3 hours of assignment (possible premature closure):**
```sql
WITH a_to_c_gaps AS (
  SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS assign_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS a_to_c_duration_sec
  FROM claim_events ce1
  JOIN claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
  WHERE ce1.activity = 'A'
    AND ce2.activity = 'C'
    AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
)
SELECT 
  ac.claim_id,
  c.claim_type,
  c.claim_amount,
  ac.a_to_c_duration_sec / 3600 AS a_to_c_hours,
  a.name AS assignee_name,
  a.region,
  -- Check if Evaluate and Approve occurred between A and C
  BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'E') AS has_evaluate,
  BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'P') AS has_approve
FROM a_to_c_gaps ac
JOIN claims c ON ac.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON ac.claim_id = ce.claim_id 
  AND ce.timestamp BETWEEN ac.assign_time AND ac.close_time
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name AND ce.activity = 'A'
GROUP BY ac.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount, ac.a_to_c_duration_sec, a.name, a.region
HAVING ac.a_to_c_duration_sec <= 10800 -- <= 3 hours
   AND (NOT BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'E') OR NOT BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'P'))
ORDER BY a_to_c_hours;
```

**4. Investigate claims with E  N within 60 seconds (potential skipped steps):**
```sql
WITH e_to_n_gaps AS (
  SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS e_to_n_duration_sec
  FROM claim_events ce1
  JOIN claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
  WHERE ce1.activity = 'E'
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
)
SELECT 
  en.claim_id,
  c.claim_type,
  en.e_to_n_duration_sec,
  -- Verify if 'P' (Approve) occurred between E and N
  CASE WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce 
    WHERE ce.claim_id = en.claim_id 
      AND ce.activity = 'P'
      AND ce.timestamp BETWEEN en.evaluate_time AND en.notify_time
  ) THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS approved_before_notify
FROM e_to_n_gaps en
JOIN claims c ON en.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE en.e_to_n_duration_sec <= 60
ORDER BY en.e_to_n_duration_sec;
```
