### **Textual BPMN-Like Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

#### **Start Event**  
- **Event:** Invoice received (typically via email)

---

#### **Task 1: Validate Purchase Order (PO) Presence**  
- **Performer:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
- **Description:** Check whether the invoice includes a valid PO number.  
- **Outcome:**  
  - **If no PO exists:**  
    - **Sub-flow:**  
      - Send request to supplier for PO information or corrected invoice  
      - **Involvement:** Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager) may be contacted to follow up  
      - Once PO is provided, return to Task 1  
    - **Artifacts:** Email correspondence, supplier invoice  
  - **If PO exists:** Proceed to next task  

---

#### **Task 2: Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
- **Performer:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
- **System:** Accounting/ERP system  
- **Input:** Invoice with valid PO  
- **Output:** Logged invoice record  
- **Artifact:** Invoice data in system  

---

#### **Task 3: Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Goods Receipt Confirmation**  
- **Performer:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
- **Recipient:** Purchasing Department (Dan)  
- **Mechanism:** Email or internal system notification  
- **Artifact:** Invoice packet sent  

---

#### **Gateway 1: Was Goods Receipt Confirmed?**  
- **Type:** Exclusive Gateway (XOR)  
- **Decision Logic:** Based on Purchasing’s verification of delivery  
- **Paths:**  
  - **Yes:** Proceed to **Task 4: Match Invoice to PO**  
  - **No / Unable to Confirm:**  
    - **Action:** Hold invoice; contact supplier (directly or via Karen) for delivery proof  
    - **Possible Outcome:** Escalation to Rita (AP Supervisor) if unresolved  

---

#### **Task 4: Match Invoice Line Items to PO**  
- **Performer:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
- **Activity:** Compare quantities, prices, delivery charges  
- **System:** ERP/accounting system (PO matching functionality)  
- **Inputs:** Invoice, PO, delivery confirmation  

---

#### **Gateway 2: Is Invoice in Agreement with PO?**  
- **Type:** Exclusive Gateway (XOR)  
- **Paths:**  
  - **Yes – Match Confirmed:**  
    - Proceed to **Task 5: Request Manager Approval**  
  - **No – Discrepancy Detected:**  
    - **Action:**  
      - Notify Purchasing team for clarification  
      - If minor, resolve via email with Dan or supplier  
      - If major or unresolved: **Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita)**  
        - Rita coordinates with Karen (if supplier issue), department head (for retrospective PO), or contract team  
        - Once resolved, return to **Task 4** (re-check match)  

---

#### **Task 5: Request Department Manager Approval**  
- **Performer:** System (automated), initiated by Accounts Payable Clerk  
- **Mechanism:** System sends notification/email to Department Manager (Carlos)  
- **Information Provided:**  
  - Invoice details  
  - Associated PO  
  - Purchasing confirmation  
  - Discrepancy resolution notes (if applicable)  

---

#### **Gateway 3: Does Manager Approve Invoice?**  
- **Type:** Exclusive Gateway (XOR)  
- **Performer:** Department Manager (Carlos)  
- **Paths:**  
  - **Approved:**  
    - Proceed to **Task 6: Schedule Payment**  
  - **Rejected / Flagged for Investigation:**  
    - **Action:**  
      - Manager sends reason back to Accounts Payable Clerk  
      - Invoice is placed on hold  
      - Mary investigates (with Dan or Karen as needed)  
      - Once resolved, re-submit for approval (loop back to **Task 5**)  
    - **Note:** Rejections are rare (~once every 2 months)  

---

#### **Task 6: Schedule Payment**  
- **Performer:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
- **Activity:** Add invoice to next payment run in accounting system  
- **Final Output:** Payment scheduled, supplier paid on cycle  
- **Artifact:** Payment record, cleared invoice  

---

#### **End Event**  
- **Event:** Payment executed  
- **Status:** Invoice fully processed  

---

### **Exception & Variations Summary**

- **Missing PO:**  
  - Invoice returned to supplier; Karen may assist  
  - Retrospective PO possible via AP Supervisor and department head  
- **Discrepancy in Price/Quantity:**  
  - Clarify with Purchasing  Supplier  Contract (via Karen)  
  - Escalate to Rita if stuck  
- **Manager Rejection:**  
  - Investigate and re-submit; process restarts approval step  
- **Automated Notifications:**  
  - System triggers manager approval and logs actions  

---

### **Key Roles & Responsibilities**

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Accounts Payable Clerk** | Initial validation, logging, matching, follow-up on discrepancies |
| **Purchasing Officer** | Confirm goods received, validate PO alignment |
| **Department Manager** | Final approval based on budget, accuracy, legitimacy |
| **AP Supervisor** | Resolve exceptions, escalate issues, ensure process continuity |
| **Supplier Relationship Manager** | Coordinate with suppliers on missing info, pricing, revised invoices |

---

### **Artifacts & Data Objects**

- Supplier Invoice (email attachment or paper)  
- Purchase Order (PO)  
- Goods Receipt Record  
- Invoice-PO Match Report  
- Approval Request & Response  
- Payment Schedule  

---

### **Ambiguities & Notes**

- **PO-less Invoices:** Process not fully defined—appears ad hoc and handled by Rita with department heads; may involve informal approvals or retrospective documentation.  
- **Payment Timing:** Exact frequency of payment runs not specified—assumed periodic (e.g., weekly).  
- **System Integration:** Some steps (e.g., manager approval) imply system integration, but full workflow automation level unclear. Manual email reliance noted.
