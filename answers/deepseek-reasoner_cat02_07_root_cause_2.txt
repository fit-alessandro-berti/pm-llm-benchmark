**1. Identification of Cases with Performance Issues**  
The cases with significantly longer durations are:  
- **Case 2003** (48.3 hours, High Complexity, Region A)  
- **Case 2005** (77.1 hours, High Complexity, Region B)  
- **Case 2002** (25.9 hours, Medium Complexity, Region B).  

**2. Root Cause Analysis**  

| **Attribute**    | **Key Findings**                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Complexity**    | - High-complexity claims (2003, 2005) involve **multiple "Request Additional Documents"** steps, leading to prolonged cycles. <br> - Case 2005 required **3 document requests**, each adding 1+ days of delay. |
| **Resource**      | - **Adjuster_Lisa** (Region B) handled Case 2005, which had repeated document requests. <br> - **Manager_Bill** (used in Cases 2003, 2005) took longer to approve claims (e.g., 23 hours after the last document request in Case 2003) compared to **Manager_Ann** (e.g., same-day approval in Case 2001). |
| **Region**        | - **Region B** had the longest case (2005) due to High Complexity + repeated document requests. <br> - Region B’s Adjuster_Lisa and Manager_Bill may be bottlenecks for high-complexity cases. |

**3. Explanations and Mitigation Strategies**  

| **Root Cause**                          | **Explanation**                                                                 | **Mitigation**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Complexity Claims**              | Frequent document requests lead to rework and waiting times.                   | - **Pre-emptive document checklists** for high-complexity claims. <br> - **Automate document validation** during submission. |
| **Adjuster Workload/Inefficiency**      | Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) may be overloaded or lacks support for complex cases.  | - **Balance workloads** across adjusters. <br> - **Specialize teams** for high-complexity claims. |
| **Manager Approval Delays**             | Manager_Bill’s slower approvals worsen delays (vs. Manager_Ann).               | - **Redistribute approvals** to faster managers. <br> - **Set SLAs** for approval steps. |
| **Region B Bottlenecks**                | Region B handles high-complexity cases with fewer optimized resources.         | - **Add regional resources** (e.g., more adjusters/managers). <br> - **Share best practices** from Region A. |

**Summary**: Performance issues stem from **high-complexity claims requiring iterative document requests**, compounded by slower approvals (Manager_Bill) and potential resource constraints in Region B. Streamlining documentation, reallocating resources, and setting approval SLAs can reduce lead times.
