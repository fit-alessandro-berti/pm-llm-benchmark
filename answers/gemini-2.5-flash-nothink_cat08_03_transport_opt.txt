## Process Mining for Speedy Parcels: Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Operations

Speedy Parcels' challenge of late deliveries and rising operational costs in a dense urban and suburban environment is a classic case where process mining can deliver significant value. By leveraging their rich event data, we can gain deep insights into their actual operations and identify actionable strategies for improvement.

### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

**Data Preprocessing and Integration:**

The first crucial step is to consolidate the disparate data sources into a unified event log. This involves:

*   **Timestamp Normalization:** Ensure all timestamps (GPS, scanner, dispatch, maintenance) are in a consistent format and timezone.
*   **Case ID Definition:** The prompt suggests "Vehicle-Day" (e.g., `V12-20241205`) as a Case ID, which is excellent for tracking a single vehicle's full daily operation. We need to ensure all events related to that vehicle on that day are grouped under this ID. If specific package-level analysis is needed, an additional `Case ID` like "Package-Day" (`P9876-20241205`) could be derived for processes centered around individual package journeys. For this analysis, `Vehicle-Day` seems more appropriate for operational efficiency.
*   **Activity/Event Name Standardization:** Map raw data points to meaningful, distinct activities.
    *   **GPS:** `Ignition On` -> `Vehicle Start`, `Moving` -> `In Transit`, `Idle/Stopped` -> `Vehicle Idling`, `Ignition Off` -> `Vehicle Stop`.
    *   **Scanner:** `Scan at Depot` -> `Loading Packages`, `Arrive Customer` -> `Arrive at Customer`, `Delivery Success` -> `Deliver Package`, `Delivery Failed (Attempted)` -> `Attempt Failed Delivery`, `Depart Customer` -> `Depart Customer`.
    *   **Dispatch:** `Route Assigned` -> `Route Planning Complete`, `Planned Stop` (derived from planned routes) -> `Planned Delivery Stop`.
    *   **Maintenance:** `Maintenance Start` -> `Vehicle Maintenance (Scheduled/Unscheduled)`, `Maintenance End` -> `Vehicle Available`.
*   **Attribute Enrichment:** Attach relevant attributes to each event: `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Package ID` (if applicable to the event), `Location`, `Speed`, `Planned Duration`, `Actual Duration`, `Distance Traveled`, `Fuel Consumption` (derived from GPS and vehicle specs).
*   **Event Log Format:** The final log should adhere to the XES (eXtensible Event Stream) standard or a similar structure with at least Case ID, Activity Name, and Timestamp for each event.

**Challenges Encountered:**

*   **Granularity Mismatch:** GPS data is very granular (frequent points), while scanner data is event-driven. Requires intelligent aggregation or interpolation (e.g., inferring "Travel to Customer" from GPS points between "Depart Customer" and "Arrive Customer" events).
*   **Missing or Inconsistent Data:** GPS signal loss, scanner battery issues, manual entry errors in dispatch or maintenance logs. Imputation or robust handling of missing values will be necessary.
*   **Defining "Stop":** Differentiating a legitimate delivery stop from a short parking break or a traffic stop solely from GPS. Combining with scanner data (`Arrive Customer`) is key. GPS "Unscheduled Stop" needs to be defined as distinct from a `Delivery Stop`.
*   **Data Volume:** Six months of detailed GPS data for an entire fleet will be massive, requiring efficient data processing tools.

**Process Discovery Algorithms:**

Using algorithms like Alpha Miner, Heuristic Miner, Inductive Miner, or Disco's built-in discovery, we would visualize the *actual* end-to-end delivery process.

1.  **High-Level Process Map:** Start with a simplified view showing major phases: `Start Shift` -> `Loading Packages` -> `Depart Depot` -> `Travel to Customer` -> `Arrive at Customer` -> (`Deliver Package` / `Attempt Failed Delivery`) -> `Depart Customer` -> ... -> `Arrive Depot` -> `End Shift`.
2.  **Detailed Process Map:** Drill down to show loops (e.g., multiple delivery stops), parallel activities, and deviations (e.g., `Vehicle Maintenance (Unscheduled)`, `Low Speed Detected` (traffic/delay)). The model would reveal common sequences, frequent reworks (e.g., routes for failed deliveries), and common detours.
3.  **Variant Analysis:** Identify the most frequent and longest-running process variants. This would immediately highlight "happy paths" vs. "exception paths" (e.g., routes with many failed deliveries, routes with unexpected maintenance stops).

**Conformance Checking:**

Comparing the discovered process models against the *planned* routes from the dispatch system is crucial for identifying deviations.

1.  **Creating a Reference Model:** The "Planned Route" from the Dispatch System can serve as a reference model. This involves converting the planned sequence of stops and estimated travel times into a process model.
2.  **Techniques:**
    *   **Token Replay:** Replay actual events against the planned model. Deviations (missing tokens, extra tokens, replayed tokens) highlight non-conformance.
    *   **Fitness:** Measures how well the actual process executions fit the planned model. A low fitness score indicates significant deviations.
    *   **Alignment:** Identifies the minimum cost sequence of activities (insertions, deletions, moves) required to transform the observed trace into a conforming trace of the model. This pinpoints exact points of deviation.

**Types of Deviations to Look For:**

*   **Sequence Deviations:**
    *   **Skipped Stops:** Planned delivery locations not visited.
    *   **Reordered Stops:** Deliveries made out of the planned sequence (e.g., driver optimizing on the fly, but perhaps less optimally than dispatch).
    *   **Unplanned Stops:** `Unscheduled Stop`, `Vehicle Maintenance` (if not planned for the shift), or general non-delivery stops (e.g., driver breaks not aligned with planned breaks, or personal detours).
*   **Timing Differences (Performance Deviations):**
    *   **Late Departures/Arrivals:** Vehicles leaving the depot late, or arriving at customer locations significantly later than planned.
    *   **Excessive Travel Time:** Actual travel time between stops significantly exceeding planned travel time.
    *   **Prolonged Service Time:** Time spent at customer locations (`Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer`) being much longer than estimated, or longer than the average `Deliver Package` activity.
    *   **Excessive Idling:** Long periods of `Vehicle Idling` not associated with a delivery stop (e.g., waiting in traffic, searching for parking, or driver breaks).
*   **Resource Deviations:** Driver assigned to a different vehicle or route than planned.
*   **Outcome Deviations:** High rates of `Attempt Failed Delivery` compared to `Delivery Success` on specific routes or drivers, indicating issues with customer availability or access.

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

From the event log, these KPIs can be calculated:

*   **On-Time Delivery Rate:**
    *   Numerator: Count of `Delivery Success` events where `Arrive at Customer` timestamp is within the customer's requested time window.
    *   Denominator: Total `Delivery Success` events.
*   **Average Time per Delivery Stop (Service Time):**
    *   Calculated as `Depart Customer` - `Arrive at Customer` for each successful delivery. Aggregated by driver, route, or location.
*   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:**
    *   Total `In Transit` duration / Total `Service Time` (sum of `Average Time per Delivery Stop`). Helps understand time allocation.
*   **Fuel Consumption per km/package:**
    *   Requires vehicle-specific fuel consumption rates (from maintenance logs/specs) combined with `Distance Traveled` (from GPS). `Fuel Consumption = Distance * Rate_per_KM`. Then aggregate by `Package ID` or total packages for a day.
*   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:**
    *   `(Total `In Transit` + Total `Service Time`) / (`End Shift` - `Start Shift`)`
*   **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:**
    *   Count and total duration of `Low Speed Detected` events that are not associated with a delivery stop or explicit idling. Can be correlated with location data to identify hotspots.
*   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:**
    *   `Count of `Attempt Failed Delivery` events / Total `Arrive at Customer` events`.
*   **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) / Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** From maintenance logs. `Maintenance End` - `Maintenance Start` for MTTR.
*   **Overtime Hours:** `End Shift` - `Start Shift` minus standard shift length (e.g., 8 hours).

**Process Mining Techniques for Bottleneck Identification:**

*   **Process Map Annotation (Performance View):** Overlay process maps with performance metrics:
    *   **Activity Durations:** Color-code activities by average duration. Longest activities are potential bottlenecks (e.g., `Travel to Customer` between certain areas, `Loading Packages` at depot, or `Attempt Failed Delivery`).
    *   **Throughput Times:** Measure time taken to traverse paths or complete sub-processes (e.g., `Depart Depot` to `Arrive Depot` for a full shift, `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer` for service time).
    *   **Waiting Times/Idle Times:** Identify where vehicles or drivers are waiting unnecessarily (e.g., long `Vehicle Idling` events not tied to deliveries, time between `Loading Packages` and `Depart Depot`).
*   **Bottleneck Analysis Tools:**
    *   **Resource Perspective:** Analyze performance by `Driver ID`, `Vehicle ID`, or even `Location` (e.g., specific neighborhoods).
        *   Are certain drivers consistently taking longer on routes?
        *   Are certain vehicles prone to more maintenance stops or slow travel?
        *   Are deliveries to specific areas (`Location`) consistently taking longer due to parking issues, building access, etc.?
    *   **Time Perspective:** Analyze performance by `Time of Day` and `Day of Week`.
        *   Are morning or afternoon peaks leading to delays?
        *   Is Friday traffic worse than Monday?
    *   **Cost Analysis:** Integrate estimated costs (fuel, labor) with process activities to visualize cost hotspots on the process map.
*   **Filtering and Root Cause Drill-down:**
    *   Filter cases by performance (e.g., "all cases where On-Time Delivery Rate < 80%"). Then discover the process for *only* these cases to see what unique paths or activities are present.
    *   Compare process models of "high-performing" vs. "low-performing" routes/drivers to visually identify differences.

**Quantifying Bottleneck Impact:**

*   **Statistical Analysis:** Calculate the statistical significance of performance differences between bottleneck and non-bottleneck cases (e.g., t-tests on average duration).
*   **Cost-Benefit Estimation:** Estimate the financial impact of reducing bottleneck durations (e.g., how much fuel saved by reducing 10 minutes of idling per day across the fleet).
*   **Simulations:** If a bottleneck is identified, simulate the process with and without the bottleneck to project improvements in KPIs.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

Beyond simply identifying *where* delays occur, process mining helps dig into *why*.

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
    *   **Process Mining Evidence:** Conformance checking will show significant `Sequence Deviations` (reordered stops) and `Unplanned Stops` (driver detours to optimize for uncaptured factors or mistakes). High `Travel Time vs. Service Time` ratio might indicate inefficient routing leading to excessive driving.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** If drivers consistently deviate from planned routes to seemingly optimize their path, it suggests the planned route algorithm isn't fully capturing real-world constraints or driver knowledge.
*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
    *   **Process Mining Evidence:** Consistent and significant differences between `Actual Travel Time` (derived from GPS between `Depart Customer` and `Arrive Customer`) and `Planned Travel Time`. `Low Speed Detected` events frequently occurring in specific geographical areas at specific times.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** Correlation of `Actual Travel Time` with `Time of Day`, `Day of Week`, and `Location` (e.g., rush hour in city center) will highlight where estimations are most off.
*   **Impact of Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
    *   **Process Mining Evidence:** Clusters of `Low Speed Detected` events at specific `Locations` and `Times`. Visualizing GPS tracks on a map with density overlays can show "slow zones." High `Travel Time vs. Service Time` ratio.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** Overlaying external traffic data (historical or real-time if available) with the event log and GPS coordinates can directly link congestion to delays. Analyzing `Actual Travel Time` variance.
*   **High Variability in Service Time at Customer Locations:**
    *   **Process Mining Evidence:** Wide variance in `Average Time per Delivery Stop` for different customers, areas, or package types. `Vehicle Idling` at customer locations.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** Drill down into specific customer types, building types (e.g., apartment blocks vs. single homes), or package characteristics (e.g., large items requiring assistance) to see if these correlate with longer service times. Analyze notes on `Delivery Success` or `Attempt Failed Delivery` for common issues (e.g., "difficult parking," "customer not answering").
*   **Frequency and Impact of Vehicle Breakdowns or Maintenance Needs During Shifts:**
    *   **Process Mining Evidence:** Presence of `Vehicle Maintenance (Unscheduled)` events during operational hours. Analysis of event sequences around these events to determine pre-breakdown behavior (e.g., slow speeds, multiple unscheduled stops before breakdown). High `MTTR`.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** Correlate `Vehicle Maintenance (Unscheduled)` with `Vehicle ID`, `Age of Vehicle`, or `Mileage` (from maintenance logs) to identify problematic vehicles or maintenance schedules. Analyze the impact on `On-Time Delivery Rate` for that specific vehicle-day.
*   **Driver Behavior or Skill Differences:**
    *   **Process Mining Evidence:** `Variant Analysis` showing significantly different process flows or performance metrics when comparing routes handled by different `Driver IDs` on similar routes. Discrepancies in `Average Time per Delivery Stop`, `Fuel Consumption per km`, `Rate of Failed Deliveries`, or `Adherence to Planned Routes` across drivers.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** Compare `Travel Speed` profiles, `Idling Time` percentage, or the frequency of `Unscheduled Stop` for different drivers. Look for patterns in how experienced drivers handle exceptions vs. newer drivers.
*   **Issues Related to Failed Delivery Attempts (requiring re-delivery):**
    *   **Process Mining Evidence:** High frequency of `Attempt Failed Delivery` events. Subsequent `Return to Depot` or `Reattempt Delivery` events.
    *   **Root Cause Validation:** Analyze `Notes` for `Attempt Failed Delivery` (e.g., "customer not home," "no access," "wrong address"). Correlate `Failed Deliveries` with `Time Window`, `Customer Type`, or `Location` to identify underlying issues with scheduling, communication, or accessibility.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Here are three distinct, concrete, data-driven optimization strategies for Speedy Parcels:

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Route Optimization with Real-Time Traffic Integration**

*   **Targets:** Suboptimal route planning, inaccurate travel time estimations, impact of traffic congestion.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Static route planning that doesn't account for real-time traffic or dynamic operational changes, leading to inefficient travel and delays.
*   **Process Mining Insights & Data Support:**
    *   **Conformance Checking:** Will reveal high non-conformance due to `Sequence Deviations` (drivers re-optimizing on the fly) and `Excessive Travel Time` due to traffic hotspots.
    *   **Performance Analysis:** Identifies specific `Locations` and `Times` where `Low Speed Detected` (traffic) or `Excessive Travel Time` are significant bottlenecks, and quantifies their impact on `On-Time Delivery Rate`.
    *   **Variant Analysis:** Shows how routes that encounter specific traffic conditions deviate significantly from planned routes and take longer.
*   **Proposal:**
    *   Develop or integrate with a dynamic routing system that continuously updates routes based on real-time traffic data (from external APIs or internal GPS data analysis), new delivery requests, or changes in customer availability.
    *   The system would proactively suggest route adjustments to drivers via their handhelds, avoiding known congestion points.
    *   Incorporate an algorithm that learns from historical `Actual Travel Time` data (mined from GPS logs) to improve future travel time estimations for specific segments at specific times, moving beyond simple static speed limits.
*   **Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
    *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Significantly increased due to avoiding delays.
    *   **Fuel Consumption per km:** Reduced by optimizing travel paths and avoiding stop-and-go traffic.
    *   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Improved, indicating more efficient movement.
    *   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Increased as vehicles spend less time in unproductive travel.

**Strategy 2: Proactive Failed Delivery Mitigation through Predictive Customer Engagement**

*   **Targets:** High rate of failed deliveries, variability in service time at customer locations (e.g., waiting for customer), re-delivery costs.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Lack of timely communication with customers about delivery status and time, and insufficient information about customer availability or access requirements.
*   **Process Mining Insights & Data Support:**
    *   **Performance Analysis:** Highlights specific routes, `Time Windows`, or `Customer Types` with a high `Rate of Failed Deliveries`.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Analysis of `Notes` associated with `Attempt Failed Delivery` events reveals common reasons (e.g., "customer not home," "no access," "business closed"). `Service Time` variance at specific locations could indicate issues like finding parking or gaining access.
    *   **Predictive Modeling (beyond basic PM):** Build a model (using PM outputs as features) to predict likelihood of failed delivery based on historical data (customer address, previous failed attempts, time of day, package size, etc.).
*   **Proposal:**
    *   Implement a system that, for high-risk deliveries (identified by the predictive model or specific historical patterns), sends a proactive SMS/app notification to the customer with a narrower estimated time window (e.g., "Your package will arrive in the next 30 minutes") and an option to reschedule or provide specific delivery instructions (e.g., "leave with concierge," "code 1234").
    *   For customers with a history of missed deliveries, the system could prompt a confirmation message the day before.
    *   This also includes refining customer time window offerings based on actual delivery patterns discovered, making them more realistic.
*   **Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
    *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Increased by reducing the need for re-delivery attempts.
    *   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Drastically reduced.
    *   **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Potentially reduced as drivers spend less time waiting or dealing with access issues.
    *   **Fuel Consumption per package:** Reduced by avoiding re-delivery trips.

**Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance and Fleet Optimization**

*   **Targets:** Unscheduled vehicle breakdowns/maintenance, high vehicle maintenance costs, vehicle utilization rate.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Reactive maintenance schedule, lack of correlation between vehicle usage patterns and maintenance needs.
*   **Process Mining Insights & Data Support:**
    *   **Process Discovery:** Visualizes the frequency and position of `Vehicle Maintenance (Unscheduled)` events within daily operations, showing their disruptive impact.
    *   **Performance Analysis:** Quantifies the `MTTR` for unscheduled maintenance, and the direct impact on the `On-Time Delivery Rate` and total `Vehicle Utilization` for affected vehicles.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Correlates `Unscheduled Maintenance` with `Vehicle ID`, `Mileage` driven per day, `Average Speed` (indicating aggressive driving or high wear), or `Number of Stops` per day (indicating stop-and-go wear and tear) derived from GPS data and maintenance logs. Identifies vehicles or usage patterns most prone to breakdowns.
*   **Proposal:**
    *   Develop a predictive maintenance schedule using vehicle usage patterns. Instead of solely relying on fixed mileage or time intervals, schedule maintenance based on actual workload and wear parameters extracted from the GPS data (e.g., number of accelerations/decelerations, total engine hours, time spent in high-speed zones).
    *   Implement telematics systems to monitor key vehicle parameters (e.g., engine diagnostics, tire pressure) in real-time, feeding into the prediction model.
    *   Optimize fleet allocation by assigning vehicles more prone to issues to less critical or shorter routes when possible, or prioritizing replacement/overhaul for high-risk vehicles.
*   **Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
    *   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Increased by minimizing downtime from unscheduled repairs.
    *   **Operational Costs (Maintenance):** Reduced by moving from reactive to proactive, often less costly, maintenance.
    *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Improved by reducing unexpected vehicle unavailability and delays due to breakdowns.
    *   **Fuel Consumption:** Potentially reduced through optimally performing vehicles.

### 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

**Accounting for Operational Constraints:**

Any proposed strategy must be mindful of real-world constraints:

*   **Driver Working Hours:** Dynamic routing algorithms must incorporate legal driving hour limits, mandatory breaks, and overtime costs. Routes should be optimized to fit within standard shifts primarily.
*   **Vehicle Capacities:** Route optimization must always consider cubic capacity and weight limits of vans. The system should not suggest routes exceeding these.
*   **Customer Time Windows:** These are non-negotiable hard constraints. Dynamic routing must prioritize meeting these windows, even if it means slightly less optimal travel for other deliveries. Failed delivery mitigation must ensure rescheduling aligns with customer preferences and new valid windows.
*   **Driver Experience/Preferences:** While data-driven, a certain degree of flexibility or driver input might be needed (e.g., allowing drivers to mark certain parking spots or access points as difficult).
*   **Depot Operations:** Changes in routing and scheduling must integrate seamlessly with depot loading/unloading procedures to avoid creating new bottlenecks there.

**Continuous Monitoring using Process Mining Dashboards:**

After implementing changes, continuous monitoring is crucial to ensure effectiveness and identify new issues. A process mining dashboard would be invaluable, featuring:

*   **Key Metrics Overview:**
    *   **On-Time Delivery Rate (Overall and by Route/Driver):** Trending over time, with alerts for drops.
    *   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Tracking reduction targets.
    *   **Average Fuel Consumption per Package/KM:** Monitoring cost efficiency.
    *   **Average Service Time per Stop:** Tracking improvement in delivery efficiency.
    *   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Monitoring asset efficiency.
    *   **MTTR/MTBF:** Tracking maintenance effectiveness.
*   **Process Views:**
    *   **Live Process Map:** A simplified, high-level process map showing real-time throughput and activity durations, allowing quick identification of current bottlenecks.
    *   **Conformance Scorecard:** Continuous display of conformance scores for daily routes against planned models, immediately highlighting significant deviations.
    *   **Variant Trend:** Monitor the frequency of "unwanted" process variants (e.g., routes with `Unscheduled Stop` or multiple `Attempt Failed Delivery`) to ensure they are decreasing.
*   **Alerting System:** Automated alerts when KPIs fall below predefined thresholds or when certain process anomalies are detected (e.g., excessive idling time, vehicle stationary for too long outside a delivery zone).
*   **Resource Performance Comparison:** Dashboards allowing comparison of driver performance (e.g., `Avg. Service Time`, `Fuel Efficiency`, `Failed Delivery Rate`) or vehicle performance over time.
*   **Geospatial Overlays:** Integration with map views to visualize traffic hotspots, common unplanned stops, or high failed-delivery zones, allowing for quick visual inspection of geographic issues.

By continuously tracking these metrics and process views, Speedy Parcels can ensure their optimization strategies remain effective, adapt to changing conditions, and foster a culture of data-driven operational excellence.
