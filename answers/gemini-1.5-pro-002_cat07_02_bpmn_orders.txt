The visualization depicts a cross-functional flowchart for order processing, likely for a manufacturing company.  It breaks down the process across four departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse, using BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) elements.

Here's a breakdown of the process flow:

* **Sales:**
    * The process starts every Monday morning.
    * An order is checked for completeness.
    * The system checks if the customer exists in the database.
    * If the customer doesn't exist, they are added to the database.
    * Order details are then sent to the Production department.  If the product isn't sent, the sales process drafts an invoice and concludes.

* **Production:**
    * Receives order details from Sales.
    * Production planning takes place.
    * The product is manufactured.
    * Upon product completion, a signal is sent to the Warehouse department.
    * If the materials are faulty (implied by the dotted line connecting "Material not faulty" to the Material Compensation subprocess), the process moves to Procurement.

* **Procurement (Material Compensation Subprocess):**
    * This subprocess is triggered if materials are faulty.
    * Order details are received.
    * New materials are ordered.
    * Faulty materials are returned.
    * The received materials are checked.
    * If the materials fail checks, the order is canceled. If they pass, the process presumably resumes at the Manufacturing Product step in Production (though this is not explicitly shown).

* **Warehouse:**
    * Receives notification of product completion from Production.
    * Sends the product to the customer.
    * Sends a notification that the product has been sent, likely back to Sales to complete the invoicing process.


The dashed lines represent the flow of information or triggers between different departments and stages of the process. The solid lines represent the sequence of activities within each department. The different shapes represent different types of steps in the process (e.g., start event, activity, gateway, data object).  The use of a subprocess for Material Compensation helps highlight a specific exception handling flow within the larger order fulfillment process.
