### Explanation of Case Grouping and Activity Naming

**Case Identification:**  
Cases were grouped based on logical shifts in application and window activity that reflect meaningful user tasks or phases in a business process. For instance, when a user switches from editing a Word document to navigating an email inbox, and then back to editing Word again, this indicates a separate work session. Similarly, the transition from editing a Word document to opening and interacting with a PDF in Adobe Acrobat represents an endpoint for document conversion and review. Cases were defined to represent coherent work units such as drafting sections of a report, composing and sending emails, processing budget data, and finalizing deliverable documents.

**Activity Naming:**  
Lower-level actions like "TYPING" or "SWITCH" were generalized into more descriptive high-level activities such as "Draft Introduction Paragraph," "Save Document," "Highlight Key Findings," and "Focus on PDF." This standardization enables clearer understanding and easier querying by process mining tools. Activities were organized according to the business process, such as document editing, email communication, data manipulation in Excel, and report generation in Word.

**Event Attributes:**  
Each event is tagged with a **Case ID** to distinguish instances within the same process, **Activity Name** for clarity, **Timestamp** for chronological understanding, and additional attributes (like **Details** and **App**) for capturing the context of each action. This structure supports analysis and filtering based on different dimensions of user activity.

This transformation provides a process mining-ready event log that can be used to analyze user behavior, workflow efficiency, and identify bottlenecks or redundant activities across user work sessions.
