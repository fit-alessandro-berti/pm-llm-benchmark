Analyzing the process variants of both the "protected" and "unprotected" groups in a tenant screening and rental scenario reveals several key differences that could indicate potential unfair treatment and inherent biases in the process. Let’s examine these differences critically:

1. **Frequency of Rejection**:
   - **Protected Group**: The protected group experiences more explicit rejection shortly after the initial steps like "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant." This can indicate a bias or a quicker rejection rate in the early stages of the application process.
   - **Unprotected Group**: While the unprotected group also faces rejections (e.g., "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant"), the variants with early rejections seem less frequent than the protected group.

2. **Extensive Screening**:
   - **Protected Group**: The frequency and the complexity involved in the variants with "Extensive Screening" are very notable, often resulting in rejection. It seems the protected group is subjected to more rigorous scrutiny, which perhaps unnecessarily prolongs the process or serves as a gatekeeping mechanism.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Although extensive screening is also present, it leads to a contract signing more often compared to outright rejection seen in the protected group. This indicates a potentially more favorable outcome from the screening process.

3. **Path to Contract and Tenant Stability**:
   - **Protected Group**: Fewer variants lead to the signing of a contract, moving in, and longer rental periods (indicated by multiple "Pay Rent" iterations). This might suggest issues with sustained tenant stability or hurdles in reaching the contract stage.
   - **Unprotected Group**: There appears to be a more straightforward and successful path towards signing a contract and longer tenancy periods. More variants lead to several iterations of "Pay Rent," indicating longer stable tenancies observed.

4. **Performance Time (Execution Time)**:
   - **Protected Group**: Longer performance times in certain nodes suggest potentially slower processing times, which could be due to either the complexity of the processes (like extensive screening) or less efficient handling of applications.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Generally, the unprotected group shows somewhat balanced performance times, but it’s crucial to note that faster processing does not imply a bias unless coupled with unfavorable outcomes.

5. **Outcome Diversity**:
   - **Protected Group**: The presence of outcomes like "Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant" highlights the possible hardships or challenges faced by the tenants after moving in, which isn't prominent in the unprotected group’s data.
   - **Unprotected Group**: The range of outcomes mainly revolves around sustained tenancies and regular rental payments, suggesting possibly better tenant management or support.

**Conclusion**:
The main differences highlight potential disparities in how the protected and unprotected groups are treated throughout the tenant application and management process. The protected group faces more stringent checks, quicker rejections, and possibly less support or efficiency leading to tenancy sustainability. These differences could be indicative of underlying systemic biases that need addressing to ensure fairness and equal treatment across all applicant groups. Further quantitative analysis might involve specific statistical tests for discrimination and bias measurement (like adverse impact ratio, disparate impact analysis, etc.) to bolster these observations.
