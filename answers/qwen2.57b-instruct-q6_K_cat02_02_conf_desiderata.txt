### 1. Violations of Normative Rules

**Case ID: 2**
- **Reason:** The case violates the normative rules by performing a Risk Assessment before completing the Credit Check. According to the sequence, Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.

### 2. Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions

**Case ID: 1**
- **Reasons:**
  - Finalize Documentation was performed after the loan was rejected (not allowed).
  
**Case ID: 3**
- **Reasons:**
  - The Credit Check took more than 24 hours to complete (a desideratum violation, though not a strict rule).
  - The Inform Applicant step occurred more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision (a desideratum violation, though not a strict rule).

### Interpretations and Justifications

**Case ID: 1**
- **Justification for Violation:** It is possible that there was an internal processing delay or an error in tracking which led to Finalize Documentation being completed after the loan rejection. This could be due to a system issue, human oversight, or other technical constraints.
  
**Case ID: 3**
- **Justification for Credit Check Delay:** The extended time between Application Received and Credit Check (2 days) might indicate that there was an external factor such as a processing queue backlog or a high volume of applications requiring manual intervention.
- **Justification for Inform Applicant Delay:** The delay in informing the applicant (2 days after Loan Decision) could be due to system maintenance, a communication failure, or other logistical challenges. It is important to address these issues to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
