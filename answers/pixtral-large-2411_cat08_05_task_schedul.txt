## Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### Reconstructing Job Flows and Execution Sequences

To analyze the scheduling performance, we start by reconstructing the job flows and execution sequences from the MES event logs. We can use **process discovery algorithms** like the Alpha algorithm or the Fuzzy Miner to generate a process model that visualizes the sequence of operations for different jobs. These models will showcase how jobs move through various machines, capturing the actual flow versus the planned flow.

### Key Process Mining Techniques and Metrics

1. **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
   - **Technique:** Use **case duration analysis** to measure the total time from job release to completion.
   - **Metrics:** Calculate lead times, flow times, and makespan for each job. Use statistical measures (mean, median, variance) to understand distributions.
   - **Tools:** Statistical analysis and visualization tools like histograms and box plots.

2. **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):**
   - **Technique:** Apply **queue time analysis** to measure the duration between the completion of one task and the start of the next.
   - **Metrics:** Average queue times at each work center, variability in queue times.
   - **Tools:** Gantt charts and queue time distribution plots.

3. **Resource Utilization:**
   - **Technique:** Perform **resource utilization analysis** to quantify productive time, idle time, and setup time.
   - **Metrics:** Machine and operator utilization rates, idle time percentages.
   - **Tools:** Resource utilization charts and time-series plots.

4. **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
   - **Technique:** Use **sequence-dependent setup time analysis** to quantify setup times based on job sequences.

5. **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
   - **Technique:** Conduct **schedule adherence analysis** to measure deviations from due dates.
   - **Metrics:** Tardiness frequency, average tardiness, on-time delivery rates.
   - **Tools:** Tardiness distribution plots and on-time delivery charts.

## Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

### Identifying Key Pathologies

3. **Suboptimal Sequencing:**
   - **Analysis:** Use **sequence analysis** to identify inefficient job sequencing.
   - **Metrics:** Total setup times, sequence-dependent setup times.
   - **Evidence:** Increased setup times due to poor job sequencing.

4. **Resource Starvation:**
   - **Analysis:** Conduct **resource starvation analysis** to identify periods of idle downstream resources.
   - **Metrics:** Idle time percentages, resource utilization rates.
   - **Evidence:** High idle times for downstream machines.

   - **Analysis:** Use **WIP level analysis** to detect variability in inventory levels.
   - **Metrics:** WIP levels, variability in WIP.
   - **Evidence:** Significant fluctuations in WIP levels.

### Providing Evidence with Process Mining

- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Use process mining to visualize workflows and identify bottlenecks through resource utilization and queue time analysis.

## Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### Potential Root Causes
