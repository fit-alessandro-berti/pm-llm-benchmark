# Bias Analysis of the Loan Processing Event Log

## 1. Where Bias is Structurally Embedded

### A. The Community Group Score Adjustment

The most explicit bias mechanism is the **+10 "Community" score adjustment** applied exclusively to members of the Highland Civic Darts Club (C001, C004). This adjustment is:

- **Automatic** — applied at the PreliminaryScoring stage by the Scoring Engine without case-by-case justification
- **Membership-dependent** — tied to a specific named social organization, not to any financial behavior
- **Compounding** — it carries forward through ManualReview and FinalDecision, shaping every subsequent evaluation

| Case | Base Score | Adjustment | Final Score | Local? | Community Group | Decision |
|------|-----------|------------|------------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| C001 | 710 | +10 | 720 | TRUE | Highland Civic Darts Club | **Approved** |
| C002 | 720 | 0 | 720 | TRUE | None | **Approved** |
| C003 | 715 | 0 | 715 | FALSE | None | **Rejected** |
| C004 | 690 | +10 | 700 | TRUE | Highland Civic Darts Club | **Approved** |
| C005 | 740 | 0 | 740 | FALSE | None | **Approved** |

## 2. The Critical Equity Failure: C003 vs. C004

This comparison is the most damning illustration of inequity in the dataset:

> **C003** has a preliminary score of **715** — 25 points higher than C004's base score of 690 — yet is **Rejected**, while **C004**, with genuinely weaker underlying creditworthiness, is **Approved**.

The sole operative difference is club membership and local residency. This means the process is approving applicants with *objectively lower financial merit* over those with *higher merit* based purely on social and geographic affiliations. This is not a marginal edge case — it is a systematic inversion of the stated purpose of credit scoring.

## 3. The Local Residency Dimension

The `LocalResident` attribute does not explicitly generate a score adjustment, but a troubling pattern emerges:

- Every non-local resident (C003, C005) belongs to **no community group** and receives **no adjustment**
- Every community group member is also a local resident
- C003 (non-local, no group, score 715) is rejected while C004 (local, group member, score 690700) is approved

This raises a critical structural question: **Is local residency functioning as a gatekeeping variable** — determining eligibility for the community bonus and possibly influencing underwriter disposition — even without appearing as a formal score input? The correlation is perfect within this dataset and warrants serious scrutiny.

## 4. Manual Review Does Not Correct the Bias

Manual review (by human underwriters) had an opportunity to identify and correct score inflation from community affiliation. Instead:

| Case | Reviewer | Score at Review | Action Taken |
|------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| C001 | Reviewer #7 | 720 (Adjusted) | Passed through — Approved |
| C003 | Reviewer #4 | 715 (No adjustment) | Passed through — **Rejected** |
| C004 | Reviewer #2 | 700 (Adjusted) | Passed through — Approved |

The reviewers appear to treat the adjusted scores as given rather than interrogating **why** two applicants with similar or lower base scores are being treated so differently. This represents a failure of human oversight to serve as a fairness checkpoint — the bias is laundered through the automated scoring stage and accepted uncritically downstream.

## 5. Proxy Discrimination and Protected-Class Risk

The community group and residency criteria carry significant risk of functioning as **proxies for protected characteristics**:

- **Club membership** (Highland Civic Darts Club) may correlate with race, ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic class — people who are excluded from such networks by historical or structural barriers receive no equivalent benefit
- **Local residency** may correlate with national origin or immigration status, creating indirect discrimination against applicants who are equally or more creditworthy but geographically or socially outside the favored network
- The bonus rewards **social capital** — who you know, where you live, what clubs you join — rather than **financial behavior**, which is the legitimate basis for credit decisions

Under fair lending frameworks (e.g., disparate impact doctrine), the legality of such adjustments would depend on whether the institution can demonstrate that community group membership is *empirically predictive* of repayment behavior. The event log provides no such evidence.

## 6. Summary of Bias Vectors

| Bias Type | Mechanism | Who Is Harmed |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Score inflation** | +10 for club membership | Non-members with equal/better credit |
| **Threshold manipulation** | Adjusted scores cross approval cutoffs | Applicants without social affiliations |
| **Geographic preference** | LocalResident correlates with all benefits | Non-residents regardless of creditworthiness |
| **Automation bias** | Reviewers accept adjusted scores uncritically | Anyone disadvantaged by the adjustment formula |
| **Proxy discrimination** | Club/residency as stand-ins for protected traits | Potentially race, national origin, class |

## Recommendations

1. **Remove non-financial score adjustments** unless empirically validated against default rates with transparent methodology
2. **Audit the decision threshold** to determine why C004 (700) was approved while C003 (715) was rejected — if residency is informally influencing the threshold, that must be disclosed and justified
3. **Mandate reviewer accountability** for cases where adjusted scores differ materially from base scores
4. **Test for disparate impact** by analyzing approval rates by residency status and community affiliation across a larger dataset
5. **Document the justification** for any group-based adjustments, with regular fairness audits

The core problem is this: the process **conflates social belonging with creditworthiness**, systematically rewarding applicants for attributes that have no transparent relationship to their ability to repay, while penalizing equally or more qualified individuals who simply lack the right affiliations.
