### **Analysis of Bias in the Process**  

The event log suggests potential **biases** in the approval process, particularly in how **community affiliation** and **local residency** impact the final decision. Below are key observations:

---

### **1. Community Group Bias (Favoring Affiliated Applicants)**
- Applicants affiliated with **Highland Civic Darts Club** (C001, C004) received a **+10 score adjustment** in Preliminary Scoring.
- This directly increased their chances of approval.
- In contrast, applicants without a community group (C002, C003, C005) did not receive any score adjustment.

ðŸ’¡ **Implication:**  
This practice **unfairly advantages applicants** associated with specific community groups, even when their original scores are similar to or lower than others. Individuals who are not part of a recognized community group may be disadvantaged despite having equal financial profiles.

---

### **2. Local Resident Advantage**
- **Local residents (TRUE)** were approved even with lower scores:  
  - **C004 (Score 700, Approved)**  
  - **C001 (Score 720, Approved)**
- **Non-local applicants (FALSE)** faced stricter evaluations:  
  - **C003 (Score 715, Rejected)**  
  - **C005 (Score 740, Approved)**  

ðŸ’¡ **Implication:**  
Applicants who **do not live locally** seem to face a **higher likelihood of rejection** (C003 was rejected with a score of 715, while C004 was approved with 700). This suggests **geographic bias**, which may reduce fairness for individuals outside specific regions.

---

### **3. Approval Inconsistency (Threshold Differences)**
- **Applicant C003 (Score 715, Non-Local) was rejected.**
- **Applicant C004 (Score 700, Local with Community Affiliation) was approved.**
- This suggests that **a 700 score is "good enough" for approval** if the applicant is **local and in a community group**, but **a 715 score isn't sufficient if the applicant lacks those advantages**.

ðŸ’¡ **Implication:**  
Approval criteria **are not applied consistently**. Instead of a universal creditworthiness threshold, **subjective factors (location, community ties) play a role**, potentially leading to **discriminatory outcomes**.

---

### **Potential Unfairness & Equity Concerns**
1. **Exclusionary Effects** â€“ People who are not members of specific community groups face a **systematic disadvantage**.
2. **Geographic Discrimination** â€“ Non-local applicants appear to require **higher scores** for approval, which may **unfairly penalize individuals from different regions**.
3. **Lack of Transparency** â€“ The **manual review process** lacks clear, standardized criteria, allowing for potential **implicit biases** in decision-making.

---

### **How to Improve Fairness**
âœ” **Remove Community-Based Score Adjustments** â€“ Base approvals purely on financial data, not affiliations.  
âœ” **Standardize Score Thresholds** â€“ Ensure that approval decisions do not vary based on location or group membership.  
âœ” **Audit Manual Review Decisions** â€“ Track how often local vs. non-local applicants are rejected despite similar scores.  
âœ” **Ensure Transparency** â€“ Clearly define **objective approval criteria** that do not rely on subjective factors like community ties.

### **Final Thought**
While supporting local communities is valuable, **embedding community affiliation and residency into financial decisions introduces biases that undermine fairness**. A more **equitable system would assess all applicants purely on financial merit** without privileging specific groups.
