| **HA1**                   | **Material Preparation**                    | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet | Initial preparation of the material for processing, sequential and temporally close, same resource type (mostly Operator A and automated units for alignment and preheating) |
| **HA2**                   | **Welding Operation**                       | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B                                  | Sequential, tool pickup followed by direct actions, same resource (Operator B)               |
| **HA3**                   | **Quality Assurance - Weld Integrity**    | Measure weld integrity                                                   | Standalone quality check post-welding, distinct resource (Quality Sensor #1)                 |
| **HA4**                   | **Protective Coating Application**        | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                                          | Sequential coating process, distinct automated units (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2) |
| **HA5**                   | **Final Quality Check**                     | Visual check                                                                 | Final, standalone quality assurance step, different resource (Operator C)                  |

#### **Detailed Justification and Rationale for Each Grouping**

##### **HA1 - Material Preparation**
- **Included Activities:** Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet
- **Justification:** These activities are the initial steps in preparing the material for the manufacturing process. They are temporally close, often performed by the same or similar types of resources (Operator A for the first three, then automated units for alignment and preheating), and logically lead into the next stages of production. The proximity in time and the sequential nature (retrieval, preparation, and setup for processing) justify their grouping.

##### **HA2 - Welding Operation**
- **Included Activities:** Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B
- **Justification:** The pickup of the welding tool is a prerequisite for the welding actions. These activities are sequential, performed by the same resource (Operator B), and represent a distinct phase of adding value to the product (assembly through welding).

##### **HA3 - Quality Assurance - Weld Integrity**
- **Included Activities:** Measure weld integrity
- **Justification:** This is a standalone quality check that occurs after the welding operation, using a dedicated resource (Quality Sensor #1). It serves as a distinct quality assurance step, justifying its separation from the welding operation itself.

##### **HA4 - Protective Coating Application**
- **Included Activities:** Apply protective coating, Dry coating
- **Justification:** These activities are sequential and represent a complete process of applying and then drying the coating, performed by specialized automated units. They logically follow quality checks and prepare the product for final inspection.

##### **HA5 - Final Quality Check**
- **Included Activities:** Visual check
- **Justification:** The visual check is a final, standalone quality assurance step performed by a different resource (Operator C), indicating a conclusion of the manufacturing process before the product is considered complete.
