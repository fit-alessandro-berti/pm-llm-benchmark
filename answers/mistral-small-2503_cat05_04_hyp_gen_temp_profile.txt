### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive (R) to Approve (P):**
   - **Average Time:** ~25 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour
   - **Anomaly:** The very low standard deviation suggests a rigid, possibly artificial schedule for approval that does not align with typical business processes.

2. **Approve (P) to Notify (N):**
   - **Average Time:** 7 days
   - **Standard Deviation:** 2 days
   - **Anomaly:** The long average delay and high standard deviation indicate inconsistent notification times, possibly due to internal backlog or resource constraints.

3. **Assign (A) to Close (C):**
   - **Average Time:** 2 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour
   - **Anomaly:** The quick closure after assignment without consistent intermediate steps (like Evaluate or Approve) suggests some claims might be prematurely closed.

4. **Evaluate (E) to Notify (N):**
   - **Average Time:** 5 minutes
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute
   - **Anomaly:** The extremely short time between evaluation and notification suggests a too-quick transition, potentially skipping necessary checks.

### Hypotheses on the Causes of Anomalies

1. **Systemic Delays:**
   - **Manual Data Entry:** Delays in manual data entry processes could cause large time gaps between activities.
   - **Automated Steps:** Automated processes might be configured to execute too rapidly, skipping necessary checks or reviews.

2. **Bottlenecks:**
   - **Resource Constraints:** Inconsistent resource availability (e.g., adjusters) could lead to irregular timing patterns.
   - **Internal Backlog:** High volumes of claims might cause delays in certain activities, particularly in the notification phase.

3. **Inconsistent Processes:**
   - **Premature Closure:** Some claims might be closed prematurely due to miscommunication or oversight.
   - **Skipping Steps:** Certain steps might be skipped due to inefficiencies or shortcuts taken by staff.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **Identify Claims with Anomalous Timing:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce1.claim_id,
       ce1.activity AS activity1,
       ce2.activity AS activity2,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff
   FROM
       claim_events ce1
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE
       (ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P') OR
       (ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N') OR
       (ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C') OR
       (ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N')
   ORDER BY
       ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp;
   ```

2. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters or Resources:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce1.claim_id,
       ce1.resource,
       ce1.activity AS activity1,
       ce2.activity AS activity2,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff
   FROM
       claim_events ce1
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE
       (ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P') OR
       (ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N') OR
       (ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C') OR
       (ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N')
   ORDER BY
       ce1.resource, ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp;
   ```

3. **Filter by Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce1.claim_id,
       ce1.resource,
       ce1.activity AS activity1,
       ce2.activity AS activity2,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff
   FROM
       claim_events ce1
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE
       ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
       AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 7200
   ORDER BY
       ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp;
   ```

4. **Filter by Claims with Excessively Long Approval to Notification Time:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce1.claim_id,
       ce1.resource,
       ce1.activity AS activity1,
       ce2.activity AS activity2,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff
   FROM
       claim_events ce1
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE
       ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
       AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 604800
   ORDER BY
       ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp;
   ```

These queries will help identify specific claims and resources associated with the anomalies, providing insights into potential process inefficiencies or irregularities.
