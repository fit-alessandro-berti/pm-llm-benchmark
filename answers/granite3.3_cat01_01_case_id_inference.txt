To group these events logically into distinct cases without explicit case identifiers, we need to analyze the sequence based on the following attributes: 

1. **Patient Identifiers**: Although no direct patient ID is present, we can use unique combinations of `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and potentially `insurance` (though not all entries have this) as potential identifiers since these details are unlikely to change during a single hospital visit.
   
2. **Department Changes** indicate a shift in cases as they suggest different medical needs. 

3. **Sequential Activities**: Following the logical progression of patient care, we can infer case transitions based on related activities (e.g., registration followed by triage, tests, consultations leading to treatments).

Analyzing the provided sequence, here’s how events could be logically grouped:

**Case 1:**
- **Initial Patient**: Age 45, Male, Private Insurance
  - Event 1: Register patient (ER)
  - Event 4: Initial triage (ER), Triage code 3
  - Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology)
  - Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER), Diagnosis: Hairline fracture
  - Event 30: Patient discharged (ER), Followup: Outpatient clinic

**Case 2:**
- **Initial Patient**: Age 62, Female, Public Insurance
  - Event 2: Register patient (ER)
  - Event 5: Initial triage (ER), Triage code 2
  - Event 9: Lab test requested (ER)
  - Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER), Diagnosis: Minor infection
  - Event 17: Patient discharged (ER), Followup: Pharmacy pickup

**Case 3:**
- **Initial Patient**: Age 28, Male, Private Insurance
  - Event 3: Register patient (Surgery)
  - Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery), Reason: Scheduled knee surgery
  - Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery)
  - Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery), Procedure: Arthroscopy
  - Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery), Condition: Stable
  - Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery), Followup: Physiotherapy sessions

Each case is identifiable by a unique combination of patient characteristics and department-specific activities, allowing for logical grouping even without explicit case IDs. This analysis respects the sequence of events typical in patient care flow—registration, triage, diagnostic tests, consultations, treatments, and discharge.
