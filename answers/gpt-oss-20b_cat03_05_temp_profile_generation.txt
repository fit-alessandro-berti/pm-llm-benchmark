We need to produce a Python dictionary representing temporal profile for the supply chain process. We should include pairs of activities that appear in the process, not only directly connected but eventually following each other. Provide estimated average time and standard deviation. Should not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt? Wait: The instruction says "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." But we are generating output; we can give numbers? The scenario says "Your task: Produce a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile. For each pair of activities that appear ... assign an estimated average time and standard deviation." So we need to give numbers. The earlier instruction about "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt" refers to earlier part of conversation? Actually it's part of instructions: "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." That might mean that when writing prompts for LLM, don't give numeric times; but here we are generating answer with numeric estimates.

Thus produce dictionary with some pairs and values like (average_time_in_seconds, std_dev). Provide representative subset including direct and indirect pairs.

We need to ensure complexity by including pairs separated by multiple steps.

Let's list activities:

SS
OP
RC
QI
CA
PT
PK
WS
DT
AS

We can create dictionary keys for many combinations:

Direct neighbors:
('SS','OP'), ('OP','RC'), ('RC','QI'), ('QI','CA'), ('CA','PT'), ('PT','PK'), ('PK','WS'), ('WS','DT'), ('DT','AS')

Also some indirect:
('SS', 'RC') (skip OP)
('SS', 'QI')
('SS', 'CA')
...
Also maybe include all pairs where first precedes second in trace order.

But we can choose subset.

Let's produce maybe 15-20 entries.

For each pair assign average_time e.g., days/hours etc. Use seconds units.

Examples:

('SS', 'OP'): 86400 (1 day)
std dev 7200

('OP', 'RC'): 172800 (2 days)
std dev 14400

('RC', 'QI'): 43200 (12 hours)
std dev 3600

('QI', 'CA'): 86400 (1 day)
std dev 7200

('CA', 'PT'): 28800 (8 hours)
std dev 3600

('PT', 'PK'): 21600 (6 hours)
std dev 1800

('PK', 'WS'): 86400*7 =604800? Actually storage maybe variable; let's set avg=604800 seconds (~7 days) std=432000?

But maybe simpler: use realistic values but arbitrary.

Also include indirect:

('SS','RC') avg=259200 sec(3 days) std=21600

...

Ok produce dictionary with keys as tuples strings or actual tuples? Use tuple of strings e.g., ("SS","OP").

Return python dict literal with entries separated by commas inside braces. Ensure formatting correct python code block markdown language python.

Let's craft final answer accordingly.

Below is a **representative** subset of a temporal‑profile dictionary for the described supply‑chain process.
The values are *illustrative* averages and standard deviations expressed in **seconds** – they capture typical lead‑times between any two activities that ever occur one after another within a trace, even if several intermediate steps intervene.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly consecutive activities ------------------------------------
    ("SS", "OP"):   (86_400,   7_200),   # Supplier selection → Order placement (~1 day ±2 h)
    ("OP", "RC"):   (172_800, 14_400),   # Order placement → Receive components (~2 days ±4 h)
    ("RC", "QI"):   (43_200,     3_600), # Receive components → Quality inspection (~12 h ±1 h)
    ("QI", "CA"):   (86_400,     7_200), # Quality inspection → Component assembly (~1 day ±2 h)
    ("CA", "PT"):   (28_800,     3_600), # Component assembly → Product testing (~8 h ±1 h)
    ("PT", "PK"):   (21_600,     1_800), # Product testing → Packaging (~6 h ±30 min)
    ("PK", "WS"):   (604_800,  432_000),# Packaging → Warehouse storage (~7 days ±5 days) 
    ("WS", "DT"):   (86_400*5 ,36_000 ),# Warehouse storage → Distribution (~5 days ±10 hrs) 
    ("DT", "AS"):   (-1 , -1 ),          # Distribution → After‑sales support – no fixed delay  

    # Indirectly related activity pairs ----------------------------------
    ("SS", "RC"):      (259200 ,21600 ),# SS→ RC via OP (~3 days ±6 hrs) 
    ("SS", "QI"):      (-1 , -1 ),      # SS→ QI via OP→ RC – no fixed delay  
    ("OP", "QA") :     (-1 , -1 ),
    
}
```

> **Notes**
> * `(-1 , -1)` is used where there is no meaningful or consistent time gap between two events because they are rarely observed consecutively or their separation depends entirely on external factors.
> * All times are rounded to whole seconds for clarity; real implementations would likely use floating‑point precision.
> * This subset demonstrates how you can extend it further—simply add more `(activity_a, activity_b)` keys covering every pair that appears sequentially across your event logs.*
