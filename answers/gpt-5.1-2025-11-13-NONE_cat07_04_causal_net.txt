The visualization shows a **business process model as a Petri net** for handling a customer request, together with a legend explaining different gateway types.

### Main process (left/top)

- **Places** are small black circles; **transitions (activities)** are rounded rectangles with labels.
- Arcs connect circles and rectangles, defining the flow of tokens (control).

Activities:

1. **a – register request**: starting activity.
2. After registration the case can go to one or more of:
   - **b – examine thoroughly**
   - **c – examine casually**
   - **d – check ticket**
3. Based on these checks it moves to:
   - **e – decide**
4. Decision leads to either:
   - **g – pay compensation**
   - **h – reject request**
5. Both paths finally converge at:
   - **z – end**

There is also **f – reinitiate request**, connected back to earlier parts of the net, modeling a loop where a request can be sent back for rework.

The web of arcs between b, c, d, e, and f shows that these activities can occur in various orders and cycles, depending on token movement.

### Legend (bottom-right)

The shaded box explains how gateways are represented using Petri-net patterns:

- **XOR-split**: one incoming flow, one of several alternative outgoing flows.
- **AND-split**: one incoming, multiple parallel outgoing flows.
- **OR-split**: one incoming, one or more chosen outgoing flows.

- **XOR-join**: one of several incoming flows is sufficient to continue.
- **AND-join**: all incoming flows must be present before continuing.
- **OR-join**: one or more incoming flows may be synchronized to continue.

Each pattern is depicted as a rectangle with different combinations of incoming/outgoing circles and arcs, showing how standard process-logic constructs are encoded in Petri nets.
