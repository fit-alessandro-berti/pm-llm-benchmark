### Analysis of Bias in Event Logs

**1. Overview of Groups:**

- **Group A (Protected Group):** Consists of individuals who do not receive any community-related score adjustments or local residency benefits.
- **Group B (Unprotected Group):** Includes individuals who might receive a score adjustment due to community involvement or local residency.

**2. Key Observations:**

- **LocalResident and CommunityGroup Influence:**
  - **Group A:** None of the applicants are local residents or part of any community group, which leads to no score adjustments.
  - **Group B:** Several applicants are local residents, and some are members of community groups like the "Highland Civic Darts Club". This affiliation results in a positive score adjustment labeled as "Community Boost."

- **ScoreAdjustment:**
  - **Group A:** No score adjustments are applied throughout the process.
  - **Group B:** Adjustments are made, specifically a +10 point boost for those in community groups. This adjustment occurs during the PreliminaryScoring and ManualReview stages.

- **Decision Outcomes:**
  - **Group A:**
    - **P001:** Approved with a score of 720 (no adjustment).
    - **P002:** Rejected with a score of 710 (no adjustment).
    - **P003:** Approved with a score of 740 (no adjustment).
  - **Group B:**
    - **U001:** Approved with an adjusted score of 730 (from 720).
    - **U002:** Rejected with a score of 710 (no adjustment, but local resident).
    - **U003:** Approved with an adjusted score of 705 (from 695).

**3. Identification of Bias:**

- **Manifestation of Bias:**
  - The **ScoreAdjustment** in Group B introduces a systematic advantage for individuals who are part of community groups. This adjustment can lead to a higher approval rate for these individuals even if their initial scores are lower than those in Group A.

- **Bias Analysis:**
  - **Disparate Treatment:** The explicit adjustment of scores for community group members (Group B) constitutes a form of disparate treatment. Applicants in Group A do not receive any such benefits, which could be considered discriminatory if these adjustments are not justified by a legitimate business need.
  
  - **Impact on Decisions:** 
    - **U001** and **U003** from Group B received approvals after their scores were adjusted upwards by 10 points. Without this adjustment, U001 would have had the same score as P001 from Group A, but P001 had to meet a higher threshold to get approved.
    - **U002** was rejected despite being a local resident, indicating that local residency alone might not be sufficient without community group involvement for score adjustment.

**4. Discussion on Systematic Differences:**

- **Systematic Advantage:** The community group membership provides a systematic advantage in the approval process. This could lead to a higher acceptance rate among unprotected group members who are involved in community activities, potentially skewing the fairness of the decision-making process.

- **Potential for Discrimination:** If there is an assumption or policy that community involvement reflects character or reliability, this might not always hold true, and it could disadvantage those in Group A who might not have the opportunity or inclination to participate in community groups but are otherwise qualified.

- **Policy Review:** The organization should review whether the Community Boost is:
  - Based on a legitimate business need or if it's inadvertently creating a bias against non-local or non-community-involved applicants.
  - Properly documented and justified in policy to ensure transparency and fairness.

**Conclusion:**

The event log for **Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits bias through the application of score adjustments for community group members, which is not extended to **Group A (Protected Group)**. This practice could lead to discriminatory outcomes unless there is a clear, fair rationale behind these adjustments that directly correlates with the objective criteria for approval. The organization should assess whether such adjustments are necessary, how they are applied, and ensure they do not inadvertently disadvantage any group.
