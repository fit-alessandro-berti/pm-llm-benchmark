This comprehensive event log integrates data from all provided tables. Activities are derived based on the timestamps available in the respective lifecycle stages (creation, picking, delivery, invoicing, and payment).

### Assumptions Made:
1.  **Resource Mapping:** Resource IDs (like `SP-001`, `WH-001`) were mapped to human-readable names using the `Resources Table`. For payment events where no specific actor is listed, the Resource is tagged as **"Finance System"**.
2.  **Granularity for Picking:** Since item picking occurs at different times for different items within the same order, a separate "Item Picked" event is created for every line item in the `Order Lines` table to capture detailed execution timing and resources.
3.  **Granularity for Delivery:** Each entry in the `Delivery Table` generates two distinct events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived." The carrier (`carrier_id`) is used as the resource for both.
4.  **Order 1004:** This order only has creation and picking data. The log accurately reflects that no subsequent invoicing or payment events were recorded for this case ID.
