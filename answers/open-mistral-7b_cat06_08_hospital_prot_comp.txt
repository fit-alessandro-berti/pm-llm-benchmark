To identify the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we can analyze the frequency and execution time of each process variant.

1. Frequency:
   - The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency for the process variants that involve expert examination and thorough examination, such as 'Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge' and 'Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge'. This suggests that the 'unprotected' group is more likely to undergo these types of examinations.
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency for the variant 'Register at ER' and 'Register at FD', which suggests that they are more likely to start the treatment process without going through expert or thorough examination.

2. Execution Time:
   - The 'protected' group has a lower average execution time for most of the process variants, especially those that do not involve expert or thorough examination. This suggests that the treatment process for the 'protected' group is generally faster than that for the 'unprotected' group.
   - The 'unprotected' group has a higher average execution time for the variants that involve expert examination or thorough examination, such as 'Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge' and 'Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge'. This suggests that the treatment process for these variants is more complex and time-consuming for the 'unprotected' group.

3. Other Observations:
   - The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency for variants that involve treatment unsuccessful, followed by successful treatment. This suggests that the 'unprotected' group may have more complicated cases that require more attempts at treatment.
   - The 'protected' group has a variant 'Register at ER ( frequency = 158  performance = 0.000 )' with zero execution time, which is not present in the 'unprotected' group. This suggests that there is a difference in the way the 'protected' group is registered or processed at the ER.

These differences could suggest unfair treatment, but further investigation would be needed to determine the cause of these differences. It could be due to factors such as discrimination, resource allocation, or differing medical needs between the two groups.
