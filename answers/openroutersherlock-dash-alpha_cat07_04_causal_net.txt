This is a flowchart diagram illustrating a **ticket/request processing workflow** with decision points and parallel processing paths, accompanied by icons for common splitting/joining patterns in workflow design. Here's a breakdown:

## Main Workflow (Left Side)
- **Entry**: Starts with **[a] register request**  flows into multiple examination paths.
- **Examination Branches**:
  - **Casual exam [c]**  **[d] ticket**  loops back or continues.
  - **Thorough exam [b]**  connects centrally.
- **Decision Point [e]**: "decide"  splits into:
  - **Pay compensation [g]**  **[z] end**.
  - **Request [h]**  "reject request"  **[z] end**.
- **Other Paths**:
  - **[f] reinitialate request** loops back.
  - Direct **[reject request]** from initial paths.

## Workflow Patterns (Right Side)
Four illustrated splitting/joining patterns (with node icons):
```
XOR-split  XOR-join    AND-split  AND-join
                 
OR-split   OR-join     (parallel paths)
                 
```

**Key Features**:
- **Decision diamonds** (/) for splits (XOR/OR/AND logic).
- **Synchronization bars** (/) for joins.
- Emphasizes **parallel processing** (AND-split/join) vs. **exclusive routing** (XOR).
- Typical BPMN/workflow notation for request approval/rejection with compensation flows.

The diagram models a **business process** like customer support tickets, with routing based on examination outcomes.
