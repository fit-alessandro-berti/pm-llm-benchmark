To transform the raw system log into a process mining event log, we need to follow these key steps:

1. **Case Identification**: Group related events based on the logical flow of user activities. For example, a case could be a set of actions related to a specific document, like editing "Document1.docx" or "Quarterly_Report.docx."

2. **Activity Naming**: Convert raw activities into higher-level actions that describe user work. For example, "FOCUS" translates to "Open Document," "TYPING" becomes "Edit Document," and so on.

3. **Event Attributes**: Include the Case ID (unique identifier for each work session), Activity Name (descriptive name of the task), Timestamp (from the log), and the relevant window or app context.

### Explanation of the Event Log:

- **Case ID:** I grouped activities into cases based on the document or task the user was working on. Each case represents a separate workflow or task. For instance, Case 1 contains all activities related to "Document1.docx," Case 2 represents the work on "Budget_2024.xlsx," and Case 3 is for the "Quarterly_Report.docx."
  
- **Activity Name:** I mapped the raw actions in the system log to higher-level activities. For example:
  - "FOCUS" -> "Open Document" (indicating the user started working on a document or window)
  - "TYPING" -> "Edit Document" (showing the user made edits to a document)
  - "SAVE" -> "Save Document" (the user saved the document)
  - "SWITCH" -> "Switch to [App]" (indicating a change between applications or windows)
  - "CLICK" -> "Read Email," "Reply to Email," "Send Email" (interpreted based on the action context)
  - "SCROLL" and "HIGHLIGHT" are interpreted based on their function (e.g., "Scroll Email" or "Highlight Text" for reading a PDF).
  
- **Timestamp:** The timestamp from the raw log is preserved for temporal analysis.

This structured log now represents the user's activities with clear cases and activities, ready for process mining analysis to understand how time is spent across tasks and workflows.
