This visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that outlines how a company processes a customer order from start to finish. It is composed of multiple lanes (horizontal bands), each representing a different department or role (such as Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse). The diagram shows the flow of work through these departments, the decisions that need to be made, and the interactions among them. Here’s what’s happening step by step:

1. **Sales Lane**:  
   - **Trigger:** The process starts with the arrival of a customer’s order.  
   - **Check Order for Completeness:** Sales verifies if the order is properly filled out and contains all the necessary details.  
   - **Check Customer in Database:** If the customer is new, the process involves adding their information to the company’s customer database. If they are already registered, this step is skipped.  
   - **Result:** After ensuring the order is ready and the customer is in the system, Sales sends the order details onward and drafts an invoice.

2. **Production Lane**:  
   - **Receive Order Details:** Once the order details are passed from Sales, Production starts planning how and when to create the product.  
   - **Plan Production:** The production team schedules the manufacturing process, considering resource availability and timelines.  
   - **Manufacture Product:** When the required materials are available and confirmed to be of good quality (as indicated by a successful materials check from Procurement), the product is manufactured.  
   - **Outcome:** A completed product is prepared for the Warehouse to ship.

3. **Procurement Lane**:  
   - **Material Compensation Subprocess:** If the production team needs materials, a subprocess is triggered in Procurement.  
   - **Order Materials:** Procurement orders the necessary raw materials from suppliers.  
   - **Check Materials:** Once materials arrive, they are inspected. If they are faulty, the materials are returned, and the order may be canceled. If they pass inspection, they are sent to the production team.  
   - **Integration with Production:** Only after the materials are confirmed good can Production proceed with manufacturing.

4. **Warehouse Lane**:  
   - **Receive Completed Product:** Once Production finishes, the product is passed on to the Warehouse.  
   - **Send Product:** The Warehouse packs and ships the product to the customer. The completion of this step confirms that the product is “sent” and the order fulfillment process is complete.

**Overall Flow**:  
- The initial action starts in Sales (verifying order details and customer information), moves into Production (to plan and manufacture), then engages Procurement (for materials if needed), before concluding with Warehouse (shipment to the customer).  
- Along the way, gateways (diamond shapes) represent decision points—such as whether the customer exists in the database or if the materials are good.  
- The solid black lines represent the primary process steps, while dashed lines represent the passing of information between departments.  
- Icons like the database symbol indicate data stores (like a customer database), and envelope icons represent messages or documents being passed along (like order details or shipping notices).

In summary, this BPMN diagram visually maps out the logical sequence of events and departmental handoffs required to complete a customer order—beginning with order entry, moving through production and procurement, and ending with the warehouse dispatching the finished product.
