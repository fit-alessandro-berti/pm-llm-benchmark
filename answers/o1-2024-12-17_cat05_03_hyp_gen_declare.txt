**1. Identifying the Anomalies**

- **Contradiction Between “existence” and “noncoexistence”:**  
  The model’s `existence` rule demands that the activity **C (Close Claim)** always occurs. However, the `noncoexistence` rule states that activity **E (Evaluate Claim)** cannot co-exist with **C**. This leads to a direct conflict: if **C** must always be present, then **E** is effectively prohibited because they cannot appear together. This contradicts typical claims processes where evaluation (E) is expected before closure (C).

- **Misalignment of “responded_existence” and the Business Flow:**  
  The `responded_existence` constraint indicates that if **E (Evaluate Claim)** is present, then **A (Assign Adjuster)** must also occur. Under normal business logic, “assign” should precede “evaluate.” However, due to the previous contradiction, **E** can never legitimately appear, rendering the requirement for **A** when **E** is present moot. This implies that the intended dependency between A and E is undermined.

- **Process Steps Are Skipped or Rendered Useless:**  
  Given the model as stated, the process can theoretically proceed directly from **R (Receive Claim)** to **C (Close Claim)** without any evaluation or assignment. The intended intermediate steps (assign, evaluate, approve, notify) are either not enforced or blocked by contradictory constraints, undermining the expected business logic and quality controls.

**2. Hypotheses for the Presence of Such Anomalies**

- **Misinterpretation of Requirements:**  
  The constraints may have been encoded incorrectly due to misunderstanding the real business requirements. Perhaps the intention was to ensure evaluation before closing, but the logic was reversed or mis-specified.

- **Partial Policy Updates Not Fully Propagated:**  
  There might have been incremental changes in the company’s policies. For example, a rule was introduced to ensure closure always happens, but the rule forbidding evaluation alongside closure was not updated or removed when policies changed.

- **Data or Technical Issues Leading to Erroneous Constraints:**  
  Incomplete or incorrect historical data used to derive the DECLARE model might have produced nonsensical rules. Automated discovery tools could have inferred noncoexistence from sparse or skewed data, resulting in contradictory constraints.

- **Operational Pressures and Ad-hoc Exceptions:**  
  Pressure to shorten claim handling times may have led to rules that bypass key steps, allowing closure without evaluation. Over time, these exceptions were encoded as constraints, contradicting standard quality and compliance expectations.

**3. Proposed SQL-Based Verification Approaches**

- **Check for Claims Closed Without Evaluation:**  
  This query identifies claims that reached the closing stage (**C**) but have no evaluation (**E**), confirming that the model’s contradictory allowance is occurring in practice.
  ```sql
  SELECT c.claim_id
  FROM claims c
  WHERE c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C'
  )
  AND c.claim_id NOT IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'E'
  );
  ```

- **Check for Coexistence of Evaluation and Closing:**  
  Despite the model prohibiting evaluation and closure together, this query detects any claims where both **E** and **C** occurred. Any returned results show a breach of the noncoexistence constraint.
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT e.claim_id
  FROM claim_events e
  JOIN claim_events c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
  WHERE e.activity = 'E'
    AND c.activity = 'C';
  ```

- **Validate the Assignment-Evaluation Dependency:**  
  This query ensures that whenever evaluation (**E**) occurs, there is a preceding assignment (**A**). If the model’s responded existence constraint is intended to mean E depends on A, this confirms or refutes that dependency in practice.
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT e.claim_id
  FROM claim_events e
  WHERE e.activity = 'E'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM claim_events a
      WHERE a.claim_id = e.claim_id
        AND a.activity = 'A'
        AND a.timestamp < e.timestamp
    );
  ```

- **Check for Adjuster Involvement in Evaluations:**  
  If evaluation should be carried out by an assigned adjuster, the following query tests whether evaluation steps always correspond to an appropriate resource with the necessary specialization. Any mismatch suggests that the constraints around assignment and evaluation are not functioning as intended.
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT e.claim_id, e.resource
  FROM claim_events e
  WHERE e.activity = 'E'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM claim_events a
      JOIN adjusters ad ON ad.adjuster_id = a.resource
      WHERE a.claim_id = e.claim_id
        AND a.activity = 'A'
        AND a.timestamp < e.timestamp
        AND ad.specialization = 'home' OR ad.specialization = 'auto'
    );
  ```

Each of these queries tests a different aspect of the contradictory model, helping to determine if the anomalies occur in practice and guiding subsequent refinement of the DECLARE constraints.
