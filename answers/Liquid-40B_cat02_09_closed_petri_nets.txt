Sure, here are the opposite and more general concepts for the given Petri net concepts:

1. Source Place: The opposite concept to a Source Place is a Sink Place. A Sink Place is a place that has no incoming transitions and only outgoing transitions. It is the place where tokens are consumed and removed from the system.

2. Immediate Transition: The more general concept to an Immediate Transition is a Transition. A Transition is a basic component of a Petri net that represents an event or action that can occur in the system. It can be immediate or non-immediate, depending on whether it has any input places with tokens.

3. Live Transition: The opposite concept to a Live Transition is a Dead Transition. A Dead Transition is a transition that cannot fire because it has no input places with tokens. It is a transition that is not reachable from the initial marking of the Petri net.

4. Bounded Net: The more general concept to a Bounded Net is a Petri Net. A Petri Net is a mathematical modeling language that is used to describe and analyze systems that have concurrent, asynchronous, and non-deterministic behavior. It consists of places, transitions, and arcs that connect them. A Bounded Net is a specific type of Petri Net where the number of tokens in each place is bounded.

5. Free Choice Net: The opposite concept to a Free Choice Net is a Forced Choice Net. A Forced Choice Net is a Petri Net where the choice of which transition to fire is not free, but is determined by the state of the system. In a Free Choice Net, the choice of which transition to fire is free, and can be made independently of the state of the system.
