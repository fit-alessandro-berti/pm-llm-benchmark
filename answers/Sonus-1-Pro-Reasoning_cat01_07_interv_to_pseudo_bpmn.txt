BPMN-like Textual Process Model for Invoice Approval
1. Start Event:
Trigger: Invoice arrives (via email)
2. Activities/Tasks:

3. Sequence Flow:

Check for PO Number → Send Back to Supplier for Details (if no PO number)
Check for PO Number → Log Invoice into System (if PO number present)
Log Invoice into System → Forward to Purchasing Department
Forward to Purchasing Department → Confirm Receipt of Goods
Confirm Receipt of Goods → Match Invoice to PO
Match Invoice to PO → Send Invoice to Department Manager for Approval (if match successful)
Match Invoice to PO → Email Purchasing Team to Clarify Discrepancy (if discrepancy exists)
Email Purchasing Team to Clarify Discrepancy → Resolve Discrepancy
Resolve Discrepancy → Send Invoice to Department Manager for Approval (if resolved)
Resolve Discrepancy → Escalate to Supervisor (if unresolved)
Escalate to Supervisor → Intervene to Resolve Issue
Intervene to Resolve Issue → Send Invoice to Department Manager for Approval (after resolution)
Send Invoice to Department Manager for Approval → Approve Invoice
Send Invoice to Department Manager for Approval → Reject or Hold Invoice for Further Investigation (if issues)
Reject or Hold Invoice for Further Investigation → Investigate Issues and Resolve
Investigate Issues and Resolve → Send Invoice to Department Manager for Approval (after resolution)
Approve Invoice → Schedule Invoice for Payment
4. Gateways/Decision Points:
Exclusive Gateway: Check for PO Number
Condition 1: PO number present → Log Invoice into System
Condition 2: No PO number → Send Back to Supplier for Details
Exclusive Gateway: Match Invoice to PO
Condition 1: Match successful → Send Invoice to Department Manager for Approval
Condition 2: Discrepancy exists → Email Purchasing Team to Clarify Discrepancy
Exclusive Gateway: Resolve Discrepancy
Condition 1: Discrepancy resolved → Send Invoice to Department Manager for Approval
Condition 2: Discrepancy unresolved → Escalate to Supervisor
Exclusive Gateway: Approve Invoice
Condition 1: Approval granted → Schedule Invoice for Payment
Condition 2: Approval rejected or held → Investigate Issues and Resolve
5. Roles/Participants:
Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
Purchasing Officer (Dan)
Department Manager (Carlos)
Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
Supplier
6. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:
Invoice
Purchase Order (PO)
Confirmation Email from Purchasing
Discrepancy Clarification Email
Approval Notification
Revised Invoice (if necessary)
Retrospective PO (if necessary)
7. Exceptions/Variations:
Missing PO Number: Invoice is sent back to the supplier for more details.
Discrepancies in Invoice: Invoice is held until discrepancies are resolved, which may involve escalation to the supervisor.
Unresolved Issues: Supervisor intervenes to resolve issues, which may involve creating a retrospective PO or rejecting the invoice.
Rejected or Held Invoices: Invoices are investigated and resolved before being sent back for approval.
Notes on Ambiguities and Variations:
Supplier Relationship Manager's Role: Karen is involved in resolving issues related to missing PO numbers or discrepancies but does not directly approve invoices. Her role is to facilitate communication with suppliers to resolve issues.
Retrospective POs: In cases where invoices lack POs, Rita works with department heads to create retrospective POs, which might involve additional steps not detailed in the interviews.
Payment Scheduling: The exact mechanism for scheduling payments isn't specified, but it's assumed to be handled by the Accounts Payable department after manager approval.
Communication Channels: Emails and system notifications are used for communication between departments and for triggering approval steps.
This textual process model captures the standard flow of the invoice approval process, including decision points, roles, and potential exceptions based on the interview excerpts provided.
