Process mining is a data-driven technique for analyzing, monitoring, and improving business processes using event logs. Within this field, three core concepts are widely used: process discovery, conformance checking, and process enhancement. Each serves distinct purposes in understanding and enhancing an organization's operational workflows.

### 1. Process Discovery

**Definition:** Process discovery involves creating a model of the process directly from historical event logs without any preconceived notion or knowledge about how the process should be. The goal is to automatically generate a Petri net, BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), or other graphical representations that reflect as closely as possible what happened in the past.

**Purpose:** This step identifies the actual execution paths of processes, the frequency of each path, potential bottlenecks, waiting times, and other process characteristics. It forms the basis for understanding how a process works when it's performed manually.

### 2. Conformance Checking

**Definition:** After discovering a process model, conformance checking assesses whether this model accurately reflects the execution captured in the event logs. This comparison involves checking if all activities in the logs can be mapped to the process model and verifying the sequence of activities based on time stamps.

**Purpose:** The primary goal here is to identify any discrepancies or deviations between the discovered process model and real-world execution. This helps in recognizing areas that are not well-documented, processes that have changed without updates being reflected in documentation, or where there might be inefficiencies due to non-conformant behavior.

### 3. Process Enhancement

**Definition:** Process enhancement is a step that aims to optimize the process based on the insights gained from discovery and conformance checking. It involves analyzing the results of both steps to identify potential improvements, such as eliminating redundant activities, streamlining sequences, or optimizing resource allocation.

**Purpose:** Unlike discovery and checking which are focused on understanding the past behavior of processes, process enhancement is forward-looking. Its main objective is to propose changes that could lead to more efficient, effective, and cost-saving operations. This might involve modifying the process model itself (e.g., changing task sequences or splitting complex tasks into simpler ones), implementing new controls to enforce best practices, or enhancing existing workflow management tools.

### Key Differences

- **Focus:** Process discovery is about understanding "what" happened in the past; conformance checking verifies if the "as-is" process aligns with historical data. In contrast, process enhancement focuses on suggesting and implementing changes to improve future process execution based on these insights.
  
- **Scope:** Discovery deals with creating a model from existing events, conformance checking checks if this model accurately represents reality. Enhancement involves taking corrective actions that may change the model itself or the underlying processes.

- **Outcome:** While discovery results in a clear picture of what was done, conformance checking provides validation on whether this aligns with expectations, and enhancement leads to actionable steps for improving process efficiency and effectiveness.

In summary, process mining's "process enhancement" is about leveraging data-driven insights from previous stages (discovery and checking) to make strategic improvements that can lead to significant operational gains. It bridges the gap between understanding past performance and driving forward-looking optimizations in business processes.
