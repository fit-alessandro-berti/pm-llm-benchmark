>  **Note:** All events are grouped under a single case (`CASE-01`) because they represent a coherent, sequential workflow involving the creation and refinement of a **quarterly business report**, including drafting, email communication, budget integration, and final review.

---

###  **Explanation of Logic**

#### **1. Case Identification: Why One Case?**
- The entire sequence of events follows a **logical, unified workflow** centered around the preparation of a **Quarterly Business Report**.
- The user starts with the main report (`Quarterly_Report.docx`), creates a draft (`Document1.docx`), integrates data from a budget spreadsheet (`Budget_2024.xlsx`), references it in the document, reviews a PDF version, and communicates via email about the annual meeting.
- All actions are temporally contiguous (within ~8 minutes), occur in a single session, and revolve around a single business goal: finalizing the report.
- The re-opening of `Quarterly_Report.docx` after closing the draft confirms that the user is continuing work on the same overarching document.
- Thus, **all events belong to one coherent case**: **"Finalizing the Quarterly Report"**.

#### **2. Activity Naming: From Raw Actions to Meaningful Steps**
We transformed low-level system events into high-level, process-oriented activities:
- `FOCUS`  `Start Editing`, `Switch to`, `Reopen`, `Return to` (contextualized based on window/app changes).
- `TYPING`  `Draft Introduction`, `Add Supporting Details`, `Type Email Response`, `Update Budget Figures`, `Insert Q2 Budget Row`, `Draft Executive Summary` — each captures the **intent** behind the typing.
- `SAVE`  `Save Draft Document`, `Save Updated Budget`, `Save Updated Document`, `Save Final Report Draft` — renamed for clarity and purpose.
- `SWITCH`  `Switch to Email App`, `Switch to PDF Review`, `Switch to Budget Data`, `Return to Document` — indicates **context shift** between work tasks.
- `CLICK`  `Open Email`, `Compose Reply`, `Send Email` — interpreted as **workflow steps** in email handling.
- `SCROLL`  `Review Email Content`, `Review Report Draft` — indicates **reading or scanning** behavior.
- `HIGHLIGHT`  `Highlight Key Findings` — captures intentional marking of content.
- `CLOSE`  `Close Draft Document`, `Close Final Report` — indicates **end of work on a sub-task**.

#### **3. Temporal and Contextual Coherence**
- The log shows **no break in workflow** or shift to unrelated tasks (e.g., no browsing, social media, or unrelated apps).
- All transitions are **purposeful**: from writing  email  reviewing  data entry  updating document  finalizing.
- The use of consistent document names (`Document1.docx`, `Quarterly_Report.docx`, `Report_Draft.pdf`, `Budget_2024.xlsx`) supports the inference that these are parts of a single project.

#### **4. Why Not Multiple Cases?**
- There is no evidence of separate projects or independent tasks (e.g., no distinct document names unrelated to the report).
- The user never starts a new document or task that diverges from the report lifecycle.
- Even though `Document1.docx` and `Quarterly_Report.docx` are different files, they are clearly part of the same report creation process (draft vs. final).

###  Final Summary

The transformed event log is a **coherent, analyst-ready process mining log** with:
- One logical **case** representing the full lifecycle of creating and finalizing a quarterly business report.
- **Standardized, meaningful activity names** that reflect user intent.
- **Temporal consistency** and **contextual accuracy**.
- All key attributes included: `Case ID`, `Activity Name`, `Timestamp`, `App`, `Window`, and optional `Notes`.

This log is now suitable for analysis with tools like **ProM**, **Celonis**, **UiPath Process Mining**, or **Disco**, enabling discovery of process variants, bottlenecks, conformance checking, and performance metrics (e.g., time spent on drafting, reviewing, or sending emails).
