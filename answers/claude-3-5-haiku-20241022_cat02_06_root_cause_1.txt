Let's analyze the event log and provide insights into the ticket resolution process:

1. Total Resolution Times:

Case ID | Receive Time         | Close Time            | Total Resolution Time
--------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------
101     | 2024-03-01 08:00    | 2024-03-01 10:15     | 2h 15m
102     | 2024-03-01 08:05    | 2024-03-02 09:15     | 25h 10m
103     | 2024-03-01 08:10    | 2024-03-01 09:30     | 1h 20m
104     | 2024-03-01 08:20    | 2024-03-02 08:30     | 24h 10m
105     | 2024-03-01 08:25    | 2024-03-03 09:30     | 49h 05m

2. Performance Issues and Root Causes:

Significant Performance Bottlenecks:
- Cases 102, 104, and 105 show dramatically longer resolution times
- Primary factors contributing to delays:

a) Escalations:
- Case 102: Escalated to Level-2 Agent
- Case 105: Escalated to Level-2 Agent with extended investigation time

b) Extended Waiting Periods:
- Case 102: Large gap between initial assignment and escalation (2.5 hours)
- Case 104: Long waiting time before investigation (4.5 hours)
- Case 105: Extremely long gap between escalation and further investigation (over 24 hours)

3. Detailed Analysis and Recommendations:

Specific Observations:
1. Escalation Process Inefficiency:
- When tickets are escalated (Cases 102 and 105), they experience significant delays
- Level-2 agents seem to have prolonged response times
- Recommendation: Implement a more streamlined escalation protocol with:
  * Clear SLAs for escalation response
  * Dedicated escalation team with defined turnaround times
  * Automated escalation tracking and alerts

2. Investigation Bottlenecks:
- Some tickets (Cases 104 and 105) have extended investigation periods
- Possible reasons: Complex issues, resource constraints, or inefficient investigation processes
- Recommendations:
  * Develop standardized investigation guidelines
  * Provide additional training for agents
  * Implement knowledge management systems
  * Consider additional resource allocation during peak times

3. Triage and Assignment Improvements:
- Inconsistent triage times (ranging from 5-40 minutes)
- Recommendations:
  * Standardize triage process
  * Use automated initial classification
  * Implement priority-based assignment
  * Create clear routing rules

4. Performance Metrics and Monitoring:
- Develop comprehensive dashboards tracking:
  * Average resolution times
  * Escalation frequencies
  * Agent performance
  * Bottleneck identification

Quantitative Insights:
- Average Resolution Time (excluding outliers): ~3-4 hours
- Problematic Cases (102, 104, 105) average ~33 hours
- Potential time savings: 80-90% by addressing identified bottlenecks

Implementation Strategy:
1. Short-term: Immediate process standardization
2. Mid-term: Technology and training investments
3. Long-term: Continuous process optimization

Conclusion:
The analysis reveals significant opportunities for improving the customer support ticket resolution process through targeted interventions in escalation management, investigation protocols, and resource allocation.
