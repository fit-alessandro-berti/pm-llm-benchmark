Given the provided event log, we need to construct a process tree that captures the main sequence of activities, the optional repeating loop for requesting missing information and re-validation, and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival. Here's a suitable process tree model:

```plaintext
* (
    + (
        'Receive Application (RA)',
        -> (
            'Validate Form (VF)',
            'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
            * (
                'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
                'Validate Form (VF)'
            )
        ),
        'Approval Decision (AD)',
        'Send Confirmation (SC)',
        'Archive Case (AC)'
    )
)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Outer Loop (`*`)**: The outer loop allows the entire sequence to repeat if necessary.
    - **Sequence (`->`)**: The sequence ensures that activities within the parentheses are executed in order.
        - `'Receive Application (RA)'`: This activity always occurs first.
        - **Sequence (`->`)**: Activities within this sequence must occur in order.
            - `'Validate Form (VF)'`: This activity follows after receiving the application.
            - `'Assess Eligibility (AE)'`: This activity follows after validating the form.
            - **Loop (`*`)**: This inner loop allows for the possibility of repeatedly requesting missing information and re-validating the form.
                - `'Request Missing Info (RMI)'`: If missing information is required, this activity will occur.
                - `'Validate Form (VF)'`: After requesting missing information, the form needs to be validated again.
        - `'Approval Decision (AD)'`: This activity follows after assessing eligibility.
        - `'Send Confirmation (SC)'`: This activity follows after the approval decision.
        - `'Archive Case (AC)'`: This activity concludes the process.

This process tree model captures the main flow of the process, including the optional loop for handling missing information and re-validation, ensuring that the model is both fit and precise while remaining simple.
