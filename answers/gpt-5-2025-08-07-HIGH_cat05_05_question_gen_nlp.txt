1) How should we balance single-sourcing of critical components (e.g., microprocessors) against dual- or multi-sourcing to manage risk, and where is the tipping point between cost and resilience?
2) What mechanisms can detect and respond to supplier lead-time variability in real time, and how might multi-echelon safety stocks or postponement strategies dampen the bullwhip effect?
3) In what ways can design-for-supply-chain (modularity, common platforms, alternate part qualifications) be embedded earlier in R&D to reduce dependency on constrained components without sacrificing performance?
4) How should we dynamically choose between air and ocean freight to optimize cost, service levels, and carbon footprint, and what real-time signals should trigger mode switching?
5) Which supplier collaboration models (e.g., CPFR, vendor-managed inventory, digital twins) create the most value, and how do we protect IP and comply with data-privacy and antitrust constraints?
6) How robust is our traceability and compliance across jurisdictions (RoHS, REACH, WEEE, conflict minerals, battery rules), and where are the biggest visibility gaps beyond tier-1 suppliers?
7) How do currency fluctuations, tariffs, and trade policy shifts affect total landed cost and pricing, and what hedging or network reconfiguration options best mitigate volatility?
8) Which quality metrics (first-pass yield, DPPM, field failure rates) most strongly predict warranty costs and customer satisfaction, and how can we shorten the feedback loop from field data to design and process changes?
9) To what extent can predictive analytics and ML improve SKU- and region-level forecasting, and how do we manage bias, seasonality, launch effects, and model drift?
10) What is the optimal inventory placement across suppliers, assembly, DCs, and last mile to meet service targets with minimal working capital, and how should buffers shift during disruptions?
11) How should supplier contracts (SLAs, incentives, penalties, capacity reservations, consignment) be structured to align responsiveness, quality, sustainability, and cost objectives?
12) What cybersecurity and data-integrity risks arise from integrating ERP, EDI, TMS/WMS, and customs systems globally, and how do we ensure resilience against ransomware or document fraud?
13) How should recall and crisis-response protocols (serialization, traceability, notifications, reverse logistics) be designed and tested to minimize safety and brand risk across regions and channels?
14) What are the most impactful opportunities to reduce scope 3 emissions (materials, logistics, packaging), and how do we quantify trade-offs among cost, speed, and carbon (e.g., SAF premiums, slow steaming)?
15) Where are the principal bottlenecks in assembly (line balancing, changeover times, test throughput), and what is the ROI of automation, predictive maintenance, and lean initiatives?
16) How can just-in-time replenishment be reconciled with resilience, and when do strategic buffers, dual sourcing, or nearshoring provide a better risk-adjusted outcome?
17) How does SKU proliferation and regional customization influence complexity, obsolescence, and inventory fragmentation, and can postponement or late-stage configuration mitigate these effects?
18) How do we verify ethical labor practices and environmental compliance across all tiers and logistics partners, and what escalation and remediation pathways exist for non-compliance?
19) What circularity strategies (repairability, refurbishment, parts harvesting, take-back programs) are most viable by region, and how do they influence product design and profitability?
20) How should S&OP/IBP be structured (cadence, roles, scenario planning) to align R&D, manufacturing, finance, and sales under uncertainty, and which cross-functional KPIs best guide decisions?
