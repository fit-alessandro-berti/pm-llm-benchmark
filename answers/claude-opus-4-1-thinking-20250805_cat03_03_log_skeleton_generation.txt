Looking at this order fulfillment process, I'll construct a Log Skeleton that captures the key constraints and relationships between activities.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'D'),  # Every received order must be dispatched
        ('PI', 'PO'),  # Every picked order must be packed
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # Every shipping label generated leads to dispatch
    },
    
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Check availability before reserving
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserve before picking
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Pick before quality check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Quality check before packing
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # Pack before generating shipping label
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # Generate shipping label before dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),  # Dispatch before invoicing
        ('IC', 'RP'),  # Invoice before recording payment
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receive order before checking availability
    },
    
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # After receiving order, check availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # After checking availability, reserve items
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # After reserving, pick items
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # After picking, do quality check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # After quality check, pack order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # After packing, generate shipping label
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # After generating label, dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),  # After dispatch, invoice customer
    },
    
    'never_together': set(),  # All activities can co-exist in a normal order fulfillment
    
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},     # Receive order exactly once
        'CA': {1},     # Check availability exactly once
        'RI': {1},     # Reserve items exactly once
        'PI': {1},     # Pick items exactly once
        'QC': {1},     # Quality check exactly once
        'PO': {1},     # Pack order exactly once
        'GSL': {1},    # Generate shipping label exactly once
        'D': {1},      # Dispatch exactly once
        'IC': {1},     # Invoice customer exactly once
        'RP': {0, 1},  # Record payment 0 or 1 time (payment might be pending)
    },
    
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),   # Check availability immediately after receiving order
        ('GSL', 'D'),   # Dispatch immediately after generating shipping label
    }
}
```

This Log Skeleton captures the essential constraints of the order fulfillment process:
- The process follows a largely sequential flow from receiving an order to potentially recording payment
- Most activities occur exactly once per order, except payment recording which is optional
- Key dependencies are maintained (e.g., can't pack before picking, can't dispatch before labeling)
- Direct succession is enforced where activities must occur immediately after one another
