<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to create a Python dictionary that represents the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process. The Log Skeleton has specific constraints, and I need to make sure each of them is correctly applied.

First, let me recall what each constraint means. The Log Skeleton has six keys: equivalence, always_before, always_after, never_together, activ_freq, and directly_follows. The values for the first five are sets of activity pairs, and the sixth is a dictionary of activity occurrence counts.

The scenario involves a sequence of activities from receiving the order to dispatching and invoicing. Let me list out the activities again:

RO (Receive Order)
CA (Check Availability)
RI (Reserve Items)
PI (Pick Items)
QC (Quality Check)
PO (Pack Order)
GSL (Generate Shipping Label)
D (Dispatch)
IC (Invoice Customer)
RP (Record Payment)

Now, I need to apply the constraints. Let's go step by step.

First, the equivalence constraint: If the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one. So, for any pair in the equivalence set, if one is present, the other must be as well. Wait, actually, the equivalence constraint says that if the first activity occurs, then the second one must have the same occurrences. So, for example, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must also be present with the same count. But I need to check if there are any pairs that need to be equivalent. Maybe the equivalence is between activities that are in the same order. Hmm, maybe the equivalence is between activities that are in the same sequence. Wait, the equivalence constraint is a bit unclear. Let me think again.

The equivalence constraint says: If the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one. So, for example, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must have the same occurrence count. But I need to see which activities are in the same occurrence. Wait, maybe the equivalence is between activities that are in the same sequence. Like, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must be present with the same count. But maybe the equivalence is between pairs that are in the same order. For example, if RO is followed by CA, then their occurrence counts must be the same. But I'm not sure. Maybe the equivalence is that if an activity is present, then the other must be present. Wait, no, the equivalence is about the same occurrences. So, if the first activity occurs, then the second must have the same number of occurrences. So, for example, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must be present with the same count. But how do I determine which pairs are equivalent?

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same occurrence, they must be considered equivalent. Wait, the problem says: "If the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one." So, for example, if activity A occurs, then activity B must occur with the same number of times. So, if A is in the equivalence set, then B must be in the same occurrence count. But how to determine which pairs are equivalent?

Alternatively, perhaps the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same sequence, their occurrence counts must be the same. For example, if RO is followed by CA, then their counts must be the same. But this is unclear. Maybe the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same sequence, their occurrence counts must be the same. But how do I know which pairs are equivalent?

This is a bit confusing. Let me look at the example given in the prompt. The activ_freq is a dictionary mapping each activity to a set of allowed occurrence counts. So, for example, if an activity is in the equivalence set, then the other must have the same count. But maybe the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same sequence, they must be considered equivalent. Wait, perhaps the equivalence is that if an activity is in the equivalence set, then the other must be present. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that if an activity is in the equivalence set, then the other must be present. Wait, no. The equivalence constraint is about the same occurrences. So, if the first activity occurs, then the second must have the same occurrences. So, for example, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must be present with the same count. But how to determine which activities are in the equivalence set?

Wait, maybe the equivalence is that if an activity is present, then the other must be present. But that's not the case. The equivalence is about the same occurrence counts. So, for example, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must be present with the same count. But I need to figure out which pairs are in the equivalence set.

Alternatively, perhaps the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same occurrence, they must be in the same set. But I'm not sure. This is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that the occurrence counts of the activities must be the same. So, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA's occurrence count must be the same as RO's. But how to know which pairs are equivalent?

This is tricky. Let me try to think of the constraints in terms of the order of activities. The process is:

RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP

But there might be some steps that are not in order. For example, maybe after PO, there's a step that's not in the list. Wait, the given activities are the ones listed. So the order is RO, CA, RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, RP.

But maybe there are some steps that are not in the same sequence. For example, maybe after RI, there's a step that's not in the list. But according to the scenario, the activities are as given.

Now, the equivalence constraint: if the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one. So, for example, if RO occurs, then CA must occur with the same number of times. But how to determine which pairs are equivalent? Maybe the equivalence is that the occurrence counts of the activities must be the same for any pair that is in the same sequence. For example, if RO is followed by CA, then their occurrence counts must be the same. But how to know which pairs are in the same sequence?

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same sequence, their occurrence counts must be the same. But without knowing which pairs are in the same sequence, this is hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the equivalence is that if an activity is in the equivalence set, then the other must be in the same occurrence count. But how to determine which pairs are in the equivalence set?

This is confusing. Let me try to think of the constraints for each key.

The 'equivalence' key's value is a set of pairs (tuples) of activities that satisfy the equivalence constraint. So, if the first activity occurs, then the second must have the same occurrences. So, for example, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must be in the same occurrence count. But how to know which pairs are in the equivalence set?

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same occurrence, then they must be in the same set. But I'm not sure.

Perhaps the key is that the equivalence is between consecutive activities. For example, if RO is followed by CA, then their occurrence counts must be the same. But how to know which pairs are in the equivalence set?

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that if an activity is in the equivalence set, then the other must be in the same occurrence. But this is not helpful without knowing which pairs are in the equivalence set.

This is really challenging. Let me try to proceed step by step.

First, the activ_freq is a dictionary mapping each activity to a set of allowed occurrence counts. For example, if the activity is RO, then the allowed counts are {0,1}, etc. But the problem says that the activ_freq is a dictionary mapping each activity to a set of allowed occurrence counts. So, I need to define that.

But the scenario is a sequence of activities. Let's assume that each activity can occur 0 or 1 times in a case. Wait, the example given in the prompt is {'A': {0,1}, 'B': {1,2}}. So, the allowed counts are 0,1, etc. So, for each activity, the allowed counts are a set. So, for the given scenario, the activ_freq would be something like:

RO: {0,1}
CA: {0,1}
RI: {0,1}
PI: {0,1}
QC: {0,1}
PO: {0,1}
GSL: {0,1}
D: {0,1}
IC: {0,1}
RP: {0,1}

But maybe the allowed counts are different. For example, maybe some activities can't be in the same case. Wait, the 'never_together' constraint says that two activities cannot co-exist in the same case. So, if two activities are in the same case, they can't be in the same occurrence. So, the activ_freq may have constraints on which activities can be in the same case. But the user hasn't specified any constraints on the occurrence counts, except that the activ_freq is a dictionary. So, perhaps the activ_freq is simply that each activity can occur 0 or 1 times. But maybe there are some constraints. For example, maybe the 'never_together' constraint affects the activ_freq. Wait, the 'never_together' is a separate constraint. So, the activ_freq is just about the allowed counts, and the 'never_together' is about which activities can't be in the same case.

But the user hasn't given any specific constraints on the occurrence counts except for the activ_freq. So, I can assume that each activity can occur 0 or 1 times. So, the activ_freq would be a dictionary where each activity has {0,1} as the allowed counts.

But maybe the activ_freq is different. For example, if some activities can't be in the same case, but the activ_freq is just about the allowed counts. Wait, the problem says that the activ_freq is a dictionary mapping each activity to a set of allowed occurrence counts. So, the user is to construct the dictionary, and the activ_freq may have constraints. But the scenario doesn't specify any constraints on the occurrence counts, so I can assume that each activity can be present 0 or 1 times.

So, for activ_freq, I'll set each activity to {0,1}.

Now, the other constraints: equivalence, always_before, always_after, never_together, directly_follows.

The 'equivalence' key's value is a set of pairs (tuples) of activities that satisfy the equivalence constraint. So, if an activity occurs, then the other must have the same occurrence count. So, for example, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must be present with the same count. But how to determine which pairs are in the equivalence set?

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same sequence, their occurrence counts must be the same. For example, if RO is followed by CA, then their occurrence counts must be the same. So, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must be in the same occurrence count. But how to know which pairs are in the equivalence set?

This is really unclear. Maybe the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same case, their occurrence counts must be the same. But the problem says that the equivalence is about the first activity occurring, then the second must have the same occurrences. So, if the first activity occurs, then the second must have the same count. So, for example, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must be in the same count. But how to know which pairs are in the equivalence set?

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same case, then their occurrence counts must be the same. But that's not clear from the prompt.

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that the occurrence counts of the activities must be the same for any pair that is in the same sequence. For example, if RO is followed by CA, then their counts must be the same. So, in the activ_freq, RO and CA would have the same counts. But how to know which pairs are in the equivalence set?

This is really confusing. Let me think of the process as a sequence of activities. The process is RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP.

If the equivalence is that if an activity occurs, then the next one must have the same count, then maybe the equivalence is between consecutive pairs. For example, RO and CA must have the same count. So, the equivalence set would include (RO, CA), (CA, RI), (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D), (D, IC), (IC, RP). But that would make the equivalence set have all consecutive pairs. But that seems too much.

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same sequence, their occurrence counts must be the same. But without knowing which pairs are in the same sequence, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same case, then their occurrence counts must be the same. But the scenario is a single case, so maybe the equivalence is that if an activity is in the case, then the next one must have the same count. So, for example, RO and CA must have the same count. So, the equivalence set would be { (RO, CA), (CA, RI), (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D), (D, IC), (IC, RP) }.

But that would mean that each consecutive pair must have the same count. But that's a lot of pairs. But the problem says that the equivalence is a set of pairs. So, if the equivalence is that all consecutive pairs must have the same count, then the equivalence set would include all those pairs.

But how to know if that's the case. The prompt says that the equivalence constraint is that if the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one. So, if RO occurs, then CA must occur with the same count. So, if RO is in the equivalence set, then CA must be in the same count. But if CA is in the equivalence set, then RI must be in the same count. But this would require that all consecutive pairs have the same count. So, the equivalence set would include all consecutive pairs.

But this would imply that the occurrence counts of all consecutive activities are the same. So, for example, RO and CA can be 0 or 1, but they must be the same. Similarly, CA and RI must be the same, etc.

But this would make the activ_freq for each activity have the same count as the previous one. For example, if RO is 0, then CA is 0, RI is 0, etc. But that's not possible unless all activities have the same count. But the example given in the prompt has activities with different counts. So, maybe the activ_freq is not constrained by the equivalence, but the equivalence is that the counts are the same for consecutive pairs.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe the user expects that the equivalence is between consecutive activities, so that if one occurs, the next has the same count. So, the equivalence set would include all consecutive pairs. But that would make the activ_freq have the same counts for each pair.

But how to translate that into the dictionary.

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence is that the occurrence counts of the activities must be the same for any two activities that are in the same sequence. For example, if RO and CA are in the same sequence, then their counts must be the same. But since they are consecutive, this is the same as the previous idea.

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe the user expects that the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same case, their occurrence counts must be the same. But in the scenario, there's only one case, so maybe the equivalence is that the occurrence counts of all activities are the same. But that's not possible unless all activities have the same count. But the example in the prompt allows for different counts. So, this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same occurrence, they must be in the same count. But that's not clear.

This is really challenging. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that the equivalence is that if two activities are in the same sequence, their occurrence counts must be the same. So, for example, if RO and CA are in the same sequence, then their counts must be the same. But since they are consecutive, this would mean that their counts are the same. So, the equivalence set would include all consecutive pairs.

So, the equivalence set would be:

RO, CA

CA, RI

RI, PI

PI, QC

QC, PO

PO, GSL

GSL, D

D, IC

IC, RP

So, each consecutive pair is in the equivalence set. Then, the activ_freq for each activity would have the same count as the previous one. But since the activ_freq is a dictionary, each activity's allowed counts would be {0,1}.

But this seems like a lot of constraints. However, the problem says that the equivalence constraint is that if the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second. So, if RO occurs, then CA must have the same count. Which would mean that the counts for RO and CA are the same. But if the activ_freq is {0,1} for each activity, then that's allowed.

But this would make the activ_freq for each activity have the same count as the previous one. For example, if RO is 0, then CA is 0, etc. But the activ_freq is just about allowed counts. So, the activ_freq would be {RO: {0,1}, CA: {0,1}, ... }.

So, the equivalence set would include all consecutive pairs.

Now, the 'always_before' constraint: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously. So, the first activity must come before the second. Which is already the case in the process. So, the always_before constraint is satisfied by the order of the activities.

The 'always_after' constraint: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. So, if the first activity is in the 'always_after' set, then the second activity must come after it. But this is already the case. So, the always_after constraint is also satisfied by the order of the activities.

The 'never_together' constraint: The two activities cannot co-exist inside the same case. So, in the scenario, there's only one case, so this constraint would mean that no two activities can be in the same case. But since there's only one case, this is automatically satisfied. So, the never_together constraint is not applicable here, or maybe it's not needed. But the user wants the dictionary to include it. So, perhaps the never_together is a set of pairs that cannot be in the same case. But if there's only one case, then the never_together constraint is not applicable, so the set would be empty or something.

But the user wants the dictionary to include the never_together key with a set of pairs. So, maybe the never_together is empty because there are no conflicting pairs. But the scenario has all activities in the same case, so the never_together constraint would require that no two activities are in the same case. But since they are all in the same case, there are no pairs that can co-exist. So, the never_together set would be empty.

But the problem says that the never_together is a set of pairs that cannot co-exist. So, if there are no such pairs, the set is empty.

So, the never_together set is empty.

Now, the 'directly_follows' constraint: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity shall occur immediately after. So, the first activity must be directly followed by the second. Which is the case in the process. So, the directly_follows set would include all consecutive pairs. For example, (RO, CA), (CA, RI), etc.

So, putting it all together:

equivalence: all consecutive pairs.

always_before: since the activities are in order, this is satisfied. But the always_before is a set of pairs (tuples) of activities that satisfy the constraint. So, if the first activity occurs, then the second must have been executed before. Which is already the case. So, the always_before would be the same as the directly_follows? Or is it a different set?

Wait, the always_before is a set of pairs where if the first activity occurs, the second must have been executed before. So, the always_before is the set of pairs (A, B) such that A must come before B. Which is the same as the order of the activities. So, in the scenario, the order is RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP. So, the always_before set would be the pairs (RO, CA), (CA, RI), (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D), (D, IC), (IC, RP). Because if any of these pairs are in the always_before set, then the first activity must come before the second. Which is already the case.

But the always_before is a set of pairs (tuples) of activities that satisfy the constraint. So, if the first activity occurs, the second must have been executed before. So, the always_before is the set of pairs that are in the order. So, the always_before is the same as the directly_follows? Or is it different?

Wait, the always_before is about the first activity occurring, then the second must have been executed before. So, the always_before is the set of pairs (A, B) where A must come before B. Which is the same as the directly_follows constraint, but the directly_follows is about the second activity occurring immediately after the first. So, the directly_follows is about the immediate next activity, while the always_before is about the previous activity.

So, the always_before is the set of pairs where A must come before B. Which in the scenario is the same as the direct_follows, because the activities are in order. So, the always_before would be the same as the direct_follows.

But the problem says that the directly_follows is a set of pairs (tuples) of activities that satisfy the directly_follows constraint. So, if the first activity occurs, the second must occur immediately after. So, the directly_follows is the set of pairs where A is followed by B immediately. Which is the same as the always_before constraint, but the always_before is about the first activity being before the second.

Wait, the always_before constraint says that if the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously. Which is the same as the directly_follows constraint. Because if the first activity occurs, then the second must be executed before. So, the directly_follows is a subset of the always_before constraints. So, the always_before is a set of pairs that must be in order, and the directly_follows is a subset of that.

But the problem says that the directly_follows is a set of pairs where if the first activity occurs, then the second activity shall occur immediately after. So, the directly_follows is the set of pairs that are consecutive in the sequence. So, the directly_follows would be the same as the always_before, but the always_before is a set of pairs that must be in order.

But I think that the directly_follows is a separate constraint. So, the directly_follows is the set of pairs that must be consecutive, and the always_before is the set of pairs that must be in order.

But the problem says that the always_before is a set of pairs (tuples) of activities that satisfy the constraint. So, if the first activity occurs, the second must have been executed before. Which is the same as the directly_follows constraint. So, the always_before is the same as the directly_follows.

But this is getting too tangled. Let me try to write the final answer based on the assumptions I made.

So, the equivalence set would include all consecutive pairs. The always_before and directly_follows would be the same as the consecutive pairs. The never_together is empty. The activ_freq is each activity allowed to occur 0 or 1 times.

So, the final dictionary would be:

{
    'equivalence': {('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('D', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')},
    'always_before': {('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('D', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')},
    'always_after': {('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('D', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')},
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {0, 1},
        'CA': {0, 1},
        'RI': {0, 1},
        'PI': {0, 1},
        'QC': {0, 1},
        'PO': {0, 1},
        'GSL': {0, 1},
        'D': {0, 1},
        'IC': {0, 1},
        'RP': {0, 1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('D', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')}
}

But wait, the always_after and directly_follows are the same? The problem says that the always_after constraint is that if the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. So, the directly_follows is about the second activity occurring immediately after, while the always_after is about the second activity being executed in one of the following events. So, the always_after is a bit different. For example, if the first activity is RO, then the second activity must be executed in one of the following events. So, if the first activity is RO, then the second activity must be executed after it. But the directly_follows is that the second activity must be executed immediately after. So, the always_after is a more general constraint, allowing the second activity to be executed after the first, but not necessarily immediately. But the directly_follows is about the immediate next activity.

But the problem says that the always_after constraint is that if the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. So, the second activity can be after the first, but not necessarily immediately. So, the always_after is a set of pairs where the first activity must come before the second, but the second can be in any event after the first. However, the directly_follows is that the second activity must be immediately after the first.

So, the directly_follows is a subset of the always_after. So, the always_after includes all pairs where the first activity occurs before the second, but the directly_follows is the subset where the second occurs immediately after.

But in the scenario, the activities are in order, so the directly_follows would be the same as the always_after. So, the directly_follows is the same as the always_after. But the problem says that the always_after is a set of pairs where the second activity is executed in one of the following events. So, if the first activity is RO, then the second activity must be executed after it, which is already the case. So, the always_after constraint is satisfied by the order of the activities. So, the always_after and directly_follows are the same.

But the problem says that the always_after is a set of pairs where if the first activity occurs, then the second is executed in one of the following events. So, if the first activity is RO, then the second activity (CA) must be executed after RO, which is already the case. So, the always_after is satisfied by the order of the activities. So, the always_after is the same as the directly_follows.

But this is getting too complex, and I need to make a decision.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct approach is to set the equivalence to all consecutive pairs, the always_before and directly_follows to the same set, and the never_together as empty. The activ_freq is each activity allowed to occur 0 or 1 times.

So, the final dictionary would look like the one above.
</think>

To construct the **Log Skeleton** for the given order fulfillment process, we must apply the declarative constraints as described in the prompt. The Log Skeleton is a Python dictionary with six keys: `equivalence`, `always_before`, `always_after`, `never_together`, `activ_freq`, and `directly_follows`.

---

### **Key Constraints and Interpretation**

We are given a sequence of activities (from receiving the order to shipping the package), and we need to apply the following constraints:

1. **Equivalence** – If the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second.
2. **Always Before** – If the first activity occurs, the second must have been executed before.
3. **Always After** – If the first activity occurs, the second activity must be executed in one of the following events.
4. **Never Together** – Two activities cannot co-exist in the same case.
5. **Activity Occurrences** – Each activity can occur 0 or 1 times in a case.
6. **Directly Follows** – If the first activity occurs, the second must occur immediately after.

---

### **Activity Order and Constraints**

The activities in the order of the process are:

- **RO** (Receive Order)  
- **CA** (Check Availability)  
- **RI** (Reserve Items)  
- **PI** (Pick Items)  
- **QC** (Quality Check)  
- **PO** (Pack Order)  
- **GSL** (Generate Shipping Label)  
- **D** (Dispatch)  
- **IC** (Invoice Customer)  
- **RP** (Record Payment)

We apply the constraints:

---

### **1. `equivalence` – Pairs of activities that must occur with the same count**

If the first activity occurs, the second must have the same occurrence count. This applies to all consecutive pairs in the sequence.

- `RO`  `CA`
- `CA`  `RI`
- `RI`  `PI`
- `PI`  `QC`
- `QC`  `PO`
- `PO`  `GSL`
- `GSL`  `D`
- `D`  `IC`
- `IC`  `RP`

So, the `equivalence` set is:

```python
{'RO': 'CA', 'CA': 'RI', 'RI': 'PI', 'PI': 'QC', 'QC': 'PO', 'PO': 'GSL', 'GSL': 'D', 'D': 'IC', 'IC': 'RP'}
```

---

### **2. `always_before` – Activities must occur in the correct order**

This is the same as the `equivalence` constraint, because if `RO` occurs, `CA` must occur before it. The same applies to all consecutive pairs.

So, the `always_before` set is:

```python
{'RO': 'CA', 'CA': 'RI', 'RI': 'PI', 'PI': 'QC', 'QC': 'PO', 'PO': 'GSL', 'GSL': 'D', 'D': 'IC', 'IC': 'RP'}
```

---

### **3. `always_after` – Activities must occur after the previous one**

This is a general constraint that allows the second activity to occur after the first, but not necessarily immediately. Since the activities are in strict order, this is satisfied.

So, the `always_after` set is:

```python
{'RO': 'CA', 'CA': 'RI', 'RI': 'PI', 'PI': 'QC', 'QC': 'PO', 'PO': 'GSL', 'GSL': 'D', 'D': 'IC', 'IC': 'RP'}
```

---

### **4. `never_together` – Activities cannot co-exist in the same case**

In this scenario, all activities are in a single case. Therefore, no two activities can co-exist. The `never_together` set is empty:

```python
set()
```

---

### **5. `activ_freq` – Allowed occurrence counts for each activity**

Each activity can occur 0 or 1 times in a case. So, the `activ_freq` is:

```python
{
    'RO': {0, 1},
    'CA': {0, 1},
    'RI': {0, 1},
    'PI': {0, 1},
    'QC': {0, 1},
    'PO': {0, 1},
    'GSL': {0, 1},
    'D': {0, 1},
    'IC': {0, 1},
    'RP': {0, 1}
}
```

---

### **6. `directly_follows` – Activities must occur immediately after**

This is the same as the `always_before` constraint, since the activities are in order and each follows immediately after the previous.
