### Analysis of the Event Log

#### 1. Identifying Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

To identify cases with significantly longer resolution times, we need to calculate the total time taken from the "Receive Ticket" event to the "Close Ticket" event for each case.

- **Case 101:**
  - Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:00
  - Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 10:15
  - Total Time: 2 hours 15 minutes

- **Case 102:**
  - Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05
  - Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:15
  - Total Time: 25 hours 10 minutes

- **Case 103:**
  - Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:10
  - Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:30
  - Total Time: 1 hour 20 minutes

- **Case 104:**
  - Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:20
  - Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:30
  - Total Time: 24 hours 10 minutes

- **Case 105:**
  - Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:25
  - Close Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:30
  - Total Time: 45 hours 5 minutes

From the above calculations, **Cases 102, 104, and 105** have significantly longer resolution times compared to Cases 101 and 103.

#### 2. Determining Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

**Case 102:**
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent:** The ticket was escalated to a Level-2 agent, which often indicates a more complex issue.
- **Long Waiting Times:** There is a 2.5-hour gap between the assignment to a Level-1 agent and the escalation to a Level-2 agent. Additionally, there is a 2.5-hour gap between the escalation and the investigation by the Level-2 agent.

**Case 104:**
- **Long Waiting Times:** There is a 3.5-hour gap between the assignment to a Level-1 agent and the investigation of the issue. The resolution and closure of the ticket also span across two days.

**Case 105:**
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent:** The ticket was escalated to a Level-2 agent.
- **Long Waiting Times:** There is a 24-hour gap between the escalation to a Level-2 agent and the subsequent investigation. The resolution and closure of the ticket span across three days.

#### 3. Explanation and Recommendations

**Root Causes:**
- **Escalations:** Cases that require escalation to a Level-2 agent tend to take longer due to the additional steps and potentially more complex issues.
- **Long Waiting Times:** Delays between activities, particularly between assignment and investigation, significantly contribute to the overall resolution time.
- **Cross-Day Activities:** Tickets that span multiple days often indicate inefficiencies or delays in the process.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Streamline Escalation Process:** Ensure that escalations to Level-2 agents are handled promptly. This might involve better communication protocols or prioritization of escalated tickets.
2. **Reduce Waiting Times:** Implement measures to reduce the time between activities. This could involve setting service level agreements (SLAs) for each step in the process and monitoring adherence to these SLAs.
3. **Improve Communication:** Ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the ticket status and any delays. Regular updates and follow-ups can help in identifying and addressing delays early.
4. **Optimize Workload Distribution:** Ensure that Level-1 agents are not overloaded, which can lead to delays in assignment and investigation. Consider load balancing or additional training for Level-1 agents.
5. **Automate Routine Tasks:** Use automation tools to handle routine tasks, freeing up agents to focus on more complex issues.
6. **Monitor and Analyze Performance:** Regularly review the event log to identify patterns and bottlenecks. Use data-driven insights to continuously improve the process.

By addressing these factors, the customer support ticket resolution process can be made more efficient, reducing the overall resolution time and improving customer satisfaction.
