```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

This query first identifies all `case_id`s with 6 or fewer events using a subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`. It then filters the full `event_log` table to return only the events belonging to those qualifying cases, preserving all original columns and rows for them.
