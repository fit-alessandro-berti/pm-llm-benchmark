Based on the constraints provided in your DECLARE declarative process model, here are some potential anomalies or issues:

1. **Redundancy in Constraints**:
   - **Existence vs. Exactly 1**: You have both "Existence" and "Exactly 1" for the same activities (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Request Payment, Payment Handled, Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE). "Exactly 1" inherently implies existence, making the separate "Existence" constraints redundant.
   - **Co-Existence and Responded Existence**: For each pair of activities in "Co-Existence", there are also "Responded Existence" constraints. For instance, if 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled' co-exist, it's redundant to specify that if one happens, the other must also happen (which is what "Responded Existence" does). 

2. **Conflicting Constraints**:
   - **Exactly 1 and Co-Existence**: If 'Request Payment' must occur exactly once and it must co-exist with 'Payment Handled', then 'Payment Handled' must also occur exactly once (to satisfy the co-existence for both directions). This might limit the process flexibility unnecessarily.

3. **Initialization and Absence**:
   - **Initialization**: The model starts with 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', which is appropriate. However, with the "Absence" constraints, it seems several activities are explicitly forbidden. This might overly restrict the process flow, especially if any of these activities might be necessary under certain conditions not captured by the current model.

4. **Succession and Chain Succession Overlap**:
   - **Succession vs. Chain Succession**: For instance, ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled') is under both "Succession" and "Chain Succession". "Chain Succession" is a stricter version where one directly follows the other, making the general "Succession" constraint somewhat redundant unless there's a specific scenario where the order might not be directly consecutive.

5. **Alternate Constraints**:
   - **Alternate Response/Precedence/Succession**: These constraints imply that the activities must alternate without repetition. This could potentially restrict the process flow in scenarios where an activity might need to occur more than once in succession due to errors or iterations, which might not be realistic in some business processes.

6. **Response and Chain Response Overlap**:
   - Similar to the succession constraints, having both "Response" and "Chain Response" for the same activity pairs like ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled') might be redundant. If "Chain Response" is satisfied, "Response" is inherently satisfied.

7. **Potential for Deadlock**:
   - **Co-Existence and Alternate Succession**: If activities must strictly alternate due to "Alternate Succession" and must co-exist due to "Co-Existence", there might be scenarios where the process could deadlock if the constraints are too tight or if there's no clear path defined for how these activities should alternate.

8. **Lack of Flexibility in Process Flow**:
   - The model might be too rigid due to the numerous and sometimes overlapping constraints. This could lead to scenarios where the process model does not allow for exceptions or variations in the process which might be necessary in real-world scenarios.

To refine the model, you might consider:
- Removing redundant constraints.
- Reviewing the necessity of each constraint for actual business logic.
- Ensuring that constraints do not overly restrict the process to the point of making it impractical or inflexible.
- Simplifying the model where possible to enhance clarity and manageability. 

Consider discussing these points with process stakeholders to ensure that the model accurately reflects the intended process while maintaining flexibility and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
