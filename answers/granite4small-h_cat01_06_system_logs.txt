**Explanation:**
The logic used to transform the Windows system log into an event log involved grouping activities by context and user interaction flow. Each distinct document edit session or email communication sequence was considered a separate case, with sequential actions within each identified as individual events.

- **Case ID**: Grouped primarily by document or application use; for example, all interactions involving `Document1.docx` form one case (1), while those associated with the PDF and Excel documents formed another (2).
  
- **Activity Name**: Derived from lower-level activities to represent higher-level actions. For instance, "FOCUS" on an open document was consolidated into a single activity called "Edit Document," assuming that focusing indicates intent to edit or read. Similarly, viewing emails involved "Open Email" and "View Email."

- **Timestamp**: The original timestamp of the event is retained for accuracy in process analysis.

Additional attributes such as `Keys` from typing events were ignored since they are less relevant at this high-level overview but could be included if needed for more granular analysis. This transformation provides a clear, organized account of user activities that should facilitate effective process mining and subsequent analyses by identifying patterns or inefficiencies within the documented workflow steps.
