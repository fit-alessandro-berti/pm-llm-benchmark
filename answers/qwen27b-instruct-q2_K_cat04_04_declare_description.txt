The data provided describes a declarative process model containing various constraints about interactions and sequences of different activities in an organizational context related to handling declarations and payments. The processes are described through pairs of activities where the relationships follow certain rules outlined below:

Existence Constraint:
1. `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, `Request Payment`, `Payment Handled`, `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` must occur.

This constraint states that each organization should have these four activities happening sequentially in this order.

Alternate Response Constraint :
2.`('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL.APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment')`, etc.).

Each pair within the tuple must follow another in alternating order but not at consecutive positions.

Exactly One Constraint:
3.`'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'` must occur exactly once.

This constraint states that each activity can happen only once regardless of their sequence.

Precedence Constraint :
4.`('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment')`, etc.).

Each pair must follow another in chronological order.

Chain Precedence Constraint :
5.`('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')`

These activities must be followed one immediately after the other regardless of their position.

Alternate Precedence Constraints :
6.`('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVD by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment')`, etc.).

Each pair within the tuple must follow another in alternating order but not necessarily consecutively.

Response Constraint :
7.`('Declaration FINAL_APPROVD by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled')`, etc.).

These activities must follow another regardless of order.

Chain Response Constraint :
8.`('Declaration FINAL_APPROVD by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')`

These activities must be followed one immediately after the other regardless of their position.

Co-Existence Constraint :
9.`'Request Payment', 'Declaration FINAL APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'` must occur concurrently.

These activities can happen simultaneously irrespective of their order.

The absence rules state that certain activities cannot occur depending upon preceding conditions:

10.`'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`, 'Denied PAYMENT', 'RECEIVED REFUND'`, etc.).

These activities are not allowed to happen under specific conditions following the previous activities listed beforehand
