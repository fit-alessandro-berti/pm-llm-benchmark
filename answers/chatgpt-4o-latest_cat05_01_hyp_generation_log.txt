Based on the provided **event log** and **reference schemas**, the model can identify potential **anomalies, investigate hypotheses**, and suggest **relevant SQL queries** accordingly. Below is a comprehensive breakdown:

---

##  1. **Anomaly Detection in Order Event Sequence**

###  **Observation 1: Out-of-Order Activities**
- For `case_id = 1002`, **Confirm Shipment** and **Ship Goods** occur **before** **Credit Check** and **Stock Validation**.
- For `case_id = 1003`, **Ship Goods** precedes **Confirm Shipment**, which is illogical.
- For `case_id = 1004`, **Receive Payment** happens **before** invoice/shipment—inverted business logic.

####  Hypothesis:
- These might be due to:
  - Lack of process enforcement in system workflow.
  - Manual overrides by users.
  - System automation triggers misaligned with business logic.

####  SQL Investigation:
```sql
-- Identify cases where "Ship Goods" occurs before "Perform Credit Check"
SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2
  ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND oel2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
  AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp
ORDER BY oel1.case_id;

-- Identify cases where "Receive Payment" happens before "Issue Invoice"
SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2
  ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
  AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;
```

---

##  2. **Skipped or Missing Activities**

###  **Observation 2: Missing Activities**
- `case_id=1004` appears to **miss** “Perform Credit Check” and “Validate Stock” altogether.
- No “Register Order” for `case_id=1002` before shipment confirmation—not enough validation?

####  Hypothesis:
- Some orders might bypass key verification steps under **priority order rules**, **test scenarios**, or **internal process flaws**.
- Employees might be following unofficial "fast lanes".

####  SQL Investigation:
```sql
-- Find case_ids missing critical activities
SELECT DISTINCT o.case_id
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_event_log e1 ON o.case_id = e1.case_id AND e1.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
LEFT JOIN order_event_log e2 ON o.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
WHERE e1.event_id IS NULL OR e2.event_id IS NULL;

-- Count how many steps each case has to identify those with outliers
SELECT case_id, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS unique_activities
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
ORDER BY unique_activities;
```

---

##  3. **Premature or Duplicate Payments**

###  **Observation 3: Payment Before Shipment**
- `case_id = 1004`: Payment received before proper invoicing or shipment confirmation.

####  Hypothesis:
- Could indicate:
  - Audit loopholes
  - Manual payment reconciliation issues
  - Front-loaded payments

####  SQL Investigation:
```sql
-- Identify orders where payments precede invoice/shipping
SELECT oel.case_id, 
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) AS payment_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) AS invoice_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_time
FROM order_event_log oel
WHERE activity IN ('Receive Payment', 'Issue Invoice', 'Ship Goods')
GROUP BY oel.case_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) <
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END);
```

---

##  4. **Unauthorized or Improper Resource Behavior**

###  **Observation 4: Inconsistent Resource Involvement**
- `FinanceTeam_02` (a **Cashier**) is issuing invoices in some cases, which may be the job of a **Billing Officer**.
- `WarehouseClerk_3` is shipping goods before confirming the shipment.

####  Hypothesis:
- Role conflict or inadequate role-based access controls.
- Staff operating outside defined responsibilities.

####  SQL Investigation:
```sql
-- Find roles performing unauthorized activities
SELECT e.resource, r.role, e.activity, COUNT(*)
FROM order_event_log e
JOIN resources r ON e.resource = r.resource_id
GROUP BY e.resource, r.role, e.activity
ORDER BY e.activity, COUNT(*) DESC;

-- List cases where warehouse staff shipped goods without confirmation preceding
SELECT o1.case_id
FROM order_event_log o1
JOIN order_event_log o2 
  ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id 
WHERE o1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND o2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND o1.timestamp < o2.timestamp
  AND o1.resource IN (
    SELECT resource_id FROM resources WHERE role LIKE '%Warehouse%'
  );
```

---

##  5. **Fast-Tracked Logistics Activities**

###  **Observation 5: Logistics Steps Happening Too Quickly**
- `case_id=1002` has Registration, Shipment Confirmation, and Goods Shipped within 20 minutes.

####  Hypothesis:
- Internal SLAs may be violated, or timestamps spoofed/generated decoupled from real process.

####  SQL Investigation:
```sql
-- Find cases where Register Order to Ship Goods is < 30 minutes
SELECT case_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN timestamp END) AS register_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ship_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM(
          MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) -
          MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN timestamp END)
       ))/60 AS minutes_taken
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity IN ('Register Order', 'Ship Goods')
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM(
          MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) -
          MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN timestamp END)
       ))/60 < 30;
```

##  Summary Table of Issues

| Anomaly Type                     | Potential Cause                          | Proposed SQL |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Out-of-sequence process steps    | Weak system rules / manual overrides     |  |
| Skipped steps                    | Process shortcut, test order             |  |
| Early payments                   | Misaligned billing/payments              |  |
| Inappropriate resource action    | Role misuse, lack of access control      |  |
| Implausibly fast turnarounds     | Data logging errors or fast-track policy |  |

---

##  Final Notes:
- Consider introducing process adherence checks and constraints.
- Add validation workflows at the application level to block premature or mis-sequenced actions.
- Audit resource access logic to match activity types with allowed roles.
