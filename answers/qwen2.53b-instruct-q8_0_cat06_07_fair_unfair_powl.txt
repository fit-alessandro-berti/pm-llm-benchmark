Certainly! Below are the two POWL models representing different approaches to handling the cultural fit and community affiliation check in GlobalTeq Solutions' hiring process.

### Model with Potential Unfairness (Unfairness Present)

In this model, there is an XOR branch that provides a slight advantage to applicants affiliated with certain local groups or residents. This can introduce potential bias into the decision-making process.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition

# Define basic activities and transitions
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops and xor branches
Loop1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck])
Loop2 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CommunityAffiliationCheck, FinalDecision])

XorBranch = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, Loop2])

# Construct the main workflow
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        ReceiveApplication,
        DataCompletenessCheck,
        SkillAssessment,
        XorBranch,
        ManagerialReview,
        FinalDecision
    ],
    order={
        ReceiveApplication: None,
        DataCompletenessCheck: ReceiveApplication,
        SkillAssessment: DataCompletenessCheck,
        XorBranch: DataCompletenessCheck,
        CommunityAffiliationCheck: Loop1,
        FinalDecision: Loop2,
        ManagerialReview: FinalDecision,
    }
)

# Print the model
print(pm4py.dumps_model(root))
```

### Model Without Unfairness (Unfairness Absent)

In this model, all applicants undergo the same standard cultural fit evaluation process without any special community-based branch. This ensures a more fair and transparent hiring process.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition

# Define basic activities and transitions
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops and xor branches
Loop1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck])

XorBranch = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[
        CommunityAffiliationCheck,
        FinalDecision
    ]
)

CulturalFitLoop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[
        CulturalFitCheck,
        XorBranch
    ]
)

# Construct the main workflow
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        ReceiveApplication,
        DataCompletenessCheck,
        SkillAssessment,
        Loop1,
        ManagerialReview,
        FinalDecision,
    ],
    order={
        ReceiveApplication: None,
        DataCompletenessCheck: ReceiveApplication,
        SkillAssessment: DataCompletenessCheck,
        Loop1: DataCompletenessCheck,
        CulturalFitLoop: DataCompletenessCheck,
        CommunityAffiliationCheck: Loop1,
        XorBranch: FinalDecision,
        ManagerialReview: FinalDecision
    }
)

# Print the model
print(pm4py.dumps_model(root))
```

### Explanation of Models

- **Model with Potential Unfairness:**  
  This model includes an XOR branch where applicants can either undergo a standard cultural fit evaluation or take a path that provides a slight advantage to those affiliated with certain local groups. This creates a bias by making some candidates more favorable than others based on community affiliations.

- **Model Without Unfairness:**  
  This model ensures all candidates go through the same standardized cultural fit evaluation process. There is no special branch for community-based advantages, ensuring that only their qualifications and skills are considered in the hiring decision process.

Both models adhere to the guidelines provided in the original description and demonstrate how to handle potential bias in a fair way within the workflow structure.
