- Adds new customers to database if needed
- Sends order details and drafts invoice

Production Lane:

Procurement Lane:
- Contains a "Material Compensation Subprocess"
- Handles ordering materials
- Includes material checking
- Has return material option
- Manages order cancellation

Warehouse Lane:

The diagram uses standard BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) symbols including:
- Start/end events (circles)
- Tasks (rectangles)
- Gateways (diamonds)
- Message events
- Connecting arrows and dashed lines for messages

The process flows from left to right and shows various decision points and parallel activities, with clear communication paths between different departments indicated by dashed message flows.
