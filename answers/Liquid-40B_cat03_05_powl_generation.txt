Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple example of a Purchase-to-Pay process modeled using POWL in pm4py:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
purchase = Transition(label="Purchase")
approve = Transition(label="Approve")
pay = Transition(label="Pay")
receive = Transition(label="Receive")

# Define the choice between approve and receive
choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[approve, receive])

# Define the loop between purchase and pay
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[purchase, pay])

# Define the partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, choice])
root.order.add_edge(loop, choice)
```

In this example, the Purchase-to-Pay process is modeled as a loop between the "Purchase" and "Pay" activities, with a choice between the "Approve" and "Receive" activities. The loop is followed by the choice, and the partial order is defined such that the loop must be completed before the choice can be executed.
