### Real-World Motivations and Consequences:

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring that each step is documented and occurs in the correct sequence helps maintain compliance with financial regulations. Non-compliance can result in legal penalties and fines.

- **Fraud Prevention:** Steps like the **Preliminary_Credit_Check** and **Quality_Assurance_Review** help in identifying and mitigating fraudulent activities. Skipping these steps could lead to financial losses and reputational damage.

- **Risk Management:** Proper sequencing and verification at each stage help manage risk. For instance, authorizing contract terms without a quality assurance review could lead to mismanaged risks.

- **Operational Best Practices:** Following a structured process ensures efficiency and consistency. Omitting mandatory steps or performing them out of order can lead to operational inefficiencies and errors.

- **Customer Satisfaction:** A well-structured process ensures that customers are informed and satisfied with the service. Notifying customers prematurely or incorrectly can lead to dissatisfaction and potential loss of business.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance:

- **Financial Losses:** Skipping the **Preliminary_Credit_Check** could lead to loaning money to high-risk applicants, resulting in defaults and financial losses.

- **Legal Penalties:** Non-compliance with regulatory requirements, such as failing to perform a **Quality_Assurance_Review**, could result in legal actions and penalties.

- **Operational Inefficiencies:** Performing activities out of order, such as authorizing contract terms before gathering additional documents, could lead to operational errors and delays.

- **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Notifying customers before finalizing the loan terms or transferring funds could lead to confusion and dissatisfaction.

In summary, the DECLARE model ensures a logical, compliant, and efficient loan approval process, protecting both the financial institution and the customer from potential risks and inefficiencies.
