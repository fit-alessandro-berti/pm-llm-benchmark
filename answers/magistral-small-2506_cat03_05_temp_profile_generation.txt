Here’s a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process. The values are estimated based on realistic assumptions for high-tech electronics manufacturing, accounting for variability in lead times, inspection thoroughness, and logistical delays.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected pairs (likely to have tighter time distributions)
    ('SS', 'OP'): (43200, 3600),       # ~12 hours (half-day) to place order after supplier selection, low variability
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),     # ~7 days (1 week) for components to arrive, high variability due to shipping delays
    ('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 1800),        # ~2 hours for inspection after receipt, low variability
    ('QI', 'CA'): (3600, 900),         # ~1 hour to start assembly after inspection, low variability
    ('CA', 'PT'): (10800, 2700),       # ~3 hours for testing after assembly, moderate variability
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 900),         # ~1 hour for packaging after testing, low variability
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800),        # ~1 hour for storage, moderate variability (warehouse congestion)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 43200),     # ~3 days for distribution, high variability (shipment scheduling)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 21600),      # ~1 day to activate after-sales support, moderate variability

    # Pairs with indirect connections (longer time spans, higher variability)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (691200, 86400),     # ~8 days (1 week + lead time variability)
    ('SS', 'CA'): (1382400, 172800),   # ~16 days (2 weeks + variability)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (1209600, 216000),   # ~14 days (2 weeks + variability)
    ('RC', 'PK'): (1209600, 172800),   # ~14 days (2 weeks + variability)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (2016000, 432000),   # ~23 days (3 weeks + variability)
    ('CA', 'AS'): (2160000, 518400),   # ~25 days (3.5 weeks + variability)

    # Edge cases (longest spans, highest variability)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (2592000, 518400),   # ~30 days (1 month) from start to distribution
    ('OP', 'AS'): (2678400, 604800),   # ~31 days (1 month) with post-sales support activation
}
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Directly Connected Pairs**: These have tighter time distributions (e.g., `('OP', 'RC')` reflects supplier lead times).
2. **Indirect Pairs**: These accumulate variability across multiple steps (e.g., `('SS', 'CA')` spans procurement, inspection, and assembly).
3. **High-Variability Pairs**: Longer spans (e.g., `('SS', 'DT')`) reflect logistical and operational delays in global supply chains.
4. **Units**: All times are in seconds for consistency (e.g., `86400` = 1 day, `3600` = 1 hour).

This profile balances realism with variability, mirroring the complexity of high-tech supply chains. Adjustments can be made based on domain-specific data.
