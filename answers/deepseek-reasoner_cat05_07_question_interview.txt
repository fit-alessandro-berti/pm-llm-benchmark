Here’s a structured list of open-ended questions to deepen understanding of the property onboarding process, organized by focus area:

### **Process Gaps & Documentation**  
1. How do you handle situations where a landlord cannot provide required documents (e.g., missing inspection reports) due to external constraints? Are there alternative pathways to proceed?  
2. What happens if a property fails inspection *after* documentation is initially approved? Does this trigger a re-verification of earlier steps?  

### **Decision-Making & Role Clarity**  
3. When assigning property managers, how are conflicts resolved between competing priorities (e.g., workload vs. geographic expertise)? Who makes the final decision?  
4. Are there standardized checklists or templates used during the landlord-manager introductory meeting to ensure consistency in aligning expectations?  
5. Who is responsible for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants during the screening phase (e.g., disagreements over lease terms)?  

### **Timing, Sequencing & Dependencies**  
6. How are photographer and inspector schedules coordinated? What happens if one is delayed—does this pause the entire process?  
7. Are there specific timeframes or SLAs for critical steps (e.g., inspection completion after documentation approval)? What bottlenecks are most common?  

### **Exceptions & Custom Scenarios**  
8. How are "unique" landlord requirements (e.g., custom lease clauses) documented and communicated across teams to avoid misalignment later?  
9. For properties requiring special insurance or non-standard compliance checks, how does the process differ from the standard workflow? Who oversees these exceptions?  

### **Marketing & Financial Strategy**  
10. How does the digital marketing team validate "current market trends" when setting prices? What happens if a landlord insists on a price outside the recommended range?  
11. Are there scenarios where marketing begins *before* inspection approval, or is this strictly sequential?  

### **Tenant Screening & Risk Management**  
12. What explicit criteria or thresholds are used to prioritize tenants (e.g., credit score minimums, income ratios)? How are subjective factors (e.g., references) weighted?  
13. If a tenant disputes a rejection (e.g., claims unfair screening), how is this escalated and resolved?  

### **Quality Assurance & Compliance**  
14. If a compliance officer identifies an issue post-activation (e.g., a lease clause violating fair housing laws), what steps are taken to rectify it?  
15. How are discrepancies between the IT system’s data and physical property details (e.g., incorrect amenities listed) identified and corrected?  

### **Communication & Tooling**  
16. How do you ensure communication continuity between stakeholders (e.g., landlords, regional offices) when handoffs occur (e.g., coordinator to property manager)?  
17. Are there pain points in the current CRM/project management tools that hinder tracking or collaboration?  

### **Process Evolution & Feedback**  
18. How are lessons learned from past onboarding exceptions (e.g., delayed repairs, disputed leases) incorporated into future process improvements?  
19. What metrics or KPIs are tracked to evaluate the efficiency and success of the onboarding process?  

These questions aim to uncover implicit workflows, decision-making hierarchies, risk mitigation strategies, and opportunities for refinement in the described process.
