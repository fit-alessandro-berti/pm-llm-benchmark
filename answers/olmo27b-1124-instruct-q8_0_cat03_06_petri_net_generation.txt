To construct an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process using the provided Python framework (`pm4py`), we need to model the transitions and places according to the described steps. The places will represent stages, the transitions will represent activities moving from one stage to another, and arcs will denote the flow direction. Let's define the components:

1. **Places:**
   - `CLAIM`: Represents the claim being processed.
   - `CR`: Claim Registration
   - `DV`: Document Verification
   - `FC`: Fraud Check
   - `CA`: Claim Assessment
   - `AP`: Approval
   - `P`: Payment
   - `N`: Notification
   - `CL`: Closure
   
2. **Transitions:**
   - `register_claim` (CR  CLAIM): Represents the registration of a new claim.
   - `verify_documents` (DV  CLAIM): Represents document verification and moving to the next stage.
   - `fraud_check` (FC  CLAIM): Represents fraud detection checks and potential looping back to FC if needed.
   - `assess_claim` (CA  CLAIM): Represents claim assessment leading to approval or further investigation.
   - `approve_claim` (AP  CLAIM): Represents approval of the claim above a certain threshold.
   - `pay_claim` (P  CL): Represents the payment of the claim and finalizing it.
   - `notify_customer` (N  CL): Represents sending the notification about the claim resolution.
   - `close_claim` (CL  CL): Represents closing and archiving the claim.

3. **Arcs:**
   - From CR to CLAIM, DV to CLAIM, etc.
   - Loop arcs from FC to itself if re-examination is needed.
   - From CA to AP if approval is needed.

4. **Initial Marking (im):**
   - `CLAIM`: 1 token (representing a new claim).
   - All other places: 0 tokens.

5. **Final Marking (fm):**
   - `CL`: 1 token (claim closed and archived).
   - All other places: 0 tokens.

Below is the Python code to construct this Petri net using the given library:

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Place, Transition, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Define the places
CLAIM = Place(name="CLAIM")
CR = Place(name="CR")
DV = Place(name="DV")
FC = Place(name="FC")
CA = Place(name="CA")
AP = Place(name="AP")
P = Place(name="P")
N = Place(name="N")
CL = Place(name="CL")

# Define the transitions
register_claim = Transition(name="register_claim", label="register_claim")
verify_documents = Transition(name="verify_documents", label="verify_documents")
fraud_check = Transition(name="fraud_check", label="fraud_check")
assess_claim = Transition(name="assess_claim", label="assess_claim")
approve_claim = Transition(name="approve_claim", label="approve_claim")
pay_claim = Transition(name="pay_claim", label="pay_claim")
notify_customer = Transition(name="notify_customer", label="notify_customer")
close_claim = Transition(name="close_claim", label="close_claim")

# Construct the Petri net
net = PetriNet(name="claim_process")

# Add places to the net
net.places.add(CR)
net.places.add(DV)
net.places.add(FC)
net.places.add(CA)
net.places.add(AP)
net.places.add(P)
net.places.add(N)
net.places.add(CL)

# Add transitions and define arcs
net.transitions.add(register_claim)
net.transitions.add(verify_documents)
net.transitions.add(fraud_check)
net.transitions.add(assess_claim)
net.transitions.add(approve_claim)
net.transitions.add(pay_claim)
net.transitions.add(notify_customer)
net.transitions.add(close_claim)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CR, register_claim, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(DV, verify_documents, net)
# Example loop arc from FC back to itself
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(FC, fraud_check, net)
# Assume approval requires assessment and manager's approval
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CA, approve_claim, net)
# Pay out transition goes directly to closure
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(P, close_claim, net)

# Initial marking (im): Only the CLAIM place has a token
im = Marking()
im[CLAIM] = 1
# Final marking (fm): CL place has a token signifying claim closed
fm = Marking()
fm[CL] = 1

# No tokens in other places initially or finally
for place in [CR, DV, FC, CA, AP, P, N]:
    im[place] = 0
    fm[place] = 0

print("Initial marking:", im)
print("Final marking:", fm)

# Remove the sink (CL) to reflect it is final state
petri_utils.remove_place(net, CL)
del fm[CL]

print("Net constructed and final marking defined.")
```

In this code snippet, we first define the places and transitions necessary to model the insurance claim process. Then we construct the Petri net by adding these components and defining the arcs between them. We set up the initial and final markings according to the problem requirements.

The `remove_place` function call at the end is necessary to remove the "CL" place from the net, as it represents the final state of the process. The final marking dictionary (`fm`) will not contain any tokens for places other than `CLAIM`, which should have 1 token, and `CL`, which should have 1 token.
