### Baseline (typical P2P control flow)
A standard Procure-to-Pay sequence is usually:

**Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  Receive Goods/Service  Invoice Received  2-/3-way match (PO–GR–Invoice)  Release Payment  Close**

(Variations exist, but **payment is normally after approval and after invoice validation/matching**, and **goods receipt normally follows PO issuance**.)

## Case-by-case anomaly analysis

### Case 1001 — **Looks normal**
Sequence follows the expected order: PR created/approved, PO issued, goods received, invoice received, invoice matched, payment released, case closed. No obvious anomaly.

---

### Case 1002 — **Multiple control-breaking order reversals**
**Observed order (key issues):**
- **Issue Purchase Order occurs before Approve Purchase Requisition**
- **Release Payment happens extremely early** (right after invoice receipt), and **before**:
  - PR approval
  - Goods receipt
  - Invoice-to-PO match

**Why this is problematic**
- **Unauthorized spend / bypassed approval:** Issuing a PO before PR approval defeats a core authorization control (risk of maverick buying).
- **Paying before validation:** Releasing payment before matching (and before receipt) increases risk of:
  - Paying for goods/services not received
  - Paying incorrect quantities/prices
  - Fraud (fake invoice paid without controls)
- **Three-way match ineffective:** If matching happens after payment, it can’t prevent improper payment—at best it only detects issues after the money is gone.

---

### Case 1003 — **Payment released before invoice and before receipt**
**Observed order (key issues):**
- **Release Payment occurs before Vendor Invoice Received**
- Payment also occurs before **Receive Goods** and before **Match Invoice to PO**

**Why this is problematic**
- **Conceptually inconsistent in most P2P setups:** Normally you need an invoice (or at least a validated payable) to trigger payment. Paying before invoice suggests:
  - An advance payment incorrectly logged as “Release Payment,” or
  - A severe process/control violation, or
  - Data quality issues (timestamps/events out of order)
- **High financial risk:** Paying before receipt and match creates maximum exposure to:
  - Non-delivery
  - Overpayment
  - Paying the wrong vendor or wrong amount
- **Audit/compliance red flag:** This pattern commonly triggers audit findings unless explicitly governed (e.g., approved prepayment terms with specific controls).

---

### Case 1004 — **Goods received before PO is issued**
**Observed order (key issue):**
- **Receive Goods occurs before Issue Purchase Order**

**Why this is problematic**
- **Retroactive PO risk:** Receiving goods before a PO suggests a “post-factum PO” (PO created after the fact to legitimize the purchase).
- **Weak procurement controls:** The PO is the formal authorization and commercial agreement (price, terms, supplier). Receiving before PO can indicate:
  - Maverick buying
  - Emergency/off-contract procurement without proper approval
  - Incomplete master/contract controls
- **Matching and dispute issues:** If the PO is created after receipt, matching may be forced to “fit” the receipt/invoice rather than validate it objectively.

---

## Summary of anomalies
- **Case 1002:** PO issued before PR approval; payment before approval/receipt/match.  
- **Case 1003:** Payment before invoice/receipt/match (very strong anomaly).  
- **Case 1004:** Goods receipt before PO issuance (likely retroactive PO / control bypass).  

If you want, I can also label each anomaly as either **process violation vs. possible data-quality issue** and suggest specific controls (e.g., system blocks, tolerance checks, three-way match enforcement) that would prevent each pattern.
