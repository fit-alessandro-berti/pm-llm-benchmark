Here's a Python dictionary representing the **Log Skeleton** for the described **order fulfillment process** in a warehouse:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        # Once order is dispatched, invoice must be sent; and vice versa
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'D')
    },
    'always_before': {
        # Activities that must occur before others
        ('CA', 'RI'),      # Check Availability must happen before Reserving Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),      # Reserve Items before Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),      # Pick Items before Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),      # Quality Check before Packing Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),     # Pack Order before Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),      # Generate Shipping Label before Dispatch
        ('RO', 'CA'),      # Receive Order before Check Availability
        ('D', 'IC'),       # Dispatch must happen before Invoicing
        ('IC', 'RP')       # Invoice must happen before Recording Payment
    },
    'always_after': {
        # Activities that must be followed by others
        ('RO', 'CA'),      # Once order is received, next step is Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),      # After Check Availability is Reserving Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),      # After Reserve Items is Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),      # After Pick Items is Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),      # After Quality Check is Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),     # After Pack Order is Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),      # After Generate Shipping Label is Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),      # After Dispatch is Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')      # After Invoice is Record Payment
    },
    'never_together': {
        # These activities should never occur together in the same case
        ('RO', 'D'),      # Receiving an order and Dispatch should not be in same case (unlikely to happen together)
        ('PI', 'RP')      # Pick Items and Record Payment should not co-occur (payment is post-dispatch)
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        # Each activity should occur exactly once per case
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D':  {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        # Direct sequence constraints
        ('RO', 'CA'),     # Receive Order is directly followed by Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),     # Check Availability is directly followed by Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),     # Reserve Items is directly followed by Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),     # Pick Items is directly followed by Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),     # Quality Check is directly followed by Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),    # Pack Order is directly followed by Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),     # Generate Shipping Label is directly followed by Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),      # Dispatch is directly followed by Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')      # Invoice Customer is directly followed by Record Payment
    }
}
```

###  Explanation of Constraints:

- **Equivalence**: `D` and `IC` must always occur together and in the same number of times — the order must be dispatched before invoicing, and vice versa.
- **Always Before/After**: These constraints enforce a strict **sequential order** of steps.
- **Never Together**: Certain activities shouldn't co-occur, e.g., `RO` and `D` shouldn't appear in the same case unless the process is repeated or corrupted.
- **Activity Frequency**: Every activity should occur **exactly once** per case (i.e., per order).
- **Directly Follows**: These define the **immediate next step** after a given activity — enforcing the **exact process flow**.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust the constraints for a more **flexible** or **variant-rich** process!
