Grouping hospital process events into separate cases requires identifying patterns such as shared patient attributes (`patient_age` and `patient_gender`) and logical progressions of activities within those attributes. Based on the provided events, we can infer that the hospital managed **three distinct cases**, as follows:

---

### **Case 1**: Male patient, 45 years old (ER journey)  
This patient's journey mainly involves activities in the ER department.  
**Related events:**  
1. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z** - *Register patient*  
4. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z** - *Initial triage*  
7. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z** - *X-ray imaging*  
12. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z** - *Doctor consultation*  
15. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z** - *Patient discharged*

### **Case 2**: Female patient, 62 years old (ER journey with lab tests and minor infection treatment)  
This patient's journey is also centered in the ER department, with lab work and treatment for a minor infection.  
**Related events:**  
2. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z** - *Register patient*  
5. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z** - *Initial triage*  
8. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z** - *Lab test requested*  
10. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z** - *Lab test completed*  
11. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z** - *Doctor consultation*  
14. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z** - *Prescription created*  
17. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z** - *Patient discharged*

---

### **Case 3**: Male patient, 28 years old (Surgery journey)  
This patient undergoes a scheduled and planned surgery with pre-op preparation, surgery, and recovery.  
**Related events:**  
3. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z** - *Register patient*  
6. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z** - *Doctor consultation*  
9. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z** - *Surgery preparation*  
13. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z** - *Surgery performed*  
16. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z** - *Recovery room*  
18. **Timestamp 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z** - *Patient discharged*

### Summary of Cases:
- **Case 1**: 45-year-old male, ER-related activities (events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15).  
- **Case 2**: 62-year-old female, ER with lab and infection treatment (events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17).  
- **Case 3**: 28-year-old male, Surgery-related journey (events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18).

By grouping events using attributes like `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and the natural order of activities, the cases become clear.
