**Summary of the “normal” P2P flow**

A typical ProcuretoPay (P2P) cycle follows this order (with optional substeps):

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**  
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)** – usually after the requisition is approved.  
4. **Receive Goods / Services** – the PO must exist before receipt.  
5. **Vendor Invoice Received** – the invoice should reference the PO and the receipt.  
6. **Match Invoice to PO (and receipt)** – threeway match (PO, receipt, invoice).  
7. **Release / Authorise Payment** – only after a successful match.  
8. **Close Case / Archive** – final step.

Any deviation from this logical ordering can signal a control weakness, a dataquality problem, or a process exception that may expose the organisation to fraud, duplicate payments, or compliance breaches.

Below are the cases that contain **anomalous sequences** and a brief discussion of why each is problematic.

## 1. Case1002 – Multiple ordering violations

| Step | Activity | Why it is anomalous |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 2 | **Issue Purchase Order** (08:40) | The PO is being issued **before** the requisition has been approved (approval occurs later at 08:00+1day). In a controlled environment the PO should be created **only after** the requisition approval. |
| 34 | **Vendor Invoice Received**  **Release Payment** (07:0007:15) | The invoice is received **before** the goods are received (goods arrive on 04Feb) and **before** the POtoinvoice match (performed on 05Feb). Paying before a match bypasses the threeway matching control and can lead to over or duplicate payments. |
| 5 | **Approve Purchase Requisition** (08:00) | The approval happens **after** the PO issuance and after the invoice/payment steps. This defeats the purpose of the approval gate and suggests the requisition was never truly vetted. |
| 6 | **Receive Goods** (04Feb) | Goods are received **after** the invoice has already been paid. This is a classic “payfirstreceivelater” scenario, raising the risk of paying for undelivered or partially delivered items. |
| 7 | **Match Invoice to PO** (08Feb) | The match is performed **after** payment release, which means the payment could not have been validated by the match. This defeats the core control of the threeway match. |

### Potential problems

* **Control bypass** – The organization’s policy that a requisition must be approved before a PO can be issued is not enforced.  
* **Payment without verification** – Paying before matching removes the safeguard against incorrect, duplicate, or fraudulent invoices.  
* **Risk of paying for undelivered goods** – The invoice was paid before the receipt, exposing the company to loss if the goods never arrive or are defective.  
* **Audit trail inconsistency** – The timestamps suggest the process was forced to run out of order, which would raise red flags in an audit.

## 2. Case1003 – Outoforder receipt and payment

| Step | Activity | Why it is anomalous |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 4 | **Release Payment** (08Feb) | Payment is released **before** the invoice is even received (invoice arrives on 09Feb) and before the goods are received (goods arrive on 10Feb). |
| 56 | **Vendor Invoice Received**  **Receive Goods** | The invoice arrives **after** the payment, and the goods are received **after** the invoice. In a normal flow the receipt should precede the invoice (or at least be contemporaneous) and both should precede payment. |
| 7 | **Match Invoice to PO** (11Feb) | The threeway match occurs **after** payment, again eliminating the verification step. |

### Potential problems

* **Payment without supporting documentation** – Paying before the invoice exists means the payment cannot be linked to a specific claim, increasing fraud risk.  
* **No confirmation of delivery** – Paying before goods are received defeats the “payuponreceipt” control that ensures the vendor actually delivered.  
* **Postpayment reconciliation burden** – Any mismatches discovered later will require retroactive adjustments, creating extra work and possible disputes.

## 3. Case1004 – PO issued after receipt

| Step | Activity | Why it is anomalous |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 3 | **Receive Goods** (06Feb09:00) | Goods are logged as received **before** the Purchase Order is issued (PO issued at 09:15). The PO is the contractual reference that authorises the receipt; receiving without a PO bypasses the authorization step. |
| 4 | **Issue Purchase Order** (06Feb09:15) | The PO is created **after** the goods have already been recorded as received. |

### Potential problems

* **Lack of purchase authority** – Receiving goods without a prior PO means the organization may be taking delivery of items that were never formally requested or budgeted.  
* **Difficulty proving entitlement** – If the vendor later disputes the delivery, there is no preexisting PO to prove that the organization agreed to purchase the items.  
* **Potential for “ghost” deliveries** – This pattern can be exploited to create fictitious receipts that later become the basis for fraudulent invoices.

## 4. Case1001 – No obvious ordering problems, but a timing observation

| Step | Activity | Observation |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 56 | **Vendor Invoice Received** (02Feb11:30)  **Match Invoice to PO** (05Feb09:00) | The match occurs **three days after** the invoice receipt. While not a strict ordering violation, a long lag may indicate delayed verification, which can increase the chance of missed errors or duplicate invoices. |

*This is **not** a hard anomaly, but it is worth noting as a possible inefficiency or controlgap that could be investigated further.*

## 5. Summary of all detected anomalies

| Case | Anomaly type | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **1002** | **Requisition approval after PO**, **Invoice & payment before receipt**, **Payment before matching** | Multiple control bypasses; payment made without proper verification. |
| **1003** | **Payment before invoice/receipt**, **Matching after payment** | Payment issued without any supporting documentation; high fraud risk. |
| **1004** | **Receipt before PO** | Goods accepted without a preexisting purchase authority; potential for unauthorized purchases. |
| **1001** | **Long delay between invoice receipt and match** (minor) | May indicate process inefficiency or delayed controls. |

---

## Why these anomalies are problematic (businessimpact perspective)

| Issue | Business impact |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Skipping or reordering approval steps** | Undermines governance; unauthorized spending can slip through, leading to budget overruns and audit findings. |
| **Paying before invoice/receipt verification** | Opens the door to *payfornothing* fraud, duplicate payments, and overpayments. Recovery can be difficult once funds are transferred. |
| **Receiving goods before a PO exists** | Makes it hard to prove that the purchase was legitimate; can result in “ghost” inventory, inflated stock, or unbudgeted expenses. |
| **Matching after payment** | The threeway match is intended to be a *gate* before cash outflow. Performing it after the fact removes its protective purpose. |
| **Extended delays between steps** | Increases the window for errors to go unnoticed, may cause cashflow timing issues, and can strain vendor relationships if payments are delayed or disputed later. |

## Recommendations for remediation

1. **Enforce strict sequencing in the ERP/workflow system** – Configure the system so that:
   * A PO cannot be created unless the requisition is approved.  
   * The “Release Payment” button is disabled until the threeway match is completed and the receipt is recorded.  
   * Goods receipt cannot be posted without a valid PO reference.

2. **Add automated validation rules** – For example:
   * **InvoicetoPOtoReceipt** rule that checks timestamps and blocks payment if any preceding step is missing or out of order.  
   * **Approvalgate** that logs an exception if a PO is attempted before requisition approval.

3. **Implement exception handling and alerts** – When an outoforder event occurs, automatically flag the case for manual review and send a notification to the procurement compliance team.

4. **Conduct periodic audit of process logs** – Use processmining tools to regularly scan for the patterns identified above and measure the frequency of violations.

5. **Provide training and clear SOPs** – Ensure that all users understand the required order of operations and the rationale behind each control point.

By addressing the identified anomalies and strengthening the controls that enforce the canonical P2P flow, the organization can reduce the risk of fraud, improve financial accuracy, and maintain compliance with internal policies and external regulations.
