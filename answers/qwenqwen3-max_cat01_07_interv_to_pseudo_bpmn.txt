**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

### **Process Name:**  
Invoice Approval and Payment Scheduling

### **Participants/Roles:**  
- **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk** (Mary)  
- **Purchasing Officer** (Dan)  
- **Department Manager** (Carlos)  
- **AP Supervisor** (Rita)  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Karen)  
- **Supplier** (external entity)

### **Start Event:**

---

### **Main Flow**

1. **Task: Validate PO Reference**  
   - **Performed by:** AP Clerk  
   - **Description:** Check if the invoice includes a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.  
   - **Input:** Invoice (email or digital document)  
   - **Output:** Validated invoice (with PO) or request for missing PO  

   **Decision Gateway (Exclusive):**  
   - **Condition:** Does the invoice have a valid PO number?  
     - **Yes ** Proceed to *Log Invoice*  
     - **No **  
       - **Task: Request PO Details from Supplier**  
         - **Performed by:** AP Clerk (may involve Supplier Relationship Manager)  
         - **Output:** Revised invoice with PO (loop back to Validate PO Reference)

2. **Task: Log Invoice in Accounting System**  
   - **Performed by:** AP Clerk  
   - **Input:** Validated invoice with PO  
   - **Output:** Logged invoice record in system

3. **Task: Request Goods/Services Receipt Confirmation**  
   - **Performed by:** AP Clerk  
   - **Description:** Forward invoice to Purchasing Officer to verify that goods/services were received as per PO.

4. **Task: Verify Invoice Against PO and Receipt**  
   - **Performed by:** Purchasing Officer  
   - **Description:** Compare invoice line items (quantities, prices, delivery charges) with PO and receipt confirmation.  
   - **Input:** Logged invoice, PO, receipt confirmation  
   - **Output:** Confirmation email or discrepancy notice

   **Decision Gateway (Exclusive):**  
   - **Condition:** Do invoice details match PO and receipt?  
     - **Yes ** Send confirmation to AP Clerk; proceed to *Match Invoice to PO*  
     - **No **  
       - **Task: Resolve Discrepancy**  
         - **Performed by:** AP Clerk (with support from Purchasing Officer and/or Supplier Relationship Manager)  
         - **Actions:**  
           - Contact supplier for corrected invoice  
           - Verify contract terms (via Supplier Relationship Manager)  
           - Clarify missing or incorrect data  
         - **Sub-Decision Gateway:**  
           - **Condition:** Can discrepancy be resolved?  
             - **Yes ** Return to *Match Invoice to PO*  
             - **No ** **Escalate to AP Supervisor**

5. **Task: Escalate Unresolved Discrepancy**  
   - **Performed by:** AP Supervisor  
   - **Description:** Handle exceptions (e.g., missing PO for informal services, persistent mismatches).  
   - **Actions:**  
     - Coordinate with department heads to create retrospective PO  
     - Decide whether to reject or accept invoice  
   - **Output:** Resolved invoice (re-enter main flow at *Verify Invoice Against PO and Receipt*) or rejection

6. **Task: Match Invoice to PO in System**  
   - **Performed by:** AP Clerk  
   - **Description:** System-based 3-way match (invoice, PO, receipt).  
   - **Output:** Matched invoice record

7. **Task: Request Manager Approval**  
   - **Trigger:** Automatic system notification after successful match  
   - **Performed by:** System (initiates approval request)  
   - **Recipient:** Department Manager

8. **Task: Review and Approve Invoice**  
   - **Performed by:** Department Manager  
   - **Input:** Invoice, PO, receipt confirmation, match result  
   - **Decision Gateway (Exclusive):**  
     - **Condition:** Is invoice acceptable (aligned with budget, no anomalies)?  
       - **Yes ** Approve  
       - **No **  
         - **Task: Reject or Request Investigation**  
           - **Performed by:** Department Manager  
           - **Action:** Notify AP Clerk to hold and investigate  
           - **Loop:** Return to *Resolve Discrepancy* or *Escalate to AP Supervisor*

9. **Task: Schedule Payment**  
   - **Performed by:** AP Clerk  
   - **Trigger:** Upon manager approval  
   - **Description:** Add invoice to next payment cycle  
   - **Output:** Scheduled payment

---

### **End Event:**  
- **Payment Scheduled** (invoice processed for disbursement)

---

### **Artifacts / Data Objects (mentioned):**  
- **Invoice** (email or digital document)  
- **Purchase Order (PO)**  
- **Receipt Confirmation** (from internal system or manual confirmation)  
- **Contract Terms** (referenced by Supplier Relationship Manager)  
- **Approval Notification** (system-generated email)  
- **Payment Schedule** (output of final step)

---

### **Exceptions & Variations Noted:**  
- **Missing PO:** Common initial rejection reason; resolved via supplier follow-up or retrospective PO creation.  
- **Pricing/Quantity Discrepancies:** May require multi-party coordination (AP, Purchasing, Supplier Relationship Manager).  
- **Informal Service Invoices:** No PO exists; handled as exceptions by AP Supervisor with department heads.  
- **Manager Rejection:** Rare (~once every few months), triggers investigation loop.  
- **Escalation Path:** AP Clerk  AP Supervisor for unresolved issues.

---

### **Uncertainties / Consolidated Interpretations:**  
- All interviewees agree that **PO validation** and **3-way match** are mandatory before manager approval.  
- The **exact handoff mechanism** between Purchasing and AP is email-based but system-logged; modeled as a task with confirmation output.  
- **Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager)** is not a formal process step but a supporting role invoked during discrepancy resolution.  
- **Rita (AP Supervisor)** only intervenes in exception paths; not part of the happy path.
