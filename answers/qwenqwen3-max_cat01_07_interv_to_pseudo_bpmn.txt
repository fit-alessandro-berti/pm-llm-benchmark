**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

### **Process Title:**  
Invoice Approval Workflow (Accounts Payable)

---

### **Start Event:**  
**Invoice Received**  
- Trigger: Invoice arrives via email (typically from supplier).  
- Responsible Role: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
- Input Artifact: Supplier Invoice (electronic or scanned)

---

### **Step 1: Validate Purchase Order (PO) Reference**  
- **Activity:** Check if invoice includes valid PO number.  
- **Responsible Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
- **Decision Gateway (Exclusive):**  
  - **Path A (PO Missing/Invalid):**  
     **Activity:** Return invoice to supplier via email, requesting PO or corrected details.  
     **Role Involved:** Accounts Payable Clerk (may involve Supplier Relationship Manager if escalation needed)  
     **Artifact:** Email correspondence, revised invoice (if received)  
     **Loop Back:** Return to Step 1 upon receipt of corrected invoice.  
  - **Path B (Valid PO Present):**  
     Proceed to Step 2.

---

### **Step 2: Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
- **Activity:** Enter invoice details into accounting system (e.g., ERP).  
- **Responsible Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
- **Output Artifact:** Logged invoice record in system.

---

### **Step 3: Forward to Purchasing for Goods/Services Receipt Confirmation**  
- **Activity:** Send invoice to Purchasing Department for validation of receipt.  
- **Responsible Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
- **Artifact Transferred:** Invoice + PO reference in system/email.

---

### **Step 4: Purchasing Validates Invoice Against PO**  
- **Activity:** Compare invoice line items (quantities, prices, charges) with PO.  
- **Responsible Role:** Purchasing Officer  
- **Decision Gateway (Exclusive):**  
  - **Path A (Discrepancy Found):**  
     **Sub-Activity:** Determine nature of discrepancy.  
      - If resolvable internally  Contact supplier directly or request AP to hold invoice.  
      - If requires clarification  Email AP to hold invoice; may involve Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) to liaise with supplier.  
      - If unresolved  Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
         **Activity (Rita):** Investigate, contact supplier, coordinate with departments, possibly create retrospective PO or reject invoice.  
         **Artifact:** Escalation log, revised PO (if created), supplier communication.  
         **Loop Back:** Once resolved, return to Step 4 for re-validation.  
  - **Path B (No Discrepancy):**  
     **Activity:** Send confirmation email to Accounts Payable.  
     Proceed to Step 5.

---

### **Step 5: Match Invoice to PO in System**  
- **Activity:** AP Clerk matches invoice details to PO in system (post-Purchasing confirmation).  
- **Responsible Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
- **Decision Gateway (Exclusive):**  
  - **Path A (Match Fails):**  
     Escalate to Supervisor (Rita) — same exception path as Step 4.  
     Loop back to Step 4 or 5 after resolution.  
  - **Path B (Match Successful):**  
     Proceed to Step 6.

---

### **Step 6: Trigger Manager Approval Request**  
- **Activity:** System automatically generates and sends approval request to Department Manager (Carlos).  
- **Responsible Role:** System (automated)  Department Manager  
- **Artifact:** Approval notification with invoice, PO, and Purchasing confirmation details.

---

### **Step 7: Manager Reviews and Approves/Rejects**  
- **Activity:** Manager reviews total amount, line items, budget alignment, and notes.  
- **Responsible Role:** Department Manager  
- **Decision Gateway (Exclusive):**  
  - **Path A (Approved):**  
     Proceed to Step 8.  
  - **Path B (Rejected or Requires Investigation):**  
     **Activity:** Notify AP Clerk to hold invoice; may request investigation or supplier clarification.  
     **Role Involved:** Accounts Payable Clerk  Possibly Rita or Karen for resolution.  
     **Loop Back:** Return to Step 4 or 5 after issue resolved and re-confirmed.

---

### **Step 8: Schedule for Payment**  
- **Activity:** Add approved invoice to next payment cycle.  
- **Responsible Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
- **Output Artifact:** Payment schedule entry, remittance advice (future step).

---

### **End Event:**  
**Invoice Paid**  
- Trigger: Payment is processed in next payment run.  
- Artifact: Paid invoice status in system, payment confirmation.

---

### **Exceptions & Variations Noted:**

1. **Missing PO Invoices:**  
   - May be returned to supplier OR escalated to Supervisor for retrospective PO creation (if service was informally contracted).  
   - Supervisor (Rita) handles exceptions and may override normal flow.

2. **Persistent Discrepancies:**  
   - Involves Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) to mediate with supplier based on contract terms.  
   - May result in revised invoices or price corrections.

3. **Manager Rejections:**  
   - Rare (per Carlos: “once every couple of months”), but when triggered, causes rework loop back to validation steps.

4. **Escalation Path:**  
   - AP Clerk  Supervisor (Rita)  (optional) Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  Supplier  Loop back to validation.

---

### **Roles & Systems Involved:**

- **Accounts Payable Clerk** – Primary executor of process steps.  
- **Purchasing Officer** – Validates receipt and PO alignment.  
- **Department Manager** – Final approver.  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor** – Exception handler and escalation point.  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** – External issue resolver (supplier-facing).  
- **Accounting System** – Central system for logging, matching, notifications, and payment scheduling.

---

### **Artifacts/Data Objects:**

- Supplier Invoice (initial input)  
- Purchase Order (reference document)  
- Confirmation Email (from Purchasing)  
- Approval Request/Notification (system-generated)  
- Escalation Log / Investigation Notes  
- Revised Invoice (from supplier, if applicable)  
- Retrospective PO (exception case)  
- Payment Schedule Entry (final output)

---

### **Notes on Ambiguity / Consolidation:**

- All interviewees agree on core sequence: PO check  Log  Purchasing validation  Match  Manager approval  Payment.  
- Escalation to Supervisor (Rita) can occur at multiple points (missing PO, mismatch, unresolved discrepancy). Model consolidates these into a unified exception path looping back to validation.  
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) is invoked only in exceptions; not part of happy path.  
- System automation (approval triggers) is confirmed by both Mary and Carlos.

This textual model can be directly translated into a BPMN 2.0 diagram with pools/lanes for roles, tasks, exclusive gateways, sequence flows, message flows (for inter-role handoffs), and data objects. Exception paths are clearly modeled as alternative flows with loop-backs to maintain process integrity.
