1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

a. Utilizing Event Log Data:

- Performance Metrics:
  - **Workload Distribution**: Count the number and type of tickets handled per agent and tier to identify workload imbalances.
  - **Activity Processing Times**: Calculate durations for activities such as ticket creation, assignment, work start/end, escalation, reassignment, and resolution per agent/tier.
  - **First-Call Resolution Rate (FCR)**: Determine the percentage of tickets resolved at L1 to assess efficiency.
  - **Handling Frequency of Specific Skills/Category**: Track how often agents with certain skills handle particular categories, revealing specialization utilization.
  - **Reassignment and Escalation Frequencies**: Quantify how often tickets are reassigned or escalated, including timestamps to analyze delays.

- Process Mining Techniques:
  - **Resource Interaction Analysis**:
    - Generate **Resource-Centric Process Models** showing how tickets move through agents, tiers, and activities.
    - Identify bottlenecks where certain agents or tiers have high workloads or long delays.
  - **Social Network Analysis of Handovers**:
    - Map handover patterns among agents and tiers using **Directly-Follows** and **Handover Graphs**.
    - Detect excessive reassignments, loops, or missing handover links.
  - **Role/Role Discovery**:
    - Apply **Role Mining** algorithms to uncover actual roles/tasks performed, potentially revealing discrepancies between documented skills and actual activity.
    - Detect skill mismatches or underutilized skills by comparing activity patterns with agent skill profiles.

- Skill Utilization Analysis:
  - Cross-reference ticket categories/required skills with assigned agents' documented skills.
  - Detect cases where highly skilled specialists are handling simpler tickets below their skill level, or where complex tickets are assigned to less skilled agents.
  - Use **skill-based clustering** to identify skill gaps and over-concentration.

b. Comparing Actual Patterns to Intended Logic:

- By overlaying the mined process models with designed rules (e.g., initial assignment protocols), you can see deviations such as:
  - Unauthorized or inconsistent reassignments.
  - Unbalanced workload distribution.
  - Unnecessary escalations.
- Identify whether the current process reflects a **skill-based routing** or is primarily heuristic/manual.
- Recognize patterns where the actual flow differs, e.g., frequent manual reassignments, indicating inefficiencies.

2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

- Bottlenecks:
  - Detect resource hotspots by identifying agents or tiers with queue backlogs, long activity durations, or high reassignments.
  - Time delays caused by lack of availability of agents with specific skills, evident from activity duration spikes.
- Delays from Reassignments/Escalations:
  - Quantify *average time* spent in each re-assignment or escalation step.
  - Calculate *percentage of tickets* requiring multiple reassignments, correlating these with SLA breaches.
- Incorrect Initial Assignments:
  - Analyze cases where tickets are escalated shortly after creation, indicating potential misclassification.
  - Detect tickets reassigned repeatedly due to misalignment with agent skills.
- Underperformance/Overload:
  - Use **resource utilization metrics** to pinpoint overloaded agents/tier levels.
  - Identify underutilized agents, suggest leveraging their skills more effectively.
- SLA Correlation:
  - Analyze whether delays and reassignments are statistically associated with SLA breaches.
  - Determine if skill mismatch or workload imbalance is significantly impacting SLA compliance.

3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

- Current Assignment Rules:
  - Reliance on round-robin or manual assignment could cause mismatches.
  - Lack of real-time workload awareness leads to overburdening certain agents.
- Incomplete or Inaccurate Skill Profiles:
  - Skills may be outdated or insufficiently detailed.
  - Missing granular skill levels can lead to inappropriate allocations.
- Poor Ticket Categorization:
  - Inaccurate or inconsistent categorization hampers proper routing.
- Visibility Issues:
  - Limited real-time data prevents dynamic workload balancing.
  - Notifications or dashboards may be absent, leading to reactive rather than proactive assignment.
- Training Deficits:
  - L1 agents may lack necessary training to resolve certain P2/P3 issues, causing unnecessary escalations.
- Variant & Decision Mining:
  - Comparing smooth vs. problematic cases can reveal decision rules used and their shortcomings.
  - Decision mining can uncover implicit routing policies and their deviations.

4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

a. Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting

- Addresses: Mismatched skill assignment, unnecessary escalations.
- Approach:
  - Use historical resolution success rates and activity times to assign higher weights to more proficient agents.
  - Implement an algorithm that matches tickets’ required skills with agents’ proficiency levels.
- Data Needed:
  - Detailed agent skill profiles, resolution success metrics, past assignment and resolution times.
- Benefits:
  - Faster resolution, fewer escalations, improved SLA adherence.

b. Workload-Aware and Capacity-Driven Assignment

- Addresses: Overloading, underutilization, SLA breaches.
- Approach:
  - Incorporate real-time workload data (queue lengths, agent availability) into assignment decisions.
  - Prioritize balancing workloads dynamically.
- Data Needed:
  - Live activity logs, agent availability statuses, historical activity durations.
- Benefits:
  - Improved agent utilization, reduced burnout, faster ticket handling.

c. Predictive and Context-Aware Routing

- Addresses: Ineffective initial categorization, suboptimal assignment.
- Approach:
  - Leverage **text analytics and machine learning** on ticket descriptions to predict complexity and required skills.
  - Preemptively assign setting based on predicted needs.
- Data Needed:
  - Historical ticket texts, categorization accuracy metrics, outcome data.
- Benefits:
  - Increased first-call resolution rates, decreased reassignments, enhanced SLA compliance.

d. Enhanced Escalation and Reassignment Policies

- Addresses: Unnecessary escalations, delays.
- Approach:
  - Use insights from process mining on cases with successful L1 resolution to revise escalation criteria.
  - Establish thresholds based on historical delays or failed resolutions before escalating.
- Data Needed:
  - Timing and success metrics of past escalations/resolutions.
- Benefits:
  - Shorter resolution cycles, less rework, better resource utilization.

5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

- Simulation:
  - Create **virtual process models** incorporating current process behavior, resource capacities, and assignment rules.
  - Run **What-If Scenarios** to evaluate how proposed strategies impact delay times, workload distribution, and SLA adherence.
  - Use Monte Carlo methods to incorporate variability and uncertainty.
- Post-Implementation Monitoring:
  - Develop **Dashboards** with KPIs such as:
    - Average resolution time per tier.
    - Reassignment rate and causes.
    - SLA breach percentages per category or skill.
    - Agent workload distribution over time.
    - First-call resolution rates.
  - Continuously apply process mining techniques to:
    - Detect new bottlenecks.
    - Measure adherence to new routing policies.
    - Identify emerging skill gaps or resource imbalances.
  - Implement **alerting mechanisms** for SLA deviations linked to resource anomalies.

**Summary:**
Using process mining, TechSolve can visualize actual resource utilization, identify inefficiencies, and understand the dynamics behind ticket handling. Tailoring assignment strategies based on detailed behavioral insights—such as skill proficiency, workload, and historical resolution patterns—can significantly enhance operational efficiency and SLA compliance. Regular simulation and monitoring ensure continuous improvement and adaptation to real-world variations.
