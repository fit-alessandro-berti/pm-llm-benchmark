Below is a clear separation between **hardrule (normative) violations** and **softrule (desiderata) deviations**, followed by plausible interpretations.

---

#  1) Normative (Strict) Compliance Check  

### **Case 1**
**Status:**  *Conforms to all strict rules*  
**Reason:**  
Sequence is correct:  
Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Decision (Approved)  Inform  Finalize Documentation  Close.  
Approved path includes documentation before closure. No forbidden actions.

---

### **Case 2**
**Status:**  *Multiple normative violations*  

**Violations:**
1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**  
   - Violates required ordering (Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment).
2. **Missing “Inform Applicant” step**  
   - Informing must happen after decision.
3. **Finalize Documentation after rejection**  
   - Strictly forbidden when decision is “Rejected.”  
4. **Improper flow for rejected case**  
   - A rejected case should be closed **without** documentation.

---

### **Case 3**
**Status:**  *Conforms to all strict rules*  
**Reason:**  
Ordering is correct and approved path includes documentation before closure. No prohibited steps.

---

#  2) Desiderata (Soft BestPractice) Deviations  

> These are *not* serious violations, but indicate suboptimal performance.

### **Case 1**
- **Credit Check timing:** within 30 minutes   
- **Informing timing:** within 2 hours   
- **Followup call:**  *not recorded* (optional recommendation)

**Desiderata status:** *Minor deviation only if followup call is expected.*

---

### **Case 2**
- **Credit Check timing:** within 1 hour   
- **Inform Applicant:**  *missing entirely* (also a strict violation)  
- **Followup call:**  absent  

**Desiderata status:** *Suboptimal communication + no followup.*

---

### **Case 3**
- **Credit Check timing:**  49+ hours after application (>24h)  
- **Inform Applicant timing:**  ~51 hours after decision (>48h)  
- **Followup call:**  absent  

**Desiderata status:** *Multiple soft timing delays + optional call missing.*

---

#  3) Possible Interpretations / Justifications  

### Case 1  
- Likely **straightthrough processing**; no followup call might be unnecessary given a smooth approval.

### Case 2  
- **Data entry/log ordering error** could explain the credit check appearing late.  
- Finalizing documentation after rejection may reflect **a mistaken decision label**, or a **system error**.  
- Applicant may have been informed but the event was **not logged**.

### Case 3  
- Delayed credit check could be due to **external bureau backlog** or a **weekend/holiday gap**.  
- Informing the applicant late could reflect **contact difficulties**.  
- Followup call might have been skipped because the case was low risk.

| Case | Normative Compliance | Normative Issues | Desiderata Issues |
|------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1    |  Yes               | None             | No followup call (optional) |
| 2    |  No                | Risk before Credit, missing Inform, docs after rejection | No followup, no prompt inform |
| 3    |  Yes               | None             | Late Credit Check, late Inform, no followup |
