**Proposed High-Level Activities and Justification:**

1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Events:**
     - Retrieve raw metal sheet
     - Scan barcode
     - Place metal sheet on table
     - Align metal sheet
     - Preheat metal sheet
   - **Justification:**
     - These events are all focused on getting the raw material ready for the next stages of the manufacturing process. They involve retrieving the material, ensuring it is correctly identified and placed, and prepping it for further processing.
   - **Resource Involvement:**
     - Operators and robotic arms are involved in physically handling the material and ensuring it is correctly aligned.
     - Heating units are used to preheat the material to the required temperature.
   - **Example:**
     - Case A1: Material Preparation (08:00:05 - 08:01:00)
     - Case B2: Material Preparation (08:00:05 - 08:01:03)

2. **Assembly**
   - **Events:**
     - Pick up welding tool
     - Weld corner A
     - Weld corner B
   - **Justification:**
     - These events involve the actual construction or assembly of the product. The operator picks up the necessary tools and performs the welding operations.
   - **Resource Involvement:**
     - Operators are the primary resource, using welding tools to join parts together.
   - **Example:**
     - Case A1: Assembly (08:01:00 - 08:01:10)
     - Case B2: Assembly (08:01:03 - 08:01:12)

3. **Quality Inspection**
   - **Events:**
     - Measure weld integrity
   - **Justification:**
     - This event is a dedicated quality check to ensure the integrity of the welding. It is performed immediately after the assembly to catch any issues early.
   - **Resource Involvement:**
     - Quality sensors are used to measure the integrity of the weld.
   - **Example:**
     - Case A1: Quality Inspection (08:01:20)
     - Case B2: Quality Inspection (08:01:22)

4. **Finishing**
   - **Events:**
     - Apply protective coating
     - Dry coating
   - **Justification:**
     - These events involve applying a protective coating to the product and drying it. This step is crucial for ensuring the product is protected and ready for final inspection.
   - **Resource Involvement:**
     - Coating units and heating units are used to apply and dry the coating.
   - **Example:**
     - Case A1: Finishing (08:01:30 - 08:02:00)
     - Case B2: Finishing (08:01:35 - 08:02:05)

5. **Final Quality Check**
   - **Events:**
     - Visual check
   - **Justification:**
     - This event is the final quality check to ensure the product meets all the visual standards before it is considered complete.
   - **Resource Involvement:**
     - Operators perform the visual check to ensure the product is free of visible defects.
   - **Example:**
     - Case A1: Final Quality Check (08:02:00)
     - Case B2: Final Quality Check (08:02:05)
