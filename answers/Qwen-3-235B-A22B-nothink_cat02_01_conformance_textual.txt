# Analysis of Process Deviations in Event Log

## Overview

I'll analyze each case in the event log to identify deviations from the normative process described. The key constraints from the normative process are:

1. "Check inventory" must occur before any decisions about payment authorization or fulfillment
2. "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items"
3. "Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping
4. "Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation
5. "Close order" should be the final activity in all scenarios

## Case Analysis

### Case 1
**Process Flow:** Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close

**Evaluation:** This case follows the normative process perfectly. It begins with receiving the order and checking inventory, then proceeds through payment authorization, packaging, shipping, and finally closing. The sequence indicates sufficient inventory was available and all steps were executed in the correct order.

### Case 2
**Process Flow:** Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close

**Evaluation:** This case violates the normative process. The violation is that "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment" which is incorrect. According to the description, payment should be authorized after inventory check and before packaging. The process treats payment authorization as if it can happen after packaging, which deviates from the stated rule.

### Case 3
**Process Flow:** Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close

**Evaluation:** This case contains multiple violations:
1. After authorizing payment, the process should proceed to packaging, not cancellation
2. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order", which is explicitly stated to be illogical in the description
The case violates the fundamental principle that when cancellation occurs, the process should branch directly to closing without any fulfillment activities like shipping.

### Case 4
**Process Flow:** Receive  Check  Cancel  Close

**Evaluation:** This case follows the normative process for an insufficient inventory scenario. The order is received, inventory is checked and found insufficient, leading to cancellation, followed by closing. This represents the expected "shorter sequence" for cases where inventory is not sufficient.

### Case 5
**Process Flow:** Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close

**Evaluation:** This case violates the normative process. The violation is that "Ship order" occurs directly after "Authorize payment" without the required "Package items" step in between. According to the description, items must be prepared for shipment (package) after authorization and before shipping.

## Summary of Violations

Cases 2, 3, and 5 contain violations of the normative process:

- Case 2: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment" when payment authorization should precede packaging
- Case 3: "Cancel order" follows "Authorize payment" (which might be acceptable, though not explicitly addressed) but then "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order", which is explicitly stated to be illogical
- Case 5: "Ship order" occurs directly after "Authorize payment" without the required "Package items" step in between
