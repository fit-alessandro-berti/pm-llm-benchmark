# Explanation

I grouped events into two distinct cases based on the logical separation of work sessions:

**Case_1** represents a comprehensive work session that started at 09:00 with creating and editing Document1.docx. This session encompasses multiple related activities including document creation, email handling, PDF review, and Excel spreadsheet updates. The user maintained focus on this single coherent work stream throughout, switching between applications to gather information and update the main document.

**Case_2** represents a separate, focused work session that began at 09:07 when the user returned to Quarterly_Report.docx. This appears to be a distinct work item since it was opened after closing Document1.docx and involved different content (Executive Summary).

For activity naming, I translated low-level actions into higher-level process steps:
- "FOCUS"  "Create Document" (when starting a new document) or "Switch Application" (when changing windows)
- "TYPING"  "Write Content" or "Write Email" depending on context
- "SAVE"  "Save Document" or "Save Spreadsheet"
- "CLICK"  "Read Email," "Reply to Email," or "Send Email" based on the action attribute
- "SCROLL"  "Scroll Email" or "Review Document"
- "HIGHLIGHT"  "Highlight Text"
- "CLOSE"  "Close Document"

This transformation creates a meaningful process narrative showing how the user moved between different work items and applications while maintaining context within each case.
