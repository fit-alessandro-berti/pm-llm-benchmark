Based on the provided data, it appears that the "protected" group is subjected to more rigorous checks and processes before loan approval or denial compared to the "unprotected" group.

Here are some key differences:

1. Frequency of loan denial: The frequency of loan denial is higher in the protected group than in the unprotected group.

2. Process length: The protected group has more process variants that involve multiple steps, such as requesting a co-signer, making multiple visits to assess collateral, etc. These processes also take longer (higher performance times) than the processes in the unprotected group.

3. Skipped examination: There is a process variant in the unprotected group where the examination is skipped and the loan is still approved. This does not occur in the protected group.

4. Application rejection: The protected group has a process variant where the application is rejected without even setting an appointment, which does not occur in the unprotected group.

These differences suggest that the protected group may be subject to more stringent scrutiny or stricter lending criteria, which could potentially indicate unfair treatment. However, without additional context or information about the criteria used to determine protected and unprotected status, it's difficult to draw definitive conclusions.
