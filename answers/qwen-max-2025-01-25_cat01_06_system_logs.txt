### Process Mining Event Log

Below is the transformed event log, structured to be suitable for process mining analysis. Each row corresponds to an event with attributes: **Case ID**, **Activity Name**, and **Timestamp**.

### Explanation of Transformation Logic

#### 1. **Case Identification**
   - A "case" represents a logical unit of work centered around a specific document, email, or file being interacted with.
   - Cases were identified based on the `Window` attribute from the raw log, as it uniquely identifies the object (e.g., `Document1.docx`, `Email - Inbox`, `Report_Draft.pdf`, `Budget_2024.xlsx`) being worked on.
   - Events related to the same `Window` were grouped into the same case.

#### 2. **Activity Naming**
   - Raw actions like `FOCUS`, `TYPING`, `SAVE`, etc., were translated into higher-level activities that describe the user's intent:
     - `FOCUS`: Indicates starting or resuming work on a document. Translated to "Start Editing [Document]" or "Resume Editing [Document]."
     - `TYPING`: Represents content creation or modification. Translated to "Drafting Content," "Add Reference to Budget," or similar descriptive names based on context.
     - `SAVE`: Represents saving progress in a document or file. Translated to "Save [Document]."
     - `SWITCH`: Indicates transitioning between applications or documents. Not explicitly included as an activity but used to infer when a new case begins.
     - `CLICK`, `SCROLL`, `HIGHLIGHT`: Contextualized into meaningful activities like "Review PDF," "Scroll Through Email," or "Highlight Key Findings."
     - `CLOSE`: Represents completing or ending work on a document. Translated to "Close [Document]."

#### 3. **Event Attributes**
   - **Case ID**: Derived from the `Window` attribute, representing the document, email, or file being worked on.
   - **Activity Name**: Standardized descriptions of user actions, inferred from the raw action type and contextual details.
   - **Timestamp**: Retained directly from the raw log to preserve temporal order.

#### 4. **Coherent Narrative**
   - The final event log captures a series of user work sessions across multiple documents and applications. For example:
     - The user starts by editing `Document1.docx`, drafts content, saves it, and later resumes editing after reviewing emails and a PDF.
     - The user reviews and replies to an email, highlighting key findings in a PDF and updating a spreadsheet.
     - Finally, the user drafts an executive summary in `Quarterly_Report.docx` before closing it.
   - This structure allows analysts to understand how the user interacts with different files and applications over time, identifying patterns and bottlenecks in their workflow.

By transforming the raw system log into this format, we create a clear and actionable dataset for process mining tools to analyze user behavior and optimize workflows.
