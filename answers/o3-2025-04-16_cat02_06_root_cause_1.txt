1. Tickets with unusually long total cycle times  
   • Case 10108:00 – 10:15 ( 2 h 15 m )  
   • Case 10208:05 (1Mar) – 09:15 (2Mar)  25 h 10 m   outlier  
   • Case 10308:10 – 09:30 ( 1 h 20 m )  
   • Case 10408:20 (1Mar) – 08:30 (2Mar)  24 h 10 m   outlier  
   • Case 10508:25 (1Mar) – 09:30 (3Mar)  49 h 05 m   extreme outlier  

   Using the two “normal” cases (101, 103) as a benchmark (2 h on average), cases 102, 104 and 105 take 12–25× longer and clearly constitute the performance problem.

2. What is driving the delay?

   a. Escalations to Level2  
      • Case 102: Escalated at 11:30, but Level2 does not start investigation until 14:00 (2 h 30 m wait) and the ticket is only resolved nextday 09:00 (19 h in Level2 queue).  
      • Case 105: Escalated at 10:00, Level2 investigation starts the following day at 14:00 (28 h wait) and resolution follows the next morning (another 19 h).  
      Pattern: every time a ticket is escalated, it sits in the Level2 queue for  19 h before work is resumed.  

   b. Long idle time between “Assign to Level1 Agent” and the first “Investigate Issue”  
      • Case 104 (no escalation): Assigned 09:30, investigation starts 13:00 (3 h 30 m idle).  
      • Even after investigation finishes (13:00), resolution is posted the next morning 08:00 (19 h idle).  
      This shows that, even without escalations, work that starts late in the day tends to be paused overnight.

   c. Lateday handoffs and shift boundaries  
      In every slow case, the activity immediately preceding a long gap happens late morning or early afternoon; the next step is picked up only the next business day, indicating that endofshift cutoffs or limited afterhours coverage are prolonging cycle time.

   d. Triage is generally fast ( 30 m) and does not contribute materially to delays.

3. Why these factors extend the cycle time

   • Limited Level2 capacity / coverage: escalated tickets wait in queue until the next Level2 shift becomes available, adding 1–2 calendar days.  
   • Lack of continuous processing: once an investigation or escalation is completed late in the day, the next step is deferred to the following day, introducing an overnight “calendar penalty” of ~15–20 h even though only a few workhours are really needed.  
   • Queueing before investigation: Tickets assigned early but investigated several hours later accumulate idle time while still counted in “timetoresolution”.

4. Recommendations

   1. Strengthen Level2 availability  
      • Introduce staggered or extended Level2 shifts, or an oncall rotation, so escalations raised after 10:00 can still be picked up the same day.  
      • Implement an SLA for Level2 firstresponse (e.g.,  2 h).  

   2. Accelerate the start of investigation  
      • Autonotify the assigned Level1 agent immediately after assignment and set a target to begin investigation within 30 minutes.  
      • Monitor the “Assign  Investigate” lead time; trigger alerts when it exceeds the threshold.  

   3. Minimize overnight carryover  
      • For investigations started after a certain cutoff time, provide a fasttrack resolution window or temporary ownership handoff so that work does not stall overnight.  

   4. Use datadriven workload balancing  
      • Realtime dashboards highlighting tickets that have been idle for > 1 h or are nearing an SLA breach can help supervisors redistribute work before the end of a shift.  

   5. Continuous process monitoring  
      • Regularly mine the event logs to track average waiting times per activity and per resource pool (Level1 vs Level2). Focus improvement initiatives where queues build up.

Adopting these measures should shrink the Level2 waiting queue, prevent overnight idle periods and bring the slow cases (102, 104, 105) down to the sameday resolution benchmark seen in cases 101 and 103.
