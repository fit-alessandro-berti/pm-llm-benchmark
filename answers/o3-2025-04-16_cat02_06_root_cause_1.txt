1. Cases with unusually long cycle times  

   Fast reference pattern (no problems):  
   • Case 101  2 h 15 m|Case 103  1 h 20 m  

   Slow cases:  
   • Case 102  25 h 10 m  
   • Case 104  24 h 10 m  
   • Case 105  49 h 05 m    ( 20–40 × slower than the fast cases)

2. Main performance-degrading patterns seen in the slow cases  

   A. Escalation to Level-2 (Cases 102, 105)  
      – Extra activity “Escalate to Level-2 Agent” always precedes a large idle period before the Level-2 investigation actually starts.  
        • 102: Escalate 11:30  Level-2 Investigate 14:00 (2 h 30 m wait)  
        • 105: Escalate 10:00 (1 Mar)  Level-2 Investigate 14:00 (2 Mar) (28 h wait)  
      – After Level-2 investigation another long pause precedes resolution (19 h in both cases).  
       Escalations therefore introduce two queues: “waiting for Level-2 to pick up” and “waiting for Level-2 to complete / approve fix”.

   B. Idle time between “Assign to Level-1 Agent” and the first investigation (Case 104)  
      – 09:30  13:00 (3 h 30 m wait).  
      – Indicates Level-1 resource shortage or tickets being picked up late in the shift.

   C. Overnight / out-of-hours delays after an investigation has started (Cases 102, 104, 105)  
      – All three tickets stay open overnight after the first investigation event (19 h in each case).  
      – Suggests that investigations begun late in the working day or complex issues get parked until the next shift.

   D. No evidence that “Receive”-to-“Triage” or “Triage”-to-“Assign” cause delays; those transitions are consistently <30 min.

3. How these factors lengthen the total cycle time & recommendations

   Factor  Effect  Possible action

   a. Escalation queues  
      • Limited Level-2 staff or unclear ownership  lengthy wait before work starts.  
      • Work often spans multiple shifts  overnight carry-over.  
      Recommendations:  
        – Introduce SLA for Level-2 pick-up (e.g., <2 h).  
        – Cross-train additional Level-1 agents or create a “Level-1.5” to handle the most frequent escalation reasons.  
        – Implement auto-routing with load balancing to whichever Level-2 agent is free, rather than a manual hand-off.  
        – Capture the reason for escalation; use it to update a knowledge base so future tickets can be solved at Level-1.

   b. Late start of the first investigation after assignment (Case 104)  
      • Probably a queue of tickets per Level-1 agent.  
      Recommendations:  
        – Monitor “Assign  Investigate” lag; trigger alerts when >30 min.  
        – Introduce workload-aware assignment or a round-robin dispatcher to avoid batching tickets on the same agent.  
        – Stagger break times or provide overlap coverage around midday.

   c. Overnight pauses once investigation has started  
      • Indicates hand-off to the next shift or waiting for external info (customer reply, parts, approvals).  
      Recommendations:  
        – Record an explicit “Waiting for Customer / Parts / Approval” event; distinguish unavoidable waits from pure queuing.  
        – Provide 24 × 7 coverage for high-priority tickets or enable follow-the-sun support so another region can continue the work.  
        – Set “resolution before end-of-shift” goal for tickets whose investigation began early enough.

   d. General process monitoring  
      • Establish dashboards for each critical transition:  
        – Receive  Triage  
        – Triage  Assign  
        – Assign  Investigate  
        – Investigate  Resolve  
      • Highlight outliers in real time, not retrospectively.

If the above measures are applied, the expected outcome is that escalated tickets should approach a same-day (8 h) turnaround and non-escalated tickets should stabilize near the 1–3 h cycle time already observed in Cases 101 and 103.
