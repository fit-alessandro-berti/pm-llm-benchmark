### **High-Level Manufacturing Process Steps**

Based on the provided event log and the instructions, I have identified a set of high-level activities that group the low-level events into meaningful stages of the manufacturing process. Below is the structured representation of these high-level activities, along with justifications for each grouping.

---

### **1. Material Preparation**

#### **Low-Level Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

#### **Justification:**
These events are logically connected as they involve preparing the raw material for further processing. The sequence begins with retrieving the metal sheet, identifying it through barcode scanning, positioning it on the table, aligning it precisely, and then preheating it to a specific temperature. These steps are essential for ensuring the material is ready for the subsequent assembly phase.

#### **High-Level Activity Name:**
**Material Preparation**

### **2. Assembly**

#### **Low-Level Events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

#### **Justification:**
These events are grouped together because they represent the core assembly process, where the metal sheet is welded at specific points. The sequence begins with the operator picking up the welding tool, followed by the actual welding of corners A and B. This grouping reflects the distinct phase of the manufacturing process focused on joining components together.

#### **High-Level Activity Name:**
**Assembly**

### **3. Quality Assurance - Welding Inspection**

#### **Low-Level Events:**
- Measure weld integrity

#### **Justification:**
This event is a standalone quality check focused on assessing the integrity of the welds. It is a critical step in ensuring that the assembly meets the required quality standards. Given its distinct purpose and the need for specialized equipment (Quality Sensor #1), it is grouped separately as a quality assurance step.

#### **High-Level Activity Name:**
**Quality Assurance - Welding Inspection**

### **4. Coating Application**

#### **Low-Level Events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

#### **Justification:**
These events are grouped together as they pertain to the application and curing of a protective coating. The sequence involves applying a polyurethane coating to the welded metal sheet and then drying it at a specific temperature. This grouping reflects the distinct phase of the manufacturing process focused on protecting the product and enhancing its durability.

#### **High-Level Activity Name:**
**Coating Application**

### **5. Quality Assurance - Final Inspection**

#### **Low-Level Events:**
- Visual check

#### **Justification:**
This event is a final quality check that involves a visual inspection of the product. It is a critical step in ensuring that the product meets the required quality standards before it is considered complete. Given its distinct purpose and the need for human oversight (Operator C), it is grouped separately as a final quality assurance step.

#### **High-Level Activity Name:**
**Quality Assurance - Final Inspection**

### **Summary**

By grouping the low-level events into these high-level activities, we achieve a clearer and more structured understanding of the manufacturing workflow. Each high-level activity represents a distinct phase of the process, making it easier to manage, analyze, and optimize the manufacturing operations.

This structured approach not only enhances the readability of the event log but also facilitates better decision-making and process improvement initiatives.
