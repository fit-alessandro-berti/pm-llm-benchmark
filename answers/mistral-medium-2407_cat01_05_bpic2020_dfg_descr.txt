Based on the provided data, it appears that the process involves the submission, approval, and payment of employee declarations. Here's a possible description of the process:

1. An employee submits a declaration, which can be for various reasons such as expense reimbursement, leave request, etc.
2. The declaration can be approved or rejected by different roles, such as pre-approver, administration, budget owner, and supervisor.
3. If the declaration is approved by the pre-approver, it goes to the supervisor for final approval. If the declaration is approved by the administration, it can either go to the budget owner or directly to the supervisor for final approval.
4. If the declaration is rejected by any of the roles, it can be resubmitted by the employee or rejected back to the employee, depending on the reason for rejection.
5. If the declaration is missing information, it can be rejected by the supervisor or missing, in which case the employee needs to submit a new declaration with complete information.
6. Once the declaration is finally approved by the supervisor, a request for payment is made.
7. After the payment is handled, the declaration can be closed or rejected by the employee.

The frequency and performance data suggest that the process has varying efficiency and workload at different stages. For example, the longest performance time is observed when the final approved declaration is handed over to payment, which may indicate delays or bottlenecks in payment processing. On the other hand, the shortest performance time is observed when the employee submits a declaration that is saved or for approval, which may indicate a streamlined and efficient submission process.
