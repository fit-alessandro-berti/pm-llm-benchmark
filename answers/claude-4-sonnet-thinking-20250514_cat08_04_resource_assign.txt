# Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Resource Assignment Optimization at TechSolve Solutions

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### Individual Agent and Tier Performance Analysis

**Key Metrics and Analysis Approach:**

I would leverage the event log to extract comprehensive resource performance metrics using process mining techniques:

**Individual Agent Performance Metrics:**
- **Throughput Analysis:** Cases handled per agent per time period, segmented by ticket priority and category
- **Processing Time Distribution:** Mean, median, and variance of activity durations by agent and ticket type
- **First-Call Resolution Rate:** Percentage of L1 tickets resolved without escalation, calculated as: `(Tickets resolved at L1 / Total tickets assigned to L1 agent) * 100`
- **Reassignment Frequency:** Number of reassignments initiated by each agent, indicating potential skill mismatches
- **Skill Utilization Efficiency:** Ratio of tickets requiring specific skills vs. agent's documented capabilities

**Tier-Level Performance Analysis:**
- **Escalation Rate by Tier:** L1L2 and L2L3 escalation patterns by ticket category
- **Queue Time Analysis:** Time between assignment and work start, indicating capacity constraints
- **Cross-tier Handover Efficiency:** Analysis of handover quality using subsequent reassignment rates

**Process Mining Techniques Implementation:**

**Resource Interaction Analysis:**
Using social network analysis on the event log, I would create handover networks where:
- Nodes represent agents/tiers
- Edges represent ticket handovers
- Edge weights indicate handover frequency and associated delays
- Network centrality measures identify bottleneck agents and inefficient routing patterns

**Role Discovery Analysis:**
Apply organizational mining algorithms to identify:
- Actual vs. intended role boundaries (e.g., L1 agents handling L3-level tasks)
- Skill-based clustering of agents based on ticket resolution patterns
- Identification of "super-users" who handle disproportionately complex cases

**Skill Utilization Analysis:**
Create skill-demand matrices by:
- Mapping required skills to agent capabilities for each case
- Calculating skill utilization rates: `(Tickets requiring skill X handled by agents with skill X) / (Total tickets requiring skill X)`
- Identifying over-qualified assignments: Specialists handling basic tickets that could be resolved by lower-tier agents

### Assignment Pattern Discovery

**Conformance Checking Against Intended Logic:**
- Model the intended round-robin assignment process
- Compare actual assignment sequences with expected patterns
- Identify deviations indicating manual interventions or system failures
- Quantify conformance rates by ticket priority and category

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### Systematic Bottleneck Identification

**Skill-Specific Bottlenecks:**
Using process maps colored by waiting times, I would identify:
- **Critical Skill Shortages:** Skills with consistently high queue times (e.g., >30 minutes for P2 tickets)
- **Skill Mismatch Delays:** Cases where initial assignments lack required skills, measured by reassignment frequency within 2 hours of assignment

**Quantified Impact Analysis:**

**Reassignment Impact Calculation:**
```
Average delay per reassignment = (Time between reassignment trigger and new assignment) / Total reassignments
```
Based on the event log pattern, each reassignment appears to introduce 15-30 minutes of delay.

**SLA Breach Correlation:**
- Segment cases into SLA-compliant vs. breached
- Apply decision tree analysis to identify resource assignment factors most correlated with breaches
- Expected finding: >2 reassignments correlate with 70%+ SLA breach probability

**Specific Bottleneck Scenarios:**

1. **L1 Over-escalation:** If >40% of L1 tickets escalate, indicating insufficient empowerment or training
2. **Specialist Underutilization:** L3 agents handling L1-complexity tasks, reducing overall throughput
3. **Sequential Assignment Delays:** Cases stuck in dispatcher queues due to unavailable qualified agents

### Performance Degradation Patterns

**Peak Time Analysis:**
- Identify time periods with highest reassignment rates
- Correlate with agent availability and workload distribution
- Expected finding: 9-11 AM and 2-4 PM showing 2x normal reassignment rates

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### Variant Analysis for Assignment Quality

**Successful vs. Problematic Case Comparison:**

I would segment cases into:
- **Smooth Assignment (SA):** 1 reassignment, resolved within SLA
- **Problematic Assignment (PA):** >2 reassignments or SLA breach

**Key Differentiating Factors Analysis:**

**Decision Mining Application:**
Using decision tree algorithms on case attributes:
- **Ticket Characteristics:** Priority, category, required skill complexity score
- **Assignment Context:** Agent current workload, time of day, skill match accuracy
- **Initial Classification Quality:** Correlation between initially assigned skill and final resolution skill

**Expected Root Causes:**

1. **Inadequate Skill Profiling:**
   - Agents' documented skills don't reflect actual capabilities
   - No proficiency levels (basic/intermediate/expert) within skills

2. **Poor Initial Ticket Triaging:**
   - 30-40% of tickets initially categorized incorrectly
   - Required skill identification accuracy <60%

3. **Static Assignment Rules:**
   - Round-robin ignoring real-time workload and skill availability
   - No consideration of ticket complexity vs. agent experience

4. **Insufficient L1 Empowerment:**
   - L1 agents escalating cases they could potentially resolve with additional tools/training

### Process Discovery for Assignment Decisions

**Assignment Decision Tree Mining:**
Extract decision patterns from dispatcher/system assignment logs:
- If P1 ticket  Immediate assignment to any available L2/L3
- If specific skill required  Check availability  If none, assign to closest skill match
- Reveal hidden decision logic through frequent pattern mining

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Intelligent Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting

**Problem Addressed:** Skill mismatches and inefficient specialist utilization

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Enhanced Skill Matrix:** Implement 3-level proficiency scoring (Basic=1, Intermediate=2, Expert=3) for each agent-skill combination
- **Dynamic Skill Scoring:** Adjust proficiency scores based on resolution success rates and time-to-resolution metrics
- **Weighted Assignment Algorithm:**
  ```
  Assignment Score = (Skill Match * Proficiency Level * Agent Availability) / Current Workload
  ```

**Data Requirements:**
- Historical resolution success rates by agent-skill combination
- Real-time agent workload and availability status
- Ticket complexity scoring based on historical similar cases

**Expected Benefits:**

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Real-time Capacity Monitoring:** Track each agent's current case load, estimated completion times, and availability windows
- **Predictive Queue Management:** Use historical patterns to predict case resolution times and plan assignments accordingly

  ```
  Workload Factor = (Current Cases * Average Resolution Time) + Predicted Incoming Volume
  ```

**Data Requirements:**
