# Hospital Patient Management Process Tree Implementation

I'll implement the complex hospital patient management process as a process tree using the pm4py library. Let me break down the process and then construct the tree.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Create the root process tree (main sequence of the entire process)
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# 1. Initial sequence: Arrival -> Registration -> Intake Assessment
arrival = ProcessTree(label="A", parent=root)
registration = ProcessTree(label="RG", parent=root)
intake_assessment = ProcessTree(label="IA", parent=root)

# 2. Triage sequence: Triage Interview -> Triage Classification
triage_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
triage_interview = ProcessTree(label="TI", parent=triage_sequence)
triage_classification = ProcessTree(label="TC", parent=triage_sequence)
triage_sequence.children.append(triage_interview)
triage_sequence.children.append(triage_classification)

# 3. Initial diagnostic choice: Comprehensive ECG XOR Full Blood Panel
initial_diagnostic = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
comprehensive_ecg = ProcessTree(label="CE", parent=initial_diagnostic)
full_blood_panel = ProcessTree(label="FBP", parent=initial_diagnostic)
initial_diagnostic.children.append(comprehensive_ecg)
initial_diagnostic.children.append(full_blood_panel)

# 4. Treatment loop
treatment_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=root)

# First part of the loop (Specialist Consultation)
specialist_consultation = ProcessTree(label="SC", parent=treatment_loop)

# Second part of the loop (Treatment choice + Re-diagnostic)
loop_body = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=treatment_loop)

# Treatment choice: Targeted Medication XOR Specialized Physical Therapy
treatment_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=loop_body)
targeted_medication = ProcessTree(label="TM", parent=treatment_choice)
specialized_therapy = ProcessTree(label="SPT", parent=treatment_choice)
treatment_choice.children.append(targeted_medication)
treatment_choice.children.append(specialized_therapy)

# Re-diagnostic test choice
re_diagnostic = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=loop_body)
followup_ecg = ProcessTree(label="FCE", parent=re_diagnostic)
followup_blood = ProcessTree(label="FBA", parent=re_diagnostic)
re_diagnostic.children.append(followup_ecg)
re_diagnostic.children.append(followup_blood)

# Add treatment choice and re-diagnostic to loop body
loop_body.children.append(treatment_choice)
loop_body.children.append(re_diagnostic)

# Add specialist consultation and loop body to treatment loop
treatment_loop.children.append(specialist_consultation)
treatment_loop.children.append(loop_body)
# Third part of the loop is tau (implicit)

# 5. Advanced diagnostics and counseling (parallel)
advanced_parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
advanced_imaging = ProcessTree(label="AI", parent=advanced_parallel)
nutritional_counseling = ProcessTree(label="NC", parent=advanced_parallel)
advanced_parallel.children.append(advanced_imaging)
advanced_parallel.children.append(nutritional_counseling)

# 6. Final administrative sequence
final_admin_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
followup_scheduling = ProcessTree(label="FAS", parent=final_admin_sequence)
discharge_instructions = ProcessTree(label="DDI", parent=final_admin_sequence)
final_admin_sequence.children.append(followup_scheduling)
final_admin_sequence.children.append(discharge_instructions)

# 7. Final administrative and financial clearances (parallel)
final_parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
billing = ProcessTree(label="BL", parent=final_parallel)
insurance_claims = ProcessTree(label="ICP", parent=final_parallel)
medical_records = ProcessTree(label="MRF", parent=final_parallel)
final_parallel.children.append(billing)
final_parallel.children.append(insurance_claims)
final_parallel.children.append(medical_records)

# Add all main components to the root
root.children.append(arrival)
root.children.append(registration)
root.children.append(intake_assessment)
root.children.append(triage_sequence)
root.children.append(initial_diagnostic)
root.children.append(treatment_loop)
root.children.append(advanced_parallel)
root.children.append(final_admin_sequence)
root.children.append(final_parallel)

# The process tree is now complete
print("Hospital Patient Management Process Tree constructed successfully")
```

## Process Tree Structure Explanation

The implemented process tree follows the complex hospital patient management scenario with these key components:

1. **Initial Patient Processing**: Sequential activities for arrival, registration, and intake assessment.

2. **Triage Process**: A sequence of triage interview followed by triage classification.

3. **Initial Diagnostic**: An exclusive choice between comprehensive ECG or full blood panel.

4. **Treatment Loop**: A loop structure that includes:
   - Specialist consultation
   - An exclusive choice between targeted medication or specialized physical therapy
   - Re-diagnostic testing (either follow-up ECG or blood analysis)
   - The loop continues until results are normal (implicit tau exit condition)

5. **Advanced Diagnostics**: Parallel execution of advanced imaging and nutritional counseling.

6. **Final Administrative Steps**: Sequential scheduling of follow-up appointments and providing discharge instructions.

7. **Final Clearances**: Parallel execution of billing, insurance claims processing, and medical records finalization.

This process tree accurately models the complex patient journey through the hospital system, capturing all decision points, sequential dependencies, parallel activities, and the treatment loop as specified in the requirements.
