The figure illustrates a small healthcare workflow modeled with proclets and their message channels.

- Part (a): Two proclet classes interact.
  - Lab visit (left): doctor enters an order, a lab assistant takes the blood sample, the visit receives a lab result, judges it, and either concludes “everything fine” and sends a report or requests the tests to be done again and waits for an updated result.
  - Lab test (right): a chemical analyst performs the test, makes a report, and, if asked, performs the test again and provides an updated report before finishing the lab test.
  - The proclets communicate via two channels:
    - Order system: used to create a lab-test case from a lab-visit order.
    - HIS: used to send results/updated reports back to the visit and to handle re-test requests.

- Part (b): A simple class diagram shows the relationship: a Lab visit requires one or more Lab tests (1..1 to 1..*).

- Part (c): Example “performative” (a message instance): at 11:00 the Lab visit sends, via the Order system channel, a create request to the Lab test with content like “Can you perform an HGB test for John?”, marked as a private, outgoing message.
