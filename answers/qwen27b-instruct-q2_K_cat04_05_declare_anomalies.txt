Based on the provided constraints, here are some potential anomalies:

### 1\. Ambiguous Constraints

- **'Alternate response:', 'Chain response:'** These seem to be a bit ambiguous since they both refer to different sequences of events (`('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')`, etc.). It's unclear whether they imply that these events must alternate directly or sequentially.

### 2\. Overlapping Constraints

- **Co-Existence Constraint:** The Co-existence constraint appears to overlap significantly with the "Responded Existence" constraint since it seems to suggest a scenario where one event occurrence requires another simultaneously (`'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'; `'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled`; etc.). This might lead to confusion regarding whether simultaneous occurrences are allowed alongside sequential ones.

### 3\. Ambiguous Successions

- **Succession Constraints:** The succession constraints seem to be quite ambiguous when they refer directly (`'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`, `'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`), suggesting a straightforward sequence without much ambiguity between the events involved (`'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'`). However, the clarity diminishes with overlapping or chaining relations which aren’t clearly specified.

### Recommendations:

- **Clarify the meanings:** Specifically clarify the differences intended behind `'Alternate response:'`, `'Chain response:'`, `'Alternate precedence:'`, etc., clarifying whether these terms are referring sequentially ordered events vs simultaneous ones.
  
- **Revisit Co-Existence Constraint Clarification:** Clearly differentiate between `Co-existence` and other existence constraints (`Existence`, `Non Co-Existence`) regarding the simultaneity involved.
  
- **Distinct Successions:** Define exactly what is meant by `Succession`: if it implies a sequential order vs chain response. The terms should clearly differentiate between them especially when referring chains of dependencies that don't have an inherent natural direction.

It would be helpful to confirm these clarifications with your process model developer or team member who created this model since the context might differ slightly based on interpretation differences present in constraints used during modeling phases
