Based on the provided process variants, I've proposed a list of 20 relevant questions with a confidence score for each. The confidence score indicates how likely the question is to provide valuable insights into the process (1-5, where 5 is highly likely).

1. What is the average duration of the entire process? (Confidence: 5)
2. What is the most common path taken by employees when submitting declarations? (Confidence: 5)
3. Which role takes the longest to approve declarations on average? (Confidence: 4)
4. What is the rejection rate for declarations submitted by employees? (Confidence: 4)
5. Which stage of the process has the highest rejection rate? (Confidence: 4)
6. How many declarations are resubmitted after being rejected? (Confidence: 4)
7. What is the average time spent on declarations that are eventually rejected? (Confidence: 4)
8. Are there any bottlenecks in the process that cause delays? (Confidence: 4)
9. What is the purpose of the "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" step? (Confidence: 3)
10. How many employees are involved in the declaration submission process? (Confidence: 3)
11. What is the role of the "MISSING" entity in the process? (Confidence: 3)
12. Are there any differences in approval rates between different declaration types? (Confidence: 3)
13. How does the process handle multiple rejections and resubmissions? (Confidence: 3)
14. What is the average time spent on declarations that are approved at the first submission? (Confidence: 3)
15. Are there any seasonal or periodic patterns in declaration submissions? (Confidence: 3)
16. How do the approval rates of different roles (e.g., administration, budgets owners, supervisors) compare? (Confidence: 3)
17. What is the impact of declaration rejections on employee morale and productivity? (Confidence: 2)
18. Are there any areas where automation could improve the process efficiency? (Confidence: 2)
19. How does the process currently handle exceptions or special cases? (Confidence: 2)
20. Are there any opportunities to reduce the number of steps or handovers in the process? (Confidence: 2)

The confidence scores are based on the available process data and the potential for each question to reveal
