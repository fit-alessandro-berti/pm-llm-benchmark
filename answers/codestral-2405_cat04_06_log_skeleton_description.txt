Based on the given information, the process can be described as follows:

1. An employee submits a declaration for approval, which can be approved by the administration, the supervisor, or the pre-approver, or it can be rejected by one of these entities. If the declaration is rejected by the pre-approver, it can either be rejected by the missing entity or the budget owner. If it's rejected by the administration, it can be rejected by the budget owner or the pre-approver. If it's rejected by the supervisor, it can be rejected by the pre-approver or the supervisor.

2. Depending on the outcome of the approval process, the declaration may be saved by the employee, approved by the administration, approved by the budget owner, approved by the pre-approver, or finally approved by the supervisor.

3. If the declaration is approved by the supervisor or the pre-approver, the request for payment can be made. If the payment is handled, it cannot be rejected by the employee.

4. A declaration can be rejected by the employee multiple times, but each rejection will result in a new submission process.

5. Certain activities cannot occur together, such as the declaration for approval by the supervisor and the declaration rejected by the administration, or the declaration saved by the employee and the declaration rejected by the administration.

6. The process also limits the number of occurrences for each activity in a case.

7. There are also constraints for the sequence of activities, such as the declaration for approval by the administration must follow the declaration submitted by the employee, and the declaration for approval by the supervisor must be followed by the declaration rejected by missing.

This process seems to be a workflow management system for handling declarations that need approval from different entities. It seems to provide flexibility for the approval process to be handled by different entities and also includes a mechanism for handling rejections and subsequent submissions. The constraints are used to ensure the correct sequence of activities and to prevent certain combinations of activities from occurring together.
