## Identified Anomalies in the DECLARE Model

### 1\. Contradictory Constraint: Non-coexistence vs. Mandatory Steps
- **Non-coexistence (E, C)** explicitly prohibits the coexistence of "Evaluate Claim (E)" and "Close Claim (C)" within the same claim instance.
- However, business process logic typically mandates evaluation of a claim ("E") before it can logically be closed ("C"). Thus, these two constraints conflict directly.

### 2\. Responded Existence (E  A) Without Clear Definition of Mandate
- Constraint "Responded_existence" states that whenever activity "Evaluate Claim (E)" occurs, the activity "Assign Adjuster (A)" should also eventually occur.
- The intended logic typically dictates chronological ordering ("A" assigned before "E" evaluated), yet the existing constraint only demands existence (not precedence), potentially allowing evaluation before assignment or assignment occurring after evaluation.

### 3\. Missing Precedence Constraints Between Core Steps
- Activities like "Approve (P)" or "Notify (N)" are entirely missing explicit precedence or existence constraints. This oversight enables illogical sequences (e.g., closing claims without approval or notifying customer without claim approval).

## Hypotheses for Existence of Anomalous Constraints

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Requirements:** 
   - Stakeholders or analysts might have incorrectly documented requirements, leading to contradictory constraints. For instance, misunderstanding the relationship between evaluation and closing claims could lead to constraints unintentionally prohibiting their coexistence.

2. **Incremental Policy Changes:**
   - Gradual policy updates might have modified certain process expectations without revising previous constraints, causing outdated constraints (non-coexistence) to linger alongside newer expectations (responded existence and precedence).

3. **Technical or Data Quality Issues:**
   - Poor data quality or incomplete tracing information may have led the DECLARE model extraction process to incorrectly infer constraints. For example, missing event timestamps or incomplete claim events may mislead model discovery algorithms into introducing contradictory rules.

4. **Operational Pressure Leading to Shortcutting:**
   - Operational time-pressure or workload constraints may lead staff to circumvent required steps temporarily, influencing DECLARE mining algorithms to include contradictory logic that reflects irregular or shortcut processes rather than desired practices.

## Proposed SQL Queries for Verification of Anomalies

### 1\. Claims Closed Without Evaluation
Check practically existing cases where claims sequences include "Close Claim (C)" but lack any "Evaluate Claim (E)" activity.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claim_events c
WHERE c.activity = 'C'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
);
```

### 2\. Claims Containing Both "Evaluate" and "Close" Actions (Violating Non-coexistence)
Determines cases that violate the existing non-coexistence constraint ("E" and "C" occurring together):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claim_events c
WHERE c.activity = 'C' 
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
);
```

### 3\. Claims with "Evaluate" Activity Without Assigned Adjuster (Check Responded Existence Violations)
Confirm whether there exist evaluation activities without corresponding adjuster assignment:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT e.claim_id
FROM claim_events e
WHERE e.activity = 'E'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = e.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
);
```

### 4\. Check Chronological Orders of Steps (Assignment before Evaluation)
Verify if claims are evaluated before adjuster assignment, indicating logical inconsistencies regarding process timelines:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT e.claim_id
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events a ON e.claim_id = a.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND a.activity = 'A'
AND e.timestamp < a.timestamp;
```

### 5\. Claims Closed Before Approval and Notification Steps
Verify if any claims reach "Close" without prior activities of "Approval (P)" or "Notification (N)", indicating missing necessary workflow constraints:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claim_events c
WHERE c.activity = 'C'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce 
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity IN ('P', 'N')
);
```
