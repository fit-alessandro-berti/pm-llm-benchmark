1. Why was Malaysia selected as the central assembly location, and what trade-offs were evaluated against alternatives like Vietnam or Mexico?

2. How are component shortages or geopolitical disruptions (e.g., Taiwan Strait tensions) mitigated within the parallel component procurement branches?

3. What criteria determine whether a failed unit during Quality Checks is reworked versus scrapped, and how is that decision optimized for cost and sustainability?

4. How does the 24/7 assembly operation balance labor regulations, worker well-being, and productivity across different cultural and legal environments?

5. What KPIs are used to measure the efficiency of the parallel component sourcing gateways, and how are supplier performance benchmarks enforced?

6. Why are air freight and sea freight treated as mutually exclusive paths post-packing, rather than dynamically allocated based on real-time demand or inventory levels?

7. How is regulatory compliance (e.g., FCC, CE, RoHS) synchronized across markets before shipment, and who owns accountability when clearance fails?

8. What mechanisms exist to synchronize inventory monitoring with real-time sales data, and how agile is the system in triggering supplier order adjustments?

9. How are regional distribution centers empowered to make localized decisions (e.g., reallocating stock between Europe and LatAm) without central approval?

10. What role does predictive analytics play in deciding between “Adjust Orders to Suppliers” versus “Proceed to Next Sales Cycle” at the final gateway?

11. How are environmental impacts (e.g., carbon footprint of air freight vs. sea freight) quantified and factored into the logistics split decision?

12. What contingency plans exist if one component sourcing branch (e.g., OLED screens from South Korea) is delayed, and how does that affect the parallel join logic?

13. How is intellectual property protected during global component shipping and assembly, especially when proprietary designs cross multiple jurisdictions?

14. In what ways could blockchain or IoT tracking enhance transparency and trust across the parallel and sequential process segments?

15. How are cultural and language barriers addressed in communication between R&D (likely in HQ), component suppliers, and assembly teams in Malaysia?

16. What feedback loops exist between regional distribution centers and the Market Research phase to inform future product iterations or feature sets?

17. How is the “Rework or Scrap” decision communicated upstream to R&D or component suppliers to drive design or quality improvements?

18. Could the process benefit from collapsing the two parallel gateways (post-assembly distribution and post-component sourcing) into more dynamic, event-driven workflows?

19. How are VIP/pre-order customers prioritized without disrupting the broader distribution flow, and what SLAs govern their direct shipment pathway?

20. What ethical considerations (e.g., labor practices, conflict minerals, e-waste) are embedded in supplier selection and process design, and how are they audited?
