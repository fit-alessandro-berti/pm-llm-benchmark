### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

**Process Mining Application:**

To analyze the historical scheduling performance of Precision Parts Inc., we will leverage process mining techniques on the MES event logs. The goal is to reconstruct the actual job flow and task execution sequences across different machines.

**Techniques and Metrics:**

- **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
  - Use process mining tools to extract the start and end times of each job.
  - Calculate job flow time (time from release to completion), lead time (time from release to due date), and makespan (total time to complete all jobs).
  - Analyze distributions to identify variability and outliers.

- **Task Waiting Times:**
  - Track the time tasks spend in queues before processing.
  - Calculate average waiting times for each work center/machine.
  - Identify patterns or bottlenecks causing excessive waiting.

- **Resource Utilization:**
  - Measure productive time, idle time, and setup time for each machine and operator.
  - Calculate utilization rates to identify underutilized or overloaded resources.

- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
  - Analyze logs to determine setup durations based on job sequences.
  - Use statistical methods to model setup time variations depending on the previous job processed.

- **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
  - Compare actual completion times with due dates.
  - Calculate tardiness metrics (frequency and magnitude of delays).
  - Assess schedule adherence by measuring deviations from planned schedules.

- **Impact of Disruptions:**
  - Identify events like breakdowns and priority changes.
  - Analyze their impact on job flow, resource utilization, and KPIs.
  - Quantify delays and increased WIP due to disruptions.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

**Key Pathologies:**

- **Bottleneck Resources:**
  - Use bottleneck analysis to identify machines with high utilization and long queue times.
  - Quantify their impact on overall throughput and lead times.

- **Poor Task Prioritization:**
  - Analyze variant paths of on-time vs. late jobs.
  - Identify instances where low-priority jobs were prioritized over high-priority ones.

- **Suboptimal Sequencing:**
  - Examine sequence-dependent setup times to identify inefficient job orderings.
  - Calculate additional setup time incurred due to poor sequencing.

- **Starvation of Downstream Resources:**
  - Analyze resource contention periods to identify starvation issues.
  - Determine if upstream bottlenecks cause downstream resource underutilization.

- **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:**
  - Monitor WIP levels over time to detect oscillations.
  - Analyze scheduling variability as a potential cause of the bullwhip effect.

**Process Mining Evidence:**

- Use process mining tools to visualize and quantify these pathologies.
- Generate reports and dashboards to highlight inefficiencies and areas for improvement.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

**Potential Root Causes:**

- **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:**
  - Static rules fail to adapt to dynamic shop floor conditions.
  - Lack of consideration for multiple factors like due dates, priorities, and resource loads.

- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
  - Inadequate real-time data on machine availability, queue lengths, and job progress.
  - Leads to suboptimal scheduling decisions.

- **Inaccurate Task Duration Estimations:**
  - Reliance on inaccurate or outdated task duration estimates.
  - Results in unrealistic schedules and missed deadlines.

- **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:**
  - Failure to optimize job sequences based on setup time dependencies.
  - Increases total setup time and delays.

- **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers:**
  - Lack of coordination leads to misalignment in scheduling decisions.
  - Causes delays and increased WIP.

- **Inadequate Strategies for Disruptions:**
  - Poor response to unplanned breakdowns and urgent orders.
  - exacerbates existing existing and further disrupts schedules.

**Differentiating Issues:**

- Use process mining to separate scheduling logic flaws from resource capacity limitations.
- Analyze historical data to identify patterns of variability and capacity constraints.
