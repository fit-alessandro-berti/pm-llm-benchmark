Below is a structured, end-to-end plan to mine your six-month event log, diagnose the worst queues in the outpatient flow, uncover root causes, propose targeted fixes, weigh the trade-offs and define how you’ll know you’ve succeeded.

---  
1. Queue Identification and Characterization  
   a. Define Waiting Time  
      • For each case (visit) and each pair of consecutive activities AB, waiting time = Timestamp_START(B) – Timestamp_COMPLETE(A).  
      • E.g. registrationnurse wait = nurseassessment_START – registration_COMPLETE.  
   b. Key Metrics per Queue (AB)  
      – Average (mean) wait  
      – Median wait  
      – 90th percentile wait (identifies longtail delays)  
      – Maximum wait  
      – Queue frequency: #cases that traverse AB per day/week  
      – #cases exceeding a servicelevel threshold (e.g. waits >15 min)  
   c. Ranking & Selection of Critical Queues  
      • Rank by average wait × frequency (so even a medium wait that affects many cases surfaces).  
      • Flag queues with 90th-percentile wait > X (e.g. >30 min) or >20% of cases breaching threshold.  
      • Overlay patient-type/urgency: highlight if urgent/new patients disproportionately hit long waits.  
       Focus first on queues with both high volume and high average/90th percentile waits.

2. Root Cause Analysis  
   a. Potential Root-Cause Categories  
      1. Resource bottlenecks:  
         – High utilization (>85%) of staff/room/equipment immediately before queue.  
      2. Activity-handover delays:  
         – Poor synchronization: e.g. doctor finishes early but next tech isn’t available.  
      3. Servicetime variability:  
         – Large variance in upstream activity duration creates batching downstream.  
      4. Scheduling policies:  
         – Over-booking certain slots, mixing new/follow-up without buffers.  
      5. Arrival patterns:  
         – High arrival peaks (e.g. 9–10 am) create burst queues.  
      6. Patient-segment differences:  
         – Urgent vs. normal walks in out of schedule.  
   b. Process-Mining Techniques to Pinpoint Causes  
      • Resource Utilization Analysis: compute per-resource busy times vs. idle times; identify over- and under-utilized roles.  
      • Bottleneck (Performance) Analysis: visualize the “slowest” edges in the performance-annotated process map.  
      • Variant Analysis: compare the top-10% longest traces vs. shortest; see which branches or resources differ.  
      • Conformance/Deviation Checking: find deviations from the “ideal” flow (e.g., missing parallel steps).  
      • Cross-Case Correlation: relate peaks in registration volume to downstream queue lengths.

3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies  
   Strategy 1: Dynamic, Slot-Based Appointment Scheduling  
     • TargetsRegistrationNurse and NurseDoctor queues  
     • Root CauseMorning batch arrivals; high service variance causes downstream clogs  
     • Data SupportEventlog arrival histograms show 50% of patients 8:45–9:15 am, combined with 20% tails in registration times  
     • SolutionIntroduce uneven slotting:  
         – Short slots (10 min) for follow-ups, long slots (20 min) for new/urgent  
         – Buffer zones every 4 slots for catching up  
     • Expected ImpactReduce 90thpercentile nurse-wait by ~25%, average overall lead time by 10%  
     
   Strategy 2: Flexible “Float” Nurse/Clerk During Peak Periods  
     • TargetsResource bottleneck at Nurse Assessment and Check-out queues  
     • Root CauseUtilization >90% for Nurse 1 between 9–11 am; clerks B & C overloaded at check-out  
     • Data SupportResource utilization chart shows 8:30–11:15 heavy load with zero idle time  
     • SolutionCross-train one back-office staff as “floater” to support triage or checkout from 8:45–11:15.  
     • Expected ImpactAverage nurse queue drops by 40%, checkout queue drops by 50% during peak.  
     
   Strategy 3: Parallelize Diagnostics & Consultation Handoffs  
     • TargetsDoctorECG/Blood-test and TestConsult queues  
     • Root CauseSerial handoff: patient must return to front desk between steps, causing walking and waiting delays  
     • Data SupportMedian inter-activity wait 15 min just for handoff registration after tests  
     • SolutionIntroduce mobile check-in kiosks at test rooms or tabletbased real-time status updates so clerks push patients straight to next activity  
     • Expected ImpactEliminate 10 min extra handoff waits; shorten visit by ~8% on average.

4. Trade-offs and Constraints  
   • Shifting the Bottleneck  
     – Adding staff to one step may push queues downstream; strategy must be holistic.  
   • Cost vs. Benefit  
     – Float staff incur labor costs; validate ROI by projecting increased throughput and potential revenue.  
   • Impact on Care Quality  
     – Faster flows must not shorten clinical time; ensure parallelization doesn’t overload doctors.  
   • Staff Workload & Satisfaction  
     – Staggered schedules or overtime can fatigue staff; engage them in co-design and rotate float roles.  
   • Balancing Objectives  
     – Use simulation (e.g. discreteevent, calibrated on your event log) to test scenarios before roll-out.  
     – Adopt a pilot & learn approach: implement one change in a subset of clinics/days, measure, then scale.

5. Measuring Success  
   a. KPIs (Post-Implementation)  
      – Average and 90th percentile wait per critical queue (registrationnurse, nursedoctor, doctortest, testcheckout)  
      – Overall average visit duration  
      – % visits over target SLA (e.g. >2 hours)  
      – Patient satisfaction scores (surveyed on wait times)  
      – Resource utilization rates (keep within 75–85% ideal band)  
   b. Ongoing Monitoring  
      • Build live dashboards fed by your event log (or real-time stream) showing trending KPIs by day/hour.  
      • Set alerts if any queue’s 90th percentile crosses warning thresholds.  
      • Quarterly variant re-analysis to detect new bottlenecks or shifts in patient patterns.  
      • Continuous-improvement cycle: measure  analyze deviations  refine scheduling/staffing.  

By following this queue-mining-led roadmap—calculating inter-activity waits, drilling into root causes with resource and variant analyses, deploying three concrete interventions, and then rigorously monitoring—you’ll both shorten patient wait times and sustain high-quality, cost-effective outpatient care.
