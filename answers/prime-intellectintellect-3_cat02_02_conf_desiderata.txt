We are given three cases (1, 2, 3) in an event log. We need to check each case against the normative rules and the desiderata.

**Normative Rules (Strict):**
The sequence must be: 
Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case

Ordering rules:
- Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
- Risk Assessment must occur before Loan Decision.
- Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision.
- If loan is approved, Finalize Documentation must occur before Close Case.
- If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case.

What is not allowed:
- Skipping activities in the required sequence.
- Changing the order (e.g., doing Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
- Performing Finalize Documentation after a rejection.
- Closing the case without following the decision logic.

**Desiderata (Recommended but not strict):**
- Credit Check should be completed within a short time window after the application is received (e.g., within 24 hours).
- The applicant should be informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision).
- It is encouraged to perform a Follow-up Call to the applicant sometime before closing the case.

Now, let's analyze each case.

---

**Case 1:**
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity              |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 1       | 2024-01-10 09:00    | Application Received  |
| 1       | 2024-01-10 09:30    | Credit Check          |
| 1       | 2024-01-10 10:00    | Risk Assessment       |
| 1       | 2024-01-10 11:00    | Loan Decision (Approved) |
| 1       | 2024-01-10 13:00    | Inform Applicant      |
| 1       | 2024-01-10 13:30    | Finalize Documentation|
| 1       | 2024-01-10 14:00    | Close Case            |

**Normative Check:**
- Sequence: 
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation (because approved)  Close Case: Correct.
- Order:
  - Credit Check (09:30) before Risk Assessment (10:00): Correct.
  - Risk Assessment (10:00) before Loan Decision (11:00): Correct.
  - Inform Applicant (13:00) after Loan Decision (11:00): Correct.
  - Approved: Finalize Documentation (13:30) before Close Case (14:00): Correct.
- No skipping, no reversal, no finalization after rejection: All good.

**Desiderata Check:**
- Credit Check: within 24 hours of application? Application at 09:00, Credit Check at 09:30 (same day, within 24 hours): Met.
- Inform Applicant: within 48 hours of loan decision? Loan Decision at 11:00, Inform at 13:00 (same day, within 2 hours): Met.
- Follow-up Call: Not present, but it's optional. So, no violation (just missing a recommendation).

**Conclusion for Case 1:**
- Normative: No violations.
- Desiderata: 
  - Credit Check timing: Met.
  - Inform timing: Met.
  - Follow-up Call: Not done (but optional).

---

**Case 2:**
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity              |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:00    | Application Received  |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:20    | Risk Assessment       | *(No prior Credit Check - violates normative)* |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:00    | Credit Check          |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:30    | Loan Decision (Rejected) |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:00    | Finalize Documentation| *(Not allowed after rejection)* |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:30    | Close Case            |

**Normative Check:**
- Sequence: 
  - The sequence is broken at the beginning: Risk Assessment is done before Credit Check. Also, the required activity Credit Check is missing before Risk Assessment? Actually, it is done later (at 09:00). But the order is wrong: Risk Assessment at 08:20, then Credit Check at 09:00. This violates the rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
- Additionally, the loan is rejected, but Finalize Documentation is performed. This is explicitly not allowed: "If loan is rejected, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation." Here, Finalize Documentation is done at 10:00 and then Close Case at 10:30.

**Violations:**
1. Order changed: Risk Assessment before Credit Check (violates ordering rule: Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment).
2. After rejection, Finalize Documentation is performed (violates the rule for rejected loans).

**Desiderata Check:**
- We don't need to check because normative violations are already present and severe. But for completeness:
  - Credit Check: within 24 hours? Application at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00 (next activity after Risk Assessment, but time-wise within 24 hours? Actually, it's 1 hour later, so within 24 hours: Met? But note: the activity is out of order, but the time from application to credit check is 1 hour, which is within 24 hours. However, the normative violation is about order, not time. So for desiderata, we only care about time if the activity is done. But note: the credit check is done after the risk assessment, which is a normative violation, but the time from application to credit check is 1 hour, so if we ignore the order, the time is okay. However, the desiderata says "after the application is received", meaning we consider the time from the application event. So: 08:00 to 09:00 is 1 hour -> within 24 hours: Met.
  - Inform Applicant: not present? Wait, in the log for case 2, we don't see "Inform Applicant". This is a violation of the normative rule! The rule says: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome." So we are missing "Inform Applicant" entirely. This is a normative violation. But the log doesn't show it. So we must note that.

Wait, let me reexamine the log for case 2: 
- Activities: Application Received, Risk Assessment, Credit Check, Loan Decision, Finalize Documentation, Close Case.
- Missing: "Inform Applicant". This is a required activity. So another normative violation.

**Additional Violation in Case 2:**
3. Missing "Inform Applicant": The process must inform the applicant after the loan decision. This activity is absent.

**Desiderata for Case 2:**
- Credit Check: time from application (08:00) to credit check (09:00) is 1 hour -> within 24 hours: Met (if we consider the activity done, but note it was done after risk assessment, which is wrong, but the time is okay).
- Inform Applicant: missing entirely -> but since it's missing, we cannot check the time. However, the desiderata about informing within 48 hours of loan decision is irrelevant because the activity is missing. But the normative rule requires it, so we already have a violation.
- Follow-up Call: not present (optional).

**Conclusion for Case 2:**
- Normative violations:
  1. Risk Assessment done before Credit Check (order violation).
  2. Missing "Inform Applicant" (skipping a required activity).
  3. Finalize Documentation after rejection (violation of decision logic).
- Desiderata: 
  - Credit Check timing: Met (if we consider the time, but note the activity is out of order).
  - Inform timing: Not applicable (missing activity).
  - Follow-up Call: Not done.

**Case 3:**
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity              |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 3       | 2024-01-12 09:00    | Application Received  |
| 3       | 2024-01-14 10:00    | Credit Check          | *(Happened more than 24 hours later - just a desideratum violation)* |
| 3       | 2024-01-14 11:00    | Risk Assessment       |
| 3       | 2024-01-14 12:00    | Loan Decision (Approved) |
| 3       | 2024-01-16 15:00    | Inform Applicant      | *(Later than recommended 48 hours - again a desideratum violation)* |
| 3       | 2024-01-17 09:00    | Finalize Documentation|
| 3       | 2024-01-17 10:00    | Close Case            |
| 3       | *(No Follow-up Call)* |                      |

**Normative Check:**
- Sequence: 
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation (because approved)  Close Case: Correct.
- Order:
  - Credit Check (14th 10:00) before Risk Assessment (14th 11:00): Correct.
  - Risk Assessment (14th 11:00) before Loan Decision (14th 12:00): Correct.
  - Inform Applicant (16th 15:00) after Loan Decision (14th 12:00): Correct (order is satisfied, even though there is a time gap).
  - Approved: Finalize Documentation (17th 09:00) before Close Case (17th 10:00): Correct.
- No skipping, no reversal, and no finalization after rejection (it's approved): All normative rules are satisfied.

**Desiderata Check:**
- Credit Check: within 24 hours? Application at 12th 09:00, Credit Check at 14th 10:00. 
  - Time difference: from 12th 09:00 to 14th 09:00 is 48 hours, then to 14th 10:00 is 49 hours. This is more than 24 hours -> violation of the recommended time.
- Inform Applicant: within 48 hours of loan decision? Loan Decision at 14th 12:00, Inform at 16th 15:00.
  - Time difference: from 14th 12:00 to 16th 12:00 is 48 hours, then to 16th 15:00 is 51 hours -> more than 48 hours -> violation.
- Follow-up Call: Not done (optional, so not a violation, but a missed recommendation).

**Conclusion for Case 3:**
- Normative: No violations.
- Desiderata: 
  - Credit Check timing: Violated (49 hours later).
  - Inform timing: Violated (51 hours later).
  - Follow-up Call: Not done (optional).

---

**Summary:**

1. **Violations of Normative Rules:**
   - **Case 1:** None.
   - **Case 2:** 
        - Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check (order violation).
        - Missing "Inform Applicant" (required activity skipped).
        - Finalize Documentation performed after a rejection (violation of decision logic).
   - **Case 3:** None.

2. **Failures to Meet Desiderata:**
   - **Case 1:** 
        - Follow-up Call not performed (optional, so not a failure per se, but a missed recommendation). 
        - (Note: the other two desiderata are met.)
   - **Case 2:** 
        - Credit Check timing: Met (1 hour after application) -> no violation. 
        - But note: the other desiderata are not met because "Inform Applicant" is missing and we cannot check its timing, and Follow-up Call is missing. However, the desiderata are only about timing and the optional follow-up. Since the activity "Inform Applicant" is missing, we don't have a timing for it. But the desiderata for informing only applies if the activity is done. So we can only say that the informing activity is missing, which is a normative violation, not a desideratum issue. For desiderata, we only note the timing of the activities that are present? Actually, the desiderata are independent: 
          - "Credit Check should be completed within a short time window after the application is received" -> we have the activity, and the time is 1 hour -> met.
          - "the applicant is informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision)" -> but the activity is missing, so we cannot check. However, the rule is about the activity if it is performed. Since it is not performed at all, we don't have a timing to check. So we don't mark this as a desideratum violation? But note: the desiderata are about the process, and if the activity is skipped, then we are not following the recommendation to inform promptly? Actually, the recommendation is about the timing of the activity, but the activity itself is required by normative rules. So the absence of the activity is a normative violation, not a desideratum. Therefore, for desiderata, we only consider the timing of the activities that are present and the optional follow-up. So for case 2, the desiderata for credit check is met, and the follow-up call is missing (optional). The informing activity is missing, but that's a normative issue. So for desiderata, case 2 has no timing violations (because the credit check was done in time) and no follow-up call (optional). 
        - However, note: the credit check was done after the risk assessment, but the time from application to credit check is 1 hour. The desiderata doesn't specify the order, only the time. So we can check the time independently of order? Yes. So the credit check was done 1 hour after application -> met.
   - **Case 3:** 
        - Credit Check: 49 hours after application -> violation (more than 24 hours).
        - Inform Applicant: 51 hours after loan decision -> violation (more than 48 hours).
        - Follow-up Call: Not done (optional).

3. **Suggestions for Interpretations/Justifications:**
   - **Case 2:** 
        - Why was Risk Assessment done before Credit Check? Maybe an error in the process execution, or perhaps a preliminary risk assessment was done quickly without the credit check, and then the credit check was done later. However, the normative rules require credit check first. This might be a mistake by the officer.
        - Why was "Inform Applicant" skipped? It could be an oversight, or perhaps the officer thought that since the loan was rejected, informing was not necessary? But the rules require informing regardless of approval or rejection.
        - Why was Finalize Documentation done after rejection? This activity is only for approved loans. It might be that the officer mistakenly thought that some documentation was needed even for rejection (like sending a rejection letter?) but the rule says not to finalize documentation after rejection. However, note: the activity "Finalize Documentation" might be specific to the approval process. The rejection might only require a simple notification. So this step should be skipped for rejection.

   - **Case 3:**
        - Why the delays? 
          - Credit Check: 49 hours later. Maybe the officer was busy or there was a weekend? (Check the dates: 12th (Friday) 09:00 to 14th (Monday) 10:00 -> includes weekend. So maybe the credit check was not available over the weekend. This is a common reason and might be acceptable in practice, but the desiderata recommend 24 hours (which might be interpreted as business hours). So it's a violation of the recommendation but not the strict rule.
          - Inform Applicant: 51 hours after loan decision. Similarly, maybe the officer was waiting for a manager's approval to send the letter? Or there was a backlog. Again, not a normative violation but a service level issue.

   - **General:** 
        - The absence of Follow-up Call in all cases is because it's optional and not enforced. It might be that the organization hasn't implemented that step yet or doesn't have the resources.

**Final Answer Structure:**

**1. Normative Violations:**
   - Case 1: None.
   - Case 2: 
        - Violation 1: Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check (at 08:20 vs 09:00).
        - Violation 2: Missing "Inform Applicant" activity.
        - Violation 3: Finalize Documentation performed after a rejection (at 10:00, before closing at 10:30).
   - Case 3: None.

**2. Desiderata Failures (suboptimal behavior):**
   - Case 1: 
        - No timing violations (credit check and informing are within recommended times).
        - Follow-up Call not performed (optional, so not a failure but a missed opportunity for better service).
   - Case 2: 
        - Credit Check: within 24 hours (1 hour after application) -> no violation.
        - Inform Applicant: missing (but this is a normative violation, not a desideratum failure). For desiderata, we only note the timing of activities that are present. Since the activity is missing, we don't have a timing to evaluate. So no desideratum violation for timing? However, the desiderata says "the applicant is informed promptly", which implies the activity must be done and then promptly. But since the activity is not done at all, we cannot check the timing. So we don't mark it as a desideratum failure? Actually, the desiderata are about the process when the activities are performed. So for case 2, we have a credit check that was done in time, and we don't have an informing activity to check. So no desideratum timing violation. But note: the follow-up call is missing (optional).
   - Case 3: 
        - Credit Check: 49 hours after application (more than 24 hours) -> violation.
        - Inform Applicant: 51 hours after loan decision (more than 48 hours) -> violation.
        - Follow-up Call: Not performed (optional).

**3. Interpretations/Justifications:**
   - Case 2 violations:
        - The out-of-order activities (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) might be due to an initial quick assessment without the credit report, and then the credit check was obtained later. However, the process requires the credit check first, so this is an error.
        - The missing "Inform Applicant" could be an oversight, especially if the officer assumed that the rejection was straightforward and didn't require formal notification? But the rules require it.
        - The Finalize Documentation after rejection might be a mistake: perhaps the officer thought that some minimal documentation (like a rejection notice) requires "finalizing", but the rule specifies that for rejection, we skip that step. This activity might be misnamed or the officer might have confused it with the informing step? But the informing step is separate and is missing.

   - Case 3 delays:
        - The credit check delay (49 hours) might be due to non-working days (if 12th is Friday and 14th is Monday, then it's about 2 working days). The recommendation of 24 hours might be for business hours, so including non-working time might be acceptable? But the rule doesn't specify, so we mark it as a violation of the recommendation.
        - The informing delay (51 hours) might be due to a backlog in the notification department or waiting for a physical letter to be printed and sent. This is suboptimal but not illegal.

   - Follow-up Call: Not done in any case. This might be because the organization hasn't adopted this best practice yet, or due to resource constraints.

**Note:** In case 2, we have multiple normative violations, which are severe. In case 3, only desiderata violations, which are minor.

### Analysis of Loan Application Process

---

#### **1. Normative Rule Violations**  
**Strict rules are violated in Case 2 only.**  
- **Case 1:** No violations. Sequence and logic align perfectly with normative rules.  
- **Case 2:** Three violations:  
  1. **Ordering violation:** Risk Assessment (08:20) performed **before** Credit Check (09:00).  
     - *Why?* Normative rules require Credit Check  Risk Assessment.  
  2. **Missing activity:** "Inform Applicant" is absent.  
     - *Why?* Required after Loan Decision (09:30).  
  3. **Logic violation:** Finalize Documentation (10:00) performed **after rejection**.  
     - *Why?* Rejected loans must skip finalization before closing.  
- **Case 3:** No violations. Sequence and logic comply with normative rules.  

---

#### **2. Desiderata Failures (Suboptimal Behavior)**  
**Desiderata are violated in Cases 1, 2, and 3, but are not severe.**  
- **Case 1:**  
  - **Follow-up Call missing** (optional best practice).  
  - *Other desiderata met:* Credit Check (0.5 hours after application) and Inform Applicant (2 hours after decision) are timely.  
- **Case 2:**  
  - **Credit Check timing met** (1 hour after application).  
  - **Follow-up Call missing** (optional).  
  - *Note:* "Inform Applicant" is missing entirely (normative violation), so its timing cannot be evaluated.  
- **Case 3:**  
  - **Credit Check delayed:** 49 hours after application (exceeds 24-hour recommendation).  
  - **Inform Applicant delayed:** 51 hours after decision (exceeds 48-hour recommendation).  
  - **Follow-up Call missing** (optional).  

---

#### **3. Interpretations/Justifications**  
- **Case 2 violations:**  
  - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check?**  
    *Interpretation:* An initial risk screening might have been done hastily without credit data, followed by a corrective credit check. This deviates from the strict sequence but reflects real-world pressures to expedite assessments.  
  - **Missing "Inform Applicant"?**  
    *Justification:* Oversight due to workload or assumption that rejection requires no formal notification. However, rules mandate informing applicants regardless of outcome.  
  - **Finalize Documentation after rejection?**  
    *Justification:* Misinterpretation of "documentation" as including rejection notices. Process guidelines clarify finalization is approval-specific.  

- **Case 3 delays:**  
  - **Credit Check delay (49 hours):**  
    *Justification:* Non-working days (e.g., weekend) between 12th (Friday) and 14th (Monday) may have delayed access to credit bureaus. Desiderata recommend 24 hours but do not account for external dependencies.  
  - **Inform Applicant delay (51 hours):**  
    *Justification:* Manual processes (e.g., printing/posting physical letters) or backlog in the notification team. While suboptimal, this does not break rules.  

- **Follow-up Call absence (all cases):**  
  *Justification:* Optional practice likely deprioritized due to resource constraints or lack of enforcement. Not a rule violation but a missed opportunity for applicant engagement.

### Summary  
| Case | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Failures |  
|------|------------------------|----------------------|  
| 1    | None                   | Follow-up Call missing |  
| 2    | **Yes** (3 violations) | Credit Check timing met; Follow-up Call missing |  
| 3    | None                   | Credit Check (49h), Inform (51h) delayed; Follow-up Call missing |  

**Key Takeaway:**  
- **Case 2** requires immediate corrective action for normative breaches (e.g., retraining, process audits).  
- **Case 3** needs operational improvements (e.g., automation for timely credit checks/notifications) but is compliant.  
- **Desiderata failures** highlight service gaps but are secondary to rule compliance.
