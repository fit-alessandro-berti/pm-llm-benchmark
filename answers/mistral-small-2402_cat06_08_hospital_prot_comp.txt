Based on the provided data, the main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups are:

1. Frequency of Process Variants: The frequency of process variants is significantly higher in the unprotected group compared to the protected group. This suggests that the unprotected group may have more patients and more diverse treatment paths.

2. Expert Examination and Thorough Examination: The unprotected group has more process variants that include Expert Examination and Thorough Examination, suggesting that this group may receive more comprehensive diagnostic procedures.

3. Treatment Successful vs. Treatment Unsuccessful: The protected group appears to have a higher proportion of process variants that end in "Treatment Successful". On the other hand, the unprotected group has more process variants that include "Treatment Unsuccessful", followed by a second diagnosis and treatment. This suggests that the unprotected group may have more complex cases or less successful treatments.

4. Discharge without Treatment: The unprotected group has a process variant where patients are simply discharged without any treatment, which is not present in the protected group.

5. Performance: The performance times (execution times) are similar across most process variants in both groups. However, without knowing the unit of time, it's hard to draw definitive conclusions.

These differences could be due to various factors such as the severity of health conditions, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status, etc. It's important to note that while these observations can be made based on the data, further analysis would be needed to determine the causes and implications of these differences.
