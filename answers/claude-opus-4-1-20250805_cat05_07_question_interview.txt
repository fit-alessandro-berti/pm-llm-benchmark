Thank you for that comprehensive overview of your property onboarding process. I have several follow-up questions to better understand the nuances and details:

## Initial Contact and Documentation Phase

1. When a property owner first contacts your regional office, what specific criteria determine whether you'll accept them as a client? Are there any types of properties or landlords you typically decline?

2. You mentioned the coordinator requests updates for missing or outdated documents - what defines "outdated" in this context, and what's the typical turnaround time landlords have to provide these updates?

3. What happens if a landlord can't provide certain required documentation? Are there alternative paths or is the process completely blocked?

## Property Manager Assignment

4. How do you handle situations where no property manager meets all the ideal criteria you mentioned? What's the prioritization hierarchy among workload, geographic specialization, property type experience, and track record?

5. Is there a formal handoff process between the property coordinator and the newly assigned property manager? What information gets transferred and how?

6. What happens if the introductory meeting between the property manager and landlord reveals incompatibilities or the landlord requests a different manager?

## Inspection and Marketing Preparation

7. You mentioned both photography and inspection happen after the property manager is assigned - do these always occur sequentially or can they happen in parallel? What drives that decision?

8. When inspection issues are found, who determines whether repairs are mandatory versus optional? What's the escalation path if the landlord refuses to address certain issues?

9. How long does the entire inspection-to-resolution cycle typically take, and what happens to the overall timeline if major repairs are needed?

## Tenant Selection and Lease Finalization

10. When multiple qualified tenants apply, you mentioned several negotiation factors - who has the final decision authority on tenant selection: the property manager, the landlord, or is it collaborative?

11. What happens if a selected tenant backs out after being chosen but before signing the lease? Do you maintain a backup list or restart the screening process?

12. Are there situations where a property might be "activated" in your rental portal but then need to be deactivated before finding a tenant? What triggers this?

## Quality Checks and Compliance

13. At what specific points can the compliance officer or financial analyst reject or require changes to the process? Can their interventions happen after a lease is already signed?

14. You mentioned "multiple decision points" throughout - which decisions can be made independently by individuals versus requiring approval from others or committees?

15. How do you handle urgent onboarding requests where the standard timeline won't work? Is there a fast-track process?

## Communication and Coordination

16. With so many stakeholders involved, how do you ensure critical information doesn't get lost between handoffs? Is there a central person orchestrating the entire process?

17. What triggers the transition from one phase to the next? Are these automatic based on task completion or do they require explicit approvals?

18. How do you handle situations where external parties (photographers, inspectors, contractors) cause delays? What's your contingency planning?

## Exceptions and Edge Cases

19. You mentioned properties requiring special insurance or custom lease clauses - at what point in the process are these special requirements identified and who manages these exceptions?

20. What happens if a property is partially ready (e.g., some units in a multi-unit building are ready but others aren't)? Can you onboard in phases?

21. How do you handle interstate or international landlords who can't be physically present for meetings or property walkthroughs?

## Process Completion and Ongoing Management

22. Once a tenant moves in, is there a formal handoff to ongoing property management, or does the same property manager continue? What changes in terms of responsibilities?

23. Looking back at completed onboardings, what are the most common reasons for delays or process failures, and how do you track these?

24. Is there a maximum time limit for the entire onboarding process after which you might cancel or renegotiate with the landlord?

These questions should help me understand not just the happy path through your process, but also how you handle variations, exceptions, and decision-making throughout the property onboarding lifecycle.
