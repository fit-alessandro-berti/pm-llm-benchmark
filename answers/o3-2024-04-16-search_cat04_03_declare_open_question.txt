Below is a business-oriented “walk-through” of what the DECLARE rules are doing, translated from constraint logic into the day-to-day reality of a regulated loan-approval department.  (Terms in italics are the DECLARE constraint names; terms in bold are the activities.)


1.  Core activities that MUST or MUST NOT occur

• existence(Receive_Application) + init(Receive_Application)  
  – The very first recorded event must be **Receive Application**. Every case therefore starts with a digital footprint that the customer’s request was formally logged.  
• existence(Gather_Additional_Documents)  
  – The lender is not allowed to make a decision without having at least one round of supporting evidence (pay stubs, tax returns, IDs, etc.).  
• absence(Proceed_Without_Compliance)  
  – The “nuclear” guard-rail: any attempt to bypass compliance is illegal and would violate policy, so it is flat-out banned from ever entering the trace.

Business / regulatory motive  
• Truth-in-Lending, anti-fraud (KYC/AML), and audit rules require a clearly identifiable start point and an auditable trail of documentation. “Proceed_Without_Compliance” embodies the nightmare scenario that auditors and regulators explicitly want to rule out.


2.  Counting rules that limit repetition

• exactly_one(Preliminary_Credit_Check)  
  – A bureau pull should be done only once so that the credit file is “fresh” and the applicant’s score is not repeatedly hit with hard inquiries. It also avoids conflicting risk assessments inside the same case.

Business / regulatory motive  
• The Fair Credit Reporting Act in the U.S. penalizes “unnecessary or excessive” pulls; exactly-one guarantees compliance and data consistency.


3.  Logical dependencies (“if A happens, B must also happen”)

• response(Receive_Application  Preliminary_Credit_Check)  
  – Intake automatically triggers the risk team to pull credit; an application cannot just sit in limbo.  
• succession(Preliminary_Credit_Check  Gather_Additional_Documents)  
  – Together, response + precedence ensure that (a) credit is done before document collection begins, and (b) document collection must eventually follow.  
• responded_existence(Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Quality_Assurance_Review)  
  – If an offer package is put together, there must be a downstream **Quality Assurance Review**; however, QA may also happen for other reasons, so the linkage is one-way.  
• coexistence(Gather_Additional_Documents  Authorize_Contract_Terms)  
  – You cannot approve terms without supporting paperwork, and if paperwork is gathered someone must eventually approve or reject terms. Each implies the other must appear somewhere in the trace.  
• precedence(Quality_Assurance_Review  Authorize_Contract_Terms)  
  – QA must happen before the final authorization; signing off on terms without QA is prohibited.  
• chainresponse(Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Transfer_Funds)  
  – Once the offer is complete, the next *executed* step (possibly after other silent/automatic checks) must ultimately be the disbursement. This keeps the queue “clean” and prevents long-dormant, half-finished offers.  
• chainsuccession(Quality_Assurance_Review  Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package)  
  – Immediately after QA, the case moves to assembling the final offer; no other business step is allowed in between. This mirrors an assembly-line hand-off pattern.

Business / regulatory motive  
• CFPB and OCC exam manuals emphasize “effective challenge” and dual control (maker-checker) before customer communication or disbursement. The various response/precedence rules codify that twin-control flow.


4.  Alternative-path guarantees

• altresponse(Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer)  
  – If funds are disbursed, the customer must eventually be informed, but the notice can be email, text, or postal—hence “alternative” response. The rule focuses on *at least one* notification after disbursement.  
• altprecedence(Notify_Customer  Transfer_Funds)  
  – Notification can also happen before funds move (e.g., “Your loan will be funded tomorrow”). Either ordering is allowed, but at least one of the two sequences must be satisfied, ensuring the customer never goes uninformed.  
• altsuccession(Gather_Additional_Documents  Quality_Assurance_Review)  
  – Either C precedes E or E precedes C, but both must happen. This flexibility supports scenarios where QA starts in parallel (e.g., verifying ID docs while other income proofs are still missing).

Business / regulatory motive  
• Consumer-protection rules mandate timely, understandable disclosure. The “alt-” family allows different legitimate service patterns while guaranteeing the essential obligation (disclosure) is met.


5.  Prohibitions on invalid combinations

• noncoexistence(Transfer_Funds × Receive_Application)  
  – “We can’t pay out money on the *same* case that is still at the ‘received’ stage.” Prevents race conditions where a funding batch process accidentally grabs an un-reviewed application copy.  
• nonsuccession(Notify_Customer  Preliminary_Credit_Check)  
  – Once the customer has been formally notified of a decision/terms, the system must not go back and run another credit check; that would undermine fair-dealing and data integrity.  
• nonchainsuccession(Authorize_Contract_Terms  Notify_Customer)  
  – The very next step after authorization cannot be an immediate notification. Some internal operation (e.g., applying final pricing, generating documents) must take place in-between; this enforces a “cool-off” or document-generation buffer.

Business / regulatory motive  
• These negative constraints protect against clerical or system errors that could lead to either premature funding, unfair credit re-pulls, or incomplete customer disclosures—each an audit or reputational risk.


6.  Putting it all together: a typical happy-path trace

A. Receive_Application  
B. Preliminary_Credit_Check  
C. Gather_Additional_Documents  
E. Quality_Assurance_Review  
F. Authorize_Contract_Terms  
D. Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  
G. Transfer_Funds  
H. Notify_Customer  

• All mandatory existences are satisfied, “Z” never occurs, credit check is exactly once, QA precedes authorization, and funding only occurs after the offer is assembled.  
• Alternative and chain rules ensure the customer is informed (H) and that no extra steps creep between QA and package assembly or between package assembly and funding.


7.  Strategic business value of such a stringent model

1.  Risk containment: The graph restricts *when* money can leave the bank, ensuring every compliance and QA gate is passed first.  
2.  Auditability & transparency: The model is *executable documentation*. Auditors can replay event logs and automatically flag violations of any rule.  
3.  Regulatory alignment:  
   – Fair lending  single credit pull, documented decision drivers.  
   – Truth-in-Lending / Reg Z  mandatory post-funding or pre-funding customer notice.  
   – OCC “Three Lines of Defense”  QA before authorization, maker–checker sequencing.  
4.  Customer experience: Eliminates contradictory communications (no credit-check after decision, no silent funding), and guarantees prompt, predictable updates.  
5.  Operational efficiency: Chain/alt rules encode hand-offs that shorten cycle time while still allowing parallelism (altsuccession). Violations instantly highlight process bottlenecks or training gaps.

In short, the DECLARE model functions as a machine-checkable blueprint for a highly controlled, regulator-friendly loan-approval life-cycle. It balances strict compliance (preventing illegal or unethical states) with business flexibility (alternative, but safe, execution paths) to ensure that every funded loan is defensible under both internal policy and external law.
