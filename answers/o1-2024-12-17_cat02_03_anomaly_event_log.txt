**Overview:**  
In a standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process, the typical order of activities is generally as follows:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition (PR)**: An internal request to procure goods/services.
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**: Managerial approval of the requisition.
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**: A formal order issued to the supplier based on the approved requisition.
4. **Receive Goods**: The ordered items are delivered, and a goods receipt is recorded.
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**: The supplier sends an invoice requesting payment.
6. **Match Invoice to PO (Three-Way Match)**: The invoice is matched with the PO and the goods receipt to ensure accuracy.
7. **Release Payment**: After successful match and any necessary approvals, payment is released to the vendor.
8. **Close Case**: The process instance is closed once all steps are completed correctly.

When analyzing the event log, any deviations from this logical sequence may represent anomalies. Let’s identify these anomalies case by case.

### Case 1001  
**Sequence:**  
- Create Purchase Requisition (2024-02-01 08:00)  
- Approve Purchase Requisition (2024-02-01 08:15)  
- Issue Purchase Order (2024-02-01 09:00)  
- Receive Goods (2024-02-02 10:00)  
- Vendor Invoice Received (2024-02-02 11:30)  
- Match Invoice to PO (2024-02-05 09:00)  
- Release Payment (2024-02-06 10:00)  
- Close Case (2024-02-07 15:00)  

**Analysis:**  
This sequence follows a standard, expected order:
1. PR is created and approved before issuing a PO.
2. Goods are received after the PO is issued.
3. The invoice is received after the goods have arrived.
4. The invoice is matched to the PO before payment.
5. Payment is released only after a successful match.

**Conclusion:**  
No apparent anomalies in Case 1001.

### Case 1002  
**Sequence:**  
- Create Purchase Requisition (2024-02-01 08:30)  
- Issue Purchase Order (2024-02-01 08:40)  
- Vendor Invoice Received (2024-02-03 07:00)  
- Release Payment (2024-02-03 07:15)  
- Approve Purchase Requisition (2024-02-03 08:00)  
- Receive Goods (2024-02-04 09:00)  
- Match Invoice to PO (2024-02-05 08:00)  
- Close Case (2024-02-06 16:00)

**Anomalies Identified:**
1. **PO Issued Before Approval of the Requisition:**  
   The PO is issued (2024-02-01 08:40) before the PR is approved (2024-02-03 08:00). Typically, a PR must be approved before a PO can be legally and procedurally issued to the vendor.
   
2. **Payment Released Before Goods are Received and Before Invoice is Matched:**  
   Payment is released (2024-02-03 07:15) even before the PR is approved or the goods are received (2024-02-04 09:00). Additionally, the invoice is not matched to the PO until after the payment is already made (2024-02-05 08:00). This is a clear deviation from best practices, as payment should only be released after ensuring the invoice matches the PO and received goods.

**Why Problematic?**  
- Releasing a PO before approval may lead to unauthorized or unnecessary purchasing commitments.  
- Paying before verifying goods receipt and invoice accuracy exposes the company to risks such as incorrect payments, paying for items never received, or losing leverage if goods are not delivered as promised.

### Case 1003  
**Sequence:**  
- Create Purchase Requisition (2024-02-02 09:00)  
- Approve Purchase Requisition (2024-02-02 09:10)  
- Issue Purchase Order (2024-02-02 10:00)  
- Release Payment (2024-02-08 11:00)  
- Vendor Invoice Received (2024-02-09 12:00)  
- Receive Goods (2024-02-10 13:00)  
- Match Invoice to PO (2024-02-11 14:00)  
- Close Case (2024-02-12 10:00)

**Anomalies Identified:**
1. **Payment Released Before Receiving the Invoice and Goods:**  
   Payment is made on 2024-02-08, but the invoice is only received on 2024-02-09 and goods are received on 2024-02-10. Normally, you would wait to receive and verify both the invoice and the goods before releasing payment.

**Why Problematic?**  
- Paying in advance of receiving the invoice and goods eliminates the company’s ability to confirm that the supplier’s request for payment is accurate. This could lead to overpayment, payment for nonexistent or incomplete deliveries, and compliance issues.

### Case 1004  
**Sequence:**  
- Create Purchase Requisition (2024-02-05 10:00)  
- Approve Purchase Requisition (2024-02-05 10:15)  
- Receive Goods (2024-02-06 09:00)  
- Issue Purchase Order (2024-02-06 09:15)  
- Vendor Invoice Received (2024-02-07 08:00)  
- Match Invoice to PO (2024-02-07 08:30)  
- Release Payment (2024-02-07 09:00)  
- Close Case (2024-02-08 11:00)

**Anomalies Identified:**
1. **Goods Received Before PO Issuance:**  
   Goods are received at 2024-02-06 09:00, but the PO is only issued at 2024-02-06 09:15. Typically, the vendor will not ship goods without having a PO in hand. Receiving goods before issuing a PO suggests that the procurement controls are not working as intended, or an informal arrangement occurred outside the standard process.

**Why Problematic?**  
- This could indicate that goods were ordered unofficially (possibly verbally or through informal means) before a formal PO was issued, undermining the control mechanisms that ensure proper authorization, budget checks, and audit trails.  
- It can lead to confusion in record-keeping, audit compliance issues, and difficulty enforcing contract terms.

---

**Overall Conclusion:**  
- **Case 1001:** Follows the standard process flow, no anomalies.  
- **Case 1002:** Payment released and PO issued without proper approvals and before goods receipt and invoice matching.  
- **Case 1003:** Payment released before receiving invoice and goods.  
- **Case 1004:** Goods received before the purchase order was issued.

**Why These Anomalies Are Problematic:**  
Such deviations from the standard P2P process can lead to financial risk (e.g., paying for incorrect or undelivered goods), compliance issues (not following company policy or legal requirements), and process inefficiencies. Ensuring that each step of the P2P process occurs in a logical, controlled order is essential to maintain financial integrity, compliance, and supplier relationship management.
