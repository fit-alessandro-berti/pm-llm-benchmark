9.5/10.0

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Sequence Determination (Req 1):** Correctly uses `group_concat(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp)` within a CTE grouped by `case_id`. This accurately constructs the ordered activity sequence for each case.
2.  **Variant Identification (Req 2):** The `variants` CTE effectively produces unique variant strings per case, and the `variant_counts` CTE correctly groups by these strings to identify unique variants.
3.  **Counting & Ranking (Req 3):** `variant_counts` correctly calculates the frequency (`COUNT(*)`). `top_variants` correctly uses `row_number() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC)` to rank the variants and filters for the top `K` using `WHERE rn <= :K`. This accurately identifies the top K variants based on frequency. The use of `row_number` handles ties consistently (by assigning distinct ranks), which is a standard approach for "top K".
4.  **Filtering & Event Return (Req 4):** The final `SELECT` correctly joins the original `event_log` table (`e`) back to the `variants` CTE (`v`) on `case_id`. The `WHERE v.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)` clause accurately filters to include only events from cases whose complete activity sequence matches one of the identified top K variants. It correctly returns all columns from the original events (`e.*`).
5.  **DuckDB Syntax & Structure:** The query uses standard SQL features well-supported by DuckDB, including CTEs, `group_concat WITHIN GROUP`, and window functions (`row_number`). The CTE structure significantly aids readability and logical flow. The use of `:K` is appropriate for parameterization.
6.  **Clarity:** The query is well-structured with explanatory comments for each CTE step.

**Minor Criticisms (Hypercritical View):**

*   **Tie-breaking:** While `row_number()` is a valid way to get *at most* K results, the prompt doesn't explicitly define tie-breaking behavior if multiple variants share the same frequency at the Kth rank boundary. Using `RANK()` or `DENSE_RANK()` might be preferred if the requirement was "include all variants *tied* for the Kth place". However, `row_number()` is a common and acceptable interpretation of "top K". This is a very minor point, bordering on pedantic without further specification in the prompt.
*   **Separator Choice:** Using '->' as a separator assumes activity names do not contain this specific substring. While common, a less likely character could theoretically be safer, but this is standard practice.

**Overall:** The query is robust, correct according to the prompt's requirements, uses appropriate DuckDB/SQL features, and is well-structured. The minor points noted are standard interpretations or practices and do not constitute significant flaws. The score reflects a near-flawless execution of the requirements.
