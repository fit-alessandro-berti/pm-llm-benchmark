### **Analysis of Deviations from the Normative Process**

#### **Case 2 (Case ID 2)**
- **Activities in Order**:
  `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Package items`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`
- **Violation**:
  - **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"**.
    - **Rule Violated**: The normative process states: "after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment... Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'" It also states: "'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping".
    - **Explanation**: In Case 2, "Package items" (at 10:00) occurs before "Authorize payment" (at 10:30). This violates the rule that payment must be authorized *before* items are packaged.

#### **Case 3 (Case ID 3)**
- **Activities in Order**:
  `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Cancel order`  `Ship order`  `Close order`
- **Violations**:
  1. **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"**.
     - **Rule Violated**: The normative process states: "'Ship order' should ... never after a cancellation."
     - **Explanation**: In Case 3, "Ship order" (at 10:30) occurs after "Cancel order" (at 10:00). This directly violates the stated rule.
  2. **"Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment" (implying a deviation from standard cancellation or fulfillment paths)**.
     - **Rule Violated**: The normative process outlines two main paths after "Check inventory":
         - **Sufficient Inventory**: `Authorize payment` -> `Package items` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`.
         - **Insufficient Inventory**: `Cancel order` -> `Close order`.
     - **Explanation**: In Case 3, "Authorize payment" occurs, suggesting the "sufficient inventory" path was initially followed. However, the process then deviates to "Cancel order." The normative description implies cancellation is a direct result of insufficient inventory discovered during "Check inventory." If inventory was sufficient (leading to "Authorize payment"), a subsequent "Cancel order" is not part of the described normative flow. If inventory was insufficient, "Authorize payment" should not have occurred. Thus, this sequence is a deviation.

#### **Case 5 (Case ID 5)**
- **Activities in Order**:
  `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`
- **Violation**:
  - **"Package items" activity is missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order"**.
    - **Rule Violated**: The normative process states: "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" It also states: "'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping".
    - **Explanation**: In Case 5, the process goes directly from "Authorize payment" (at 10:30) to "Ship order" (at 11:00), skipping the mandatory "Package items" step.

### **Summary of Violating Cases and Violations**

- **Case 2**: Violates the normative process because "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".
    - **Rule violated**: "Authorize payment" must precede "Package items".
- **Case 3**: Violates the normative process due to two issues:
    1. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".
       - **Rule violated**: Shipping is not allowed after cancellation.
    2. "Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment".
       - **Rule violated**: This sequence does not align with either the sufficient inventory path (which proceeds to packaging/shipping) or the insufficient inventory path (which cancels directly after inventory check, before payment authorization).
- **Case 5**: Violates the normative process because the "Package items" activity is missing.
    - **Rule violated**: "Package items" must occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".

### **Non-Violating Cases**

- **Case 1**: `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Authorize payment` -> `Package items` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`.
    - This case perfectly follows the "sufficient inventory" path described in the normative process.
- **Case 4**: `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Cancel order` -> `Close order`.
    - This case perfectly follows the "insufficient inventory" path described in the normative process.
