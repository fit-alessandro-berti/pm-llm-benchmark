3.5/10.0

**Evaluation:**

The solution provided demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of the optimal way to solve this problem in modern SQL. The choice of a window function (`COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`) is superior in both elegance and likely performance to a more traditional `GROUP BY`/`JOIN` approach. The accompanying explanation is exceptionally clear, accurate, and well-structured.

However, the evaluation must be performed with "utmost strictness," and the answer contains a single, critical, and disqualifying flaw.

**Critical Flaw:**

The provided SQL query is **syntactically invalid** and will fail to execute in DuckDB or any other standard SQL engine.

*   **The Error:** The outer `SELECT` clause references the alias `el` (e.g., `el.case_id`, `el.activity`). This alias is defined for the `event_log` table *inside* the subquery and is not visible to the outer query. The outer query operates on the derived table aliased as `EventsWithCount`, and thus all column references in the outer `SELECT` must be prefixed with `EventsWithCount.` (e.g., `EventsWithCount.case_id`).

As written, the query will produce a "referenced table not found" or "invalid identifier" error.

**Conclusion:**

The primary task was to "craft a DuckDB SQL query." The query provided is non-functional. While the logical approach and the explanation are excellent, they cannot compensate for a primary artifact that fails to execute. Under a hypercritical lens, an answer that does not run is a fundamental failure. The score is saved from the absolute minimum only because the underlying logic and explanatory text are of very high quality, proving that the author understood *how* to solve the problem but failed in the execution and verification of the final code.
