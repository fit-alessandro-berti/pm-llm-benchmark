**Grade: 9.5 / 10.0**

**Evaluation:**

The provided DuckDB SQL query is excellent. It correctly addresses all the requirements of the prompt using clear, well-structured SQL with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and helpful comments. The logic is sound and follows the requested steps precisely.

1.  **Requirement 1 (Activity Sequence per Case):** Correctly implemented in the `case_variants` CTE using `string_agg` with the essential `ORDER BY timestamp` clause to ensure the correct sequence.
2.  **Requirement 2 (Identify Unique Variants):** Implicitly handled by grouping by the generated `variant` string in the `variant_freq` CTE.
3.  **Requirement 3 (Count Cases per Variant & Top K):** Correctly implemented in the `variant_freq` CTE using `COUNT(*)`, `GROUP BY variant`, `ORDER BY n_cases DESC`, and `LIMIT ${K}`.
4.  **Requirement 4 (Filter Original Events):** Correctly implemented by identifying the `case_id`s belonging to the top K variants in the `top_cases` CTE and then joining the original `event_log` table with this set of cases in the final `SELECT` statement.

**Hypercritical Analysis & Justification for Minor Deduction (-0.5 points):**

While the query is functionally perfect and highly robust, applying the "utmost strictness" reveals one extremely minor point:

1.  **Delimiter Choice in `string_agg`:** The query uses `' '` (two spaces) as the delimiter. While technically valid and functional, this is a slightly unconventional choice. A single space (`' '`) or a more distinct delimiter like `' -> '` or `'|'` is often preferred to minimize the (admittedly very small) risk of collision if an activity name itself could potentially contain two consecutive spaces. This isn't a logical flaw but a minor point of potential fragility under extreme edge cases and stylistic preference.

**Why not lower?**

*   **No Logical Flaws:** The core logic for aggregation, ordering, limiting, and joining is entirely correct.
*   **No Inaccuracies:** The query produces the exact result requested by the prompt.
*   **Clarity:** The query is exceptionally clear due to CTEs and comments. The comment even explicitly mentions that `string_agg` preserves the order specified.
*   **Efficiency:** The approach is standard and generally efficient for this type of analysis in DuckDB.
*   **Final `ORDER BY`:** The `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp` in the final select is not strictly required by the prompt's output definition *but* is excellent practice for presenting event log data predictably and is often implicitly desired. It doesn't detract from the solution.

**Conclusion:**

This is a near-perfect answer. The structure, logic, and clarity are commendable. The single, very minor deduction reflects the hypercritical requirement applied to the slightly unconventional delimiter choice, which, while functional, isn't the most robust or standard option available.
