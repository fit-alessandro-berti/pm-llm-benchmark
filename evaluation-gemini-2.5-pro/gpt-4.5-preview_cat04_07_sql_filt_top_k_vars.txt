**8.5 / 10.0**

**Critique:**

1.  **`<K>` Placeholder:** The most significant issue under strict evaluation is the use of `<K>` as a placeholder. While the intention is clear (replace it with an integer), the provided code is *not* directly executable DuckDB SQL syntax as presented. A truly complete answer would either use a specific value for K, assume K=some_value (e.g., `LIMIT 10`), or demonstrate how K would be parameterized (e.g., using prepared statements if the context allowed, although that's outside the scope of a single query). This lack of direct executability is a flaw when assessed strictly.

2.  **Efficiency Consideration (Minor):** The query involves calculating `activity_sequence` for *all* cases (`case_variants`), then calculating counts for *all* unique sequences (`variant_counts` before the `LIMIT`), and *then* joining back to `case_variants` (`top_k_cases`). While logically correct and likely performant in DuckDB for many scenarios, one *could* potentially integrate the `LIMIT` earlier using window functions if performance on extremely large datasets became a critical concern (though the current approach is often clearer and standard). This is a very minor point, more of an alternative consideration than a flaw, but noted under hypercritical review. The current CTE approach is perfectly valid and readable.

3.  **Clarity of Output Ordering:** The final `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp` is good practice for presenting the results predictably. While not explicitly mandated for the *final event list* in the prompt (only for determining the sequence *within* a case), it significantly enhances the usability of the output. This is a positive aspect.

4.  **Correctness of Logic:** The core logic is sound.
    *   `case_variants` correctly uses `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp` to define the process variant per case.
    *   `variant_counts` correctly aggregates these variants, counts them, and uses `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT` to find the top K sequences.
    *   `top_k_cases` correctly identifies the `case_id`s belonging to those top K variant sequences by joining back.
    *   The final `SELECT` correctly joins the original `event_log` with the identified `case_id`s to retrieve the required events.

**Summary:**

The solution demonstrates a strong understanding of SQL, CTEs, aggregation, window function alternatives (`STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY`), and correctly implements the logic requested in the prompt. The structure is clear and readable. The primary deduction comes from the non-executable `<K>` placeholder, which violates the strict requirement for a complete, runnable query. Other points are very minor efficiency/alternative considerations rather than outright flaws.
