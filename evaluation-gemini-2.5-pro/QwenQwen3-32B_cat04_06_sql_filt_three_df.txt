**Evaluation:**

1.  **Correctness of Sequence Detection:** The query correctly uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to order events within each case and then joins the `ordered_events` CTE with itself twice (`o2.rn = o1.rn + 1`, `o3.rn = o1.rn + 2`) to find instances where the three specified activities occur in direct succession. This accurately fulfills the requirement of "no other event from the same case in between them". The `WHERE` clause correctly filters for the specific activity names. (Score: 10/10)
2.  **Correctness of Timing Condition:** The query calculates the time difference between `o3.timestamp` ('Confirm Order') and `o2.timestamp` ('Create Order') using `EPOCH(o3.timestamp) - EPOCH(o2.timestamp)` to get seconds, then divides by `86400.0` (correctly using float division) to get days. The condition `> 5` accurately reflects "more than 5 days". This is a valid and correct approach in DuckDB. (Score: 10/10)
3.  **Correctness of Exclusion Logic:** The subquery correctly identifies the `case_id`s that meet *both* the sequence and timing criteria (using `DISTINCT` appropriately). The outer query uses `WHERE el.case_id NOT IN (...)` to correctly exclude *all* events associated with these identified cases. (Score: 10/10)
4.  **Result Set:** The query selects `el.*` from the original `event_log` table, ensuring all original columns are returned for the non-excluded cases. The final `ORDER BY` is not strictly required by the prompt but is good practice and doesn't hurt. (Score: 10/10)
5.  **Efficiency/Style:**
    *   The use of CTE and `ROW_NUMBER` is standard and appropriate.
    *   The triple join on the CTE is necessary for this approach to sequence detection and is acceptable.
    *   Using `NOT IN` is generally acceptable in DuckDB.
    *   **Minor Point:** Comparing epoch seconds directly (`EPOCH(o3.timestamp) - EPOCH(o2.timestamp) > 5 * 86400`) might be marginally more robust or performant than using floating-point division and comparison, avoiding potential float precision issues, however minuscule. This is a very minor style/robustness point, not a functional error. (Score: -0.5 points)
    *   **Minor Point:** The `ROW_NUMBER()` ordering relies solely on `timestamp`. If two events within the same case have the exact same timestamp, their relative order becomes non-deterministic, which could theoretically affect sequence detection. Adding a tie-breaker to the `ORDER BY` within `ROW_NUMBER()` (if a suitable column existed) would make it fully deterministic. Given the prompt doesn't specify tie-breaking, this is a minor theoretical gap. (Score: -1.0 points)

**Overall:** The query is functionally correct and addresses all parts of the prompt accurately. It uses appropriate DuckDB syntax. The minor points related to floating-point comparison versus integer comparison on seconds, and the lack of explicit tie-breaking in the window function ordering prevent a perfect score under hypercritical evaluation.
