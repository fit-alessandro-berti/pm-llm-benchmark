**Violating Cases:**
1.  **Case 2**
2.  **Case 3**
3.  **Case 5**

**Explanation of Violations:**

**Case 2:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items  Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order
*   **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".
*   **Rule Violated:** The normative description states, *"Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'"* and *"'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping."* In Case 2, packaging occurs before payment authorization, which is a direct violation of this rule.

**Case 3:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  **Ship order**  Close order
*   **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".
*   **Rule Violated:** The normative description states, *"In such a case [insufficient inventory, leading to cancellation], after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to 'Cancel order.' Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping), and thus the next reasonable step is to 'Close order.'"* and *"'Ship order' should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation."* In Case 3, the order is shipped after it has been canceled, which is a clear violation. The presence of "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" is also unusual given the typical cancellation flow (which implies inventory was insufficient, making prior authorization for fulfillment unnecessary), but the primary violation here is shipping a canceled order.

**Case 5:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order (Missing "Package items")
*   **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs without "Package items" preceding it.
*   **Rule Violated:** The normative description states, *"Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'"* and *"'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping."* Case 5 skips the "Package items" activity entirely after "Authorize payment" and directly proceeds to "Ship order," violating the required sequence.
