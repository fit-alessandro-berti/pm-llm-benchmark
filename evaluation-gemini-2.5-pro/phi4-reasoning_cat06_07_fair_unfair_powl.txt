Below are two POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) models that represent the GlobalTeq Solutions hiring process. Both models follow similar steps (application receipt, resume parsing with a loop for data completeness, skill assessment, cultural evaluation, managerial review, and final decision), but they differ in how they handle the cultural fit check.

**Model 1: POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

In this model, after the skill assessment, there is an XOR branching where one branch represents a standard cultural fit evaluation (“CulturalFitCheck”) and the other branch represents a “CommunityAffiliationCheck” that gives subtle preferential treatment if the applicant has certain affiliations.

Below is the Python code using pm4py constructs:

-------------------------------------------------
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities for Model 1 (with potential unfairness)

# Initial application receipt and resume parsing with a loop to ensure data completeness:
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
# The description implies a check happens, and if incomplete, info is requested, then the check repeats.
# A typical LOOP construct *(A, B) executes A, then either exits or executes B and then A again.
# So, A should be the check, B the request.
resume_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Skill assessment stage:
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# XOR branching for cultural fit evaluation:
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")         # Standard cultural fit
community_affiliation = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # Branch giving subtle advantage
xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_affiliation])

# Managerial review and final decision:
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Combine all parts in a strict partial order model:
root_model_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_app,
    resume_loop,
    skill_assess,
    xor_cultural,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Define execution order (edges):
root_model_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, resume_loop)
root_model_unfair.order.add_edge(resume_loop, skill_assess)
root_model_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, xor_cultural)
root_model_unfair.order.add_edge(xor_cultural, managerial_review)
root_model_unfair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

# The model above represents the hiring process where the cultural fit evaluation may be biased
# by providing an alternative branch that favors applicants with community affiliations.
```
-------------------------------------------------

**Model 2: POWL Model Without Unfairness**

In this revised model, the special community-based branch is removed. Instead, all applicants proceed through a uniform cultural fit evaluation (“CulturalFitCheck”). The rest of the process remains similar.

Below is the corresponding Python code:

-------------------------------------------------
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities for Model 2 (without potential unfairness)

# Initial application receipt and resume parsing with a loop to ensure data completeness:
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
resume_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Skill assessment stage:
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# Uniform cultural fit evaluation:
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Only one branch used here

# Managerial review and final decision:
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Combine all parts in a strict partial order model:
root_model_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_app,
    resume_loop,
    skill_assess,
    cultural_fit,  # No XOR branching here
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Define execution order (edges):
root_model_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, resume_loop)
root_model_fair.order.add_edge(resume_loop, skill_assess)
root_model_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_fit)
root_model_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, managerial_review)
root_model_fair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

# This model ensures that all applicants are evaluated using the same standard
# for cultural fit, thereby removing the specific source of potential bias described.
```
