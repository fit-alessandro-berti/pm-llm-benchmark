**Cases Violating the Normative Process:**

Cases 2, 3, and 5 violate the normative process.

**Explanation of Violations:**

**Case 2:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Violation:** The activity "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".
*   **Rule Violated:** The normative description states: *"after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment... Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items'."* This implies the order: Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items. The description also explicitly states: *"Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging...*". Case 2 reverses the order of "Authorize payment" and "Package items".

**Case 3:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Violations:**
    1.  **Inappropriate activity in cancellation path:** The activity "Authorize payment" occurs, followed by "Cancel order". The normative description for an insufficient inventory scenario is: *"after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to 'Cancel order'."* This implies that if an order is to be canceled due to inventory issues, payment authorization should not occur. The presence of "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" suggests an inconsistency with the described cancellation flow.
    2.  **Shipping after cancellation:** The activity "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".
*   **Rules Violated:**
    1.  For the first violation, the description for insufficient inventory scenarios implies that payment authorization is skipped: *"Receive, Check, Cancel, Close—for insufficient inventory scenarios."*
    2.  For the second violation, the description explicitly states: *"Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)..."* and *"'Ship order' should... never after a cancellation."*

**Case 5:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Violation:** The activity "Package items" is missing.
*   **Rule Violated:** The normative description for the sufficient inventory scenario states: *"Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'."* This means "Package items" is a required step between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order". The sequence is explicitly given as: *"Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close—reflects the expected flow when inventory is not a limiting factor."* Case 5 skips the "Package items" step.

**Compliant Cases:**

*   **Case 1:** Follows the normative process for sufficient inventory: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Case 4:** Follows the normative process for insufficient inventory: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.
