10.0

The provided SQL query is a well-structured and correct solution to the problem described in the prompt. Here's a breakdown of why it deserves a high score:

1.  **Correct Interpretation of Sequence and Direct Succession:**
    *   The query correctly uses `LEAD(activity)` and `LEAD(activity, 2)` window functions partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp`. This accurately identifies the specified three-activity sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order') in direct succession. If any other event from the same case were to occur between these, the `LEAD` function would pick up that intermediate event, and the sequence condition would correctly fail.

2.  **Correct Time Elapsed Calculation and Condition:**
    *   The query correctly identifies the timestamps for the 'Create Order' event (`next_timestamp`) and the 'Confirm Order' event (`next_next_timestamp`) within the identified sequence.
    *   The condition `(next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'` accurately checks if the time elapsed between these two specific events is more than 5 days. The interval arithmetic and comparison are standard SQL and appropriate for DuckDB.

3.  **Correct Identification and Exclusion of Cases:**
    *   The `bad_cases` CTE correctly gathers `DISTINCT case_id`s that meet both the sequence and timing criteria. Using `DISTINCT` is important as a case only needs to contain one such problematic sequence to be excluded entirely.
    *   The final `SELECT` statement correctly retrieves all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` for cases whose `case_id` is `NOT IN` the set of `bad_cases`. This fulfills the requirement to exclude all events from the identified cases.

4.  **Readability and Structure:**
    *   The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) (`events_with_lead`, `bad_cases`) makes the query modular, readable, and easy to understand. The logic flows clearly from identifying sequence candidates to filtering them and then applying the exclusion.

5.  **Handling of Edge Cases:**
    *   The use of `LEAD` naturally handles cases where the sequence might appear at the beginning, middle, or end of a case's event stream. If a sequence is incomplete (e.g., fewer than 3 events remaining in the case, or the activities don't match), `LEAD` will return `NULL`s or different values, causing the `WHERE` clause conditions in `bad_cases` to correctly fail for that specific starting point.

6.  **Adherence to Prompt Specifics:**
    *   The query uses the specified table name (`event_log`) and column names (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`).
    *   It returns "all events" (via `SELECT *`) from the non-excluded cases.
    *   The implicit grouping via `PARTITION BY` and ordering within window functions, along with explicit filtering, meet the "proper grouping, ordering, and filtering" requirement in the context of identifying the target cases. The final output order is not specified, so no `ORDER BY` is needed on the outer query.

**Hypercritical Evaluation:**
Even under hypercritical review, the query stands up very well:
*   **Timestamp Ties:** The problem relies on `ORDER BY timestamp` to define event sequence. If multiple events within a case share the exact same timestamp, the order among them might be non-deterministic, potentially affecting sequence detection. However, the problem prompt does not provide a tie-breaking column or specify behavior for ties. The query uses the available information (`timestamp`) correctly. In the absence of further specification, this is the standard and expected approach. The query is deterministic given a specific database's tie-breaking behavior, but results could vary across systems if ties are handled differently and no explicit tie-breaker is given. This is more a limitation of typical problem specifications than a flaw in this specific query logic given the spec.
*   **`SELECT *`**: While explicit column listing is often preferred in production, `SELECT *` is acceptable here as the prompt asks to "return all events," implying all original columns.
*   **Performance of `NOT IN`**: While `NOT EXISTS` or `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL` are sometimes alternatives, `NOT IN` with a subquery returning distinct, non-null IDs (as `case_id` would be) is generally well-optimized by modern query planners like DuckDB's and is perfectly clear.

The solution is robust, logically sound, and directly addresses all requirements of the prompt. It demonstrates a strong understanding of SQL window functions and conditional aggregation logic. Given the problem statement, this query is effectively flawless.
