**Critique:**

1.  **Correctness and Logic:** The query correctly implements the required logic. It uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) `filtered_cases` to first identify `case_id`s that have six or fewer events (`COUNT(*) <= 6` applied after grouping using `HAVING`). It then joins this list of valid `case_id`s back to the original `event_log` table to retrieve all columns (`el.*`) for the events belonging to those cases. This perfectly matches the requirements of the prompt.

2.  **Clarity:** The use of a CTE makes the query very readable and logically structured. The steps (identify valid cases, then retrieve their events) are distinct. Alias usage (`el`, `fc`) is standard.

3.  **Efficiency:** The approach using a CTE with aggregation/`HAVING` followed by a JOIN is a standard and generally efficient pattern for this type of filtering in SQL databases like DuckDB.

4.  **Adherence to Prompt:** The query uses the specified table (`event_log`) and column names (`case_id`). It correctly filters based on the count of events per case (<= 6) and returns the full set of event data (`el.*`) for the remaining cases.

**Reason for Score Deduction (Minor Point Under Strict Evaluation):**

*   While `SELECT el.*` is functionally correct and often acceptable, especially when the requirement is to return "the full set of events", the most robust and explicit practice in production code is often to list the required columns explicitly (e.g., `SELECT el.case_id, el.activity, el.timestamp, ...`). This prevents issues if the underlying table schema changes unexpectedly (e.g., adding large unwanted columns) and makes the query's output contract clearer. However, given the prompt asks for the "full set of events" and guarantees specific columns exist, `el.*` is a reasonable interpretation and fulfills the request concisely. This is a very minor point, reflecting the hypercritical grading requirement, docking half a point for not being maximally explicit, although `el.*` is arguably the most direct way to satisfy "return the full set of events".

Overall, the query is an excellent, standard, and correct solution to the problem posed.
