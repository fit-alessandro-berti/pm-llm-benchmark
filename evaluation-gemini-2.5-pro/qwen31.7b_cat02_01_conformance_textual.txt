**Grade: 9.5/10.0**

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Identification of Violating Cases:** The answer correctly identifies Cases 2, 3, and 5 as the ones violating the normative process. This is accurate based on the provided description and event log.
2.  **Explanation of Violations:**
    *   **Case 2:** The explanation correctly identifies that "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment", violating the specified sequence ("Authorize payment" must precede "Package items"). This is clearly stated and accurate.
    *   **Case 3:** The explanation correctly identifies the core violation: "Ship Order" occurs after "Cancel Order", which is explicitly forbidden in the normative description. The phrasing "...violating the normative rule that **Ship** must occur **only after** **Cancel** (and not after cancellation)" contains a slight imprecision (it should probably say "never after cancellation" or similar), but the intended meaning is clear from the context and the subsequent clarification ("and not after cancellation"). The crucial violation is correctly pinpointed.
    *   **Case 5:** The explanation correctly identifies that "Package items" is missing before "Ship order", violating the required sequence ("Package items" must occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order"). The violation is well-explained.
3.  **Referencing Normative Description:** The explanations implicitly and sometimes explicitly reference the rules laid out in the normative description (e.g., sequence requirements, actions forbidden after cancellation).
4.  **Interpretation of Ambiguities:** The task required interpreting the description. The answer correctly interprets the standard paths and the explicit constraints provided, applying them logically to the event log.
5.  **Clarity and Structure:** The answer is well-structured, clearly listing each violating case and providing a concise explanation for the violation. The summary reinforces the findings.

**Strictness Critique:**
*   The only minor point is the phrasing in the Case 3 explanation ("Ship must occur only after Cancel"). While slightly awkward, the overall explanation makes the violation (shipping *after* cancellation is forbidden) perfectly clear. Given the context and the correct identification of the rule breach, this is a very minor issue.

**Conclusion:** The answer is excellent. It accurately identifies all violations and provides clear, correct explanations based directly on the normative process description. The slight phrasing issue in one explanation prevents a perfect 10.0 under hypercritical evaluation, but the analysis is otherwise flawless.
