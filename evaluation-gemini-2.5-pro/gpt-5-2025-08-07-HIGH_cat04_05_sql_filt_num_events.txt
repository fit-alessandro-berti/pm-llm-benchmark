9.8/10.0

This is an exceptionally strong and nearly flawless answer. It correctly solves the problem using two distinct, idiomatic, and efficient SQL patterns. The grading is hypercritical, and the minor deduction is based on a subtle imperfection in the second proposed solution.

### Positive Aspects:

1.  **Correctness:** Both queries are logically sound and produce the correct set of event rows as requested by the prompt. They correctly identify cases with six or fewer events and filter the log accordingly.
2.  **Completeness & Depth:** The answer provides two excellent and common solutions to this type of problem: one using a subquery/join and another using a window function. This demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of SQL.
3.  **Code Quality & Readability:** The SQL is well-formatted, uses clear aliases (`e`, `keep`, `t`), and is easy to understand.
4.  **Best Practices:** The inclusion of `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp` is a significant value-add. While not explicitly required by the prompt, it shows an understanding of the domain (process mining) where ordered events are crucial for analysis. It produces a deterministic and more useful result set.

### Hypercritical Flaws (Minor Deduction):

1.  **Imprecise Output Schema in Alternative Solution:** The prompt asks the query to "return only the events".
    *   The first solution (`JOIN`) perfectly adheres to this, as `SELECT e.*` returns only the original columns from the `event_log` table.
    *   The second solution (`Window Function`) uses `SELECT *` on a subquery that has an additional derived column, `n_events`. The final output therefore includes this extra column. While this is often useful, it is a strict deviation from "return *only* the events" (implying the original event schema). A perfect query would have explicitly selected the original columns or used DuckDB's `EXCLUDE` clause (e.g., `SELECT * EXCLUDE (n_events)`) to restore the original schema.

### Summary:

The answer is outstanding. It provides a perfect primary solution and an excellent, high-performance alternative. The only reason it does not receive a perfect 10.0 is the hypercritical instruction to penalize even minor flaws. The slightly altered output schema of the window function solution constitutes such a minor flaw. Nonetheless, the overall quality and demonstrated expertise are top-tier.
