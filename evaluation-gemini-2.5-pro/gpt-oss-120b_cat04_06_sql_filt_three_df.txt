### Grading Rationale

The provided SQL query attempts to solve the problem using a conceptually sound approach, leveraging advanced SQL features like window functions (`LEAD`), CTEs, and a DuckDB-specific feature (`QUALIFY`). However, the final submission is critically flawed by a fatal syntax error that renders it non-executable.

**Positive Aspects:**
*   **Correct Logical Approach:** The overall strategy is excellent. It correctly uses a `LEAD` function partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp` to identify the direct sequence of events.
*   **Correct Filtering:** The `WHERE` clause in the subquery correctly filters for the three required activities and applies the `> 5 days` time condition using `DATE_DIFF`.
*   **Correct Exclusion:** The final `WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)` clause correctly implements the requirement to exclude all events from the identified cases.

**Critical Flaws:**
1.  **Fatal Syntax Error:** The primary CTE, `sequence_cases`, is syntactically invalid. Its `SELECT` list references columns that do not exist (`ts_approve`, `ts_create`, `ts_confirm`). The subquery `ordered` provides columns named `ts`, `ts1`, and `ts2`, but the outer query fails to use them. This is not a minor typo but a fundamental error that makes the entire query fail.
2.  **Internal Inconsistency:** The `SELECT` list of the `sequence_cases` CTE also attempts to recalculate the date difference (`DATE_DIFF('day', ts_create, ts_confirm)`), again using the non-existent columns. This is logically inconsistent, as the correct filtering on this condition was already performed in the `WHERE` clause of the same CTE.
3.  **Unnecessary Complexity:** The `SELECT` list of the first CTE is needlessly complex. It selects and aliases several columns that are immediately discarded, as the only column used in the subsequent CTE is `case_id`. A simple `SELECT case_id` would have been sufficient, clearer, and would have avoided the syntax error.

**Conclusion:**
While the query demonstrates a strong grasp of the logical steps required to solve the problem, it fails on the basic requirement of being a valid, executable piece of code. The "hypercritical" grading standard demands that a non-functional query receives a low score. The errors go beyond a simple typo and indicate a significant oversight in the query's construction. Therefore, the answer does not meet the requirements of a correct solution, despite its sound underlying logic.
