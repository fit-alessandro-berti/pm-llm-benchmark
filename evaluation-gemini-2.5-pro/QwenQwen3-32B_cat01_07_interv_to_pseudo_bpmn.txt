**Exception Handling - AP Supervisor (Rita) Intervention:**

*   **Triggered by:**
    *   AP Clerk flagging an invoice for retrospective PO (from GW1.1).
    *   Escalation from AP Clerk/Purchasing Officer regarding unresolved purchasing discrepancies (from GW2.1 via AP Clerk).
    *   Escalation from AP Clerk regarding unresolved 3-way match discrepancies (from GW3.1).
    *   Escalation from AP Clerk regarding unresolvable manager queries (from GW5.1).
*   **Role:** Accounts Payable Supervisor
1.  **Task: Receive and Investigate Escalated Issue/Invoice**
    *   **Description:** AP Supervisor analyzes the exception, may contact suppliers (potentially involving Supplier Relationship Manager - Karen), coordinate with departments, or work with department heads.
2.  **Exclusive Gateway (GW-Rita): "Nature of Exception & Resolution Path?"**
    *   **Path: Missing PO for Informal Services:**
        *   **Task: Work with Department Head to Create Retrospective PO** (AP Supervisor)
        *   **Exclusive Gateway (GW-Rita.1): "Retrospective PO Obtained?"**
            *   **Path: Yes:**
                *   **Task: Return Invoice with Retrospective PO to AP Clerk** (AP Supervisor)
                *   **Transition:** To AP Clerk at **Task: Log Invoice in Accounting System** (Step 1, after PO is considered present).
            *   **Path: No (Retrospective PO Not Approved/Possible):**
                *   **Task: Decide to Reject Invoice** (AP Supervisor)
                *   **End Event: Invoice Rejected (by AP Supervisor)**
    *   **Path: Discrepancy Resolution (from Purchasing, 3-Way Match, or Manager Query):**
        *   **Task: Facilitate Resolution of Discrepancy** (AP Supervisor)
        *   **Exclusive Gateway (GW-Rita.2): "Issue Resolved and Invoice Validated/Corrected?"**
            *   **Path: Yes:**
                *   **Task: Return Invoice to Normal Flow** (AP Supervisor)
                *   **Transition:** To the step in the main process immediately preceding the point of escalation (e.g., re-attempt 3-way match at GW3, or resubmit for manager approval if that was the source). *The specific return point depends on the nature of the resolved issue.*
            *   **Path: No (Issue Unresolvable):**
                *   **Task: Decide to Reject Invoice** (AP Supervisor)
                *   **End Event: Invoice Rejected (by AP Supervisor)**

**Key Roles/Participants Involved:**
*   **Accounts Payable Clerk:** Primary handler of invoices, initial checks, logging, matching, forwarding, payment scheduling, and first point for some investigations.
*   **Purchasing Officer:** Confirms goods/service receipt, matches invoice against PO from purchasing perspective.
*   **Department Manager:** Provides final approval for invoices.
*   **Accounts Payable Supervisor:** Manages exceptions, complex discrepancies, and retrospective POs.
*   **Supplier Relationship Manager:** (Supporting) Liaises with suppliers to resolve PO or pricing issues when requested.
*   **System:** Performs automated tasks (e.g., sending notifications).
*   **Supplier:** External entity providing invoices and responding to queries.

---

**Key Artifacts/Data Objects:**
*   Invoice (received via email, logged in system)
*   Purchase Order (PO)
*   Confirmation from Purchasing (email or system update)
*   Approval Request (to Manager)
*   Approved Invoice / Rejection Notification
*   Payment Schedule Information
*   Communication with Supplier (emails, notes)

---

**Notes on Ambiguities and Consolidation:**
*   **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) Involvement:** Karen's involvement is described as indirect and supportive, invoked by AP, Purchasing, or AP Supervisor as needed for supplier communication, rather than a fixed step.
*   **Return Paths from Exception Handling:** The exact return point to the main flow after AP Supervisor intervention is dependent on the specific issue resolved and aims to reintegrate the invoice at the appropriate stage.
*   **Escalation Triggers:** While key escalations are noted, minor variations in when an issue is deemed "unresolvable" by a clerk/officer before escalating might exist.
*   **System Automation:** The extent of system automation (e.g., for notifications, logging) is based on explicit mentions but could be more pervasive. Mary mentions the system sends an automatic email for manager sign-off.
