## Final Solution
To extract all unique keys from a list of dictionaries, you can iterate through each dictionary, collect its keys, and use a `set` to automatically handle uniqueness. Finally, convert the set back to a list.

### Approach
1.  **Initialize a Set:** Create an empty set to store the unique keys. Sets are efficient for storing unique elements.
2.  **Iterate Through Dictionaries:** Loop through each dictionary in the input list.
3.  **Collect Keys:** For each dictionary, retrieve its keys using the `.keys()` method.
4.  **Update Set:** Add the retrieved keys to the set using the `.update()` method. This method adds all elements from an iterable (the keys) to the set, and duplicates are automatically ignored.
5.  **Convert to List:** After iterating through all dictionaries, convert the set containing the unique keys into a list using the `list()` constructor.

### Solution Code
```python
def get_unique_keys(list_of_dicts):
    """
    Extracts all unique keys from a list of dictionaries.

    Args:
        list_of_dicts: A list where each element is a dictionary.

    Returns:
        A list containing the unique keys found across all dictionaries.
        The order of keys in the returned list is not guaranteed
        (though it often reflects insertion order in recent Python versions).
    """
    unique_keys_set = set()  # Initialize an empty set to store unique keys
    
    # Iterate through each dictionary in the list
    for d in list_of_dicts:
        # Get the keys from the current dictionary and add them to the set
        # The update method efficiently adds all keys, duplicates are ignored by the set
        unique_keys_set.update(d.keys())
        
    # Convert the set of unique keys back to a list
    return list(unique_keys_set)

# Example usage:
list_d = [
    {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, 
    {'a': 3, 'c': 4}, 
    {'b': 5, 'd': 6}
]

unique_keys_list = get_unique_keys(list_d)
print(unique_keys_list) 
# Example Output (order might vary): ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] or ['b', 'a', 'd', 'c'] etc. 
```

### Explanation
1.  **`unique_keys_set = set()`**: An empty set is created. Sets only store unique elements, which is perfect for this task.
2.  **`for d in list_of_dicts:`**: This loop goes through each dictionary (`d`) present in the input `list_of_dicts`.
3.  **`unique_keys_set.update(d.keys())`**: For the current dictionary `d`, `d.keys()` returns a view object containing the dictionary's keys. The `update()` method takes these keys and adds them to `unique_keys_set`. If a key is already in the set, it's simply ignored, ensuring uniqueness.
4.  **`return list(unique_keys_set)`**: Finally, the set `unique_keys_set`, which now holds all the unique keys encountered, is converted into a list and returned.
