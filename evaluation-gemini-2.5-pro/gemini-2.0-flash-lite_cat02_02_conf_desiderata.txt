**6.0/10.0**

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Accuracy & Completeness (Normative Violations):**
    *   **Case 2:** Correctly identifies both normative violations (sequence error: Risk Assessment before Credit Check; logic error: Finalize Documentation after Rejection). Explanations are accurate based on the provided rules. (Good)

2.  **Accuracy & Completeness (Desiderata Deviations):**
    *   **Case 3:** Correctly identifies the three desiderata deviations (delayed Credit Check, delayed Inform Applicant, missing Follow-up Call). Correctly frames them as deviations, not violations. (Good)
    *   **Case 1:** **Major Omission:** The answer fails to identify that Case 1 *also* deviates from the desiderata by missing the recommended `Follow-up Call`. The desiderata description explicitly mentions this call is encouraged "sometime before closing the case". Case 1 proceeds directly from Finalize Documentation to Close Case without this call. This is a significant oversight in completeness, especially given the instruction for strictness. (Significant Penalty)

3.  **Interpretations and Justifications:**
    *   **Case 2:** Plausible interpretations (process error, manual mistake) are provided for the normative violations. Suggestion for corrective procedures is relevant. (Good)
    *   **Case 3:** Plausible interpretations (workload, delays) are provided for the timing deviations. Acknowledges the missing call is "problematic" but not a violation. (Good)
    *   **Case 1:** No interpretation is provided for the missed desideratum (Follow-up Call), as the deviation itself was missed. (Gap due to omission in point 2)
    *   **Clarity:** The distinction between normative violations and desiderata deviations is generally maintained clearly in the analysis of Cases 2 and 3. (Good)

**Summary of Flaws:**

*   **Primary Flaw:** The most significant flaw is the failure to identify the missing 'Follow-up Call' desideratum deviation in Case 1. The task required identifying *which cases* failed desiderata, implying a need to check all cases against the desiderata list. This oversight demonstrates a lack of complete analysis.
*   **Consequence:** Due to the primary flaw, the interpretation section is also incomplete, as it doesn't address the deviation in Case 1.

**Justification for Score (6.0/10.0):**

While the answer correctly identifies the most severe normative violations in Case 2 and the multiple desiderata deviations in Case 3, the failure to perform a complete analysis across all cases (missing the desideratum deviation in Case 1) is a critical error under the strict grading instructions. It shows a lack of thoroughness. The core concepts of normative vs. desiderata are understood and applied correctly where analysis *was* performed, but the incomplete application prevents a higher score. A 4.0 point deduction reflects the severity of the omission based on the hypercritical grading requirement.
